A crossroads where we makedecisions which will influence life on Earth well into the future of what we call time. Wecan fling open the doors of the mental and emotional prisons which have confined thehuman race for thousands of years. Or we can allow the agents of that control tocomplete their agenda for the mental, emotional, spiritual and physical enslavement ofevery man, woman and child on the planet with a world government, army, central bankand currency, underpinned by a microchipped population.I know that sounds fantastic, but if the human race lifted its eyes from the latest soapopera or game show for long enough to engage its brain, it would see that these eventsare not just going to happen - they are happening. The momentum for the centralisedcontrol of global politics, business, banking, military and media is gathering pace by thehour. The microchipping of people is already being suggested and, in many cases,underway. Whenever a hidden agenda is about to be implemented there is always theperiod when the hidden has to break the surface for the final push into physical reality.This is what we are seeing now in the explosion of mergers between global banking andbusiness empires, and the speed at which political and economic control is beingcentralised through the European Union, the United Nations, the World TradeOrganisation, the Multilateral Agreement on Investment, and the stream of otherglobalising bodies like the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and the G-7/G-8summits. Behind this constant and coordinated centralisation is a tribe of interbreedingbloodlines which can be traced to the ancient Middle and Near East. They emerged fromthere to become the royalty, aristocracy and priesthood of Europe before expanding theirpower across the world, largely through the ‘Great’ British Empire. This allowed the tribeto export its bloodlines to all the countries the British and European powers occupied,including the United States where they continue to run the show to this day. There havebeen just over 40 Presidents of the United States and 33 of them have been geneticallyrelated to two people, England’s King Alfred the Great and Charlemagne, the famousmonarch in 9th century France. Throughout this whole period the agenda of thisbloodline has been gradually implemented until we have reached the point today wherecentralised global control is possible.If you want to know what life will be like unless we wake up fast, take a look at NaziGermany. That is the world that awaits the global population as the plan I call thex"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Brotherhood Agenda unfolds across the year 2000 and into the first 12 years of the newcentury. 2012 particularly, appears to be a crucial year for reasons we shall discuss.People have no idea of the abyss we are staring into or the nature of the world we areleaving for our children to endure and most people don’t seem to care. They would muchrather ignore the obvious and go into denial of a truth that’s splatting them between theeyes. I feel like the cow who runs into the field screaming: “Hey, you know that truckthat takes some of our friends away every month? Well they don’t take them to anotherfield like we thought. They shoot them in the head, bleed them dry, cut them up, and putthe pieces into packets. Then those humans buy them and eat them!” Imagine what thereaction of the rest of the herd would be: “You’re crazy man. They’d never do that.Anyway, I’ve got shares in that trucking company and I get a good return. Shut up,you’re making waves.”The Agenda I am exposing has been unfolding over thousands of years to its currentpoint close to completion, because humanity has given away its mind and itsresponsibility. Humanity would rather do what it thinks is right for itself in the momentthan consider the wider consequences of its behaviour for human existence. Ignorance isbliss, we say, and that’s true - but only for a while. It may be bliss not to know a tornadois coming because you have no need to worry or take action. But while your head is inthe sand your bum is in the air, the tornado is still coming.If you looked up and faced it, disaster could beavoided, but ignorance and denial always ensure thatyou will get the full force and the most extremeconsequences, because it strikes when least expectedand you are least prepared. Like I say, ignorance isbliss - but only for so long. We create our ownreality by our thoughts and actions. For every actionor non-action there is a consequence. When we giveour minds and our responsibility away, we give ourlives away. If enough of us do it, we give the worldaway and that is precisely what we have been doingthroughout known human history. This is why thefew have always controlled the masses. The onlydifference today is that the few are nowmanipulating the entire planet because of the globalisation of business, banking andcommunications. The foundation of that control has always been the same: keep thepeople in ignorance, fear and at war with themselves. Divide, rule and conquer whilekeeping the most important knowledge to yourself (see Figure 1). And as we shall see inthis book, those who have used these methods to control humanity for thousands of yearsare members of the same force, the same interbreeding tribe, following a long termAgenda which is now reaching a major point on its journey. The global fascist state isupon us.And yet, it doesn’t have to be like this. The real power is with the many, not the few.Indeed infinite power is within every individual. The reason we are so controlled is notFigure 1: Knowledge is in the hands of thefew and the rest are kept ignorant.

When something happens that we don’t like, we lookfor someone else to blame. When there is a problem in the world, we say “What arethey going to do about it”. At which point they, who have secretly created the problemin the first place, respond to this demand by introducing a ‘solution’ - morecentralisation of power and erosion of freedom. If you want to give more powers to thepolice, security agencies and military, and you want the public to demand you do it,then ensure there is more crime, violence and terrorism, and then it’s a cinch to achieveyour aims. Once the people are in fear of being burgled, mugged or bombed, they willdemand that you take their freedom away to protect them from what they have beenmanipulated to fear. The Oklahoma bombing is a classic of this kind, as I detail in ..And The Truth Shall Set You Free. I call this technique problem-reaction-solution.Create the problem, encourage the reaction “something must be done”, and then offerthe solution. It is summed up by the Freemason motto ‘Ordo Ab Chao’ - order out ofchaos. Create the chaos and then offer the way to restore order. Your order.The masses are herded and directed by many and various forms of emotional andmental control. It is the only way it could be done. The few can’t control billions ofpeople physically, just as farm animals cannot be controlled physically unless a largenumber of people are involved. Two pigs escaped from a slaughterhouse in Englandand eluded capture for so long, despite the efforts of many people to catch them, thatthey became national celebrities. Physical control of the global population cannotwork. But it is not necessary when you can manipulate the way people think and feel tothe point where they ‘decide’ to do what you want them to do anyway and demand thatyou introduce laws that you want to introduce. It is an old, old adage that if you wantsomeone to do something, get them to believe it is their idea.’ Humanity is mindcontrolled and only slightly more conscious than your average zombie. Far fetched?No, no.1 define mind control as the manipulation of someone’s mind so that they think,and therefore act, the way you want them to. Under this definition, the question is nothow many people are mind controlled, but how few are not. Everyone is to a larger orlesser extent. When you are persuaded by advertising or hype to buy something youdon’t really need or want, you are being mind controlled. When you read or hear aslanted news story and allow it to affect your perception of a person or event, you arebeing mind controlled. Look at the training for the armed forces. It is pure mindcontrol. From day one you are told to take orders without question and if some berk ina peaked cap tells you to shoot people you have never met and know nothing about,you must shoot without question. This is the “Yes sir!” mentality and it pervades thenon-military world, also. “Well, I know it’s not right, but the boss told me to do it and Ihad no choice.” No choice? We never have no choice. We have choices we would liketo make and choices we would rather less like to make. But we never have no choice.To say so is another cop out.The list of mind manipulating techniques is endless. They want your mind becausewhen they have that, they have you. The answer lies in taking our minds back, thinkingxii"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"for ourselves and allowing others to do the same without fear of ridicule orcondemnation for the crime of being different. If we don’t do that, the Agenda I amgoing to outline will be implemented. But if we do regain control of our minds andachieve mental sovereignty, the Agenda cannot happen because the foundation of itsexistence will have been taken away. I’ve talked and researched in more than 20countries and I see the same process in every one of them. Identical policies andstructures are introduced in line with a Global Agenda, yet at the same time there is quiteobviously a global awakening as more and more people hear the spiritual alarm clock andemerge from their mental and emotional slumbers, the terrestrial trance. Which force willprevail in these Millennium years to 2012? That is up to us. We create our own reality byour thoughts and actions. If we change our thoughts and actions we will change theworld. It’s that simple.In this book I am going to chart the history of the interbreeding tribe of bloodlineswhich control the world today and reveal the true nature of the Global Agenda. And Iwould emphasise that I am exposing an Agenda, not a conspiracy as such. The conspiracycomes in manipulating people and events to ensure the Agenda is introduced. Theseconspiracies take three main forms: conspiring to remove people and organisations thatare a threat to the Agenda (the assassination of Diana, Princess of Wales); conspiring toput people into positions of power who will make the Agenda happen (George Bush,Henry Kissinger, Tony Blair, et at); and conspiring to create events which will make thepublic demand the Agenda is introduced through problem-reaction-solution (wars,terrorist bombs, economic collapses). In this way all these apparently unconnected eventsand manipulations become aspects of the same conspiracy to introduce the same Agenda.In the months and years that follow, every time you pick up a paper, turn on thetelevision or hear a speech from a political or business leader, you are going to see theinformation outlined here coming to pass. You already can if you understand the scam.Look at my previous books like .. And The Truth Shall Set You Free, I Am Me I Am Free,The Robots’ Rebellion, the video Turning Of The Tide, and the work of other researchersover decades and you will see that what was predicted is happening. This is not prophecy,it is merely the prior knowledge of the Agenda. So will the global fascist state be realisedin the next few years? That question can only be answered by another: are we going tobecome people or continue as sheeple?The Agenda depends on the latter.xiii"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"WARNINGThere is an enormous amount of challenging information inthis book.

I could have held back information which isstunningly bizarre, but true. This would be the easy way, staying within the comfortzone and communicating only that which would not challenge too many people’s senseof possibility.Or I could treat the readers like fully formed, fully connected, multidimensional,adult human beings and communicate all the relevant information, including somewhich will stretch their sense of reality to breaking point. As always, I have chosen thelatter. It is not for me to edit information for the readers, it is for the readers to edit theinformation for themselves. How arrogant and patronising to think that I should keepinformation back from people because “they’re not ready for it”. Who am I to decidethat? And how can I know if they are “ready for it” unless they hear it and can thereforedecide for themselves? Some of my friends have urged me to tell people the basic story,but “for Cod’s sake don’t mention the reptiles”. You will see what they mean by thatvery shortly. I understand their concern, but I can only be myself. And I have to tell allthat I know and not only that which maintains the comfort zone. That’s just me, the wayI am. Of course the theme of the book will attract ridicule from those with a vision ofpossibility the size of a pea and, naturally, from those who know it to be true and don’twant the public to believe it. But so what? Who cares? I don’t. As Candhi said: “Even ifyou are in a minority of one, the truth is still the truth.” So here’s the story, punchesunpulled.In summary, a race of interbreeding bloodlines, a race within a race in fact, werecentred in the Middle and Near East in the ancient world and, over the thousands ofyears since, have expanded their power across the globe. A crucial aspect of this hasbeen to create a network of mystery schools and secret societies to covertly introducetheir Agenda while, at the same time, creating institutions like religions to mentally andemotionally imprison the masses and set them at war with each other. The hierarchy ofthis tribe of bloodlines is not exclusively male and some of its key positions are held bywomen. But in terms of numbers it is overwhelmingly male and I will therefore refer tothis group as the Brotherhood. Even more accurately, given the importance of ancientBabylon to this story, I will also call it the Babylonian Brotherhood. The plan they termtheir ‘Creat Work of Ages’, I will call the Brotherhood Agenda. The present magnitudeof Brotherhood control did not happen in a few years, even a few decades or centuries:it can be traced back thousands of years. The structures of today’s institutions in"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"2government, banking, business, military and the media have not been infiltrated by thisforce, they were created by them from the start. The Brotherhood Agenda is, in truth,the Agenda of many Millennia. It is the unfolding of a plan, piece by piece, for thecentralised control of the planet.The bloodline hierarchy at the top of the human pyramid of control and suppressionpasses the baton across the generations, mostly sons following fathers. The children ofthese family lines who are chosen to inherit the baton are brought up from birth tounderstand the Agenda and the methods of manipulating the ‘Great Work’ into reality.Advancing the Agenda becomes their indoctrinated mission from very early in theirlives. By the time their turn comes to join the Brotherhood hierarchy and carry thebaton into the next generation, their upbringing has moulded them into highlyimbalanced people. They are intellectually very sharp, but with a compassion bypassand an arrogance that they have the right to rule the world and control the ignorantmasses who they view as inferior. Any Brotherhood children who threaten to challengeor reject that mould are pushed aside or dealt with in other ways to ensure that only‘safe’ people make it to the upper levels of the pyramid and the highly secret andadvanced knowledge that is held there. Some of these bloodlines can be named. TheBritish House of Windsor is one of them, so are the Rothschilds, the European royaltyand aristocracy, the Rockefellers, and the rest of the so-called Eastern Establishment ofthe United States which produces the American presidents, business leaders, bankersand administrators. But at the very top, the cabal which controls the human raceoperates from the shadows outside the public domain. Any group which is soimbalanced as to covet the complete control of the planet will be warring within itselfas different factions seek the ultimate control. This is certainly true of the Brotherhood.There is tremendous internal strife, conflict and competition. One researcher describedthem as a gang of bank robbers who all agree on the job, but then argue over how thespoils will be divided. That is an excellent description and through history differentfactions have gone to war with each other for dominance. In the end, however, they areunited in their desire to see the plan implemented and at the key moments theyoverwhelmingly join forces to advance the Agenda when it comes under challenge.You will probably have to go back hundreds of thousands of years to find thestarting point of this story of human manipulation and of the family lines whichorchestrate the Great Work. The more I have researched this over the years, the moreobvious it has become to me that the origin of the bloodlines and the plan for thetakeover of the Earth goes off planet to a race or races from other spheres or dimensionsof evolution. Extraterrestrial as we call them. If you doubt the existence ofextraterrestrial life then consider this for a moment. Our Sun is only one of some 100billion stars in this galaxy alone. Sir Francis Crick, the Nobel laureate, says there are anestimated 100 billion galaxies in our universe and he believes there are at least onemillion planets in our galaxy that could support life as we know it. Think of what thefigure might be for the entire universe, even before we start looking at other dimensionsof existence beyond the frequency range of our physical senses. If you travelled at the"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"3speed of light, 186,000 miles per second, it would take you 4.3 years to reach thenearest star to this solar system. It says much for humanity’s level of indoctrination thatto speak of extraterrestrial life is to appear cranky, yet to dismiss it and suggest that lifehas only emerged on this one tiny planet is considered credible! You only have toconsider the amazing structures that abounded in the ancient world to see that anadvanced race existed then. We are told that only people primitive in comparison tomodern humans lived in these times, but that is patently ludicrous. Like most official‘thinking’ the historical and archaeological establishment makes up its own stories,calls them proven facts, and simply ignores the overwhelming evidence that they arewrong. The idea is not to educate, but to indoctrinate. Anyone who doesn’t conform tothe official line of history is isolated by their fellow historians and archaeologists whoeither know their jobs, reputations and funding are safer when they stick to the officialversion, or, frankly, they cannot see beyond the end of their noses. The same can be saidof most people in the teaching and ‘intellectual’ professions.All over the planet are fantastic structures built thousands of years ago which couldonly have been created with technology as good as, often even better than, we havetoday. At Baalbek, north east of Beirut in the Lebanon, three massive chunks of stone,each weighing 800 tons, were moved at least a third of a mile and positioned high up ina wall. This was done thousands of years BC! Another block nearby weighs 1,000 tons- the weight of three jumbo jets. How was this possible? Official history does not wishto address such questions because of where it might lead. Can you imagine ringing abuilder today and asking him to do that? “You want me to do WHAT?” he would say,“You’re crazy.” In Peru are the mysterious Nazca Lines. The ancients scored away thetop surface of the land to reveal the white subsurface and through this method werecreated incredible depictions of animals, fish, insects and birds. Some of them are solarge they can only be seen in their entirety from 1,000 feet in the air! The knowledgewhich allowed wonders like Nazca, Baalbek, the Great Pyramid at Giza and otheramazing creations to be built with such precision and scale, came from an advancedrace who, in ancient times, lived among a far more primitive general population. Thisrace is described as ‘the gods’ in the Old Testament texts and other works and in oraltraditions of antiquity. I can hear followers of the Bible denying that their book speaksof ‘the gods’. But it does. When the word ‘God’ is used in the Old Testament it is oftentranslated from a word that means gods, plural - Elohim and Adonai are two examples.You can easily understand that a race performing technological feats of such magnitudeshould be seen as ‘gods’ by a people unable to comprehend such abilities. In the 1930s,American and Australian servicemen landed their planes in remote parts of New Guineato drop supplies for their troops. The locals, who had never seen a plane, believed theservicemen were gods and they became a focus of religious beliefs. This would havebeen even more extreme in the ancient world had their advanced race been beings fromother planets, stars or dimensions, flying craft more advanced than anything flown (atleast officially!) by today’s military. An influx of knowledge from outside this planet oranother source would explain so many of the ‘mysteries’ that official history greets with"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"4a deafening silence. The incredible feats of building also become explainable and sodoes the mystery of why early civilisations like Egypt and Sumer (the land of Shinar inthe Bible) began at the peak of their development and then fell into decay, when thenormal course of evolution is to start at a lower level and slowly advance throughlearning and experience. There was clearly an infusion of highly advanced knowledgethat was later lost to most people. In every culture throughout the world are ancientstories and texts which describe the ‘gods’ who brought this advanced knowledge. Thiswould again explain the mystery of how the ancients had a phenomenal understandingof astronomy. There are endless legends all over the world of a time they call theGolden Age, which was destroyed by cataclysm and the ‘fall of Man’. The ancientGreek poet, Heslod, described the world before the ‘fall’:“Man lived like Gods, without vices or passions, vexation or toil. In happy companionshipwith divine beings (extraterrestrials?), they passed their days in tranquillity and joy, livingtogether in perfect equality, united by mutual confidence and love. The Earth was morebeautiful than now, and spontaneously yielded an abundant variety of fruits. Human beingsand animals spoke the same language and conversed with each other (telepathy). Menwere considered mere boys at a hundred years old. They had none of the infirmities of ageto trouble them and when they passed to regions of superior life, it was in a gentleslumber.” 1Utopian as that may sound, there are countless stories from every ancient culturewhich describe the world in the distant past in those terms. We can recreate that visionagain if only we change the way we think and feel. The most comprehensive accountsof an advanced race are contained in tens of thousands of clay tablets found in 1850about 250 miles from Baghdad, Iraq, by an Englishman Sir Austen Henry Layard as heexcavated the site of Nineveh, the capital of Assyria. This was located near the presentIraqi town of Mosul. Other finds have followed in this region which was once calledMesopotamia. The original source of this knowledge was not the Assyrians, but theSumerians who lived in the same area from, it is estimated, 4,000 to 2,000 BC. I willrefer to the clay tablets, therefore, as the Sumerian Texts or Tablets. They are one of thegreatest historical finds imaginable and yet 150 years after they were discovered theyare still ignored by conventional history and education. Why? Because they demolishthe official version of events. The most famous translator of these tablets is the scholarand author Zecharia Sitchin, who can read Sumerian, Aramaic, Hebrew and otherMiddle and Near Eastern languages.2 He has extensively researched and translated theSumerian Tablets and has no doubt that they are describing extraterrestrials. Someresearchers say that he used a later version of the Sumerian language to translate anearlier one and, therefore, some of his translations may not be 100% accurate. I thinkhis themes are correct, indeed other accounts and evidence supports this, but Ipersonally doubt some of the detail. I think that a number of Sitchin’s interpretations areextremely questionable, while I agree with the overall thesis. According to his"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"5translations (and others) theTexts say that the Sumeriancivilisation, from whichmany features of modernsociety derive, was a “giftfrom the gods”. Not mythicalgods, but physical ones wholived among them. TheTablets call these gods theAN.UNNAK.KI (Those whofrom Heaven to Earth came),and DIN.GIR (The RighteousOnes of the BlazingRockets). The name ofSumer itself was KI.EN.GIR (The Land of the Lord of the Blazing Rockets and alsoLand of the Watchers, according to Sitchin). The ancient text known as the Book ofEnoch also calls the gods ‘the Watchers’, as did the Egyptians. The Egyptian name fortheir gods, the Neteru, literally translates as Watchers and they said that their gods camein heavenly boats.According to Zecharia Sitchin, the tablets describe how the Anunnaki came from aplanet called Nibiru (The Planet of the Crossing) which he believes has a 3,600 yearelliptical orbit that takes it between Jupiter and Mars and then out into far space beyondPluto. Modern science has identified a body it calls Planet X which has been locatedbeyond Pluto and is believed to be part of this solar system. But an elliptical orbitwould be incredibly unstable and difficult to sustain. Scientists I trust believe thatSitchin is mistaken in his Nibiru theory, though his main themes about the Anunnaki arecorrect. The Sumerian Tablets, from Sitchin’s translations, describe how, during theearly formation of the solar system, Nibiru caused the near destruction of a planet thatonce existed between Jupiter and Mars. The Sumerians called it Tiamat, a planet theynicknamed The Watery Monster. They say that it was debris from Tiamat’s collisionwith a Nibiru moon which created the Great Band Bracelet - the asteroid belt which isfound between Mars and Jupiter. What remained of Tiamat was thrown into anotherorbit, the texts say, and eventually it became the Earth (see Figure 2). The Sumerianname for the Earth means the Cleaved One because a vast hole was created, they say,by the collision. Interestingly if you take away the water in the Pacific Ocean you willbe left with a gigantic hole.Figure 2: The solar system showingthe location of the asteroid beltbetween Mars and Jupiter which,though the details vary, many ancientand modern accounts suggest is theremains of a planet or part of aplanet."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"6The Tablets are the written accounts of oral traditions that go back enormousamounts of time and you have to be careful that details have not been added or lost andthat we don’t take symbolism or parable as literal truth. I am sure that some confusiondid occur in this way. I have doubts myself about the Nibiru-Tiamat scenario and itsalleged timescale. But there is much truth in the Texts which can be proven, not least intheir knowledge of astronomy. The Tablets depict the solar system with the planets intheir correct positions, orbits and relative sizes, and their accuracy has only beenconfirmed in the last 150 years since some of these planets have been found. TheTablets describe the nature and colour of Neptune and Uranus in ways that have onlybeen confirmed in the last few years! What’s more, the modern ‘experts’ did not expectthose planets to look as they did, yet the Sumerians knew thousands of years BC whatour ‘advanced’ science has only just discovered.Most stunning about the Sumerian Tablets is the way they describe the creation ofhomo sapiens. Sitchin says the Anunnaki came to the Earth an estimated 450,000 yearsago to mine gold in what is now Africa. The main mining centre was in today’sZimbabwe, an area the Sumerians called AB.ZU (deep deposit), he claims. Studies bythe Anglo-American Corporation have found extensive evidence of gold mining inAfrica at least 60,000 years ago, probably 100,000.3 The gold mined by the Anunnakiwas shipped back to their home planet from bases in the Middle East, Sitchin claims theTablets say. I think there is much more to know about this ‘gold mining’ business, and Idon’t believe that was the main reason they came here, if indeed it was a reason at all.At first the gold mining was done by the Anunnaki version of their working classes,Sitchin says, but eventually there was a rebellion by the miners and the Anunnaki royalelite decided to create a new slave race to do the work. The Tablets describe how thegenes of the Annunaki and those of the native humans were combined in a test tube tocreate the ‘updated’ human capable of doing the tasks the Anunnaki required. The ideaof test tube babies would have sounded ridiculous when the tablets were found in 1850,but that is precisely what scientists are now able to do. Again and again modernresearch supports the themes of the Sumerian Tablets. For instance, there was a suddenand so far unexplained upgrade of the human physical form around 200,000 years ago.Official science is silent on the cause of this and mutters terms like ‘the missing link’.But some unavoidable facts need to be addressed. Suddenly the previous physical formknown as homo erectus became what we now call homo sapiens. From the start the newhomo sapiens had the ability to speak a complex language and the size of the humanbrain increased massively. Yet the biologist Thomas Huxley said that major changeslike this can take tens of millions of years. This view is supported by the evidence ofhomo erectus which appears to have emerged in Africa about 1.5 million years ago. Forwell in excess of a million years their physical form seems to have remained the same,but then, out of nowhere, came the dramatic change to homo sapiens. About 35,000years ago came another sudden upgrade and the emergence of homo sapiens sapiens,the physical form we see today. The Sumerian Tablets name the two people involved inthe creation of the slave race. They were the chief scientist called Enki, Lord of the"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"7Earth (Ki=Earth) and Ninkharsag, also known as Ninti (Lady Life) because of herexpertise in medicine. She was later referred to as Mammi, from which comes mamaand mother. Ninkharsag is symbolised in Mesopotamian depictions by a tool used to cutthe umbilical cord. It is shaped like a horseshoe and was used in ancient times. She alsobecame the mother goddess of a stream of religions under names like Queen Semiramis,Isis, Barati, Diana, Mary and many others, which emerged from the legends of this allover the world. She is often depicted as a pregnant woman. The texts say of theAnunnaki leadership:They summoned and asked the goddess,the midwife of the gods, the wise birthgiver (saying),“To a creature give life, create workers!Create a primitive worker, that he may bear the yoke!Let him bear the yoke assigned by Enlil,Let the worker carry the toil of the gods!” 4Enlil was commander of the Anunnaki and Enki was his half-brother. Enki andNinkharsag had many failures as they sought the right genetic mix, the Tablets tell us.There are accounts of how they created people with major defects and also human-animal hybrids. Horrible stuff, and exactly what is claimed to be happening today in theextraterrestrial-human underground bases around the world. The story of Frankenstein,the man created in a laboratory, could be symbolic of these events. It was written byMary Shelley, the wife of the famous poet. He and she were high initiates of the secretsociety network which has hoarded and suppressed this knowledge since ancient times.The Tablets say that Enki and Ninkharsag eventually found the right mix which becamethe first homo sapiens, a being the Sumerians called a LU.LU (One who has beenmixed). This is the biblical ‘Adam’. LU.LU was a genetic hybrid, the fusing of homoerectus with the genes of the ‘gods’ to create a slave, a human worker bee, some200,000-300,000 years ago. A female version was also created. The Sumerian name forhuman was LU, the root meaning of which is worker or servant, and it was also used toimply domesticated animals. This is what the human race has been ever since. TheAnunnaki have been overtly and now covertly ruling the planet for thousands of years.The mistranslation of the Bible and symbolic language taken literally has devastated theoriginal meaning and given us a fantasy story. Genesis and Exodus were written by theHebrew priestly class, the Levites, after they were taken to Babylon from around 586BC. Babylon was in the former lands of Sumer and so the Babylonians, and thereforethe Levites, knew the Sumerian stories and accounts. It was from these recordsoverwhelmingly, that the Levites compiled Genesis and Exodus. The source is obvious.The Sumerian tablets speak of E.DIN (The Abode of the Righteous Ones). Thisconnects with the Sumerian name for their gods, DIN.GIR (the Righteous Ones of theRockets). So the Sumerians spoke of Edin and Genesis speaks of the Garden of Eden.This was a centre for the gods, the Anunnaki. The Sumerian Tablets speak of King"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"8Sargon the Elder being found as a baby floating in a basket on the river and brought upby a royal family. Exodus speaks of Moses being found as a baby floating in a basketon the river by a royal princess and how he was brought up by the Egyptian royalfamily. The list of such ‘coincidences’ goes on and on.The Old Testament is a classic example of the religious recycling which has spawnedall the religions. So when you are looking for the original meaning of Genesis and thestory of Adam you have to go back to the Sumerian accounts to see how the story hasbeen doctored. Genesis says that ‘God’ (the gods) created the first man, Adam, out of‘dust from the ground’ and then used a rib of Adam to create Eve, the first woman.Zecharia Sitchin points out that the translation of ‘dust from the ground’ comes from theHebrew word tit (sorry mother) and this itself is derived from the Sumerian term, TI.IT,which means ‘that which is with life’. Adam was not created from dust from the ground,but from that which is with life - living cells. The Sumerian term, TI, means both rib andlife and again the translators made the wrong choice. Eve (She Who Has Life) was notcreated from a rib, but from that which has life - living cells. The human egg for thecreation of the Lulu/Adam came from a female in Abzu, Africa, according to theSumerians, and modern fossil finds and anthropological research suggests that homosapiens did indeed come out of Africa. In the 1980s, Douglas Wallace of EmoryUniversity in Georgia compared the DNA (the blueprint for physical life) of 800 womenand concluded that it came from a single female ancestor.5 Wesley Brown of theUniversity of Michigan said, after examining the DNA of 21 women of different geneticbackgrounds from around the world, that they all originated from a single source whohad lived in Africa between 180,000 and 300,000 years ago.6 Rebecca Cann of theUniversity of California at Berkeley did the same with 147 women of diverse racial andgeographical backgrounds and she said their common genetic inheritance came from asingle ancestor between 150,000 and 300,000 years ago.7 Another study of 150American women from genetic lines going back to Europe, Africa and the Middle East,together with Aborigines from Australia and New Guinea, concluded that they had thesame female ancestor who lived in Africa between 140,000 and 290,000 years ago.8Personally I think the human race was seeded by many sources; not just the Annunaki.The Sumerian Tablets and later Akkadian stories give the names and hierarchy ofthe Anunnaki. They call the ‘Father’ of the gods, AN, a word that means heaven.Our Father who art in heaven? AN, or Anu to the Akkadians, stayed mostly inheaven with his wife, Antu, and he made only rare visits to the planet they calledE.RI.DU (Home in the faraway built), a word which evolved into Earth. Or at leastthat is the Zecharia Sitchin translation. The descriptions could also imply that Anustayed mostly in the high mountains of the Near East where the ‘Garden of Eden’,the place of the gods, is reckoned on good evidence to have been, and he made onlyrare visits to the plains of Sumer. A Sumerian city was called Eridu. Anu sent twosons to develop and rule the Earth, the Tablets say. They were Enki, the guy theysay created homo sapiens, and his half-brother Enlil. These two would later becomegreat rivals for ultimate control of the planet. Enki, the first born of Anu, was"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"9subordinate to Enlil because of the Anunnaki’s obsession with genetic purity. Enlil’smother was the half sister to Anu and this union passed on the male genes moreefficiently than Enki’s birth via another mother. Later the Tablets describe how theAnunnaki created bloodlines to rule humanity on their behalf and these, I suggest, arethe families still in control of the world to this day. The Sumerian Tablets describe howkingship was granted to humanity by the Anunnaki and it was originally known as Anu-ship after An or Anu, the ruler of the ‘gods’. The Brotherhood families are obsessedwith bloodlines and genetic inheritance and they interbreed without regard for love. Theroyal families (family!) and aristocracy of Europe and the so-called EasternEstablishment families in the United States are obvious examples of this. They are ofthe same tribe and genetically related. This is why the Brotherhood families havealways been obsessed with interbreeding, just as the Sumerian Tablets describe theAnunnaki. They are not interbreeding through snobbery, but to hold a genetic structurewhich gives them certain abilities, especially the ability to ‘shape-shift’ and manifest inother forms. I’ll come to this in more detail shortly.The Tablets describe how humans were given the ability to procreate by Enki andthis led to an explosion in the human population which threatened to swamp theAnunnaki, who were never great in number. The Anunnaki had many internal conflictsand high-tech wars with each other, as the Enlil and Enki factions fought for control. Itis generally accepted by researchers of the Anunnaki that Enki is on humanity’s side,but it seems to me that both groups desire dominance over this planet, and that is theirreal motivatation. As Zecharia Sitchin documents in his translations, and readers of theIndian holy books, the Vedas, will confirm, there were many accounts of the ‘gods’going to war with each other as they battled for supremacy. The Sumerian accountsdescribe how the sons of the Annunaki ‘gods’ were most involved in these wars. Thesewere the offspring of Enki and Enlil, the half-brothers who became fierce rivals, andtheir sons played out that battle in a high-tech conflict, the Tablets say. One battle theyappeared to have been involved in was the biblical destruction of Sodom andGomorrah. These cities were probably located at the southern end of the Dead Seawhere, today, radiation readings are much higher than normal. This was when,according to the Bible, Lot’s wife looked back and was turned into a pillar of salt. Afterreferring to the original Sumerian, Zecharia Sitchin says that the true translation of thatpassage should read that Lot’s wife was turned into a pillar of vapour which, onbalance, is rather more likely!All over the world in every native culture you will find stories of a Great Flood and theSumerian Tablets are no different. Sitchin says they tell how the Anunnaki left the planetin flying craft, as an enormous surge of water wiped out much of humanity. There is nodoubt that an unimaginable catastrophe, or more likely catastrophes, were visited upon theEarth between approximately 11,000 and 4,000 BC. The geological and biologicalevidence is overwhelming in its support of the countless stories and traditions whichdescribe such events. They come from Europe, Scandinavia, Russia, Africa, throughoutthe American continent, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, China, Japan and the Middle East."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"10Everywhere. Some speak of great heat which boiled the sea; of mountains breathingfire; the disappearance of the Sun and Moon and the darkness that followed; the rainingdown of blood, ice and rock; the Earth flipping over; the sky falling; the rising andsinking of land; the loss of a great continent; the coming of the ice; and virtually all ofthem describe a fantastic flood, a wall of water, which swept across the Earth. The tidalwave caused by the comet in the film, Deep Impact, gives you an idea of what it wouldhave been like. Old Chinese texts describe how the pillars supporting the sky crumbled;of how the Sun, Moon and stars poured down in the north-west, where the sky becamelow; rivers, seas and oceans rushed to the south-east where the Earth sank and a greatconflagration was quenched by a raging flood. In America, the Pawnee Indians tell thesame story of a time when the north and south polar stars changed places and went tovisit each other. North American traditions refer to great clouds appearing and a heat sopowerful that the waters boiled. The Greenland Eskimos told early missionaries thatlong ago the Earth turned over. Peruvian legend says that the Andes were split apartwhen the sky made war with the Earth. Brazilian myth describes how the heavens burstand fragments fell down killing everything and everyone as heaven and Earth changedplaces. And the Hopi Indians of North America record that: “the Earth was rent in greatchasms, and water covered everything except one narrow ridge of mud”.9All of this closely correlates with the legends of Atlantis and Mu or Lemuria: twovast continents, one in the Atlantic and the other in the Pacific, which many peoplebelieve were ruled by highly advanced races. The continents are said to havedisappeared under the sea in the circumstances described above, leaving only islandslike the Azores as remnants of their former scale and glory. Atlantis was described byPlato (427-347 BC), the ancient Greek philosopher and high initiate of the secretsociety-mystery school network. To this day this secret network has passed on muchknowledge to the chosen few while denying that privilege to the mass of the people.Official history dismisses Plato’s contention that such a continent existed and there areapparent historical discrepancies in his accounts, but there is geological support for hisbasic theme. The Azores, which some believe were part of Atlantis, lie on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge which is connected to a fracture line that encircles the planet (see Figure3). This line continues for a distance of 40,000 miles. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is one ofthe foremost areas for earthquakes and volcanoes. Four vast tectonic plates, theEurasian, African, North American and Caribbean, all meet and collide in this regionmaking it very unstable geologically. Both the Azores and the Canary Islands (namedafter dogs ‘canine’ and not canaries!), were subject to widespread volcanic activity inthe time period Plato suggested for the end of Atlantis. Tachylite lava disintegrates insea water within 15,000 years and yet it is still found on the sea bed around the Azores,confirming geologically-recent upheavals.10 Other evidence, including beach sandgathered from depths of 10,500-18,440 feet, reveals that the seabed in this region musthave been, again geologically-recently, above sea level.11 The oceanographer, MauriceEwing, wrote in National Geographic magazine that: “Either the land must have sunktwo or three miles, or the sea must once have been two or three miles lower than now."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"11Either conclusion is startling.“12The geological and biological evidence also suggests that the widespread volcanicactivity which caused the sinking of the land in the region of the Azores, happened atthe same time as the break up and sinking of the land mass known as Appalachia whichconnected what we now call Europe, North America, Iceland and Greenland.13 Eventheir degree of submergence appear closely related. Similar evidence can be producedto support the view that the continent known as Mu or Lemuria now rests on the bed ofthe Pacific.14 The so-called Bermuda Triangle between Bermuda, southern Florida, anda point near the Antilles, has long been associated with Atlantis. It is also an areasteeped in legends of disappearing ships and aircraft. Submerged buildings, walls, roadsand stone circles like Stonehenge, even what appear to be pyramids, have been locatednear Bimini, under the waters of the Bahama Banks and within the ‘triangle’.15 So havewalls or roads creating intersecting lines.16 Some other facts that most people don’tknow: the Himalayas, the Alps and the Andes, only reached anything like their presentheight around 11,000 years ago.17 Lake Titicaca on the Peru-Bolivia border is today thehighest navigable lake in the world at some 12,500 feet. Around 11,000 years ago,much of that region was at sea level! Why are so many fish and other ocean fossilsfound high up in mountain ranges? Because those mountains were once at sea level.Recently so in geological terms, too. There is increasing acceptance that the Earth hassuffered some colossal geological upheavals. The debate (and often hostility) comesFigure 3: The Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the centre of earthquake and volcanic activity in the area of the AtlanticOcean where Plato apparently placed Atlantis."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"12with the questions of when and why. These upheavals have obviously involved the solarsystem as a whole because every planet shows evidence of some cataclysmic eventswhich have affected either its surface, atmosphere, speed and angle of orbit or rotation.I think the themes of the Sumerian Tablets are correct, but I doubt some of their detail,not least because of the vast period that passed between 450,000 years ago when theAnunnaki are said to have arrived, and the time, only a few thousand years ago, whenthese accounts were written down. There was certainly an enormous cataclysm on theEarth around 11,000 BC which destroyed the advanced civilisations of the high-techGolden Age and that date of 13,000 years ago is highly significant and very relevant tothe time we are living through now. Just as the planets of the solar system revolvearound the Sun, so the solar system revolves around the centre of the galaxy, or this partof it at least. This ‘central sun’ or galactic sun, is sometimes referred to as the BlackSun. It takes about 26,000 years for the solar system to complete a circuit of the galacticcentre and this is known in the Indian culture as a yuga. For half of that 26,000 yearsthe Earth is tilted towards the Black Sun, the light source, and for the second 13,000years it is tilted away, some researchers believe. These cycles are therefore verydifferent as the planet is bathed in positive light for 13,000 years and then moves intothe ‘darkness’ for the next 13,000. This fundamentally affects the energy in which weall live. Interestingly, it was 13,000 years ago that the Golden Age would appear to haveconcluded in cataclysm and conflict, and today, with the 13,000 year cycle of ‘darkness’reaching its conclusion, there is a rapid global spiritual awakening and incredible eventsawait us in the next few years. We are entering the light again. So there was a fantasticcataclysm around 13,000 years ago which brought an end to the high-tech civilisationsof the Golden Age. But was it the only one? The evidence suggests not.A friend of mine in California, Brian Desborough, is a researcher and scientist Ihave great respect for. He has been involved in aerospace research and has beenemployed in this and other scientific research by many companies. Brian is a feet-on-the-ground guy who looks at all the evidence and goes where it, rather thanconvention, takes him. He has compiled some highly detailed and compellinginformation about the ancient world and its connection to the Brotherhoodmanipulation of today. While he worked for a major United States corporation inthe 1960s, their physicists completed their own independent studies whichsuggested that about 4,800 BC a huge body, which we now know as Jupiter,careered into our solar system. The outer planets were thrown into disarray andJupiter eventually crashed into a planet which orbited between the present Jupiterand Mars. The physicists said the remains of this planet became the asteroid beltand that part of Jupiter broke away to become what we now call Venus. As Venus,then a vast chunk of matter, was projected into space, it destroyed the atmosphereand life of Mars before it was caught by the Earth’s gravitational field, the studyclaimed. Venus made several orbits of the Earth before its momentum hurled it intoits current position in the solar system. It was those orbits, the physicists said, thatbrought devastation and a tidal wave about 4,800 BC. They believed, as Brian"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"13Desborough does, that before this time Mars orbited where the Earth is now and theEarth was much closer to the Sun. The brilliant light of Venus as it passed close to theEarth may have led to the idea of Lucifer, the ‘light bringer’. The most ancientMesopotamian and Central American records do not include Venus in their planetaryaccounts, only later does it appear. There was an obsession with Venus in manycultures, with human sacrifices being made to it.The unofficial study by the physicists has never been published, but let us considerthe evidence for some of its claims. When you sprinkle particles on a vibrating plateyou can recreate the planetary orbits of the solar system. When vibratory waves movingoutward from the plate’s centre meet waves moving in the other direction, a so-calledstanding wave is formed as the two collide. This causes the particles to build up andcreate a series of concentric circles. These will be equally spaced if single frequenciescollide with each other, but if, as with the solar system, a spectrum of frequencies areinvolved, the circles will be unequally spaced in accordance with the vibrationalpressures. Place an object on these vibrating circles of particles and it will begin to orbitthe centre of the plate, carried by the energy flow caused by the vibrational interactions.Heavier objects placed anywhere on the plate will be drawn to one of these concentriccircles and these objects will themselves form wave patterns around themselves whichwill attract lighter objects to them. In our solar system, the most powerful waves arebeing emitted from the centre by the Sun, obviously, because that represents 99% of thematter in the solar system. These waves from the Sun interact with other cosmic waves,so forming a series of standing waves which, in turn, form concentric circles orvibrational fields orbiting the Sun. The heaviest bodies, the planets, are caught in thesecircles and thus orbit the Sun. The planets also create less powerful wave circles aroundthemselves and these can attract lighter bodies which orbit them. The Moon orbiting theEarth is an example of this. So anything that would disturb this harmony of vibrationalinteraction would affect these concentric circles of energy and, if this was powerfulenough, change the orbit of planets. What the physicists say happened with Jupiter andVenus would certainly be powerful enough to do this. These circles of standing wavesexist around the Sun in relation to the vibrational pressures involved and they do notneed a planet to exist. They exist anyway and a planetary body merely locks into them.Therefore there are many more of these vibrational ‘roadways’ in the solar system thanthere are planets, and if a planet or body is ejected from its orbit it will eventually lockinto another wave, another orbit, when its momentum slows enough to be captured. This,Desborough believes, is what happened when the fantastic vibrational pressures of theVenus ‘comet’ passed close to Mars and the Earth and hurled them into different orbits.Venus would have been an ice-coated ‘comet’, Desborough says, and the ice wouldhave disintegrated when Venus approached the Earth and reached a point known as theRoche Limit.18 This is a vibrational safety device, if you like. When two bodies are oncollision course, the one with the smallest mass starts to disintegrate at the Roche Limit.In this case, the ice would have been projected from Venus’s surface towards the Earth.Also, as it entered the so-called Van Allen Belt, which absorbs much of the dangerous"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"14radiation from the Sun, the ice would have been ionised - magnetised - and thereforeattracted to the Earth’s magnetic poles.19 Billions of tons of ice, cooled to -273 degreescentigrade, would have fallen on the polar regions, flash-freezing everything in littlemore than an instant.20 This, at last, would explain the mystery of the mammoths foundfrozen where they stood. The mammoth, contrary to belief, was not a cold regionanimal, but one which lived in temperate grasslands. Somehow those temperate regionswere frozen in a moment. Some mammoths have been found frozen in the middle ofeating! There you are munching away and the next thing you know you’re an ice lolly.If this ionised ice did rain down from Venus, the biggest build up would have beennearest to the magnetic poles because they would have had the most powerfulattraction. Again, that is the case. The ice mass in the polar regions is greater at thepoles than at the periphery and yet there is less snow and rain at the poles to create sucha build up.21 The Venus scenario explains this. In the Book of Job, which is believed tobe an Arab work much older than the rest of the Bible, the question is asked: “Whencecometh the ice?” I would say we could have the answer. This further explains how theancients could have had maps of what the north and south poles looked like before theice was there. The poles were ice-free until about 7,000 years ago. There was no ice ageas officially suggested. It’s another illusion. When you look at the ‘evidence’ thatofficial science presents to support the conventional idea of an ice age and the way this‘evidence’ is fundamentally contradicted by the provable facts, it is astonishing howsuch nonsense could become conventional ‘truth’ in the first place.22 Before thisincredible cataclysm, and/or one of the others, the Earth had a uniform tropical climate,as fossilised plants have shown. This would have been changed not only by the arrivalof the ice on the surface, but also by the destruction of a canopy of water vapour aroundthe Earth, as described in Genesis and other ancient texts. This canopy would haveensured a uniform tropical climate everywhere, but suddenly it was gone.The dramatic change in temperature at the poles would have collided with thewarm air and caused devastating winds, exactly as described by Chinese folklore.The physicists said that the pressures created by the orbits of ‘Venus’ around theEarth would have produced a 10,000 foot tidal wave in the oceans and this againfits with the evidence that agriculture began at altitudes of 10,000 feet and higher.Plato wrote in his work, Laws, that agriculture began at high elevations after agigantic flood covered all the lowlands. The botanist, Nikolai Ivanovitch Vavilov,studied more than 50,000 wild plants collected around the world and found thatthey originated in only eight different areas - all of them mountain terrain.23 Thetidal wave would have produced pressures on the Earth’s surface of two tons persquare inch, creating new mountain ranges, and fossilising everything withinhours.24 Artificial stone today is created by pressures of this magnitude. Intact treeshave been found fossilised and that would be impossible unless it happened in aninstant because the tree would normally have disintegrated before it could befossilised over a long period of time.25 In fact, fossils of this kind are not formingtoday.26 They are the result of the cataclysmic events here described, Desborough"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"15says. The Russian-Jewish psychiatrist and writer, Immanuel Velikovsky, causedoutrage among the scientific establishment in the 1950s by suggesting that the Earthhad been through enormous upheavals when Venus which was then, he said, a comet,careered through this part of the solar system before settling into its present orbit.When Venus was photographed by the Mariner 10 mission, many of Velikovsky’sdescriptions proved correct, including what appeared to be the remnants of a comet-like tail. The Mariner 9 pictures of Mars also supported some of Velikovsky’s theories.He said that the ‘comet’ Venus had collided with Mars as it careered through the solarsystem. Velikovsky’s time for these events was about 1,500 BC. Different researchersdismiss each other’s findings because they suggest very different periods for majorupheavals when in truth there were almost certainly a number of cataclysms in thatwindow of 11,000 to 1,500 BC, and even more recently. The study by the physicistsalso said that Mars was devastated by these events involving Venus. They felt Marswas thrown out of orbit and followed a highly unstable elliptical orbit which took itbetween the Earth and the Moon every 56 years.27 The last of these passes appears tohave been about 1,500 BC when the great volcano exploded on the Greek island ofSantorini and the Minoan civilisation on Crete passed into history. In this same periodof 1,600-1,500 BC, ocean levels dropped about 20 per cent, glacial lakes formed inCalifornia, and this was most likely the time when the vast lake in the fertile Saharawas emptied and the desert we see today began to be formed.28 Eventually, Marssettled into its present orbit, but by then life on its surface had been obliterated. Yetagain the evidence on Mars supports all this. The Mars Pathfinder mission found thatMartian rocks lack sufficienf erosion to have been on the surface for more than 10,000years.29Brian Desborough believes, like the physicists he knew and worked with, that theEarth was once much nearer the Sun than it is today and that Mars orbited where theEarth now resides. If, as is claimed, the deep canyons on Mars’s surface were caused bymassive torrents of water, there had to have been a warmer climate on Mars, becausetoday it is so cold that water would freeze instantly and the near-vacuum atmospherewould make the water instantly vaporise.30 Desborough says that the Earth’s closerproximity to the Sun demanded that the first Earth humans were the black races withthe pigmentation to cope with the much fiercer rays of the Sun. Ancient skeletons foundnear Stonehenge in England and along the west coast of France display the nasal andspinal characteristics of many female Africans.31 Desborough says that Mars, then witha climate very much like ours, had a white race before the Venus cataclysm. Hisresearch has convinced him that the white Martians built the pyramids which have beenrecorded on Mars and they went to war with an advanced black race to conquer theEarth. These wars, he says, are the wars of the ‘gods’ described in endless ancient texts,not least the Hindu Vedas. Desborough adds that after the cataclysm, the white Martianswho had settled on Earth were stranded here without their technology and with theirhome planet devastated. These white Martians, he says, became the white peoples of theEarth. Fascinatingly, some scientists claim that when white people are immersed in"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"16sensory deprivation tanks for long periods, their circadian rhythm has a frequency of 24hours 40 minutes, which corresponds not to the rotational period of the Earth, but ofMars!32 This is not the case with non-white races who are in tune with the Earth’srotation. Desborough believes that these white Martians were the highly advanced raceof the ancient world known as the Phoenicians or Aryans and they began the longprocess of returning to their former technological power after the upheavals whichdestroyed the surface of their own planet and devastated this one. My own researchsupports this basic theme, although, like everyone seeking the truth of what happened, Ihave many questions. A white race, known as the Phoenicians and other names, wascertainly the ‘brains’ behind the Egyptian civilisation, at least from the period around3,000 BC, and the Giza Plateau, where the Great Pyramid was built, was formerlyknown as El-Kahira, a name which derived from the Arabic noun, El-Kahir, their namefor... Mars.33 Ancient texts reveal that the measurement of time was much related toMars, and March 15th, the Ides of March (Mars), was a key date in their Mars-relatedcalendar, as was October 26th. The first marked the start of Spring and the second wasthe end of the year in the Celtic calendar.34 The Holy Grail stories of King Arthurconnect with this theme, also. Camelot apparently jneans Martian City or City ofMars.35I think there is truth in all the views summarised in this chapter of the cataclysmicupheavals the Earth has suffered in the period between 11,000 and 1,500 BC. The firstone ended the Golden Age and obliterated the high-tech civilisations that had existedbefore then. The extraterrestrial races either left the planet beforehand or survived athigh altitudes or by going deep within the Earth. The same with the later cataclysm.Many of the extraterrestrials, and most Earth humans, did not survive these events.Those that did were left with the job of starting all over again without, at least at first,the technology available before. The survivors fell into two main categories, those ofmostly extraterrestrial origin who retained the advanced knowledge, and humans, theslave race in general, who did not. The former also fell into two camps. There werethose who wished to use their knowledge positively and communicate their informationto humanity, and those who sought to hoard the knowledge and use it to manipulate andcontrol. The struggle between those two groups over the use of the same knowledgecontinues to this very day. As societies recovered from those upheavals of 11,000 BC,the other cataclysms brought more devastation over the thousands of years thatfollowed and humanity was faced with many new beginnings.One common theme throughout, however, has been the manipulation of humanity byan intellectually, though not spiritually, advanced race or races of extraterrestrial origin.On that subject, I must now introduce an added dimension to this story which willstretch your credulity to breaking point."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"17SOURCES1T.

I wish I didn’t have to introduce the following informationbecause it complicates the story and opens me up to mass ridicule. But stuff it. If that iswhere the evidence takes me, that is where I shall go every time.I don’t think the Anunnaki of the Sumerian Tablets and the white Martians proposedin Brian Desborough’s scenario are the same people, although there may well be agenetic connection between them. Putting together the mass of evidence, views,research and opinions, that I have read or heard almost daily these past years, I feel theAnunnaki are a race from a reptile genetic stream. In UFO research these have becomeknown as reptilians. Nor am I alone in this view. I have personally been staggered byhow many people today are open to these possibilities and, indeed, are coming to thesame conclusions through their own research. These include many who would havelaughed at the very idea not so long ago. Dr Arthur David Horn, a former professor ofbiological anthropology at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, once believedemphatically in the Darwinist version of human evolution, the slow development of thehuman species via the principle of the survival of the fittest. Purely on the weight ofevidence and his own experience, he is now convinced that humanity was seeded byextraterrestrials and that a reptilian race has controlled the planet for thousands of yearsand continues to do so today. This is my own view, although I have taken a verydifferent life path to reach those same conclusions. Dr Horn’s research is detailed in hisexcellent book, Humanity’s Extraterrestrial Origins1 in which he suggests that the onesthe Sumerian Tablets call the Anunnaki are this reptile race, another point with whichwe agree. The famed British astrophysicist, Fred Hoyle, told a London press conferenceas long ago as 1971 that the world was controlled by a force which could manifest inmany forms. “They are everywhere,” he told astonished journalists, “in the sky, in thesea and on the Earth...” He said that ‘they’ controlled humanity through the mind. Iknow this sounds utterly bizarre, but you need to read the whole of The Biggest Secretto see the wealth of evidence to support this. If you pull out now or after a couple ofchapters because your belief system is in overload, that’s your choice, but you will missthe opportunity to see that the almost hysterically unbelievable is actually true.The more I weave together incredible amounts of information, the more it seems tome that we are talking of two distinct situations running side by side. There were otherextraterrestrial races at large on the Earth, and still are, as well as the extraterrestrial"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"20race which the Sumerians called the Anunnaki and other ancient texts called the SerpentRace. It could well have been that some of the others went to war with this reptilianAnunnaki. Ancient texts record these ‘wars of the gods’ all over the world and thesecould include conflicts between different extraterrestrial races as well as thosedescribed in the Sumerian Tablets that appeared to involve Anunnaki factions fightingwith each other. Today there are many modern accounts from people who claim to haveseen humanoid-type people whose skin and faces look like lizards and frogs with largeprotruding eyes. Jason Bishop III (a pseudonym), an investigator of the extraterrestrialphenomenon, says that the reptilians are mostly much taller than humans and are coldblooded like Earth reptiles.2 They appear to be far less emotionally sensitive thanhumans and most have great difficulty expressing love, though they are extremelyintelligent and have very advanced technology. I must say that is an excellentdescription of the attitudes and behaviour of the Brotherhood who control the worldtoday. The modern accounts of reptilians match the descriptions of many ‘gods’ of theancient world in the surviving texts and legends. The Ubaid culture existed between5,000 and 4,000 BC, even before Sumer, in what is now Iraq and figurines of their godsare clear representations of reptile-like, lizard-like humanoids. You can see a lizardUbaid figurine holding a lizard baby in the picture section. The region where the Ubaid-Sumer cultures emerged is fundamental to this whole story and the Ubaid figurinesdepict physically the descriptions of ‘gods’ which dominated many ancient societies.The Central American cultures had their winged serpent god, Quetzalcoatl; the HopiIndians had the plumed serpent god, Baholinkonga, and the Native American culture isawash with serpent imagery, including the mysterious serpent-shaped mound in Ohio;the East Indians speak of the reptilian gods, the Nagas (these were a race of ‘demons’ inIndian legend and their name means “Those who do not walk, but creep”); theEgyptians had their serpent god, Kneph, and pharaohs were often pictured withserpents; the Phoenicians had Agathodemon, another serpent figure; the voodoo peoplehave a god they call Damballah Wedo, who is depicted as a serpent; and the Hebrewshad Nakhustan, the Brazen Serpent. The ancient British god, known as the Dragon-Ruler of the World, was called HU and from this, very appropriately I would suggest,we get the term, Hu-man. The winged-disc symbol of the Sumerians, which is found allover the ancient world, was normally featured with two serpents. The symbolism of theserpent and its association with ancient ‘gods’ abounds throughout the world. TheReverend John Bathhurst Deane in his book The Worship Of The Serpent,3 wrote:“...One of (the) five builders of Thebes (in Egypt) was named after the serpent-god of thePhoenicians, Ofhion... The first altar erected to Cyclops at Athens, was to ‘Ops’, theserpent-deity... The symbolic worship of the serpent was so common in Greece, that JustinMartyr accuses the Greeks of introducing it into the mysteries of all their gods. TheChinese... are said to be superstitious in choosing a plot of ground to erect a dwellinghouse or sepulchre: conferring it with the head, tail and feet of diverse dragons which liveunder the Earth.”"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"21The idea of fire breathing dragons and evil serpents which appear in legends andtexts all over the world could easily originate from the reptilian ‘gods’ who onceoperated openly thousands of years ago. These were the Serpent People of ancient texts,including the Bible, where the serpent is a regular theme. Of course, the serpent hasbeen used to symbolise many things and not every reference will be literally a reptile,certainly not. But many of them are. There is also a common theme of a sacred placebeing guarded by a serpent or dragon. We have the serpent in the Garden of Eden andthe serpent/dragon theme is global. The Persians spoke of a region of bliss and delightcalled Heden which was more beautiful than all the rest of the world. It was the originalabode of the first men, they said, before they were tempted by the evil spirit, in the formof a serpent, to partake of the fruit of the forbidden tree. There is also the Banyon Treeunder which the Hindu ‘Jesus’, known as Khrishna, sat upon a coiled serpent andbestowed spiritual knowledge on humanity. The ancient Greeks had a tradition of theIslands of the Blessed and the Garden of the Hesperides in which grew a tree bearingthe golden apples of immortality. This garden was protected by a dragon.4 In theChinese sacred books there is a garden in which grew trees bearing the fruit ofimmortality and it, too, was guarded by a winged serpent called a dragon. In ancientMexican accounts, their version of the Eve story involves a great male serpent.5Another Hindu legend speaks of the sacred mountain of Meru guarded by a dreadfuldragon.6 Over and over we see the same theme of sacred places guarded by fearsomedragons and of a reptilian or a half reptile-half human, giving spiritual knowledge tohumans.The reptile species has a long, long connection with the Earth, going back more than150 million years to the dinosaurs and beyond. If we are to understand the true nature oflife we need to free our minds from the bonds of conditioning and realise that what wesee around us on Earth is only a tiny fraction of possibility. The reptile species, likelizards and snakes, are but one form of the reptilian genetic stream in this universe.While the dinosaurs were not all cold-blooded reptiles, as modern research has shown,the reptiles and dinosaurs are closely related by physical appearance alone and bothhave spawned an amazing variety of different forms. The dinosaurs manifested aseverything from flying creatures, large and small, to the eight-ton, Tyrannosaurus Rex.Are we really saying that reptile-dinosaur genetic streams that can produce suchdiversity, cannot manifest in a two-legged, two-armed form with a brain capacitythrough which a technically advanced consciousness can operate? More recently agreater understanding of the dinosaurs has revealed that many were very intelligent ahundred million years ago. The Saurornithoides, named from its appearance as a bird-like reptile, had a large brain, wide-set eyes that gave it stereoscopic vision, andfingers with opposing thumbs which allowed it to catch and eat small mammals.7Adrian J. Desmond, one of the world’s leading researchers into dinosaurs, says thatcreatures like the Saurornithoides, were separated from other dinosaurs “by a gulfcomparable to that dividing men from cows”.8 He asks: “Who knows what peaks thesophisticated ‘bird-mimics’ would have attained had they survived?”9 Studies have"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"22suggested that had the dinosaurs not been wiped out by yet another cataclysm about 65million years ago, they would have evolved into a reptile humanoid by now.10 DaleRussell, the senior paleontologist at Northern California University, was asked by theUS space agency, NASA, to produce a report on what extraterrestrial life might looklike.11 He evolved the Troodon dinosaur in line with natural genetic changes overmillions of years and created a model of a being he dubbed a Dino-sauroid. This had aremarkable resemblance to a reptilian humanoid and was identical to those described bypeople who claim to have seen reptile extraterrestrials. Who is to say that thisevolutionary leap from classic dinosaurs to reptilian humanoids did not happen inanother dimension or on another physical planet and perhaps on Earth before thedinosaurs were eliminated? In fact, were they all eliminated? Modern palaeontology(the study of fossils) now suggests that not all the dinosaurs were killed by themeteorite strike 65 million years ago and some continue to live today. More and moreevidence is emerging that birds are descendants of the dinosaurs. And while the bodiesof most dinosaurs might have been destroyed, their consciousness would have survivedbecause consciousness is energy and energy is indestructible. It can only be transmutedinto a different form. What happened to that dinosaur consciousness that dominated theEarth for 150 million years? As we’ve seen, the earliest accounts of Assyria, Babylon,Old Testament history, China, Rome, America, Africa, India and elsewhere, featurestories of the dragons. The serpent symbol has also been found in ancient Britain,Greece, Malta, Egypt, New Mexico, Peru and all over the Pacific Islands. There is anunmistakable resemblance between some dinosaurs and ancient depictions of dragons.Several species of small Indo-Malayan lizards with webbed wings look so much likedragons that they have been given the name Draco after the star constellation fromwhich the reptilian hierarchy are said to originate. Of even more interest to me is thearmoured lizard called Moloch Horridus which also has a dragon-like appearance.Moloch is an ancient deity to which children were sacrificed thousands of years ago andstill are today in the vast Satanic ritual network. They are sacrificed to the reptilians inother words because, as will become clear, many ‘demons’of Satanism are the reptilianswho have sought to take over the planet for thousands of years. Charles Gould who haswritten extensively about dragons and reptiles, says:“there is a lost species of lizard hibernating and carnivorous which had Draco-likewings and was protected by armour and spikes”.12 He believes its habitat was thehighlands of central Asia and its disappearance coincided with the Great Flood.13 Butthere are still sightings of giant ‘flying lizards’ in remote areas of the world, especiallyin Mexico, New Mexico and Arizona.Who are they and where do they come from?There are three suggested origins for the Anunnaki reptilian intervention in humanaffairs: 1 They are extraterrestrials; 2 They are ‘inner’ terrestrials who live within theEarth; 3 They manipulate humanity from another dimension by ‘possessing’ humanbodies. I think they are all true."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"23Extraterrestrials?Researchers into the reptilianphenomenon conclude that atleast some originate in the Dracostar constellation (see Figure 4).The Draco system includes thestar Thurban, once the NorthStar, by which the Egyptianpyramids are orientated.14According to the research ofauthor Graham Hancock, theancient temple complex atAngkor Wat in Cambodia is areplica of the Dracoconstellation as it would havebeen in 10,500 BC.15 This is the time when the Earth and its people, human andextraterrestrial, would have been recovering from the cataclysm of 11,000 BC andrebuilding their civilisation. The author and researcher, Robert Bauval, says that thepyramids at Giza align with the stars on the ‘belt’ of Orion as they would have been in10,500 BC when Orion was at the lowest point in its cycle (the Orions are anotherextraterrestrial race operating on this planet, I understand). And Hancock and otherresearchers suggest that the lion-bodied Sphinx at Giza, which is believed to be farolder than originally dated, would have directly faced the constellation of Leo the lionat that same time, 10,500 BC. Research continues under the ocean off Japan into afantastic structure which could also date to 10,500 BC at least. There are many whohave questioned these findings, especially the synchronisation of the Giza pyramids toOrion, but at the very least they have triggered an important area of investigation, evenif they prove not to be accurate in every detail. After all, finding the truth, especially sofar back, is hardly easy. It is certainly astonishing how the ancient structures andtemples, of apparently unconnected societies all over the world, align with each otherwith fantastic astronomical, mathematical and geometrical precision. But then, thesesocieties were not unconnected. As we shall see, they had the same origins. The templesat Angkor Wat are covered in reptilian images, a feature of all the ancient cultures,including the Egyptian, the Central American and the Indian. Professor Phillip Calahanin his study of the surviving and mysterious round towers of Ireland has said that theyare positioned with remarkable synchronicity to the star constellations of the northernsky at the winter solstice. And the towers most perfectly align with the constellationof... Draco. The head and eyes of the Draco formation, as designed on the ground inIreland, are, according to Calahan, located either side of Lough Neagh right in theFigure 4: The Draco ‘dragon’constellation to which so many ancientmonuments appear to be aligned."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"24centre of Northern Ireland. The eastern side of Lough Neagh is close to the capital,Belfast.16 So the head of the Draco constellation is positioned on the ground in NorthernIreland and that small country has been the scene of so much upheaval, murder andsuffering. By the end of this book, those who are new to these concepts will appreciate thepower of symbolism to attract energy to a place, negative and positive. John Rhodes,17 oneof the foremost of the researchers into the reptilian presence, says that they may be spaceinvaders who move from planet to planet, covertly infiltrating the host society andeventually taking over. The reptilian military, it is said, carry out abductions of lif9 formswhile their scientists study the biology and introduce the reptilian genetic code into speciesthey wish to manipulate. This involves a programme of crossbreeding and that is preciselywhat the Sumerian Texts are describing in relation to the Anunnaki. Rhodes adds that:“From their underground bases, the reptilian military ETs. . (establish).. a network ofhuman-reptilian crossbreed infiltrates within various levels of the surface culture’s militaryindustrial complexes, government bodies, UFO/paranormal groups, religious and fraternal(priest) orders, etc. These crossbreeds, some unaware of their reptilian genetic “mindcontrol” instructions, act out their subversive roles as “reptilian agents”, setting the stagefor a reptilian-led ET invasion.”18I only came across the work of John Rhodes in the last few days before this book wascomplete and by then, as you will see later in the detailed text, I had reached exactly thesame conclusions. Rhodes says that after the reptilians invade a planet from space andfrom their underground bases, the surface population quickly surrender to superiorweaponry. Then the reptilians strip the planet of its resources like water, minerals andDNA information. The infiltration of human society via secret societies is a key methodof reptilian control, as I shall detail. The American writer and researcher, WilliamBramley, concluded in his book, Gods Of Eden, that the Anunnaki created a secret societycalled the Brotherhood of the Snake and this has been used to manipulate humanity in theway described in the chapters that follow.19 This Brotherhood of the Snake is the corecentre of today’s global secret society network which is controlled by the reptilians.Inner-terrestriaIs?In their physical expression, the Anunnaki are one of the many inner-Earth races whichlive underground in the enormous catacombs, caverns and tunnels below the surface. AHopi Indian legend says that a very ancient tunnel complex exists under Los Angelesand this, they say, was occupied by a ‘lizard’ race some 5,000 years ago. In 1933 G.Warren Shufelt, an LA mining engineer, claimed to have found it.20 Today, it is said,some malevolent Freemasonic rituals are held in this tunnel complex. There has been amassive cover up by the authorities of the existence of these subterranean races andwhere they live. In 1909 a subterranean city which was built with the precision of theGreat Pyramid was found by G.E. Kincaid near the Grand Canyon in Arizona. It was bigenough to accommodate 50,000 people and mummified bodies found on the site were"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"25of oriental or possibly Egyptian origin, according to the expedition leader Professor S.A. Jordan.21 Numerous artefacts were found, including copper implements as hard assteel. The Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC has ensured these finds remainunknown to the public (that’s its job!) and no-one would have known about thisdiscovery had it not been for two articles in a local newspaper, the Arizona Gazette, inApril 1909. The researcher and author, John Rhodes, claims to have located this siteand he connects it with Sipapuni, the underground world from where the Hopi Indiansclaim to have originated. According to their legends, the Hopi once lived within theEarth and were fed and clothed by ‘ant people’, possibly the extraterrestrials known asthe Greys. The Hopi refer to their ancestors as their ‘snake brothers’ and their mostsacred of underground rituals is the snake dance. As I will keep emphasising, not allreptilians are of malevolent intent and I have no wish to demonise the reptile stream.We are talking here only of one group of them. The Hopi say that one day under theorders of their goddess, Spider Woman, they ascended to the surface of the Earth andemerged through their cave they called the Sipapuni. Once on the outside, the Hopi say,a mocking bird arrived to confuse their language and make different tribes speakdifferent tongues. This is such a repeat of the biblical story of the Tower of Babel that aconnection is obvious. To this day the Hopi will not recreate the images of their snakeancestors for fear of death. The layout of the underground world discovered in Arizonawas described by G.E. Kincaid as a “...mammoth chamber from which radiates scores ofpassageways like the spokes of a wheel”. This is also how the modern reptilianunderground base at Dulce, New Mexico is described, and concentric circles of people,compartmentalising different levels of knowledge, is the structure by which the globalBrotherhood manipulate the world. Arizona, New Mexico and the Four Corners areawhere the states of Arizona, Utah, Colorado and New Mexico all meet, are some of themost important regions on Earth for reptilian underground bases. But undergroundworlds and cities, ancient and modern, abound all over the planet. There are eyewitnessreports of giant humanoids sighted in the Hal Saflini catacombs in Malta during the1930s, which were closed after a party of schoolchildren and their guide disappeared.More than 30 vast ancient tunnel complexes and underground cities have been foundnear Derinkuya in Turkey. The list goes on and on. The mysterious creature known asthe Bigfoot, a large hairy ape-like creature, is allegedly from within the Earth. There is awidespread belief among UFO researchers that there are reptilian underground baseswhere they work with their reptile-human crossbreed elite and I have spoken to formerCIA employees who confirm this. A reptilian race definitely live within this planet in aphysical form and the only question is whether they are native to the Earth or if theyoriginate elsewhere? Again it is probably both, a mixture of the two.Other dimensional?My own research suggests that it is from another dimension, the lower fourthdimension, that the reptilian control and manipulation is primarily orchestrated. Withoutunderstanding the multidimensional nature of life and the Universe, it is impossible to"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"26follow the manipulation of the Earth by a non-human force. As open minded scientistsare now confirming, Creation consists of an infinite number of frequencies ordimensions of life sharing the same space in the same way that radio and televisionfrequencies do. At the moment you are tuned to the three-dimensional world or thirddimension and so that is what you perceive as your reality. You are tuned to this stationin other words. But, as with radio and television, all the other stations are broadcastingat the same time and if you move your radio dial or change the TV channel you canconnect with them. When you do this, the station or channel you were tuned to beforedoes not disappear, it continues to broadcast, but you can’t hear it or see it anymorebecause you are no longer on its wavelength. So it is with human consciousness. Somepeople (everyone if the truth be told) can tune their consciousness to other wavelengthsand connect with information and consciousness operating on that frequency. We callthis psychic power, but it is merely the ability to move your ‘dial’ to another ‘station’. Itis from one of these other stations or dimensions, that the Serpent Race, the Anunnaki,is controlling this world by ‘possessing’ certain bloodline streams. But as my researchcontinues, it is clear that the fourth dimensional reptilian controllers are themselvescontrolled by fifth dimensional entities. Where does it end? Who the hell knows. Yeah,yeah, yeah, I know it sounds off the wall, but the truth usually does. You can put thebook down now if it is too much to take, but you need to read it all to see whatenormous evidence there is that this is true. The ‘station’ from which the reptiliansoperate is the lower level of the fourth dimension, the one closest to this physical world.Other people know this as the lower astral dimension, the legendary home of demonsand malevolent entities going back to antiquity. It is from here that today’s Satanistssummon their demonic entities in their black magic rituals. They are actuallysummoning the reptilians of the lower fourth dimension. It is suggested by someresearchers, with good reason, that the non-physical reptilians were able to pour intothis dimension through holes or portals in the time-space fabric caused by the nucleartests and explosions which started in the deserts of New Mexico in the early 1940s. ButI think such holes began to be created a long time ago, before the cataclysms, when theworld was at an even more advanced technological stage than it is today.The reptilian control of Planet Earth involves all three of the above themes. I thinkthe reptilian genetic stream operates throughout the Universe and they are not allmalevolent, far from it. As with humanity, they contain the whole spectrum ofattitudes from love to hate, freedom to control. I am identifying a particular group ofthem, not the whole species - I cannot emphasise this enough. This controlling groupcame here from the Draco constellation and elsewhere, and this is the origin of termslike draconian, a word which sums up their attitudes and agenda. They love toconsume human blood and they are the blood-sucking demons of legend. Thevampire stories are symbolic of this and what is the name of the most famousvampire? Count Dracula! The ‘Count’ symbolises the aristocratic reptile-humancrossbreed bloodlines which the reptilians possess from the lower fourth dimensionand Dracula is an obvious reference again to Draco. The recent reports of the blood-"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"27sucking Chupacabra in Puerto Rico, Mexico, Florida and the Pacific Northwest fit thereptilian description. They have been seen sucking the blood of domestic livestock likegoats and their name means goat-sucker. The reptilians operate a pincer movement onthe human race. Their physical expression lives under the ground and interacts in theunderground bases with human and human-reptile crossbreed scientists and militaryleaders. They also emerge to engage in some human abductions. But the main controlcomes by outright possession. The crossbreeding programme (via sex and test tube) isdescribed in the Sumerian Tablets and the Old Testament (the Sons of God whointerbred with the daughters of men). These hybrid human-reptile lines carry thereptilian genetic code and thus can be far more easily possessed by the reptilians ofthe lower fourth dimension. As we shall see, these bloodlines became the British andEuropean aristocracy and royal families and, thanks to the ‘Great’ British Empire,they were exported across the world to rule the Americas, Africa, Asia, Australia,New Zealand and so on. These genetic lines are manipulated into the positions ofpolitical, military, media, banking and business power and thus these positions areheld by lower fourth dimensional reptilians hiding behind a human form or by mind-puppets of the these same creatures. They operate through all races, butpredominantly the white one.As is well acknowledged, there is an area of the human brain to this day known asthe reptile brain. Within the brain is the original segment to which all other parts areadditions. And, according to the neuroanatomist, Paul MacLean, this ancient area of thebrain is driven by another prehistoric segment which some neuroanatomists call the R-complex.22 R is short for reptilian because we share this with reptiles. MacLean saysthat this R-complex plays an important role in “aggressive behaviour, territoriality,ritualism and establishment of social hierarchies” 23 This is precisely the behaviourpatterns of reptilians and their reptile-human hybrids as exposed in this book. Theastronomer, Carl Sagan, knew far more than he ever made public and indeed he spentmuch of his career guiding people away from the truth. But his knowledge of the truesituation occasionally came through, as when he said that: “...it does no goodwhatsoever to ignore the reptilian component of human nature, particularly ourritualistic and hierarchical behaviour. On the contrary, the model may help usunderstand what human beings are all about.”24 He adds in his book, The Dragons OfEden, that even the negative side of human behaviour is expressed in reptilian terms, asin cold-blooded killer. Sagan (the name in reverse spells the East Indian reptilian gods,the Nagas) clearly knew the score, but chose not to reveal openly what he knew. As thehuman foetus is forming into a baby it goes through many stages which connect withthe major evolutionary points in the development of the present physical form. Theseinclude connections with non-primate mammals, reptiles and fish. There is a point inwhich the embryo develops gills, for example. The human embryo is very much likethose of birds, sheep and pigs until the eighth week when it goes its own evolutionaryway. Occasionally the genetic instructions fail to remember the latest script and somebabies are born with tails. These are called caudal appendages and form in the lower"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"28lumbar region. Most are immediately removed by doctors, but in some poorer countrieswhere such medical support is not available, there are people who live their whole liveswith tails.25 Pheromone is the substance secreted and released by animals so they can bedetected by members of the same species. The pheromones in human women andiguanas are a chemical match.26Look again at those figures at the start of the first chapter detailing the number ofplanets and stars that exist in the fraction of Creation we know about. The number oflife forms in this galaxy alone is beyond imagination and that’s only at the three-dimensional level of existence. If we judge possibility, as we do, only by what we seeon one little planet in one little solar system, our range of perception, imagination andvision will be so microscopic that an understanding of what is really happening to thisworld will be impossible. To that level of thinking the idea that a reptile race iscontrolling the planet from another dimension will be so far out as to beincomprehensible. That is the way the vast majority will, at first, receive theinformation in this book, but the appreciation of the ‘reptilian connection’ is growingamong researchers who are interested in the truth and not just concerned with defendinga belief system or looking for public approval.In a remarkable period of 15 days as I travelled around the United States in 1998, Imet more than a dozen separate people who told me of how they had seen humanstransform into reptiles and go back again in front of their eyes. Two televisionpresenters had just such an experience while interviewing a man who was in favour ofthe global centralisation of power known as the New World Order. After the liveinterview, the male presenter said to his colleague that he had experienced an amazingsight during the interview. He had seen the man’s face transform into a lizard-likecreature and then return to human. His female fellow presenter was astounded becauseshe had seen the interviewee’s hands turn reptilian. The male presenter also told me ofan experience a policeman friend had while making a routine visit to an office block inAurora, near Denver, Colorado. The policeman had commented to an executive of oneof the companies on the ground floor of the extreme nature of security in the building.She told him he should look at the higher floors if he wanted to know how extensive itreally was. She also pointed to a lift which only went to certain floors at the top of thebuilding and, as they chatted, she told him of something she had seen some weeksearlier. The lift had opened and a very strange figure had emerged. He was white to thepoint of being albino, but he had a face shaped like a lizard and his eye pupils werevertical like a reptile’s. This lizard-like figure had walked out of the lift and into anofficial-looking car waiting outside. The policeman was so intrigued that he used hisown time to check on the companies at the top of the building served by the mysterylift. He found they were all fronts for the Central Intelligence Agency, the CIA.Then there are the experiences of Cathy O’Brien, the mind controlled slave of theUnited States government for more than 25 years, which she details in her astonishingbook, Trance Formation Of America, written with Mark Phillips.27 She was sexuallyabused as a child and an adult by a stream of famous people named in her book. Among"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"29them were the US Presidents, Gerald Ford, Bill Clinton and, most appallingly, GeorgeBush, a major player in the Brotherhood, as my books and others have long exposed. Itwas Bush, a paedophile and serial killer, who regularly abused and raped Cathy’sdaughter, Kelly O’Brien, as a toddler before her mother’s courageous exposure of thesestaggering events forced the authorities to remove Kelly from the mind controlprogramme known as Project Monarch. Cathy writes in Trance Formation Of Americaof how George Bush was sitting in front of her in his office in Washington DC when heopened a book at a page depicting “lizard-like aliens from a far off, deep space place.”28Bush then claimed to be an ‘alien’ himself and appeared, before her eyes, to transform‘like a chameleon’ into a reptile. Cathy believed that some kind of hologram had beenactivated to achieve this and from her understanding at the time I can see why sherationalised her experience in this way. Anyone would, because the truth is too fantasticto comprehend until you see the build up of evidence. There’s no doubt that alien-basedmind programmes are part of these mind control projects and that the whole UFO-extraterrestrial scene is being massively manipulated, not least through Hollywoodfilms designed to mould public thinking. Cathy says in her book that George Lucas, theproducer of Star Wars, is an operative with NASA and the National Security Agency,the ‘parent’ body of the CIA.29 But given the evidence presented by so many otherpeople, I don’t believe that what Bush said and Cathy saw was just a mind controlprogramme. I think he was revealing the Biggest Secret, that a reptilian race fromanother dimension has been controlling the planet for thousands of years. I know otherpeople who have seen Bush shape-shift into a reptilian.The president of Mexico in the 1980s, Miguel De La Madrid, also used Cathy in hermind controlled state. She said he told her the Legend of the Iguana and explained thatlizard-like extraterrestrials had descended upon the Mayans in Mexico. The Mayanpyramids, their advanced astronomical technology and the sacrifice of virgins, wasinspired by lizard-like aliens, he told her.30 He added that these reptilians interbred withthe Mayans to produce a form of life they could inhabit. De La Madrid told Cathy thatthese reptile-human bloodlines could fluctuate between a human and iguana appearancethrough chameleon-like abilities - “a perfect vehicle for transforming into worldleaders”, he said. De la Madrid claimed to have Mayan-lizard ancestry in his bloodwhich allowed him to transform back to an iguana at will. He then changed before hereyes, as Bush had, and appeared to have a lizard-like tongue and eyes.31 Cathyunderstandably believed this to be another holographic projection, but was it really? Orwas De La Madrid saying something very close to the truth? This theme of being like achameleon is merely another term for ‘shape-shifting’, a theme you find throughout theancient world and, among open minded people, in the modern one too. Shape-shifting isthe ability to use your mind to project another physical image for people to see.Everything is energy vibrating at different speeds, so if you use your mind to re-vibratethat energy to a different resonance, you can appear in any form you choose. Manywitnesses have described how the so-called ‘Men in Black’ materialise anddematerialise when they threaten people who are communicating information about"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"30extraterrestrials and UFOs. They can do this because they are interdimensional beingswho can appear in any form. This is the main reason for the obsession withinterbreeding among the Elite bloodline families. They are seeking to maintain a geneticstructure which allows them to move between dimensions and shape-shift between ahuman and reptilian appearance. Once the genetic structure falls too far from it’sreptilian origin, they can’t shapeshift in this way. At NASA’s Goddard Space FlightCentre mind control laboratory near Washington DC, Cathy says she was taken throughanother alien theme by Bill and Bob Bennett, two well-known figures in United Statespolitics and fundamentally connected to the Brotherhood networks. After she was givenmind altering drugs, this is what she says she experienced:“In the darkness around me I could hear Bill Bennett talking: ‘This is my brother, Bob. Heand I work as one unit. We are alien to this dimension - two beings from another plane.’“The high4ech light display swirling around me convinced me I was transformingdimensions with them. A laser of light hit the black wall in front of me, which seemed toexplode into a panoramic view of a White House cocktail party - as though I hadtransformed dimensions and stood amongst them. Not recognising anyone, I franticallyasked: ‘Who are these people?’“‘They’re not people and this isn’t a spaceship’, Bennett said. As he spoke, the holographicscene changed ever so slightly until the people appeared to be lizard-like aliens. ‘Welcometo the second level of the underground. This is a mere mirror reflection of the first, an aliendimension. We are from a trans-dimensional plane that spans and encompasses alldimensions...’have taken you through my dimension as a means of establishing stronger holds on yourmind than the Earth plane permits,’ Bill Bennett was saying. ‘Being alien, I simply make mythoughts your thoughts by projecting them into your mind. My thoughts are yourthoughts.’32Again, this might simply be a programming device, but given the other evidence I ampresenting, is it not more likely that, under the effects of the drugs and other techniques,Cathy’s mind had switched to the dimension in which the reptilians operate? Thereptilians come from the lower fourth dimension and merely use physical bodies as theirvehicles to manipulate this one. It makes sense, therefore, that if you can tune your mindto their true dimension you will see them as they really are. Cathy’s descriptions mirrorthose of some ‘abductees’ who have recalled how their extraterrestrial abductors at firstlooked quite human, but then changed to look like humanoid lizards. Are these peoplereally abducted by aliens in spaceships, or are they subjected to mind control techniqueslike those experienced by Cathy O’Brien which connect them with the lower fourthdimension? Hunter S. Thompson in his book, Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas,33"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"31describes seeing reptiles while in a drugged condition and a guy I met in the UnitedStates (in those 15 days I mentioned earlier) told me a similar story. He ‘tripped’ onlarge amounts of LSD in the 1960s and in his seriously mind-altered state he would seesome people as humans and others as humanoid lizards and other reptiles. For a whilehe believed that he was merely hallucinating, but as a regular ‘tripper’ at high doses hebegan to realise that what he was seeing, usually by the third day of a five-day ‘trip’,was not an hallucination, but the vibratory veils lifting which allowed him to seebeyond the physical to the force controlling the person. In these moments the samepeople always had lizard features and the same people always looked human. Theynever switched. He also began to observe that those around him who appeared lizard-like in his altered state always seemed to react the same to movies, televisionprogrammes, etc. “We used to laugh and say ‘here come the lizards’,” he told me. Hebelieved there was, to use his own phrase, a ‘morphogenetic field’ which transmitted tothe DNA of the lizard-people and aligned the cell structure to the reptilian geneticblueprint. The more reptilian genes a person carries the easier it is for thiscommunication, or rather control, to take place. And the ones with the cell structuremost aligned to the reptilian blueprint are the Elite families that run the world to thisday. It is not without reason that Diana, Princess of Wales used to call the Windsors the‘lizards’ and the ‘reptiles’ and said in all seriousness: “They’re not human”. This wastold to me by a close confidant of Diana for nine years whom I quote at length later inthe book.At the end of that 15 days of meeting person after person telling me the same story ofseeing humans become reptiles, I was sitting in the speakers’ room at a Whole Life Expoevent in Minneapolis where I was appearing and was chatting about these experienceswhen a gifted psychic lady said that she knew what I was talking about, because she couldsee the reptiles inside and around the bodies of leading world politicians, and thebusiness, banking and military elite. This was possible because, as someone who hadaccessed her psychic sight, she could see beyond the physical and into the lower fourthdimension where these reptilians reside. What did Miguel De La Madrid say to CathyO’Brien? The reptile-human bloodlines could fluctuate between a human and iguanaappearance through chameleon-like abilities - “a perfect vehicle for transforming intoworld leaders”. This psychic lady said that most of the people in positions of powerappeared to be reptiles, but there were others who were still human and these people, shesaid, were “overshadowed and controlled” by a reptile, but they weren’t actually reptiles.We would call this being possessed. This is an important distinction. There are the ‘full-bloods’ who are reptilians using an apparent human form to hide their true nature, and the‘hybrids’, the reptile-human crossbreed bloodlines, who are possessed by the reptiliansfrom the fourth dimension. A third type are the reptilians who directly manifest in thisdimension, but can’t hold that state indefinitely. Some of the ‘Men in Black’ are examplesof this. Many of the possessed people will have no idea that this is so, but their thoughtsare the reptilians’ thoughts and they act in ways that advance the Agenda without realisingthe background to how and why they are being used. Leading Brotherhood families like"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"32the Rothschilds and the Windsors are full-bloods, reptilians wearing human physicalbodies like an overcoat in the full knowledge of who they are and the Agenda they areseeking to implement. Another comment the psychic lady made was that in her alteredstate of consciousness, Hillary Clinton appeared as a reptile, while her husband, BillClinton the US President, was only overshadowed and controlled by one. This isinteresting because my own research, and that of others, has revealed Hillary Clinton tobe much higher in the hierarchy than Bill, who, while of a crossbreed bloodline, is apawn in the game, to be used and discarded as necessary. It is not always that the mostpowerful people are placed in what appears to be the most powerful jobs. Often they arenot. They are the string-pullers of those who appear to have the power.There is another key difference between the full-bloods and the crossbreeds.Everything is created by sound. When you think or feel, you emit a wave of energywhich changes the energy around you to resonate at that same vibratory level. Thatwave is actually a sound, broadcasting beyond the range of human hearing. Formcannot exist without sound. As you can see in a fantastic series of videos calledCymatics,34 it is sound which turns matter into form. In the videos, sand and otherparticles are placed on a metal plate and this is vibrated by different sounds whichrearrange the sand into amazing, often geometric patterns. With each change of soundthe patterns change accordingly. Go back to the original sound and the original patternreturns immediately. It is like the waves that form the concentric circles of the planetaryorbits around the Sun I mentioned in the last chapter. The solar system is also thecreation of sound. Everything is. In the beginning was the word and the word was...sound. In the Cymatics videos you see the particles form into mini planets, solarsystems and galaxies, just through sound vibrations. Sound is also a wonderful form ofhealing because by resonating the body and its organs at their proper vibration they canbe healed. Illness is dis-ease, the disharmony of the natural vibrational state of the bodyand, because our thoughts and emotions are actually sound waves, our imbalancedthoughts and emotions disrupt the vibrational harmony and therefore lead to dis-ease.This is how emotional stress causes illness. It is so simple. Anyway, another incredibleexample of all this in the Cymatics videos is seeing almost human-like figures formingfrom the particles when certain sounds are emitted. Our bodies are also the result ofsound resonating energy into form and if our minds are powerful enough to change thesound range of the body, it moves into another form or disappears from this dimensionaltogether. This is what is called shape-shifting. It is not a miracle, it is science, thenatural laws of creation. The full-blood reptilians of the lower fourth dimension cantherefore make their ‘human’ physical form disappear and bring forward their reptilianlevel of existence. They shape-shift. To us in this dimension they appear human, but it’sjust a vibrational overcoat.After the first draft of this chapter was completed I met another woman, this time inEngland, who had been married to a man involved in Satanic ritual and theBrotherhood networks. He was head keeper of an area of land called BurnhamBeeches near the Buckinghamshire-Berkshire border a few miles from Slough, west of"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"33London. This is an ancient site mentioned in the Domesday Book at the time of Williamthe Conqueror in the 11th century and it has a reputation for Satanism. The lady whospoke to me was taking her dog for a walk across the land at dusk in the early 1970s whenshe saw a figure in a long red robe. When he lifted his head, she saw that his face was thatof a lizard. She obviously thought she was crazy, but this was no illusion, she said. The‘lizard’ was very real and very physical, not an apparition. She is very psychic and shelater began to see people either transform into lizards before her eyes or be overshadowedby them in exactly the way described by the American psychic. If you look in the picturesection you will see an artist’s impression of what she sees with her psychic sight andmany others have described exactly the same experiences. On July 20th 1988, a numberof people in Bishopsville, South Carolina said they were terrorised by a “seven foot talllizard-man that had no hair, eyebrows or lips, three fingers on each hand and large slantedeyes that glowed red in colour”. There were five sightings of this “lizard-man” and thestory was reported in the Los Angeles Times and the Herald Examiner.35When you go with the flow of life and listen to your intuition, you are shown whatyou need to know by the incredible synchronicity that daily surrounds you and guidesyou through the smokescreens and the halls of mirrors. One day in February 1998 inJohannesburg, South Africa, I spent nearly five hours talking with a Zulu shaman calledCredo Mutwa. The word Zulu means People from the Stars because they believe theyare a royal race that originates beyond this planet. We talked about the globalmanipulation and his belief that an extraterrestrial race is behind the global Brotherhoodof monarchs, politicians, bankers and media owners. Afterwards I went back to thehouse where I was staying and wrote down the main points he mentioned on my laptopcomputer before going downstairs into the lounge for the evening. As I sat down amovie was just starting, it was called The Arrival36 and was about a reptile-likeextraterrestrial race which had taken over the planet by operating through human bodiesand appearing to be human. Someone was trying to tell me something! And thatsomething is the truth. Another lesser-known movie I saw about this time was calledThey Live37 and again the theme was of an extraterrestrial race taking over the world byworking through human physical bodies. Alien Resurrection38 was another to carry thereptilian theme with the implication that the aliens were occupying the bodies ofhumans. But the closest any movie has come to the truth is the American televisionseries of the 1980s called V.39 It tells of a reptile extraterrestrial race who take over theworld by looking like humans. The film depicts the reptiles as being covered in somesort of latex skin, which is not how it works in reality, but the theme of the series isright on the button and a foretaste of things to come; unless we wake up fast. I highlyrecommend you think about watching the video of V to get a visual feel for the themes Iam exposing in this book.One of the leading researchers into this phenomenon has been the American, AlexChristopher, author of the books Pandora’s Box, Volumes I and II,40 which reveal, inpart, the reptilian presence on this planet. Alex has seen reptilians and what she calls thebig-eyed Greys. One night in Panama City, Florida she says she was called at 2.30 in"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"34the morning by her frantic neighbours, a woman and her partner, a commercial airlinepilot. When she ran over to their house, she found the woman passing out, sliding downthe wall with her eyeballs rolling. Alex said she felt an incredible energy in the roomthat seemed to be trying to penetrate her head. There was definitely radiation, she said,and the next day all the plants in the room were dead. She grabbed the couple and tookthem outside where they talked for a while. They said they had been making love whenthe incident began and this is very significant because the reptilians feed off humanemotional and sexual energy which is one reason why sex is so fundamental to Satanicrituals performed for the ‘demons’ - this reptilian group. The couple said they saw aflash of light and then they were pulled from the bed. The man still had a palm print onhis side made by fingers that must have been ten inches long with claws that burnedinto his skin. The next day that spot was so painful he couldn’t touch it and AlexChristopher has video footage of this. When the couple had calmed down and Alexwent back to bed in her house, she came face to face with a reptilian herself:“I woke up and there is this “thing” standing over my bed. He had wrajyaround yellow eyeswith snake pupils and pointed ears, and a grin that wrapped around his head. He had asilvery suit on and this scared the living daylights out of me. I threw the covers over myhead and started screaming... I mean, here is this thing with a Cheshire-cat grin and thesefunky glowing eyes... this is too much. I have seen this kind of being on more than oneoccasion... He had a hooked nose and was very human looking, other than his eyes, andhad kind of greyish skin........ Later on in 1991,1 was working in a building in a large city, and I had taken a breakabout 6pm and the next thing I knew it was 1O.3Opm and I thought I had taken a shortbreak. I started remembering that I was taken aboard a (space)ship, through four floors ofthe office building and through a roof. There on the ship is where I encountered Germansand Americans working together, and also grey aliens, and then we were taken to someother kind of facility and there I saw reptilians again... the ones I call the “Baby Godzil las”that have short teeth and yellow slanted eyes... The things that stick in my mind are thebeings that look like reptiles, or the “velcoci-rapters”. They are the cruellest beings youcould ever imagine and they even smell hideous.”41On the ‘ship’ she remembers seeing the Germans and Americans wearing an insignia, ablue triangle with a red-eyed dragon and circle around it. A contact later told her that shesaw the same symbol at Fort Walden in the United States. A winged serpent symbol couldalso be seen on the sleeve of an Israeli soldier as he comforted the daughter of theassassinated Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, at her father’s funeral in 1995. (See Newsweek,November 20th 1995.) One of Alex Christopher’s specialities is the new Denver Airportwhich is reputed to be a cover for a deep underground reptilian-human base. It is certainly astrange place. The first time I spoke on these conspiracy subjects in the United States wasin Denver in August 1996, and I’d landed at Denver Airport with no idea of its"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"35background. Even so, as soon as the plane landed I’d felt a very strange energy, veryweird and unpleasant. The airport was built at enormous cost on open land a long wayfrom Denver and it is full of Masonic symbols. There are also gargoyles, the winged-reptile figures that you find on the stately homes of the reptilian aristocracy in Britainand on the churches and great cathedrals of Europe which were built by the Brotherhoodnetwork. There are also gargoyles on a building in Dealey Plaza where PresidentKennedy was assassinated and now they turn up again in a modern airport built on analleged underground reptilian base. Gargoyles are symbols of the reptilians and that iswhy you will find them at Denver Airport. The capstone or dedication stone at the airportis marked with the classic compass symbol of the Freemasons and it stands in part of theterminal called The Great Hall, another Freemasonic term. On a wall is a grotesquemural full of malevolent symbolism, including three caskets with dead females in them:a Jewish girl, a Native American and a black woman. Another girl is holding a Mayantablet that tells of the destruction of civilisation. A huge character, described as a ‘greenDarth Vader’ by Alex Christopher, stands over a destroyed city with a sword in his handand women are walking along a road holding dead babies. All the children of the worldare depicted taking weapons from each country and handing them to a figure of aGerman boy with an iron fist and an anvil in his hand. Denver is apparently scheduled tobe the headquarters of the Western sector of the United States under the fascist globalstate called the New World Order which is planned beyond the year 2000. Atlanta is saidto be the centre for the Eastern sector and I remember thinking some years ago how thedesign of Denver and Atlanta airports were so similar - now I know why.Colorado is a major centre for the New World Order and the Queen of England,under another name, has been buying up land there. As you will see later, the BritishRoyal Family are massively involved in this story and so is the murder of Diana,Princess of Wales. One of Christopher’s main contacts was a guy called Phil Schneider,the son of a German U-boat commander in World War II, who was commissioned tobuild a number of deep underground bases in the United States. I saw some of hislectures on video when he began to speak out publicly about the underground networkof bases, cities and tunnels throughout the United States. He later died in verysuspicious circumstances which were meant to appear like ‘suicide’. Schneider said thatDenver Airport was connected to a deep underground base that went down at least eightlevels. It included a 4.5 square mile underground city and a vast base, he said. Othercontacts who have been underground at Denver Airport claim that there are largenumbers of human slaves, many of them children, working there under the control ofthe reptilians. Two of the bases that Phil Schneider claims to have helped to build arethe infamous Area 51 in Nevada and Dulce in New Mexico, which is connected by thetunnel network to the Los Alamos National Laboratory. I have been to Los Alamos andthe vibes are simply horrible. After speaking about the reptilian involvement in humanaffairs on the Sightings radio show in the United States, I was sent an account by anarmy private stationed on the surface at Dulce. He realised there was something ‘mightyodd’ about the place, but could not explain why. He remembered:"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"36I was working on a routine job when another of the young enlistees, a mechanic, came inwith a small rush job he wanted welded at once. He had the print and proceeded to showme exactly what he wanted. We are both bending over the bench in front of the welderwhen I happened to look directly into his face. It seemed to suddenly become covered in asemi4ransparent film or cloud. His features faded and in their place appeared a “thing” withbulging eyes, no hair and scales for skin.”He later saw the same thing happen to a guard at the Dulce front gate. Other witnesseshave spoken of seeing more reptilian-chameleons working at the Madigan MilitaryHospital near Fort Lewis, south of Seattle in Washington State. Again I have spoken in thatgeneral area and found it all extremely strange, not least there being a ‘New age’ centreclose to Fort Lewis. Jason Bishop III has conducted extensive studies into the Dulceoperation and established the involvement of a cartel that I expose in .. .And The TruthShall Set You Free, including organisations like the Rand Corporation, General Electric, AT& T, Hughes Aircraft, Northrop Corporation, Sandia Corporation, Stanford ResearchInstitute, Walsh Construction, the Bechtel Corporation, the Colorado School of Mines andso on. Bechtel (Beck-tul) is a major link in the Brotherhood-reptile network. There are atleast seven levels underground at Dulce, probably more, and Bishop has compiledaccounts of workers there who have described what they have seen. Their accounts mirrorthe descriptions of the Anunnaki in the Sumerian Texts as they interbred species to producehideous hybrids of many types. This is what workers have said about Dulce:“Level number six is privately called “Nightmare Hall”,it holds the Genetic Labs. Reportsfrom workers who have seen bizarre experimentation, are as follows: ‘I have seen multi-legged “humans” that look like half human/half octopus. Also reptilian-humans and furrycreatures that have hands like humans and cry like a baby, it mimics human words... alsoa huge mixture of lizard-humans in cages.’ There are fish, seals, birds and mice that canhardly be considered those species. There are several cages (and vats) of wingedhumanoids, grotesque bat-like creatures... but three and a half to seven feet tall. Gargoyle-like beings and Draco-reptoids.“Level number seven is worse, row after row of thousands of humans and human mixturesin cold storage. Here, too, are embryo storage vats of humanoids in various stages ofdevelopment. (One worker said:) ‘...I frequently encountered humans in cages, usuallydazed or drugged, but sometimes they cried and begged for help. We were told they werehopelessly insane, and involved in high risk drug tests to cure insanity. We were told neverto try to speak to them at all. At the beginning we believed that story. Finally, in 1978, asmall group of workers discovered the truth.”’42This discovery apparently led to the ‘Dulce Wars’, a battle between humans and theextraterrestrials in 1979 when many scientists and military personnel were killed. PhilSchneider claimed to have taken part in a shoot out with the aliens at Dulce in which he"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"37was hit by a laser gun which cut open his chest. Certainly he had a fantastic scar downhis chest, as he revealed publicly. The base was closed for a time as a result of thisconflict, but has since reopened. Another reptilian underground base is under BoyntonCanyon in Sedona, Arizona. The centre of the base is believed to be in the, appropriatelynamed, Secret Canyon. Similar bases and underground cities exist across the world andthey are connected by tunnels with incredibly fast ‘tube-shuttles’. The tunnels are builtvery quickly by technology like the Subterrene, a nuclear-powered machine that meltsthe rock and shapes it into the tunnel walls. It was developed at Los Alamos. It issignificant that underground nuclear tests were carried out in Nevada and New Mexico,the location of many deep underground facilities which have been connected withreptilians. Were those ‘tests’ located there to open up vast underground caverns? Anothertheme I have had from many contacts is that the reptilians can feed off nuclear energy.What they look likeSummarising all the research I have read, the people I have met, and the accounts ofthose who claim to have experienced these reptile humanoids or reptilians, the followingappears to be the case. There are many sub and crossbreed races of the reptilians. Theirelite is known by UFO researchers as the Draco. These are the ‘big boys’ in every senseand they are usually between seven and twelve feet tall. They have wings which are flapsof skin supported by long ribs.43 The wings can be folded back against the body and theyare the origin of the term “winged serpent”. They are also the origin of the term ‘fallenangels’ and the winged gargoyles are symbolic of these Draco. The cape worn by CountDracula is symbolic of these wings and the character of Dracula in the Bram Stokerstories is said to be a fallen angel. The winged Draco are also known as the Dragon Raceand some of the ancient gods were described and depicted as birdmen. This could be oneof the origins of the Phoenix and eagle in Brotherhood symbolism, as well as the moreesoteric meanings. The biblical Satan is depicted as a reptilian, too.Some of the Draco reptilian hierarchy are apparently white or albino white and notthe usual green or brown, and this connects with the description of the strange ‘albino’lizard humanoid in the building in Aurora, near Denver. The Draco are the ‘royalty’ ofthe reptilians and the highest caste are the albino whites, who apparently have conicalhorns midway between the brow and the top of the skull. This struck me immediatelybecause the ancient ‘gods’ and royalty were depicted as wearing a horned headdress,symbolic of these ‘royal’ reptilians, I’m certain. Other species, like the soldier class andscientists, are known as Reptoids. They don’t have wings, but all of them are cold-blooded.44 Their scales are much larger on their backs and they have three fingers withan opposing thumb. They have three toes with a fourth towards the side of their ankleand their claws are short and blunt. They have large, cat-like eyes which glow red and amouth that looks more like a slit. Some have eyes which are described as black andothers are white with flame-coloured vertical pupils. Again this is what the ladydescribed in the Aurora case. The reptilians are five to twelve feet tall and they are the‘giants’ described so widely in the ancient legends and records. Some have tails, others"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"38do not. One of their other planets of influence long ago is reckoned to have been Marsand so were reptile crossbreeds among the white Martians even before they came here?Zecharia Sitchin also speculates that the Anunnaki went to Mars before coming toEarth. This would certainly fit the picture and it could well be that the white Martians inBrian Desborough’s scenario and the Annunaki have long been genetically connected.A high priestess of the Brotherhood hierarchy who has broken out of their clutches, atleast at the time I spoke with her, says that the reptilian Anunnaki invaded Mars longago and the white race of Martians eventually left that planet for Earth. The Anunnakion Mars followed, she said, although I have no doubt that some are there now inunderground bases. Whenever one of the NASA Mars probes is in danger of letting thepublic see something they shouldn’t, the link mysteriously goes down or the probedisappears altogether. What is without question is that the white race, whatever itsorigin, has been the main vehicle of the Anunnaki crossbreeding programme for thetakeover of Planet Earth. Researchers believe that the reptilians are the controllers ofthe so-called Greys, the classic extraterrestrial figure of modern times with their bigblack eyes. The Greys feature in most of the abduction accounts. Jason Bishop III in hiswritings on this subject says that the hierarchy of control is: Draco (winged reptilian);Draco (non-winged); Greys; Humans. There also appears to be a reptilian ‘alliance’with some other extraterrestrial groups.It is suggested that human sacrifice to the ‘gods’ in the ancient world, particularlyof children, was for the benefit of reptilians who demanded these rituals (a trait of thereptile brain is ritualism). I am sure this is true and it will be extremely relevant in thelatter part of this book. At the moment of death by sacrifice a form of adrenalinesurges through the body and accumulates at the base of the brain and is, apparently,most potent in children.45 This is what the reptilians and their crossbreeds want, it issaid, and they certainly feed off human blood and flesh. These ancient sacrifices wereliterally to the gods, the Anunnaki reptilians, and they continue today. The commontheme of all research into the reptilians is that they are emotionless and withoutsentiment and, at the fourth dimensional level, they feed off the energy of lowvibrational human emotions like fear, guilt and aggression. When we emit suchemotions their energy can’t be seen in this world because it resonates to the lowerfourth dimensional frequency and there it is absorbed by the reptilians. The more ofthese emotions that can be stimulated, the more energy the reptilians have to workwith. Thus we have the encouragement of wars, human genocide, the mass slaughterof animals, sexual perversions which create highly charged negative energy, and blackmagic ritual and sacrifice which takes place on a scale that will stagger those who havenot studied the subject.Sons of the godsThe reptilian breeding programme appears to have produced an Anunnaki-humanhybrid (Adam?) around 200,000-300,000 years ago. I’m sure other extraterrestrial raceshave also interbred with humanity to produce the glorious variety of Earth peoples, but"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"39I am focusing here on the reptilian group because of their desire to control andmanipulate human affairs. Clearly, the farther you go back the murkier the storybecomes, but there is enough supporting and cross-referencing evidence to present thethemes of what happened. The more I look at this, the more it is clear to me that whatthe reptilians did on Mars they have done here. They infilitrated the home populationthrough interbreeding and took the place over. It seems to me that there were alreadyreptile-Aryan bloodlines among the Martians when they came to Earth. One of themain locations for the Anunnaki and the Martians or Aryans, particularly during andafter the Venus cataclysm of around 4,800 BC, were the mountains of Turkey, Iran andKurdistan, and it was from here that they and their hybrids re-emerged when thewaters receded. It was they who created the ‘instant’ advanced civilisations in the lowlands of Sumer, Egypt, Babylon and the Indus Valley. A particular centre for theAnunnaki reptilians would seem to have been the Caucasus Mountains and this is anarea that will appear again and again in this story. I feel there was a major breedingprogramme in this region, probably underground, which produced a very large numberof hybrid reptile-human crossbreeds. One area of research that is highly relevant tothis region are the number of people with Rh negative or rhesus negative blood. Oftenrhesus negative babies turn blue immediately after birth. This is the origin of the term‘blue bloods’ for royal bloodlines and other terms like ‘true blue’. It is speculated thatthe ‘blue’ bloodlines could be of Martian decent and from wherever the Martianbloodlines came from before that. Far more white people are Rh negative than blacksor Asians.The genes of the albino-white ‘royal’ Draco appear to have been used to create the‘royal’ reptile-human hybrid bloodlines which have been used to rule the world sinceancient times. These were the ones known to the ancients as the demi-gods, who weregiven the task of middlemen, controlling the population and running the worldaccording to the Agenda of their reptile masters. What is clear is that while theAnnunaki interbred with many Earth races, the white race has been their main vehiclefor taking over the planet and the ‘royal’ Draco at the top of their hierarchy are albinowhite. Significantly, when you look at ancient accounts, many of their hybrid creationshad blond hair and blue eyes. A major change would seem to have taken place soonafter the Venus upheavals because the Ubaid culture (5,000-5,000 BC), in what is nowIraq, worshipped gods who were depicted as lizard-humanoids while the Sumerians(4,000-5,000 BC), who lived in the same area, depict their gods as very human. Thischange, and the crossbreeding programme in the Caucasus region, are fundamentallyconnected, I’m sure. The Anunnaki-human crossbreed elite was described by theSumerians and there are many other accounts of the interbreeding of extraterrestrialsand humans, or the ‘gods’ and ‘sky people’ interbreeding with humanity. This is mostfamously noted in Genesis where it says:“When men began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born tothem, the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful, and they married any"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"40of them they chose... The Nefilim were on the earth in those days -and also afterwards -when the sons of God went to the daughters of men and had children by them. They werethe heroes of old, men of renown.”Genesis 6:1-4According to the translations of Zecharia Sitchin, the word Nefilim relates to“Those Who Decended” while others say it means “the fallen ones” or “those whohave fallen”. The word ‘renown’ in that passage in Genesis is translated from theSumerian word shem. This has been translated in the Bible as relating to ‘name’, as inmaking a name for yourself as a man of renown. Sitchin says the real meaning of shemis ‘sky vehicle’. He says it comes from the root, shu-mu, which means ‘that which is aMU’, and a MU was a flying craft, he says. So ‘men of renown’ becomes ‘men orpeople of the sky vehicles’. It was these who interbred with human women. Thispassage in Genesis, I would suggest, tells of the interbreeding between theextraterrestrials or inner terrestrials with humans to produce the reptile-human hybrids.The term ‘sons of God’ in fact comes from the Hebrew, bene-ha-elohim, which reallytranslates as ‘sons of the gods’. The early offspring of these genetic encounters werethe giants of legend and there are many records of such hybrids being born. There arenumerous accounts throughout the ancient world, on every continent, of a giant raceand the biblical Goliath could well have been symbolic of these people. The NativeAmericans have many tales of the Star People coming down from the skies to breedwith human women and Alex Christopher says that a common denominator in theabduction of humans by reptilians in the United States appears to relate to the person’sbloodline, particularly those that go back to Native Americans or ancient Indians. TheHopi, you will recall, speak of originating within the Earth. The Ethiopian text, theKebra Nagast (Nagas were Indian shape-shifting ‘serpent gods’), is thousands of yearsold, and it refers to the enormous size of the babies produced from the sexual orgenetic unions of humans and the ‘gods’. It tells how: “...the daughters of Cain withwhom the angels (extraterres-trials) had conceived... were unable to bring forth theirchildren, and they died.” It describes how some of these giant babies were deliveredby caesarean section: .... having split open the bellies of their mothers they came forthby their navels.”46 In the ancient Hebrew text, the Book of Noah, and its derivative, theBook of Enoch, a strange birth is described of a non-human child, who turns out to beNoah of Great Flood fame. References to this also appear in the Dead Sea Scrolls, therecords of the Essene Community in Palestine 2,000 years ago which included muchmaterial from the Book of Enoch. The strange child the texts describe is the son ofLamech. He is said to be unlike a human being and more like ‘the children of theangels in heaven’. Lamech’s child, Noah, is described as white skinned and blond-haired with eyes that made the whole house ‘shine like the Sun’. Blond-haired, blue-eyed beings with laser-like eyes is a description for mysterious people or ‘gods’ whichspans thousands of years to the present day and appear in cultures across the world.Lamech questions his wife about the father of the child:"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"41“Behold, I thought then within my heart that conception was (due) to the Watchers and theHoly Ones.. .and to the Nephilim. . .and my heart was troubled within me because of thischild.”47In the Shahnemeh or Book of Kings, the legendary history of Iran completed in 1010AD by the Arab poet, Firdowsi, he describes the birth of a baby called Zal, the son of aking called Sam. Again the king is horrified by the unearthly appearance of his child whohas a very large body ‘as clean as silver’, hair as white as an old man’s and ‘like snow’,and a face compared with the Sun. Sam calls his son a demon child, a child of the daevas- the Watchers. Like the patriarchs of the Old Testament, the Iranians appeared to have anaversion to children born with extremely white features. And who is said to be extremelywhite, albino white? The royal hierarchy of the Draco.The text of the Shahnemeh says of Zal:“No human being of this earthCould give such a monster birth,He must be of the Demon race,Though human still in form and face,If not a Demon, he at least,Appears a party-coloured beast.“48Zal later marries a foreign princess called Rudabeh, thedaughter of Mehrab, the king of Karbul, and a descendantof the Serpent king, Zahhak, who was said to have ruledIran for a thousand years. This was one of the reptilianbloodlines and in keeping with this, Rudabeh is describedas tall as a teak tree, ivory white etc, the familiar featuresof the Watcher-human offspring. These descriptionsabound for the royal lines of Iran and the Near East, as dotheir comparison with trees because of their great height.It seems from their texts that you required theNefilim-Watcher physical characteristics to qualify to be king. This, no doubt, is the originof the ‘divine right of ki;gs’, the right to rule by virtue of your family bloodline, a systemwhich continued when these lines expanded into Europe. Even the British title of Sir,conferred by the Queen on her selected subjects, comes from an ancient snake-goddess(reptilian) called Sir, which relates to the Anunnaki goddess, Ninlil or Ninkharsag, in theSumerian tablets. Her husband, Enlil, was called the Splendid Serpent of the shining eyes.His brother, Enki, was also known as a serpent and his emblem was two entwined serpents,the symbol of his ‘cult centre’ at Eridu, and of the modern medical profession. The symbolis known as the caduceus (see Figure 5). This information comes from the SumerianTablets as translated by Zecharia Sitchin and described in his books. Therefore I found itstaggering that Sitchin personally told me there was no evidence of a serpent race andFigure 5: The ancient caduceus,symbol of the modern medicalprofession and symbolic of manythings, Tncluding, quite possibly,the twin spirals of DNA or perhapsrepresenting a particularwavelength or frequency."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"42advised me to cease my research into such matters. The idea that there is no evidence issimply ludicrous, so why would Sitchin say that to me? He was adamant that I shouldend this line of research. I have absolutely no doubt that the Anunnaki and the Watchersare the same reptilian race - the ‘serpents with the shining eyes’ identified by Christianand Barbara O’Brien in their work, Genius Of The Few.49Author and researcher, Andrew Collins, says he has a Canaanite copper figurine depictingone of their gods of around 2000 BC.50 It has a serpentine neck and a head shaped like thehood of a cobra which curls over to form a snake-like headdress.51 Over the thousands ofyears since these royal reptile-human hybrid bloodlines were created, they have become moreintegrated into the general populafion and less physically obvious, but the basic geneticstructure remains and the Brotherhood maintains very detailed genetic records of who has itand who doesn’t. Christian and Barbara O’Brien say in Genius Of The Few that if theAnnunaki had interbred with humanity hundreds of thousands of years ago and then interbredwith them again about 30,000 years ago, the result of the second interbreeding would be agenetic structure that was 75% Anunnaki and 25% human. I think there was another breedingprogramme far more recently, after the Venus flood of about 7,000 years ago. These laterbloodlines would have been even more Anunnaki than previous versions, of course. These arethe reptilian crossbreeds who run the world today and it this profusion of reptilian geneswhich allows such people to shape-shift into reptilians and back into an apparently humanform. These bloodlines also have the ability to produce an extremely powerful hypnotic stare,just like a snake hypnotising its prey, and this is the origin of the term ‘giving someone theevil eye’. All this is the real reason for the obsession with blood and the interbreeding of the‘blue blood’ families and their offshoots. This is why since the earliest times of knownhistory, the blue blood heirs married their half-sisters and cousins, just as the Anunnaki didaccording to the Sumerian Tablets. The most important gene in this succession is passed on bythe female line, so the choice of female sexual partner has been vital to them.It is highly significant that the ‘serpent king’ bloodline should originate from Iranbecause it is from this region of Iran, Kurdistan, Armenia, Turkey and the CaucasusMountains, that these reptile-human bloodlines emerged to take over the world. ABrotherhood insider, a Russian, said there was a massive vortex, an interdimensionalgateway, in the Caucasus Mountains where the extraterrestrials entered this dimension.That would explain a great deal. The name Iran comes from the earlier Airy-ana or Air-an, which means Land of the Aryas or Aryans.52 Still today there are two distinct racesin Kurdistan, the olive skinned of medium height with dark eyes, and the much taller,white skinned people, often with blue eyes. You will note that these traits wereconsidered the ‘Master Race’ by the Nazis and this was because the Nazis knew thehistory and the connection with the reptilians. Andrew Collins in his book, From TheAshes Of Angels, presents compelling evidence that the biblical Garden of Eden washigh up in this region of Iran-Kurdistan and, of course, the theme of the serpent is at theheart of the Eden story. In neighbour-mg Media, the kings were known by the Iraniansas Mâr which means snake in Persian.53 Mars = snake? They were called the ‘dragondynasty of Media’ or the ‘descendants of the dragon’54. I have no doubt that the"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"43reptilian Draco interbred with humans to produce crossbreeds within the white race and,indeed, there are many people around the world today who claim to have bred withreptilians. By 2,200 BC the Royal Court of the Dragon had been founded in Egypt bythe priests of Mendes and this still continues today 4,000 years later, as the Imperial andRoyal Court of the Dragon Sovereignty, now headquartered in Britain. Some peoplecall this the Brother-hood of the Snake. The early kings of Sumer, Egypt, and later,Israel, were anointed at their coronation with the ‘fat of the Dragon’ which was the fatof the sacred crocodile. The croc was known in Egypt as a messeh and from this comesthe Hebrew term ‘Messiah’ which means Anointed One. The kings of the successionwere also known as ‘Dragons’ and all this symbolism relates to the knowledge thatthese royal families were the bloodlines of the reptile-human crossbreeds. When manykingdoms joined together in battle, they appointed a king of kings and he was known asthe Great Dragon or... Draco. The famous Celtic title, Pendragon, is a version of this.Kingship actually originates from the word kin or blood relative and kin-ship becamekingship. Just to emphasise the point about the reptile bloodlines here, the name theEgyptians gave to their sacred messeh or crocodile was... Draco. This also became asymbol of the Egyptian Therapeutate and their branch in Israel called the Essenes, andit was represented as a sea serpent or Bistea Neptunis by the ‘royal’ Merovingians andtheir decendents in France. The same tribe, all of them. If you look in the picture sectionyou will see an ancient Egyptian depiction of a ‘god’ on the temple wall at Saqquara - itis a non-human reptilian figure with what appear to be wings.Blond-haired, blue-eyed beings with eyes like lasers are still being reported. AnAmerican friend told me of an experience her father had in the early 1970s. They lived inTurkey at the time where he worked at a listening post for American Military Intelligence.He came home one night in a terrible state. When asked what was wrong, he justmumbled: “The world is not like we think it is”. Although he rarely drank, he asked for ascotch, and then another. As he relaxed he told his daughter of a communication he hadtaken that day from the pilot of a plane which was stationed at the Turkish base. The pilotreported that he was flying near the North Pole when suddenly his engines stopped and allthe electrical systems switched off. The plane then gently lowered itself vertically to theground and to his disbelief a mountain top opened up and the plane came to rest inside.What he saw was a scene straight from James Bond. He got out of the plane wonderingwhat the hell was going on and he was met by tall, blond-haired people with ‘pearl’coloured skin and ‘bluish-purple’ eyes which appeared electrically charged somehow: likelaser eyes. They all wore long white gowns and, perhaps significantly, this is how thecentral-South America ‘god’ known as Quetzalcoatl was described. They also wore aMaltese Cross medallion on a chain. The pilot’s memory was hazy about what happenedafter he first met ‘ole blue eyes’, but he remembered walking into a room and seeing agroup of these beings sitting around a conference table. Eventually, he was taken back tohis plane and as it rose from the mountain his engines and electronics restarted. Nowhaving heard the descriptions of these beings by a modern US pilot, look at how the Bookof Enoch describes the Watchers:"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"44“And there appeared to me two men very tall, such as I have never seen on earth. Andtheir faces shone like the sun, and their eyes were like burning lamps... Their hands werebrighter than snow.”55This would connect also with the ancient description of ‘gods’ as the ‘shining ones’.There is certainly much more to our history than we are being told and much morehappening on this planet today than most people could even begin to believe. Manyextraterrestrial races, not only the reptilians, operate in and around the Earth on this orhigher dimensions. Beings from Orion and the Pleiades are among many other racesreported by abductees and researchers to be interacting with humans. From what I hearfrom Brotherhood insiders who have seen some of these extraterrestrials, the Orions (acruel, but beautiful race according to my contacts) have some kind of alliance with thereptilians. I am sure that the biblical angels were the Watchers, the reptilians, winged andotherwise. The very term ‘sons of the gods’ is translated in the Septuagint, the Greekversion of the Old Testament, as angelos - angels. It appears from my research that thereare different reptilian factions: those who are more positive in their attitude to humanityand those who wish to dominate and control. They both became known as Watchers orangels, the latter as fallen angels. It could well be that the legends of St Michael castingthe dragon onto the Earth for the final battle and St George defeating the dragon, relate tothe long-standing conflict between the genuine white Martians and the reptilian Anunnaki.St Michael and St George are ancient Phoenician heroes from the very region of the worldwhere the Anunnaki instigated their crossbreeding programme and, for a long time,operated openly as reptilians. In the last book of the Bible, the Book of Revelation, we seethe clear connection made between the being known as Satan and the serpent or reptile:“And the great dragon was cast down, the old serpent, he that is called the Devil andSatan, the deceiver of the whole world; he was cast down to earth and his angels werecast down with him.”56“...And he laid hold on the dragon, the old serpent, which is the Devil and Satan, andbound him for a thousand years, and cast him into the abyss, and shut it, and sealed itover him, that he should deceive the nations no more.”57In a Dead Sea Scroll fragment translated by the Hebrew scholar, Robert Eisenman,there is a description of a watcher called Belial (Bel?), who is described as the Prince ofDarkness and the King of Evil. He is said to be terrifying in his appearance - like aserpent with a visage like a viper. One of the main angelic groups in Hebrew lore is theSeraphim or ‘fiery serpents’ and the Watchers are very much connected to thedescription of serpents. In the Persian teachings they also talk of a being they describeas ‘the old serpent having two feet’, just as the Book of Enoch features walkingserpents. When you consider that the Draco royal leadership is said to be up to 12 feettall and white skinned, indeed albino white, ‘whiter than snow’, it again relates to the"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"45very white skin of the giant Watcher-human hybrid babies described in the Book ofEnoch and elsewhere. And, I should emphasise, the birth of the human-Watcher child inthe Book of Enoch is that of Noah. If this be so, Noah is, in fact, a reptile-human hybridand many peoples have sought to claim descendence from Noah -descendence from thereptilian Watchers and Anunnaki. In Hebrew myth, the Nefilim are described as awwimwhich means devastators or serpents. In the Dead Sea Scrolls, Noah is described aslooking like “the children of the (fallen) angels of heaven” whose “conception was (due)to the Watchers... and to the Nefilim”. In Jewish lore, Eve is seen as the ancestral motherof the Nefilim and associated with the Hebrew words meaning life and snake. Eve was,of course, tempted by the serpent according to Old Testament myth and other sources. InChapter 69 of the Book of Enoch we find that among the Watchers who revealed thesecrets to humans was Gadreel, the fallen angel who has been identified with temptingEve. The Book of Enoch was banned by the Roman Church which sought to deny theearlier Christian belief in the existence of flesh and blood angels and fallen angelsoccupying physical bodies and interbreeding with humans. This was to stop the massesunderstanding the true situation. But the Freemasons, who control the Roman CatholicChurch today along with other Brotherhood offshoots, have always looked upon Enochas one of their legendary founders. The very name Enoch means ‘initiated’.The theme of the fallen angels giving forbidden secrets to humanity can be found inthe Book of Enoch and other works. Among these tellers of secrets is Azazel, whotaught the art of metal making, and Shemyaza, who taught the magical arts. These talesspawned many later heroes based on this theme, the most famous of which is the Greekgod, Prometheus, who is said to have stolen fire (knowledge) from the gods and given itto humans (selected humans). A gold statue of Prometheus stands in the RockefellerCenter in New York. The Rockefellers are reptilian full-bloods and therefore are fullyaware of the true significance and background of the Prometheus legend. Incidentally,the Watcher called Azazel is the origin of the goat head in Satanic ritual and the term‘scapegoat’. According to the Book of Leviticus, the Israelites would sacrifice two malegoats at Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. One was offered to God and the other toAzazel. The priest placed both hands on the head of the Azazel goat and confessed thesins of the people. The goat would then be taken into the wilderness and plunged over acliff, symbolising the fallen angel Azazel, who was seen as bound and chained in thewilderness - the ‘abyss’ in the language of the Book of Revelation - which I think isimprisonment in the lower fourth dimension. From this comes the ancient theme of thescapegoat which manifested in one form as the symbolic story of ‘Jesus’. The goat headof Azazel, a fallen angel-reptilian, is symbolised by the inverted pentagram of Satanism.We can debate the details and we should because there is a vast amount ofinformation still to be uncovered. I have an endless stream of questions myself. Butthere are some emerging themes: extraterrestrial races have been visiting the Earth withvarying intent for probably millions of years and their interbreeding has created themany racial streams. In the distant past there have been highly advanced technologicalcivilisations based on this extraterrestrial knowledge - a Golden Age as the ancients"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"46called it. Around 450,000 years ago the Anunnaki arrived, a reptilian race led by thewinged, albino-white Draco, and they sought to take over the planet. It is probable thatthey had by this time also settled and occupied Mars. For a long time the Anunnakilived openly as reptilians, but for whatever reason, possibly hostility from otherextraterrestrial races and humanity, they literally went undercover. They set out tohijack the planet by appearing to be human. This included a crossbreeding programmewhich created human-reptilian hybrid bloodlines through which they could operatefrom the lower fourth dimension. The fourth dimensional reptilians wear their humanbodies like a genetic overcoat and when one body dies the same reptilian ‘moves house’to another body and continues the Agenda into another generation. You could think of itas wearing and discarding space suits. These creatures are the ones the psychics see asreptilians inside human physical bodies. It seems that they need to occupy a veryreptilian dominated genetic stream to do this, hence certain bloodlines always end up inthe positions of power. Other less pure crossbreed human-reptilians are those bodieswhich are possessed by a reptilian consciousness from the fourth dimension and theseare people who psychics see as essentially human, but ‘overshadowed’ by a reptilian.The crossbreeding to infuse reptilian genetics into these bloodlines makes thispossession far easier than for those with fewer reptilian genes. This is why theBrotherhood maintains such detailed records of the genetic lines. They then knowwhich people can be possessed more easily than others. The reptilians seek, however, toinfluence everyone by stimulating the behaviour patterns of the reptile region of thebrain -hierarchical thinking, aggression, conflict, division, lack of compassion and aneed for ritual. By ritual I don’t just mean dressing up in a Satanic ceremony. There aremany examples of the human obsession with ritual, including doing the same things atthe same time, day after day, week after week. The reptilians have used the white raceas their main route to global control, but they have crossbred with all races includingthe Chinese, Japanese, Arabs and those known as Jewish. All this allows the reptiliansto control apparently unconnected people and organisations. It is the extraterrestrialversion of members of the same secret society working in many places of influence,while the rest of the population have no idea that they are connected. You can look at aseries of apparently different human beings in different positions of power who come tothe same conclusion and agree the same policy. That would appear to be a policy bornof democracy and open debate. But what if the same force is controlling all of them?That would then be dictatorship, but unless you knew the true situation how could youtell? This is what is happening with the reptilians working through human bodies andthe secret society network these bloodlines have created or infiltrated.The Book of Enoch says that those born of the Nefilim blood (the reptile-humanhybrids) are, because of their ancestral spirit, destined to “afflict, oppress, destroy,attack, do battle and work destruction on the earth” 58 In other words, those bodies canbe possessed by their ‘ancestral spirit’ - the reptilians of the lower fourth dimension. Inthe United States there is an organisation called the Sons of Jared, named after thefather of Enoch. They pledge an ‘implacable war’ against the descendants of the"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"47Watchers who “as notorious pharaohs, kings and dictators, have throughout historydominated mankind”. In their publication, the Jaredite Advocate, they condemn theWatchers as “like super-gangsters, a celestial Mafia ruling the world” .59 Many peopleask me how today’s Brotherhood Elite can cause such death, destruction and suffering,without showing any emotion. At least some of the reptile genetic streams do not appearto feel emotion like humans and they seem to be far more ruthless, too. I’ve justdescribed George Bush, Henry Kissinger, David Rockefeller and so on, and that’s notsurprising because they are examples of the reptile race at work in the human sphere.What I have outlined in this chapter will astonish even most of those who havefollowed my work and supported it over the years, and I understand that. But I havelearned from enormous, and at times extreme, experience to follow the flow of life andgo where it takes me. When I feel the rhythm of life, I dance. When I hear it speak tome, I listen. I go where the music takes me, no matter how incredible it may be or whatconsequences it may have for my life. For those who haven’t tried that yet, you will beamazed at what an adventure life suddenly becomes, what knowledge you can access,grasp and understand, when you go with the flow and cease to wage war with it for fearof being different. For most people so often the head gets in the way because they fearstepping outside of convention. They fear what other people will think and say aboutthem. But how can you expose the unthinkable unless you think the unthinkable? Arewe saying that we know it all? Is there nothing left to know? Of course there is. Weknow only a fraction of it all. And what has been the force that has brought us even toour current state of knowledge? Those who have dared to think and communicate theunthinkable. Without such people the human race cannot evolve; it just runs on the spot,living within a perpetual prison of the mind. What was that they said? Humans will fly?Ridiculous! That we can travel beyond the speed of sound? Crazy! That we can createbabies in a test tube and clone the human and animal species? Ludicrous! Yet all andmore have been done by those who have thought the unthinkable while the massesmocked. Give it a try before you forget how to do it. Think beyond the bounds of whatyou are told is reality.To refuse to do so is the ultimate prison cell, the ultimate mental and emotionalstagnation - the ultimate control. Indeed it is the way we have been controlled since thiswhole scam began.SOURCES1Dr Arthur David Horn, Humanity’s Extraterrestrial Origins, ET Influences On Humankind’sBiological And Cultural Evolution (A and L Horn, PD Box 1632, Mount Shasta, California,96067, 1994)."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"482Jason Bishop Ill, Matrix ii, compiled by Valdamar Valerian (Arcturus Book Service, USA, 1990),p 96.3Rev John Bathhurst Deane, The Worship Of The Serpent (J.

They settled on the lowlands and plainsand began to rebuild. This was when Sumer, Egypt and the civilisation in the IndusValley suddenly appeared at a very high level of technological advancement, althoughthey had existed before and were now restored after the upheavals.The Sumerian society began at the peak of its development because of this suddeninfusion of knowledge and the white Aryan race, originally from Mars, expanded outfrom the Caucasus Mountains and the Near East down into Sumer, Egypt and the IndusValley where, as even conventional history agrees, highly advanced societiesspontaneously emerged. However within this white race, and others also, was a geneticstream I will call reptile-Aryan or reptile-human. Whenever I use the term Aryan I amreferring to the white race. These were the crossbreed bloodlines created from thegenetic manipulation of the Anunnaki. The major centre for the reptile-Aryanbloodlines, in the ancient world after the flood waters receded, was Babylon in thesouth of the Sumer region alongside the River Euphrates. A closer look at the evidenceappears to date the foundation of Babylon far earlier than previously believed and itwas one of the first cities of the post-flood era. It was here that the mystery schools andsecret societies were formed which were to span the globe in the thousands of years thatfollowed. The Brotherhood which controls the world today is the modern expression ofthe Babylonian Brotherhood of reptile-Aryan priests and ‘royalty’ which came togetherthere after the flood. It was in Babylon in this post-flood period from around 6,000years ago that the foundation beliefs - manipulated beliefs - of today’s world religionswere established to control and rule the people.The founder of Babylon according to ancient texts and legend was Nimrod whoreigned with his wife, Queen Semiramis. Nimrod was described as a ‘mighty tyrant’ andone of the ‘giants’. The Arabs believed that after the flood it was Nimrod who built orrebuilt the amazing structure at Baalbek in the Lebanon with its three stones weighing800 tons each. It was said that he ruled the region that is now Lebanon and, accordingto Genesis, the first centres of Nimrod’s kingdom were Babylon, Akkad and others inthe land of Shinar (Sumer). Later he expanded further into Assyria to build cities likeNineveh where many of the Sumerian Tablets were found. Nimrod and Semiramis (orthe beings those names symbolised) were from the reptile bloodlines which also becameknown as Titans, the genetic streams of the reptile-possessed humans and the full blood"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"51reptilians. This race of ‘giants’ or ‘Titans’ was said to have been descendants of Noah,the baby described in the Book of Enoch (previously the Book of Noah) as being aWatcher-human hybrid with extremely white skin. The father of Nimrod in the text ofGenesis was Cush, also known as Bel or Belus, who was the grandson of Noah and sonof Ham. Cush became known as the deity, Hermes, which means Son of Ham.1 Ham orKhem means the ‘burnt one’ and may have been connected to Sun worship.2 A greatnetwork of deities emerged from Babylon and its connections with Egypt.Nimrod and Semiramis have remained the key deities of the Brotherhood to this dayunder many different names and symbols. Nimrod was symbolised as a fish and QueenSemiramis as a fish and a dove. Semiramis is likely to be symbolic of Ninkharsag, thecreator of the reptile-human crossbreeds. Nimrod was the fish-god Dagon who wasdepicted as half man, half fish.3 It is possible that this was symbolic of him being halfhuman, half scaled reptile. Queen Semiramis was also symbolised as a fish because theBabylonians believed fish to be an aphrodisiac and it became the symbol for theGoddess of Love.4 Hence the use of the fish in Christian symbolism and architecture. Inher role as the ‘Holy Spirit’, Semiramis was pictured as a dove holding an olive branchand Semiramis means ‘branch bearer’ as in ‘Ze’ (the) ‘emir’ (branch) and ‘amit’(bearer).5 Note also the symbolism of this in the story of Noah and the Great Flood,when the dove came back bearing an olive branch. The return of the reptilians after theflood? The name, Semiramis, was evolved from the earlier Indian deity, Sami-Rama-isior Semi-ramis.6 A fish and a dove are two symbols still widely used in religious ritualand national ceremony, although most of the people involved have no idea of the truemeaning. Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Northern Ireland terrorist group the IRA,has a dove as its symbol and you find the dove on many of the sceptres held by theBritish monarch (see picture section). Both organisations are modern fronts for theBabylonian Brotherhood and the doves symbolise Queen Semiramis. The dove to themis not a symbol of peace, but of death and destruction because of the reverse symbolismthe Brotherhood employs. If it is positive to the masses, it is negative to theBrotherhood, and this allows their negative symbols to be placed throughout the publicarena. No-one complains because they have no idea what these symbols, like the dove,really represent.Semiramis was called the Queen of Heaven (also Rhea), the Virgin Mother of the Gods,and sometimes known as the Great Earth Mother (Ninkharsag). She was also worshippedunder the name Astarte ‘the woman who made towers’ and this could refer to the Tower ofBabel (Babylon) which Nimrod is said to have built. The bloodlines of European royaltycame from the reptile-Aryan bloodlines of Babylon and the crown evolved from thehorned headgear worn by Nimrod. The horns symbolised the monarch’s authority and laterbecame a metal headband with three horns symbolising royal power with divine authority7This is represented by the symbol of the fleur-de4is which you find throughout the regaliaof modern royalty (see Figure 6 overleaf). As I have mentioned already, the Draco ‘royal’hierarchy, the winged albino whites, are said to have horns and I’m sure this is the trueorigin of the horned headgear of ancient royalty. The classic depiction of the Devil also"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"52has Draco-like horns. Nimrod was given the title Baal (theLord) and Semiramis was Baalti (My Lady). The Latinterm for my lady is Mea Domina which in its corruptedItalian form became Madonna.8 Nimrod was represented ina dual role of God the Father and Ninus, the son ofSemiramis, and her olive branch was symbolic of thisoffspring produced through a ‘virgin birth’. Ninus was alsoknown as Tammuz who was said to have been crucifiedwith a lamb at his feet and placed in a cave. When a rockwas rolled away from the cave’s entrance three days later,his body had disappeared. Heard that somewhere before?This husband-wife-son theme of Nimrod-Semiramis-andNinus/Tammuz became the Osiris-Isis-Horus mythologyof the Egyptians with its equivalent in India, Asia, China and elsewhere. Much later itwould be Joseph, Mary and Jesus. When the Babylonians held their Spring rites to markthe death and resurrection after three days of Tammuz-Ninus, they offered bunsinscribed with a solar cross. Yes, even the hot cross buns of British Easter traditioncome from Babylon. Easter comes from another face of Queen Semiramis - Ishtar -andit is from this, and possibly another Brotherhood deity, Ashtaroth, that we get the nameof ‘Ashtar’ as in ‘Ashtar Command’, a completely manipulated New Age belief in anextraterrestrial ‘hero’ who has come to save us. The Babylonian myths and symbolismprovided the foundations for all the major religions, especially Christianity. The RomanChurch was the creation of the Babylonian Brotherhood and the Pope still wears a mitreshaped like a fish head to symbolise Nimrod. This is also the significance of hisFisherman’s Ring. The Chair of St Peter in the Vatican was claimed to be a holy relic, butin 1968 it was exposed by a scientific commission as being no older than the 9th centuryMore significantly, according to the Catholic Encyclopaedia, is that it is decorated bytwelve plates portraying the twelve labours of Hercules. This same work claims thatHercules was another name for Nimrod before becoming a deity of the Greeks.9 In 1825,Pope Leo XII authorised the production of a jubilee medal and it depicted a woman in apose that was blatant symbolism of Queen Semiramis. She had a crucifix in her lefthand, a cup in her right and on her head was a seven rayed crown like the one on theStatue of Liberty, another depiction of Semiramis which was given to New York byFrench Freemasons. A contact who has relatives working in high positions in the Vaticantold me how, during the reign of Pope John Paul II, he was given a guided tour of theplace which blew his mind. He was shown the Pope’s solid gold bath which is decoratedwith all the astrological symbols and he saw inside the vacuum-sealed vaults whichcontain thousands of ancient esoteric books which have been stolen and hoarded overhundreds of years of religious dictatorship and so taken out of public circulation. TheRoman Church and the Babylonian Brotherhood are one and the same.Nimrod was also Eannus, the god with two faces, who was later known to theRomans as Janus. One of the Anunnaki brothers, Enki the ‘serpent god’, was alsoFigure 6: The Fleur-de-lis, symbolof the Babylonian trinity of Nimrod,Queen Semiramis and Tammuz,among other things."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"53known as Ea. The Freemasonic eagle with two heads looking left and right, east andwest, is symbolic of Nimrod in the role of Eannus, and I would suggest that the eagle issymbolic of the winged Draco. Eannus, it was said, held the keys to the doors of heavenand he was the sole intermediary between God and humanity, therefore any belief notsupported by him was false and should be condemned. This was a wonderful tool forthe Babylonian priesthood to impose their will on the populous and exactly the samescam has been played by their successors, the Christian priests, the Rabbis and thepriesthoods of Islam, Hinduism and all the rest. The Roman Catholic title of cardinalcomes from the word ‘cardo’ meaning hinge and relates to Nimrod’s role as guardian ofthe door to heaven.10 The Babylonian priests even established a governing body theycalled the Grand Council of Pontiffs, a name later transferred to the Church of Rome.11The Babylonian High Priest, who instructed the inner circle initiates, was known as...Peter, meaning the ‘Great Interpreter’. The feast day of the Christian St Peter wastraditionally celebrated on the day the Sun entered the astrological house of Aquarius,the very day that Eannus and Janus were honoured!12 The Babylonian religion, like allthe look-alikes that were to follow, consisted of two levels. The masses weremanipulated into believing superstitions and into taking symbolic stories literally, whilethe chosen initiates were given the real knowledge on penalty of death if they everrevealed it. In this way the truth about life, human potential, history and the reptilianAgenda, were lost to the population and kept only for the few.Human sacrifice was fundamental to the religion of Babylon and wherever theBabylonian Brotherhood and their reptilian bloodlines have travelled, human sacrificehas always gone with them because the reptilians demand these rituals. The malevolentones seem to be addicted to blood and this has been passed on to their crossbreeds asthe evidence I shall present will show. The Babylonian priests were required to eatsome of their sacrificial offerings and so the word for priest, Cahna-Bal, became theterm for eating human flesh, cannibal.13 Moloch, the name of that flying lizard Imentioned earlier, was another name for Nimrod-Tammuz. Tam means ‘to perfect’ andmuz means ‘to burn’. You can see the symbolism of Tammuz-Moloch, therefore, in therituals of burning children alive in honour of this deity which, staggeringly, still go ontoday. The Beltane ritual later performed in Britain by the Druids on May 1st, May Day,involved the burning of children in the belly of a huge wicker effigy of a man. This wasinherited from the Babylonians when the Brotherhood expanded across Europe. Indeedit may well be that the reptilians had once based themselves in what is now the UnitedKingdom and Ireland before they moved their main focus to the Near East and Africa.The Feast of Tammuz was on June 23rd and celebrated his ascension from theunderworld. When he was resurrected, Tammuz was known as Oannes, the fish god,and Oannes is a version of the name, John.14 For this reason, John has been used as asymbol for Tammuz-Nimrod in symbolic characters like John the Baptist. June 23rd, theFeast of Tammuz, became the Christian day called St John’s Eve! The Nimrod-Semiramis combination has been depicted under countless names in the civilisationsand cultures which have followed. These deities throughout the world may seem to be"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"54an unfathomable tidal wave of names, but they are overwhelmingly different names forthe same two figures. Another deity widely used in Satanism for the sacrifice ofchildren today is Kronos, the king of the Cyclops in Greek legend. He was known asthe tower builder and is almost certainly another version of Nimrod, the builder of thebiblical Tower of Babel.15The reason the reptile bloodlines are involved in such unspeakable ritual andpractice today, is quite simply because they always have been. When you follow thesebloodlines across history, you find they use the same rituals and sacrifice to the samedeities, right to the present day. Another passage in the Book of Enoch tells of theWatchers breeding with human women and the behaviour of the offspring theyproduced:“And they became pregnant, and they bore great giants... who consumed all theacquisitions of men. And when men could no longer sustain them, the giants turnedagainst them and devoured mankind. And they began to sin against birds and beasts, andreptiles, and fish, and to devour one another’s flesh and drink blood. The Earth laidaccusation against the lawless ones.”16That passage describes the bloodlines I am highlighting and they came together inthe Babylonian Brotherhood which has since expanded across the planet. While welook out of our eyes and feel part of this physical world, the reptiles look into this thirddimension, much like someone looking through a window. In this case, the eyes of thephysical body. We are consciously in the third dimension, they are consciously in thefourth looking into the third. When you know what you are looking for it is the eyesthat give them away. They are dark, piercing and cold. The reptile full-bloods are notattached to their bodies like humans. They are knowingly using them as ‘space suits’ tooperate in this world, and when one wears out they simply occupy another. It is fromthis process of ‘possession’ by the reptilians and other low vibrational entities that wehave the ancient tales, indeed modern ones too, of demons, devils and evil spirits takingover a human mind and body. It is the reptilians and other consciousness of the lowerfourth dimension, the cesspit vibration as I call it, which are summoned during Satanic,black magic rituals and it is during these rituals that many unsuspecting puppets are‘plugged in’ to the reptilian consciousness and taken over. So it was in Babylon and soit is today. As I revealed in I Am Me I Am Free, and will elaborate upon in this book, theBrotherhood hierarchy today are seriously into Satanic ritual, child sacrifice, blooddrinking and other abominations that would take your breath away. Yes, I am talkingabout some of the biggest royal, political, business, banking and media names on theplanet. People like Henry Kissinger, George Bush, the British royal family and manyother presidents, prime ministers and members of royalty. Fantastic? Of course it is, butsince when did the truth not sound fantastic in a world of such denial and illusion?Three of the principle elements of the Babylonian religion were fire, serpents and theSun. I should explain their focus on the Sun because it is a vital part of the story. Most"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"55of the global population worshipped the Sun for its obvious gifts of heat and light and theeffect this had on their crops and well-being. However, within the hierarchy of the BabylonBrotherhood and other Elite groups which had the advanced knowledge, they focused onthe Sun for other reasons too. They understood the true nature of the Sun as amultidimensional consciousness which extends across the solar system on unseenfrequency levels. Even in this physical dimension, the Sun’s emissions of magnetic energyare constantly affecting us second by second. The Sun has a diameter of some 864,000miles and contains 99% of the matter in the Solar System.17 It is an immense ball of energywhich works very much like an atomic bomb and the internal temperature can reach asmuch as 14 million degrees centigrade.18 It rotates faster at the equator than at the polesand therefore the activity and stimulation of the Sun’s magnetic field is simply colossal.The writer and researcher Maurice Cotterell has made a long and detailed study of sunspotand solar flare activity when the Sun is projecting immensely powerful magnetic energy.This has been photographed as gigantic loops of fire, some 100,000 miles high.19 Thisenergy travels to the Earth on the solar wind and it can affect computer systems and causepower blackouts. But for the Van Allen Belts, the zones of radiation which surround theplanet and connect with the Earth’s magnetic field, the Sun’s energy would ‘fry’ us.Maurice Cotterell studied the sunspot cycles and established short, long and greatcycles of solar activity, as he explains in his book with Adrian G. Gilbert called TheMayan Prophecies.20 When Cotterell’s research was already advanced, he came acrossthe amazing mathematical system of numbers and symbols left by the ancient Mayapeople in Central America. The Maya claimed to have originated with the ‘gods’ andrecognised a lost island as their former home. Their astonishingly accuratemathematical and astronomical systems, and their measurement of time, were inheritedfrom much older cultures and ultimately from the extraterrestrials. We have alreadyseen that Mexican President Miguel De La Madrid claimed that the Mayans wereinterbred with the reptilians, the ‘iguana race’ as he put it.Maurice Cotterell was fascinated to realise that the Mayan cycles of humanevolution corresponded remarkably with his sunspot cycles of magnetic emissions.Even over thousands of years, they were incredibly close. This is perfectlyexplainable. Everything is energy. Life is the interaction of magnetic vibrational fields.Change the magnetism and you change the nature of the energy field. Change theenergy field and you change the nature of mental, emotional, spiritual and physicallife, all of which are energy in different forms. The other planets do this as they circlethe Sun and affect the magnetic field of the Earth: we call this astrology. Cotterellbelieves that we are effected by these fields most powerfully at the time we areconceived rather than the time we are born, a point which has much validity. I feel thatboth powerfully affect us. His research established that sunspot activity correspondswith the human fertility cycles and with the emergence and demise of greatcivilisations and empires. Scientists have also discovered that humans have an internalclock which is in sync with the Sun. In short, the Sun’s effect on human life isfundamental and far beyond its obvious contribution of warmth and light. The"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"56extraterrestrials knew this in these ancient times and the Sun was viewed with awe. Itis the physical and spiritual heart of the solar system and it came to symbolise thecreator, particularly the male aspects of the creative force... ‘He Who Is The Light OfThe World’. This knowledge of the Sun will be a common theme throughout the rest ofthis book as we journey through history to the present day. It does, however, make thedecoding of history a little more complex because the ancients would constantly useSun and astrological symbolism in their stories and some of the names for their godswould be used to symbolise the Sun and the planets. Working out what is literal andwhat is symbolic is a considerable challenge. I also think that the term ‘Sun god’ hasbeen used to symbolise the extraterrestrials and their crossbreeds, who were said in theancient texts to have faces which shone like the Sun - the Shining Ones. Imagine thepower you would have to advance an Agenda and manipulate the human race if youknew the cycles of energy from the Sun and other planets and how they were likely toaffect human consciousness. You would know when people would be more prone toanger, aggression, fear, doubt and guilt, and therefore when to have your wars,economic collapses and so on. The Brotherhood have always had this knowledge andthey use it to great effect today as I shall document.The Babylonian Brotherhood and its reptilian bloodlines expanded across the Middleand Near East, especially to Egypt, and eventually into Europe and the Americas. I thinkthe early Egyptian civilisation after the Venus upheavels was the work of the Aryans fromMars, the Phoenicians, with or without the reptilian Anunnaki. But before 2,000 BC thereptilians were taking over. The Royal Court of the Dragon was founded by the priests ofMendes in around 2,200 BC and this still exists today as the Imperial and Royal Court ofthe Dragon Sovereignty. The author, Laurence Gardner, is the present Chancellor of theImperial Court of Dragon Sovereignty and his postal address in Devon, England is atColomba House. Columba = dove = Queen Semiramis. According to Gardner, the nameDracula means ‘Son of Dracul’ and was inspired by Prince Vlad III ofTransylvania-Wallachia, a Chancellor of the Court of the Dragon in the 15th century. Theprince’s father was called Dracul within the Court. Dracul = Draco. Wherever they went,the Babylonian Brotherhood created their own mystery schools to manipulate thepopulation into believing a nonsense and into giving away their power through superstitionand fear. At the same time the higher levels of these pyramid structures communicated theadvanced knowledge to those who would serve the reptilian Agenda. Where other non-reptilian initiation schools existed, they were infiltrated and taken over by the Babylonianpriesthood. Mystery schools have been around for tens of thousands of years, probablyhundreds of thousands, and they are used to pass on advanced knowledge to those thehierarchy and priests decide are worthy enough. In his book, The Masters Of Wisdom, J. G.Bennett writes of how the Russian mystic, Gregori Gurdjieff, told him that the mysteryschools went back at least 30,000 to 40,000 years.21 Gurdjieff said he had learned this fromcave drawings in the Caucasus Mountains and Turkestan (that area again). I often hearNew Age people scream with indignation at the thought that the ancient mystery schoolswere part of the manipulation. Well, first of all there should be no structures, whatever"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"57their intent, that deny knowledge to people. I don’t care what their intent may be, onceyou consider it your right to deny knowledge and decide who should and should nothave access to it, you are playing a very dangerous and arrogant game. There werethose of positive intent who wanted to use the mystery schools to give the knowledgeto people they believed would use it wisely and I am not suggesting that all theseschools were malevolent, certainly not. But even the positive ones were eventuallyinfiltrated by the servants of the reptilians. As Manly P. Hall, the Freemasonichistorian, wrote:“While the elaborate ceremonial magic of antiquity was not necessarily evil, there arosefrom its perversion several false schools of sorcery, or black magic, (In Egypt)... the blackmagicians of Atlantis continued to exercise their superhuman powers until they hadcompletely undermined and corrupted the morals of the primitive Mysteries... they usurpedthe position formerly occupied by the initiates, and seized the reins of spiritual government.“Thus black magic dictated the state religion and paralysed the intellectual and spiritualactivities of the individual by demanding his complete and unhesitating acquiescence inthe dogma formulated by the priestcraft. The Pharaoh became a puppet in the hands ofthe Scarlet Council - a committee of arch-sorcerers elevated to power by the priesthood.”22The black magicians that Hall says were formerly in Atlantis were, for me, thereptilian-human hybrids of what I call the Babylonian Brotherhood. It is their secretsociety network that now spans the globe and operates in literally every country. Itallows the coordination of the Agenda across national borders and between apparentlyunconnected companies and institutions like politics, banking, business, the militaryand the media. Knowledge is not good nor bad, it just is. It is how we use thatknowledge that is positive or negative. At the upper levels of this network they knowof the true power of the Sun, magnetics and the mind; the effect of the planets onhuman behaviour; how to manipulate time, consciousness, energy, the weather and somuch more. If used malevolently, this knowledge can be incredibly destructive andmanipulating and this is what has happened. At the same time the reptilians have usedtheir secret societies to create institutions in the public arena such as religions andpolitical parties to suck this advanced knowledge out of circulation. The Inquisitionwas a wonderful example of this technique. Merely to speak about esoteric matterswas to sign your own death warrant. This scam has been so effective that still todayyou have Christians condemning esoteric information as ‘the Devil’ when this sameknowledge is the very foundation of their religion. If you want to know whereChristianity really came from, stick around. It is recycled Paganism and provably so.Yet Christianity has been used quite brilliantly as the major vehicle for removing vitalknowledge from the public domain. Whenever Christianity and other religions tookcontrol of a country or region, the ancient texts and records were removed ordestroyed. This took out of circulation the very knowledge the reptilians have used"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"58and still use to manipulate an ignorant population. It was also in the name ofChristianity that most of the accounts of the true history of humankind have beendestroyed, along with knowledge of the influence on human affairs of extraterrestrialraces, positive and negative. This allowed an alternative invented ‘history’ to be writtenwhich has delinked humanity from its origins. Controlling history is so importantbecause if you manipulate how people see what we call the past, you will influencemassively how they see the present.The themes I have highlighted so far, along with the deities and symbols, will travelwith us from here to the present day as we follow the expansion of the BabylonianBrotherhood across the world. Invariably, the Babylon reptilian full-bloods and hybridsmanipulated themselves into the positions of power and influence in the countrieswhere they settled. They had a much higher level of knowledge than most of the peopleand, as vehicles for the fourth dimensional reptilians, there was already a long term planto work to, the Great Work of Ages as it became known to the Freemasons. Theyallowed the non-reptilian population to do the work and then, when new societies wereestablished, the Brotherhood priests and initiates would hijack the positions of religiousand political power and ensure that any advanced knowledge in circulation was suckedout of the public domain and into their mystery schools and secret societies. The whiterace and the reptile-Aryan crossbreeds had emerged from the Caucasus Mountains andthe mountains of Iran and Kurdistan after the flood to settle in Egypt, Israel/Palestineand what we now call Jordan, Syria, Iraq, Iran and Turkey, going up to the CaucasusFigure 7:The Land of theGods in theancient worldfrom where theAryan andreptile-Aryanbloodstreamsemerged in theCaucasusMountains,Sumer; Babylon,and Egypt.There wereother advancedpeoples in otherparts of theworld, however,not only here."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"59Mountains (see Figure 7). Significantly it was from this same region that all the world’smajor religions emerged and this is no accident. In earlier times, the civilisations ofSumer, Babylon and Assyria were in the general area of what we call Iraq, while Turkeywas previously known as Asia Minor and Persia. Richard Laurence, the Archbishop ofCashel, who translated the first English edition of the Book of Enoch from theEthiopian, established from the descriptions of the longest day of the year, that theauthor of the text had to have lived in the Caucasus region and not Palestine, as mostpeople believed.23 This was where the main reptile-human bloodlines emerged from andthe original text of the Book of Enoch was the much older Book of Noah, the reptiliancrossbreed. The Aryan race as it expanded into new territory was known under variousnames, the most significant of which were the Hittites and Phoenicians. I think therewere definitely other Aryan settlements outside this region, possibly Britain amongthem, and certainly the reptilians were operating in other parts of the world, like theAmericas. But this mountainous region around the Caucasus and down to the plains ofSumer and Egypt is a key to the true history of humankind over the last seven thousandyears.The Caucasus Mountains came up again and again in my research and how appropriatethat in North America white people are known as ‘Caucasian’. Even according to officialhistory it was a white ‘Aryan’ race from the Caucasus Mountains region which movedinto the Indus Valley of India about 1550 BC and created what is today known as theHindu religion. It was this same Aryan race (they called themselves ‘Arya’) whichintroduced the ancient Sanskrit language to India and the stories and myths contained inthe Hindu holy books, the Vedas. L. A. Waddell, in his outstanding research into thisAryan race, established that the father of the first historical Aryan king of India (recordedin the Maha-Barata epic and Indian Buddhist history) was the last historical king of theHittites in Asia Minor.24 The Indian Aryans worshipped the Sun as the Father-god Indra,and the Hittite-Phoenicians called their Father-god Bel by the name, Indara.25 Undermany names this same Aryan people also settled in Sumer, Babylon, Egypt and AsiaMinor, now Turkey, and other Near Eastern countries, taking with them the same stories,myths, and religion. This is why, as we shall see in detail later, all the major religions tellthe same tale but using different names. They all come from the same source, this Aryanrace, which seems to have originated on Mars, and the reptile-human bloodlines operatingcovertly within them. What we call the Jewish race also originated in the Caucasus regionand not, as claimed, in Israel. Jewish historical and anthropological sources have shownthat only a few of the people known as Jewish have any genetic connection to Israel. Inthe 8th century a people called the Khazars living in the Caucasus Mountains andsouthern Russia had a mass conversion to the Jewish religion. Later when that empirefolded, these same people made their way north over a long period of time to settle inother parts of Russia, Lithuania and Estonia. From there they entered Western Europe andeventually the United States. The Rothschild family is one of these bloodlines. These arethe same people who justified the takeover of Arab Palestine after the last war by sayingthat ‘God’ had given them an ancient right to that land as his ‘chosen people’. In truth"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"60their original homeland is the Caucasus region and southern Russia, not Israel. See...And The Truth Shall Set You Free for a detailed and sourced account of this story andthe secret society manipulation that was behind the creation of Israel, or Rothschild-land as it really is.The white race expanded northwards into Europe. The first people went by sea underthe name, the Phoenicians, and over many centuries others migrated over land (seeFigure 8). Two of the latter groups were called the Cimmerians and the Scythians andthrough a series of name changes these same bloodlines populated Europe andreconnected with the earlier Aryan settlers of Britain and Northern Europe who hadbeen installed by the seafaring Phoenicians. The Phoenicians are crucial to the story andI will come to them in detail in a moment. The Cimmerians migrated north west fromthe Caucasus and Asia Minor (Turkey) into the countries we now call Belgium, theNetherlands, Germany and Denmark. The Roman historians, Pliny and Tacitus, said thatall the people along the coast from the Netherlands to Denmark were the same ethnicgroup and this is supported by archaeological evidence which indicates that this peoplearrived in that region about 300 to 250 BC. Another group of Cimmerians travelled upthe River Danube through Hungary and Austria into southern Germany and France. TheRomans called them Gauls and the Greeks knew them as the Keltoi or Celts. Groups ofthese Celtic tribes also settled in Bohemia and Bavaria and others invaded northernItaly. Sallust, the Roman historian, records how Romans were defeated a number ofFigure 8: The Aryans and the reptile-Aryans expanded by sea and land into Europe under many names, andespecially thanks to the ‘British’ Empire, they would eventually take over the wodd."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"61times by the ‘Cimbri’, who he says were Gauls. Other Roman historians say the Cimbriwere ‘Celts’. They were divided into three tribes, the Belgae (north east France), theGauls (central France) and the Acquitanae (southern France to the PyreneesMountains). By the second century BC, the Gauls/Celts (the white Cimmerians from theCaucasus Mountains and the Middle East) occupied all of central Europe and northernItaly and they went on to conquer the whole of that country. Around 280 BC they sweptdown into Asia Minor and reoccupied the lands of their ancestors. As the historianProfessor Henry Rawlinson said: “These two great invasions into Asia Minor proceededfrom the same identical race, in the first instance called the Cimmerians and in thesecond, the Gauls.”26 These invading Gauls based themselves in a place called Phrygiawhich became known as Galatia (Gaul-atia) and it was to these people that St Paul wassupposed to have written in the New Testament’s Letter to the Galatians. TheCimmerians or Cimbri also settled in Wales and to this day the name for that country inthe Welsh language is Cymru.The Scythians, another Aryan group, also moved north from the Caucasus intoEurope where their name was changed by the Romans to distinguish between them andother peoples. The sacred emblems of the Scythians included the serpent, the Ox(Nimrod/Taurus), fire (the Sun, knowledge), and Tho or Theo, the god the Egyptianscalled Pan. The Romans called the Scythians the Sarmatae and the Germani from theLatin word Germanus, meaning ‘genuine’. The Scythians were known, therefore, as the‘Genuine People’ and of course from Germani we get German and Germany. The namechange is confirmed by the writings of the Roman historians Pliny and Strabo. TheAnglo-Saxons who invaded Britain were also known as Germani by the Romans. Theland called Old Saxony is modern day north Germany and the Netherlands. Both theAngles and the Saxons came from the same genetic source -the white Cimmerians andScythians from the Caucasus and the Middle/Near East. It is the same with William theConqueror and his Normans, the last people to invade Britain in 1066 at the Battle ofHastings. The terms Norman and Normandy originate from the Norse (North) menbecause they came from Scandinavia to occupy that region of France. The story of theScandinavian hero Odin, says that he came from Asaland or Asaheim, which justhappens to be the lands of Scythia and can be identified in Aryan India. From there about200 to 300 AD, it is said, Odin led a huge army north to conquer Sweden. His army wascalled the Svear and in Swedish that country is still called Sverige, the Land of the Svear.Another group of Scythians, who became known as the Sakkas, went east from theCaucasus following the trail of the earlier Aryans and they reached the borders of China by175 BC. About this time Chinese records tell of a people called the Sai-wang or Sok-wangwho were forced to flee India. Sok-wang means ‘Sakka princes’. The records indicate thatthese Sakka retreated south into India through the mountain passes from Afghanistan, andcoins dating from about 100 BC confirm that a Sakka kingdom was created in the upperIndus valleys between Kashmir and Afghanistan. Again it is not a coincidence that thereligion of Buddhism emerged from lands occupied by the Sakka (Aryan Scythians). Atleast by 500 BC a tribe called the Sakyas lived in the area where Buddha is supposed to"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"62have been born around 63 years earlier. Guatma (Lord Buddha) was called Sakyashina,Sakamuni, the Sakya sage, Sakya the teacher and the lion of the tribe of Sakya. All thiswill become highly significant when we look at the single origin of all the major, andmost minor, religions and their ‘heroes’. The Scythian/Sakka and the Cimmerians/Cimbri were in fact all the same people and this is confirmed by inscriptions scored intothe Behistun Rock in the Zargos Mountains on an old caravan trail from Babylon. Theinscriptions were ordered by Darius the Great about 515 BC and they were written inthree languages, Babylonian, Elamite and Persian. Whenever the Elamite and Persianversions say Sakka, the Persians/Babylonians use the term Cimiri.So these white Aryan peoples under different names with their same religion andreligious heroes under different names, expanded from their origins in the Caucasus andthe Middle and Near East and went overland into Europe, India and as far as China.And within them were the reptile-human bloodlines who battled for, and eventuallywon, supremacy to control the course of events as the kings, queens, priests andmilitary leaders under the collective title I dub the Babylonian Brotherhood. That theBabylonians were part of the Aryan race is confirmed by ancient inscriptions and titles.The Kassi or Cassi was a title first used by the Phoenicians about 3,000 BC and thiswas adopted by the Babylonians who ruled the Mesopotamian empire. Kassi alsoappears as a personal name of Phoenicians in Egypt and Cassi was the inspiration forthe ruling kings known as Catti in pre-Roman Britain, one of whom minted ‘Cas’ coinsfeaturing the sun-horse and other solar symbols.27This Aryan expansion began as far back as 3,000 BC, probably earlier, with theirseafaring branch, the Phoenicians. They were a technologically advanced peoplewho have been marginalised by official history and this has obscured their trueidentity. They are fundamental to understanding where we have come from andwhere we are now. It was they who brought both their genetic lines and theirknowledge to Europe, Scandinavia and the Americas, thousands of years BC. Theirstory is told by L. A. Waddell in his book, The Phoenician Origin Of Britons, ScotsAnd Anglo-Saxons. Waddell was a fellow of the Royal Anthropological Institute andspent a lifetime researching the evidence. He shows that the Phoenicians were not aSemitic race as previously believed, but a white Aryan race. Examination ofPhoenician tombs reveals that they were a long-headed Aryan race and of a totallydifferent racial type to the Semites. The Phoenicians of the ancient world travelledby sea from their bases in Asia Minor, Syria and Egypt to settle in the islands of theMediterranean like Crete and Cyprus and also Greece and Italy. It was thePhoenicians who carried the knowledge which later emerged as the civilisations ofMinoan Crete, classic Greece and Roman Italy. They were also the ‘brains’ behindmuch of the Egyptian culture in this period, before it was hijacked by the reptilians.The Egyptians knew the Phoenicians as the Panag, Panasa and Fenkha. The Greekscalled them the Phoinik-as, and to the Romans they were the Phoenic-es.28 There is asimple reason why the Egyptians depicted many of their gods with white skin andblue eyes in exactly the same way as other cultures all over the world did. This"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"63advanced race, called the Phoenicians, were white skinned and often had blue eyes -the same as the reptilian-human crossbreeds and the same, it would appear, as the racefrom Mars. Thus we have the Scandinavian races, which were installed by thePhoenicians and other peoples of the same bloodstock and general location. It is alsothe origin of the Aryan ‘Master Race’ nonsense which obsessed the Nazis and the secretsocieties which created them. The hero of the Freemason secret society to this day is themythical Hiram Abif, the so-called builder of King Solomon’s Temple. Abif is supposedto have been a Phoenician. The grandfather of the famous Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten,the father of Tutankhamen, was a Phoenician high priest. The Phoenix, the mythicalbird of Egypt, was in fact the Sun bird of the Phoenicians, the emblem of the Sun God,Bil or Bel, and as it has been later symbolised, a peacock or an eagle.29 Evidence hasemerged in recent years about pyramids on Mars, when the NASA scientists, VincentDiPietro and Gregory Molenaar, discovered six enormous pyramids like those in Egyptin the Cydonia region of Mars.30 It would make sense that the same Martian race withthe same knowledge would also build pyramids when they came to Earth, and the samecan be said of the Anunnaki if, as Zecharia Sitchin speculates and I agree, they hadsettlements on Mars.The Phoenicians were not confined to the Mediterranean and the Middle East. Theylanded in Britain around 3,000 BC and unmistakable Phoenician artefacts have beenfound in Brazil, as well as possible Egyptian remains in the Grand Canyon in America.The Phoenicians landed in the Americas thousands of years before the manufactured‘photo opportunity’ better known as the journey of Christopher Columbus. The reasonthat the native legends of the Americas speak of tall ‘white gods’ coming from the seabringing advanced knowledge is because that is precisely what happened, if you forgetthe gods bit. They were the Aryan race and the reptile-Aryans from the east landing inthe Americas thousands of years ago, the same Aryan race or ‘gods’ who theSumerians said gifted them their civilisation after the flood. This is also why the laterwhite invaders who followed Columbus were astonished to find that the native peoplesof the American continent had the same basic religious stories and myths as they had.This is perfectly explainable now. They came from the same source - the Aryan raceknown as the Phoenicians among many other names like Sumerian and Hittite with thereptile-Aryan bloodlines within them. There also seems to have been a direct reptilianinvasion in the Americas way back. The evidence of an advanced race who knew theAmericas existed, comes with centuries-old maps like the Hadji Ahmed Portolan Map,compiled in 1519, which depicts the North American continent with a wide causewayconnecting Alaska and Siberia. There is also an accurate drawing of an ice-freeAntarctica.The arrival of the Aryan Phoenicians in Britain also corresponds with thebuilding of the great stone circles and observatories like Stonehenge and Avebury inWiltshire, although some researchers say they were built much earlier. Theadvanced Phoenicians-Sumerians, who had a highly developed knowledge ofastronomy, astrology, sacred geometry, mathematics and the Earth’s magnetic force"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"64line network known as the global energy grid, had all the knowledge necessary to buildthese great structures. L. A. Waddell said that he found Sumerian markings on one ofthe stones at Stonehenge.31 Professor Alexander Thom, Emeritus Professor ofEngineering Science at Oxford University from 1945 to 1961, discovered that theancients who built Stonehenge knew about ‘Pythagorean’ geometric and mathematicalprinciples thousands of years before Pythagoras was born. Thom explained in his 1967book, Megalithic Sites In Britain, that the stones not only formed geometric patterns inand around the circle, they also aligned to features in the surrounding landscape and tothe positions of the Sun, Moon and prominent stars at particular times, particularlywhere the Sun appeared or disappeared at the equinox or solstice and where the Moonwas at the extreme positions of its cycle. It was a gigantic astronomical clock, he said.But it is more than that. It is a receiver and transmitter of energy. The Earth’s magneticgrid, or grids, consist of lines of magnetic energy known as ley lines, meridians ordragon lines to the Chinese. Where these lines cross, the energy spirals into a vortexand where many lines cross you have a massive vortex of energy. These are the powerplaces, the sacred sites of the ancients who knew of this system. The vortex, or spiral, isa constant throughout the Universe. Our galaxy is a spiral, water spirals downwards,hair grows in a spiral at the crown, the DNA molecule which carries our geneticblueprint is a double spiral. Brian Desborough, my scientist friend from California, toldme there is a point on one of the Earth grids, the Hartmann Grid as it is called, wheretwelve of these force lines meet and go down into the Earth. Where was that? I asked.“A place called Avebury in England” he said. The very place the advanced Phoenician-Sumerians chose to build their stone circles at least five thousand years ago along witha series of surrounding sites, including Silbury Hill, the biggest human-made mound inEurope, and others like West Kennet Long Barrow. These form a sort of ‘circuit board’at the heart of the energy grid which fundamentally affects the nature of the Earth’smagnetic field. I lived near Avebury for two years and it is an incredibly powerful placeif you are sensitive to energy. It is also the area where most of the ‘crop circles’ or moreaccurately, crop formations, have appeared, particularly the most complex of them.Even more interesting is the apparent connection between Avebury and Mars.The best known researcher of the apparently man-made structure called the ‘Faceon Mars’ and an area of that planet known as Cydonia, is the American Richard C.Hoagland. He has been a science journalist, a director of planetariums in WestHartford and New York, and an advisor at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.Hoagland produces evidence in his book, Monuments On Mars,32 that the alleged‘face’ and the pyramids are part of a vast area built to align with the sunrise on theMartian summer solstice 500,000 years ago -50,000 years before the estimatedarrival on Earth of the Anunnaki. I have little doubt that the same race that built thestructures in Cydonia, including pyramids, also built Stonehenge and Avebury.There is evidence, in fact, that Avebury could be a mirror image of the complex atCydonia. When you take same scale topographical maps of both places andsuperimpose one on the other, the correlation of objects and the distances between"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"65them is incredibly similar, as members of Hoagland’s team established. He alsodiscovered that this ‘Mars City’ was built according to the same laws used to createother similar complexes on the Earth. The same mathematics, alignments and sacredgeometry can be found in Cydonia on Mars and in the great structures of the ancientworld like those at Stonehenge, the pyramids at Giza in Egypt, Teotihuacan in Mexicoand in Zimbabwe. These mathematics accord with the ‘Golden Mean’ geometry asdepicted by the Italian artist, Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519), in his picture of the maninside a circle (see Figure 9). Da Vinci, as we shall see, was a leading initiate of thesecret society network and this is how he was able to predict the coming of thetelephone, design flying machines and tanks, and design bicycles in the 15th and 16thcenturies which look basically like the modern version today.Another constant is the latitude of 19.5 degrees. This is the latitude on which thepyramids, many ancient temple complexes, and other sacred structures were built.It is also where you will find the volcanoes on Hawaii, the Schild volcanoes onFigure 9: Leonardo da Vinci’s depiction of Man according to the sacred geometry known as the Golden Mean."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"66Venus, the massive Olympus Mons volcano on Mars, the dark spot on Neptune, the redspot on Jupiter and the main area of sunspot activity, north and south, on the Sun.33 Thisall fits like a glove, because sunspots are emissions of incredibly powerfulelectromagnetic energy from the Sun, and volcanoes are obvious emissions of energyfrom the planets. Not surprisingly, therefore, 19.5 degrees is the point of energyexchange between rotating spheres and the hierarchy of the ancients knew this. TheSumerians knew, for instance, about the cycle of what is called precession. This is theeffect of the Earth’s ‘wobble’ which slowly moves the planet on its axis so that it facesdifferent star systems or astrological ‘houses’ over many thousands of years. As theirrecords show, the Sumerians knew that it took 2,160 years for the Earth to movethrough each ‘house’ and 25,920 years to complete the cycle - the period it also takesthe solar system to complete its journey around its galactic centre. We are completingone of these cycles now, hence the enormous change that is upon us. Ancient templesall over the world reflect these cycles of precession in their geometry and mathematics.Isn’t it amazing what ‘primitive’ people can do? The Elite of the Phoenician-Aryans hadenormous knowledge of the Earth’s energy grid and its potential to affect humanconsciousness. After all, we live within the planet’s magnetic field. When it changes,we change. If you live in water and the water changes, you are fundamentally affectedand it is the same with the energy ‘ocean’ that we occupy. Thus you have the movementof the planets affecting the Earth’s magnetic field and through that affecting us. TheBrotherhood don’t want us to know any of this and so they have used their religions,like Christianity, to condemn astrology as the work of the Devil and their ‘science’ todismiss it as mumbo-jumbo.The ‘mystery’ stone circles and structures are much less mysterious when you seekanswers with open minded research. The evidence strongly suggests that they were builtby the Phoenician-Aryans who came here from the Middle and Near East. It is the samewith the ‘mystery’ white horses scored into the chalk hillsides of Britain. Just before Iwrote this chapter, I visited the oldest white horse in Britain, the famous one atUffington in Wiltshire, not far from Avebury (see picture section). The plaque said thatits date of construction was about 3,000 BC - exactly the period when the Phoeniciansarrived in the British Isles. Why should the Phoenicians score white horses into thehillsides of Britain? Again, the answer is simple. Their religion was focused on the Sunand the white horse was a Phoenician symbol for the Sun. The great stone circles andstructures throughout Britain, like Stonehenge and Avebury, were built with theknowledge held by the ruling and priestly classes of the Phoenicians and theBabylonian Brotherhood which infiltrated and eventually controlled the Aryanleadership. This knowledge included the ability to use sound and other techniques tothrow a magnetic field around a massive stone and delink it from the laws of gravity. Itthen becomes weightless. This period of around 3,000 BC is very significant. While thePhoenicians were at work in this period in Britain and elsewhere, the pyramids at Gizain Egypt have also been dated to around 3,000 BC using the latest carbon datingmethods. Traces of charcoal found within the mortar apparently made this possible.34"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"67The Aryans of the Near and Middle East had many names, the Hittites, the Phoenicians,the Goths and so on. You can follow words and names through these apparently differentcultures to show that they came from the same source. Some of the stone circles aresometimes called Hare-Stones which, according to L. A. Waddell’s research, evolvedthrough Harri or Heria, the title for the ruling Goths, and from the Hittite title of Harri, Arrior Aryan: Hare stones are Aryan stones. Just as Han Khrishna means Aryan Khrishna, veryappropriate given that the Hindu religion was the work of the Aryans. You also haveCastlerigg stone circle near Keswick in Cumberland. The word ‘rig’ was a title for Gothickings and princes and the Gothic came from the Aryans. Ancient depictions of Aryan kingsin Cilicia have them wearing the Gothic style of dress. The name of Keswick itself means‘Abode of the Kes’ - the Cassi or Khatti clan of the Hittites - and the county ofCumberland has evolved throughnames like Cymry and Cumbersfrom its origin, Sumer. The termAryan comes from a Phoenicianword, Arri, meaning ‘noble one’.Thus we get the names Sum-ARIANand aristocracy or ARIAN-stock-racy. The lion has always beena major symbol through the agesbecause it was an Aryan symbol forthe Sun and was often placed at theentrances to temples and sacredplaces. Hence the lion-bodiedSphinx which also relates to theastrological sign of Leo, againconsidered in astrology to be thesign ruled by the Sun. The wholefoundation of ‘British’ culture andlegend came from the Phoenicians.The famous legend of St George andthe Dragon comes from St Georgeof Cappadocia, the Phoeniciancentre in Asia Minor. The battlesbetween St George and the dragon could well have been symbolic of the Martian-reptilianconflicts which seem to go back a very long way. The red cross of St George (England)and the crosses of St Andrew (Scotland) and St Patrick (Ireland), and the ensigns ofScandinavia, were all carried as sacred standards of victory by the Phoenicians. The redcross was the fire cross, a Phoenician-Aryan symbol for the Sun, as was the swastika, laterused by the Nazis. A swastika can be seen on a stone dedicated to the Phoenician Sun-godBel, which was found at Craig-Narget in Scotland and was used to decorate the robes oftheir high priestesses (see Figures 10 and 11). I read that the name swastika comes fromFigure 10: The swastika, the Phoenician sun symbol, on thePhoenician Craig-Narget stone in Scotland and, Figure 11, onthe robe of a Phoenician High Priestess."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"68the Sanskrit word, svasti, which means well-being, and it was considered a positivesymbol until the Nazis turned it around and made it a symbol of destruction. L. A.Waddell translated the markings on another stone in Scotland, the Newton Stone in theDumfries and Galloway region, to be Phoenician-Hittite and dedicated to their Sun god,Bel or Bil. The classic British symbol of Britannia comes from the Phoenician goddess,Barati. Look at how the Phoenicians depicted Barati and how the British depictBritannia in Figure 12! One of the major centres of the Aryan-Hittite-Phoenicians wasCilicia in Asia Minor and here Barati was worshipped as Perathea and later Diana. SoDiana and Britannia originatefrom the same source. Baratiwas the queen/goddess figure ofthe Phoenicians as Barat was thegod/king. These are possiblynames for the Babylonian deitiesNimrod and Semiramis. The‘royal’ elite clan of the Aryanswere (are) called the Barats andthis is why you find the termBarat or Brihat in the ancientIndian culture as you do withBritain and British (Barat-ainand Barat-ish). The Indian Vedassay that “King Barat gave hisname to the Dynastic Race of which he was the founder; and so it is from him that thefame of that Dynastic people hath spread so wide.”35 Parat, Prat and Prydi, are some ofthe other derivatives of Barat. The original form was Barat-ana or Brithad-ana.36 Thesuffix ana in Hittite-Sumerian (Aryan) means ‘one’. Ana in fact evolved into theEnglish word ‘one’ and the Scottish ‘ane’. Barat-ana or Briton therefore means ‘One ofthe Barats’ (Bruits). It is the same with many other countries occupied by this whiterace. The name Iran comes from the earlier Airy-Ana or Air-an, which means Land ofthe Arrays or Aryans.37The Indian Vedas also acknowledge the goddess Barati (Belonging to the Barats), andshe was known as Brihad the Divine. They say her special place was on the Saras-vatiRiver which happens to be the modern Sarus River in the Hittite-Phoenician land of Cilicia.The river entered the sea at Tarsus, the alleged home of St Paul in the New Testament, awork written in accordance with Aryan sun myths. Also, these Phoenicians and Aryansworshipped the serpent and the shape-shifting reptilians called the Nagas were the serpentgods of the Hindus. The Vedas, inspired by the Aryans, tell how the serpent-humans, theNagas, could cause fantastic damage and instant death. The Nagas were also said to haveappeared at the birth of the man who became known as Buddha and the serpent plays a partin the legend of Khrishna. The Roman name for Barati was Fortune after her legend as thegoddess of fortune. They depicted Fortune in the same way as the Phoenicians symbolisedFigure 12: The Phoenician depiction of Barati (right) and the Britishsymbol of Britannia. They are the same deity and alternative namesfor Queen Semiramis in Babylon and Isis in Egypt."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"69Barati and the British do with Britannia. All were associated with water as you expectwith a sea-faring race like the Phoenicians. The Egyptians, too, had a goddess calledBirth, the goddess of the waters, and she was another mirror of Barati because theAryan-Phoenicians were the force behind Egypt. Birth was described by a Babylonianemperor about 680 BC as “a Phoenician god across the sea”38 In Crete, anotherPhoenician centre under the title ‘Minoan’, their goddess was Brito-Martis. She was aPhoenician goddess according to Greek and Roman legend (Barati in other words) andthe divine daughter of Phoenix, the king of Phoenicia. Brito-Martis became identifiedwith the goddess Diana, a major deity of the ancient world, and like her she was armedfor the hunt. As Earl Spencer made a point of emphasising at the funeral of his sisterDiana, Princess of Wales, she was named after the ancient goddess of hunting.The early British kings called themselves and their race the ‘Catti’ and this appearson their coins. The Aryan Hittites of Asia Minor and Syria-Phoenicia called themselvesthe Catti or Khatti. The race of Aryans who left the Caucasus to rule India were knownas the Khattiyo. The term Khatti evolved through the Hebrew and English translationsinto the Hittites of the Old Testament. Kassi or Cassi was the title used by the firstPhoenician dynasty about 3,000 BC and was adopted by the Babylonian dynasty. Notsurprising because these were different branches of the same people. The ancient IndianEpic king lists name some of the same people named in the Mesopotamian king listsand the predynastic civilisers of early Egypt also turn out to be of the Aryan race. Weare looking at the same people here, no doubt whatsoever, and within this race are thereptile-Aryan bloodlines which have increasingly held the reins of power from theancient world to the present day. As L. A. Waddell points out, the English, Scottish,Irish, Gaelic, Welsh, Gothic and Anglo-Saxon languages and their writing, and theentire family of Aryan languages, derive from the Aryan Phoenician language via theHittite and Sumerian. About half of the commonest words used in the so-called Englishlanguage today are of Sumerian, Cyprian or Hittite origin with the same sound andmeaning. Sumerian, the language of the ‘gods’, is the parent language for most of theworld, although I think it originated somewhere else even further back in history,maybe Atlantis or even the area today called the British Isles. As Waddell says:“I had recognised that the various ancient scripts found at or near the old settlements ofthe Phoenicians, and (those known as) Cyprian, Karian, Aramaic or Syrian, Lykian, Lydian,Corinthian, lonian, Cretan or “Minoan”, Pelasgian, Phrygian, Cappadocian, Cilician,Theban, Libyan, Celto-Iberian, Gothic Runes etc, were all really local variations of thestandard Aryan Hitto-Sumerian writing of the Aryan Phoenician mariners, those ancientpioneer spreaders of the Hittite Civilisation along the shores of the Mediterranean and outbeyond the Pillars of Hercules to the British Isles.”39Official history asks us to believe that the people of Britain were savages who were‘civilised’ only after the Romans came. This is not true and in fact the Romans said theopposite. Roman records say that the Britons were generally civilised and their customs"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"70much the same as the Gauls. Of course they were. They were the same people with thesame origins. The Britons used gold money and there was trade with the Europeancontinent, as British coins of the period found there have confirmed. It was only thepeople of the interior of Britain, still uninfluenced by the Phoenician culture closer tothe coasts, whom the Romans regarded as uncivilised when they arrived. Many of theroads regarded as ‘Roman’ were not built by the Romans at all. They were pre-Romanroads which they repaired. The Romans admired the efficiency of the British armies,particularly their use of war chariots. You won’t be surprised to know by now that thesefamous ‘British’ chariots were the same as those used by the Hittites or Catti describedby the Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses II around 1,295 BC at the Battle of Kadesh, a Hittite-Phoenician port. In about 350 BC, three centuries before the Romans arrived, theexplorer and scientist, Pytheas, sailed around Britain and mapped the land scientificallywith latitudes. Pytheas was a native of Phocca in Asia Minor, Phocca deriving fromPhoenicia, as did an adjoining port called Phoenice.40 By this time the Phoenicians hadorganised the tin trade, from their mines in Cornwall in the west of England acrossGaul/France to Marseilles, from where it was taken by sea to the lands of theMediterranean and Aegean. The first Phoenician tin-port in Cornwall was Ictis or StMichael’s Mount in Penzance Bay. St Michael, one of the great heroes of Christianity,was in truth a Phoenician deity.There is endless evidence to prove the ancient link between the British Isles andIreland and the culture of North Africa and the Near East. They say if you want toexpose corruption, follow the money. Well if you want to identify the passage of peopleand cultures, follow the language. The Irish language today is English which replacedGaelic and Gaelic itself evolved from a now lost earlier language. Gaelic speakingmissionaries in the Middle Ages had to use interpreters to communicate with the Picts,the ancient people of what became Scotland, and Cormac, a Gaelic-speaking Irish kingof the ninth century, referred to the language of the people of Munster in south westIreland as the ‘iron language’. But even Gaelic connects us very firmly into the MiddleEast. In Conamara, in the west of Ireland, is a community which still speaks Gaelic asits first language. Their sean-nos (old style) singing, the basis of all Irish music, isamazingly similar to the native songs of the Middle East. Even trained ears find italmost impossible to distinguish between the chants of the Gaelic singers and those ofLibyans. Charles Acton, the music critic of the Irish Times, wrote:“If one listened for hours in the desert of an evening to Bedoum Arabs singing narrativeepics... and then returned to Ireland and heard a fine sean-nos singer using the same melismata and rhythm, one finds the resemblance almost uncanny. So, too, if one listens to(the Spanish) “canto jondo” 41There were major sea trading routes between Ireland and Spain and Spain andNorth Africa in ancient times through which the passage of bloodlines,knowledge and culture was transported. The Spanish Arch in Galway in the west"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"71of Ireland commemorates this, as does the Conamara dancing known as ‘thebattering’ which is virtually the same as Spanish Flamenco. The stick dance performedby the Wexford Mummers in Ireland is of North African origin. The word ‘mummer’comes from Mohammedan. The Irish symbol, the harp, came from North Africa and sodid the name of that other classic symbol of Ireland, the shamrock. Any three leaf plantis known in Egypt as a shamrukh. The rosary beads, the symbol of devout RomanCatholics, come from the Middle East and are still used by the Egyptians. The word‘nun’ is Egyptian and their garments are from the Middle East. According to Arbois deJuvainville, the author of a work called Cours De Literature Celtigue, the Irish wereknown as ‘Egyptians’ in the Middle Ages. There are obvious connections between Irishbooks and those of the Egyptians. They employ the same styles of illustration and thecolours used in the Irish Book of Kells and Book of Durrow are of Mediterraneanorigin. The red used in these books came from a Mediterranean insect, theKermococcus vermiho, and others came from a Mediterranean plant, the Crozophoratinctoria. The crossed arms pose of many Egyptian portrayals of their god, Osiris, canbe seen in Irish manuscripts. The Irish sweaters made on the Isle of Arran carry,according to at least one expert on the history of knitting, designs first given to them byEgyptian Coptic monks.42 The main blood group of Arran (Aryan?) is different frommost of the Irish population. The old Irish sailing craft called pucan was invented by theNorth Africans and used on the Nile. Excavations at Navan Fort, near Armagh City,found remains of the Barbary ape estimated to have lived about 500 BC. The Barbaryape today is mainly associated with Gibraltar, but its home in 500 BC was North Africa.Libyan dragonskins (mercenaries) were believed to have been at large in Ireland 2,000years ago. In the second century, the geographer Ptolemy, who lived in Alexandria,could name sixteen tribes in Ireland. The Irish sport of hurling is mirrored by the gamecalled Takourt in Morocco. Irish ritual was, like all the cultures inspired by thePhoenician-Aryans, focused on the Sun. The Earth mound at Newgrange in Ireland hasa narrow passageway of some 62 feet which is perfectly aligned with the Sun as it riseson December 2lst/22nd, the winter solstice. So much so that the golden sunlight fillsand illuminates the whole passage and the chamber at the centre. The entrance tostructures in the Mediterranean, particularly the one at the Palace of Minos in Crete, arethe same. The distinctive Round Towers of Ireland are, according to some orientalists,of Phoenician origin.43 Again all this fits perfectly into the story I am revealing here.The Phoenicians came from the Middle and Near East, one of the global centres for theAnunnaki-reptilians and, according to the research of Professor Phillip Calahan Imentioned earlier, the round towers are aligned with stars systems in the northern sky -especially Draco.The connections between Ireland and the Berbers of Morocco deserves a specialmention. They are a light-skinned mountain people, some blue-eyed and blond-haired. They are associated with the Atlas Mountains which are themselves associatedwith Atlantis and named after Atlas, a son of the legendary ruler of Atlantis,Poseidon. Berber art has many similarities to the Irish version and anyone speaking"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"72Gaelic could comfortably understand the Berber tongue. The main Berber clans likeM’Tir, M’Tuga and M’Ghill, are obvious origins or derivatives of the Ireland-ScottishMacTier, MacDougal and MacGhill. The term Mac means ‘children or child of’ and theArabs use the term Bini, as in Bini M’Tir, which means the same. Missionaries whofirst explored the lands of the Berbers found that they used bagpipes, as do the Irish andScots. Early invaders of Ireland were known as the men with the leather bags. An Irishgoatskin drum found in Kerry is a twin of the Moroccan drum, the bindir. The violinand the guitar also originate in North Africa. The Viking wing of the Aryans invadedIreland and founded many towns, including the present capital city of Dublin. But, notsurprisingly in the light of the evidence you have been reading, the famous Vikinggalley with the high front and stern was a Phoenician design used by the Egyptians.Rock carvings at Newgrange appear to depict this design thousands of years earlier. Thename Idris is well known in Wales and the saints and kings of the Muslims have beencalled Idris for centuries. In the British Museum is a Muslim coin, a gold dinar, whichhas the name ‘Offa’ stamped upon it. Offa was the King of Mercia in England in the 8thcentury and he is said to have built the 120 mile earth ‘wall’ between England andWales known as Offa’s Dyke. The name Wales comes from ‘Weallas’ meaning Land ofForeigners. The Welsh, like the Irish, explored the northern waters around Icelandbefore the Vikings and it is said that the Welshman Prince Madoc went ashore inAmerica three centuries before Columbus. That’s very possible because if he had accessto the knowledge of the Phoenicians, he would have known that the Americas werethere. The Venerable Bede of Cymbri (approximately the Welsh) said they were anEastern people who migrated after the flood from the lands of the Bible to the BritishIsles.44When the Irish settled in parts of Wales and Cornwall, some of the displaced peoplemoved to Armorica, now Brittany, on the French coast. There you find the fantasticforest of standing stones called Carnac, a name which comes from Karnac in Egypt.The Breton language is a mixture of old Welsh and Cornish - Aryan. Brittany meansLittle Britain and relates again to Barat and Barati. Amorica means ‘land facing thesea’, a perfect description of America approached from the Atlantic. This is surely thetrue origin of the name America, and not Amerigo Vespucci, the explorer from Florencewho was the contractor for Christopher Columbus in Spain. The Isle of Man was alsopopulated by the Irish Aryans and it became a very sacred land. It was one of twoplaces in Britain, Anglesea in North Wales was other, where the Arch Druids werebased. These were the highest ranked members of the ancient British priestly class, whoinherited their knowledge from the Phoenicians and later the Babylonian Brotherhood.The Isle of Man’s three legs symbol is not unlike that ancient Phoenician symbol for theSun, the swastika. Irish connections with Ethiopia have also been identified. AnAmerican researcher, Winthrop Palmer Boswell, wrote a book called Irish Wizards InThe Woods Of Ethiopia in which she showed the similarities between Irish andEthiopian folk stories. The baobab tree is held in great reverence by Ethiopians andBerbers and ‘banba’ is an old name for Ireland."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"73This reverence for trees in North Africa was expressed in the British Isles andEurope by the Druids and the giant or Titan race, the reptilian-human crossbreeds ofthe ancient Near East, were often symbolised as trees because of their height. In his1833 book, Phoenician Ireland, Joachim de Villeneuve, insisted that Irish Druidswere the ‘snake priests’ of the Phoenician seafarers. This would certainly explain theorigin of the Balor of the Evil Eye, the Irish version of the North African god Baal,and the celebration in May of the Baal ritual, Beltane. The evil eye relates to thehypnotic stare of the reptilians. The Sun god of the Phoenicians was Bel or Bil andlater became known by the Canaanites and Babylonians as Baal - Nimrod. TheDruids became the carriers of the mystery school tradition in Britain, Ireland andFrance or Britannia, Eire and Gaul as they were then called, and some of thembecame deeply corrupted by the influence of the reptile-human bloodlines of theBabylonian Brotherhood which established control of the Aryan priesthood as thecenturies passed. The origin of the word Druid is not certain. A Gaelic word, druidh,means ‘a wise man’ or a ‘sorcerer’, but it may come from the Irish word, Drui, whichmeans ‘men of the oak trees’.45 The Druidic Mysteries were taught in the darkness ofcaves, forests and groves with the oak tree symbolising their Supreme Deity (verymuch in line with the Watcher tree-symbolism). They did not worship the oak tree, itwas a symbol and anything which grew upon it, like mistletoe, became sacred. Theholly bush was another sacred symbol of the Druids and this is where we get thename Hollywood in Los Angeles, the centre of the global film industry which wascreated by modern initiates of the Babylonian Brotherhood. It has remained in theircontrol and Hollywood is one of their most important vehicles for mass mindconditioning. Hollywood is indeed a place of magic as it casts a spell on humanity’sperception of itself and the world. The Druids knew about astrology and astronomyand they celebrated the birth of the Sun on December 25th. The Moon was also veryimportant to them. Particularly sacred was the night of the new Moon, the sixth day,and the full Moon.As with the Blue Degrees of modern Freemasonry, the Druid initiates were dividedinto three groups. The teachings given to each level in the forest groves of ancient timesand the Freemasonic temples of today are virtually the same. The first level of the DruidSchool was the Ovate who was dressed in green, the Druidic colour for learning. Thesecond was the Bard, who wore sky blue representing harmony and truth. They had thetask of memorising some of the 20,000 verses of Druidic poetry within which themysteries were hidden. The third, the Druid, would be dressed in a white robe, theirsymbolic colour for purity and the Sun. To become an Arch-Druid, a spiritual leader,you had to pass six levels of degree. The Druids had total power over the population fora long time and some deeply unpleasant rituals emerged after their mystery schoolnetwork was taken over by the Babylonian Brotherhood. The basic moral code wastaught to all people, but the secret knowledge was, as with all these networks, preservedfor initiates under the strictest secrecy. Eliphas Levi, the famous esotericist, said of theirhealing methods:"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"74“The Druids were priests and physicians, curing by magnetism... Their universal remedieswere mistletoe and serpent’s eggs, because these substances attract astral light in aspecial manner. The solemnity with which mistletoe was cut down drew upon this plant thepopular confidence and rendered it powerfully magnetic.”46The Druids, like the other mystery religions, were carriers of advanced knowledgewhich has been kept from the people, and some of them used it for less than positivereasons. I am not condemning the Druids as a whole and I certainly do not wish to casta negative interpretation on the work of modern Druids. Knowledge is neutral and thesame knowledge can be used with good or malevolent intent. But there is no doubt thatthe Druidic religion was infiltrated and began to manifest the classic rituals andbehaviour of the reptilians, including human sacrifice. The Brotherhood today still usesDruidic rituals in its own black magic ceremonies.Going home?The evidence of the connections between the Middle-Near East and the British Islesand Ireland is simply enormous. You can follow the flow of peoples, knowledge,culture, language, deities, symbols and rituals, very comfortably. I wonder, however, ifthis was all travelling between these two areas of the world for the first time fromaround 3,000 BC or whether, in the ancient past before the Venus cataclysm, it had allgone in the reverse direction. Could it be that the origins of the Middle-Near Eastcultures had actually been in what became the British Isles and Europe, and after 3,000BC it was taken in the reverse direction. I can’t present detailed evidence of this at themoment, but my research is moving that way. If the British Isles and parts of Europewere badly affected by Earth upheavals, maybe there was a mass movement of theadvanced race from many parts of the world to safer lands, particularly in the Near East.Certainly, the Babylonian Brotherhood and others with advanced knowledge were verykeen to make their way to Britain and establish their headquarters there. Londonbecame the epicentre of their operations and it remains so to this day. There must be avery important reason for that and I think it relates to the energy fields in these lands.The British Isles is a really sacred place to the Brotherhood because it is the centre ofthe Earth’s energy grid. It is not without reason that there is a greater concentration ofstone circles, standing stones, ancient mounds and sites, in areas of Britain than inalmost anywhere else in the world. Those who understand how to manipulate energyand consciousness would seek to base their activities at the heart centre of the planetaryenergy grid and they have done this by operating so much of their Agenda from theBritish Isles.London is also a major site on the Earth’s magnetic grid and it became the capitalnot only of Britain or Barat-land, but also of the Babylonian Brotherhood. To them, it istheir ‘New Troy’ or ‘New Babylon’. The city of Troy in Asia Minor, the place madefamous by the Trojan Wars and the Wooden Horse legend, was another Aryan centre. Itwas the old capital of the Hittites. Many of the reptile-Aryan bloodlines appear to have"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"75been based in Troy and it remains a sacred place for those at the upper levels of thesecret society network who are aware of their true origins. Troy or Troia means ‘threeplaces’ in Greek and Hebrew, an allusion to the trinity, another belief that Christianityhas stolen from the ancient world. In English, Troy or Troia is Tripoli, the name of thecapital of Libya today and home to that Brotherhood frontman, Colonel Gaddafi. Onceagain, Troy relates to the extraterrestrial full-bloods and crossbreeds, hence the constantobsession with that name by the Brotherhood. In the Iliad epic, believed to have beenwritten by the Greek poet, Homer, it states that Troy was founded by Dardanus, the sonof the Greek god Zeus, who was a Titan - the reptilian bloodline. Zeus was depicted asboth an eagle and a serpent. He was said to have been born in Arcadia, in Sparta, andafter the Trojan War many Spartans migrated into what is now France. Terms like ‘NewTroy’, therefore, relate to centres for these same bloodlines.Most people don’t realise that London was founded as the ‘New Troy’. After thedestruction of Troy around 1,200 BC, the story goes that Aeneas, born of a royalbloodline, fled with the remnants of his people and settled in Italy. There he married thedaughter of Latinus, the king of the Latins, and through this line later emerged theRoman Empire. According to many traditions, the grandson of Aeneas, a man calledBrutus, landed in Britain around 1,103 BC with a group of Trojans, including somefrom colonies in Spain. They referred to Britain as the ‘Great White Island’ after thewhite cliffs which abound on the South Coast. In the south west of England is the townof Totnes in Devon, a short distance inland from Torbay, the oldest seaport in the area.Here there is a stone called the Brutus Stone on which, the legend says, the formerTrojan prince stood after he first landed. Welsh records say that Brutus was met by threetribes of Britons who proclaimed him king. Brutus founded a city he called ‘Caer Troia’- New Troy. The Romans would later call it Londinium. London became the operationalcentre of the empire of the Babylonian Brotherhood, and it still is, along with Paris andthe Vatican. In the King Arthur stories, London or New Troy, is Troynavant, KingArthur’s eastern gateway city and King Arthur’s Camelot apparently means MartianCity or City of Mars. Artefacts discovered by the German archaeologist, HeinrichSchliemann, at the site of ancient Troy, contained many of the markings found onBritish megalithic stones. They were also decorated with the swastika, the Phoenician-Aryan symbol of the Sun. Once again, they were the same people. All the white peoplesare and it is the white race which has taken over the world, quite demonstrably. Justlook around you at who controls all the reigns of global power. White people.And within this race and others, going back to antiquity, are the reptile bloodlineswho are today centred on London, New Troy, or more appropriately New Babylon. Thebodies of these Elite bloodlines are occupied or controlled by the reptiles of the lowerfourth dimension and most of the lesser Aryan hierarchy have no idea that this is so.Iwill focus on this reptilian-Anunnaki network and chart it into the modern world whenwe have considered the truth about the religions which the reptilians have used soeffectively to batter the human race into mental, emotional and spiritual submission."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"76SOURCES1Brian Desborough, The Great Pyramid Mystery.2Ibid.3Ibid.4Ibid.5Ibid.6Geoffrey Higgins, Anacalypsis (first published 1836, republished in 1972 by Health Research,P0 Box 850, Pomeroy, WA, USA 99347), volume I, p 368.7The Great Pyramid Mystery8Ibid.9Ibid.10Ibid.11Ibid.12Ibid.13Ibid.14Ibid.15Ibid.16First Book of Enoch, 7:2-6.17The Universe (Life National Picture Library, Time-Life International, Netherlands, 1964), pp 85-94.18Ibid.19Ibid.20Adrian G.

Still today in Americareligion controls the minds and limits the thinking of the Christian patriot movementwhich has seen through many other smokescreens and identified many aspects of theBrotherhood conspiracy. What they cannot face, however, is that their own religion is amassive part of that conspiracy.That is not to condemn all people who call themselves Christian. There are many whoexpress a loving spirituality through their Christian beliefs. I am talking of the institutionof Christianity and its arrogant indoctrination and imposition of its desperately limitedvision of life which has created a mind-prison for literally billions of people over almost2,000 years. All the world’s major religions, Hinduism, Christianity, Judaism and Islam,came out of the very same region of the Middle and Near East from which the Aryanrace and the reptile crossbreeds emerged after the cataclysm of perhaps 7,000 years ago.These religions were designed to imprison the mind and engulf the emotions with fearand guilt. They were usually based on some ‘saviour-god’ figure like Jesus orMohammed and only by believing in them and following their dictates can we find‘God’ and be saved. That is precisely what the Babylonian priests said about Nimrodwhen the blueprint for control-by-religion was being moulded in Babylon. Those whorefuse to believe this hogwash are condemned to stoke the fires of hell for all eternity.Staggeringly, billions upon billions have fallen for this scam over thousands of years,and still do. That’s fine if they want to give their minds and their lives away, but manyinsist that everyone else must do the same and that’s not fine. Seriously not fine. Most ofthe people reading this book will be from the parts of the world dominated byChristianity and Judaism and so I shall take those as the main examples of how symbolicstories have become literal truths and how the manipulation of these stories has producedthe most powerful form of mass mind control yet invented.To understand the true background to the religions, we need to appreciate the basisof all ancient religion going back to the Phoenicians, the Babylonians and beyond. Itwas the Sun. The hierarchy focused on the Sun because, as I outlined earlier, theyunderstood its true power as an amazing generator of electromagnetic energy which isaffecting our lives and behaviour every second of every day The Sun contains 99% ofthe mass of this solar system. Just think about that. The Sun is the solar system andwhen it changes, we change. Understanding these Sun cycles, and the changing natureof the energy it projects, allows you to anticipate how human beings are most likely to"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"79react to various events at different times. As with the texts that form the basis of thevarious religions, there are two levels of knowledge in Sun worship. In the ancientworld, the hierarchy focused on the Sun because they knew its effect at a deep level,while the masses worshipped the Sun because its heat and light had an obvious andcrucial role in ensuring an abundant harvest. In the same way, an initiate of the esotericknowledge will read the Bible differently to a Christian or Jewish believer. The initiatewill recognise the symbolism, the numerology and the esoteric codes, while the believertakes the text literally So the same text acts as a means of passing on esotericknowledge to the initiated and creates a prison-religion for the masses who are notinitiated. Great scam.To understand the ancient Sun symbolism is to understand the major religions. In theancient world they used one particular symbol (see Figure 13) for the Sun’s journeythrough the year. As we will see in a later chapter, this is still a fundamental symbolused by the Babylonian Brotherhood. It symbolised both the Phoenician depictions ofBarati and was on the shield of her British expression, Britannia. The ancients took thecircle of the zodiac (a Greek word meaning animal circle) and inserted a cross to markthe four seasons. At the centre of the cross, they placed the Sun. So many of the pre-Christian deities were said to have been born on December 25th because of thissymbolism. On December 2lst-22nd, you have the winter solstice when, in the northernhemisphere, the Sun is at the lowest point of its power in the annual cycle. The Sun, theancients said, had symbolically ‘died’. By December 25th, the Sun had demonstrablyFigure 13: The ancient symbol forthe annual cycle of the Sun fromwhich so many symbols andsymbolic stories haveoriginated. You can see thissymbol in the depictions ofBarati and Britannia inFigure 12."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"80begun its symbolic journey back to the summer and the peak of its power. The ancients,therefore, said that the Sun was ‘born’ on December 25th. The Christian Christmas ismerely a renamed Pagan festival, as indeed are all Christian festivals. Easter is another.About March 25th, the old fixed date for Easter, the Sun enters the astrological sign ofAries the ram or the lamb. At this time the ancients used to sacrifice lambs because theybelieved this would appease the gods, most notably the Sun god, and ensure abundantharvests. In other words they believed that the blood of the lamb would mean that theirsins would be forgiven.In ancient Babylon, Tammuz, the son of Queen Semiramis, was said to have beencrucified with a lamb at his feet and placed in a cave. When a rock was rolled away fromthe cave’s entrance three days later, his body had disappeared. I’ve definitely heard thatsomewhere before. The ancients also symbolised the Sun as a baby in December, a youthat Easter, a strapping, immensely strong, man in the summer, an ageing man losing hispower in the autumn, and an old man by the winter solstice. The modern depiction ofOld Father Time is a version of this. They also symbolised the Sun as having long goldenhair (sun rays) which got shorter as he lost his power in the months of autumn. Now lookagain at the Old Testament story of Samson -Sam-sun. He was incredibly strong and hadlong hair, but he lost his power when his hair was cut. The problems started when heentered the House of Delilah - the astrological house of Virgo, the virgin, through whichthe Sun passes as autumn approaches. Summoning his last burst of power, Sam-the-Sun,pushes down the two pillars, which are classic Brotherhood symbolism going back atleast to ancient Egypt and are still used by the Freemasons today. Samson is Sam Sun - asymbolic story of the Sun’s annual cycle. There wasn’t any such person. In Hebrew,Samson means I understand, the God of the Sun.To the orthodox Christian, Jesus is the only begotten Son of God who died so oursins could be forgiven. But you will find exactly the same claims for a stream of ‘gods’in the ancient world long before the name of ‘Jesus’ was even heard of. Indeed, weknow his name wasn’t Jesus because that’s a Greek translation of a Hebrew name. Theterm Son of God would seem to originate at least as far back as the Aryan Gothic kingsof Cilicia who took the title ‘Son of the Sun God’, a tradition adopted by the Pharaohsof Egypt.1 To many in the New Age, Jesus is Sananda, a high initiate of some spiritualhierarchy who incarnated to infuse the Earth with the ‘Christ’ energy. Or, depending onwho you talk to, he was an extraterrestrial on a similar mission. To others he wasclaiming to be the King of the ‘Jews’ by right of his King David bloodline. But didJesus actually exist? Did Moses, Solomon and King David exist? I would saycategorically no. There is no credible evidence for the existence of any of them outsidethe biblical texts and they are certainly not credible. So where did they come from?The Old TestamentIn 721 BC, it appears that Israel was overrun by the Assyrians and the Israelites orCanaanites were taken into captivity. However, the tribes known by official history asJudah and Benjamin, survived for more than a hundred years after that, before they"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"81were conquered and captured by our friends, the Babylonians, in around 586 BC. It wasin Babylon, that ancient capital city of the reptile-Aryan priesthood and hierarchy, thatthe Hebrew priests, the Levites, began to create a manufactured history which obscuredthe truth of what really happened. I mean, ask yourself, is a Brotherhood who arrangedfor the destruction of ancient knowledge and libraries all over the world going to writedown the true history in their texts or are they going to produce the version they wantthe people to believe? During and after their stay in Babylon, with its wealth ofinherited knowledge and stories from Sumer, the Levites mixed truth, often symbolictruth, with fantasies and this concoction became the foundations of the Old Testament.The so-called Israelites did not write these texts or agree with what they said. Even ifyou accept they even existed, the Israelites had long dispersed by the time the Levitesinked their pens. Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers, which together make up the‘Jewish’ Torah, were all written by the Levites or under their supervision during or aftertheir period in Babylon. This bunch of human sacrificing, blood drinking fanatics andblack magicians, who you would not trust to tell you the time, compiled the law whichJewish people to this day are supposed to follow. Likewise many Christian fanaticsquote this stuff as the word of God! It is not the word of God, it is the word of theLevites under the direction of the reptile full-bloods and crossbreeds of the BabylonianBrotherhood. The Sumerian Tablets prove beyond question that Genesis was a muchedited and condensed version of Sumer records. The Sumerian story of Edin became theLevite’s biblical Garden of Eden. Remember the story of ‘Moses’ being found in thebulrushes by the Egyptian princess? The same tale was told by the Sumerians-Babylonians about King Sargon the Elder. The story of Moses is make-believe, as is theEgyptian ‘captivity’, the Exodus, at least in the form described, and also the creation ofthe 12 tribes via Jacob.These texts were written by the Levites, the heads of which were reptilian mysteryschool initiates in Babylon. Their stories are symbolic and coded for initiates tounderstand and the masses to take literally. According to the Levites, Moses was givenhis laws and commandments by God on top of a mountain. Again and again we see thesymbol of mountains. One reason for this is that the top of a mountain is closer to theirsymbol of God - the Sun. Mount Sion means Sun Mountain. The Sun rising over theeastern mountains is still a major Brotherhood symbol today. The story of the Israelitesand Jews is largely a fantasy - the veil behind which the truth has been hidden. No-onehas been ‘had’ more comprehensively over these thousands of years than the peoplewho have considered themselves Jewish. They have been terrorised, used andmanipulated in the most merciless and grotesque fashion by their hierarchy to advancean Agenda which the Jewish people in general have not even begun to identify. There isno greater example of this manipulation than the way the reptilian bloodlines like the‘Jewish’ Rothschilds funded and supported the Nazis and allowed the rank and fileJewish people to reap the unspeakable consequences. The Levite story of Exodus is asmokescreen to hide the fact that the ‘Hebrew’ knowledge was stolen from the Egyptianmystery schools after they were infiltrated by the Babylonian Brotherhood. The"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"82Egyptians considered the ‘Jehovah’ revelation to be a robbery committed against thesacred sciences.2 Manly P. Hall, the Freemasonic historian and initiate, said that blackmagic dictated the state religion in Egypt and that the intellectual and spiritual activitiesof the people were paralysed by complete obedience to the dogma formulated by thepriestcraft. What a perfect description of the Levite-Babylonian mode of manipulationand of all the religions, like Christianity, which were to emerge from the lies theypeddled. And that’s a crucial point to remember. Judaism, Christianity and Islam allbase their beliefs on these same stories written by the Levites after their stay inBabylon. We are looking at a point in history which was to define and control the worldfrom then until now. The knowledge the Levites stole from Egypt and expanded as aresult of their stay in Babylon, became known as the Cabala (Kabala, Qaballa), whichcomes from the Hebrew root, QBL, meaning mouth to ear. This is the method used tocommunicate the most secret information to initiates. The Cabala is the esoteric streamof what is called Judaism, which in fact is a front for the Babylonian Brotherhood, as isthe Vatican. The Cabala is the secret knowledge hidden in codes within the OldTestament and other texts. Judaism is the literal interpretation of it. This is a techniqueyou can see in all the religions. An example of the Levite coding is the names of thefive scribes, Garia, Dabria, Tzelemia, Echanu and Azrel, in the second book of Esdrasor Ezra. The names and their true meanings are:•Garia: Marks which ancient scribes used to indicate that the text is either defectiveor has another meaning.•Dabria: Words comprising a phrase or text.•Tzelemia: Figures, something figured, or indicated in an obscure manner.•Echanu: Something which has been changed or doubled.•Azrel: The name of Esdras/Ezra, the suffix ‘el’ meaning the work of Ezra.3These five names for ‘scribes’ therefore read as one phrase to an initiate: “Marks ofwarning - of the words - figured in an obscure manner - which have been changed ordoubled - which is the work of Ezra.”4 There is a book called The Bible Code5 which claimsto have identified a code in the Hebrew version of the Old Testament which predicts thefuture. As one of these codes predicted that Lee Harvey Oswald would kill PresidentKennedy, you’ll excuse me if I remain extremely unconvinced about its credibility. Is thereanyone left who still believes that Oswald killed Kennedy? But while I question claims inThe Bible Code, there is a code in the Bible, an esoteric code for initiates. They either madeup characters to fit their symbolism or vaguely based them on living people who theyusually massively misrepresented. Here are some examples of codes in the Bible. A commontheme in all mystery school traditions is of 12 disciples, knights or followers surrounding adeity. The number 12 is a code, among other things, for the 12 months of the year and thehouses of the zodiac through which symbolically travels the Sun, the ‘god’, symbolised as13. This is the ‘sacred 12 and one’ as some people describe it and it is one major reason whythe numbers 12 and 13 keep recurring. Thus you have the 12 tribes of Israel, 12 princes of"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"83Ishmael, 12 disciples or followers of Jesus, Buddha, Osiris and Quetzalcoatl. There isalso King Arthur and his 12 Knights of the Round Table (the zodiac circle), Himmlerand his 12 knights in the Nazi SS, and the woman (Isis, Semiramis) with a crown of 12stars in the Book of Revelation. In Scandinavia and that whole northern region you findthe Odin mysteries, again inspired by the same Aryan race from the Near East. In thistradition, you find twelve ‘Drottars’ presiding over the mysteries with Odin. The sacred12 and one again. These stories are not literally true, they are mystery schoolsymbolism. This continues today with these same symbols used by the Brotherhoodsecret society network in national flags, coats of arms, advertising and company logos.That Brotherhood creation, the European Union, has a circle of 12 stars as its symbol.We are talking sacred numbers and geometry here. The proportions of Egyptian statues,whether big or small, were multiples or sub multiples of 12 or 6.The numbers 7 and 40 are also code numbers in the Bible and the mysteries. So in theBible we have seven spirits of God, the seven churches of Asia, seven golden candlesticks,seven stars, seven lamps of fire, seven seals, seven trumpets, seven angels, seven thundersand the red dragon in Revelation with seven heads and seven crowns. The story of Jerichohas Joshua marching his army around the city for seven days, accompanied by sevenpriests carrying seven trumpets. On the seventh day they circled Jericho seven times andthe walls came tumbling down. In the story of Noah, seven pairs of each animal go into theark and seven pairs of each type of bird. There are seven days between the prediction of thedeluge and the rain and seven days between the sending of the doves. The ark comes torest on the 17th day of the seventh month, Noah leaves the ark on the 27th day, and afterthe flood he begins his seventh century. Many of the names for the symbolic deities, suchas Abraxas of the Gnostics and Serapis of Greece have seven letters. Then there is 40.Adam enters Paradise when he is 40 years old; Eve follows 40 years later; during the GreatFlood it rains for 40 days and 40 nights; Seth is carried away by angels when he is 40 andis not seen for 40 days; Moses is 40 when he goes to Midian and he stays for 40 years;Joseph is 40 years old when Jacob arrives in Egypt; Jesus goes into the wilderness for 40days. The Bible is the word of God? No. It is written in the esoteric code of the mysteryschools. The Arabian literature was also compiled by and for initiates of the mysteries andhere you find the same codes. The Arbaindt (the forties) are stories which all relate to thenumber 40 and their calendar has 40 rainy and 40 windy days. Their laws constantly referto 40. Another series of Arabian books, the Sebaydt or ‘seven’ are based on that number.These number codes have even deeper meanings than the more obvious ones of days,months and the zodiac. Numbers also represent vibrational frequencies. Every frequencyresonates to a certain number, colour and sound. Some frequencies, represented bynumbers, colours and sounds, are particularly powerful. Symbols also representfrequencies and they affect the subconscious without the person realising it is happening.This is another reason why certain symbols are seen in secret societies, national flags,company logos, advertising and so on.There is no historical evidence for the existence of a man called Moses except in thetexts produced by the Levites and other writings and opinions stimulated by those texts."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"84Some say this was a cover name for the Egyptian pharaoh, Arkenaten, and I wouldcertainly not dismiss that, but the official background to ‘Moses’ and his name have nohistorical basis. Nothing was known about the ‘Moses’ story, or the ‘plagues’ inflictedupon the Egyptians, until the Levites of Babylon wrote Exodus centuries after it wassupposed to have happened. All the animals of Egypt were killed three times accordingto the story! What did they do, die and immediately remanifest? There was no murderof the first born of Egypt and so the Feast of the Passover has no historical basis, it wascreated as a result of a story invented by the Levites. Their references to the lamb’sblood on the doors is code for the ancient symbolism of the lamb. There is no officialbook in Hebrew which makes any mention of the Pentateuch (the laws of Moses) beforethe Levites went to Babylon. As for the Israelites being captive in Egypt, evenDeuteronomy describes them as ‘strangers’, not slaves, in this period.6 So where did thename Moses come from? Every initiated person who attained the highest rank in theEgyptian mystery schools was called a Muse, Mose or... Moses.7 Manetho, the Egyptianhistorian of the third century BC, quoted by the Jewish historian, Josephus, says that hewas a priest at Heliopolis or ON (Place of the Sun), and that afterwards he took thename of Mosheh or Moses.8 The word Moses means: he who has been taken away, hewho has been put out from the waters, who has been made a missionary, an ambassador,an apostle.9 The Chief Priest in the Egyptian temples was called EOVE or EOVA, hencethe emergence of the name Jehovah,10 and the Hebrew language is really the sacredlanguage of the Egyptian mystery schools.11 The general language of Egypt was calledCBT, QBT or CBT, and is better known as Copt or Coptic. The sacred language of themystery schools took its name from OBR or ABR which, in these times, meant thepassage from one place to another and a transition of some kind. Exactly the point ofthe original mystery school teachings, a transition to greater enlightenment. ABRbecame Ambres, the name of the holy doctrine reserved for initiates, and it was alsowritten as Ambric, Hebric, Hebraic and... Hebrew.12 The Hebrew alphabet has 22 letters,but the original, before the time of ‘Moses’, only contained ten, and its true meaningwas known only to the priests.Hebrews were not Israelites or Jews, they were initiates of the Egyptian mysteryschools, or at least their founders were. No wonder it has proved impossible to identify agenetic Hebrew or Jewish ‘race’. Cohen, the Jewish name for priest, comes from Cahen,the Egyptian pronunciation for a priest and a prince.13 Even circumcision, that uniquely‘Jewish’ tradition, came from the Egyptian mystery schools and was performed at leastas far back as 4,000 BC. You could not be initiated unless you were circumcised. TheHebrew religion did not exist in Egypt and there was no Hebrew law because there wasno Hebrew ‘race’. The only worship was Egyptian worship. The Hebrew religion,language and race only emerged when initiates of the Egyptian mysteries, later to beknown as Levites, took the knowledge out of Egypt and invented a whole history tocover what they were doing, who they were working for and where they came from. Theterms ‘Hebrew’ and ‘Judaism’ are another way of saying Egyptian. This is one reasonwhy we have the constant use of symbols by today’s Brotherhood which relate to Egypt,"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"85including the pyramid with the capstone missing. This is symbolic of the Great Pyramidat Giza and the Egyptian mystery schools, together with much deeper meanings. At theentrance to the mystery school temple in Egypt were two massive obelisks. These areoften represented as two pillars by the Freemasons and in buildings designed andfunded by initiates. Hence the two pillars that Samson pushed over. Every initiate in themystery schools was given a secret name and this also continues with the Brotherhoodtoday. One connection to the Hebrews in Egypt could be the invasion of the Hyksos orShepherd Kings. The Egyptian historian, Manetho, reported that a strange and barbaricrace invaded and took control of Egypt. When they were eventually driven out, he said,they journeyed through Syria and built a city called Jerusalem.14 The Hyksos could wellbe a group of similar description called the Habiru who came out of the former lands ofSumer, as did, according to the Old Testament, the one called Abraham.King Solomon and his temple are more symbolism. There is, again, no independentevidence for a person called King Solomon. Not once has his name appeared in anyinscriptions. Before the Levites wrote their texts, the Greek historian Herodotus (c. 485-425 BC), travelled and researched the lands and history of Egypt and the Near East. Heheard nothing of the empire of Solomon, the mass exodus of Israelites from Egypt, or thedestruction of the pursuing Egyptian army in the Red Sea. Nor did Plato in his travels tothe same area. Why? Because it is all invention. The three syllables in Sol-om-on are allnames for the Sun in three languages. Manly P Hall wrote that Solomon and his wives andconcubines were symbolic of the planets, moons, asteroids and other receptive bodieswithin his house - the solar mansion.15 Solomon’s Temple is symbolic of the domain ofthe Sun. In Talmudic legend, Solomon is presented as a master magician who understoodthe Cabala and cast out demons. This is more symbolism of the secret knowledge heldwithin the fabricated stories of Hebrew ‘history’. The books of Kings and Chronicles,which recount the building of Solomon’s Temple, were written between 500 and 600years after the events they are supposed to be describing. Hebrew chroniclers of theTemple of Solomon are so over the top, it’s hilarious. It was supposed to occupy 153,600workmen for seven years and its cost, worked out by Arthur Dynott Thomson, would havebeen £6,900 million. And Thomson was writing in 1872! What would it be today? Suchfigures are ludicrous and yet further examples of the make-believe behind these tales.They are symbolic, not literal. Another point. If Solomon didn’t exist, why should webelieve that his ‘father’, King David, did? I keep reading accounts of his life and the onlysources quoted are the Old Testament texts written by the Levites! There is no otherevidence. It’s a con. So is the idea of the King David-Jesus bloodline being taken toFrance by ‘Mary Magdalene’ to become the Merovingians as suggested in many booksover recent years. As the scholar and researcher, L. A. Waddell, points out:“There is absolutely no inscriptional evidence whatsoever, nor any ancient Greek orRoman reference, for the existence of Abraham or any of the Jewish patriarchs or prophetsof the Old Testament, nor for Moses, Saul, David, Solomon, nor any of the Jewish kings,with the mere exception of two, or at most three, of the later kings.”16"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"86The consequences of all this for the people who have called themselves Jewish, andfor humanity in general, have been quite appalling. The Mosaic Law, the law of‘Moses’, is the law of the Levites - the law of the reptilian full-bloods and crossbreedsof the Babylonian Brotherhood. What it is not, is the law or word of God. The Torahand Talmud, both compiled overwhelmingly in and after their time in Babylon, are amental bombardment of highly detailed laws governing every area of a person’s life.There’s no way that was given by ‘God’ on the top of a mountain. The Levites wrote itand then invented Moses to hide this fact. Other ‘laws’ have been constantly added orrevised since, to cover all eventualities. The pages of these Levite texts contain aconstant and sickening theme of extreme racism against non-Judeans and the need to‘utterly destroy’ anyone who defies them - exactly the way Manly Hall described themethods of the black magic priests. They encourage murder and mayhem of everyconceivable kind. The Talmud must be the most racist document on Earth. Here are justa few examples of the depth of its spiritual sickness:“Just the Jews are humans, the non-Jews are no humans, but cattle” Kerithuth 6b, page78, iebhammoth 61“The non-Jews have been created to serve the Jews as slaves” Midrasch Talpioth 225“Sexual intercourse with non-Jews is like sexual intercourse with animals” Kethuboth 3b“The non-Jews have to be avoided even more than sick pigs” Orach Chalim 57, 6a“The birth rate of non-Jews has to be suppressed massively” Zohar 11, 4b“As you replace lost cows and donkeys, so you shall replace non-Jews” Lore Dea 377,1But this is not just a grotesque diatribe of racism. Look again. It is the very attitudesthat the Draco reptilians and their underlings have towards humans. Remember thishorrific stuff was not written by Judeans or ‘Jews’ as a people. They are victims of thesebeliefs, not the authors. It was written by the Levites, representatives of the priestlybloodlines of the reptilians and the Babylonian Brotherhood, who have no moreallegiance to the Jewish people than did Adolf Hitler. To blame it on ‘the Jews’ is anonsense and exactly what the Brotherhood want people to do because it createsenormous opportunities to divide and rule, the very foundation of their control. Whathorrors this manipulation has caused for ‘Jew’ and ‘Gentile’ alike. It is the same with theJewish oral law called the Mishnah, completed by the second century AD. Israel Shahak,a survivor of the Belsen Concentration Camp, is one of the comparatively few peoplenow known as Jews, who has had the courage to openly challenge and expose theTalmud. Shahak, in his book Jewish History, Jewish Religion, highlights the stunninglevel of racism on which the ‘Jewish’ (Levite, Brotherhood) law is founded. He tells how"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"87the extreme end of this ‘faith’, as represented by the orthodox rabbis today, makes it areligious offence to save the life of a Gentile, unless there would be unpleasantconsequences for Jews not doing so. The charging of interest on loans to a fellow Jew isbanned, but by Talmudic law they must charge a Gentile as much interest as theypossibly can. It is demanded that Jews must utter a curse every time they pass a Gentilecemetery and that when they pass a Gentile building they must ask God to destroy it.Jews are forbidden to defraud each other, but that law does not apply to the defraudingof Gentiles. Jewish prayers bless God for not making them Gentiles and others ask thatChristians may perish immediately. A religious Jew must not drink from a bottle of wineif a Gentile has touched it since it was opened. The Jewish writer, Agnon, after beingawarded the Nobel Prize for literature, said on Israeli radio: “I am not forgetting that itis forbidden to praise Gentiles, but here there is a special reason for doing so - that is,they awarded the prize to a Jew.”17 These are the laws of the belief system called‘Jewish’ which is constantly complaining about, and condemning, racism against Jews!The very belief system is founded on the most extreme racism you will ever encounter.Yet the cry of “anti-Semitic” is used to discredit researchers who are getting too close tothe truth about the global conspiracy. Benjamin Freedman, a Jew who knew the topZionists (Sionists, Sun cultists) of the 1930s and 40s, said that anti-Semitism should beeliminated from the English language. He went on:“Anti-Semitism serves only one purpose today. It is used as a smear word. When so-calledJews feel that anyone opposes their real objectives, they discredit their victims by applyingthe word “anti-Semite” or “anti-Semitic” through all the channels they have at theircommand and under their control.”18One of these channels is an organisation based in the United States, and operatingworldwide, which was set up precisely to condemn as racists those exposing theBrotherhood. It is called the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and I have been a targetfor them myself, something I find very comforting and confirmation that I am going inthe correct direction. It has great support from non-Jewish sycophants who wish to keepthe ADL sweet and to feed their own desire to posture their sense of self-purity. I’ll takethe sanctimonious, holier-than-thou, ‘anti-racist’ movements seriously, when they beginto protest against all racism and not just that which suits their political correctness. Thesmell of hypocrisy makes my nostrils ache. This Levite racism is not followed by theoverwhelming majority of Jewish people and many have rebelled against the strict racelaws that demand that Jews only interbreed with Jews. Most people who callthemselves Jewish are brought up from birth to be the frightened, indoctrinated puppetsof this vicious Levite hierarchy which has metamorphosed as the Pharisees, theTalmudists and the extreme Zionists of today, controlled by the fanatical rabbisdispensing the ‘law’ of the Levites of Babylon on behalf of the reptilians. Most peoplewho follow the religions spawned from these sources have no idea of their true origin oragenda.

They are notconcerned for their followers, be they Jews, Roman Catholics, Muslims, whatever.Nothing emphasises what a sham all these religions and races really are than the presentday peoples we are told are ‘Jewish’. As Jewish writers and anthropologists have said,there is no such thing as the Jewish race. Jewishness is a faith, not a race. The wholeconcept of a ‘Jewish’ people was manufactured as a cover story. Alfred M. Lilenthal,the Jewish writer and researcher, said:“There is no reputable anthropologist who will not agree that Jewish racialism is as muchpoppycock as Aryan racialism... Anthropological science divides mankind into threerecognised races: Negro, Mongolian and Oriental, and Caucasian or white (although someauthorities refer to a fourth race - the australoids)... Members of the Jewish faith are foundin all three races and subdivisions.”19The point is, however, that within the Jewish faith and other cultures, is a race, ahidden race operating undercover, which carries the bloodlines of the reptilian full-bloods and crossbreeds. These bloodlines appear, on the surface, to be part of thesefaiths and cultures when, in fact, they are there to imprison and manipulate. So it is withthe Levites. It gets even more farcical, and indicative of what a smokescreen world welive in, when you realise that most people who call themselves Jewish today have nogenetic connection whatsoever to the land they call Israel. Yet it is this very connectionthat was used to justify the imposition of a ‘Jewish’ homeland on the Arab peoples ofPalestine! Again, as Jewish writers such as Arthur Koestler have exposed, all except asmall minority of people who created and populated the State of Israel, originategenetically in southern Russia, not Israel. The hooked nose which is considered so‘Jewish’ is a genetic trait of southern Russia and the Caucasus, not Israel. In 740 AD, apeople called the Khazars had a mass conversion to Judaism. Koestler writes:“The Khazars came not from Jordan, but from the Volga, not from Canaan, but from theCaucasus. Genetically they are more related to the Hun, Uigar and the Magyar than theseed of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. The story of the Khazar Empire, as it slowly emergesfrom the past, begins to look like the most cruel hoax that history has ever perpetrated.”20There are two main sub divisions of those who call themselves Jewish, theSephardim and the Ashkenazim. The Sephardim are the descendants of those wholived in Spain from antiquity until the 15th century when they were expelled. TheAshkenazim are the ancestors of the Khazars. In the 1960s, the Sephardim wereestimated to number some half a million, but the Ashkenazim numbered abouteleven million. These eleven million have absolutely no historical connection withIsrael whatsoever, but they are the ones who invaded Palestine and created the Stateof Israel with the justification that ‘God’ promised them that land in the OldTestament.

People controlled by the same forcewhich controlled the Levites, the Babylonian Brotherhood.The New TestamentOK, a little quiz. Who am I talking about?He was born to a virgin by immaculate conception through the intervention of a holyspirit. This fulfilled an ancient prophecy. When he was born the ruling tyrant wanted to killhim. His parents had to flee to safety. All male children under the age of two were slain bythe ruler as he sought to kill the child. Angels and shepherds were at his birth and he wasgiven gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. He was worshipped as the saviour of men andled a moral and humble life. He performed miracles which included healing the sick, givingsight to the blind, casting out devils and raising the dead. He was put to death on the crossbetween two thieves. He descended to hell and rose from the dead to ascend back toheaven.21Sounds exactly like Jesus doesn’t it? But it’s not. That is how they described the Easternsaviour god known as Virishna 1,200 years before Jesus is claimed to have been born. If youwant a saviour god who died so our sins could be forgiven, take your pick from the ancientworld because there are a stream of them, all originating with the Aryan and reptile-Aryanrace that came out of the Near East and the Caucasus Mountains. Here are just some of the‘Son of God’ heroes who play the lead role in stories which mirror those attributed to Jesusand almost all were worshipped long before Jesus was even heard of:Khrishna of Hindostan; Buddha Sakia of India; Salivahana of Bermuda; Osiris and Horusof Egypt; Odin of Scandinavia; Crite of Chaldea; Zoroaster of Persia; Baal and Taut ofPhoenicia; Indra of Tibet; Bali of Afghanistan; Jao of Nepal; Wittoba of Bilingonese;Tammuz of Syria and Babylon; Attis of Phrygia; Xamolxis of Thrace; Zoar of theBonzes; Adad of Assyria; Deva Tat and Sammonocadam of Siam; Alcides of Thebes;Mikado of the Sintoos; Beddru of Japan; Hesus or Eros, and Bremrillahm, of the Druids;Thor, son of Odin, of the Gauls; Cadmus of Greece; Hil and Feta of Mandaites; Gentautand Quetzalcoatl of Mexico; Universal Monarch of the Sibyls; Ischy of Formosa; DivineTeacher of Plato; Holy One of Xaca; Fohi and Tien of China; Adonis, son of virgin lo, ofGreece; Ixion and Quirinus of Rome; Prometheus of the Caucasus; and Mohammed orMahomet, of Arabia.22All but a few of those ‘sons of God’ or ‘prophets’, and the mind-prison religions foundedin their names, come from the very lands occupied or influenced by peoples emerging fromthe Near East and the Caucasus. The lands of the Aryans and reptile-Aryans. Other ‘sons ofGod’ included Mithra or Mithras, the pre-Christian Roman-Persian god, and in Greece andAsia Minor they had Dionysus and Bacchus.

Mithra was often portrayed asa winged lion, a symbol for the Sun still used by the secret societies today. Referencesto the lion and the ‘grip of the lion’s paw’ in the Master Mason Degree of Freemasonryoriginate with this same stream of mystery school symbolism. Initiates into the rites ofMithra were called lions and were marked on their foreheads with the Egyptian cross.The first degree initiates had a golden crown placed on their heads, representing theirspiritual self, and this crown, symbolising the rays of the sun, can be found on theStatue of Liberty in New York Harbour. All these rituals went back thousands of yearsto Babylon and the stories of Nimrod, Queen Semiramis, and Tammuz, their version ofJesus. Mithra was said to be the son (Sun) of god who died to save humanity and givethem eternal life. One classic symbol of Mithra was as a lion with a snake curled aroundhis body, while he holds the keys to heaven. This is more Nimrod symbolism and theorigin of the story of St Peter, one of Jesus’ 12 disciples, holding the keys to heaven.Peter was the name of the High Priest in the Babylon mystery school. After an initiateof the Mithran cult had completed the ritual, the members had a meal of bread and winein which they believed they were eating the flesh of Mithra and drinking his blood.Mithra, like a long list of pre-Christian gods, was said to have been visited by wise menat his birth who brought him gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. The same was saidby Plato of his teacher, Socrates, in ancient Greece. Christianity is a Pagan sun religion,the worship of which is condemned by Christianity! It is also an astrology religion, the‘evil’ of which is condemned by Christianity, not least by the Pope! Beam me up Scotty,it’s mad down here. The church hierarchy, of course, know all this. They just don’t wantyou to know. The mystery cult of Mithra spread from Persia to the Roman Empire andat one point this doctrine could be found in almost every part of Europe. The presentsite of the Vatican in Rome was a sacred place for the followers of Mithra, and hisimage and symbols have been found cut into rocks and stone tablets throughout thewestern provinces of the former Roman domain, including Germany, France andBritain. Christianity and the Roman Church were based on the Persian-Roman Sun godcalled Mithra (Nimrod), who has an earlier equivalent in India called Mitra. Tammuz orAdonis (Lord), who was revered in Babylonia and Syria, was said to have been born atmidnight on December 24th. These were also ‘sons’ of God.Horus was the the ‘son’ of God in Egypt. He was derived from the BabylonianTammuz and, in turn, provided another blueprint for the later Jesus. Theconnections are devastating for the credibility of the Christian Church: Jesus wasthe Light of the World. Horus was the Light of the World. Jesus said he was theway, the truth and the life. Horus said he was the truth, the life. Jesus was born inBethlehem, the ‘house of bread’. Horus was born in Annu, the ‘place of bread’.Jesus was the Good Shepherd. Horus was the Good Shepherd.

Horus was tempted on amountain by Set.23Jesus is said to be the ‘judge of the dead’. He has some competition there. This wasalso said of the earlier Nimrod, Khrishna, Buddha, Ormuzd, Osiris, Aeacus and others.Jesus is the Alpha and Omega, the first and the last. So was Khrishna, Buddha, Lao-kiun, Bacchus, Zeus and others. Jesus is claimed to have performed miracles such ashealing the sick and raising people from the dead. So did Khrishna, Buddha, Zoroaster,Bochia, Horus, Osiris, Serapis, Marduk, Bacchus, Hermes and others. Jesus was bornof royal blood. So was Buddha, Rama, Fo-hi, Horus, Hercules, Bacchus, Perseus andothers. Jesus was born to a virgin. So was Khrishna, Buddha, Lao-kiun or tsze,Confusius, Horus, Ra, Zoroaster, Prometheus, Perseus, Apollo, Mercury, Baldur,Quetzalcoatl and far too many others to mention. Jesus will, we are told, be bornagain. The sky is going to be rather crowded because Khrishna, Vishnu, Buddha,Quetzalcoatl and others, will also be there. The ‘star’ at the birth ofJesus is another multideity story and goes back at least to theBabylonian tale of Nimrod who, in a dream, saw a brilliant starrising above the horizon. The soothsayers told him that this foretoldthe birth of a child who would become a great prince.24 It’s allrecycling. Jesus is a myth man.The invented character of Jesus was a Sun god, symbolic ofGod’s ‘Sun’... The Light of the World. This very phrase, Light of theWorld, was used by the Aryan-Phoenicians to symbolise the ‘onetrue god’ thousands of years before the alleged birth of Abraham, thequite wrongly named creator of the one-god concept.25 They alsosymbolised the one true god, the Sun, with the ‘one true cross’ 26 TheChristians portray Jesus with a halo around his head and that’sexactly how the Phoenicians depicted the rays of the Sun around thehead of their Sun god, Bel or Bil. This can be seen on a Phoenicianstone dating to about the 4th centurv BC (see Figure 14). The Sunwas at the heart of the Egyptian religion and at noon when the Sunwas at the peak of its daily ‘journey’, they prayed to the ‘MostHigh’. At this time, they said the Sun was going about his father’swork in the temple. The virgin mothers associated with all of theseSun gods were different names for Queen Semiramis andNinkharsag, also known as Isis, the Egyptian symbol of the femalecreative force without which nothing, not even the Sun, could exist.Over time, names for what had once symbolised extraterrestrial‘gods’ became used to describe concepts and esoteric principles.Different eras and cultures gave different names to these sameFigure 14: APhoenicianstanding stonedepicting their SunGod, Bel or Bil, withthe halorepresenting therays of the Sun.This is precisely theway ‘Jesus’ isportrayed becausehe, too, was asymbol of the Sun."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"92concepts and so in the Gospels, Horus becameJesus and Isis became Mary, the virgin mother ofJesus, the Sun. Mary is constantly picturedholding the baby Jesus, but this is merely a repeatof all the Egyptian portrayals of Isis holding thebaby Horus (see Figure 15). These people did notactually exist, they are symbolic. Isis becameassociated with the astrological sign of Virgo thevirgin, as did Mary. The titles given to Isis of‘Star of the Sea’ and ‘Queen of Heaven’ were alsogiven to Mary and they both originate fromQueen Semiramis, who was called the Queen ofHeaven in Babylon. Christianity and Judaism areboth the religion of Babylon.Throughout the world you see the same Sunreligions and rituals, in Sumer, Babylon, Assyria,Egypt, Britain, Greece, Europe in general,Mexico and Central America, Australia...everywhere. It was the universal religion inspiredby the same, ultimately extraterrestrial, sourcethousands of years before Christianity. Sun andfire worship was the focus of religions in India where their festivals charted the Sun’scycle through the year,27 and in the Jesus story you see constant symbolic references tothis and to astrology and mystery school symbolism. The crown of thorns is the symbolof the rays of the Sun, just like the crown of spikes around the head of the Statue ofLiberty. The cross is also Sun and astrological symbolism, as you saw earlier with thecross and the circle. Leonardo da Vinci, the Grand Master of the Priory of Sion (Sun),used this same symbolism in his famous painting of the Last Supper (see Figure 16).He divides the 12 disciples into four groups of three with Jesus, the ‘Sun’, in the middleof them. Again this is astrological symbolism painted by a high initiate of the secretsocieties and mystery schools who knew the truth. It may well be that da Vinci hasportrayed one of the disciples as a woman to symbolise the Isis, Barati, Semiramis,deity. This became symbolised as an ‘M’ for Mary or Madonna (Semiramis). Jesus issaid to have been born on December 25th, a date the Christians took from the Sunreligions of Sol Invictus (the Sun Unconquered) for reasons I’ve explained. He is alsosaid to have died at Easter on a cross. This is a repeat of the same ancient story again.The Egyptians represented Osiris stretched out on a cross in astrological symbolism.According to the ancients, it took three days for the Sun to recover from ‘death’ onDecember 2lst/22nd. In the Gospels how many days are there between Jesus ‘dying’and ‘rising’ from the dead? Three! The same time it took the Babylon Son of God,Tammuz, to rise again. This is how Luke’s Gospel describes what happened as Jesus(the Sun) died on the cross:Figure 15: Mary and Jesus? No, this is theway the Egyptians portrayed Isis and Horus.If you lived in ancient Babylon this wouldhave been Queen Semiramis and Tammuz."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"93“And it was about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over all the Earth until theninth hour. And the Sun was darkened...” Luke 23-44,45The son/Sun had died and so there was darkness. And look how many hours thislasted for: three. The same story of darkness at their death was told by the Hindus ofKhrishna, the Buddhists of Buddha, the Greeks of Hercules, the Mexicans ofQuetzalcoatl, ad infinitum, long before Jesus. When he died, Jesus ‘descended intohell’, just like the earlier Khrishna, Zoroaster, Osiris, Horus, Adonis/Tammuz, Bacchus,Hercules, Mercury and so on. He then rose from the dead like the earlier Khrishna,Buddha, Zoroaster, Adonis/Tammuz, Osiris, Mithra, Hercules and Baldur. Jesus wassymbolically crucified at Easter because this is the spring equinox when the Sun (Jesus)enters the astrological sign of Aries, the Ram or... the lamb. The lamb in the Book ofRevelation is the same symbol. In around 2,200 BC the group known as the Priesthoodof Melchizedek began making their aprons with lamb’s wool, a symbol continued todayby a modern expression of the Brotherhood, the Freemasons. It is at Easter, the equinox,that Jesus (the Sun) triumphs over darkness - the time of year when there is more lightthan darkness every day. The world is restored by the power of the Sun in the time ofrebirth and the spring equinox was one of the most sacred Egyptian events. Queen Isiswas often portrayed with rams heads to symbolise that the time of Aries, the spring, wasa period of nature’s abundant creation. The Festival of Easter was as important to earlyChristians as December 25th. The legend of Mithra said he was crucified and wasresurrected on March 25th. The date of Easter is no longer fixed to the first day ofAries, but the symbolism remains. The Christian religious day is... SUNday. Christianchurches are build east-west with the altar to the east. This means that the congregationface east - the direction of the rising Sun. Even Easter eggs, like hot cross buns, are nota Christian tradition. Dyed eggs were sacred Easter offerings in Egypt and Persia,among other places. How ironic that the authorities at Westminster Abbey havequestioned whether they should have a Christmas tree because it is a Pagan symbol.The whole flippin’ religion is pagan!Figure 16: The Last Supper by Leonardo Da Vinci. Look how he symbolises Jesus as the Sun and breaks upthe twelve disciples into four sets of three - the signs of the zodiac. It is a pictodal version of the sun circle andthe cross we saw earlier."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"94Along with the Sun symbolism, the Jesus story and its countless predecessors alsoinclude initiation symbolism from the mystery schools. The cross as a religious symbolcan be found in every culture, from the Native Americans to the Chinese, India, Japan,Egypt, Sumer, the ancient peoples of Europe and central-south America. The BuddhistWheel of Life is made of two superimposed crosses and birds with their wings open areused to symbolise the cross in endless logos, coats of arms and badges. One of the mostancient forms of the cross is the Tau or Tav cross which resembles the letter T. This wasthe cross on which political dissidents were hung by the Romans, apparently. It was thesymbol of the Druid god, Hu, and it is still used today by the Freemasons in their symbolof the T square. The Egyptian’s Crux Ansata, the ‘cross of life’, added a circle loop to thetop. The Crux Ansata and the Tau cross were found on statues and other artworkthroughout ancient Central America. It was associated with water and the Babyloniansused the cross as an emblem of the water gods who they said had brought them theircivilisation. The Nagas, by the way, the human-reptile gods of the East, were also said tolive in the water. The concept of a saviour god figure dying for humanity is an ancientone. The religions of India had a tradition of the crucified saviour centuries beforeChristianity and it originated from the Aryans in the Caucasus. The Hindu ‘Christ’figure, Khrishna, appears in some portrayals nailed to a cross in classic Jesus manner.28Quetzalcoatl is said to have come out of the sea carrying a cross and he has beenrepresented as being nailed to a cross. In mystery school symbolism, a cross of gold =illumination; a cross of silver = purification; a cross of base metals = humiliation; and across of wood = aspiration. The latter relates to the constant symbolism of the tree andsaviour god figures dying on trees or wooden crosses. Some of the Pagan mysteryceremonies involved the student hanging from a cross or lying on an altar in the shape ofa cross.29 It symbolised the death of the body, the world of physical domination anddesire, and opening to the spiritual self. The driving in of nails and the flow of blood isyet more mystery school symbolism. The crucifixion of Jesus was an allegory, asymbolic event written to carry a hidden meaning. It did not physically happen, you arejust meant to think it did. And what of the physical resurrection from the dead by Jesus?St Paul is quoted as saying of this event in his first letter to the Corinthians:“But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen: And if Christ be not risen,then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain. Yea, and we are found false witnessesof God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, ifso be that the dead rise not.” Corinthians 15:13-16He says that if Jesus was not physically raised from the dead, there is no basis tothe Christian faith and religion. If that’s the case, Christianity is in serious trouble.First of all the Gospel accounts of the resurrection have numerous contradictions aseach copied the original story differently, or changed it on purpose. And secondly theresurrection is yet more Sun symbolism from the ancient religions. In Persia, longbefore Christianity, they had a ritual in which a young man, apparently dead, was"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"95restored to life. He was called the Saviour and his sufferings were said to have ensuredthe salvation of the people. His priests watched his tomb until midnight on the equinoxand they cried: “Rejoice, 0 sacred initiated! Your God is risen. His death and sufferingshave worked your salvation.” The same tale was told in Egypt about Horus and in Indiaabout Khrishna a thousand years before Christianity. The Bible tells us that Jesus willreturn on a cloud and what do we see among the clouds? The Sun. The tomb of Jesus issymbolic of the darkness into which the Sun descended before its rebirth and nearly allthe mystery school initiations involved some sort of cave, underground chamber, ordark enclosed space, like the sweatlodges of native America. Even the story of the spearwhich pierced the side of Jesus after he was taken from the cross is mystery schoolsymbolism. The Christian legend says that this was done by a blind Roman centurioncalled Longinus and some of the blood of Jesus fell on his eyes and cured his blindness.Longinus was converted and spent the rest of his life breaking up Pagan idols. Yeah,sure he did. Centurions were not blind and could not have done their job if they were,and once again we find this story is a repeat from earlier versions. The Scandinaviansaviour, Balder, son of Odin, had a spear of mistletoe thrust into him by Hod, a god whowas blind. March 15th, the Ides of March, was when many Pagan saviours also died.This day was devoted to Hod and later became a Christian feast day to the ‘BlessedLonginus’!30 You’ve got to laugh, really.The symbol of the fish is a theme throughout the Gospel stories and this is symbolicof Nimrod/Tammuz, the father-son, of Babylon. Another reason for Jesus as a fish couldbe the astrological sign of Pisces, the fishes. Around the time Jesus was supposed tohave been born, the Earth was entering the astrological house of Pisces. A new age wasbeing born and Jesus the fish could have been a symbol of the age of Pisces. We arenow entering another new age, the age of Aquarius, according to the laws of the ‘Earthwobble’ precession. When the Bible talks of the end of the world, this is anothermistranslation. They translate ‘world’ from the Greek, ‘aeon’, but aeon does not meanworld, it means ‘age’.31 We are not facing the end of the world, but the end of the age,the 2,160 years of Pisces. Christianity did not replace the Pagan religions, it is a Paganreligion. The Persians, who inherited their beliefs from Sumer, Egypt and Babylon, hadbaptism, confirmation, paradise and hell, angels of light and darkness, and a fallenangel. All of these were absorbed by Christianity and claimed for their own.During the alleged life time of Jesus, the Essene Brotherhood, was based atQumran at the northern end of the Dead Sea, or at least that is what we are told.Brian Desborough’s research indicates that this site was a leper colony at the timeand that the Essenes lived in a much more appropriate place further along the DeadSea coast. The Dead Sea Scrolls, found in caves near Qumran in 1947, have offered agreater insight into their lifestyle and beliefs, despite suppression by the authoritieswho wish to maintain the official version of history. The scrolls were hidden fromthe Romans during the ill-fated Judean revolt around 70 AD. Some 500 Hebrew andAramaic manuscripts were found, which included texts from the Old Testament,among them a complete draft of the Book of Isaiah, centuries older than the one in"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"96the Bible. There were scores of documents relating to the Essene customs andorganisation. The scrolls confirm that the Essenes were fanatics who followed to theletter the Levite inventions in the Old Testament texts. Anyone who didn’t do the samewas their enemy and they fiercely opposed the Roman occupation. They were aPalestine branch of an even more extreme Egyptian sect called the Therapeutae(‘healers’, hence therapeutic 32) and they inherited the secret knowledge of Egypt andthe ancient world. The Therapeutae and the Essenes also used the symbol of the‘messeh’, the ‘Draco’ crocodile of Egypt, the fat of which anointed the Pharaohs underthe authority of the Royal Court of the Dragon. The Essenes had a detailedunderstanding of drugs, including the hallucinogenic variety, which were used inmystery school initiations and for entering otherstates of consciousness. The properties of the‘sacred mushrooms’ or ‘Holy Plant’ were so muchpart of life in the secret brotherhood that the Jewishhigh priest wore a mushroom cap (see Figure 17)to acknowledge their importance. They had specialrituals for their preparation and use. Themushroom, too, was given son of God’connotations (what wasn’t?) and it was connectedto the Sun cycle. The mushrooms were picked withgreat reverence before sunrise and many symbolsof this ritual can be found in the Bible and far oldertexts. Again, the use of the sacred mushroom andother drugs, and the secret knowledge of theirproperties, can be traced back to the earliest daysof Sumer.33 The Therapeutae had a flourishinguniversity at Alexandria and from there they sentout missionaries to establish branches and affiliatedcommunities across the Middle East. Here againwe have the connection back to Egypt and themystery schools.The Essenes were advocates of Pythagoras, theGreek philosopher and esoteric mathematician,who was a high initiate of both the Greek andEgyptian mystery schools.34 According to the most famous historian of the period,Josephus, the Essenes were sworn to keep secret the names of the powers who ruled theuniverse. This was in line with the laws of the mystery schools. The Essenes-Therapeutae practised rituals very similar to the later Christian baptism and theymarked the foreheads of initiates with a cross. This being the symbol indicated in theOld Testament Book of Ezekiel for enlightened (or illuminated) ones and also used forinitiations into the mysteries of Mithra and other such Sun god figures. The Essenesviewed natural bodily functions, including sex, with disgust and in that sense they wereFigure 17: The Jewish priest with themushroom cap to symbolise the importanceof magic hallucinogenic mushrooms in theirrituals."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"97an excellent forerunner of the Roman Church which was to absorb many of their beliefs,terms and practises. Two of the Dead Sea Scrolls, one in Hebrew, the other in Aramaic,contain what we would call horoscopes, the belief that the movement of the planetsaffects a person’s character and destiny. The Essenes practised astrology, the symbolismof which you find throughout the Gospels and the Old Testament. The early Christians,an offshoot of the Essenes-Therapeutae, did the same, as did the Romans and all theGentile nations surrounding Judea.35 The writer, Philo, who lived at the alleged time ofJesus, said in his Treatise on the Contemplative Life, that when the Therapeutae prayedto God, they turned to the Sun and they studied in order to discover the hidden (coded)meaning of sacred books. He wrote that they also meditated on the secrets of naturecontained in the books under the veil of allegory.36 That is precisely the way the Bible iswritten. Today this secret language is used in the logos, coats of arms and flags, ofcompanies, countries and other Brotherhood-controlled organisations.Interconnected with the Essenes and a theme which links both the Old and NewTestaments is the secret society called the Nazarites or Nazarenes. Old Testamentcharacters such as Moses and Samson were said to be members of this group and sowere Jesus, his brother James, John the Baptist and St Paul. The Acts of the Apostlessays of St Paul: “For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of seditionamong all of the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of theNazarenes.”37 None of these people really existed, but the Nazarene symbolism makes asecret society link through the Bible. The Essenes and the Nazarites-Nazarenes appearto be different offshoots of the same group. The Essenes wore white according to theJudean historian Josephus, but the Nazarenes wore black, the same as the priests of Isisin Egypt. Black is a colour of the Babylonian Brotherhood which has manipulated itsway through history. In keeping with this, black has become the colour associated withauthority (look at the legal profession) and with death. It is also the traditional colour ofthe teaching profession with the black gown and the black hat called the mortar board,which is the circle and square symbol of Freemasonry. The greatest miracle of Jesus, itseems, was coming from Nazareth because Nazareth did not exist at the time. And Jesussaid: “Let there be Nazareth. And there was Nazareth.” Or rather, there wasn’t. Thename does not appear in any of the detailed Roman records, nor in any books, writingsor documents of any kind relating to the period covered by the Gospels. Jesus the‘Nazarene’ does not relate to Nazareth, but to the Nazarene secret society.The Essenes-Therapeutae-Nazarenes were the bridge between the Old Testament,the New Testament and the creation of Christianity. The early ‘Christians’ were calledNazarenes before they were called Christians.38 The rituals of the NazareneBrotherhood can be clearly seen in the Christian Church today. The Nazarenes woreblack and so do most Christian clerics. At Qumran they had a ritual bath to wash awaytheir ‘sins’. This became the Christian baptism. They had a meal of bread and winewhich became the Christian Mass. W.

Today the Arabic word for Christians isNasrani and the Muslim Koran uses the term Nasara or Nazara. These originate with theHebrew word, Nozrim, which derived from the term, Nozrei ha-Brit - the Keepers ofthe Covenant. The term, Nozrei ha-Brit, can be traced as far back as the alleged time ofSamuel and Samson in the Old Testament. Samuel was portrayed as the top man of theLevites and it was they who orchestrated this whole Bible-Talmud scam under thedirection of the Babylonian Brotherhood. The Covenant is the Freemason’s Great Workof Ages - the Agenda for the takeover of the planet by the reptilians.The bloodlines, the ‘chosen people’ of the gods, and the secret knowledge, aresymbolised as ‘the vine’ and ‘vineyards’ in the Bible and countless other writings andpictures. The Old Testament speaks of “The vine thou didst bring out of Egypt”.39 Weare also told that “The vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the House of Israel and the menof Judah his pleasant plant”40 The bloodline symbolised as the vine is not, I wouldstrongly suggest, the bloodline of King David at all. He didn’t exist for a start, whichconfirms the point rather conclusively. The symbolism of the vine can once again betraced back to Babylon and Egypt. In the mystery schools of Greece, their Sun godsDionysus and Bacchus, were the patron gods of the vineyard.41 What do grapes dependupon to grow? The Sun. The vine and the bloodline of ‘Jesus’ weaved in among thatSun symbolism is one of the royal and priestly bloodlines which lead back to thereptilians, the Anunnaki. The New Testament features the Wedding at Cana, but thiswas not a real wedding. It is again symbolic of the Sun and the Earth, the god andgoddess. In the land of Canaan every spring, they celebrated sexual and fertility ritesunder the title, ‘The Marriage Festival of Canaan’.42 It was at the symbolic wedding atCana in the Gospels that Jesus turns the water into wine. It is the Sun’s warmth and theEarth’s water which grow the grapes to make wine. Bacchus, the Greek son of Zeus andthe virgin Semele, was said to have turned water into wine. Also there were Esseneritual terms related to water and wine. The Essenes, Therapeutae and Gnostics wereseriously into hidden meanings and the Jesus stories are a mass of interweavedallegories related to the Sun, astronomy, astrology, bloodlines, secret knowledge and therituals and names used by the mystery schools. The New Testament is a mirror of theOld in that some fact, much fiction, and a mass of esoteric codes and symbols are fused,and often con-fused, into a narrative which is desperately misleading if taken literally.This is summed up by the phrase: “Let he who has ears, let him hear”. Let he who isinitiated into the secret knowledge understand what I am really saying. Let he who isnot initiated believe any old crap.Here are a few more Bible myths to explode:•The idea of the ‘carpenter’ is a translation error. The English translation of‘carpenter’ comes from the Hebrew word naggar, via the Greek, ho tekton. Thesewords do not mean literally a ‘carpenter’, but people who were masters of their craftand the word was applied to teachers and scholars as well as craftsmen."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"99•Jesus was definitely not born in a stable and not a single gospel claims this is so. TheChristmas nativity is complete invention. The concept comes from Luke’s Gospel43which says that Jesus was laid in a manger, an animal feeding box, because therewas no room in the inn. But the Greek version, from which the English translationcame, says there was no ‘topos’ in the ‘kataluma’ - there was no place in the room.44Matthew’s Gospel specifically states that Jesus was in a house: “And when theywere come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary, his mother, and felldown and worshipped him.”45 Mangers were often used for babies when a propercradle was not available, but they moved the manger to the baby, not the baby to themanger!•The nativity scene apparently originates with St Francis of Assisi in Greccio, Italy, in1223 AD.46 He brought together some local people and their livestock to illustratethe birth of Jesus and this nativity scene quickly caught on. Manger scenes carvedfrom wood became popular all over Italy at Christmas and the rest is history. Givinggifts is not a Christian custom, either. This was done in the Pagan world at New Yearlong before Christianity. The Christians simply borrowed it, as they did everythingelse.•The prophecies said that the ‘messiah’ (messeh, the crocodile of Egypt) would becalled Emmanuel, but the name of the Gospel ‘messiah’ was Jesus, or at least itsJudean equivalent. Oops! Funny how Christians seem to miss this point when theyquote the prophecy about the coming of ‘Emmanuel’ every Christmas. Think of allthose children who have been dressed up as Mary, Joseph, shepherds, wise men,donkeys, cows and sheep. This fantasy has been used to indoctrinate countlessgenerations to believe that this is how it all happened, when, in truth, the nativityand the Christmas story are the acting out of translation errors, an invention of StFrancis, and the mid-winter rituals of Pagan beliefs. I say, Jenny and Johnny, beforeyou don those costumes this year, can I have a quiet word?•The Christian Eucharist, when they eat bread and drink wine to symbolise thebody and blood of Christ, originates with a cannibalistic ritual when they ate anddrank the real thing in animal and human sacrifices. Most of the Christian termscome from the Greek, including Christ and Christianity. Among many others areChurch (the Lord’s House), Ecclesiastical (Ecclesia, the Greek Assembly orParliament), Apostle (missionary), Presbyter/priest (elder), and baptism(immersion).•Even according to the Gospel stories, Jesus was surrounded by terrorists. SimonMagus was known as Simon Zelotes (the Zealot) to acknowledge his role as acommander of the Zealots, the ‘freedom fighters’ who advocated a war against theRomans. Another description is Simon ‘Kananites’, a Greek word meaning fanatic.This was translated into English as Simon the Canaanite! Judas ‘Iscariot’ derives fromthe word Sicarius, which meant assassin. There was a terrorist group called the Sicanior Sons of the Dagger, and this name comes from the word, Sica, meaning curveddagger.

The Zealots-Sicani would raid Roman supply caravans andambush their soldiers very much along the lines of terrorist groups like the IRA inNorthern Ireland.•People were not crucified for theft which makes the story of the two thievescrucified with Jesus another invention. It is a ‘steal’ once again because the samestory was told about some of the pre-Christian Jesus figures. The punishment for the‘crimes’ Jesus was accused of in the Gospels would have been stoning to death bythe Judean authorities, not the Romans.•Pontius Pilatus, the Roman Procurator in this period, is supposed to have washed hishands and passed on responsibility for the death of ‘Jesus’ to the crowd. Thewashing of hands to indicate innocence was the custom of the Essene community.47The Bible says that it was the Roman custom at the time of the Passover Festival tooffer a prisoner for release, but this is simply not true. There was no such custom andthe scene is invention.You can write an entire book about the myths in the Bible and, in fact, someone has.It’s called, appropriately, Bible Myths, and if you want detailed documentation of theinformation in this chapter I thoroughly recommend it. There is no credible evidencewhatsoever for the existence of Jesus. No archaeological evidence, no written evidence,nothing. So it is with Solomon, Moses, David, Abraham, Samson and countless otherbiblical ‘stars’. All we have are the Levite texts and the Gospel stories in their variousversions. So desperate did the religious manipulators become to cross reference ‘Jesus’that they inserted a pathetically obvious addition into the works of the ‘Jewish’historian, Josephus, to support the unsupportable. More than 40 writers are known tohave chronicled the events of these lands during the alleged time of Jesus, but theydon’t mention him.48 A guy who did all the things that he was supposed to have doneand no-one records it? Philo lived throughout the supposed life of Jesus and wrote ahistory of the Judeans which covered the whole of this period. He even lived in or nearJerusalem when Jesus was said to have been born and Herod was supposed to havekilled the children, yet he doesn’t record any of this. He was there when Jesus is said tohave made his triumphant arrival in Jerusalem and when he was crucified and rose fromthe dead on the third day. What does Philo say about these fantastic events? Nothing.Not a syllable. Not a titter.49 None of this is mentioned in any Roman record or in thecontemporary accounts of the writers of Greece and Alexandria who were familiar withwhat happened there.50Why? Because it didn’t happen. It was a symbolic, coded story to pass on esotericand astrological knowledge of many kinds and, most crucially, to create another prison-religion based on the symbols of the Babylonian Brotherhood.

If anyone requires confirmationof how easy it is for the few to control the masses, they need look no further than thebillions of people who have worshipped the fairy tales peddled these past 2,000 yearsby men in long frocks. And what goes for Christianity goes for the rest of them,Judaism, Islam, Hinduism and all the rest.These religions were created by the same force to achieve the same effect and,therefore, the saviour-god myths throughout the ancient world have an identical gameplan: 1 You are born with original sin and so you are an unworthy piece of shit from theday you arrive on the planet. 2 You can only be saved by believing in the ‘Saviour’ andthat means doing what the priesthood tell you to do. 3 If you don’t do that, you will becondemned to the bowels of hell forever. What guilt and terror this has created overthousands of years. I have heard Roman Catholic mothers in anguish after their babieshave died wondering what will have happened to them. The babies couldn’t believe inJesus because they were only a few days old, so would they go to heaven or hell? I waswatching a Roman Catholic television channel in the United States and the guy with thelong frock was asked about that. He said it was a profound theological question. Ohreally? He said that either the baby’s soul would go into limbo (until when onewonders?) or it would be judged on the behaviour of the parents. What staggeringnonsense. Thank goodness the baby won’t be judged on the behaviour of the priests.And if you can only be saved by believing in Jesus, what about all those billions ofpeople throughout the period of Christianity who lived in vast areas of the world whohad never heard of Jesus? Are they all condemned by lack of information to stoke thefires, too? Bit of an arsehole, this Christian God, eh? But of course it’s not true. It’s allmake-believe, conjured up by the Babylonian Brotherhood initiates of the reptilians tocontrol the minds of the masses.When I was writing this section of the book and investigating where the Gospels camefrom, I was reaching to take a book from a high shelf in my office. As I pulled the bookdown, another smaller one fell to the floor. I don’t remember seeing it before, but the titleimmediately caught my attention. It was The True Authorship Of The New Testament byAbelard Reuchlin, first printed in the United States in 1979.1 It talked about an inner circleor inner ring, the most exclusive club in history, who knew the ‘Great Secret’. In this circlewere those religious, political and literary leaders, who knew the truth about Jesus, but didnot want anyone else to know. What struck me was that this book came to the same"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"104conclusions that I had. The Gospels are an invention designed to manufacture a newprison-religion. The book doesn’t go into all the symbolism I have documented here,but it does name the family and others who wrote the New Testament and the codesthey used to ‘sign’ their authorship. One of these codes, interestingly, is the number 40 Ihighlighted earlier. Forty was also represented by the letter M, as in Mary. The letter Mis very significant to the Brotherhood still today and we see it everywhere in the symbolof the McDonalds fast food chain. We will see later how the big corporations useBrotherhood symbolism in their logos and names. M means Mary or Madonna, whomeans Semiramis. The wealth of evidence in Reuchlin’s book, much of it complex anddealing with esoteric mathematical codes, is extremely compelling. I do recommendyou try to get hold of a copy if you want the full details. The opening paragraphencapsulates its findings:“The New Testament, the Church and Christianity, were all the creation of the CalpurniusPiso (pronounced Peso) family, who were Roman aristocrats. The New Testament and allthe characters in it - Jesus, all the Josephs, all the Marys, all the disciples, apostles, Paul,John the Baptist - all are fictional. The Pisos created the story and the characters; they tiedthe story to a specific time and place in history; and they connected it with some peripheralactual people, such as the Herods, Gamaliel, the Roman procurators, etc. But Jesus andeveryone involved with him were created (that is fictiotional!) characters.”2The Pisos were a bloodline family descended from statesmen, consuls, poets andhistorians, and such people would definitely be initiates of the secret society network ofthe Roman Empire, a major stepping stone for the reptilian full-bloods and crossbreedsto the present day. This is why a Roman soldier is the logo of that Brotherhoodoperation, American Express. The Piso family claimed to descend from Calpus who,they said, was the son of Numa Pompilius, the successor to Romulus, the founder ofRome. These were seriously connected people. Such Roman bloodlines are said to havecome from Troy and we are looking at a family which goes back to the Caucasus andthe Near East. After the destruction of Troy around 1,200 BC, the story goes that a guycalled Aeneas of a ‘royal’ (that is reptilian) bloodline went with the remnants of hispeople and settled in Italy. There he married into the royal family of the Latins andthrough this bloodline later emerged the Roman Empire. According to many traditions,the grandson of Aeneas, a man called Brutus, landed in Britain around 1,103 BC with agroup of Trojans, including some from colonies in Spain, to become King of the Britonsand found the city of New Troy - London.Lucius Calpurnius Piso, the head of the family, was married to the greatgranddaughter of Herod the Great. According to Reuchlin’s research, Piso, who usedmany pseudonyms, produced his ‘Ur Marcus’, the first version of the Gospel of Mark,in about 60AD. One of the friends who encouraged him was the famous Roman writer,Annaeus Seneca, but it seems that both of them were killed by the Emperor Nero in theyear 65. With this, the name Piso disappears from Roman history and doesn’t reappear"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"105until 138 AD when Piso’s grandson, Antoninus, became emperor. But from this pointthe family are mostly known as the Antonines, not the Pisos. In the 73 years betweenthe death of father Piso and the emergence of Antoninus, the foundations forChristianity were written and proclaimed under assumed names. After the death of hisfather at the hands of Nero, Piso’s son, Anus, who used a number of names, includingCestius Gallus, was made governor of Syria. This gave him command over the Romanarmy in Judea. He was involved in the Judean revolt in 66 AD which Vespasian wassent to Judea to quell. Emperor Nero was assassinated in 68 AD by an agent of Pisoaccording to Reuchlin. This certainly makes sense if Nero killed his father. With this,the Piso clan threw their power and manipulation behind Vespasian and he becameEmperor of Rome in 69 AD. A year later the Romans destroyed Jerusalem, stole thetemple treasures, including it is claimed the Ark of the Covenant, and apparently tookthem back to Rome where they entered the secret society underground. Thisunderground was nothing less than the Babylonian Brotherhood.Reuchlin says that Anus Calpurnius Piso then wrote three of the Gospels in thefollowing order: The Gospel of Matthew (70-75 AD); the updated Mark (75-80); and,with the help of the Roman writer and statesman, Pliny the Younger, the updated Luke(85-90). The Gospel of John, the work of Anus’s son, Justus, followed in 105.3 AsReuchlin says, ‘Jesus’ was a composite figure and the stories include elements of thetales of Joseph in Egypt and other Old Testament characters, plus some Essene writingsand characteristics of various Pagan gods. This is precisely what the evidence I havedocumented confirms. The several Josephs in the story are all the creation of Piso andpart of the code. The letters in the name Piso translate in Hebrew as Yud, Vov; Samech,Fey, and they spell the name, Joseph. Another code Piso used for himself in the stories isthe number 60. Reuchlin points out the many similarities between the Jesus story and theone of the Old Testament character, Joseph, which Piso used as a foundation: Joseph had12 brothers, Jesus 12 disciples; Joseph was sold for 20 pieces of silver, Jesus for 30pieces of silver (inflation); brother Judah suggests the sale of Joseph, Judas sells Jesus;Joseph is in Egypt where the first born are killed, Jesus and family flee to Egypt to avoidthe slaying of male children. Piso uses his four sons as the disciples, John (Julius), James(Justus), Simon-Peter (Proculus), and Alexander (Andrew).4 Julius, Justus and Proculus,would go on to write some later New Testament texts. Piso makes Jesus fulfil a numberof Old Testament prophecies, particularly those of Isaiah. Reuchlin says that the Pisosmade changes and additions to some Old Testament texts also, and wrote most of the 14Old Testament books known as the Apocrypha. These included Esdras, 1 Maccabbees,Judith, Tobit, Bel and the Dragon.5 The Pisos were Stoics (hence Stoical) and the Stoicsbelieved that people were motivated by, and controllable through, the use of fear andhope6 (the very methods of the Babylonian Brotherhood). What better way of describingthe religions which have been spawned by the Old and New Testaments?Another manifestation of Anus Piso was Flavius Josephus, the writer I have quotedonce or twice. The reason that Piso, as Josephus, and his granddaughter’s husband Plinythe Younger, do not mention Jesus in their official writings is because at the time it"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"106simply would not have been credible to do so. It was only with the passage of time asthe true origin of ‘Jesus’ was lost that the stories became accepted as ‘fact’. The officialhistory of Josephus is that he was a Judean descended from Hasmonean royalty. Hefought against the Romans and although his friends committed suicide when the revoltwent pear-shaped, he gave himself up and was spared. More than that, we are told hewas housed in Rome by the emperors for 30 years while he wrote books on Jewish‘history’ and then married his granddaughter into the Roman aristocracy. Oh, do comeon. Josephus was the Roman aristocrat, Anus Calpurnius Piso, and together with hissons and Pliny the Younger, they wrote the Gospels and the rest of the New Testament.Pliny wrote a number of the epistles (letters) under the name St Ignatius, and thissame group, under various names, were the early church ‘fathers’. And who was to turnthis Roman invention into the vast prison-religion it was to become? A Roman emperorin the same Babylonian Brotherhood as the Pisos, called Constantine the Great. Whatwas the vehicle for doing this? The Roman Church based in Rome! Geoffrey Higgins inhis epic work, Anacalypsis, shows how Rome was created as a new Babylon. Nowonder Christianity is so awash with Babylonian symbols. The whole thing was a setup to create yet another religion to entrap the human mind, and the hierarchy of theChristian Church today know all this! The Church elite have always known thisbecause they are part of the secret society stream which created the myth calledChristianity. Cynical lies like the Turin Shroud, which has been connected with theKnights Templar secret society, have been invented to perpetuate the propaganda. Theforce which invented Jesus and Christianity is the same force which still controls theworld today. For instance, the Roman College of Architects was a forerunner of today’sFreemasons, only the name has changed. The Romans used the same symbols of thesquare and compass and so on. A temple used by this college in Pompeii was lost underthe eruptions of Vesuvius in 71 AD and excavators have recovered from the temple ahexagram ‘Star of David’, a skull and a black and white tracing board first used by theDionysian Artificers.7 All these symbols are used by today’s Freemasons.The Judean battle against Rome continued until the final defeat of the Zealots in74 AD at Masada, the flat-topped mountain stronghold overlooking the Dead Sea. Itwas the last bastion of the Essene community who had evacuated their base furtherdown the coast. As the Judean Zealots were routed by the Romans, many membersof the Nazarene secret society headed into Jordan, Mesopotamia, Syria and Turkey,as documented by Julius Africanus, who lived in Turkey around 200 AD. Joseph ofArimathea, the biblical ‘uncle’ of Jesus, is said to have travelled to France to spreadthe word. The Vatican librarian, Cardinal Baronius, said that Joseph first arrived inMarseilles in 35 AD and later went on to Britain.8 ‘Mary Magdalene’ and offspringof ‘Jesus’ are also said to have headed for the South of France after the ‘crucifixion’.This is the foundation of the Holy Grail story which claims that the Jesus bloodlinebecame the Merovingians in France. Well that’s crap because these people didn’texist and note the source of this story, the librarian of the Vatican Library of theRoman Church in Rome. So what was so special suddenly about Provence and the"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"107South of France? Guess where the Piso family had extensive estates? In Gaul and, morespecifically, in... Provence!9 No wonder the ‘vine’ (bloodline/knowledge) can beidentified in this very part of France. Centuries later it became one version of the HolyGrail story of so much myth and legend. These are the symbolic stories of King Arthur(another ‘Sun’), and they can also be seen in the tarot cards and the music and art ofEurope for centuries. The Grail has been portrayed as the cup or chalice which held theblood of Jesus at the crucifixion. But this blood was merely symbolic of the bloodwhich flowed in the ancient rituals in which lambs were sacrificed at the spring equinoxand, for the more initiated, the bloodlines which go back to the reptilian ‘gods’. In theearly manuscripts of the Grail stories, the ‘Holy Grail’ is called the Sangraal. How closethis is to the Sang Raal, the Old French term meaning blood royal. This royal blood, aswe shall establish, was the bloodlines of the reptilian-human crossbreeds and hadnothing to do with ‘Jesus’.The Sun god composite, symbolically known as Jesus, was transformed into asupernatural Son of God by the man we call St Paul, whose original name in the storieswas Saul of Tarsus. Officially, St Paul was born to Judean parents and, like them, becamea Roman citizen, despite being a Pharisee and a strict adherent to the Hebrew religion.Who else was supposed to be a Judean who became a Roman? Josephus, the pseudonymfor Piso, who wrote the Gospels! St Paul, it is said, encouraged the persecution of theearly Christians, but had a conversion on the road to Damascus when Jesus miraculously‘appeared’ to him and asked: “Why do you persecute me?” However, Paul had threeversions of his story. In one he heard the voice of Jesus speak to him (Acts 9:7). Inanother he saw a great light, but without the voice (Acts 22:9). And in the third, he hasJesus giving him instructions about his future mission (Acts 26:13). Paul was the creationof Pliny the Younger (military name, Maximus) and Justus Piso.10 They introduced intoPaul’s story many of their friends and associates, and characters from the family’s history.For instance, the man called ‘Ananias’ in Acts who cures Paul of blindness was inspiredby Annaeus Seneca who died with father Piso at the hands of Nero.11 And in Romans, youfind the phrase: “Greet Herodion my kinsman”, a code for the Piso family’s connectionwith Herod the Great.12 Paul did not spread the Jesus message to Cyprus, Crete,Macedonia, Asia, Greece and Rome. Pliny and the Pisos did. Between 100 and 105Justus, his father, and Pliny, together with their family, friends and slaves, went to AsiaMinor (now Turkey), the Greek cities and Alexandria, among many other places, to‘encourage’ the poor and the slaves into joining their new faith.13 The first churches werecreated in Bithynia and Pontus by Pliny. He had visited these places a number of timesfrom the year 85 AD and this is the origin of the first name of Pontius Pilate. He was onlycalled Pilate in Matthew and Mark, the first gospels written by the Pisos, but in Luke, theone Piso wrote with Pliny, Pilate suddenly acquires the name, Pontius. Luke was writtenin the very years that Pliny began to visit Pontus.14 Pliny’s letters, written under his ownname, say that Justus Piso was in Bithynia in the years 96 and 98 using the name, TulliusJustus, and that the Pisos also located in Ephesus, the home of the cult and temple to thegoddess Diana, another version of Isis, Semiramis, Barati, ad infinitum. As they"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"108travelled they claimed to be apostles and bishops, the successors to their inventions,Peter and Paul. They claimed to be Ignatius (Pliny), Justinus (Justus), Clement of Rome(Julius), Polycarp (Proculus), and Papias (Julianus, son of Justus).15 By this time, aPiso, Pompeia Plotina (real name Claudia Phoebe), was the wife of the RomanEmperor, Trajan, and so they had tremendous support from the highest level for theirmanipulation.16 She also appears as ‘our sister Phoebe’ and as ‘Claudia’ and ‘Claudine’in the texts called Romans, Timothy and Clement.17The Pisos and Pliny introduced into their stories all the symbols of the Sun religionand Babylonian Brotherhood myths. They locate their Saul/Paul in Tarsus in AsiaMinor (now Turkey), the chief city of the Cilicians. This just happens to be a majorcentre for the Mithra Sun religion and it was the Cilicians who had taken this cult toRome, from where it spread throughout the empire. Asia Minor was also a region whichfollowed the cult of Dionysus. Both were symbolic Sun gods, born on December 25th,who died so our sins could be forgiven. Everything Christians believe about Jesus, theRomans and Persians believed about Mithra. Sunday was the sacred day for Mithraistsbecause he was a Sun God and they called this The Lord’s Day. Dionysus was born to avirgin mother, and he was known as: the Vine, Our Lord, the Saviour, the Judge of theDead, the Deliverer, the Born Again and the only begotten Son of God. Above the headof Dionysus were the words: “I am Life, Death, and Resurrection, I hold the wingedcrown (the Sun).”18 The writer, H. G. Wells, pointed out that many of the phrases usedby Paul for Jesus were the same as those used by the followers of Mithra. The Liturgyof Mithra is the Liturgy of Jesus. When Paul says: “They drank from the spiritual rockand that rock was Christ” (I Corinthians 10:4), he was using exactly the same wordsfound in the scriptures of Mithra. Only the names were changed. In the Gospels, Peterbecame the Christian ‘rock’ on whom the new church would be built. The Vatican Hillin Rome was said to be sacred to Peter, but this place was also claimed, much earlier, tobe sacred to Mithra and many Mithric remains have been found there! The Piso clanturned Mithra into Myth-ra - Christianity.All the Popes have claimed to rule as the heirs to Peter, the first Pope. This claimderives from a sentence in the Bible which has Jesus saying: “Thou art Peter, and uponthis rock I will build my church.”19 Only four verses after supposedly making Peter the‘rock’ on which he would build his church, comes this demolition of him: “But he (Jesus)turned, and said unto Peter, ‘Get thee behind me Satan: thou art an offence unto me: forthou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men’.”20 The ‘rock’ isclassic mystery school symbolism, as is the ‘corner stone’ associated with Jesus and stillused in Freemasonic symbolism today. Peter is supposed to be the custodian of the keysto Heaven, but this is just a rerun of the mystery school symbol of the two-faced Janus,custodian of the key to the Temple of Wisdom and the keys to heaven held by Mithra.And Janus was Eannus, a title for Nimrod in Babylon. The gold and silver keys of StPeter’s alleged successor, the Pope, are more symbols of the secret doctrine. The Popesand those who control them know what all this stuff really means. Gold and silver are theprecious metals used to symbolise the Sun and the Moon. Peter and Paul are both said to"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"109have been killed in Rome during the purge of Christians by the Emperor Nero, but thereis no evidence to confirm this because it didn’t happen. Two other people who weresaid to have been killed by Nero, however, were Lucius Calpurnius Piso, the head ofthe family, and his friend Annaeus Seneca! As the years passed, the Sun religion and theesoteric symbolism of the mystery schools, were transformed into a religion based onthe literal translation of symbolic texts.On this misunderstanding and deceit Christianity was built. We are led to believethat the Christian Church emerged as one unit, but this is simply not true. There weremany factions across a wide spectrum of views arguing and battling for supremacy asthe holders of ‘the truth’. The fiercest conflict ensued between the followers of the StPaul version of Jesus as the supernatural Son of God, and the Arians, who believed hewas a man, not God. The Arians were named after Anus, a churchman in Alexandria,Egypt, who questioned that Jesus could be the same as God. Had not Jehovah said thathe was the only God? How then could God be in three parts as the Father, Son and HolySpirit? The ‘trinity’ is a Pagan concept and part of Babylonian and Egyptian belief.Now if we lived in a world full of mature adults, we would allow people the respect andfreedom to believe anything they like so long as they don’t impose it on others. Justbecause we may think it is wrong or a nonsense should not matter. My problem withChristianity and religion in general is not that anyone believes it, that is their right, whatI challenge is the way it has been imposed upon people through the use of fear, guilt,violence and the suppression of alternative thought. Unfortunately, allowing people theright to believe something you don’t, has become a criminal offence and so the Paulinesand the Arians insisted on crushing each other. At this point, enter Constantine theGreat, who, together with the Pisos and Pliny, was the creator of what became known asChristianity.Constantine was made Emperor of the Roman Empire in 312 AD. He won areputation as a brave and ruthless soldier and served in Britain for a time before beingelected as Caesar of the West. He then began to kill his rivals, including many of theirchildren, as he sought to be emperor of all. In one of his battles for the Romanleadership, at Milvian Bridge near Rome, the Christian legend claims that he saw avision of a cross in the sky with the words: “By this Conquer”. The next night, so it issaid, he had a vision of Jesus who told him to put the cross on his flag to guaranteevictory over his enemies. Good story, but the word bollocks* is drifting across mymind. Constantine was said to have been converted to Christianity by his visions, butthere’s one tiny problem with that. He never did become a Christian, except perhaps onhis deathbed as a bit of insurance. He worshipped the Greek god Apollo (the Sun), andthe Sol Invictus (Unconquered Sun), and he remained to his death the PontifexMaximus of the Pagan Church! As a result, Jesus was given the Sun’s birthday ofDecember 25th which has remained ever since. Constantine is also responsible for thegreat Christian shrine in Jerusalem. His mother, Helena, was dispatched to the city to*American readers, I understand, do not know the meaning of the British term, ‘bollocks’. How can I explainit? I guess ‘you must be joking’ is the cleanest translation I can think of."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"110track down the places and relics of the Christian story. It was she who claimed to havefound the exact locations of the birth of Jesus, the crucifixion, his tomb and where heascended into the sky. You can still find them all on the guided tour of Jerusalem!Constantine built a basilica in 326 AD on the site his mother said the crucifixion tookplace and on the same spot today stands the Church of the Holy Sepulchre whichattracts millions of Christians to see where ‘Jesus died on the cross’. Helena alsoclaimed to have found the three wooden crosses around 300 years after the event. Whata clever lady she must have been.The truth went far deeper, however. Constantine was a member of the sameBabylonian Brotherhood through which the Pisos and Pliny operated. The Basilicawhich Constantine built in Jerusalem is part of the sacred geometric pattern of this cityaccording to some researchers. The Roman College of Architects were connected withthe Order of Comacine Masters who expanded rapidly under the reigns of Constantineand Theodosius as Christianity was becoming the dominant religion of the RomanEmpire.21 Both were important branches of the Brotherhood underground. The Order ofComacine based themselves on the island of Comacini in Lake Como in northern Italy.Lake Como, which today is close to the Swiss drug money laundering centres likeLugano, is a very important centre for the Babylonian Brotherhood. Two of its modernBritish members, Prince Philip and his mentor, Lord Mountbatten, attended a meetingof the Brotherhood’s Bilderberg Group at Lake Como in 1965. The Order of Comacinewas divided into lodges headed by Grand Masters and they wore white gloves andaprons and communicated through secret signs and handshakes.22 All this washappening more than a thousand years before the official creation of Freemasonry!They were given the patronage of the king of Lombardy and were made masters of allmasons and architects in Italy.23 It was this secret order, the successors to the earlierBrotherhood architects, the Dionysian Artificers, who provided the bridge betweenthose who built the ancient Pagan temples and their brethren, who would build the greatChristian cathedrals of Europe. The same Brotherhood built both! The ancient templeswere shrines to the Pagan deities, and the Christian cathedrals were also shrines to thePagan deities. The only difference was that, with the latter, the public thought they werebuilt to worship ‘Jesus’. The famous Christian hero, St Bernard, defined God as ‘length,width, height and depth’ because he understood the effect of geometry and numbers onthe energy fields. Pythagoras also stated that: “number is all”. The power of pattern,numbers, geometry and proportion, are some of the ‘great mysteries’ that have beendenied the mass of the people.Clearly Constantine, and the Brotherhood which controlled the emperors, saw politicaladvantage in supporting the Christian movement. And the people would have had noproblem encompassing Jesus into their belief system because the story matched that of theother Sun gods of the time, including Mithra. Christianity picked up many followers ofMithra because to them it was no different to what they already believed except for thename. Constantine ended the persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire by issuing hisEdict of Milan, but this was not specific to Christianity, though it stopped the persecution"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"111against all one-God religions. Anyway, as one persecution ended another was soon tobegin, as the Roman Church persecuted, burned and tortured anyone who refused tobelieve in the Christian faith, or even their version of the faith. Tens of millions ofpeople have died in the name of the so-called ‘Prince of Peace’. Appropriately,Constantine murdered his wife and elder son before making the journey in 325 AD tohis palace at Nicaea (now Iznik in Turkey) to decide what Christians to this day mustbelieve. He wanted to end the conflict between the Paulines and the Arians and install asingle Christian creed. He called 318 bishops (another mystical number) together atNicaea to tell them what their creed was going to be. Bitter arguments erupted betweenthe factions on the burning issue for the future of the world: Was Jesus part of a trinityof Father, Son and Holy Ghost? Holy shit. Documents were torn up and blows werestruck. If you are a Christian, this is how your faith was decided. The Arians lost theday and out of this mayhem and Roman dictatorship came the foundation belief ofChristianity, the Nicene Creed. This dog’s breakfast was as follows. I hope you areconcentrating, I’ll be asking questions later:“We believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of all things, both visible and invisible;and in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the son of God, begotten of the Father, only begotten, thatis to say, of the same substance of the Father, God of God and Light of Light, Very God ofVery God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the father, by whom all thingswere made, both things in heaven and things on earth; who, for us men and our salvation,came down and made flesh, made man, suffered and rose again on the third day, went upto the heavens, and is to come again to judge the quick and the dead; and in the holyghost.”Simple eh? It was decided that Jesus was the same substance as the father because inancient Babylon it was said that Nimrod and his son, Tammuz, were the same person.His mother, Queen Semiramis, was titled the Holy Spirit. So the Father, Son and HolyGhost, are in fact Nimrod-Tammuz and Semiramis. Christianity is the religion ofBabylon and has been from the start. Today Rome and Italy remain a majorBrotherhood centre, as I detail in .. And The Truth Shall Set You Free. The Vatican itselfis wholly controlled by the Brotherhood and one of its most important bases.Christianity, like Judaism and Islam, was designed to achieve another vital part ofthe reptilian Agenda: the suppression of the female energy, the intuitive connection tohigher levels of our multidimensional consciousness. Once you suppress your feminineenergy, your intuition, you switch off your higher consciousness and become dominatedby your lower consciousness. You are isolated from your highest expression of love,wisdom and knowledge, and at the mercy of the manipulated ‘information’ bombardingyour eyes and ears. This is why the Brotherhood have sought to create a world in whichthe male energy has called the shots, on the surface at least. The state of being we knowas ‘macho man’ is a person disconnected from his female energy and therefore deeplyimbalanced. Note that there is no mention of women in Constantine’s Nicene Creed. It"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"112says that God became flesh as Jesus “for us men and our salvation”. Christianity was amale bastion from its very foundation, created to suppress the balancing female energy.The early founders of the Church, like Quintus Tertullian, banned women from priestlyoffice and even speaking in church. It was only at the Council of Trent in 1545 that theRoman Church officially agreed that women had souls and then only by a majority ofthree votes! The seeds of this anti-feminine dogma in the Christian Church can be seenin its mirror, Zoroasterism, the sect of the prophet (mythical Sun god), Zoroaster. Heand his religion emerged yet again from Persia, now Turkey, the home of the TaurusMountains and St Paul’s abode, Tarsus. Zoroaster was vehemently anti-women and hesaid that “no women could enter Heaven except those ‘submissive to control, who hadconsidered their husbands lords”’. This whole philosophy is an almost word-for-wordrepeat of Brahmanism, the appalling Hindu creed which was introduced by the Aryansto India many centuries before. St Paul (the Pisos and Pliny) continued the anti-feminine agenda in Christianity and set the scene for the horrific suppression of womenover nearly two thousand years. Among St Paul’s little gems are:“Wives submit to your husbands for the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is thehead of the Church. Now if the Church submits to Christ so should wives submit to theirhusbands in everything.”And:“But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be insilence.”The Christian Church was built to represent and perpetuate the extreme male vibration,the Sun energy, and to keep the ancient knowledge secret. The Christian Church became acrucial and highly effective vehicle to remove knowledge from circulation so it could beused secretly and malevolently from behind the scenes. The assault on the balancingfemale energy and the hoarding of knowledge resulted in the persecution of ‘witches’ -channellers, mediums, psychics and seers of all kinds. These communications with otherrealms had been an everyday part of pre-Christian life. Channellers were given names likeprophets, oracles, vessels of God and such like. One of the leaders of this witch-hunt wasJerome, born in 341, who is credited with gathering the texts for the main Latin version ofthe ‘Holy Bible’. It was Jerome who persuaded the Pope to outlaw channelling (psychiccommunications with other dimensions). By this single papal decree, the vessels of Godbecame vessels and witches of the Devil, terms still used by many Christians. King JamesI, the first king of both England and Scotland, included a bitter condemnation of witchesin his King James Bible in 1611 and he was true to his word as he had thousands ofwomen tortured and executed for being witches. Jerome wanted the priests to be themiddle men between humanity and God. He did not want people going direct,contradicting the official line, or circulating unapproved knowledge. As he said:"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"113“We tell them (the channellers) that we do not so much reject prophecy, as refuse toreceive prophets whose utterances fail to accord with the Scriptures old and new.“24Yet at the same time the initiates of the Babylonian Brotherhood which created theRoman Church were using these same psychic powers and modes of inter-dimensionalcommunication. OK, how else can we control and diminish the great unwashed? We’vegot them to believe a fantasy about Jesus and we’ve conned them to think that after onelife on Earth, God decides if they go to heaven or hell. We have also conned them to thinkthat we, the men in frocks, know how God wants them to live and that anything to dowith the esoteric is the Devil. Anything else? Hey, we need to be careful about that sexualenergy, the creative force. Got to shut that down or their power source will still be there.I’ve got just the man. I say, Augustine, in my office, please. Saint Augustine of Hippo,like most of the early Church heroes, was from North Africa. He couldn’t get enough sexearlier in his life, but after his alleged conversion to Christianity at the age of 31, heswitched dramatically and decided that sex was horrid. You know what smokers are likewhen they stop. He would not allow a woman into his house unaccompanied, even hissister. He couldn’t think of another way of producing children, so unless the race was todie out, he was stuck with it. However, he insisted that on no account should you enjoy it.I’ve tried that mate, and it doesn’t work. This was Augustine’s view of sexuality:“Husbands love your wives, but love them chastely. Insist on the work of the flesh only insuch measure as is necessary for the procreation of children. Since you cannot begetchildren in any other way, you must descend to it against your will, for it is the punishmentof Adam.”These attitudes led, in stages, to the imposition of celibacy on priests by Pope GregoryVII in 1074. Yes, we have celibate priests in the Roman Catholic Church today because ofwhat one pope decided a thousand years ago and countless children, abused by sexuallyfrustrated and messed up churchmen, have taken the consequences. Augustine connectedsex with original sin, the idea that we are born sinners because of our link back to Adamand Eve. Jesus, so this theory goes, was the only one born without original sin because hewas conceived by a virgin birth. But what about his mother? She must have had originalsin and so some of it must have been passed on to him. Eventually, the Roman Churchcould see the contradiction and they decreed that Mary, too, was a virgin birth. But whatabout her mother? Did she have original sin? If so, it must have been passed on to Mary.My God, please stop me before I disappear up my own orifice. What garbage it all is. Butbillions of people have been controlled and manipulated in this way since the Christiancreed sank its fangs of fear, guilt and violence, deep into the human spirit. Actually Ibelieve-in original sin myself. Some of my ‘sins’ have been very original. If you are goingto sin, make it original, that’s what I say.Our spiritual, mental, emotional and physical levels of being are connected byvortices of energy known as chakras (a Sanskrit word meaning: wheels of light). It is"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"114through these chakra vortices that imbalances on one level are passed on to another (seeFigure 18). Thus when we get very emotionally stressed, the first thing that happens isthat we stop thinking straight. The imbalance on the emotional level is transmitted to themental level. This is eventually passed onto the physical level if the imbalance is notcorrected and this is how stress and emotional upset causes illness and disease or dis-ease. These emotional imbalances manifest in the physical body as chemical reactionsand it is these reactions that official medicine (the transnational drug corporations) seeksto ‘treat’ at unbelievable cost in both money and long term effects on the body. Theytreat the symptom, not the cause, because most doctors are so in-doctor-rinated that theyhave no idea how the body really works and what the human being really is. Those thatcontrol the drug corporations do know, however, and they use every means possible tosuppress ‘alternative’ healing methods which treat the cause and not the symptom.It is also the chakras which suck energy into our consciousness field and in a fullyfunctioning state we take in vast amounts of energy, particularly through the basechakra at the bottom of the spine. From there it moves through the seven major chakrasgoing up along the spine and out through the crown chakra at the top of the head. Iexplain all this in detail in other books like I Am Me I Am Free. For reasons I will gointo in a later chapter, the more energywe suck into our energy field, themore power we have to create andcontrol our own destiny. It is vital,therefore, that those who wish todiminish and dominate us find ways tolimit the amount of energy we absorb.This is where the manipulation of sexcomes in. The three lowest chakras arethe base, the sexual chakra just abovethat, and then the chakra connected toour emotional level in the solar plexus.It is this chakra which stimulates the‘butterflies’ and ‘nervous stomachs’when we are worried or stressed. Sothe Christian and ‘moral’ attitudes tosex close down the base chakra andwhat energy it does absorb is throwninto turmoil when it hits the sexualand emotional chakras because of allthe fear and guilt surrounding thesubject. This imbalances anddiminishes the entire human energy-consciousness field. Most Christianclerics have no idea that this is so, butFigure 18: The human ‘chakra’ or vortex system whichinterpenetrates our levels of being.

But sex is wonderful. It is to be enjoyed. The ability toexpress your love physically for another human being is an incredible gift. I don’t carewhat your sexuality may be. Love is love is love. Let’s express it. If Augustine or thePope want to tie a knot in theirs, fair enough, everyone to their own, as long as theydon’t tell me how to live my life.In the East, Asia and China, they have retained the understanding of the power ofsexual energy over thousands of years and this knowledge has been practised in theWest in the secret societies and Satanic rituals. Once again the sexual energy is just that,energy, and can be used to create or destroy. In the Eastern religions, the consciouscreation and stimulation of sexual energy is known as Tantra. Sexual intercourse isseen, quite rightly, as the union and balance of the male and female, the yang (male)and yin (female). The idea of Tantric sex is to stimulate the sexual energy held in thebase of the spine, the Kundalini energy as it has become known. This was symbolisedas uncurling serpents and in Tantra the participants control and delay orgasm totransform the kundalini from its original state (ching) into the higher energy (ch’i) andfinally its highest expression (shen). This is done by raising the energy up the spine anddown again until it has reached a vibratory state that can reconnect the person with thecosmos. By the end of this book you will see the importance of this and its scientificbasis. When the kundalini explodes into your energy field as it did with me in 1990-91,it can blow you away mentally, emotionally and spiritually, sometimes physically too,until you have mastered its power. Stimulating the kundalini is described as ‘lightingthe inner fire’. Mine wasn’t a fire, it was a nuclear strike! Tantra is designed to completethis process in a more controlled way, but sometimes the uncontrolled way offers amore extreme and enlightening experience. Once the Kundalini is awakened, you havea constant supply of enormously powerful energy with which to create whatever youchoose. The Satanists use sex as a fundamental part of their ritual so they can tap thissexual, kundalini force, for their horrendous purposes. But it can equally be used to setus free and hence the Christian obsession with making sex into a dirty, immoral, guilt-ridden experience which suppresses or imbalances the kundalini energy and delinks theperson from their cosmic levels of self.The compilation of the Bible was yet another farce. If you ask most people about theGospel writers, they will usually tell you that Matthew, Mark, Luke and John were thedisciples of Jesus. That’s the impression people get and are encouraged to get, but it’s nottrue and not even the Church claims that officially. The Gospels and other books of theBible are only those chosen by the hierarchy of the Christian Church from those writtenby the Pisos and Pliny and the many copies and offshoots which followed. Many othertexts were available that were just as valid, often very much more so, than those whichmade it into the ‘Holy Book’. Texts were rejected, destroyed or rewritten to fit the official"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"116line and the philosopher, Celsus, wrote of the church leaders in the third century:“You utter fables, and you do not even possess the art of making them seem likely... Youhave altered three, four times and oftener, the texts of your own Gospels in order to denyobjections to you.”25In 1958, a manuscript was discovered at a monastery at Mar Saba, east of Jerusalem,which shows how the Jesus story was rewritten by the Church whenever it suited themat the time. It was found by an American, Morton Smith,26 Professor of Ancient Historyat Columbia University, and it included the content of a letter by Bishop Clement ofAlexandria, Egypt, an early Christian father, to a colleague called Theodore. It alsorevealed an unknown segment of Mark’s Gospel which had been suppressed. Itincluded in the ‘Jesus’ story some details of mystery school initiations and it was anaccount of the raising of Lazarus by Jesus, the famous raising from the dead. In thissuppressed text Lazarus called to Jesus before any ‘raising’ took place, so proving thathe was not supposed to be physically dead. There was also another devastatingrevelation for Christianity. The manuscript makes references to the effect that Jesus wasunderstood to have engaged in possible homosexual practices involving the ‘rich youngman’ mentioned in Mark’s Gospel.27 Let me stress that I am not condemninghomosexuality here. Good luck to those who wish to live their lives in this way so longas it’s the choice of all concerned. I am making the point that the Christian hierarchyhave been deceiving and lying to their followers right from the start. Bishop Clement’sletter was replying to a Christian who was very perturbed to be told the above story of‘Jesus’ by the Gnostic group called the Carpocrates. It had apparently been leaked tothem by an official in Alexandria. Clement’s advice, after confirming the story, was thatanything which contradicts the official church view must be denied, even if it is true.The letter says of those who question official orthodoxy:“For even if they should say something true, one who loves the Truth should not, even so,agree with them... To them one must never give way; nor, when they put forward theirfalsifications, should one concede that the secret Gospel is by Mark - but should deny it onoath. For not all true things are to be said to all men.”28Clement was summing up the attitude of the Brotherhood and their religiousfronts throughout history. Most members of the Church follow the party line becausethat is what they are cond{tioned to believe, but within these ‘religions’ are the secretsects which know the truth. They are organisations within organisations or anorganisation (the reptilian Brotherhood) within organisations. It was such peoplewho created the religion in the first place and compiled and translated the Bible, thebook that was to mind control the world for centuries and, to a very large extent, stilldoes. Jerome became secretary to Pope Damasus in about 382 and he wascommissioned to bring various texts together to produce the Bible in Latin, the"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"117official language of Rome. Now we had another translation, the Hebrew and Greekinto Latin, plus Jerome’s own prejudices. His version is known as the Vulgate, from theLatin Vulgata, meaning in common use. The English derivative, vulgar, meaning ‘inpoor taste’, would have been a better description. Jerome edited the texts as he saw fitand rejected those which didn’t support the creed of Nicaea. He worked with anotherchurch ‘father’, the sex bomb, Augustine. Jerome and Augustine both agreed thatwomen were morally and spiritually inferior and that sex and earthly pleasures were asource of evil which kept men from their spiritual path. Poor sods. They examined 13gospels, nine acts and teachings of the Apostles, plus 31 letters and other writings. Theydecided which were ‘orthodox’ and which were to be rejected. Their choice wassupported by the Council of Carthage in 397 and confirmed again by Pope Innocent I ahundred years later. Jerome’s Vulgate Bible became widely accepted as the version. TheCouncil of Trent in 1545 decreed that it was the only acceptable one for RomanCatholics.Most Christians could not understand what it said because they didn’t read Latin, butthey could rely on the priests to tell them what it said they should do. People werecondemned and killed for the crime of translating the Bible into English because doingso allowed millions to actually read the texts the priests were using to control andterrify them. In 553 AD, the belief in reincarnation was outlawed at the Second SynodCouncil of Constantinople under the influence of the Emperor Justinian. The councildecided, without the attendance of the Pope, that: “If anyone assert the fabulous pre-existence of souls and shall submit to the monstrous doctrine that follows from it, lethim be... excommunicated”. The ‘monstrous doctrine’ was that we live forever on aneternal journey of evolution through experience and we are all responsible for ouractions in this physical life or a future one. An acceptance of reincarnation took awaythe power of the heaven or hell mob to frighten people into doing as they, sorry, ‘God’,said. The knowledge continued to be sucked from the public domain. After Constantinethe Great, came other emperors who influenced the course of the fast emergingChristian creed. Among them was Theodosius who made Christianity the officialreligion of the empire in 380. The power of the men in frocks grew enormously as theBabylonian priesthood dropped anchor in Rome. Anyone who strayed even marginallyfrom the official beliefs was brutally executed and their documents destroyed - exactlythe Nimrod doctrine of Babylon. This is not just a bunch of power crazed psychopaths,ad-libbing their way through this grotesque slaughter, it was a coldly calculated plan torule by terror and in doing so, take any other knowledge or versions of life out of publiccirculation. As reptilians and the puppets of reptilians, they wanted to create a mentaland emotional prison cell, outside of which it was fatal to tread.The marauding Visigoths, a Germanic (Aryan) people who occupied southernFrance, eventually sacked Rome in 410, but by then the Roman Church had such a gripon the minds of so many in the former Roman Empire, that where the Roman emperorsleft off, the Popes would take over. The Roman dictatorship became a papal dictatorshipand in the centuries that followed, Europe became a landscape of untold slaughter. The"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"118Pope ruled and who ruled the Pope? The Babylonian Brotherhood, exactly as they dotoday. The Hebrew and Christian religions are the inventions of those who controlledthe underground stream of secret knowledge. Even the ritual garbs are the same in somany ways. What do Jewish people wear? Skull caps. What does the Pope wear? Askull cap. This is symbolic of the way priests in the mystery schools used to shave thebacks of their heads. The more formal headgear and ritual of Judaism and Christianityare also very similar because they originate from the same source and the Pope’s mitreis the fish head symbol of Nimrod.To complete the trio, along came the skull-cap-wearing Muslims and the creed ofIslam, inspired by the ‘Prophet’ Mahomet (Mohammed) when he had a ‘vision’ in theyear 612. Once more we find that Islam’s roots are in Christianity and Judaism andtherefore Babylon. Muslims see Islam as an updated continuation of theJudeo-Christian stream and they, too, trace their ancestry back to our old mate,Abraham, who is said to have emerged from the Sumerian city of Ur and headed forEgypt. They believe that Abraham built the Kaaba, the sacred shrine at Mecca, and thefocus of pilgrimage for Muslims all over the world. But it was in fact originally a Pagantemple of goddess (Semiramis) worship featuring the famous Black Stone. W. WynnWestcott, founder of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, wrote in his work, TheMagical Mason, that the Black Stone supposed to have been brought to Mecca byAbraham, was used originally for ancient Pagan ritual.29 Again you see Brotherhoodsymbolism in this ‘new’ religion. The symbols of the crescent and the curved sword, thescimitar, are identified with the Moon and Venus, the Morning Star, the term used forLucifer. Venus was also a title for Queen Semiramis. Muslims have bought the idea thatMoses, King David and Jesus were divine prophets sent by the one All Mighty God,when in fact all three are Brotherhood inventions. Their holy book, the Koran, whichwas supposed to be inspired by God, mentions Jesus in 93 verses and treats him as aliving person. Islam was created by the same Brotherhood networks as the Christianreligions, to further imprison, divide and rule. Mohammed was the last prophet andtherefore, the Muslims reckon, the most valid. As such, all Christians and Jews shouldconvert to Islam, the orthodox Muslims demand. The term, Jihad, is the ‘Holy War’ thatMuslims are urged to wage against all who do not accept the creed of Mohammed. Howfitting that Islam means ‘to submit or surrender’ and Muslim means ‘one who submits’.Some of the bloodiest conflict in history has resulted from the desire of Islam,Christianity and Judaism to impose their creed on each other, when they all come fromthe same source and the same manipulation! Excuse me, did I come in late and misssomething? Beam me up Scotty, get me out of here...The Islamic god Allah is the same ‘god’, the Muslims say, as the Judeo-Christian,Jehovah. The Koran is the Islamic holy book, but Muslims also give credence to thePentateuch, the first five books of the Old Testament attributed to Moses. In truth theywere written by the Levites after Babylon and not by ‘Moses’, which was a title in theEgyptian mystery schools. Is it really a coincidence that these three massive prisons ofthe mind, suppressors of the female, and creators of bloody conflict, should all come"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"119from the same part of the world? Or that people having visions and visitations shouldplay such a crucial part in the formation and legend which created these monsters?Mohammed said he had his vision near the cave where he used to go. Caves and darkplaces constantly recur in stories of religious superstars and Sun gods like Mithra andJesus. Mohammed said his visitor claimed to be the Angel Gabriel of biblical fameand during the encounter Mohammed said he lost consciousness and entered a trancestate. While Mohammed was in his trance or hypnotic state, ‘Gabriel’ gave him amessage to remember and recite. Mohammed said that when he awoke the messagewas inscribed upon his heart. What followed the encounter with ‘Gabriel’ was abloodbath spanning the centuries to the present day, as Mohammed and hissuccessors sought to impose their creed on the world. Islam is not the opposite ofChristianity and Judaism, they are all ‘oppo-sames’: the same state of mind with adifferent name, ultimately controlled by the same people, the reptilians. Islam isanother mystery school religion, its texts written in esoteric code for the masses totake literally. There were times in later centuries when some of this secret knowledgewas allowed into the public domain by more enlightened Muslim leaders and thiswas the inspiration for the advanced societies and science which came out of MuslimSpain and Baghdad. Today, part of the Brotherhood Agenda is to stimulate conflictwith the Islamic nations by causing division between the Muslim and Christian-Jewish world.The Mormon Church is another ‘vision’ religion which very powerfully locks intothe Brotherhood network, as all religions do. The Mormon Church, or more formally,the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, was founded by Joseph Smith after heclaimed an ‘angel’ called Moroni appeared to him in 1823. Moroni, he said, told him ofthe existence of a book of gold plates containing: “the fullness of the everlastinggospel” and “an account of the former inhabitants of this continent and the sources fromwhich they sprang”. The location was revealed to him, and in 1827 with help from two‘magic stones’ called Urim and Thummim, he translated the plates into English. Urimand Thummim were, in fact, the names of knucklebones or dice used by Levite priestsand the Kings of Israel were said to follow their prophecies. They were used in themystery school holy place known as the Tabernacle. Here we have yet another religionoriginating from the same source and another perpetuation of the Jesus myth. The goldplates, Smith said, were written in ‘reformed Egyptian’. From this came the Book ofMormon two years later and his followers became the Mormon Church in 1830. Thepillars of the early church were Smith and another guy called Brigham Young. Theywere both high degree Freemasons from the key New York Lodge and the expansion ofthis church was funded by Kuhn, Loeb and Company, the Rothschild Bank in theUnited States30 which also helped to fund the Russian Revolution and both sides in theFirst World War. The Mormons were a Brotherhood creation. Mormons recognise theBible, but claim that Smith’s writings are equally divine. They set up communitiescalled Stakes of Zion (Sion, the Sun) and eventually settled in Salt Lake City, Utah, theMormon city from where its mind control programmes are orchestrated, as I shall"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"120document in a later chapter. Funny how all these religions are justified by a vision orvisitation, followed by an extreme, dogmatic and autocratic religion which rules by fear,indoctrination and mind manipulation.Another mind control sect which emerged from Christianity/Judaism is theJehovah’s Witnesses, the worship of the Hebrew angry god, Jehovah, and one of theirleading founders was the paedophile Charles Taze Russell, a high degree Freemason.These religions were set up to control, to create conflict between people, and to divideand rule the masses. Visions of biblical characters like the Virgin Mary which haveenhanced mainstream Christian beliefs over the centuries have followed a similarpattern. We have no idea what the Jesus ‘team’ looked like, but people always see themas their classic artistic depiction. Those who have seen visions which relate to the Biblestories have had shrines built to them, but those who see visions which are not biblicalare condemned as working with the Devil. William Cooper, a former operative withUnited States Naval Intelligence, said he had seen secret documents which claim thatextraterrestrials had told the US authorities that they had manipulated the human racevia religion, Satanism, witchcraft, magic and the occult. Certainly, the human race hasbeen manipulated and controlled through religion and Satanism. The only question is,are extraterrestrials (or inner-terrestrials) behind this? As Cooper asks: “...were theyindeed the source of our religions with which they had been manipulating us allalong?”31The answer, I would suggest, is a very loud: “Yes”.SOURCES1Abelard Reuchlm, The True Authorship Of The New Testament (the Abelard ReuchlmFoundation, P0 Box 5652, Kent, WA, USA, 1979).2Ibid, p 1.3Ibid, pp 4-5.4Ibid, p 12.5Ibid, p 5.6Ibid, p 22.7Michael Howard, The Occult Conspiracy (Destiny Books, Rochester, Vermont, 1989), p 18.8Bloodline Of The Holy Grail, p 132.9The True Authorship Of The New Testament, p ii.10Ibid, p 14.11Acts 9: 17-18.12Romans 16: 11."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"12113The True Authorship Of The New Testament, p 15.14Ibid, p 15.15Ibid, p 16.16Ibid, p 15.17Ibid, p 27.18Arthur Findlay, The Curse Of Ignorance, A History Of Mankind (Headquarters PublishingCompany, London, first published 1947), Volume I, p 549.19Matthew 16:18-19.20Matthewl6:23.21The Occult Conspiracy, p 18.22Ibid.23Ibid.24The Curse Of Ignorance, Volume I, p 636.25Ibid, p 637.26Morton Smith, The Book Your Church Doesn’t Want You To Read, p 176.27MarklO:17-23.28Morton Smith, The Secret Gospel (Victor Gollancz, London, 1974).29Quoted by Euctace Mullins in The Curse Of Canaan (Revelation Books, P0 Box 11105,Staunton, VA), p 44.30Fritz Springmeier, The Top 13 Illuminati Bloodlines (Springmeier, Lincoln, Portland, Oregon,1995), p 151.31William Cooper, Behold A Pale Horse (Light Technology Publishing, P0 Box 1495, Sedona,Arizona, USA, 1991), pp 212-213."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"122CHAPTER SIXRule BritanniaAs the religions were firmly established and controlling the masses in the first centuriesof the AD era, the expansion of the Babylonian Brotherhood accelerated on the politicaland financial fronts, also.Vital to this expansion was another branch of the reptilian full-bloods andcrossbreeds who made their way over land and many centuries to New Troy -London -via Italy, Switzerland, Germany and the Netherlands. These were Nimrod worshippersand, appropriately, the very name of Italy derives from the word bull -a Nimrodsymbol.Once again they travelled under the heading of Phoenicians and they settled in thenorth of Italy in 466 AD in what is now Venice. These Phoenicians then became knownas Venetians. They built a powerful maritime (of course) and financial empire whichwas based on lending people money that does not exist and charging them interest on it.This is another common theme of the Babylonian Brotherhood over thousands of yearsand today this financial scam controls the purse strings of the planet. When you go to abank for a loan, the bank does not print a single new note or mint a single new coin. Itsimply types into your account the size of the loan and from that moment you start topay interest on what is nothing more than figures on a screen. The bank has created‘money’ out of nothing and insist that you pay them for doing so. If anyone else didthat, they would be arrested for fraud, but the banks do it every day quite legally. Thissystem was employed in Babylon and it has been expanded over thousands of years. Ithas rarely been challenged because the Brotherhood which devised this system havealso controlled the kings, queens and leading politicians, who have imposed it on thepeople. More than that, the Brotherhood are the kings, queens and leading politicians!The ‘money’ created in this way is known as ‘fiat’ money.The Phoenician-Venetians, under the control of the Babylonian Brotherhood,expanded their wealth and power by war, assassinations, piracy and by ruthlesslymanipulating trade and money. They would support a country when it suited them andthen immediately seek to destroy it if that advanced their Agenda. One of theircommon methods was to bankrupt any person, business or country that opposedthem. If that sounds exactly like the methods in use globally today, there is a reasonfor that. The same Brotherhood now control the world banking and trading system viathe central banking network, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, theWorld Trade Organisation, the Bank of International Settlements and so on. The"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"123reptile-Aryans of Venice married into the nobility, bought themselves titles, and simplyinvented others. As a result, from around 1171, they became known throughout Europeas the ‘Black Nobility’. Once again the Phoenicians (or rather the reptile-Phoenicians)became the aristocracy. They operated across northern Italy to Genoa and into an areathat became known as Lombardy, going north into what is now Switzerland. Lombardis still a word widely used in the financial industry and Lombard Street is one of thebest known streets in the City of London financial centre. Northern Italy or Lombardywas the region invaded around the fourth century BC by Aryan ‘Celts’ called theLombards who brought an influx of Nordic blood from Germany. They were laterabsorbed by another Aryan people, the Franks, from where we get the name France. Inshort, they were different branches of the same white race with the reptile-Aryans,unknown to the rest of the population, invariably at the helm. As today, these reptiliansand reptilian puppets looked human, but they were controlled within by a very differentforce working to a long term Agenda. Long term in our perception, anyway.Switzerland remains a fundamentally important financial stronghold for theBrotherhood. This is why it is never attacked and never takes part in wars, even whenevery country along its borders is involved. Switzerland is a major financial centre forthe people who are creating the wars and so they ensure it is not involved. See howsimple history becomes when you know the Agenda!Venice was for centuries a hub of the reptile bloodlines who expanded into the FarEast with the journeys of the Venetian, Marco Polo, of whom there is far more to knowthan official history suggests. The surviving royal families in Europe are the reptilebloodline of this Black Nobility, including Britain’s House of Windsor. This is whythese royal houses, including the Windsors, are rife with Satanism and fundamentallyconnected with Freemasonry and other Elite secret societies. I will chart the history ofthe Windsors, their grotesque record of manipulation, and their reptilian-Satanicactivities, in a later chapter. The Black Nobility established close relationships with thebloodline families of Britain and they were behind the invasion in 1066 by anotherbranch of their ‘family’, the Normans of William the Conqueror and the St Clairs, afamily of Viking descent. Once again the Black Nobility married into the Britisharistocratic families, awarded themselves titles, or invented them out of nothing. Twofamilies were especially important in the Black Nobility takeover of Britain, the Savoysand the Estes. The Savoys (after which the famous London hotel is named) ruled Italyfrom 1146 to 1945 and the Estes ruled the region called Ferrara from the ilOOs until1860 when Italy became one country. There are countless examples of how the BlackNobility infiltrated and took over Britain. Eleanor, the daughter of Peter, the ninthCount of Savoy, married the English king, Henry III. Peter ‘Savoy’, the Black Nobilitycount, was given large estates in England by Henry after he married his daughter andthis included the title of the Earl of Richmond. From this foothold the Black Nobilitycount, now the Earl of Richmond, arranged a series of other marriages between theBlack Nobility and the English aristocracy. His younger brother, Boniface, was evenmade Archbishop of Canterbury! The Black Nobility have been controlling the Church"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"124of England for centuries, indeed from the start, and today one of their most activerepresentatives, Queen Elizabeth II, is still the official head of the Church. The BlackNobility bloodlines are reptilian full-bloods and crossbreeds and pure BabylonianBrotherhood. They seized the reins of power in Europe to take their Agenda intoanother stage.The founders of the European royal houses, many of which continue to this day,were Rupert, the Count of Nassau, and Christian, Count of Oldenbourg. Both lived inthe 11th and 12th centuries, the very period when the Black Nobility-BabylonianBrotherhood launched its plan to control the whole of Europe. From Rupert came theHesse-Darmstadt and Hesse-Cassal lines, the Dukes of Luxembourg, the Battenborgs/Battenbergs (later Mountbattens), the Prince of Orange and Nassau, and the Kings ofthe Netherlands. From Christian came the Kings of Denmark and Norway, theSchleswig-Holstein line and the Hanovers, who became Kings of England. It was fromthe Hanovers that the present House of Windsor is derived. Other Black Nobility-reptilebloodlines included the Dukes of Normandy (like William the Conqueror, hence theirsupport for him and the St Clairs), the Saxe-Coburgs (another Windsor bloodline), andthe Plantagenets who produced the Tudor and Stuart monarchs of England. Here yousee how the English aristocracy and the monarchs on the English throne have in factbeen the Black Nobility. The Scottish nobility, the clans and the ruling aristocraticfamilies like the St Clairs, the Bruces and others I have mentioned, are also the BlackNobility in disguise, the reptile-Aryans from the ancient world. Of course they fightamong themselves for power and many of them will not be aware of who they are andwhat is controlling them, but they are the same Anunnaki-reptilian bloodlines andinvariably find themselves in the positions of royal, religious and political power.Many of today’s most famous financial and business families are members of theBlack Nobility lines of the Babylonian Brotherhood. The Warburg banking dynasty is infact of the Abraham del Banco family, the biggest banking family in Venice when the citywas at the height of its powers and influence. The Agnelli family, famous for the car giant,Fiat (remember fiat money?), is another of these Black Nobility bloodlines. This is whythe Agnellis control Italy and dictate to its governments. Another of the most powerfulBlack Nobility families of Venice were the de Medicis and it was they who sponsored thejourney of Christopher Columbus to ‘discover’ the Americas. The reason for that willbecome clear soon. The de Medicis also sponsored the artist, Leonardo da Vinci, a leadinginitiate of the secret society network. Da Vinci was able to predict some of the futuredevelopment of technology because he knew what most of the public were not allowed toknow. His famous depiction of the man within the circle was symbolic of the goldenmean geometry on which the major sacred sites of the world are designed and located.The influence of the Black Nobility expanded northwards into Germany and it isfrom this stream that the British royal family, the House of Windsor, originates. Untilthey changed their name in 1917, they were called the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, aGerman royal line going back to the Black Nobility of Venice-Lombardy and beyondthat to Babylon. The Windsors are reptilian full-bloods and they know it. When the"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"125Black Nobility expanded into Germany, the del Banco family of Venice became knownas the Warburgs. Although they claim to be Jewish, the Warburgs are in fact a reptile-Aryan bloodline. This explains why they became bankers to Adolf Hitler and why otherreptile-Aryan families like the Rothschilds claim to be Jewish while funding andsupporting people like Hitler. (See .. And The Truth Shall Set You Free for the detailedbackground to this.) In 1998 while on a speaking tour of South Africa, I was invited tohave a private meeting with P. W. Botha, the President of South Africa during the1980s, who wished to give me information about who controls that country. He told methat during his presidency he was asked to host a delegation of the English Rothschildsin Cape Town. At that meeting they told him that money which once belonged toGerman Jews was sitting in Swiss bank accounts and it was available for investment inSouth Africa if they could agree an interest rate. Botha said he was outraged andrefused to play. But this was the money that has been recently located in Swiss banksand was stolen from the Jews who suffered under Hitler. The Rothschilds have beenlending it and making money from it since the war. That, my friends, is what theRothschilds think of Jewish people and yet to expose the Rothschilds is to be branded‘anti-Semitic’ by both Jewish people who have no idea how they are being manipulated,and by the self-righteous, self-indulgent ‘Robot Radicals’, better known as the politicalleft. For a definition of how the ‘left’ think and behave, see any definition of how thepolitical ‘right’ think and behav& The Rothschilds were formerly known as the Bauers,one of the most famous occult families of Middle Ages Germany, and they originate notfrom Israel, but the Caucasus Mountains. They are shape-shifting reptilians hidingbehind human form. The Elite Brotherhood families change their names from time totime to ensure that people won’t realise that the same bloodlines holding the positionsof power weave their way through history.The Black Nobility made its centre for a time in Amsterdam. Again many of themclaimed to be Jews, but they were not, they were Aryan bloodlines which had journeyedthere by various routes. Some originated from the Phoenician-Venetians and some werethe Khazar Aryans from the Caucasus Mountains where their ancestors had massconverted to Judaism in the 8th century. What we call Judaism is just another offshootof the Sun religion of the Aryans, as is Christianity. The leadership in Amsterdam wasthe successors to the black magicians of Babylon. They were reptilians operatingmostly, but certainly not always, within the white race. It was while the Black Nobilityhad their base in Amsterdam that the Dutch people were used to begin the whitesettlement of South Africa. In 1689, one of this Black Nobility, called William ofOrange, was manipulated onto the throne of England and at this time the reptile-Aryanleadership in Amsterdam moved to London to connect with the other reptile-Aryanbloodlines who had settled in London and Britain thousands of years before. Londonbecame even more the epicentre of their increasingly global operations. It was after thisthat British people were used to settle South’ Africa and they went to war with theDutch people there, the Boers, to establish control. Both peoples involved were pawnsin a game they did not understand and their successors still don’t. William of Orange"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"126landed in England or Barat-land, on the shores of Torbay in 1688, the same place thatthe Trojan, Brutus, had landed when he came to establish London as his New Troyabout 1,103 BC. Still today there is a statue of William of Orange in the fishing port ofBrixham to commemorate his arrival near that spot. William was, of course, a student ofthe esoteric arts and his physician, Johann Schweitzer, also known as Helvetius, onceclaimed to have performed alchemy and turn lead into gold.William of Orange became William III of England as husband of Queen Mary. It wasWilliam’s grotesque treatment of the Irish which led to centuries of bitterness in Irelandwhich continues to this day. In 1694, William signed the charter for the Bank of Englandand the Black Nobility, together with the reptile-Aryan aristocracy already well establishedin Britain, made the City of London-New Troy the centre of global finance, a position itstill enjoys. Little wonder that the entrance to the City of London financial centre ismarked by statues of winged reptiles holding the red cross on a white shield, the ancientAryan Sun symbol, and also the symbol of the Rosi Crucis or Sumerian Gra-al, thereptilian bloodlines (more about that later). Other central banks had already been createdby the reptile-Aryan Black Nobility branches. They were the Bank of Amsterdam (1609),Bank of Hamburg (1619) and the Bank of Sweden (1661), but the Bank of England wasthe jewel. They were designed to lend those governments money that did not exist andcharge them (the people through taxation) interest on the debt. The greater the debt thegreater the interest and therefore the greater the taxation. Get the idea? We’ve been had,my darlin’s, and it’s time to wake up. Governments, of course, could create their ownmoney interest free and have no interest to pay to the private banking cartel. The reasonthey don’t introduce this most obvious system is because the governments are controlledby those who control the banks - the Babylonian Brotherhood. And they coordinatebetween their branches in the various countries to ensure that anyone who sought to do thiswould be immediately crushed economically and politically. The main coordinating bodybetween the interconnected central banks is called the Bank of International Settlements,based in the Brotherhood stronghold of Geneva, Switzerland. Just as the reptileBrotherhood control the monarchies because they are the monarchies, so they have createdand controlled all the political parties, left, right and centre. The ‘radical’ Liberal Party inBritain, now the Liberal Democrats, used to be known as the Venetian Party and at theirhighest levels they are all the reptile-Aryan Party under different guises. Ever wonderedwhy politicians appear to differ so much in public and yet introduce the same policieswhen they get into government? It’s all a conjuring trick on the human mind.The list of people who arranged for William of Orange to take the British thronereads like a Who’s Who? of the reptile-Aryan-Phoenician Elite. Among the long list ofthe Phoenician, sorry, British, aristocracy who subscribed to the Bank of England at itsformation (making unbelievable profits) was William Cavendish, the Duke ofDevonshire, who also signed the invitation for William to become King. TheCavendish’s are based at Chatsworth House in Derbyshire, now a tourist attraction, andI felt it to be one of the blackest places I have ever visited. As with all these statelyhomes of the Brotherhood, goodness knows what has gone on there over the centuries."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"127The Cavendish family crest is a reptile and a snake, whatever its origin it is highlyappropriate. The Cavendish’s fused with the Kennedy family of the United States whenKathleen, the sister of President John E Kennedy, married the heir to the Devonshirefortune. When he died during World War II and she had claim to the Devonshire estates,she ‘conveniently’ died in a plane crash. The Kennedy’s are another Elite bloodlinewhich go back to the ancient Irish kings and beyond. The arrival of William of Orangewas also supported by the reptile-Aryan aristocracy of Scotland where many of thebloodlines based themselves. The Phoenicians were in Scotland thousands of years BC,but some of the most famous ‘Scottish’ bloodlines came later from northern France andBelgium during the reigns of the Scottish kings, David I and Malcolm IV between 1124and 1165. Classic ‘Scottish’ names like Stewart, Seton, Hamilton, Campbell, Douglas,Montgomery, Balliol, Graham, Lindsay, Cameron and Comyn, arrived in this period.These ‘Flemish’ people were bloodlines from Sumer, Babylon, Asia Minor and theCaucasus, who had made their way across land to Europe. Within 150 years of theirarrival in Scotland they were running the show. One of the most famous of Scottishkings, Robert the Bruce, came from the line of Robert of Bruges in what is nowBelgium, one of the key Brotherhood centres today. The battles between the Scots andthe English were, although the people never knew, merely battles between differentbranches of the same Elite for supremacy in the Agenda. Some were reptile-Aryans,some were not. Bruce and the St Clairs/Sinclairs were reptilian for sure. It was one ofBruce’s descendants, the Scottish nobleman James Bruce of Kinnaird, who left Britainin 1768 for Abyssinia, now Ethiopia, to find a rare copy of the Kebra Nagast, the sacredbook of the Ethiopians, and three copies of the Book of Enoch with which he returnedto Europe in 1773. James Bruce was a Freemason, a member of the CanongateKilwinning No 2 Lodge in Edinburgh, one of the oldest in Scotland.1 The presentBritish royal family, the Windsors, carry some of the blood of Robert the Bruce and ofthe Scottish, Irish and Welsh Elite, as well as the genetic stream of the reptile-Aryanbranches in Germany. The Windsors, like all the royal families (family) of Europe arerepresentatives of the Black Nobility and Babylonian Brotherhood and related toWilliam of Orange. They are, as I shall be describing, shape-shifting reptilians.Anna Campbell, Countess of Balcarras and Argyll, was governess to the youngPrince William, and Archibald Campbell, first Duke of Argyll, was alongside him whenhe sailed to England in 1688 to remove the sitting monarch, James II. A descendant ofAnna Campbell was Jenny von Westphalen, who was related to both the Campbells andthe Dukes of Argyll. Jenny von Westphalen was the wife of... Karl Marx, theBrotherhood clone who was used to create Communism. This was one of the greatvehicles used to divide and rule the global population through fear. Incidentally thereason Marx condemned Jews was because, contrary to popular belief, he wasn’t one.He was of a Brotherhood bloodline which is why he got the job as frontman forMarxism, a creed compiled not by him but for him (see .And The Truth Shall Set YouFree). These interconnecting bloodlines have been interbreeding and filling thepositions of political and economic power throughout the centuries and the genealogy is"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"128recorded in the most minute detail. It is known which lines are more open to possessionby the reptilians and which are not. When a position is to be filled, someone is selectedfrom a reptile-Aryan line and if he or she has not already been ‘plugged in’ to thereptilian consciousness via secret society initiations, he or she is invited to join the cluband away they go.The interconnections and breeding of these bloodlines is simply endless. Themodern Earls of Balcarras are related to Viscount Cowdray (Weetman John ChurchillPearson of the London Financial Times family). His mother was the daughter of LordSpencer Churchill, the grandfather of Winston Churchill, and his sister married theScottish Duke of Atholl. The Argyll-Balcarras lines manifest as the Lindsays andCampbells. Robert A. Lindsay, the 12th Earlof Balcarras, became chairman of theNational Westminster Bank, one of fourmajor British clearing banks, and director ofthe Rothschild’s Sun Alliance Assurance.This same Earl was also a British Minister ofState for Defence and for Foreign andCommonwealth Affairs. His mother was aCavendish, who are the Dukes ofDevonshire, headquartered at ChatsworthHouse. And that’s just one tiny example ofthe way the bloodlines interconnect.The Marlborough family, one of the mostpowerful British aristocratic families, alsoplayed an important role in putting Williamof Orange on the British throne. They arerelated to the Churchills and WinstonChurchill was born at their ancestral home,Blenheim Palace near Oxford, where thegates are emblazoned with the Marlboroughfamily crest, dominated by two reptiles (seeFigure 19). Churchill knew exactly what hewas doing when he was the wartime Prime Minister in Britain. The image of him left tous by official history is a farce. He did not save the British Isles from tyranny, he waspart of the tyranny to create a war in which all sides were fronted and funded by thesame people. See .. And The Truth Shall Set You Free for proof of this. I could sit hereall day detailing the Elite reptile-Aryan families and the way they have interbred andinterconnected to hold the reins of power in all areas of human life over thousands ofyears. This world has been controlled since antiquity by the same tribe with theirmasters operating from the lower fourth dimension.The reptile Agenda has been unfolding over many centuries. It is the long term planfor this tribe, and therefore the reptilians, to take over the planet completely. The agendaFigure 19: The Dragon crest of the Marlboroughfamily at Blenheim Palace."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"129has a set timescale and a definite sequence. This is clear by the way each move followsanother with breathtaking efficiency under the supervision of the inner core whichoperates outside the public arena and, ultimately, from another dimension. For example,in 1665 war broke out between the Dutch and the British and the Great Plague killed68,000 Londoners and caused two thirds of the people to leave the city. In 1666, onSeptember 2nd, the Great Fire of London destroyed the city and was blamed, forhistorical purposes, on a baker in Pudding Lane. This happened while the plans werebeing arranged for William of Orange to become King of England. When he arrivedfrom Holland to take the throne, many branches of the Brotherhood bloodlines united inLondon or New Troy to create their operational headquarters. London, thanks to thefire, had created a blank sheet of land on which they could build their new financialcentre. And who was the main architect of the new London? A high initiate of theBrotherhood network called Sir Christopher Wren. All a coincidence? Replicas of StPaul’s Cathedral with its massive dome, an ancient ritual symbol for the Brotherhood,stand in Paris and Washington DC. One is called the Pantheon and the other is theCongress Building on Capitol Hill (named after Capitoline Hill, a sacred hill of theBabylonian Brotherhood in ancient Rome). In the years that followed the arrival ofWilliam of Orange, came the so-called Great British Empire. As a kid I alwayswondered how a few islands which you can hardly see on the globe could have anempire that spanned the world. Now the reason is obvious. It was not the Great BritishEmpire at all. It was the empire of the Babylonian Brotherhood which had based itselfin Britain, and particularly London. As the ‘British’ Empire expanded into theAmericas, Africa, Asia, China, Australia and New Zealand, the BabylonianBrotherhood’s control of the world expanded also. Other reptile-Aryan branches incountries like Spain, Portugal, France, Belgium and Germany, occupied other parts ofAfrica; and the Spanish and Portuguese took care of Central and South America. KingLeopold II of Belgium, a member of the Windsor reptilian bloodline called Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, played a major role in the European occupation and exploitation ofAfrica. Everywhere the reptile-Aryans went they sought to destroy the native cultureand knowledge. They took out of general circulation the esoteric knowledge, memoriesand understanding of true history. Ancient accounts of the reptilians and the origins ofthe white race were largely destroyed or withdrawn to secret Brotherhood libraries, notleast beneath the Vatican. Christianity was used as the vehicle for eliminatinginformation that we vitally need to know.It would seem that the contraction of these British and European empires,particularly in this century, indicates that this control has diminished. Not so. It hasincreased. Overt control, such as a dictatorship you can see, always has a finite life,because in the end there will be a challenge and rebellion against it. Covert control,however, control you cannot see, identify or target, can go on forever, because youdon’t rebel against something you don’t know exists. A person who thinks he is freewill not complain that he is not. So what has happened throughout Africa, SouthAmerica, Asia and the United States and Canada, is that overt control from Britain and"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"130Europe has been replaced by covert control. As these overt empires, particularly theBritish, have appeared on the surface to contract, they have left in these countries thesecret society network, bloodlines and structures to rule just as powerfully as before,but now with no danger of a challenge from people with no idea of who is really incontrol. The global structure is quite simple. The central Agenda is coordinated from theCity of London, which comprises the financial centre known as the ‘Square Mile’, andthe land along the River Thames running down to the headquarters of the British legalprofession, the Houses of Parliament, the centres of government and BritishIntelligence, and across to Buckingham Palace, the home of the reptilian bloodlineknown as the Windsors. The British Government is merely a front for the real Agendathat is operated from these few miles of prime real estate in the City of London and theCity of Westminster. Paris is another key centre for the Babylonian Brotherhood and sois the Vatican. Look at the structures of government known laughingly as ‘democracy’,the structure of law, economics, the media and all the institutions you find in mostcountries today. Where did the original blueprints for these structures come from?London, exactly. We still talk of Britain as the ‘Mother of Parliaments’, for instance.These structures were designed to give the appearance of freedom while allowingalmost limitless control by the few behind the scenes. These are the very structures thatthe British Empire left behind when it apparently withdrew to allow those countries togovern themselves. Like hell they did. Physical occupation was replaced by financialoccupation and overt control by covert control.From London, the reptile-Aryan Elite dictates its policy and Agenda to its ‘branchmanagers’, the bloodline families in each country, which ensure that the Londoncoordinated Agenda is introduced globally. This is why the same policies are beingimposed in every country I visit. In the United States, the main branch managers forLondon are the Rockefellers who have orchestrated a cartel of families and frontmenlike the Morgans, Harrimans, Carnegies, Mellons etc, under the over all supervision ofLondon. In South Africa the bloodline branch managers are the Oppenheimers. I spentthree weeks travelling, talking and listening all over South Africa in 1998 and it is awonderful example of what I am saying here. Look at the history for a start. First theDutch settled the Cape when the Black Nobility were centred in Amsterdam. Then, afterthey moved across the English Channel to London, the British were used as the pawnsof occupation. The Dutch East India Company in South Africa was pushed aside by theBritish East India Company. Explorers of the African interior, like Doctor DavidLivingstone, were funded by organisations such as the National Geographical Society,controlled from the City of London. Another wave of reptile-Aryan-British occupationwas headed by Cecil Rhodes and his South African Company, also a City of Londonoperation. Rhodes was a major Brotherhood frontman, especially through a secretsociety called the Round Table which still exists today and is exposed at length in .. AndThe Truth Shall Set You Free. Rhodes and his South Africa Company started thediamond and gold mining empires called De Beers and Consolidated Goldfields whichthe Oppenheimers now control on behalf of the same Brotherhood that funded Rhodes."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"131Another offshoot of the South Africa Company was the notorious London-RhodesiaCompany called Lonrho, headed most famously by the late Tiny Rowland. Lonrho hasmanipulated and exploited Africa and its people appallingly, which is in line with thepresent day Agenda. Quite clearly, the same group have controlled the African continentunder different companies, people and guises, from the time the first white settlersarrived.Before the transfer of power from white minority to black majority under NelsonMandela in South Africa, the Oppenheimer family controlled something like 80 per centof the companies quoted on the South African stock-market and they owned the gold,diamond and other mining industries on which the country depends. They also controlledthe media through various frontmen. Then came ‘massive change’ as Nelson Mandelawas released and the blacks were given their ‘freedom’. Now, after this blow f9rdemocracy, the Oppenheimers still control something like 80 per cent of the companieson the South African stock-market, they own the gold, diamond and other miningindustries on which the country depends, and they control the media via frontmen likeHenry Kissinger’s friend, Tony O’Reilly, the Irish billionaire. O’Reilly resigned aschairman of the Brotherhood-controlled Heinz corporation and began to buy upnewspapers all over the world, money apparently no object. So what’s the differencebetween the Brotherhood’s control of South Africa before and after the ‘changeover’?One thing and one thing only: no-one is complaining anymore because overt control hasbeen replaced by covert control. When there was a white minority dictatorship the globalcondemnation could be heard constantly: “It’s not fair”, the robot radicals would scream,“It’s racism, it’s dictatorship. Outrageous.” And it was. But now the rallies and theprotests have stopped and Mandela is a hero to the world while the same people go oncontrolling South Africa as they did before, although now without a word of protest fromthe heart-on-the-sleeve, wave-your-banner merchants. The shanty towns and corrugatediron ghettos are still there in Soweto and in even more places these days, but they are noton the daily news anymore because everyone knows that South Africa is now free. TheANC government is just as controlled and corrupt as the white one it replaced. Shell Oil,the Babylonian Brotherhood oil company controlled by people like Prince Bernhard ofthe Netherlands, gave a whole tower block to the ANC at the time of the changeover, andit is, apparently, common knowledge among journalists worth the name, that Mandelatakes no major decision without consulting the Oppenheimers. In 1993, Mandela spentChristmas at the Nassau holiday home of Tony O’Reilly. In early 1994, O’Reilly boughtSouth Africa’s biggest newspaper group. Oops, could I be questioning a global hero?Slap my wrist. In fact, Mandela is probably quite a genuine guy who has simply learnedthe realities of where the real power lies and he can’t summon the strength or desire toopenly challenge the system anymore. But there are many truly corrupt blacks, likeRobert Mugabe, the President of Zimbabwe, who are only too willing to take the moneyand play the frontman for the Babylonian Brotherhood at the grotesque expense of thepeople. Only in this way can overt control operate behind black faces and there arereptilian bloodlines among the blacks as well as the whites."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"132The same situation exists throughout the world where you find the same bloodlinesand their puppets in charge in country after country, in front of the camera and behindthe scenes. The latter group hold the real power, of course. So if it suits the Agenda tocrash the US dollar or the Mexican Peso or bring down a government, or start a civilwar, the branch managers in those countries go to work through their financial, mediaand secret society operations to ensure that it happens. In this way, the world can be runby a very few people in the City of London and other Brotherhood centres like Paris,Bonn, Brussels, Washington, New York, Switzerland and the Vatican. It’s a simple andbrilliantly organised structure, ruled from the top with a rod of iron, and no mercy isshown to anyone who does not do exactly as they are told. That’s why it has worked soefficiently for so long. Add to that the fact that the truth of what is going on is so bizarrethat most people will not believe it and you have the perfect situation for ongoing,unchallenged control.Until now.SOURCES1From The Ashes Of Angels, p 12."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"133CHAPTER SEVENKnights of the SunOver thousands of years, the reptilian full-bloods and crossbreeds have created afantastic web of interconnecting secret societies to enforce their Agenda. Yet the peoplein general have been unaware that such a coordinating force has been at work,manipulating their governments and their lives. In the next three chapters I will showhow these networks seized control of the institutions of royal, political and religiouspower, and created the United States. This apparent ‘superpower’ is still a puppet of theBabylonian Brotherhood in London.Three of the most significant of the secret societies emerged publicly in the 12thcentury. They are still in existence today and have among their membership top peoplein global politics, banking, business, military and the media. They were the KnightsTemplar, the Knights Hospitaller of St John of Jerusalem and the Teutonic Knights. TheKnights Hospitaller have changed their name a number of times. They have been theKnights of Rhodes and today they are the Knights of Malta in their ‘Roman Catholic’form and their ‘Protestant’ version is known as the Knights of St John of Jerusalem. Asthe Knights of Malta, their official head is the Pope and their headquarters is in Rome.As the Knights of St John they are based in London and their official head is the Kingor Queen. The Catholic and Protestant wings are in fact the same organisation at thehighest level. The Knights Templar were formed about the same time in 1118, thoughthis could have been at least four years earlier, and were first known as the Soldiers ofChrist. The Templars are surrounded in mystery and contradiction, but it is known thatthey dedicated the order to the ‘Mother of God’. The Knights Templar promoted aChristian image as a cover and so Mother of God was taken to be Mary, the mother ofJesus, but to the reptile-Aryan secret societies the term, Mother of God, is symbolic ofIsis, the virgin mother of the Egyptian Son of God, Horus, and the wife of the Sun god,Osiris, in Egyptian legend. Isis, in turn, is another name for Queen Semiramis, as inNimrod-Semiramis-Tammuz. Isis/Semiramis is also known by a stream of other namesin the various regions, cultures and countries. These include Barati, Diana, Rhea,Minerva, Aphrodite, Venus, Hecate, Juno, Ceres, Luna and many, many others. It is saidthat they are symbolic of the Moon, the female energy in its various forms. Theheadquarters of the Grand Mother Lodge of English Freemasonry (Grand Mother =Semiramis/Isis) is based in Great Queen Street in London (Great Queen = Semiramis/Isis). In the end all the names were inspired by Ninkharsag, the Anunnaki ‘MotherGoddess’ of the reptilian-human crossbreeds, their ‘mammy’. The ancient gods such as"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"134Nimrod/Osiris and the endless other names under which he is known, represent thepower of the Sun, the male. This was the knowledge on which the Templars werefounded and their Phoenician and reptilian inspiration can be seen in their symbol, thered cross on a white background - the fire cross or Sun symbol of the Phoenicians andsymbol of the bloodlines. This is also the flag of England to this day.From the start of the official Templar story there were blatant untruths. Theyclaimed to have been formed to protect pilgrims in the Holy Land, but for the firstnine years it seems there were only nine of them. Some protection. It doesn’t take agenius to see that this was a smokescreen for something else. In fact, it would appearthey were formed as the protectors and military wing of a secret society called theOrder of Sion, later the Priory of Sion. The word ‘Sion’ comes from Siona, theancient Sanskrit (Aryan) name for... the Sun.1 Here we go again. Among the laterGrand Masters of the Priory of Sion, according to the book, Holy Blood, Holy Grail,2was Leonardo da Vinci, who was sponsored by the de Medici banking family of theVenetian Black Nobility. They would also sponsor Christopher Columbus. Among themost important sponsors and supporters of the early Templars was St Bernard, thefounder of the Cistercian Order, and the French St Clair family which became theScottish Sinclair family after they settled in Scotland following the Norman invasionof Britain by William the Conqueror in 1066. The St Clair/Sinclairs are of a reptilianbloodline and knowledge of the reptilian Agenda was the great secret held by theleading Templars. The first Grand Master of the Knights Templar was Hughes dePayens, who joined in 1124. He was a French nobleman (meaning literally: Aryan-man) allied to the Count of Champagne, and was married to a Scottish woman ofNorman decent called Catherine St Clair. The first Templar centre or ‘preceptory’outside the Holy Land was built on the St Clair estate in Scotland. Other earlyTemplars included Fulk, the Count d’Anjou, who was the father of GeoffreyPlantagenet and the grandfather of the English King, Henry II. It was Henry whosponsored the building of the famous Benedictine Abbey at Glastonbury in the westof England, a sacred site since ancient times. The Templars were connected to theKnights Hospitaller (Knights of Malta) at their highest level and these links verymuch continue today. There are many tales of how much they hated each other andthere have undoubtedly been periods of rifts and conflict. But at their peak they aredifferent branches of the same organisation and at that level the Agenda is allimportant. In June 1099, another glorious blow was struck for the ‘Lord’ whenChristian crusaders invaded Jerusalem and slaughtered the Saracen Muslim Turks andthe Judeans living there. This reopened the ‘Holy City’ to Christian pilgrims whobegan to arrive in large numbers through the ports of Jaffa, Tyre and Acre. Tyre wasone of the major centres for the Phoenicians. The Knights Hospitaller established theAmalfi Hostelry in Jerusalem to provide food and shelter for the visitors. As theirwealth and prestige grew, they formed a military wing, which was given papalbacking in 1118, the same year that the original nine Knights Templar arrived inJerusalem to ‘guard’ the pilgrims."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"135The Templars were given quarters adjoining Temple Mount, the alleged, and I stressalleged, site of Solomon’s Temple. Some researchers believe the Templars foundsomething of great value, possibly manuscripts, possibly vast amounts of gold, whileexcavating under Temple Mount. But whatever happened events began to move rapidlyafter 1126, for it was then that the Grand Master, Hugues de Payens, left Jerusalem togather recruits and expand the order. He headed back to France to meet St Bernard, thenAbbot of Clairvaux, and he took with him Bernard’s Templar uncle, Andre deMontbard. Bernard sang their praises to Pope Honarius II, and the Templars wereformally established on January 31st 1128 at the Council of Troyes. Yes, named afterTroy, that great Aryan and reptile-Aryan headquarters in Asia Minor which also inspiredthe original name of London. The Templars were part of the same gang, although manyof the lower initiates would not have known this. Among their symbols, apart from thePhoenician red cross, were a black and white flag (made up of two squares), the skulland crossbones, and the watchtower. All of these symbols have spanned the centuries tothe present day Brotherhood organisations. The black and white squares can be foundon the floor of every Freemason Temple, because the Freemasons are the Templarsunder another name. Many churches and cathedrals, like Westminster Abbey and NotreDame in Paris, also have black and white squares on the floor, because the Christianchurch is a front for the Babylonian Brotherhood. Many police forces, including thosein the UK and the USA, have black and white squares on their uniform because they arecontrolled by the Freemasons and the Templars. The skull and bones is symbolic, inpart, of the black magic rituals the Brotherhood have employed since their very earliestdays and these same sickening rituals, often involving human sacrifice, are still goingon today. If you look at the Vatican or papal crest, you will see that the dome of StPeter’s Basilica and the crossed keys of Peter also form the same skull and crossbones.They’re all in it together. This theme could well be the reason that the Piso family in theGospel stories said the location of the ‘crucifixion’ of Jesus, was a place calledGolgotha, meaning: the place of the skull. Another Babylonian Brotherhoodorganisation is the appropriately named Skull and Bones Society based across the roadfrom the campus of Yale University at New Haven in Connecticut, USA. It is a blooddrinking, Satanic secret society for the bloodline families and its most famous currentmember is George Bush, the former President of the United States and a shape-shiftingreptilian. He is also one of the foremost drug runners in America, and a Satanist, childabuser and serial killer. See a later chapter for details of this. The Watchtower symbolcan be seen in the Jehovah’s Witness organisation because this is also a Brotherhoodfront that is conning countless followers into believing it is Christian. One of itsfounders was Charles Taze Russell, a high degree Freemason, who is buried under apyramid.Only a year after the Templars were formally established at the Council of Troyes,incredible expansion had taken place. They had a papal constitution, wealth, land and threehundred recruits from noble families who had to give all their wealth to the Templars whenthey joined. As a result they owned land in France, England, Scotland, Spain and Portugal,"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"136and within ten years this was extended to Italy, Austria, Germany, Hungary andConstantinople. There were Templar preceptories and villages, hamlets and farmsgalore all over England. Whenever you see the name Temple in a British place name(for instance Templecombe) it is a former Templar site. Their national headquarters wasin London on land which is now High Holborn and in 1161 they moved a short distanceto a new London temple which is still today called Temple Bar. Here can be found theoriginal church in the classic round design of the Templars, along with some Templargraves. In a most prominent position in Temple Bar, in the centre of the mainthoroughfare, is a statue of a winged reptile. The Templar holdings included the Strandand much of Fleet Street which, until recently, was the home of the British nationalnewspaper industry. The symbol of the national tabloid, The Daily Express, onceheadquartered in Fleet Street, is a knight carrying a shield emblazoned with theTemplar-Phoenician red cross on a white background. The Templar lands stretcheddown to the River Thames where the Templars had their own docks. During the reign ofQueen Victoria, the Brotherhood erected an obelisk alongside the Thames at this pointand placed a sphinx on either side. The obelisk had formerly stood in the Egyptian cityof On or Heliopolis (the City or Place of the Sun) and it is known today as Cleopatra’sNeedle (see picture section). This obelisk is an ancient Egyptian-Aryan symbol of theSun, the male energy, the phallus. These symbols are to be found in many places, oftenunder the guise of war memorials and have been placed there by Freemasonicmanipulation. Has anyone ever asked themselves why a war memorial nearly alwayshas to be an obelisk? And why do you think the Washington monument in the centre ofWashington DC is a giant obelisk? Because obelisks, like all these symbols andgeometrical shapes, generate the energy they represent. I remember climbing somestone steps inside a big obelisk near Hebden Bridge in England and feeling enormousmale sexual energy all around me. I wondered what on Earth was happening until Iremembered where I was... inside a male penis in effect. What a symbol is built torepresent is the energy it will generate, because symbols are a physical manifestation ofthe thoughts which create them. These guys don’t put their symbols everywhere just forfun. They do it because it helps to resonate the energy field to the vibrational frequencythey want. In turn, this affects the thoughts and feelings of the people.Most notably today, the Templar lands of London are the home of the British legalprofession. Barristers qualify when they ‘come to the Bar’ - Temple Bar - and they joineither the Inner Temple, Middle Temple or Outer Temple. I have spoken with people whohave had experience of these organisations and they found them to be very sinister indeed.For sure, they are. If you want to control the people you have to control the law and who isand isn’t prosecuted. Thus you have the police awash with members of the Freemasonsalong with the legal profession and the judges. These Templar lands of all those centuriesago are in the heart of that area of London from the City of London ‘square mile’ financialdistrict down to the Houses of Parliament and Buckingham Palace. This is the land fromwhich the world is currently controlled, at least at the operational level, together with Parisand the Vatican. And Paris was the other dual-headquarters for the Knights Templar. That"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"137city also has a 3,200 year old Egyptian obelisk at a key point in its street plan, the Placede la Concorde. Princess Diana passed that obelisk in the Mercedes literally a minutebefore it crashed in the Pont de L’Alma tunnel in 1997.By the middle of the 12th century the Templars were second only to the RomanChurch for wealth and influence. They had their own fleet of ships (on which they flewthe skull and bones flag), and their financial centres in London and Paris were, in effect,the start of the modern banking system which has made humanity slaves to non-existent‘money’. They, too, lent ‘money’ that didn’t exist and charged interest on it in trueBabylonian Brotherhood style. One documented case shows the Templars charging 60 percent interest on the late payment of a debt. One of the plans promoted by the Templarswas the creation of a United States of Europe and under different guises and fronts theirmasters in the Brotherhood have achieved just that. The creation of the European Unionwith its single central bank and currency is one of the pillars of the Brotherhood Agenda.Some of the advanced knowledge inherited by the Templars was that of the Earth’senergy grid, the network of magnetic force lines known as ley lines, dragon lines ormeridians. The major sacred sites are where many of these lines cross, creatingenormous vortices of energy. If you perform a black magic ritual and human sacrifice atthese points the deeply negative energy it produces is carried on the force linesemanating from the vortex and pumped throughout the network. This affects thevibrational state of the Earth’s magnetic energy field within which we all live. If thatenergy field is full of fear, people will be more likely to feel that emotion. And fear isthe four letter word that controls the world. The most important weapon for theBabylonian Brotherhood since its creation has been the manipulation of fear. Nothinglimits people’s potential to express their true selves more than fear. It becomesunderstandable, therefore, why so many Christian churches were built on ancient Pagansites and why so many Satanic rituals are performed in churches under the cover ofdarkness. It was the Templars, with their knowledge of the esoteric arts, who financedthe great Gothic cathedrals of Europe between 1130 and 1250. The Gothic style can beshown to have originated with the Aryan race in the Middle-Near East. The Gothiccathedrals which were funded and designed by the Templars included WestminsterAbbey, York Minster in northern England, Chartres in France not far from Paris, andNotre Dame in Paris itself. Notre Dame (Our Lady: Isis/Semiramis/Ninkharsag) wasbuilt on a site dedicated to the goddess Diana, and Chartres was placed on an ancientsacred site which once attracted Druids from all over Europe. The famous chapel ofKings College, Cambridge which was based upon the cabalistic Tree of Life symbol,was described as one of the last great Gothic structures built in Britain.3 Its design wasapparently inspired by the 14th century cathedral at Albi in the Languedoc in southernFrance, one of the primary centres for both the Templars and the Cathars. In the 12thand 13th centuries the Cathar religion, which challenged many beliefs of the RomanChurch and contained much esoteric knowledge, was the dominant faith in much ofsouthern France. This sent the alarm bells ringing in the Babylonian Brotherhood inRome and the puppet Pope, Innocent III, destroyed the Cathars in an unspeakable"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"138‘crusade’ of torture and burning, which culminated in the siege of the Cathar castle atMontsegur in 1244. Incidentally, the use of reptile figures called gargoyles becamewidespread on ‘Christian’ churches and cathedrals. Notre Dame in Paris is covered inthem (see picture section) and many are smaller representations of the same reptiledepictions you find on and around the Mayan pyramids and sites in Mexico. TheMexican President, Miguel De La Madrid, said that the Maya had been interbred withthe ‘Iguana race’ - reptilians.Both Chartres and Notre Dame were centres of Black Madonna worship, anotherTemplar obsession. The Black Madonna cult was not related to Mary, mother of Jesus,although that was the impression they wanted people to have. It was the worship ofQueen Semiramis and Isis/Barati. The Egyptians portrayed Isis in white in her positivemode and in black in her negative form. The Black Madonna was the Black Isis/Baratiand more directly, Queen Semiramis who was known in Babylon as the Madonna. TheBlack Madonna symbolises the negative use of female ‘Moon’ energy, while the BlackSun symbolises the negative use of solar energy, the male, besides being an occult namefor the galactic Sun which this solar system orbits over 26,000 years. For instance, thewhite horse was a Sun symbol of the Phoenicians and so the black horse under theBrotherhood’s system of reverse symbolism, represents the malevolent use of the Sunenergy. The black horse is the symbol of the Brotherhood front in the United Kingdom,Lloyds Bank. The statues of Mary holding the baby Jesus in the Christian churches aremirrors of the way the Egyptians portrayed Isis holding the baby, Horus. St Bernard wasclearly a covert disciple of the goddess religion and was born at Fontaines near Dijon, acentre for Black Madonna worship. The Templars shared his passion and they built theirown churches in a circular shape, indicating the feminine. The widespread use of thedome or ‘womb’ by the Brotherhood also relates to this, among other things.The New Age belief system has often fallen into the trap of believing that femaleenergy is good and male energy not so good, because they think the world is male-dominated. In fact the world is dominated by the extremes of both energies, male andfemale. I am not talking about male and female bodies here, but male and female energywhich both men and women have the potential to manifest. When a male suppresses hisfemale polarity he becomes ‘macho man’ and thinks the only way to be a ‘real man’ isto be dominant and aggressive. This extreme of male energy is reflected by soldierswith guns and overt, in your face, aggression and power. Thus we think the world ismale-dominated because you can see the extremes of male energy on the news everynight. That’s the point, you can see it. The negative extreme of female energy, however,is behind the scenes manipulation, covertly setting up the events and conflicts which theextreme of the male energy can play out in public. In other words, you can’t see it. Thisis the energy that the agents of the Babylonian Brotherhood work with and theysymbolise this with names like Semiramis, Isis and all the rest. They also know that thefemale energy is the creative force, which brought forth even the Sun, as the Egyptiansused to say of Isis. This female force, like all energy, is neutral. You can createsomething positive or something malevolent, but to do either you need to harness the"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"139female, the creative force. Hence you have the constant female symbolism by theBrotherhood in all its forms. It is the balanced, positive expression of the female energythat they have sought to suppress, not the female energy itself.The Gothic cathedrals and Christian churches are full of Sun, astrological, goddessand sexual symbolism. The great Gothic doorways and the ridges around them aredepictions of the vulva and many even have a clitoris symbol at the top of the arch. Thesame is depicted in windows and especially the rose windows of the Gothic cathedralswhich face west, the sacred direction of female deities. Carvings on other medievalchurches have been found which portray monks and priests having sex with young girlsand wearing animal heads. This is what the Satanists still do today. The Sheela-na-gigsymbols in old churches, particularly prevalent in Ireland, represent naked women withspread legs and inside the alters of churches have been found stone phallic symbols. Mygoodness, what will the vicar think? The often shell-like receptacle for the ‘holy water’is goddess symbolism also, and churches were actually built as a symbolic womb. Thespider’s web and maze decorations of the Gothic and other cathedrals and churchesrefer to the female ‘goddess’ energy, the intuitive, creative force, which weaves andspins the fate of the world. This is also the symbolism of the Spider Woman legends ofthe Native American traditions and the names of sacred places like Spider Rock inArizona. A book by Fred Gettings, The Secret Zodiac (Routledge and Kegan Paul,1987), features the zodiac mosaic in the marble floor of the Gothic church of SanMiniato in Florence, Italy, which dates from 1207. Gettings suggests that the churchwas built to align with a rare conjunction of Mercury, Venus and Saturn in the sign ofTaurus at the end of May that year. Astrology, which can be traced back to thebeginning of known history, was a very important art to the Templars and was taught inthe school at Chartres. When Christians go to church they have no idea that they areentering a ‘Pagan’ shrine, but that’s exactly what they are doing.The Templars had close relationships with most of the monarchs of the time,although less so in France. Given their immense wealth, the Templars ‘owned’ many ofthe kings who appeared to be in power, just as their Brotherhood successors own thegovernments of today. The Templars were close to Henry II of England, the sponsor ofGlastonbury. How interesting that Henry’s famous feud with the Archbishop ofCanterbury, Thomas a Becket, ended when two knights arrived from France to murderhim in Canterbury Cathedral in 1170. Henry’s son Richard the Lionheart was, in effect,a Templar himself, though not officially. He used their ships and preceptories and whenhe was forced to escape from England and the threats of his brother, John, he did sodisguised as a Templar. He was protected by them and headed for the Holy Landcrusades against the Muslim Saracens. Richard sold Cyprus (a former Phoeniciansettlement) to the Templars and he was involved in negotiations between them and theirIslamic version, the secret society called the Assassins. This word is now used todescribe a killer and it derives from the Assassins particular method of ruling by fearand terrorism. Assassin is said to mean ‘user of hashish’ because they used the drug totrick and manipulate young men into killing for ‘God’ in the belief that this would"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"140secure their place in paradise. The name could also originate from the words hass (todestroy) and asana (to lay snares). They waged an international terrorist war from theirmountain headquarters at Alamut or Eagles Nest in Persia (Asia Minor/Turkey). Potterydecorated with pentagrams and the symbol of the female vulva have been found at thissite and the Assassins wore white tunics with a red sash. The Assassins, who stillcontinue today under different fronts, emerged from a sect founded by a Persian calledHassan Sabah (another very possible origin of the name) in 1090, the same period theTemplars, Knights Hospitaller, and the Teutonic Knights were being formed.The Templars and the Assassins worked together although they appeared to be ondifferent sides. This is the way the public are still duped today into believing thatbecause two groups war or oppose each other in public they must be on different sides.If you want to control the outcome of a game, you have to control both sides, but to getaway with this you must kid the people that the two sides have different masters andgoals. One of the most effective methods of manipulation by the Brotherhood is tocreate or infiltrate all sides and so control the outcome. The Templars were skilled inthis. While they were escorting Richard the Lionheart to the Crusades, they weresupporting his brother and fierce rival, King John. The Templars were behind thesigning of the Magna Carta in 1215, thanks to the efforts of Aymeric de St Maur, theTemplar’s Grand Master in England and King John’s closest advisor. The Magna Cartacurtailed many powers of the monarchy, so increasing the Templars control and leadingfurther down the road to the Agenda’s long term goal to introduce ‘democracy’:imprisonment disguised as freedom. Covert control instead of overt control. I am notsaying that all the Templars were of negative intent. I’m sure that’s not the case. But asalways in these secret societies there were many levels of knowledge and agendas. TheFrench writer and researcher, Jean Robin, concluded that the Order of the Templeconsisted of seven outer circles which were taught the ‘minor’ mysteries and three innercircles which worked with the ‘great’ mysteries. It is the same with Freemasonry and allsecret societies today. The mass of the membership has no idea what their top levelsknow or the Agenda they are promoting.Despite their wealth, the Templars were exempt from taxes (just like the tax-exempt foundations of the Brotherhood today) and they had their own courts. Theycontrolled monarchs, people of influence, businesses and countries. Their methodwas to manipulate their ‘targets’ into a position of dependency, usually throughblackmail or debt. In this way the Templars could then dictate their actions. Nothingchanges. Edward I borrowed substantial sums from the Templars while King Johnand Henry III were up to their necks in debt to them. At one point, Henry pawned theCrown Jewels to the Templars to pay for military exploits. This is another ancienttechnique of the Babylonian Brotherhood still constantly used today. Manipulatewars, lend all sides the money to fight them, and pick up massive profits from thehorrors you have secretly caused. You also lend the same countries money to rebuildtheir shattered societies and this makes them even more in your debt and furtherunder your control. You can also use the war to remove leaders, take over lands, and"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"141redraw the boundaries in line with your Agenda. Look at the two world wars in the 20thcentury to see how it is done. This is explained in detail in .. .And The Truth Shall SetYou Free. The English Crown Jewels at the time of King John were kept at theTemplar’s London Temple and under John, Henry II, Henry III and Edward I, it wasalso one of four royal treasuries. The Templars collected the taxes for the Pope and theCrown, plus the taxation known as tithes. They were a private organisation with a secretagenda, collecting taxes from the people on behalf of others and a great slice of thatmoney went straight to themselves in payment for interest on loans. Apparently theywere ruthless with non-payers. Today these are still the methods used throughout theworld. The Templar vows of sobriety and chastity were often so much hypocrisy. Onedescription for heavy drinking in medieval England was to ‘drink like a Templar’.When it came to the serious business of money, however, they were as ruthless withtheir own as they were with the populace. It is the same today when members of theBrotherhood and their lackeys step out of line. In France, the Templar centre in Pariswas the leading royal treasury and the French monarchy was also in serious debt tothem. But the French king, Philippe IV, or Philippe the Fair, decided, it seems, that he’dhad enough and took steps to destroy the Templars in a purge against them in October1307. Or at least that’s the official story. There is a great deal more to know before wecan understand what really happened and its relevance to the world events whichfollowed. I will summarise some of the background.The Merovingian bloodlineFrom their creation, the Templars and the Order of Sion, later Priory of Sion, were twobranches of the same organisation. The role of the Priory of Sion, claimed by the bookHoly Blood, Holy Grail, is to protect a ‘royal’ bloodline called the Merovingians, butthere are so many smokescreens in this story to obscure the truth. One of these is theclaim that the Merovingians are the bloodline of Jesus, via the child or children heconceived with Mary Magdalene, who fled with them to the South of France after the‘Crucifixion’. But there was no Jesus and no Mary because these are symbolic figuresin a story which has been told endless times throughout the pre-Christian world, usingdifferent names. I find it hard to comprehend, therefore, how two symbolic peoplecould conceive a bloodline that became the Merovingians. It’s baloney and this talehas been hatched to divert researchers from the truth. Yes, the truth is about bloodlinesand no doubt the Merovingians are a major one. But no, it has nothing whatsoever todo with Jesus. This particular line became known as the Merovingians in France by the5th and 6th centuries. We are indebted for the early history of these people toFredegar’s Chronicle, a copy of which exists in the National Library in Paris. Fredegarwas a 7th century scribe from Burgundy and he worked for 35 years to complete hisrecord of the early Franks and Merovingians. A tribe called the Sicambrian Franks,from whom we get France, was another link in the Aryan and reptile-Aryan ‘vine’. TheFranks were named after their leader, Francio, who died in 11 BC. Francio’s peoplemigrated from Troy in what is now Turkey and became the Scythians and eventually"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"142the Sicambrian Franks, named after their tribal queen, Cambra, in the late fourthcentury. They originated in Scythia, north of the Black Sea in the Caucasus Mountains,from where the Aryan and reptile-Aryan race swept across Europe. The SicambrianFranks called themselves the Newmage - the People of the Covenant; that is thecovenant of the Anunnaki.The Sicambrian Franks later lived in an area west of the River Danube and settled inGermania (named by the Romans after the Scythian ‘genuine ones’) and their centre wasCologne. It was from the time of King Meroveus, who was named Guardian of theFranks in 448, that this line became known as the Merovingians. These were the sorcererkings who were noted for their esoteric knowledge and magical powers which theyinherited from the underground bloodline streams of secret groups and initiations.Francio, the founder of the Franks, claimed to be a descendant of Noah and his ancestorsonce resided in ancient Troy. I think myself that the story of Noah is symbolic of thereptilian crossbreed bloodlines which survived the flood and afterwards returned thedove and the olive branch (Semiramis-Nimrod) to power. Decendents of Noah = human-reptilian crossbreeds, or at least those who have interbred enough to maintain thatgenetic structure. The French city of Troyes, where the Templars were officially formed,was named by the Sicambrian Franks after their former home. The City of Paris wasestablished by them in the 6th century after they became known as the Merovingians andit was named after Prince Paris, the son of King Priam of Troy. It was the relationshipbetween Prince Paris and Helen of Sparta which supposedly caused the Trojan War inwhich the Trojan Horse infiltration assured victory for the Spartans. Both the Trojans andthe Spartans were offshoots of the same Aryan and reptile-Aryan peoples. TheMerovingians established the city of Paris on a major vortex point and used anunderground chamber there for their rituals, including human sacrifice to the goddessDiana. Here, kings in dispute over property would settle the issue in combat. Meroveus,the founder of the Merovingian dynasty, followed the Pagan goddess cult of Diana,another symbol for Isis/Semiramis. This is not surprising because the centre for Dianaworship was at Ephesus in Asia Minor, not far from the alleged site of Troy. The locationof the ancient underground chamber in Paris where the Merovingians worshipped andsacrificed to the goddess Diana is now called the Pont and Place de liAlma and it is still,by design, an underground chamber. On the site today is a road tunnel and it was herethat the car of Diana, Princess of Wales, crashed in the early morning of Sunday, August31st 1997. Another offshoot of the Scythian-Sicambrian Franks-Merovingian bloodlineemigrated from northern France and Belgium in the 12th century to become the famous‘Scottish’ families and some of these were the ancestors of Diana, Princess of Wales.The Merovingian king, Clovis, had the iris, or fleur-de-lis, as his royal emblem, aflower which grows wild in the Middle East. It is also known as a three-pronged lilyand it was used to symbolise Nimrod or rather the reptilian bloodline of Nimrod. InLatin it means small sword and it became the symbol of the royal bloodline of what isnow France and this was because in ancient Sumer the reptilian bloodline, as passed onthrough the female, was symbolised by a lily. Hence the main reptilian gene carriers"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"143were given names like Lilith, Lili, Lilutu and Lillette. Another version is Lilibet orElizabeth and this is why the present British Queen is called Elizabeth (El-lizard-birth)and was known to her family circle as Lilibet. She is a major reptilian gene carrier whoproduced a major reptilian full-blood called Prince Charles. Both are shape-shiftingreptilians, a fact that will be supported by later evidence. So is the Queen Mother,formerly Elizabeth (El-lizard-birth) Bowes-Lyon. The fleur-de-lis is an ancient symboland also represents the twin phallic pillars of Jachin and Boaz in the symbolicSolomon’s Temple, which were carved with ‘lilywork’, as described in Kings 7:22.Today you will see the fleur-de-lis used profusely on the regalia of British royalty, onofficial buildings and the fencing around them, and in churches. It is, appropriately, on apublic gate to the White House in Washington, another home of the bloodlines. Thethree-leafed shamrock in Ireland is likewise an ancient symbol of the bloodline and theword shamrock comes from the North African term: shamrukh. All these symbols relateto the three horned depiction of Nimrod in Babylon and to other esoteric principles.Other Merovingian symbols were the fish (Nimrod again), the lion (Leo, the Sun,authority), and the bee. Three hundred golden bees were found on the burial cloak ofKing Childeric I, the son of Meroveus, who died in the 5th century. Bees are an ancientsymbol of the Love Goddess (Semiramis) and symbolised royalty in Egypt. They alsofocus on the Queen Bee, symbolic of Isis/Semiramis.The Merovingians were another name for a Babylonian Brotherhood bloodline andthe idea that they are from the bloodline of Jesus is a play on words, or, rather, a play ondeities, by the Priory of Sion. Jesus is another name for Nimrod/Tammuz, the father-sonof Babylon. Therefore, I would suggest, the bloodline of ‘Jesus ‘is really the bloodlineof the ‘Nimrod’ Brotherhood, the reptile-Aryans. Also, the Priory of Sion say they arededicated to restoring the Merovingian line to the throne of France. They never werethe monarchy of France, because it didn’t exist at that time. It’s all nonsense anddesigned to hide the real Agenda of the Priory of Sion which is a BabylonianBrotherhood front. What all these diversions obscure is a simple and devastating truth.The ‘Grant of Arms’ or symbol of the Dragon bloodine in Sumer was called a Gra-al,also known as the Mark of Cain. The biblical Cain was one of the early Anunnaki-human royal crossbreeds who followed ‘Adam’. It is this Gra-al that became the so-called Holy Grail and this is why its equvilant in Old French means ‘blood royal’. TheGrant of Arms emblem in Sumer was... a cup of waters or a Rosi-Crucis or ‘Dew Cup’.It is described in Egyptian, Sumerian, Phoenician and Hebrew records as a cupdecorated with a red cross within a circle. This is the true origin of the ‘grail cup’. Itwasn’t the cup that caught the blood of Jesus at the crucifixion because there was noJesus or crucifixion. It was the cup that symbolised the womb and the bloodline of themost ‘pure’ of the reptilian crossbreeds which is passed on most crucially through thefemale. The term Rosi-Crucis was also the origin, quite obviously, of the Rosicrucians,an ancient secret society which has schemed and manipulated to ensure the reptilianbloodlines continue to occupy the positions of power. One of the authors who is sellingthe idea that the bloodline relates to Jesus is Sir Laurence Gardner, ‘a sovereign and"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"144chivalric genealogist’. Funny that, because he must know this is not true. Sir Laurenceis Chancellor of the Imperial and Royal Court of the Dragon Sovereignty, the formerRoyal Court of the Dragon in Egypt. He is also Prior of the Celtic Church of the SacredKindred of Saint Columba (Semiramis); Presidential Attache to the European Councilof Princes; formerly attached to the Noble Household Guard of the Royal House ofStewart (Stuart, the Merovingian line); he is known as Le Chevalier Labhran de SaintGermain, and is Preceptor of the Knights Templars of Saint Anthony. I think it’s fair tocall him an insider. So why does he keep telling us the Holy Grail bloodline is aboutJesus when, with that background, he must know that it isn’t?Eventually the Roman Church withdrew its support for the Merovingians and theylost their power and faded from the public scene until the last few years. Anotherbloodline monarch from the reptilian ‘stable’ became King of the Franks. His name wasCharles, better known as Charlemagne, one of the most celebrated monarchs in thehistory of Europe. He was an early patron of the stone masons who later built theGothic cathedrals of Europe for the Templars. In Toulouse he is said to have founded alodge of the Rosicrucian Order, which has its origins at least as far back as ancientEgypt,4 and relates, as stated, to the Rosi-Crusis, the symbol of the reptilian bloodlines.Charlemagne vastly extended the Frankish empire and in 800 he was installed asEmperor of the West in the papal empire of Pope Leo III. The Church of Rome/Babyloncontrolled much of western and central Europe. This domination was completed whenthe military opposition to Rome, the Hohenstaufens or Ghibellines, were defeated bythe Guelphs, named after Welf, the Duke of Bavaria, in 1268. This led to the creation ofthe Holy Roman Empire, an horrendous papal dictatorship. Its most prominent dynastyof Emperors were the Habsburgs, a bloodline family first noted in Switzerland duringthe 10th century. They emerged with papal support to govern the Holy Roman Empirefor five hundred years until its demise in 1806. They ruled Austria from 1278 and in the16th century they inherited the crown of Spain. The Habsburgs are a reptilian bloodlineand I know a high priestess who has officiated at top Satanic rituals and who has seenthe modern Habsburgs at rituals shape-shift into reptilians. A lot more from her later.Charlemagne was a wonderful servant of the Babylonian Brotherhood and his bloodlinehas continued to hold the reins of power. At least 33 American presidents aregenetically related to him.The Rennes-le-Chateau mysteryThe Merovingians returned to public attention more recently in a number of booksseeking to solve the mystery of the tiny mountain top hamlet in the Languedoc insouthern France called Rennes-le-Chateau. This was once one of the most importantcentres for the Priory of Sion, the Templars, the Cathars and many others in the‘knowledge’ stream. The area was once peopled by the Celts, the former Cimmeriansand Scythians, from the Near East and the Caucasus Mountains, and Rennes-le-Chateauwas called Rhedae after one of their tribes. It was worshipped as a sacred place by theDruids because again this is a region of immense magnetic power. In the late 1960s a"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"145document of uncertain background called the Red Serpent or Le Serpent Rouge came tolight in the National Library in Paris. It contained the genealogy of the Merovingians, twomaps of France in the Merovingian period, and a ground plan of St Sulpice, the RomanCatholic centre for occult studies in Paris.5 St Sulpice was built on the ruins of a temple toIsis/Semiramis and was a burial ground for Merovingian kings. Le Serpent Rouge wasdated January 17th 1967, and the deposit slip at the National Library was dated FebruarylSth.6 The latter turned out to be a forgery, however, and the real date it was deposited wasMarch 2Oth.7 By this time all the alleged authors of the work, Pierre Feugere, LouisSaint-Maxent and Gaston de Koker, had died within 24 hours of each other on March6~7.8 But it gets even stranger because these three, it emerges, were not the authors atall.9 Someone, it is thought, had used the names of these three dead men as the authors toadd more mystery to the tale. There were 13 days between the three deaths and the depositof the document at the library. The 13 page document included short prose poemscorresponding to each sign of the zodiac and it listed 13 signs. It called the extra one,Ophiuchus (the Serpent Holder), which it placed between Scorpio and Sagittarius. Themost important number to the Templars was 13 and this will become more and morerelevant as the story unfolds. I have long believed there were originally 13 signs to thezodiac. The text of Le Serpent Rouge, which appears to mention the landscape aroundRennes-le-Chateau, presents a version of the Sleeping Beauty story in which the princess(female energy) is condemned to sleep until the handsome prince arrives to awaken her.This is also highly relevant to the number 13 for reasons I will later outline. Le SerpentRouge also confirmed that Mary Magdalene was another symbol for Isis. It said:..... Formerly some called her ISIS, queen of the beneficent sources, COME TO ME ALLYOU SUFFER AND WHO ARE OVERWHELMED AND I WILL COMFORT YOU, others:MAGDALENE, of the famous vase full of healing balm. The initiates know her true name:NOTRE DAME DES CROSS.”10The female energy and the reptilian bloodline are passed on through the female,and since the intervention of Ninkharsag and Enki this energy was symbolised byMary, Isis and Semiramis, and was also known as Diana. Princess Diana was killed onan ancient Merovingian sacrificial site to the goddess Diana when her car struck the13th pillar. A cave at Sainte-Baume in southern France is an official Catholic shrinebecause, it is said quite wrongly, Mary Magdalene lived there.11 In fact, during Romantimes that cave was a centre for the worship of the goddess Diana Lucifera -Diana thelight bringer or Illuminatrix. This was the very name given to Mary Magdalene byJacobus de Voragine, the Dominican Archbishop of Black Nobility Genoa.12 One otherinteresting point is that while Templars throughout France were arrested and torturedafter the purge by Phillipe the Fair in 1307, the ones in the Rennes-le-Chateau area atLe Bezu, le Valdieu and Blanchefort, were left alone. This area was quite obviouslyvery important to the Templars and they were connected with the Blanchefort family atChateau de Blanchefort, just two miles from Rennes-le-Chateau. Some researchers"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"146believe that the Templars buried much of their gold near Rennes-le-Chateau. Certainly athird of all their European property was once to be found in the Languedoc region. TheRomans, too, thought this area to be sacred and worshipped their Pagan gods here. By the6th century, Rennes-le-Chateau was a thriving town of 30,000 people, the northern capitalof the Visigoth empire which spread south across the Pyrenees into Spain. The Visigothswere a Germanic or Teutonic people, the same as the later Teutonic Knights who emergedat the same time as the Templars. The Visigoths were again the ancestors of theCimmerians and the Scythians, the white peoples from the Caucasus. It was the Visigothswho swept out of central Europe to sack Rome and bring an end to Roman rule.An ancient Visigoth chateau, the Chateau d’Hautpoul, still survives at Rennes-le-Chateau and it has an alchemist’s tower. Alchemy is the transformation of base man/woman into pure spirit, but it has another meaning too, the transformation of basemetals into gold. The theory of this was summed up by the ancient Greek initiate,Aristotle, who said that the basis of the physical world was what he called prime or firstmatter. This, he said, was a non-physical energy which you could not see or touch. Hebelieved that prime matter could manifest as physical form through the four elements ofEarth, Fire, Water and Air. These elements are different from each other, but each isconnected by a common bond of dryness, moisture, heat or cold. Every element has twoof these qualities, one of which dominates. Earth is cold and dry and drynesspredominates. Fire is hot and dry and heat predominates. Water is moist and cold andcold predominates. Air is hot and moist and moistness predominates. The idea is thatone element can be transformed into another through the bond they have in common, egFire becomes air through the common bond of heat. Substances are made from theelements and if you can transform the elements into each other, you must be able totransform the substances the elements are made from. For instance, lead can be changedinto gold. There is, it is believed, a secret powder which is necessary for thistransformation and it has become known as the Philosopher’s Stone. The d’Hautpoulfamily are said to have been holders of such secrets. The document, Le Serpent Rouge,when speaking of the 13th sign of the zodiac, Ophiuchus, says: “the base lead of mywords may contain the purest gold” 13 For five hundred years, Rennes-le-Chateau wasowned by the Count of Razes and became an important centre for the Cathars. Withtheir demise its power waned. A plague and Catalan bandits completed its fall from amajor town to the tiny hamlet it was to become.14 Today it is a place of great beauty andmystery with views across the mountains and valleys. I would definitely file it underparadise if it were not for a very unpleasant feel in the energy there. I experienced afeeling of underlying ‘evil’.The fantastic geometrical patterns in this area connecting mountains, sacred sitesand churches, have been identified in modern times by people like Henry Lincoln, apioneer researcher of the Rennes-le-Chateau mysteries, and David Wood and IanCampbell in their books Genisis and Geneset (see Figure 20). The goddess Isis ismentioned in old records of Rennes-les-Bains, a short distance from Rennes-le-Chateau, and in the last century a statue of Isis was found near the village.15 Wood"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"147and Campbell suggest that Rennes-le-Chateau and Rennes-le-Bains translate as Queenof the House and Queen of the Waters - the names given by the ancient Egyptians totheir goddesses Nephthys and Isis.16 The area around Rennes-le-Chateau is one ofenormous power and importance within the Earth’s energy grid and therefore became afocus from ancient times for those who understood this and knew how to harness theenergy. The modern world awoke to the story of Rennes-le-Chateau with HenryLincoln’s BBC television films and the book, Holy Blood, Holy Grail, written byLincoln with Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh. It was inspired by the story ofBerenger Sauniere, who, in 1855, became priest at the church of St Mary Magdalene atRennes-le-Chateau. Sauniere was born at nearby Montazels. The church was in aterrible state and, the story goes, in 1887 he and two workmen began the immense taskof repairing the worst of the damage to the interior. They lifted a flagstone near the altarand saw an engraving on the underside depicting two men on one horse. This symbolwas the first seal of the Knights Templar. The flagstone became known as the KnightsStone and can be seen in the village museum. When Sauniere realised there might besomething of importance to find, he continued the search alone. The breakthrough camewhen he dismantled the altar and inside one of the pillars he found hollow woodentubes, sealed with wax. Inside those he discovered parchments which, he laterestablished, were written in code. After consulting his church superiors in Carcassonne,he travelled to Paris and the Roman Catholic occult research centre called St SulpiceFigu~e 20: The extendedpentagram identified byDavid Wood and IanCampbell in the areaaround Rennes-le-Chateau. They connectedchurches and other keylandscape features."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"148which is positioned on the Paris time meridian on a site of ‘former’ Isis/Semiramisworship. Here they employed experts in medieval texts, writings and codes. Researchso far has suggested that Sauniere’s parchments contained a genealogy dated 1244 (theyear the Cathars were slaughtered at Montsegur) which confirmed the survival of theMerovingian bloodline; another Merovingian genealogy from 1244 to 1644; and twocompiled in the 1780s apparently by Abbe Antoine Bigou, a previous priest at Rennes-le-Chateau, and personal chaplain to the Blanchefort family. I don’t believe for a secondthat this is all that Sauniere found. Anything that really mattered would never have beenmade public and it is quite possible that Sauniere did not find his parchments in thechurch at all. Maybe it’s a cover story to obscure the real tale.The Priory of Sion ‘leaked’ copies of the two Bigou parchments in 1967, or at leastin the 1960s. The Priory of Sion is believed to have originated in Troyes, France, thecity founded by the Sicabrian Franks (Merovingians) where the Templars wereofficially formed. The Priory of Sion arrived on the scene about the same time as theTemplars, the Knights of Malta and the Teutonic Knights, and it had a particularly closeassociation with the Templars. But some researchers believe the true origins of thePriory of Sion go much further back. Its Grand Masters are called Nautonnier orNavigators and the ones between 1188 and 1918 were listed (or claimed to be) indocuments known as the Dossiers Secrets, which were privately published textsdeposited at the National Library in Paris. Among them were Marie and Jean de Saint-Clair; Leonardo da Vinci; Sandro Botticelli, another Italian artist and friend of da Vinci;Nicolas Flamel, the famous medieval alchemist; Robert Fludd, the philosopher; IsaacNewton, who ‘discovered’ the law of gravity and was a major player in the creation ofthe this-world-is-all-there-is version of ‘science’; Robert Boyle, a close friend ofNewton and another founder of modern ‘science’; and Jean Cocteau, the French writerand artist. Two others in office during the lifetime of Sauniere, were the French writerand poet Victor Hugo, and his friend the composer Claude Debussy, a Grand Master ofthe Rosicrucian Order. One of Debussy’s most famous operas was a Merovingiandrama. A recent Grand Master appears to be Pierre Plantard de Saint-Clair who,according to documents revealed in Holy Blood, Holy Grail, is a descendant ofDagobert II and the Merovingian dynasty. Dagobert was the Merovingian heir who wassent into exile in Ireland as a child. He returned to take his crown, but was latermurdered. His son is supposed to have survived. I think that Pierre Plantard, however,has misled the authors of Holy Blood, Holy Grail in many ways, and the idea that theMerovingian bloodlines are the bloodline of Jesus is without foundation. This isnothing to do with Jesus. The reason you find so many references to Arcadia in relationto Rennes-le-Chateau is because Arcadia in Sparta was the legendary home of Zeus andthe Titans - the reptilian bloodlines of Troy. That is the origin of these bloodlines, notJesus, who did not even exist. Pierre Plantard, who knows the truth, but doesn’t wantyou to know, was born in 1920 and, with the approval of the German oppressors, heedited a magazine in Nazi-occupied France in 1942 called Conquest For A YoungKnighthood.17 It was the journal of a Paris based Masonic-chivalric society called the"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"149Order Alpha-Galates, and Plantard became its Grand Master at the age of 22.18 This iscertainly not a man who’s word is his bond.At St Sulpice in Paris, the village priest Abbe Berenger Sauniere met with AbbeBieil, the Director General of the Seminary, and the latter’s nephew, Emile Hoffet.19Through Hoffet he was warmly welcomed into a circle of esoteric friends, including thefamous opera singer, Emma Calve, and Claude Debussy, the Grand Master of the Prioryof Sion as well as the Rosicrucians. Sauniere and Calve began a close relationship andshe visited him at Rennes-le-Chateau. Calve was at the heart of the occult movementsin France and one of her intimates was the Marquis Stanislas de Gualta, a founder of themodern version of the Order of the Rose-Croix, the Rosicrucians.20 Most of the GrandMasters of the Priory of Sion have Rosicrucian connections. Another of Calve’s friendswas Jules Bois, a notorious Satanist, and close associate of a fellow Satanist,MacGregor Mathers.21 Encouraged by Bois, Mathers established the British occultsociety, the Order of the Golden Dawn, of which the Satanist, Aleister Crowley, was amost prominent member. The Order of the Golden Dawn and its offshoots andpersonnel, like Crowley, were involved with both the Nazis and the British Satanist,Druid, and wartime Prime Minister, Sir Winston Churchill. The pointed-arm ‘heilHitler’ salute was in fact a ritual sign of the Order of the Golden Dawn. Another famousmember of the Golden Dawn was the poet, W. B. Yeats, a friend of Claude Debussy.Yeats quite brilliantly summed up the aims of the Babylonian Brotherhood when hedescribed his ideal society:“...an aristocratic civil isation in its most completed form, every detail of his life hierachical,every great man’s door crowded at dawn with petitioners, great wealth everywhere in fewmen’s hands, all dependent upon a few, up to the Emperor himself, who is a Goddependent upon a greater God and everywhere, in Court, in the family, an inequality madelaw. “22This is precisely the vision for the human race planned by the reptilians. If Sauniereand his friends were operating among Emma Calve’s circle, we are talking Satanismhere. I’m not saying that Sauniere was a Satanist because I don’t know, but he knewpeople who were. Other famous visitors of Sauniere at Rennes-le-Chateau were theFrench Secretary of State for Culture and the Archduke Johann von Habsburg, a cousinof Franz-Josef, the Emperor of Austria.23 The Habsburgs, a big-time reptilian bloodline,ruled the Holy Roman Empire for 500 years before its demise in 1806. The Priory ofSion, the Merovingian bloodline, and Rennes-le-Chateau, definitely connect into thewider web I am exposing.Among the most significant Freemasonic lodges in the world today is the GrandAlpine Lodge in Switzerland. Henry Kissinger, one of the planet’s most active servantsof the reptilians (he is one), is a member. It is involved at a very high level in the globalmanipulation (see .. And The Truth Shall Set You Free) and it is most definitely Satanic. Awork entitled The Merovingian Descendants And The Enigma Of The Visigoth Razes was"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"150published, according to its title page, by the Grand Alpine Lodge, though they now denyit.24 Razes is the old name for the area around Rennes-le-Chateau.25 It was first publishedin German and then translated into French by a Walter Celse-Nazaire, a pseudonym ma-de up of the saints after whom the church at Rennes-les-Bains is dedicated. The secretsheld in Rennes-le-Chateau and the Languedoc are extremely important to these people.The composer, Richard Wagner, used unusual names from the Rennes area in his operasand in his work, The Valkyrie, we see again the theme of someone condemned to eternalsleep in the ruins of an enchanted castle. There are many ruined enchanted castles aroundRennes-le-Chateau and Wagner’s Castle of Valhalla is a castle on the Paris Meridian afew miles from the village.26 Adolf Hitler, who was obsessed with black magic, said thatto under-stand the Nazis, one had to understand Wagner. One legend has it that Wagnervisited Sauniere at Rennes-le-Chateau. Jules Verne, the science ‘fiction’ writer, was ahigh initiate who knew much secret knowledge. His book, Chateau Of The Carpathians,includes several names unique to the Rennes-le-Chateau area, and in Verne’s Clovisd’Ardentor, one the characters is Captain Bugarach - the name of a peak near Rennes-le-Chateau known locally as the magnetic mountain. Clovis was also the name of one of thefirst Merovingian kings. A farm near Rennes-les-Bains is called Jouanne, another nameused for a Jules Verne character.27Back in Rennes-le-Chateau after his visit to Paris, Sauniere began a spending spree wellbeyond the means of a poorly paid village priest. Where did his sudden wealth come from?He built a house which he called Villa Bethania alongside the church for himself and hishousekeeper, Marie Denarnaud. Close by, he built a watchtower on the edge of a sheer cliffoverlooking the valley and mountains. He called it La Tour Magdala and he said it was alibrary. Having seen it, I don’t believe that. There is very little room for books and it hardlyconstitutes a ‘library’. It is, however, placed precisely on the spot where a circle connectingchurches meets a point on the pentagram in the geometrical pattern identified by Wood andCampbell. The name Magdala means watchtower and the watchtower is a Brotherhoodsymbol for Mary Magdalene - the female energy, Isis, Semiramis. Note that it is also thesymbol of the Jehovah’s Witnesses, another prison-religion, created by Brotherhoodfrontmen like the high degree Freemason, Charles Taze Russell. They’re all connected, thesecret societies and the religions they created. Sauniere spent profusely on art and antiques;he paid for a water tower to improve the village supply; and he spent a fortune to build aroad to replace the long dirt track up the mountain to Rennes-le-Chateau. He also began tocorrespond with people all over Europe. Most notably, he transformed his church with hisnew-found wealth. It was fully restored and refurbished with strange statues and esotericsymbols. On the entrance to the church he had written in French: “This place is terrible”.As you walk through the door you are faced with a demonic statue depicting a particularversion of the Devil. It is Asmodeus who, the legend says, was forced by King Solomon tohelp with the building of his temple in Jerusalem. A cutting with a picture of Asmodeus inchains was found among Sauniere’s possessions. A plate glass window features MaryMagdalene anointing the feet of Jesus and a statue of Mary Magdalene includes a skull ather feet - that symbol of the Templar rituals. The floor is laid out with the black and"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"151white squares of a Masonic temple. A feature of the Sauniere-inspired decoration in thechurch is the rose and the cross. This is the symbol of the secret society called theRosicrucians or Rose Croix and it goes back to ancient times. Templar artefactsretrieved from Paris and Cyprus feature the rose and cross.28 The rose once again relatesto goddess worship and sexual symbolism. The Romans knew the rose as the Flower ofVenus (Venus = Semiramis) and it was the badge of her ‘sacred prostitutes’. In theVenus sexual mysteries, anything ‘sub rosa’ meaning under the rose, was not to berevealed to the uninitiated.29 Mother Mary, when used as a symbol for the goddessenergy, was referred to as the Rose, Rose-bush, Rose-garland or Mystic Rose.30 Thename Rose may also come from Eros, the symbol for sexual love. The Rosicrucians linkinto the Brotherhood network, as do the Jesuits. Sauniere’s brother, Alfred, was a Jesuit.The guy at the museum in Rennes-le-Chateau told me that Sauniere could have been amember of the Rosicrucian Order and I would have been surprised if he wasn’t. Thereis a cross and red rose on his grave in the churchyard. A red rose on a grave can indicatean exemplary life or that the person’s life was ended prematurely. When Pierre Plantardde Saint-Clair, a Grand Master of the Priory of Sion, made a visit to Rennes-le-Chateau,he was seen performing a strange ceremony at Sauniere’s grave. Obviously, questionswere asked by the church hierarchy about Sauniere’s spending spree, but when thecrunch came he was supported by the Pope himself.Sauniere was working closely, and in secret, with two other local priests, Abbe Boudetat Rennes-le-Bains, and Abbe Gelis at Coutaussa. The two villages are only a shortdistance from Rennes-le-Chateau. Records show that Boudet, a friend of Pierre Plantard’sgrandfather, paid Sauniere and his Jesuit brother large sums of money.31 All threeapparently enjoyed unexplained windfalls of cash. In 1897 their close association wasbroken by conflict between Sauniere and Boudet, and the vicious and bloody murder ofGelis, who had become a recluse, living behind a locked door in fear of his life. With goodreason, it turned out. He was bludgeoned to death by someone he clearly knew and trusted,because he opened his door to them and a bell alarm Gelis had installed was not activated.Despite the violence of his death and the intense struggle which preceded it, his body wasleft neatly laid out on the floor in almost ritualistic fashion.32 In his church at Coutaussawere the now familiar symbols, the lion paws, the grapes and the vine, and a form of theStar of David, the six pointed star, with one triangle superimposed on the other instead ofbeing interweaved as normal. Exactly the same symbol was found on Sauniere’sbookplate.33 On Gelis’s grave, topped by a Maltese/Templar cross, is the word Assassineand the headstone is adorned with a rose, the symbol of the Rosicrucians and of prematuredeath. Sauniere died following a stroke in 1917. The stroke happened on January 17th1917, which appears to be a very significant date to the Babylonian Brotherhood. It is thefeast day of St Sulpice. It was to St Sulpice Church in Paris that Sauniere travelled with hisparchments; it was the groundplan of St Sulpice which appeared in the mysteriousdocuments called Le Serpent Rouge; St Sulpice was designed according to the laws ofsacred geometry in 1645 on the ruins of a temple of Isis and was the headquarters of theCompagnie du Saint-Sacrement, an alleged front for the Priory of Sion; and Victor Hugo,"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"152a Grand Master of the Priory of Sion,was married at St Sulpice.

Sauniere transferred all his money andpossessions to his housekeeper, Marie Denarnaud, his confidant throughout the periodwe have been documenting.

With that which theMonsieur has left we could feed Rennes for a hundred years and there would still beenough left over... one day I will tell you a secret which will make of you a rich man -very,very rich.”35But she never did.

However, the veil is lifting and the truth is emerging.

This can be confusing unless you understand the game. Suchinfighting is inevitable with the mindset of these people, and often it suits theBrotherhood leadership to have these feuds spill over into the public arena. It createsthe very chaos, the divide and rule, which they need to manipulate their Agenda intobeing. But this upper hierarchy can quickly bring the factions into line when thefighting threatens the over all Agenda on which all sides agree - control of the world.Just such a battle broke out between the Priory of Sion and its military arm, the KnightsTemplar, which led to considerable conflict in the centuries that followed. In 1187, theTemplars lost control of Jerusalem to the Saracen Turks, possibly on purpose, and aconflict followed with their former allies and official masters, the Priory of Sion. A yearlater they formerly separated in a ritual known as the Cutting of the Elm at Gisors, acity close to the coast in northern France. The Order of Sion changed its name to thePriory of Sion and adopted as its emblem, the red cross used by the Templars. ThePriory also adopted the title, l’Ordre de la Rose-Cross Veritas, the Order of the TrueRed Cross. The two secret societies agreed to operate independently, but the Priory ofSion wanted the Templar wealth which it believed it rightly owned and it probably usedthe Merovingian king of France, Philippe the Fair, in an attempt to do this.The purge of the TemplarsFirst Philippe removed two Popes until he found one who would take his orders. He sentone of his heavies to assault and abuse Pope Boniface VIII, who died shortly afterwards.He then poisoned a second Pope, Benedict XI. This allowed him to install his own choice,the Archbishop of Bordeax, who became Pope Clement V. He moved the Papacy toAvignon and produced a split in the Roman Church for 68 years while rival Popes residedin France and in Rome. Having established his own personal Pope, Philippe turned hismind to the Knights Templar. He coveted their wealth, hated their power and was a puppetof the Priory of Sion. The Templars lost much of their influence with the Church after1291 when the Saracens defeated the Christian Crusaders and ejected them from the HolyLand. Philippe, in league with his puppet Pope, set out to destroy the Templars. In 1306he had arrested every Jew in France, banished them from the country and taken all theirproperty. He then planned a similar operation and secretly arranged for all Templars inFrance to be arrested at dawn on Friday, October 13th 1307. Friday the 13th has beendeemed unlucky ever since. Many Templars were seized, including their Grand Master,Jacques de Molay, and subjected to the unimaginable torture of the Inquisition. But thereis clear evidence that many Templars knew of the plan and escaped.Documents detailing their rules and rituals were removed or destroyed before theraids and when the vaults were opened at the Templar headquarters in Paris, the vastfortune Philippe so coveted was gone. He and his Pope pressured other monarchs toarrest the Templars, but this wasn’t easy. In the German, later French, region ofLorraine, the duke supported the Templars and in other parts of Germany the Templarswent unprosecuted. Others changed their name from Knights Templar and continued as"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"154before in another guise. Some joined the Order of St John of Jerusalem (Malta) or theTeutonic Order. The aristocratic bloodlines of Lorraine are some of the ‘purest’ reptiliancrossbreeds and one of them is today one of the biggest players in the global Satanicritual network. While officially these three orders were not connected and did not likeeach other, they were, at their upper levels, the same organisation.Edward II, the English king, did his best for years to ignore the papal order to arrestthe Templars and, when pressed further, he was as lenient with them as possible.Scotland and Ireland did the same. Eventually, however, the Inquisitors arrived and theTemplars either left England or Ireland or met their fate. Scotland was a very differentstory. The Templar fleet escaped from France at the time of the purge, particularly fromtheir main port at La Rochelle, and took their wealth with them. There is, however,another possibility that Philippe the Fair was duped by the Priory of Sion who hadarranged for the English fleet to intercept the fleeing Templar ships and steal the goldthat way. That’s possible. The Templars headed for Scotland, Portugal, and most likely,the Americas as they knew that continent existed because they had access to theunderground knowledge of the Aryan Elite and they were well aware that thePhoenicians had been to the Americas thousands of years before.The choice of Scotland was obvious for many reasons. The St Clair-Sinclairs werethere and so were the other ancient Brotherhood bloodlines which arrived with theoriginal Phoenicians or came from Belgium and northern France to settle there muchlater. The head of one of these families, Robert the Bruce, was at war with anotherbranch of the Aryans, the English, for control of Scotland and he was excommunicatedby the Pope. This meant that the papal order to destroy the Templars was not applicablein the areas controlled by Bruce. It was to here that many Templars headed after thepurge in France. They sailed around the west coast of Ireland to land on the north westcoast of Scotland between Islay, Jura and the Mull of Kintyre. Along this coast manyTemplar graves and relics have been found at places like Kilmory and Kilmartin. TheTemplars also settled in the region called Dalnada, now Argyll, and they were soon toplay a crucial part in the most famous battle in Scottish history.SOURCES1Geoffrey Higgins, Anacalypsis (reprinted in 1972 by Health Research, P0 Box 850, Pomeroy,WA 99347, USA, first published 1836).2Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh and Henry Lincoln, Holy Blood, Holy Grail (Corgi Books,London, 1982), pp 449, 450.3Joy Hancox, The Byrom Collection (Jonathan Cape, London, 1992), p 131."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"1554The Occult Conspiracy, p 48.5David Wood and Ian Campbell, Geneset (Bellevue Books, Sunbury on Thames, England,1994), pp 104, 105.6Lynn Picknett and CI ive Prince, The Templar Revelation (Bantam Press, London, 1997), p 45.7Ibid.8Ibid.9Ibid.10lbid,p49.11Ibid,p68.12Ibid.13Geneset, p 34.14Holy Blood, Holy Grail, p 33.15Geneset, p 36.16Ibid.17The Templar Revelation, p 43.18Ibid.19Holy Blood, Holy Grail, p 27.20Ibid, p 159.21Ibid.22Quoted by Francis King in Satan And Swastika (Mayflower Books, London, 1976).23Holy Blood, Holy Grail, p 29.24Ibid, p 97.25Ibid.26Geneset, p 33.27Ibid, p 33.28 The Woman’s Encyclopaedia Of Myths And Secrets, pp 866, 867.29Ibid.30Ibid.31Richard Andrews and Paul Schellenberger, The Tomb Of God (Little Brown, London, 1996), p177.32Ibid, p 187.33Ibid, p 182.34Ibid, p 259.35Ibid, pp 172, 173."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"156CHAPTER EIGHTSame face, different maskIn the years before the Templars arrived in force from France, Robert the Bruce’scampaign against the English had been pretty disastrous. He was forced to seek refugein the Perthshire mountains and later in Argyll. From there he headed for Kintyre andthe north of Ireland.Bruce had very close connections with Ulster and owned land there. Bruce’s title,the Earl of Carrick, can be seen in a number of place names in this part of Ireland,including Carrickfergus. The people of Ulster have long political and blood associationswith the Scots, particularly on the west coast of Scotland, but they have beenmanipulated into conflict many times. At the heart of the troubles in Ulster to this dayare the squabbles between the Irish (Catholics) and the Scots-Irish (Protestants) whomoved into Ulster from Scotland. These conflicts are manipulated and encouraged bythe Brotherhood through their placemen. With support from Irish noble families, Brucereturned to Scotland in 1307, the year of the Templar purge in France, and he soonfound himself fighting a new English king as Edward II replaced Edward I. Bruce’scampaign gathered momentum thanks to support and weapons from the Templarsfleeing France, and it culminated in the battle of Bannockburn, near Stirling Castle, onJohn the Baptist’s Day (Nimrod’s day), June 24th 1314. The Scots routed the Englishafter a day of battle when a force of ‘unknown’ horsemen arrived to support the Scottishranks. For some reason, never explained, the English panicked and ran at the sight ofthese reinforcements. They had to be a special fighting force and they had to beimmediately recognisable to stimulate such an instant reaction. The Templars wereboth, and this ‘unknown’ group had to be the Knights Templar, the warriors so feared inthe crusades, who had now regrouped in Scotland. The victory at Bannockburn wouldensure the independence of Scotland for the next 289 years and among those whofought with Bruce that day was Sir William St Clair of Rosslyn. When Bruce died in1329, the Stuart dynasty began. In France in Merovingian times, they appointed Mayorsof the Palace to support the monarch and from the time of King David I, Scotland hadinstalled a similar system. They were called Royal Stewards and these positions becamehereditary. It later changed to Stewart and from this line came the Stuarts. Again, aswith the Merovingians, the hereditary mayors or stewards to the official royal lineeventually became the royal line themselves. This came after Bruce’s daughter marriedWalter the Steward or Stewart. Upon Bruce’s death, the first child of this unison becameRobert II of Scotland. The Stuart line had its first king."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"157A creation of the officially disbanded Knights Templar was the Order of the Garter,the premier order of chivalry, created by Edward III in 1348 and still headed by theBritish monarch. It is an Elite front for the Babylonian Brotherhood and is dedicated tothe ‘Virgin Mary’ - Semiramis/Ninkharsag. Meetings of the Order took place underEdward in a special chamber at Windsor Castle around a table modelled on the one inKing Arthur legend. Windsor Castle is built on an ancient and very powerful sacredenergy vortex and this is where the Satanist and reptilian, Henry Kissinger, wasknighted by the Queen. She is knowingly working for the Brotherhood Agenda and theOrder of the Garter is one of her premier networks. Edward III’s name was Windsor andwhen the present royal family decided to change their German name to an English onefor public relations reasons during the First World War, they chose Windsor, after theman who founded this key Brotherhood order. The insignia of the Order of the Garter isa jewelled collar with red roses alternating with 26 gold knots representing the 26knights in two groups of 13.1 Similar orders emerged in France with the Order of theStar, the Order of the Golden Fleece, and the Order of St Michael. The Freemasons arethe Knights Templar and the Priory of Sion under another name and the Company ofJesus or Jesuits are based on the same structure as the Templars with the same goal. TheJesuits and the Knights of Malta are esoteric secret societies which hoard and use thesecret knowledge while outwardly claiming to be Roman Catholic and ‘Christian’.They are doing exactly the same as the Templars did at the time of the Crusades andtogether they control, with the higher levels of Freemasonry, the Vatican, the Pope andthe Roman Catholic Church. In other words, they control both sides, the esotericunderground and the Church which condemns this very same underground as evil. Thusthey control the game and the ultimate outcome of the game - unless we wake up fast.An obvious example of this came after the papal purge on the Templars. In 1312, alllands and property owned by the Templars were given by the Pope to their ‘rivals’ theKnights Hospitaller of St John, later called the Knights of Rhodes and now the Knightsof Malta (Catholic) and the Knights of St John (Protestant). Both were the same force,as were, and are, the Teutonic Knights. All were involved in the same things, includingbanking, and used the same vicious, unscrupulous methods to get their way. For morethan 200 years until the middle of the 16th century, the Hospitallers and the Templarswere merged into a joint order and much Templar land and property was not absorbedby the Knights Hospitaller, even though most of it was there for the taking.The Templars restored their influence in France under the title of the Scots Guard inthe mid 15th century. When Robert the Bruce was installed as the unchallenged king ofScotland, he signed a pact with Charles IV of France, renewing what was known as the‘auld alliance’. This was no surprise, given that the bloodlines which controlledScotland, including Bruce and the Sinclairs, came from France and Flanders. In 1445, alater King Charles, Charles VII, formed the first standing army in Europe since theTemplars and, in fact, it was the Templars. Pride of place in Charles’s army was theScottish Company and it was at the front of all parades. Even more powerful andinfluential, however, was the elite Scots Guard which consisted of 33 men - a very"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"158significant esoteric number which would manifest again in the 33 degrees of theScottish Rite of Freemasonry. The Scots Guard was there to guard the king and theyeven slept in his bedroom. Not all 33,1 hope. As the numbers in the guard increased itwas by multiples of 13, again in keeping with esoteric numerological laws and a keynumber to the Knights Templar. Commanders of the Scots Guard were automaticallymade members of the secret society called the Order of St Michael, which laterestablished a branch in Scotland. Another common theme of the manipulation into thepresent day is that people operating behind one ‘mask’ are also members of other,sometimes many other, ‘masks’ working to the same agenda. Yet again, the Scots Guard(Templars) proved to be expert at the Trojan Horse technique. They infiltrated and tookover the administration of France as ‘advisors’ and ‘ambassadors’. Charles was theirpuppet and the names of this Scots Guard elite are getting familiar... Sinclair, Stuart,Hamilton, Hay, Montgomery, Cunningham, Cockburn and Seton. These were thefamilies who came to Scotland from France and Flanders and could trace theirbloodlines back to the ancient Near East and the Anunnaki. They took over Scotlandand now they re-established their influence in France. The Scots Guard was anotherfront for the secret knowledge, the unfolding of the Templar Agenda, and the Satanicrituals of which the Templars had been accused. Nothing changes, except the name. Apresent member of the Montgomery family told the authors of The Temple And TheLodge that an order was formed at the time of the Scots Guard in which all malemembers of the Montgomery family were eligible. It was called the Order of theTemple.2 The Templars would later re-emerge as the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry.Another significant connection into this same network was the House of Lorraine inthe northern France-Germany region and in particular the Duke of Lorraine known asRene d’Anjou, who was born in 1408. He became Grand Master of the Priory of Sion atthe age of ten and operated under the guidance of his uncle Louis, Cardinal de Bar, untilhe was 20.~ This is a big-time reptilian bloodline. His list of titles included Count ofProvence (in Rennes-le-Chateau country), Count of Guise, Duke of Anjou, King ofHungary, King of Naples and Sicily, King of Aragon, Valencia, Majorca and Sardinia,and the symbolic one of King of Jerusalem.4 The latter title is very important to theBrotherhood. The next in line for King of Jerusalem is the reptilian, Karl von Habsburg,and his name, numerologically, equates to 666. One of Rene d’Anjou’s daughtersmarried Henry VI of England in 1445 and was prominent in the Wars of the Roses inwhich the red rose of Henry of Lancaster met the white rose of York in 1455. Rened’Anjou had connections in every direction and he was a classic Brotherhood figure atthe centre of a vast web. Just two of the famous names of history to whom he wasconnected were Christopher Columbus and Joan of Arc. At one time he employedChristopher Columbus and the enormous significance of this will become clear soon.Joan of Arc, it appears, was born as a subject of Rene d’Anjou in the duchy of Bar.According to official history, in 1429 she announced her ‘divine mission’ to save Francefrom the English invaders and to ensure that Charles became king of France, as he didas Charles VII. She asked for an audience with Rene d’Anjou’s father-in-law and great"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"159uncle and when the meeting took place, Rene, was present.5 To fulfil her mission, shesaid, according to the official tale, she needed Rene, a horse, and: “some good men totake me into France”. Historians who chronicled Rene’s life suggest that he left withJoan to meet with Charles and was at her side in her victorious battles against theEnglish which put Charles on the throne. His whereabouts cannot be accounted forbetween the years 1429-1431, the very years when Joan of Arc was at the peak of hermilitary career. Joan was eventually burned at the stake by the Inquisition as a witchand it is very clear when you look at the evidence that her whole story was anotherhistorical smokescreen. We are supposed to believe that this young girl from a poorbackground knocked on the door of the aristocracy and they allowed her to lead a waragainst the English. Yes, OK, and I can tie my willy to the lamppost across the street.The man who was really behind that military campaign was Rene d’Anjou with thestory of Joan of Arc (based on the legend of the ‘Virgin of Lorraine’) merely aconvenient way of hiding the real goings on.It was Rene d’Anjou who was responsible for the two-bar cross becoming known asthe Cross of Lorraine. The double cross symbol was later used by some aspects of theChristian Church and it is the origin of the term to be ‘double crossed’, manipulated.This has become another symbol of the reptilian Brotherhood and you can see it in thelogo of the oil giant, Exxon, controlled by their American branch managers, theRockefellers. Rene d’Anjou was steeped in the esoteric underground and a student ofthe Arthurian and Grail legends. Through his extensive possessions and connections inItaly he interlocked with the Black Nobility and other aristocratic families and he wasan inspiration behind the emergence of the Renaissance when the ancient knowledge ofEgypt and Greece was translated into European languages. In Rene d’Anjou’s court wasan astrologer called Jean de Saint-Remy and, according to several accounts, he was thegrandfather of the most famous psychic-astrologer of all time, Nostradamus. Thismakes sense because in the 16th century Nostradamus was closely connected to theHouse of Lorraine and it’s offshoot, the House of Guise, as they pursued a bloodycampaign of assassination against their bloodline rivals in a bid, ultimatelyunsuccessful, to win the throne of France. His very name gives his background away.Nostradamus’ real name was Michel de Notre Dame, Michael of Our Lady. The Frenchwriter and investigator, Gerard de Sede, who it seems had insider contacts, claimed thatNostradamus was an agent for the Houses of Lorraine and Guise and was using hisposition as astrologer to the French court to manipulate on their behalf. De Sede furthersuggests that many of the predictions or ‘quatrains’ by Nostradmus were not so muchpredictions as messages, ciphers, timetables, instructions and symbolism of past eventsand groups. He says that Nostradamus spent a long time in Lorraine being trainedbefore he entered the royal court of their rivals and in this period he was given access toan ancient book on which all his work became based. No wonder he was apparentlysuch a brilliant astrologer, he knew what few others were privileged to know.Incidentally, Gerard de Sede also claims that the Merovingian bloodline areextraterrestrials which, of course, has been dismissed as ludicrous, but I say he’s right."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"160At least they are a ‘royal’ bloodline which has been occupied and controlled by thereptilians of the lower fourth dimension.6In the 16th and 17th centuries, a stream of events unfolded to advance theBrotherhood Agenda. The extent and influence of the underground esoteric networkshad continued to expand and now it was possible to begin the next stage of the globaltakeover. Rene d’Anjou was one of the key players behind the Renaissance when,through his many contacts in Italy and particularly Florence, he helped to orchestratethe translation, publishing and distribution of ancient Greek, Egyptian and Gnosticworks, including those of Plato and Pythagoras. This transformed art and culture amongthe privileged classes of Europe and the power of the church was under more challengethan ever before. It also enlisted many more influential people into the gathering secretsociety network. The pressure on the church establishment was increased still further bythe publication of the Rosicrucian Manifestos in 1614 to 1616 which claimed to beissued by a secret group of initiates in Germany and France. They pledged to transformthe world with the esoteric knowledge and herald a new era of religious and politicalfreedom. The Catholic Church and the Holy Roman Empire were fiercely condemned.The Order of the Rose Cross or Rosicrucians, however, was no new fad. It wasfounded, apparently, at least as long ago as the Pharaoh Thothmes III in the 15thcentury BC. His personal seal (cartouche) is used on modern Rosicrucian literature7 andthe Rosicrucians connect with the Royal Court of the Dragon in ancient Egypt. It is nowwidely believed by researchers that the Manifestos were written by the Germanesotericist, Johann Valentin Andrea, who is listed as a Grand Master of the Priory ofSion. Another highly influential voice for Rosicrucian thought was Robert Fludd, theman who preceded Andrea as Grand Master of the Priory of Sion.The Bacon legacyOne of the most important men of this entire era was the Rosicrucian, Francis Bacon. Hisinfluence was colossal. He was the Grand Master of the Rosicrucians in England, amajor force in the creation of Freemasonry, the ‘father’ of modern science, and thepossible author of the ‘Shakespeare’ plays. He was also a member of a secret societycalled the Order of the Helmet, dedicated to the worship of the goddess of wisdom,Pallas Athene, who was portrayed as wearing a helmet and holding a spear.8 Researchersand investigators like Manly P. Hall, the renowned Freemasonic historian, have littledoubt that Bacon was born from a liaison between Queen Elizabeth I, the ‘virgin queen’,and her lover Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester.9 He was brought up by Nicholas andAnne Bacon and would become the most influential man in the country, overtly andcovertly, with the title of Viscount of St Albans and the role of Lord Chancellor ofEngland. (This was the Bacon role, you might say.) If Bacon was the son of QueenElizabeth (El-lizard-birth), he was of a reptilian bloodline, and this would explain hisrapid rise to prominence in politics and the secret societies. He worked secretly throughthe underground channels, among them the Inns of Court, the centre of the Brotherhood-controlled legal profession which is based on the former Templar lands in the now aptly"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"161named, Temple Bar, in London. It was a time of great conflict and upheaval as theBrotherhood sought to use the church as a vehicle for widespread war and chaos. Oneof their frontmen for this was Martin Luther, a product of German secret societies and aRosicrucian. His personal seal was a rose and cross. In 1517, this professor of theologyat Wittenberg University listed 95 complaints against the Vatican for selling pardons toraise money to build St Peter’s Church. Luther was excommunicated, but he burned thedecree along with copies of Roman Church law and launched his own Lutheran Church.Protestant Christianity had begun and conflict was unleashed across Europe asProtestants and Catholics went to war to decide which version of the same nonsensewould prevail. Funny that the Rosicrucians claimed to stand for religious and politicalfreedom and yet one of their puppets, Martin Luther, stood for anything but. He hatedfreethinking and open minded research. In one sermon he said that his followers shouldthrow spit in the face of reason, because she was the Devil’s whore, rotten with the itchof leprosy, and should be kept in the toilet.10 Lovely. He also wrote:“Damned be love into the abyss of hell, if it is maintained to the damage of faith... It isbetter that tyrants should sin a hundred times against the people than the people shouldsin once against the tyrants... the ass wants to be thrashed, the mob to be governed byforce.”11Speak for yourself, darlin’. A Frenchman, known in English as John Calvin, alsoproduced his version of Protestant Christianity, another extreme and arrogant creedcalled Calvinism. This spawned the Puritan movement which was so influential in theEuropean occupation of North America. The Protestant Church came to Englandbecause King Henry VIII wanted a son and heir and his first wife, Catherine of Aragon,had produced ‘only’ a daughter. He wanted to divorce her and try his luck elsewhere,but Pope Clement VII refused to sanction this. Henry at this time was a committedCatholic, at least in public, and the Pope had awarded him the title Defender of theFaith. Ironically, this same title, awarded by a Roman Catholic Pope, is still held byBritish monarchs to this day to defend the Protestant faith! You’ve got to chuckle,really. What a farce it all is. Henry, being much miffed by the Pope’s refusal to sanctionhis divorce, ordered Parliament to create a Church of England, independent of Rome.He made himself the head of the new Church in the Act of Supremacy of 1534 andunleashed a bloody purge against Roman Catholics. Henry was succeeded by his onlyson, Edward, but after he died at the age of 15, he was replaced by Henry’s daughter,Mary. She was a staunch Roman Catholic who earned the title ‘bloody Mary’ for herpurge of Protestants. Mary had secured the throne by executing her rival, Lady JaneGrey, the ‘six-day queen’. With Mary’s death came the legendary reign of Elizabeth I,Henry’s daughter by Anne Boleyn. Elizabeth executed her rival, Mary Queen of Scots,from the House of Stuart, and Elizabeth proceeded to restore the Church of Englandwith herself as Supreme Head. She ordered a purge against Catholics which was to earnher the title of ‘bloody Elizabeth’. Nice family."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"162It was against this backdrop that Francis Bacon emerged as a very high initiate of thesecret knowledge in the reign of his probable mother Elizabeth I, and her successorJames I, the Scottish king who united the English and Scottish monarchy when he wascrowned in 1603 as the first king of both countries. It was Bacon, with Robert Fludd,Grand Master of the Priory of Sion, who oversaw the translation of the King Jamesversion of the Bible, a book which, according to a study in 1881, has at least 36,1~translation errors. Given that Bacon was an extremely educated and intelligent man, Ican’t believe that such a mess could have been made of the Bible translation on such ascale unless it was meant that way. Bacon also removed the two Books of Maccabeesfrom his version which, significantly, were hostile to the secret society called theNazarenes, a Brotherhood offshoot at the time of the mythical Jesus. Bacon has alsobeen dubbed the ‘father’ of modern science - this-world-is-all-there-is science - whichhas focused only on the physical level of existence. Why would Bacon support such aversion of ‘science’ when he was an advanced initiate of the secret knowledge andknew the truth? There’s something seriously not right about all this, especially whenyou consider that other ‘fathers’ of modern science like Isaac Newton and Robert Boylewere also advanced initiates as Grand Masters of the Priory of Sion. Here you haveBacon, a leading initiate of the secret knowledge, involved, via the Rosicrucians andother networks, in the dividing of the Christian Church, the writing of the ChristianBible, and the creation of modern ‘science’ which challenged many of the basicfoundations of Christianity. He was playing two sides against each other to create anenvironment in which another, unspoken, Agenda could flourish. Certainly this periodproduced the classic control system of divide and rule. Mass slaughter erupted acrossEurope in the Protestant-Catholic wars, while, at the same time, both creeds were beingchallenged by the emerging ‘scientific’ dogma.It was also under the influence of Bacon and other esoteric magicians like John Deeand Sir Francis Walsingham, that the spy networks across Europe, now known as BritishIntelligence, were created. British Intelligence was formed by the reptilian bloodlines ofthe Babylonian Brotherhood and British Intelligence would later create AmericanIntelligence and similar networks throughout the expanding British Empire, which arestill at work today. The CIA was created by Elite members of British Intelligence duringthe presidency of the 33rd degree Freemason, Harry S. Truman, the man who officiallyordered the bombs to be dropped on Japan. He took his advice from Bill Donovan, thehead of the CIA’s predecessor, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which was peopledentirely by Knights Templar according to Bill Cooper, a former operative with US NavalIntelligence. Walsingham was posted as ambassador to France to expand the spy networksand it was no surprise when a French Intelligence agent told me that British and FrenchIntelligence are the same organisation. It certainly makes the cover up of Princess Diana’smurder easier. The intelligence agencies of the world, at their peaks, are esoteric, blackmagic secret societies working to the same Agenda - global control. John Dee was theQueen’s astrologer, a Rosicrucian Grand Master, a black magician, and a secret agent forthe new intelligence network. He appears to have had a copy of the Book of Enoch from"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"163some source or other and he, and the psychic Edward Kelley, developed a writtenlanguage they called ‘Enochian script or cipher’ from communications with the angels -reptilians. Dee signed his reports 007- the same, of course, as James Bond, the storieswritten by a 20th century agent of this same British Intelligence, Ian Fleming, a friendof the black magician, Aleister Crowley. Dee travelled throughout Europe manipulating,gathering information and oiling the networks. One of his haunts was Bohemia and he wasclosely associated with Emperor Rudolf II of the reptilian Habsburg dynasty, anotheroccultist.12 Dee was among the influential voices who were orchestrating a policy ofBritish expansionism which became the British Empire. While in Prague, Dee gaveEmperor Rudolph an illustrated manuscript written in code and claimed to be the work ofRoger Bacon (Roger, not Francis), the 13th century Franciscan monk who upset the churchauthorities with his views and ideas. These included prophecies about the microscope,telescope, car, submarine, aeroplane and the belief that the Earth was a sphere and not flat.In 1912, this same manuscript was bought by an American book dealer called WilfredVoynich and became known as the Voynich Manuscript. When he sent copies to theexperts of the day, they said that most of the hundreds of plants illustrated did not grow onthis planet. Some of the illustrations looked like tissue seen under a microscope and otherswere of star systems and constellations. The best code breakers available to United StatesIntelligence in both the First and Second World Wars tried to decipher what they called:“the most mysterious manuscript in the world”, but none of them could do it. WilliamRomaine Newbold, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, claimed to have decodedsome of it in 1921. He said that part of the text read:“In a concave mirror, I saw a star in the form of a snail between the navel of Pegasus, thegirdle of Andromeda, and the head of Cassiopeia.”13What is described in the manuscript acquired by Dr John Dee is now known to beaccurate and the illustration it contains of the Andromeda nebula is also correct, but it isdepicted from an angle which cannot be seen from Earth! This manuscript is just oneexample of the level of knowledge the Brotherhood were working with hundreds ofyears ago while their other wing, the religions, were keeping the masses in the mostbasic ignorance. In this John Dee-Francis Bacon circle were all the leading figures ofElizabethan society, including Sir Walter Raleigh. It may have been Francis Bacon whocommunicated some of the secret knowledge ‘for those who have ears’ in ciphers andsymbolism in the works called the Shakespeare plays. He, like the writers of the Old andNew Testaments and the King Arthur ‘Grail’ stories, was a high initiate of the secretmysteries communicating through code and hidden meaning. Manly P. Hall says thatBacon indicated that he was the true author in a series of codes. His esoteric number was33 and on one page in the first part of the ‘Shakespeare’ play, Henry The Fourth, thename ‘Francis’ appears 33 times. Bacon also used watermarks in paper to transmit hissymbols, as did the Rosicrucians and secret societies in general. These included the roseand the cross and bunches of grapes - the vine, the bloodlines.14 Bacon also used Tarot"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"164symbolism in his codes, including the numbers 21, 56 and 78, which are related todivisions in the Tarot deck.15 In a Shakespearean Folio of 1623, the Christian name ofBacon appears 21 times on page 56.16 The term Rota Mundi frequently occurs in theearly manifestos of the Fraternity of the Rose Cross. Rearrange the letters in Rota andyou get Taro, the ancient name for the tarot cards.’7 Shakespeare is known as the Bard.A Bard was a Druidic initiate of the secret knowledge and, the Concise OxfordDictionary tells me, there is another definition of bard... “a slice of bacon placed onmeat or game before roasting”. The famous Globe Theatre in London where the playswere performed was built according to the principles of sacred geometry and the last‘Shakespeare’ play, The Tempest, included many Rosicrucian concepts.18 It is equallypossible that the ‘Shakespeare’ plays were written by another initiate of Elizabethansociety, Edward De Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford, who also fitted the bill and somebelieve even more so than Bacon.The idea that the world famous plays were written by an illiterate from Stratford-upon-Avon called William Shakespeare is patently ridiculous and, like so much accepted ‘truth’,does not survive the most basic research. Shakespeare, the ‘Bard’, grew up in Stratford, atown with no school capable of communicating such a high degree of learning. His parentswere illiterate and he showed a total disregard for study. Yet the plays were written bysomeone with a great knowledge of the world which could be gleaned only from afantastic range of books and personal experience through travel. Shakespeare had no suchlibrary, not that he could have used it if he had, and he is never known to have left thecountry. Bacon had just such a library and travelled widely to many of the places featuredin the plays. Where did Shakespeare acquire his knowledge of French, Italian, Spanish,Danish and classic Latin and Greek? Answer, he didn’t. Ben Jonson, a close friend ofShakespeare, said that the ‘Bard’ understood: “small Latin and less Greek!”19 But Baconand DeVere were learned in these languages. Shakespeare’s daughter, Judith, was known tobe illiterate and could not even write her name at the age of 27.20 It really makes sense thata man who wrote so eloquently would have a daughter who could not write her signature.There are only six known examples of Shakespeare’s own handwriting, all signatures, andthree of these are on his will. They reveal a man unfamiliar with a pen and a hand that wasprobably guided by another. His will included his second best bed and a broad silver giltbowl, but nothing whatsoever to suggest that he wrote or owned a single work ofliterature!21 Nor is there one authentic portrait of Shakespeare. The differences in thedepiction of him by artists confirm that no-one has any idea what he looked like. Yet thepower of conditioning and accepting the official line attracts millions of people to Stratfordfrom all over the world to see the home of the man who didn’t write the Shakespeare plays!This is only one small example of how the official fairy story called ‘history’ is used tocontrol current behaviour and perception. What else in history isn’t true? Just abouteverything. Behind the Shakespeare plays was the hidden hand behind most historicalevents of significance - the Brotherhood networks. And nothing sums up the attitude of thisgroup better than the words Bacon/DeVere wrote for the witches in his play, Macbeth:“Fair is foul and foul is fair.” As Manly P. Hall, the Freemasonic historian, wrote of Bacon:"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"165“He was a Rosicrucian, some have intimated the Rosicrucian. If not actually the IllustriousFather C.R.C. referred to in the Rosicrucian manifestos, he was certainly a high initiate ofthe Rosicrucian Order... those enthusiasts who for years have struggled to identify SirFrancis Bacon as the true “Bard of Avon” might long since have won their case had theyemphasised its most important angle, namely, that Sir Francis Bacon, the Rosicrucianinitiate, wrote into the Shakespearean plays the secret teachings of the Fraternity of R.C.and the true rituals of the Freemasonic Order, of which order it may be discovered that hewas the actual founder.“22The rituals and symbols of Freemasonry can be traced back to ancient Egypt andbeyond. In truth, its knowledge of sacred geometry, numbers and form, go back to beforethe last cataclysm. The Dionysiac Artificers or Architects, composed of initiates of theBacchus-Dionysus (Sun) Mysteries whose role it was to design the public buildings andmonuments, can be traced back at least three thousand years if not more.23 It was thesearchitect-initiates who designed the great buildings of Constantinople, Rhodes, Athensand Rome and it was this same stream who built the temple to the goddess Diana at theworld centre for the Diana cult at Ephesus,24 which is remembered as one of the wondersof the ancient world. The Dionysiac Architects were connected with a secret societycalled the lonians (hence the island of lona in Scotland) who were apparently the peoplewho commissioned the Temple of Diana. Under other names, the Dionysian Architectsand initiates from the Frater Solomonis mystery school also built great ChristianCathedrals funded by the Knights Templar. There were many Rosicrucian and Masonicemblems to be seen in the carvings of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris and numerousdepictions of compasses, squares and building tools before they were destroyed duringthe French Revolution.25 The Bacchus-Dionysus architects were divided intocommunities headed by Masters and Wardens, just as Freemasonry is today, and theysettled in Israel where some researchers link them with the Essenes, the Egyptian sectwho produced the Dead Sea Scrolls.26 Bacchus-Dionysus (two names for the same deity)was a symbol of the Sun who was said to have been born to a virgin on December 25th.The foundation of Freemasonic legend and ‘history’ centres on the building of thesymbolic King Solomon’s Temple in Jerusalem. The Freemasonic hero is Hiram Abiff,the ‘son of the widow’ in their folklore. This is more symbolism. In Egypt, Horus(Tammuz) was the son of the widow, Isis.The creation of Freemasonry in the 16th and 17th centuries pulled together many ofthe various themes, agendas and organisations I have highlighted so far. It connectedthe Rosicrucians and Templars in England, like Bacon, with the story of the Templarsafter their arrival from France at the time of Philippe the Fair, and their subsequentreturn to France as the Scots Guard. It also connects this group with the Priory of Sion.The figure which encapsulated these connections was James VI of Scotland, whosucceeded Elizabeth I and became James I of England and Scotland. He was the onlychild of Mary Queen of Scots. The Stuart bloodline with its connections to the reptilianMerovingians was now on the throne of both England and Scotland. Under James’s"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"166patronage, the Scottish and Templar knowledge and the Rosicrucian knowledge ofFrancis Bacon and others could merge and become united under the name, Freemasonry.So could the knowledge of the reptilian House of Lorraine, another bloodline of KingJames. He had the whole set, this guy. For this reason, and others, you find the names‘James’ and ‘St James’ appear many times in the titles of Brotherhood companies,organisations and their locations. The American ambassador to London is known as theAmbassador to the Court of St James. Close to the Houses of Parliament in London youfind St James’s Square and here is the headquarters of the Conservative Party; thebiggest British trade union, the Transport Union; a building owned by the Scottishreptilian bloodline, the Keswicks (of which more later); and in the centre is a massiveround church dedicated to St John (Nimrod).One of his first acts as King James I of England and Scotland was to award aknighthood to Bacon, and James would later appoint him Solicitor-General, Attorney-General, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal and, in 1618, Lord Chancellor and BaronVerulam. Later Bacon was prosecuted on corruption charges and retired from officialpublic life. In those early years under James I, there was a wonderful opportunity tocirculate the suppressed knowledge of the ancient world if that was really the motivationof the James-Bacon esoteric underground. But again we have the contradiction. The veryopposite happened. James employed Bacon to edit the King James version of the Bibleand launched a vicious condemnation of ‘witches and wizards’ - those among the generalpopulation who used and communicated the esoteric knowledge. More than that, heembarked on a vicious slaughter of them, killing thousands, and he even wrote a bookexplaining how they should be identified and dealt with. Why do that if, as claimed, themotivation of this underground stream was to protect and eventually circulate suchinformation? Because that was never the idea. It helps if people whose support you needthink that is your motivation, but when it comes to the crunch you walk the other way.The hierarchy of the groups I have been highlighting don’t want to make the knowledgeavailable, they want to hoard it and use it to gain power on a global scale. To be honestI’m fed up with hearing of how the Freemasons, Templars, Rosicrucians, Bacon andothers, have been protectors of the knowledge when every time the climate has beenright to make it public, including today, the opportunity is spurned. It’s bullshit. Theyknow that knowledge is power if you have it and others do not, so the last thing theirhierarchy wants is an informed population. Throughout Europe, the wizards and witches,the sensitives and psychics in other words, were burned, drowned, jailed and tortured, onthe orders of people like King James and Martin Luther. Yet these were initiates usingthe same knowledge the ‘wizards and witches’ were using and communicating. Therewere two esoteric undergrounds and still are. The one among the people which passed onthe knowledge in secret, myth and fairy tale, to avoid the wrath of the religious andpolitical establishment; and the Babylonian Brotherhood underground which wanted thatknowledge for itself to control and manipulate the religious and political establishment.So the peoples’ underground was, and is, constantly attacked and pursued by theBrotherhood underground. Some 250,000 were murdered for being ‘wizards and witches’,"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"16730,000 of them in the British Isles alone.27The Freemasonic movement was to become a sort of central meeting place andcoordinator for the various elements of the Brotherhood network. W. Wynn Westcott,founder of the Hermetic (and Satanic) Order of the Golden Dawn, knew the truebackground to Freemasonry because of his connections to the esoteric underground. Hewrote in his work, The Magical Mason, that the Freemasons originate from the Essenes,the Pharisee (Levite) Jews, the ancient mystery schools of Egypt and Greece, the Vehm-Gerichte of Westphalia, Germany, the Roman Collegia, the French Compagnons, andthe Rosicrucians.28 The official (and inaccurate) story is that Freemasonry emergedfrom the lodges of the stone masons who worked on the great churches and cathedrals,craftsmen with the knowledge of sacred geometry. They had enjoyed a close connectionwith the Knights Templar since the building of the Gothic cathedrals. But by the time ofHenry VIII, their work was in decline. Far from building more cathedrals, Henry setabout looting the monasteries and the fraternities, brotherhoods and guilds to raise somemuch needed cash. To survive, the Masonic guilds began to open their doors to non-Masons, people from the professional classes, the businessmen, merchants, landownersand the aristocracy. It was now freemasonry and, of course, the newcomers took overthe show very quickly, we are told. What happened, in truth, is that the KnightsTemplar-Rosicrucian-Babylonian Brotherhood underground, created their own initiationstructure to pass on the secret knowledge to the chosen few and keep it out ofcirculation. The mason guilds were simply a cover story.Freemasonry was born in Scotland among the familiar Brotherhood bloodlinefamilies, especially the reptilian St Clair/Sinclairs. They were based at Rosslyn orRoslin Castle just south of Edinburgh in a region steeped in Templar tradition. Like allof these bloodline families, they periodically change their name to hide their origins.This line became the St Clairs while they were living in Normandy before they crossedthe English Channel with William the Conqueror for the Battle of Hastings in 1066 andbecame the Scottish Sinclairs. Five of the nine St Clairs who took part in the battle wereWilliam’s first cousins and one of them settled in Scotland to found the Scottishdynasty.29 The family apparently named themselves St Clair after a martyred hermitnamed Clare, or that’s the official line.30 They were the Norsemen who came down fromScandinavia to occupy what they called Normandy, but their true origin was with thewhite races and reptile-Aryans which emerged from the Near East and the Caucasus.The foundations were laid for Rosslyn Chapel in 1446 and it was completed in the1480s. It is a mass of esoteric and later Freemasonic symbolism and it is like a shrinefor the Brotherhood. The Sinclairs had extensive connections to the undergroundnetworks in France, Lorraine and Guise, and with Scandinavia, Denmark and the one-time Brotherhood financial centre in Venice. They were steeped in the reptiliannetwork. A Sinclair went ashore in North America with the Black Nobility Venetian,Nicolo Zeno, a century before Christopher Columbus would do so officially. One of thesymbols at Rosslyn Chapel is the Pagan vegetation god or ‘Green Man’. Tim Wallace-Murphy wrote in his official history of Rosslyn Chapel that the Green Man can be"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"168identifiedwith Tammuz, the dying and resurrecting god of Babylon and an aspect ofNimrod. Tammuz, and other names for the same deity, was often depicted to have a greenface. This includes Osiris, the husband-brother of Isis. The story of Robin Hood in his‘Lincoln green’ originated with this Green Man deity. Robin Hood began in the originallegend as a species of ‘fairy’ and he was also known as Green Robin, Robin ofGreenwood and Robin Goodfellow.31 His “Shakespearean” version, Puck, in AMidsummer Night’s Dream, presided over fertility and sexual rites at the summer solstice.On May 1st, May Day, they had the May Pole ceremonies. The May Pole is a phallicsymbol dedicated to the goddess of sexuality and fertility and on that day every villagevirgin would be a Queen of the May (Queen Semiramis). Many would end up in the greenwood to undergo a sexual initiation with a youth playing the role of Robin Hood or RobinGoodfellow. The children that often followed nine months later were the origin of the nowcommon names Robinson and Robertson.32 The story of Robin Hood was anothersymbolic tale to maintain the memory of Pagan sexual ritual amid the crossed legs andscowling faces of orthodox Christianity. A play called Robin Hood and Little John wasperformed every May and June at Rosslyn by gypsies or other travelling performers. SirWilliam Sinclair became, for a time, a protector of gypsies when legislation was passed inScotland designed to wipe them out. The gypsies originated in Egypt and they carried theknowledge from place to place and generation to generation. This is why they have beenso persecuted and hounded until most of their knowledge disappeared.The biggest rite of world Freemasonry are the 33 degrees (initiation levels) calledthe Scottish Rite. It is named after that little country in the north of the British Islesbecause that is where many of the ancient bloodlines settled to be followed by theTemplar knowledge at the time of Philippe the Fair. Now the Templars had re-emergedpublicly under another name - Freemasonry. The other main stream of the ‘craft’ is theYork Rite, after which New York is named, which is the centre of United StatesFreemasonry to this day. Some researchers believe that the Priory of Sion wrestedcontrol of the Scottish and York Rites from the Templars who later crossed the EnglishChannel to found French Freemasonry. This may be true, but in the end they are all thesame organisation at the highest level. You can still see the influence of the Templars inthe degrees of the York Rite. The top degree is the Knights Templar Degree, followedby the Knights of Malta Degree and the Red Cross Degree. But the official degrees areonly what they admit to. Above these levels are what I call the Illuminati degrees whichvery, very few people even know about, never mind reach. The vast majority ofFreemasons never progress beyond the bottom three levels, the ‘blue degrees’, and theyare used as a front of respectability to hide the real Agenda which the rank and file arenot aware of. Albert Pike was the head of the Southern Jurisdiction of the Scottish Riteof Freemasonry in the United States in the last century and is considered a Freemasonic‘god’ in America. His statue stands in Washington DC. In his Freemasonic book,Morals And Dogma, he writes on page 819:“The blue degrees are, but the outer court or portico of the temple. Part of the symbols are"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"169displayed there to the initiate, but he is intentionally misled by false interpretations. It is notintended that he shall understand them, but it is intended that he shall imagine heunderstands them.”Put another way, keep them in the dark and feed them bullshit. This is the classicsecret society structure in which only the highest levels know what is really going on.The rest are sold a myth. In the mid-i 7th century, the Thirty Years War between theProtestant and Catholic believers had turned Europe into a cauldron of death andmayhem. It was feared at one stage that the new Protestant movement would be routedand the rule of Rome restored. Britain became a safe haven for the Protestant cause,particularly under the royal house of Stuart, which ironically was not Christian at all.But the split the Protestants created in the Christian Church, and the way the power ofRome was thus diminished, suited the Brotherhood. The British Isles became the focusfor esoteric thought in Europe and the creation of Freemasonry wove these strandstogether in one structure. Freemasonry was to quickly become a vehicle for politicaland economic manipulation, its members working through all sides to the same end.The Agenda in this period was to diminish the power of the monarchies in Europe andreplace them with political systems designed in a way that allowed the Brotherhood tocontrol them. It was based on the structure in ancient Sumer and Babylon and this hascontinued to this very day. A series of civil wars were triggered throughout Europewhich either removed the monarchy or made them mere puppets. In the English CivilWar of 1642-1646, the Stuart king and Freemason, Charles I, was defeated and laterexecuted. The monarchy was briefly overthrown and replaced by a Lord Protector,Oliver Cromwell, also a Freemason. This may sound strange and contradictory, but itisn’t. The Agenda is the prime motivation, in fact the only motivation, of theBrotherhood. If that means replacing a Freemason and a Stuart who won’t follow theAgenda with a Freemason who will, then so be it. The end of the royal line for theStuarts is not as significant as it would seem. The Brotherhood Elite and the reptiliansdo not care who introduces their Agenda, so long as someone does and the mostinfluential of their bloodlines are not always the most famous people. Often the mostinfluential ones work in the background where the real power lies. The Stuarts were finefor a while, but everyone is expendable to the cause and by now the structures were inplace to run countries via the secret society networks, using frontmen and women. Thepower of a single monarch was over and that was certainly the case in the UK after thebeheading of Charles I. Even when the monarchy was restored with Charles II, it was apuppet of the Brotherhood and took orders in the same way that Oliver Cromwell didwhen, in 1655, he allowed ‘Jewish’ (Aryan) people to return to England for the firsttime since they were excluded by Edward I in 1290. As I described earlier, this was thetime when the Black Nobility in Amsterdam were preparing to put their man, Williamof Orange, on the British throne.Everything interconnects with everything else in the most remarkable way because itis being coordinated from the lower fourth dimension which can see into this one. The"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"170Christian Church was split into rival and violent factions by the Rosicrucian, MartinLuther, and the emergence of a vicious brand of the Protestant faith called Calvinism,later known as the Puritans. Its founder ‘John Calvin’ was actually Jean Caum fromNoyons, France, who was educated at the Brotherhood-controlled, College du Montagu.This is also where Ignatius Loyola, the ‘Catholic’ founder of the Society of Jesus, theJesuits, was educated. Caum moved to Paris and then to Geneva, Switzerland, where hewas known as Cohen. This name relates to ‘priest’ and goes back to the Egyptianmystery schools. In Geneva he developed, or someone else did, the philosophy knownas Calvinism. He changed his name again from Cohen to Calvin to make it moreacceptable to the English who now became the prime target of this new religion - yetanother created by the same source as all the others. Calvinism was a designer religionfor the next stage of the plan. It focused rigidly on the ten commandments of ‘Moses’and the Old Testament texts (taken literally, not symbolically of course). But this wasthe crucial bit. Up to this point the Christian religion had banned usury, the charging ofinterest on loans. Now, with the Black Nobility bankers manoeuvring to take overEngland, a Christian country, using the outwardly ‘Christian’ aristocracy, the time hadcome to end that rule and make usury the norm. Calvinism, therefore, supported thecharging of interest and one of the great beneficiaries was Switzerland, where the plotwas conceived, because it became the centre of the world’s private banking system.Another role for Calvinism was to insist on the burning of witches and in so doing takemore of the secret knowledge out of public circulation. The Black Nobility wanted theirman, William of Orange, on the throne and to do this they had to remove Charles I, theguy they eventually beheaded in 1649. Calvinism was used to ferment unrest with themonarchy and along came the Freemason and Calvinist, Oliver Cromwell, to play hispart in yet another manufactured conflict as his Roundheads met the Royalists in theEnglish Civil War. On September 3rd 1921, a publication by Lord Alfred Douglascalled Plain English presented the contents of correspondence relating to the plotbehind the murder of Charles I. It said that volumes of records had been found in theSynagogue of Mulheim by a L. A. Van Valckert. They were written in German and hadbeen lost since the Napoleonic Wars. An entry for June 6th 1647, from Oliver Cromwellto an Ebenezer Pratt, says (in modern language):“In return for financial support will advocate admission of Jews to England; this, however,impossible while Charles living. Charles cannot be executed without trial, adequate groundsfor which at present do not exist. Therefore, advise that Charles be assassinated, but willhave nothing to do with procuring an assassin, though willing to help with his escape.”Ebenezer Pratt’s reply was on July 12th 1647:“Will grant financial aid as soon as Charles removed and Jews admitted. Assassination toodangerous. Charles should be given the opportunity to escape. His recapture will thenmake trial and execution possible. The support will be liberal, but useless to discuss terms"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"171until trial commences.”34This publication was so revealing that the Brotherhood network had the publisher,Lord Alfred Douglas, imprisoned on the basis of an alleged ‘libel’ printed in his paperabout Winston Churchill. How it is possible to libel a Satanist like Churchill is rather hardto comprehend. That correspondence between Cromwell and Pratt was mirrored by actualevents. On November 12th 1647, Charles I was allowed to escape and in fact was ‘hidden’on the Isle of Wight, just off the southern coast of England, where I am writing thissection. Charles was recaptured and when he and Parliament appeared to be close to anagreement that would spare his life, Cromwell, by now Lord Protector, dismissed all themembers supporting an agreement. History calls what remained the ‘Rump Parliament’.Another trial was ordered by Cromwell because his agreement with his backers inAmsterdam was that Charles would be executed. The indictment against Charles wasdrawn up by Isaac Dorislaus, the agent in England of Manasseh ben Israel, one of themain funders from Amsterdam of the Cromwell ‘revolution’ ~ The outcome of the ‘trial’was the public beheading of Charles and this was followed by Cromwell allowing the‘Jews’ to return to England. I would stress again that we are not, in truth, talking aboutJews, but the financial hierarchy of the Black Nobility and the Brotherhood who hidebehind the term ‘Jews’ and mercilessly manipulate the mass of those who call themselvesJewish. After Cromwell’s death in 1661, many of his Calvinist-Puritan followers headedfor America to escape ‘religious persecution’ following the reinstatement of the monarchyunder Charles II. These were the religious fanatics who slaughtered the Native Americansunder the banner of ‘God’. The Black Nobility bankers in Amsterdam caused a financialdepression in England to undermine Charles II. Eventually a ‘peace’ deal was struckbetween Holland and England in 1667 in which William of Orange (Black Nobility)would marry Mary, daughter of the Duke of York. When Charles II died in 1685, it wasthe Duke of York who became King James II. Now all the Brotherhood had to do wasremove him from the throne and their guy would be King of England. They began tobribe James II’s most influential aristocratic supporters and the first to bite was JohnChurchill, the reptilian Duke of Marlborough. The Commissioner of Public Accountsrevealed that Churchill had taken bribes totalling some £60,000 (an absolute fortune inthose days) from representatives of Dutch and Spanish financial families like Sir Solomonde Medina and Antonio Machado. Researcher, Euctace Mullins, puts it at more like£350,000.36John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough, was an ancestor of Britain’s wartime primeminister, Sir Winston Churchill, and the Churchill-Brotherhood connections continue tothis day. Sir Winston’s daughter-in-law, Pamela, married the American, Averell Harriman,one of the great Brotherhood manipulators of the 20th century and much documented in ..And The Truth Shall Set You Free. Pamela Harriman, who had formerly been married toWinston’s son, Randolph, became very influential in the American Democratic Party andis widely named as the force behind Bill Clinton’s election as US president. She wasrewarded by being made US ambassador to the key Brotherhood city of Paris, where she"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"172died in 1997 at the age of 76. Her son, also named Winston, is a British member ofParliament who is close to the Rothschilds. Pamela Churchill-Harriman dated Elie deRothschild before marrying Averell Harriman. In 1995 the Churchill family were given£12,500 million of National Lottery money when they sold some of Sir WinstonChurchill’s Second World War speeches to ‘the nation’. The speeches were purchasedwith this public money by the National Heritage Memorial Board, chaired by... LordJacob Rothschild. Just a coincidence, nothing to worry about. The Churchill-Harrimansare bloodline families. One of Pamela Harriman’s ancestors conspired with the Percyfamily, ancestors of George Bush, in the attempt to blow up the Houses of Parliament inthe so-called Gun Powder Plot led by Guy Fawkes on November 5th 1605. As aHarriman, Pamela represented the ‘Democratic’ wing of the Brotherhood while theBush’s, close associates and business partners of the Harrimans, represent the‘Republican’ wing. Both have answered to the same master to ensure that the UnitedStates, like every other country, is a one-party-state. The Bush family are close friendsof the Windsors, which shouldn’t surprise anyone who has read this far because bothare shape-shifting reptilians. Bush and his associate, the Brotherhood’s tireless globalmanipulator, Henry Kissinger, have both been knighted by Queen Elizabeth II.The modern version of Freemasonry expanded rapidly from its obscure beginningsamong the Templars and other mystery initiates. The Grand Lodge of England - thecentre of the network - was officially formed on June 24th 1717. This is St John theBaptist’s Day, a sacred day for the Knights Templar and an obvious connection to theKnights of St John of Jerusalem (Malta). John the Baptist is the patron saint of boththe Freemasons and the Templars because Oannes was another form of John inBabylon and Oannes was a another name for Nimrod. The Irish Grand Lodge followedsome six or seven years later. Most of the field lodges which emerged among theregiments in the British army were warranted by the Irish and not the English GrandLodge. The Scottish clans introduced Freemasonry to their blood brethren in Franceand I should mention one man in this regard, Andrew Michael Ramsey, a tutor to theScottish Stuart pretender to the throne, Bonnie Prince Charlie. Ramsey was born inScotland in the I 680s and was a close friend of Isaac Newton, the Grand Master of thePriory of Sion. He was a member of many Elite groupings, including a sort ofRosicrucian society called the Philadelphians (named after the city from where theAmerican War of Independence was orchestrated) and the French chivalric Order of StLazarus. Many of these Elite groups give their initiates esoteric names and Ramsey’sBrotherhood name was ‘Chevalier’.37 He was a significant factor in the spread ofFreemasonry and he is particularly remembered in Freemasonic circles for two versionsof the same speech he made in December 1736 and March 1737. It became known asRamsey’s Oration and in it he charted some of the history of Freemasonry. He confirmedthat it was derived from the mystery schools of antiquity which worshipped Diana,Minerva and Isis (Semiramis). He said that Freemasonry had its origins in the Holy Landat the time of the Crusades (the Knights Templar) and did not originate with stonemasons. Ramsey said that ‘our Order’ (the Templars) had formed an intimate union with"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"173the Knights of St John of Jerusalem (Malta) and from that time: “our lodges took thename of Lodges of St John”.38 In France, Freemasonry, with Ramsey’s keen support,spawned a particularly important strand, a fusion between Freemasonry and theJacobite movement which became known as Grand Orient Freemasonry. There are alsoGrand Orient networks in others countries like Brazil and Portugal. Grand Orient meansGrand East and its rituals are inspired by the worship of Zoroaster in Persia, Ishtar andTammuz (Semiramis and Nimrod) in Babylon, Demeter, Persephone and Dionysus inGreece, Aphrodite and Adonis in Syria, Isis and Osiris in Egypt, and Mithra in Persia.39The Grand Orient in France was to be the focus behind the manipulation andcoordination of the French Revolution. From the Brotherhood’s point of view, this‘peoples’ revolution had nothing to do with freedom and everything to do with itsAgenda for global control. The famous cry of the French revolutionaries: “Liberty,Equality, Fraternity”, is a Freemasonic motto.The science of manipulationAs the power of religion began to wane, another mental prison cell was created. We call it,rather bravely, ‘science’. Not real science. Official science, the one that says that this worldis all there is and there is no continuation of life after ‘death’. The Brotherhood had to findan alternative for those rejecting religion to ensure they would not realise that we aremultidimensional infinite consciousness incarnate in a physical body for a period ofintense experience on the road of evolution; that we don’t ‘die’ because we cannot die.Energy is consciousness and energy cannot be destroyed, only transformed into anotherexpression of itself. When you realise that you are not your physical body, but the infinite,eternal consciousness giving life to that body, your vision of yourself and your potential isexpanded beyond measure. What a nightmare for those who wish to exert control. Sothrough the Freemasonic networks, the Royal Society was formed, yet again in London,under a royal warrant from Charles II in 1662. It was the world’s first assembly ofscientists and engineers, and it was to be the dominating influence on the direction of‘science’. Virtually all the early members of the Royal Society were Freemasons who knewthat that direction was flawed and untrue. No doubt the same applies today. Some familiarnames are about to appear again. The ‘father’ of the Royal Society, who was said to be itsinspiration before he ‘died’ (or moved locations), was Francis Bacon, the top Rosicrucian,translator of the Bible, and architect of Freemasonry. The Royal Society stalwarts alsoincluded: Isaac Newton, the Rosicrucian Grand Master of the Priory of Sion, who becamea fellow in 1672; Lord Moray, a Scottish Freemason; Elias Ashmole, one of the firstregistered Freemasons; and Andrew Michael ‘Chevalier’ Ramsey, a leading light ofFreemasonry, who was admitted to the Royal Society without any scientific qualificationswhatsoever. Another fellow was John Byrom, a Freemason and member of the CabalaClub, also known as the Sun Club.40 In 1984, more than 500 of his papers were found in ahouse in Manchester and they included information about sacred geometry, architectureand cabalistic, Freemasonic and other alchemical and esoteric symbols.41Ashmole, an alchemist and Rosicrucian with many esoteric contacts in Germany,"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"174was a close friend of Charles II and a Knight of the Order of the Garter, that premierorder of ‘chivalry’ headed by the monarch. He wrote a book with Arthur Dee (the son ofDr John Dee), who was personal physician to the Tsar, Ivan the Terrible. When Ivandied, Dee’s manipulation installed the Romanov dynasty on the Russian throne.42Ashmole was extremely well connected and maintained close contacts with the‘Invisible College’ which met in Oxford from 1650. Just such a group was proposed byFrancis Bacon in his book, The New Atlantis. This ‘Invisible College’ included thefamed scientist Robert Boyle, another Grand Master of the Priory of Sion, and SirChristopher Wren, the architect behind St Paul’s Cathedral in the City of London, thefinancial centre of the Black Nobility and the Babylonian Brotherhood. Both wereGrand Masters of the Rosicrucian Order. St Paul’s, and the rebuilding of the City ingeneral, was made possible by the Great Fire of London in 1666 and how interestingthat both Wren, the architect who designed St Paul’s Cathedral on a former site of Dianaworship, and Robert Hooke, one of three city surveyors after the fire, were bothmembers of the Royal Society and high initiates of the secret societies. The new City ofLondon was built to a Masonic street plan with the design of the buildings based on theknowledge of the energy grid in that area and how best to manipulate it.The Royal Society was - and is - more than a grouping of scientists. At its core it is asecret society controlled, indeed created, by the Brotherhood to limit the vision andbreadth of scientific and spiritual understanding. For confirmation of that, look at theesoteric initiates behind an organisation which denies the esoteric. This becomes evenmore obvious when you consider the background of another group of esoteric initiateswho merged into the Royal Society. They called themselves the Lunar Society becausethey met once a month on the night of the full Moon.43 Among its members wasBenjamin Franklin, the high level Freemason, Rosicrucian, one of the Founding Fathersof the United States, and closely connected to the Freemasons behind the FrenchRevolution. More of him in the next chapter. Other Lunar Society members wereErasmus Darwin, the grandfather of Charles Darwin, the man who would be used topromote the belief in this world-is-all-there-is science and the survival of the fittest vianatural selection. I don’t think that even Darwin believed that, certainly not at the endof his life, but the image, the myth, has prevailed. Anyway, the idea that Charles Darwin‘discovered’ the theory of natural selection and survival of the fittest is ridiculous. Hisgrandfather, Erasmus of the Lunar Society, wrote a book called Zoonomia in 1794 inwhich he outlined the very same opinion.44 Josiah Wedgwood of the Wedgwood potteryempire, was another Lunar Society member and his daughter married Erasmus Darwin’sson, Robert Darwin, and became the mother of Charles Darwin! 45 This same bloodlineproduced Thomas Malthus, who’s sickening racist creed has been used by Adolf Hitler,Henry Kissinger and endless other frontmen for the Brotherhood to justify the genocideof ‘lesser’ races to maintain the genetic purity of the human blood stock - the reptileAryans.46 Malthus, an Anglican clergyman, said that disease and appalling livingconditions for the masses were essential to stop over-population and the dilution of themaster (white) bloodlines. This is just one of his little gems of wisdom:"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"175“We are bound in justice and honour formally to disclaim the right of the poor to support. Tothis end, I should propose a regulation to be made declaring that no child born... shouldever be entitled to parish assistance... The (illegitimate) infant is, comparatively speaking,of little value to society, as others will immediately supply its place... All children beyondwhat would be required to keep up the population to this (desired) level, must necessarilyperish, unless room be made for them by the deaths of grown persons.”47The economist, John Maynard Keynes, who’s principles have dominated moderneconomic policy, thought Malthus to be a genius and Darwin and his circle believed himto be a master of logic.48 The population control policies of this century have beeninspired by the genocide principles of Malthus, as I expose in .. .And The Truth Shall SetYou Free. Again the Scottish connection appears. Six of the members of the LunarSociety were educated in Edinburgh and so was Charles Darwin. Another major voice inthe official dismantling of ‘God’ and the denial of the eternal soul, was the Frenchman,Rene Descartes, born in 1596 and called: “the father of modern philosophy” .49Descartes was educated by the Roman Catholic branch of the Babylonian Brotherhood,the Jesuits. He called himself a Roman Catholic all his life and yet his books were placedon the Catholic Index of Forbidden Books. His views would later be expounded by IsaacNewton. Both of them were fascinated by the esoteric and alchemy. Here we can see thatthe same force which created the religions of the ancient world, also designed the new‘science’. Who created and sold the idea of a judgmental God and paradise only forbelievers? The very people who knew it wasn’t true. Who created the materialist and‘cosmic accident’ version of ‘science’ that denies the eternal soul? The very people whoknew it wasn’t true. This tradition is continued today by the movement known asHumanism. Its manifesto, published in 1953, says that the universe is self existing andnot created; modern science offers the only acceptable definition of the universe andhuman values; and when you die you cease to exist.These two apparent opposites, religion and science, have many things in common,but one in particular. They both deny the true nature of who we are and the power wehave within ourselves to control our destiny. Once we realise that and grasp thelimitless power that is waiting to be tapped, the control of the reptilians and theirbloodlines will be no more. The face of the Babylonian Brotherhood has endlessinterconnected masks, but the creation of Freemasonry provided a network which couldact as a global coordinator for the thousands of these ‘masks’ to communicate with eachother. Some of the masks operate within one group or area of society, but most,especially the major ones like Freemasonry, operate within organisations and groupswhich appear on the surface to be opposed to each other. This has been a means for thesame ‘mask’ to manipulate conflicts and wars, and to direct science, politics andreligion to advance the Agenda.The structure was now in place to press the button on the next stage of the plan.

But the United States has always beencontrolled from London and still is. America has never been the land of the free and it’stime it was.The focus of the world has been on big, bad America, as the global villain while allthe time the events blamed on Americans have been orchestrated by the Elite of theBabylonian Brotherhood in England and elsewhere. The apparent break up of theBritish Empire and Britain’s decline, on the surface, as the super power, has furtherobscured, on purpose, where the real power lies. I emphasise that by London I do notmean the British Government which is just another facade no matter who is in office. Imean that for historical and other reasons the major operational centre of the secretsociety web of the reptile Brotherhood is based in London or New Troy and, to a largeextent, Paris, Brussels and Rome, also. Once again, to understand what has happened inthe United States we have to go back a very long time. The Phoenicians landed there inancient times and what appeared to be Egyptian (Phoenician) or Oriental remains werefound in the Grand Canyon in the early years of this century, although the knowledge ofthis has been suppressed. The naming of the US city of Phoenix in the Valley of the Sunin Arizona was inspired by an understanding of the true history of that area, no matterwhat the official version may wish us to believe. There is evidence that the Welsh, Irish,English and Scots landed in North America many centuries before Columbus.The official story that Christopher Columbus discovered the Americas isludicrous. A few miles from Edinburgh in Scotland today still stands RosslynChapel, that holy grail of the Brotherhood Elite. It was built in the shape of aTemplar cross by the St Clair-Sinclair family and is a mass of esoteric symbolism.The foundations were laid in 1446 and it was completed in the 1480s. Howremarkable then that the stonework at Rosslyn includes depictions of sweetcorn andcacti which were only found in America and Christopher Columbus did not‘discover’ that continent until 1492! How could this be? There is, in fact, no mystery.Christopher Columbus was not even nearly the first white person to land in theAmericas. The Phoenicians, Norse, Irish, Welsh, Bretons, Basques and Portuguese,all sailed to America before him and so did Prince Henry Sinclair of Rosslyn, asdocumented in a rare book by Frederick I. Pohl called Prince Henry Sinclair’sVoyage To The New World 1398. Sinclair made the journey with another Brotherhood"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"179bloodline, the Zeno family, one of the most prominent Black Nobility families inVenice. Sinclair and Antonio Zeno landed in what we call Newfoundland and wentashore in Nova Scotia (New Scotland) in 1398. Antonio’s descriptions in his letters ofthe land they found correspond perfectly, and in detail, with an area of pitch (asphalt)deposits in Pictou County, Nova Scotia, not far from the present town of New Glasgow.Sinclair went on to land in what is now New England. In Massachusetts at a placecalled Prospect Hill at Westford, 25 miles from Boston, a representation of a sword andan armoured knight have been found in the rock. T. C. Lethbridge, the curator of theUniversity Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Cambridge, England, said thatthe arms, armour and heraldic emblems were those of a late 14th century knight, northScottish, and: “a kin to the first Sinclair Earl of Orkney”.1 The Brotherhood had knownabout the Americas for thousands of years and Christopher Columbus was used to makethe official discovery so that the occupation of the Americas could begin. This is thestory of how it was done.After the purge of 1307, many Templars left France for Scotland, as we have seen. Butothers headed for Portugal where they operated under the name, the Knights of Christ,focusing mainly on maritime activities. The most famous Grand Master of the Knights ofChrist was Prince Henry the Navigator (another Prince Henry) who lived between 1394and 1460. The term ‘navigator’ or ‘nautier’ was used by the Knights Templar and thePriory of Sion to denote a Grand Master and so not surprisingly it was continued by thisTemplar front, the Knights of Christ. Prince Henry was a maritime explorer of royal bloodand it was his sailors who ‘discovered’ Madeira and the Azores, two possible remnants ofAtlantis. Because of his connections to the secret Brotherhood knowledge, he had accessto many maps compiled from the journeys of the Phoenicians and others, including thosewhich charted the existence of the Americas. Only a little over 20 years after Columbusset sail for the Americas, sorry ‘India’, the Ottoman Turkish Admiral, Pin Reis, drew amap of what the land mass of Antarctica looked like 300 years before that continent wasofficially discovered! The accuracy of his map has been confirmed by modern techniques.How could he do that? He said he drew the map from earlier ones, the same sourcesavailable to Prince Henry the Navigator and the Knights of Christ -Knights Templar. Thisbecomes extremely important when you realise that one of Prince Henry’s sea captainsand a Knight of Christ was the father-in-law of... Christopher Columbus. This guy wasnot looking for India. He knew where he was going all along. This is why so manymaritime explorers and circumnavigators of the world, like Vasco de Gama and AmerigoVespucci, came from Portugal. As the Freemasonic historian, Manly P. Hall, hasexplained, Columbus was connected to the secret society network in Genoa and northernItaly, the bastion of the Black Nobility Venetian-Phoenicians and the reptilian crossbreeds.He was at one time employed by Rene d’Anjou of the reptilian House of Lorraine, amember of the Babylonian Brotherhood and a nobleman with endless contacts acrossEurope, including Genoa and Venice. Columbus (real name Colon) was a member of agroup inspired by the beliefs of the poet, Dante, who was a very active Cathar andTemplar and the flag Columbus flew on his ships on that journey to the Americas was..."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"180the red cross on the white background. Crucial support for Columbus came from twohigh initiates of the Babylon Brotherhood network, Lorenzo de Medici, one of the mostpowerful Venetian reptilian families, and the artist Leonardo da Vinci, a Grand Masterof the Priory of Sion.Five years after Columbus landed in the Caribbean, an Italian known as John Cabotset sail from the Templar port of Bristol in the west of England to officially discoverNewfoundland, Nova Scotia, and North America. The name Bristol evolved from Baratiand was once called Caer Brito. Bristol was a centre for the Knights Templar and thearea of the city today called Temple Meads relates to that. Cabot was backed byEngland’s Henry VII and Cabot’s son, Sebastian, born in Venice, was an explorer andmap maker for Henry. Sebastian also sailed to the Hudson Bay in Canada and led anexpedition for the Spanish to South America. The Cabots said they were looking forAsia! The expeditions of the Spanish to South America and the British and French toNorth America were all coordinated by the same source, branches of the Brotherhood.Official history does not connect Cabot with Columbus, but not through lack ofevidence. John Cabot’s real name was Giovanni Caboto. He was a naturalised Venetianwho came from Genoa - the very city where Columbus operated from at the same timeCabot was there. Manly P. Hall, a high degree Freemason himself, said that both wereconnected to the same secret societies and ‘Wise Men of the East’. He adds in his book,America’s Assignment With Destiny:“The explorers who opened the New World operated from a master plan and were agentsof re-discovery rather than discoverers. Very little is known about the origin, lives,characters, and policies of these intrepid adventurers. Although they lived in a centuryamply provided with historians and biographers, these saw fit either to remain silent or toinvent plausible accounts without substance.”2Of course they did. They didn’t want the people to know the truth that it was all a scamand part of the long term Brotherhood Agenda. Over the next four centuries theBrotherhood-controlled countries of Europe, particularly Britain, but also including theDutch, French, Belgians, Spanish, Portuguese, Germans and others, plundered the planet,taking over the world, in effect, and expanded the reptile-Aryan control as never before.Typical of the mentality and the methods employed were those of Hernando Cortes, wholed the Spanish takeover of Central America after Columbus. The native peoples had theirown system of measuring time and they had a date on which they expected the return oftheir god, Quetzalcoatl, in many ways their version of Jesus. The stories told about Jesusin the Middle East and Europe and those of Quetzalcoatl in Central America werebasically the same because they came from the same source. The date of the expectedsecond coming of the white god, Quetzalcoatl, was, in European time, 1519 and theybelieved that he would be wearing attire in keeping with his nickname of the PlumedSerpent. Cortes went ashore in Mexico in 1519 wearing plumed feathers and he evenlanded close to the spot where Quetzacoatl was expected. He was also carrying a cross,"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"181again in keeping with the Quetzalcoatl legend. Because of this, the Aztec king,Montezuma, believed, like his people, that Cortes was the long awaited return of theirgod. This allowed Cortes, with only 598 men, to gain control of a vast number of people.By the time they realised that Cortes was no second coming, it was too late. Enormousslaughter of the native peoples followed and one Spanish historian estimated at least 12million natives of South America alone were killed after the Europeans (Aryans andreptile-Aryans) arrived and an even greater number became slaves. Among the Spanishconquests were the lands of the Incas and the Maya and much of their knowledge waslost or systematically destroyed. The same happened in North America where theEuropeans killed untold numbers of Native Americans and virtually wiped that culturefrom the face of the Earth. The native peoples of Africa, Australia, New Zealand, andelsewhere suffered a similar fate. The Aryans, unknowingly controlled by the reptile-Aryans, took over the world through these British and European empires and whereverthey went the knowledge of life and history (ie, the reptilian involvement in humanaffairs) was stolen or destroyed. One of the most obvious earlier examples of this was thedestruction of the great esoteric library at Alexandria in Egypt on the orders of theRomans in the 4th century Books that were not destroyed were hoarded in the Vatican.The contact who has relatives working at high levels in the Vatican told me how, duringhis guided tour of the place, he saw vacuum-sealed vaults under the building whichhoused thousands of ancient esoteric books. “It was unbelievable”, he said.The first permanent English settlement in what became the United States was atJamestown, Virginia, in the early 17th century. Virginia, it is said, was named afterElizabeth I, the completely misnamed ‘virgin queen’. It is far more likely, however, giventhe background, that it was named after the virgin goddess of ancient Babylon, QueenSemiramis and her mirror in Egypt, Isis. Many members of the Francis Bacon familywere among the early settlers and so were the Puritan-Calvinists in their black clothingand tall hats who treated the native population, like their own women, with an arroganceand inhumanity beyond description. With the settlers, as the Brotherhood expanded theiroccupation of the planet, came the reptilian bloodlines of the European aristocracy androyalty who would become the business leaders, bankers, presidents and administrators ofthe new United States. The financial and land ownership of America was assured from thestart with the formation of the Virginia Company, set up by King James I in 1606. Jamesknighted Francis Bacon and appointed him to many important positions, including LordChancellor of England. Under James’s patronage, the Templars, Rosicrucians and othersecret societies joined forces under one name, Freemasonry. Look at some of the earlymembers of the Virginia Company - Francis Bacon, Earl of Pembroke, Earl ofMontgomery, Earl of Salisbury, Earl of Northampton, and Lord Southampton. All of themof Brotherhood bloodlines. The Virginia Company still exists under other names and itstill controls the United States, as I shall explain in a moment.The Freemasons were at the forefront of the change from overt to covert rule byBritain of the North American continent. This transition is known by history as theAmerican War of Independence. The Brotherhood Agenda for America was"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"182encapsulated in Francis Bacon’s work, The New Atlantis, published in 1607, in which an‘Invisible College’ of elite intellectuals dictated events. One of the leading Freemasonsof the British colonies in America was Benjamin Franklin, who is still revered as aFounding Father who believed in freedom for the people. His face can be seen on the$100 note. Even the Christian patriot movement which has understood many elements ofthe global conspiracy, has bought the idea that Franklin would have been on their side. Ibeg, most strongly, to disagree. Franklin was an asset of British Intelligence, a Satanist,stalwart of the Babylonian Brotherhood, and sacrificer of children. If Americans are notto lose the plot here they need to take a whole new look at the background andmotivations of many of their Founding Fathers. Franklin was the Henry Kissinger of hisday. It was Franklin who, on December 8th 1730, printed the first documented articleabout Freemasonry in his newspaper, The Pennsylvania Gazette. He officially became aFreemason in February 1731, and was made Provincial Grand Master of Pennsylvania in1734. In the same year Franklin printed the first Masonic book in America and the firstrecorded American lodge was founded in his province in Philadelphia. Where was theAmerican War of ‘Independence’ orchestrated from? Philadelphia and there you will stillfind the Liberty Bell - symbol of Bel, the Sun god of the Phoenicians and the Aryans.The Phoenician language is about sound, not spelling, and integral to the secret,symbolic language of the reptile-Aryans is the sound of a word. Franklin, who was also aRosicrucian Grand Mastei, was at the heart of the Brotherhood operation to take overAmerica and replace overt control from London with covert control, the most effectiveand ongoing form of ruling the masses. I would urge those who think that people likeFranklin and many other Founding Fathers were believers in freedom, not to be dupedhere. If I want you to give me power and support me at an election, am I going to tellyou what you want to hear or what I know you don’t want to hear? Many of the mainFounding Fathers, like Franklin and Jefferson, were obvious hypocrites who said onething and did quite another. This is something, of course, that everyone does from timeto time, but we are talking scale here. Jefferson wrote that all men are created equalwhile keeping 200 black slaves and writing elsewhere that black people are geneticallyand intellectually inferior to whites. How do you square those statements? You can’t.Franklin, too, kept black slaves while parroting on about freedom.Franklin was the leading Freemason in the very place where the War ofIndependence was organised; he was a member of Freemasonic networks in France,like the Nine Sisters and the San Juan Lodges, which helped to manipulate the FrenchRevolution in 1789; he was an initiate of the highly exclusive Royal Lodge ofCommanders of the Temple West of Carcassonne; he was also a member of the SatanicHellfire Club with his close friend, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir FrancisDashwood, who was linked to many esoteric groups, including the Druid UniversalBond. Dashwood had a huge cave dug at his West Wycombe (Wicca) estate for theirSatanic rituals and sexual ‘magic’ ceremonies.3 I will discuss the reasons behind theobsession with sex ritual in a later chapter. Let me stress again here that I am notcondemning all Druids or the Wiccan traditions, not at all. I am pointing out the"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"183malevolent use of this knowledge, which can, and is, used very positively and lovinglyalso by people who call themselves Druids and Wiccan. The reason I mention that peoplewere Druids etc, is to confirm that they understood and worked with the esotericknowledge while condemning it in public and hiding behind Christianity. AnotherHellfire Club member at this time was Frederick, the Prince of Wales, and so were thePrime Minister, the First Lord of the Admiralty, and the Mayor of the City of London.4This was the company kept by Benjamin Franklin, the man who would lead a ‘rebellion’against the same British Crown! In truth he was agent 72 of British Intelligence, the verysame organisation created by people like Francis Bacon and Dr John Dee during thereign of Elizabeth I. In 1998 excavations under Franklin’s former home at 36 CravenStreet, near Trafalgar Square in London, found the remains of ten bodies, six of themchildren, and they have been dated to the time that Franklin lived there. The cover storyappears to be that he and his house mate must have been into grave robbing or buyingbodies for medical research. Given that Franklin was a member of a group involved inritual sacrifice, in line with the ancient rituals of the Babylonian Brotherhood, doesanyone seriously believe that? Oh yes, one other thing. It was these two Satanists,Benjamin Franklin and Sir Francis Dashwood, who produced a prayer book whichbecame the basis for the Christian Book of Common Prayer! As Dashwood was alsoknown as Lord le DeSpencer, their work became known as the Franklin-DeSpencerPrayer Book and, in the United States, it was the Franklin Prayer Book.5 Franklin wasworking in both America and Europe for the Brotherhood Agenda as were otherFounding Fathers, and it is no accident that both Franklin and Jefferson were appointedat different times to represent American interests in that key centre, Paris, as was SirFrancis Bacon as a ‘British’ representative. It was Franklin’s close contacts with thesecret society network in France which led to so many French revolutionaries andFreemasons, like Lafayette, being involved in the American War of Independence. Hisunderground contacts also secured the services of the German Freemason, Baron vonStreube, who served in the army of Frederick of Prussia. Streube played a significant rolein the war, as, of course, did the high degree Freemason, George Washington, the head ofthe American forces, and the first President of the United States. Most of his officerswere Freemasons, as were the leaders and many of the troops in the British armies.Lord Geoffrey Amherst was Commander-in-Chief of British forces in the War ofIndependence and the man who paid for his commission to become an officer in thefirst place, was Lionel Sackville, the first Duke of Dorset, an associate of the Dukeof Wharton. In 1741, Sackville and Wharton became Knights of the Garter, the Elitechivalric order of the British monarch which slots into the other ‘knights’ networkslike the Knights of St John of Jerusalem (Malta). The symbol of the Knights of theGarter is a red cross on a white shield. Sackville founded the Grand Orient networkof Freemasonry in Italy which worked with the highly secretive Carbonari and theAlta Vendita. His sons, George and Charles the Earl of Middlesex, were both veryactive Freemasons. Charles Sackville formed a lodge in the Black Nobilitystronghold of Florence, Italy in 1733 and he cofounded the Dilettanti Society with"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"184Benjamin Franklin’s friend, Sir Francis Dashwood. Charles Sackville and Dashwoodwere members of an Elite group of Freemasons around Frederick, Prince of Wales, amember of the Hellfire Club. Charles’ younger brother, George, became colonel of the20th Foot Regiment (later the Lancashire Fusiliers) and Master of their Freemasonicfield lodge. One of the wardens in this lodge was Lieutenant Colonel EdwardCornwallis, another of the top British Army commanders in the war with the Americancolonies. Cornwallis, who’s twin brother was Archbishop of Canterbury, was madeGovernor of Nova Scotia in 1750 and formed a Freemasons lodge there. Serving underCornwallis was Captain James Wolf, yet another figure who would play a vital role forthe British in the War of Independence. In 1751, George Sackville became GrandMaster of the Irish Grand Lodge, the very body to which the field lodges of the BritishArmy in the colonies were affiliated. And in 1775, just as the war in America wasgetting into full swing, this same George Sackville, a close friend of the BlackNobility’s King George III, was appointed Colonial Secretary in charge of the Americancolonies! This was the same network to which Benjamin Franklin was connected. Inshort, the Babylonian Brotherhood, via the Freemasons, controlled and manipulatedboth sides in the American War of Independence, just as they do in every other war.As historians have documented, the British military and naval operation during theWar of Independence was incredibly inept. It wasn’t that the colonies won the war, itwas that the British chose to lose it. Now we can see why, and the channels throughwhich this was made possible. Also, the British regiments were awash withFreemasonic field lodges which interlocked with their brethren in the American Army.Benjamin Franklin based himself in Paris during the crucial period and from there hecould communicate easily with the French lodges and the British. Paris was also amajor centre, and still is, for the British spy network. The role of British PostmasterGeneral was traditionally one of espionage, not least because you had control of allcommunications. Britain split the job between two people, Sir Francis Dashwood,Franklin’s fellow Satanist, and the Earl of Sandwich who, with Dashwood, formed yetanother secret society called the Order of St Francis. This was another Hellfire Club.The Earl of Sandwich was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty in charge of the navalwar against the American colonies and the Encyclopaedia Britannica says that forcorruption and incapacity, the administration of the Earl of Sandwich was unique in thehistory of the British Navy. Equally inept (on purpose) was the commander of navaloperations, Admiral Lord Richard Howe, who had been brought together with Franklinin 1774 by Franklin’s sister, a member of his spy network who lived in England. Howelater admitted publicly that he had not told his superiors of his meetings with Franklin.In the three or four years leading up to the American Declaration of Independence in1776, Franklin spent the summer at Dashwood’s estate in West Wycombe, north ofLondon, where they took part in ‘rituals’ in the specially-created caves dug onDashwood’s orders to provide the appropriate locations for their Satanism. A statue ofHarpocrates, the Greek god of secrecy and silence, was to be found on the premises ofthe Hellfire Club depicted with a finger held to his mouth.6 Statues of Harpocrates were"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"185often found at the entrances to temples, caves and other sites where the mysteries wereperformed and communicated. It was Dashwood and Franklin, himself a deputyPostmaster General for the Colonies, who coordinated the war from both sides to ensurethe outcome - the covert control of the new United States by the BabylonianBrotherhood in London. A letter dated June 3rd 1778, written by John Norris, an agentof Dashwood, says that he: “Did this day Heliograph intelligence from Doctor Franklinin Paris to Wycombe.”7The American War of Independence broke out officially in 1775, triggered by theimposition by the British Crown of higher taxation on the colonies to meet the hugecosts of the Seven Years War between Britain and France, another Brotherhood-manipulated conflict. The Seven Years War itself began after George Washington, then ayoung military leader in the British Colonial Army, had apparently ordered the killing ofFrench troops in Ohio. The seeds of revolution in America were sown when theBrotherhood in London ensured that new taxes were introduced and their representativesin the colonies began to stimulate the rebellion against them. This is a classic techniqueused throughout the ages. The mass of the people stood in the middle with no idea ofwhat was going on, taking everything on face value. Among the American ‘rebels’ werethe Freemasons, Patrick Henry and Richard Henry Lee, who led a rebellion by theVirginia Assembly in 1769. The situation came to a head with the passing of the Tea Actwhich allowed that Brotherhood operation, the British East India Company, to unload itssurplus tea in the colonies without paying duty. This clearly destroyed the market foreveryone else. Official history to this day says that a group of Mohawk Indians boardeda ship called the Dartmouth in Boston Harbour and threw its cargo of tea into the water.This was dubbed: the Boston Tea Party. In fact the ‘rebels’ were not Mohawk Indians,but members of the St Andrew’s Freemasons Lodge in Boston dressed up as Indians.They were led by their junior warden, Paul Revere. This event could not have happenedwithout support from the British-controlled Colonial Militia who had been detailed toguard the Dartmouth. The captain of one detachment, Edward Proctor, was a memberof... the St Andrew’s Lodge. This lodge was the first in the world to confer a newFreemasonic degree called the Knights Templar Degree. The Grand Master, JosephWarren, was appointed Grand Master of the whole of North America by the GrandLodge of Scotland. Other members of the St Andrew’s Lodge included John Hancock.He would be a leader of the so-called Continental Congress who signed the Declarationof Independence. At least three members of the St Andrew’s Lodge, including PaulRevere, were members of the ‘loyal nine’, the inner elite of an important revolutionarygroup called the Sons of Liberty. It was this group which organised the Boston Tea Party.Much of this information is documented by the Freemasonic historian, Manly P.Hall, who also points out that of the 56 signatories of the American Declaration ofIndependence, almost 50 were known Freemasons and only one was definitelyknown not to be. On September 3rd 1783, the colonies were recognised as anindependent republic, the United States, in the appropriately named, Treaty ofParis. The new constitution was primarily produced by George Washington,"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"186Benjamin Franklin, Edmund Randolph, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams, at leastofficially. Most of the Founding Fathers who were so committed to freedom were, likeFranklin and Jefferson, keen owners of slaves. Franklin owned slaves for 30 years andsold them at his general store. He placed an advertisement for a slave in 1733 whichread: “A likely wench about 15 years old, has had the smallpox, been in the countryabove a year, and talks English. Inquire the printer hereof.” George Washington ownedslaves as did other big names in the War of Independence like John Hancock and PatrickHenry. It was Henry who said: “Give me liberty or give me death.” Unless your face isblack, that is. In all, nine presidents were slave owners and one, Andrew Johnson, placedan advertisement seeking the recapture of a runaway slave and offering an extra tendollars for every 100 lashes the captor gave the slave. Edmund Randolph, a closeassociate and aide to George Washington, and later Grand Master of the Grand Lodge ofVirginia, was appointed the first Attorney General and Secretary of State of the UnitedStates. It was Randolph who proposed a system of central government based on thestructure long proposed by the ‘Invisible College’ and the Francis Bacon network.Most Americans believe the Constitution was compiled to ensure freedom, but it wascarefully worded to create loopholes through which the Brotherhood Agenda could beridden. For a start it says that if the President vetoes a bill passed by Congress thelegislation goes back to the House of Representatives and the Senate and to override thepresidential veto it has to be voted through again by a majority of at least two-thirds inboth houses. This means that you only have to control the President and one third of onehouse and you stop any legislation becoming law. What more powerful weapon could youhave within a ‘free’ society to defend your status quo and stop challenges to your power?Patriots believe that the creation of money by the private banks is unconstitutional in theUnited States because the Constitution says that Congress must create the currency. But itdoesn’t say that. Article One, Section 8, says that: “Congress shall have the power to coinmoney and regulate the value thereof.” It does not say (on purpose) that only Congressshall have that power, nor that they have to use that power. Section 10 says that no Stateshall coin money and that gold and silver coins shall be the only payment of debts. Sopaper money must be unconstitutional? No. An area of Maryland was given to the newCongress to create the District, not the State, of Columbia for the new federal capitalcalled Washington DC. Within this district is the privately-owned central bank ofAmerica, the Federal Reserve, which issues the nations paper currency. The District ofColumbia is effectively isolated from many of clauses in the Constitution which apply tothe States. The main Founding Fathers would have known that.The first President was George Washington who sat in a chair with a rising Suncarved into the back, an ancient symbol of the Aryan Sun religion. He was GrandMaster of the Freemasons Lodge at Alexandria (named after its Egyptian namesake)near Washington DC. When he was inaugurated as President on April 30th 1789, theday before the major Brotherhood ritual day, May 1st or May Day, the oath was takenby Robert Livingstone, the Grand Master of the New York Grand Lodge. The ceremonywas entirely Freemasonic ritual carried out by Freemasons. A Grand Procession"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"187included Washington and the officers and initiates of American lodges in their regalia.Like most of the leading Founding Fathers, Washington was from an Englisharistocratic bloodline and one of his ancestors was an English knight of the 12thcentury, the time the Templars were formed, and another was a relative of the Duke ofBuckingham who had fought for the Crown in the English Civil War. Washington wasonly the first example of how the Babylonian Brotherhood based in Britain has used itsreptilian bloodlines to rule the United States from that day to this. Look at thegenealogy of American presidents, leading politicians, banking and business tycoons,military leaders, media owners, government officials, intelligence agency chiefs, etc,etc, and you will find they come from the same bloodlines which can be charted back tothe British and European royal and aristocratic (reptile-Aryan) families and their originsin the Middle and Near East at the time of Sumer and Babylon. Two examples: At least33 of the first 42 presidents of the United States have been related to England’s KingAlfred the Great (849-899) and Charlemagne (742-814), the famous monarch of France,and 19 Presidents are related to England’s King Edward 111(1312-1377), who has athousand blood connections to Prince Charles. George Bush and Barbara Bush are bothfrom the same British aristocratic line, among others. They come from the Piercebloodline, which changed its name from Percy after fleeing England in the wake of theGunpowder Plot to blow up the English parliament. The Bushes married for genetics, asthe Eastern Establishment families in the States always have done in line with theirfellow reptilian royal and aristocratic blood relatives in Europe. Even Bill Clinton andBob Dole, who ‘opposed’ each other at the 1996 Presidential election, are distantcousins. They can trace their ancestry to England’s King Henry III, who reigned from1227 to 1273 during the years of Templar pre-eminence, and US Presidents, WilliamHenry Harrison and Benjamin Harrison. This information comes from the publication,Burkes Peerage, which traces the lineage of royal and aristocratic families. Clinton hasfar more royal blood than Dole and is directly descended from the same bloodline as theHouse of Windsor, every Scottish monarch, and King Robert I of France. This is whyhe was the Brotherhood’s choice. Harold Brooks-Baker, the publishing director ofBurkes Peerage, said: “The presidential candidate with the greatest number of royalgenes has always been the victor, without exception, since George Washington”. Whatan astonishing statistic and ‘royal’ genes = reptilian genes. The same tribe whichcontrolled Europe simply expanded into the Americas and called it freedom. The UnitedStates has never been free of control from London. Indeed, it was the creation ofLondon. Britain and the British Crown has always owned, yes owned, the UnitedStates. If you are American and you have not heard this information before, and fewhave, it might be advisable to sit down quietly and have a cup of sweet tea because youare in for quite a shock.In 1604, a group of leading politicians, businessmen, merchants, manufacturers andbankers, met in Greenwich, then in the English county of Kent, and formed acorporation called the Virginia Company in anticipation of the imminent influx of whiteEuropeans, mostly British at first, into the North American continent. Its main"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"188stockholder was the reptilian, King James I, and the original charter for the companywas completed by April 10th 1606. This and later updates to the charter established thefollowing:•The Virginia Company comprised of two branches, the London Company and thePlymouth or New England Company. The former was responsible for the firstpermanent colony in America at Jamestown on May 14th 1607 and the latter werethe so-called ‘Pilgrim Fathers’ who arrived at Cape Cod in the ship the Mayflower,in November 1620, and went on to land in Plymouth Harbour on December 21st.The ‘Pilgrims’ of American historical myth were, in fact, members of the secondVirginia Company branch called the New England Company•The Virginia Company owned most of the land of what we now call the USA, andany lands up to 900 miles offshore. This included Bermuda and most of what is nowknown as the Caribbean Islands. The Virginia Company (the British Crown and thebloodline families) had rights to 50%, yes 50%, of the ore of all gold and silvermined on its lands, plus percentages of other minerals and raw materials, and 5% ofall profits from other ventures. These rights, the charters detailed, were to be passedon to all heirs of the owners of the Virginia Company and therefore continue toapply... forever! The controlling members of the Virginia Company who were toenjoy these rights became known as the Treasurer and Company of Adventurers andPlanters of the City of London.•After the first 21 years from the formation of the Virginia Company, all ‘duties,imposts, and excises’ paid on trading activities in the colonies had to be paid directlyto the British Crown through the Crown treasurer. No trader could export goods outof the colonies without the permission of the British Crown and to do so wouldinvolve the seizure of all their goods and the ship or vehicle which carried them.•The lands of the Virginia Company were granted to the colonies under a Deed ofTrust (on lease) and therefore they could not claim ownership of the land. Theycould pass on the perpetual use of the land to their heirs or sell the perpetual use, butthey could never own it. Ownership was retained by the British Crown.•The colonial lands were to be governed by two Colonial Councils, each with 13members (that number again), but the Kings Council in London had the final say onall decisions. The sitting British monarch also chose the Governor of the AmericanColonies, who we would today call the President.•The monarch, through his Council for the Colonies, insisted that members of thecolonies impose the Christian religion on all the people, including the NativeAmericans. To use the language of the time... “with all diligence, care and respect,do provide that the true word of God and Christian faith be preached, planted andused, not only within every of the several said colonies and plantations, but also asmuch as they may amongst the savage people which do or shall adjoin us to them orborder upon them, according to the doctrine, rights, and religion, now professed andestablished within our realm of England.” If the Native Americans did not accept the"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"189Christian religion, they would have to be forced to, the Crown insisted. This was theorder to destroy the culture and knowledge of the native peoples of North Americaand also to maintain the white colonists under the vicious yoke of Christianterrorism peddled by the Calvinist-Puritans. It was a free licence to kill, torture andkidnap the native peoples with complete immunity from prosecution.•The criminal courts on the lands of the Virginia Company were to be operated underAdmiralty Law, the law of the sea, and the civil courts under common law, the lawof the land. This is a crucial point which I will come to in a second.Now, get this. All of the above still applies today! Read those percentages once moreand let the magnitude of that sink in. After the original 13 (again!) American colonieswon their ‘independence’ and an ‘independent’ country was formed after 1783, theVirginia Company simply changed its name to... the United States of America. You seethere are two USAs, or rather a USA and a usA. The united states of America with alower case ‘u’ and ‘5’ are the lands of the various states. These lands, as we have seen,are still owned by the British Crown as the head of the old Virginia Company, althoughthere is something to add about this in a moment. Then there is the United States ofAmerica, capital ‘U’ and ‘S’, which is the 68 square miles of land west of the PotomacRiver on which is built the federal capital, Washington DC and the District ofColumbia. It also includes the US protectorates of Guam and Puerto Rico. The UnitedStates of America is not a country, it is a corporation owned by the same Brotherhoodreptilian bloodlines who owned the Virginia Company, because the USA is the VirginiaCompany! When Americans agree to have a social security number the citizens of theunited states surrender their sovereignty and agree to become franchisees of the UnitedStates (the Virginia Company of the British Crown). So why do they do it? Becausethey have no idea that this is what they are doing. They are led to believe that there isonly one United States and the Federal government is the rightful government. There isno law that says that Americans must pay federal income tax, but they go on payingbecause they think they have to. The Brotherhood-controlled Internal Revenue Serviceoperates in such a terrorist manner that even most of those who know it’s a scam stillpay up because they are terrified not to. Have a sip of that sweet tea now and take adeep breath because there’s more.This means that all the rights which applied to the owners of the Virginia Company tothe gold, silver, minerals and duties, mined and paid in America, still apply to the Britishfamilies who own the United States of America and the lands of the united states ofAmerica. Those same percentages have been paid since ‘independence’ and are stillbeing paid by the American people via their federal officials who are, in fact, officials ofthe Virginia Company - yes, including the President. The British Crown owns the landsof the united states and the land and institutions of the United States, including theInternal Revenue Service which collects the taxation and the Federal Reserve Board, theprivately owned ‘central bank’ of America which lends the government money thatdoesn’t exist and charges the taxpayers interest on it. The Federal Reserve Board is"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"190owned by the same Brotherhood families in Britain and Europe who own the rest ofAmerica. But here’s yet another twist. Who owns the assets apparently owned by theVirginia Company? Answer: the Vatican. On October 3rd 1213, King John, as ‘King ofEngland Corporation Sole’ claimed autonomy over all the sovereign rights of Englandand assigned them to the Pope, who, as Vicar of Christ, claimed dominion over thewhole world. In return, the Pope granted executiveship to the English Crown over allthese dominions. In other words, the Crown is the chief executive and the Vatican is theowner, although, of course, the true owner is whoever controls the Vatican. This is why Ikeep saying that London is the centre of the operational level of the Brotherhood. Evengreater power lies elsewhere, some of it in the Vatican, and, ultimately, I think, on thephysical level, somewhere under the ground in Tibet and Asia. The people of Americahave been bled dry by this scam and continue to be so. Land of the Free? What a joke!And, people of America, your presidents and leading government officials know this. Inturn, it must be stressed, the King John agreement with the Pope presumably gave awaythe sovereignty of England, also. And who controlled King John? The Templars did.When you know what you are looking for, the truth is in your face. I said that theVirginia Company and King James I decreed that criminal courts in the colonies wouldbe controlled by Admiralty Law, the law of the sea. What Admiralty were they talkingabout? The British Admiralty, of course. When a court is being run under Admiralty ormaritime law, the flag in the court has to have a gold fringe around it. Look in anycriminal court in the United States or the united states and you will see it has a goldfringe. The same with many other official buildings. Those ‘American’ criminal courtsare being run under BRITISH admiralty law. The Crown and the Brotherhood familiesof Britain also control the American criminal courts and the core of that control is withthe secret societies based in Temple Bar in London, the former Templar lands, thecentre of the British legal profession. The Grand Lodge of English Freemasonry is inGreat Queen (Isis/Semiramis) Street in London and has controlled most Freemasonryacross the globe since it was formed in 1717. Through this, the British reptile-Aryanscontrol the American judges, lawyers, police, and so on, and through otherorganisations, like the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission,they manipulate the American political system. The American judges are fully awarethat their courtrooms are controlled by British Admiralty Law, but they keep quiet andtake the money. The Rockefeller family are the bloodline branch managers in Americafor the London headquarters and it is the Rockefellers who, quite provably, decide whois going to be President. In other words, the London Elite decide. The Queen ofEngland, Prince Philip and the main members of the British royal family all know thisand are helping to orchestrate it. Who is the Grand Master of the English Mother Lodgeof Freemasonry? The Queen’s cousin, the Duke of Kent.But there is also a French connection to this. There usually is with London andParis the main operational centres for the Brotherhood. Many times the French andEnglish wings have battled for supremacy, but they are still, in the end, two sides ofthe same coin. The French Revolution of 1789 (the year George Washington became"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"191the first US President) was wholly engineered by the Freemasons and their offshoot, theBavarian Illuminati. The background to all this is detailed in .. And The Truth Shall SetYou Free. After the ‘revolutionaries’ executed Queen Marie Antoinette, her son, CrownPrince Louis, still a toddler, was placed under house arrest at the Paris Temple. Twoyears later he was smuggled out in a laundry basket by his doctor, Dr Naudin. Theretarded nephew of the Marquis de Jarjayes was substituted and he died in 1795. Theprince was secretly taken to the Vendee Palace and given sanctuary by Prince Conde. Hewas later moved to a fortress on the River Rhine where he lived under the name of Baronde Richemont. He arrived in England in February 1804 with the former royal paymasterof France, George Payseur, and was protected by King George III, the monarch at thetime of the American War of Independence. The Prince changed his name again toDaniel Payseur while George Payseur became George Bayshore. King George III gavethe prince, now Daniel Payseur, a ship and awarded George Bayshore 600 acres of landin North Carolina. When they arrived in America they were given help by the Boddiefamily, who were related to the British monarchy. Before leaving England, the princebought shares in the Virginia Company and once in America he acquired gold mines,including the Gold Hill Mining Company, which he purchased secretly using a trustee,George Newman, as his frontman or proxy. With the invention of the steam engine,Payseur began to build railroads and leased them to operating companies. He alsoestablished the Lancaster Manufacturing Company to produce timber for railroadproducts and the Lincolnton Iron Company which later located in Chicago and formedtwo subsidiaries, Carnegie Steel and Pullman Standard Company. To provide fuel forlocomotives (or so it was said), the Federal Government (the Virginia Company of whichPayseur was a shareholder) allocated all land extending 100 feet either side of the tracks.Much larger areas of land alongside the railroads were also broken up into sections someten miles square and half of these were given to Payseur who also bought up manyothers. Thus he and the railroads owned some of America’s prime real estate. Much ofthis legislation is in the 1854 Congressional Record. The Payseurs’ Lancaster Railwaywas, through the Alabama Mineral Company, the controller of Coca Cola, Pepsi Cola,General Motors, Boeing, Ford and Standard Oil.After the manipulated American Civil War in the 1860s, all railroads and real estateowned by the supporters of the losers, the southern Confederates, were confiscated andauctioned off at Wilmington, North Carolina. They were bought by nine trustees of DanielPayseur at extremely low prices. A deed of trust was signed in Nashville between therailroad owners and the government establishing the United States Military Railroadsystem which granted the developers a monopoly over transport and communications. Allthese agreements still apply. Payseur’s chief trustee and general manager was a Rothschildrelative called Leroy Springs, formerly Leroy Springstein. It appears that Leroy Springswas a half brother to the American President, Abraham Lincoln. A lady called NancyHanks gave birth to a son in 1808 after an affair with Springs’ father. In his will his fatherleft a large area of land in Huntsville, Alabama, to a son, Abraham Lincoln. Rumours thatLincoln was a Rothschild would appear to have a basis in fact. In the 1850s Lincoln’s"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"192own affair with a daughter of the German monarch Leopold in 1856, produced twingirls, Ella and Emily. One of the descendants of this line was the billionaire, HowardHughes. Many of the famous American families who appeared to be powerful in theirown right turn out to have been leg-men for Payseur and the Virginia Company. AndrewCarnegie was a young employee at a Payseur steelworks who was used to front anothercompany which Payseur called Carnegie Steel. The Vanderbilt family claim that amansion called Biltmore is their country home. Not true. Biltmore was constructed bythe Payseur family as a hotel in the 1880s and it was operated by the Payseur trustees,the Vanderbilts, on a 99 year lease. Another Payseur trustee was J. P. Morgan, one of themost famous industrialists and bankers in American history. He was yet another facebehind which those truly in control could hide the extent of their power.Many of the major oil and mineral deposits in the US are on land owned by therailroad companies, and Payseur’s mineral rights were transferred to petrol and miningcompanies in exchange for a controlling shareholding. Other rights were leased totimber companies. After Daniel Payseur died in 1860, his fantastic empire was managedby his grandson, Lewis Cass Payseur, and the expansion continued apace. In 1872, aPayseur company, the Charleston, Cincinnati and Chicago Railroad, established atelegraph company called Western Union. It formed a subsidiary called AT and T in1875 and today it is one of America’s biggest telephone and communication companies.The Charleston, Cincinnati and Chicago Railroad company is the parent company forthe Federal Reserve, the privately owned ‘central bank’ of the United States. ThePayseur empire became heavily involved in banking. Their Bank of Lancaster becamethe North Carolina Bank and then Nationsbank. The biggest bank in Texas, Interfirst, ofwhich George Bush is a director, merged in 1987 with Republic Bank to form FirstRepublic. This was later absorbed by Nationsbank which then merged with the Bank ofAmerica. These two launder CIA drug money and that’s appropriate because theforerunner to the CIA, the OSS or Office of Strategic Services, was created from thePayseurs’ own security network which was formed by the Selma, Rome and DaltonRailroad to protect the Military Railroad System. It’s all wheels within wheels, familywithin family, and Americans have not a clue who really runs their lives and theircountry. The question is who controlled the Payseurs?The Payseur family have now lost control of their empire, but the same reptilian tribeare still at the helm. The Payseur’s principal trustee, Leroy Springs, died in 1931 and hisplayboy son, Elliot, took over. He volunteered to upgrade the local County Recordsfiling system and removed the records from the Lancaster courthouse. When he returnedthem, hundreds of Payseur land deeds had been re-assigned to Elliot Springs, aRothschild relative. It seems obvious that he was told exactly what to do to stop thePayseur daughters inheriting the empire. In the early 1950s, Anne, the daughter of ElliotSprings, married a New Jersey organised crime figure called Hugh Close and Close wasappointed chairman of all the Payseur companies stolen by Elliot Springs. Close’sdaughter, Mrs Crandall Close Bowles, became a director of the Carolina Federal ReserveBank. A battle continues for control of the former Payseur holdings, but at the moment it"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"193appears they are controlled by the Rothschilds. Some people who think they own landthey have purchased from the railroad companies are going to be very disappointed.Their deeds are not legal because the land was not the railroad companies’ to sell. It wasleased from the Payseur empire. In the end, it is owned by the Virginia Company.Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the Brotherhood President of the United States during theSecond World War, said that nothing ever happens by accident in politics. If it happens, itis meant to happen. So it is with all the major events that have advanced the Agendatowards the centralisation of global power, be they wars, economic collapses,assassinations or ‘scandals’ to remove politicians who are not playing the game. Thethree major wars on American soil have been the war with the native Americans after thewhites first arrived, the War of ‘Independence’ and the Civil War when the states of thesouth sought to withdraw from the union in 1860. We have seen that the wars with thenative Americans and the War of Independence were engineered by the Brotherhood andthe same is true of the Civil War also. Leading Freemasons from all over Europeattended six Masonic festivals in Paris between 1841 and 1845 and it was at six secretSupreme Council meetings held under the cover of these events that the American CivilWar was planned to further impose Masonic, reptile-Aryan, control on America. LordPalmeston, the British Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister, and a Grand Patriarch ofFreemasonry, was at the heart of these conspiracies.8 Two 33rd degree Freemasons of theScottish Rite were chosen to manipulate the conflict. They were Cushing, who worked inthe north among the unionists, and Albert Pike, the Sovereign Grand Commander of theSouthern Jurisdiction of the Scottish Rite, who organised the southern rebellion.9Ironically, but highly appropriately, the funding for the southern rebellion was arrangedthrough London Masonic bankers by Cushing, who was operating in the north!10 Pike, aSatanist who believed in the Aryan (reptile-Aryan) Master Race, enlisted the help ofGiuseppe Mazzini, the head of the Italian Grand Orient Freemasonry, out of whichemerged the infamous organised crime operation called the Mafia. In 1851, Mazzinistarted to establish groups across America which began to campaign against slavery. TheFreemasons used these groups as the cover for the true motivation behind the Civil War.‘Young America’ lodges were organised to do this and their headquarters was at theCincinnati Lodge No 133. Their main funding came from the British Freemasonicbanker and Rothschild frontman called George Peabody and he appointed J. P. Morgansenior to handle the funds in America. Morgan, you’ll recall, was a stooge for DanielPayseur. See how the same names keep coming up wherever you look.Franklin Pierce (the bloodline of George and Barbara Bush) was elected Presidentin 1853 and Mazzini wrote that: “almost all his nominations are such as wedesired.”11 One of these ‘nominations’ was the appointment by Pierce of CalebCushing as his Attorney General. Cushing was controlled by English Freemasonryand connected to the British opium trade to China through his ship-owner father andhis cousin, John Perkins Cushing. Caleb Cushing wrote extensively against slaveryand became the architect, with Pike, of the Civil War. Pike had been a schoolprincipal in Cushing’s home town of Newburyport, Massachusetts, but he was living"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"194in Little Rock, Arkansas, the later home of Bill Clinton, when his Masonic career beganto flourish and indeed, soar. A crucial Elite group behind the Civil War was the Knightsof the Golden Circle, again based in Cincinnati, Ohio. One of their number was theinfamous outlaw, Jesse James, a 33rd degree Mason assigned by Albert Pike to robbanks in the north to further fund the war. Another Knight of the Golden Circle was theFreemason, General P. T. Beauregard, who started the Civil War with an attack on FortSumter in 1861. One of the most famous voices against slavery was John Brown, whobecame a legend through the song about ‘John Brown’s body’. Brown, in fact, was amember of a number of secret societies, including the Freemasons. He became a MasterMason at the Hudson Lodge No 68 in Hudson, Ohio, on May 11th 1824,12 and was amember of Mazzini’s Young America. Brown was funded by the John Jacob Astorfamily, another Brotherhood reptilian bloodline. With the Freemasons whipping upagitation on both sides in classic fashion, the Civil War was about to break out. InJanuary 1857, the Freemason, John Buchanan, was elected President and appointedFreemason, John B. Floyd, as his Secretary of War. The Vice President was John C.Breckinridge, of Kentucky, who received the 33rd degree of the Scottish Rite fromAlbert Pike on March 28th 1860. The President of the rebel or Confederate States of thesouth was the Freemason, Jefferson Davis, and the first state to withdraw from theUnion was South Carolina, the headquarters of Pike’s Southern Jurisdiction of theScottish Rite. Freemasons were at the head of all the other states who followed.Significantly, only eleven states seceded from the Union, but the Confederate flag had13 stars, a sacred number to the Freemasons and the Knights Templar.When Abraham Lincoln became President of the Northern Unionists on March 4th1861, he was offered financial backing for the war by the same people who were fundingthe south, the Masonic bankers of London. There was one catch, however. Lincoln hadto agree to introduce a privately-owned ‘central bank’ of America. One of the mainreasons for the Civil War was to bankrupt America to the point where it would have toagree to allow the creation of the central bank to generate the funds needed to fight thewar. But Lincoln refused and introduced a most obvious policy and one which anygovernment today could follow if they were not all controlled by the bankers. Lincolnsimply printed his own interest-free money called ‘greenbacks’ and used them to financethe government. President John E Kennedy embarked on a similar policy. This is theBrotherhood bankers worst nightmare and Lincoln was assassinated on April 14th 1865,just as Kennedy was assassinated on November 22nd 1963. Lincoln’s assassin was JohnWilkes Booth, a 33rd degree Freemason, and a member of Mazzini’s Young America.13He was selected by the Knights of the Golden Circle who were themselves funded by theLondon Freemasonic bankers. The cover up was headed by the Freemason, EdwinStanton, who ordered blockades of all the roads out of Washington DC, except for theone that Booth used to escape. Alongside this road a drunk of similar appearance andbuild to Booth was murdered and his body burned in a barn. Who officially ‘found’ thisman? Only Edwin Stanton who, of course, identified him immediately as Booth.14 At theconspiracy trial into Lincoln’s death in Indianapolis in June 1865, some of the people"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"195named as directly involved were: Lord Palmeston, the British Prime Minister and 33rddegree Freemason who died in that same year; John Wilkes Booth, 33rd degreeFreemason; Judah P. Benjamin, the voice of the London Freemason bankers whoordered the assassination; and Jacob Thompson, a former Secretary for the Interior, whowithdrew $180,000 from the Bank of Montreal in Canada to bankroll the operation. TheKnights of the Golden Circle were also exposed and Albert Pike decided to change theirname. He called them... the Ku ux Klan, the white-robed Satanists who have terrorisedthe black peoples of America. Their name was taken from the Greek word, kuklos,meaning ‘circle’.15 Pike was born in Boston in 1809 and educated at HarvardUniversity. He became Grand Commander of American Freemasonry and Grand Masterof the Scottish Rite Lodge at Little Rock, Arkansas, later the lodge of one Bill Clinton.When Pike died in 1891 in Washington DC, his funeral was held in the FreemasonicTemple at midnight with the room draped entirely in black.16 This man was a Satanistthrough and through. He is a Freemasonic ‘god’ and his statue stands near theWashington police headquarters, a short walk from Capitol Hill.Before Lincoln died, the Freemason-controlled Congress had passed the NationalBanking Act of 1863 which created a federally chartered national bank with the powerto issue US bank notes. These were notes lent to the government at interest by theMasonic bankers. The bankers had survived the greenbacks and the architect of thatbill, Lincoln’s Secretary of the Treasury, Salmon P. Chase, was such a hero that theFreemasons named one of their banks after him, the Chase Bank, now the ChaseManhattan, controlled (at least officially) by David Rockefeller. I think you will haveseen by now that the great events which have divided humanity and caused constantconflict, be they wars, religions, whatever, come back to the same source and the sameAgenda. What’s more they interweave between the same people in a most remarkableway.In the story I have just told of the creation of the United States, you also find aconnection to the conflict in Northern Ireland. It involves a naturalist and chemist calledDr Edward Bancroft, a close friend of Benjamin Franklin, who had sponsored Bancroft’sFellowship of the Brotherhood ‘science’ front in London, the Royal Society.17 Later hebecame private secretary to Franklin in Paris, a centre of the Brotherhood’s spy network,and joined the Elite Neuf Soeurs Lodge while Franklin was its Grand Master. Bancroftled a secret mission to Ireland in 1779 and a year later Lord Stormont, the BritishAmbassador to France, informed the king that a secret Irish delegation had been to Paristo see King Louis XVI to propose an independent Ireland.

The creation andmanipulation of money.The Brotherhood financial sting is very simple and spans the period we aredocumenting from the time of Sumer and Babylon to the present day. It is based oncreating money that doesn’t exist and lending it to people and businesses in return forinterest. This creates enormous debt for governments, businesses and the generalpopulation, and you therefore control them. Vital to this has been to allow bankers tolend money they do not have. It works like this. If you or me have a million pounds, wecan lend a million pounds. Very simple. But if a bank has a million pounds it can lendten times that and more, and charge interest on it. If even a fraction of the people whotheoretically have ‘money’ deposited in the banks went today to remove it, the bankswould slam the doors in half an hour because they do not have it. Money in the bank isa myth, another confidence trick. When you go into a bank and ask for a loan, the bankdoes not print a single new note nor mint a single new coin. It merely types the amountof the loan into your account. From that moment you are paying interest to the bank onwhat is no more than figures typed on a screen. However, if you fail to pay back thatnon-existent loan, the bank can come along and quite legally take your wealth that doesexist, your home, land, car, and possessions, to the estimated value of whatever figurewas typed onto that screen. More than that, because money is not brought intocirculation by governments, but by private banks making loans to customers, the bankscontrol how much money is in circulation. The more loans they choose to make, themore money is in circulation. What is the difference between an economic boom(prosperity) and an economic depression (poverty)? One thing only: the amount ofmoney in circulation. That’s all. And, through this system, the private banks, controlledby the same people, decide how much money will be in circulation. They can createbooms and busts at will. The same with the stock-markets where these guys are movingtrillions of dollars a day around the financial and banking markets, so deciding if theygo up or down, soar or crash. Stock-market crashes don’t just happen, they are made tohappen.Most of the ‘money’ in circulation is not physical money, cash and coins. It isrepresented as figures passing from one computer account to another electronically via"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"208money transfers, credit cards and cheque books. The more money, electronic orotherwise, that is in circulation, the more economic activity can take place and thereforethe more products are bought and sold, the more income people have, and the more jobsare available. But a constant theme of the reptile-Aryan financial coup has been tocreate a boom by making lots of loans and then pull the plug. Overpaid economists andeconomic correspondents, most of whom have no idea what is going on, will tell youthat boom and bust is part of some natural ‘economic cycle’. What claptrap. It issystematic manipulation by the Brotherhood to steal the real wealth of the world.During a boom many people get themselves into even more debt. The vibrant economicactivity means that businesses borrow more for new technology to increase productionto meet demand. People borrow more to buy a bigger house and a new, more expensivecar, because they are so confident about their economic future. Then, at the mostopportune moment, the major bankers, coordinated by the secret society networks, raiseinterest rates to suppress the demand for loans and they begin to call in loans alreadyoutstanding. They ensure they make far fewer loans than before. This has the affect oftaking units of exchange (money in its various forms) out of circulation. Thissuppresses demand for products and leads to fewer jobs because there is not enoughmoney in circulation to generate the necessary economic activity. So people andbusinesses can no longer earn enough to repay their loans and they go bankrupt. Thebanks then take over their real wealth, their business, home, land, car and possessions inreturn for non-repayment of a loan that was never more than figures typed on a screen.This has been going on in cycles over thousands of years, especially the last fewcenturies, and the real wealth of the world has been sucked out of the population andinto the hands of those who control the banking system - the reptilian bloodlines. Thesame applies to countries. Instead of creating their own interest free money,governments borrow it from the private banking cartel and pay back both the interestand the capital by taxation of the people. Fantastic amounts of the money you pay intaxes go straight to the private banks to pay back loans which the governments couldcreate themselves interest-free!! Why don’t they do it? Because the Brotherhoodcontrols the governments as much as they control the banks.What we call ‘privatisation’ is the selling off of state assets to stave offbankruptcy caused by the bank-created debt. Third World countries are handingover control of their land and resources to the international bankers because theycannot pay back the vast loans made, on purpose, by the banks to ensnare them inthis very situation. The world does not have to be in poverty and conflict, it ismanipulated to be that way because it serves the Agenda. The Knights Templarused the system I’ve just described when they created the foundations of themodern banking network back in the 12th and 13th centuries and this clearlyconnected with the Venetian network of the Black Nobility operating at the sametime. The world financial manipulation is today coordinated by ‘central banks’ ineach country which appear to be working independently, but are in fact workingtogether to a common end. The Bank of England, chartered by the Black Nobility’s"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"209William of Orange, has been the spider at the centre of this web and so, too, sincethe 1930s, has the Bank of International Settlements in Switzerland. Like the Bank ofEngland, the central banks were chartered by the descendants of the reptilian bankingfamilies of Genoa and Venice.The RothschildsOne bloodline which came from the reptile-Aryans within the Khazar empire in theCaucasus Mountains are the Rothschilds. Their leading members are reptile full bloods,reptilians knowingly occupying a human physical form. No overview of the financialmanipulation is possible without considerable mention of the Rothschild gang. Theychanged their name from Bauer to Rothschild and, from their base in 18th centuryFrankfurt, they have been at the heart of the manipulation of the world to this day. Idocument the Rothschilds at length in And The Truth Shall Set You Free, but I will brieflysummarise here because they are so important to the story. The Rothschild bankingdynasty was created by Mayer Amschel Bauer. The reptilian families change their namesto hide their origins and their use and creation of titles has been a great help in this.Bauer changed his name to Rothschild which came from the red shield (rotes schild inGerman) which hung over the door of his house in Frankfurt. Red has been the coloursymbolising revolution since the ancient origins of the Brotherhood, which is why theRussian revolutionaries were called the Reds. On the shield was a hexagram, a Star ofDavid or Seal of Solomon and this same symbol is now on the flag of Israel. Peoplethink it is a Jewish symbol because of its name and use, but this is nonsense. One wasfound on the floor of a 1,200 year old Muslim mosque which stood on the site of presentday Tel Aviv.1 The Jewish writer, O.J. Graham, in his work, The Six Pointed Star, says:“...the six pointed star made its way from Egyptian Pagan rituals of worship, to the goddessAshteroth and Moloch... then it progressed through the magic arts, witchcraft, (includingArab magicians, Druids and Satanists)... through the Cabala to Isaac Luria, a Cabalist inthe 16th century, to Mayer Amschel Bauer, who changed his name to this symbol, toZionism, to the Knesset (parliament) of the new State of Israel, to the flag of Israel, and itsmedical organisation, equivalent to the Red Cross.”2So the very name Rothschild comes from an ancient esoteric symbol connected toEgypt as Moloch (Nimrod) the ‘god’ of sacrifice. The hexagram only became used bythe Jewish hierarchy as their symbol with the emergence of the Rothschilds and it hasabsolutely nothing to do with ‘King David’ as the Jewish leaders well know. It is on theflag of Israel because Israel is not the land of the Jews, it is the land of the Rothschildsand those who dictate to them from even higher up the Brotherhood pyramid. Theycreated Israel and they control it. The red shield used as the emblem of the SalvationArmy was inspired by the Rothschilds, by the way.Frankfurt, the home of the Rothschild dynasty, was where paper money becamepopular and the new European Central Bank is based there. This bank allows a few"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"210unelected bankers to set the interest rates for all the European Union countries using thesingle European currency. As Mayer Amschel Rothschild is quoted to have said: “Giveme control over a nation’s currency and I don’t care who makes the laws.”3 MayerRothschild married Gutele Schnaper, then 16, and they had ten children, five boys andfive girls, who were sent out to establish branches of the dynasty in London, Paris,Vienna, Berlin and Naples. The Rothschild children were married by arrangement tonoble families and to each other at cousin level to maintain the reptilian bloodline andkeep the power ‘in house’. Mayer’s will specifically insisted on this and also thatRothschild men must always head the business and accounts must be kept strictlysecret. The will excluded Rothschild daughters, their husbands and heirs, from thebusiness and all knowledge of it. So just because your name might be Rothschild doesnot mean you are a Satanist or know what is going on. I am talking about those at thetop of this empire and the same applies to all the families I mention. Most members ofthese families will be shocked to find what has been going on around them. What we donot want is a witch-hunt against everyone who carries these family names or the reptilerace in general. It is those knowingly responsible we need to expose, not the innocentpuppets who happen to be in the same family or have the same name.Mayer Rothschild became banker and manipulator to Prince William IX of Hesse-Hanau, another member of the Black Nobility reptilian bloodline, and they attendedFreemason meetings together. According to the book, Jews And Freemasons In Europe(1723-1939), William’s younger brother, Karl, was accepted as the head of GermanFreemasons and members of the Hesse dynasty were closely involved with an EliteFreemason group called the Strict Observance. This was later called the BeneficentKnights of the Holy City,4 and was known in Germany as The Brethren of John theBaptist (a code for Nimrod).5 The House of Hesse were on Hitler’s side in the SecondWorld War and Prince Philip of Hesse was a messenger between Hitler and Mussolini.6After they took the British throne William and Rothschild made a fortune hiring Hessetroops to the German Hanoverians. Many of the troops who fought for ‘Britain’ in theAmerican War of Independence were William’s German mercenaries. William was thegrandson of the Hanoverian king of England, George II, and is therefore an ancestor ofQueen Elizabeth II. By another line, he is also related to her husband, Prince Philip.Goodness knows how many of the reptilian Hesse bloodline are out there, becauseWilliam alone is estimated to have fathered at least 70, yes 70, children by variouswomen.7 How did he find the time? But this is another important point. The reptile-Aryan offspring produced through the arranged marriages are the official heirs. Butliterally thousands are produced unofficially outside of marriage and these are notcredited to that bloodline. However, they are carefully documented and the Brotherhoodknow exactly who these people are. They want to know which are the reptile bloodlinesbecause they know they will be easiest to ‘plug in’ to the reptilians on the lower fourthdimension. This is one reason for the highly detailed genetic records kept by theMormons, another Brotherhood operation at its top level. So when people in powerappear to have no blood links with these families, the opposite may be true. A number"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"211of researchers believe Bill Clinton to be a closet Rockefeller and he is certainly blood-related to the British monarchy, every Scottish monarch, and King Robert I of France.St Germain, now a ‘messiah’ figure to many New Agers, was a friend of William ofHesse-Hanau, and his brother, Karl. Apparently, Karl wrote that Germain, an alchemistand magician, had been raised by the de Medici (Black Nobility) family in Italy.8 ManyNew Agers today talk about the Great White Brotherhood of ‘master souls’, includingGermain, who are communicating ‘guidance’ to channellers about the comingtransformation. This is yet another mind control operation by the Brotherhood tomisdirect and imprison the more extreme of the New Age mentality and to stop itgetting off its collective arse (and the ceiling) and so making a real difference.Political unrest caused by Napoleon Bonaparte made William of Hesse-Hanau takeflight to Denmark for a while, and during this time Mayer Rothschild’s eldest son,Nathan, another Freemason like most of them, stole £600,000 which should have beenused to pay the mercenary soldiers. He took it to London to establish a Rothschild bankthere. The fortune he made from this by funding Wellington’s war with Napoleon andother manipulated ‘investments’ formed the foundation of the dynasty. Both Wellingtonand Napoleon were manipulated and funded by the same people who includedNapoleon’s brother, Joseph Bonaparte, a Freemasonic Grand Master. The Rothschilds,even according to some of their own histories, constantly funded both sides in wars.They engineered these wars through the secret society network and their ownintelligence operation which continues today. It is called Mossad which is officially theintelligence agency of Israel, but Israel is Roth-rael and so Mossad is Roth-ad. AnkaMuhlstein, the Jewish author of Baron James, The Rise Of The French Rothschilds,says the family intelligence network used Hebrew letters as a code. Hebrew was thesacred language of the Egyptian mystery schools, which is where much Brotherhoodknowledge came from, along with the ancient knowledge of Asia and the Far East,which is also connected with the Khazar bloodlines. The Rothschild communicationsnetwork was faster than any government system and one of the famous examples ofRothschild double-dealing was when they spread a rumour that Wellington had lost toNapoleon in the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. This caused a crash on the London stock-market and the Rothschilds secretly bought up stock at knockdown prices. When thenews arrived that in fact Wellington had won, the stocks rose in price again and theRothschilds had increased their wealth by an incredible amount. When, like theRothschilds, you control the media, the politicians, and the stock-market, makingmoney is child’s play and so is starting wars. Every working day, the world price ofgold is still set at the London offices of N.M. Rothschild and the stock-markets acrossthe world are controlled by the Babylonian Brotherhood through banking and financialfamilies like the Rothschilds. If there is a banking and stock-market crash in the FarEast, it is because it suits the reptilian Agenda. Another of their cycles is to encouragepeople to invest in the stock-market until the quoted companies are massivelyovervalued. The Brotherhood then crash the markets (having sold their stocks justbefore) and while most people lose their money, the Brotherhood buy up vast amounts"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"212of stock at bargain prices. The stock-market goes up, so does the value of the newlyacquired companies, and the Brotherhood wealth and control takes another leapforward. It’s all manipulation to achieve the reptilian goal of total global control.Creating wars is a wonderful way to make vast fortunes and destroy the status quo.You lend money to both sides to fund the war and then you lend them even more torebuild their devastated countries. They get in debt (control) to you and you increaseyour wealth (power). Such control and power allows you to build a new society in theimage of your agenda, when the war you have created and funded has destroyed theold structure. The so-called Protocols of the Elders of Zion were discovered in the lastcentury and tell in incredible detail the events and methods of manipulation we haveseen manifest in the 20th century. These documents were very much the creation of theRothschilds and the reptilian-Aryans. But they are not really the Protocols of theElders of Zion, they are, in truth, the Protocols of SION, the Sun, and the Priory ofSion. So much disinformation and aggression has been hurled at the Protocols andanyone who has mentioned them - including me - because the Brotherhood aredesperate to discredit their contents. It is far too close to home. Hitler used theProtocols in part to justify the oppression of Jews, but he was given the Protocols by aRothschild agent of Khazar decent called Alfred Rosenberg. I don’t accept that theProtocols are ‘Jewish’ in the way people have come to understand that term. They arethe work of the reptile-Aryans and made to appear ‘Jewish’ so that we lose the plot.See .. And The Truth Shall Set You Free for more details of this and The Robot’sRebellion for the contents of the Protocols.The Rothschild’s became one of the pivotal families in the Brotherhood’sfinancial and political Agenda and they went on to direct events throughout Europebefore expanding into the Americas, South Africa and eventually the world. Theyhad the crown heads of Europe in debt to them and this included the Black Nobilityreptilian dynasty, the Habsburgs, who ruled the Holy Roman Empire for 600 years.The Rothschilds also took control of the Bank of England. If there was a war, theRothschilds were behind the scenes, creating the conflict and funding both sides.The Rothschild leaders are not Jewish, they are reptilians who have sent countlessJews to their deaths to further their sickening ambitions. They have been closeassociates of the House of Windsor and they controlled people like Edward VII, theGrand Master of English Freemasonry. Edward was the son of Queen Victoria andthe German Freemason, Prince Albert. The Mountbattens (formerly the GermanBattenbergs) are blood relatives of the Rothschilds and Lord Louis Mountbattenarranged the marriage of Queen Elizabeth II to his grandson, Prince Philip, twoequal strands of the reptilian Black Nobility. Mountbatten was also the mentor ofPrince Charles. When victims of Satanic ritual abuse tell me that the late LordMountbattan was among their abusers, it fits the picture completely. That’s thebackground he came from. The Rothschilds and the Bauers (also Bowers) aresteeped in Satanism and both the Rothschilds and the Windsor-Mountbattens arereptilian, Anunnaki bloodlines. The Bauers, particularly a man called Richard"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"213Bauer, were leading alchemists and esoteric magicians in Germany in the MiddleAges.9 Karl Marx, the Brotherhood frontman for the creation of Communism, was astudent of a Bruno Bauer at Berlin University and this Bauer was the only Bible scholaron record who openly wrote that the New Testament was a synthesis of ideas betweenSeneca and Josephus (Piso).10 He said that Jesus was the creation of the writer ofMark’s Gospel.11 Yet more evidence that the bloodlines of the Brotherhood have knownthe truth all along.The Rothschilds were involved in the Tugenbund League (also the Virtue League)which was formed in 1786 as a ‘sex society’. Its members, and their wives anddaughters, would meet at the home of a woman called Henrietta Herz and take part insexual activity and rituals. Among them were two daughters of Moses Mendelssohn, aRothschild agent behind the manipulation of the French Revolution; the Marquis deMirabeau, the Freemason also intimately involved in the revolution; and Frederick vonGentz, who would become a very influential Rothschild agent.12 In 1807, therefollowed the second Tugenbund League, again involving the Rothschilds. It was formedby Baron von Stein and expanded rapidly to include most leading politicians inGermany and many of the top military leaders and professors of literature and science.William of Hesse-Cassal was a member and the official role of this second TugenbundLeague was to remove the Napoleonic occupation of Germany.13 It was close to otherMasonic groups like the Black Knights, the Knights of the Queen of Prussia and theConcordists. These were offshoots of the ancient Teutonic Knights structure inGermany and the predecessors of the Thule Society, the Edelweiss Society, and VrilSociety, which were to be the architects of the Nazi Party. It is the same face withdifferent masks and the Rothschilds have been behind most of them - including theNazis. All these groups interlock if you dig deep enough.This apparently complex (but ultimately simple) network of banking, business,politics, media, and secret societies, controls the world on behalf of the Brotherhoodoperational headquarters in London. The control of money and banking via theRothschilds and others are crucial to this. One of the Brotherhood’s most importantcoups was the creation in 1913 of the Federal Reserve, the so-called ‘central bank’ of theUnited States. It is neither federal nor has any reserve. It is a cartel of private banksowned by the 20 founding families, mostly European, which today decides the interestrates for the United States and lends non-existent money (figures on a screen) to the USGovernment on which the taxpayers have to pay interest. This is what we call the‘American Deficit’ - it is fresh air. The Federal Government of the United States does notown a single share in the Federal Reserve and American citizens cannot purchase them.Profits exceed $150 billion a year and the Federal Reserve has not once in all its historypublished audited accounts. This income is assured because 1 the Brotherhood controlthe US Government (the Virginia Company under another name) which continues toborrow ‘money’ from the ‘Fed’; 2 they also control the privately-owned InternalRevenue Service (IRS), the illegal terrorist organisation which collects the taxation fromthe people; and 3 it controls the media to ensure that people never find out about 1 and 2."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"214The Brotherhood had long desired a privately-owned ‘central bank’ in America tocomplete their control of the economy. When the leading Freemason, GeorgeWashington, became the first president he appointed a Brotherhood yes-man calledAlexander Hamilton as his Secretary of the Treasury. Hamilton introduced the Bank ofthe United States, a privately owned central bank which began to lend money to thenew US Government so creating control by debt from the very start. Look at whathappened when the Black Nobility introduced the Bank of England, and the scenario isexactly the same. The Bank of the United States caused so much poverty, bankruptcyand rebellion, that it was eventually closed down, but soon after that came itsreplacement, the Federal Reserve. The Rothschild’s main banking operation in Americain the early part of this century was Kuhn, Loeb and Company in New York which washeaded by Jacob Schiff. The Schiff family lived in the same house in Frankfurt as theRothschilds at the time of the founder, Mayer Amschel Rothschild. In 1902, theRothschilds sent their agents, Paul and Felix Warburg, to America to engineer thecreation of the Federal Reserve. Their brother, Max Warburg, stayed behind to run thefamily banking business which had been started in Venice under their previous name,the Abraham del Banco family. When they arrived in the States, Paul Warburg marriedNina Loeb, of Kuhn, Loeb and Company, and Felix married Frieda Schiff, daughter ofJacob Schiff. Another wonderful example of arranged marriages to suit the demands ofthe bloodlines and the Agenda. Both brothers became partners in Kuhn, Loeb andCompany and Paul was put on an annual salary of some half a million dollars in theopening years of this century. That’s the sort of money we are talking about when wediscuss the financial power of this group. Imagine what it must be today.The Brotherhood network ensured that the ‘Democrat’ and Rosicrucian, WoodrowWilson, won the presidency in 1909 and his minder was a leading Brotherhood membercalled ‘Colonel’ Mandel House. Wilson described him as “my second personality”, “myalter ego” , and said: “his thoughts and mine are one”. Never has a President said a truerword. As is now well documented by researchers, the Elite bankers from theRockefeller-Morgan-Rothschild-Harriman cartels met secretly at Jekyl Island inGeorgia to discuss tactics and the nature of the bill they wished to be passed to establishthe bank they so badly desired. Jekyl Island, it appears, was owned by the Payseurs andevery member of the group was a Payseur trustee. Their political spokesman wasSenator Nelson Aldrich, the grandfather of Nelson Rockefeller, the four times governorof New York and vice-president of the United States after Gerald Ford replaced RichardNixon in the wake of Watergate in 1974. Aldrich’s daughter, Abby, was married to JohnD. Rockefeller Jr. When the Federal Reserve Bill was going before Congress thebankers who had written the bill vehemently opposed it in public. The bankers werevery unpopular by this time and they wanted to give the impression that the bill was badfor them, so increasing the public support for it to be passed. This sort of manipulationgoes on all the time and no matter what anyone is saying about an event in public, weneed to keep asking the question “Who benefits from this happening?” and “Whobenefits from me believing what I am being told?”"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"215They pushed the bill through just before Christmas 1913 when many Congressmenwere already at home with their families for the holiday. Now they could controlAmerican interest rates and make a fortune lending the government money that doesn’texist and charging interest on it. To complete the cycle, however, they needed to ensurean endless supply of funds for the government and so they introduced a Federal IncomeTax Bill, also in 1913. To do this they needed an amendment, the 16th, to the AmericanConstitution, and that required the consent of at least 36 states. Only two states agreed,but Filander Knox, the Secretary of State, simply announced that the required majorityhad been achieved and the bill was introduced. To this day the enforced payment offederal income tax is illegal and yet the Brotherhood’s Internal Revenue Service goeson doing that in the United States every day. Some may say that calling it a terroristoperation is too extreme, but to terrorise someone you don’t have to use a gun or abomb. You can do it by threatening to destroy their livelihood and evict them from theirhome to pay you tax that is illegal. Incidentally, note the year of these two events, theFederal Reserve and the Federal Income Tax - 1913. Numbers and years matter to thesepeople because of the Sun and astrological cycles and so it would all have been timed tohappen in 1913. Look at the obsession the Brotherhood groups throughout history havehad with the number 13. When the Rockefellers set up their Council of StateGovernments to control the American state legislatures, they based the organisation in abuilding numbered 1313. For the same reason, a great deal happened in 1933 because33 is a major esoteric number which represents a vibrational frequency.The Internal Revenue Service which collects taxation in America is also a privatecompany, though the public believe it is part of their government. In 1863 the Bureau ofInternal Revenue was formed to collect taxation, but in 1933, that year again, came thestart of another coup on the American people. Three members of the Prescott Bushcircle, Helen and Clifton Barton and Hector Echeverria, formed the Internal RevenueTax and Audit Service, registered in Delaware, America’s flag of convenience state,where few questions are asked. Prescott Bush was the father of George Bush. In 1936,this organisation changed its name to the Internal Revenue Service and ran as a privatecompany. In 1953, the original Bureau of Internal Revenue was disbanded, leaving theprivate Internal Revenue Service to collect all the taxes, illegal taxes most of them, too.This is controlled by the same people who own the Federal Reserve and the VirginiaCompany and it is bleeding America dry. The Internal Revenue Service was,appropriately, created by American Nazis who were funding Adolf Hitler under thecoordination of Prescott Bush, George’s father.The black magicians of the Babylonian Brotherhood have weaved their web ofdeceit from the ancient world to the present day, but because they wear smart suits inpublic and save their long robes and Satanic masks for their private rituals, most peoplefind it almost impossible to comprehend the truth of what is going on before their eyes."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"216SOURCES1Hirsch M.

And The Truth ShallSet You Free and I won’t repeat it all again here. I will, however sketch thefundamentals of what happened to bridge the gap to the new and stunning information Iwish to pass on.The exploitation of the incredible continent of Africa is a classic story whichserves as an example of what has happened elsewhere. This horrific operation by theRothschilds, Oppenhiemers, Cecil Rhodes, Alfred Milner> Jan Smuts and countlessothers, was organised through an Elite secret society called the Round Table, formedin the latter years of the 19th century. It was headed by Cecil Rhodes who said hewanted to create a world government centred on Britain. Rhodes headed the SouthAfrica Company and established companies like De Beers Consolidated Mines andConsolidated Cold Fields. Rhodes was also Prime Minister of the Cape Colony andhe is said by writer John Coleman (who claims to be a former British Intelligenceoperative), to have been a member of an organisation called the Committee of 300,also known as The Olympians. These, he claims, are the three hundred people who, ineach generation, run the world under the supervision of even smaller groups abovethem in the highest levels of the pyramid. I will use the abbreviation (Comm 300) todepict others I name who are listed by Coleman.1 Some people, I should point out,doubt Coleman’s British Intelligence connections. A contact who has worked at ahigh level in the financial world, particularly in Switzerland, told me that he believesthese 300 families are the most reptilian on the planet and that is how they qualify fortheir appointment to this network. Rhodes began his career in manipulation while astudent at Oxford University, that training ground for Brotherhood personnel. Hismentor was John Ruskin, the fine arts professor who is still a legend at Oxford.Ruskin said he believed in centralised power and the state owning the means ofproduction and distribution. His ideas would form the official philosophy of theBritish Labour Party until more recently and tbey were also included in the writingsof Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels and became the foundations of Marxistcommunism which was soon to grip the nations of Eastern Europe. Ruskin is widelybelieved by researchers to have been connected with the Bavarian Illuminati and itwas his inspiration which led to the formation of the Fabian Society, yet anotherBrotherhood operation which to this day manipulates the British Labour Party andoperates further afield. Ruskin was a student of Plato’s works, as were most"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"218Brotherhood clones like Rhodes, Engels, Weishaupt, the Rothschilds and theRothschild associate, Moses Mendelssohn, one of the principle manipulators behind theFrench Revolution. Rhodes was so in awe of Ruskin that he copied his inaugural speechin long hand and kept it with him for the rest of his life. Ruskin had a tremendousimpact on many undergraduates at Oxford and Cambridge who would later play theirpart in the manipulation of the 20th century, including the Rothchild-controlled banker,Alfred Milner.While Rhodes was the frontman for the Round Table, the real control was with theRothschilds and the other bloodline families like the Astors and the Cecils. The Astorfamily were big financial backers of Brotherhood organisations like the Royal Instituteof International Affairs and Waldorf Astor was one of its leaders. The Astors were thecentre of the group known as the Cliveden Set named after their Cliveden Estate, not farfrom Windsor Castle. The name Astor comes from the ancient goddess, Ashtoreth. Oneof the Cecils was Lord Salisbury (Comm 300), the British Prime Minister and ForeignSecretary when the Round Table was engineering the Boer War in South Africa inwhich tens of thousands of men, women, and children were killed. Many of them diedin the concentration camps of the Freemason, Lord Kitchener (Comm 300). LordSalisbury was a close friend of Winston Churchill, another bloodline frontman whowould be used to great effect in the Second World War. This manipulation and genocideby Rhodes and the Round Table secured control of the mineral rights in southern Africawhich still continues today through the Oppenheimer family. The Union of South Africaitself was created by the Round Table after a campaign headed by the banker andRothschild manipulator, Alfred Milner (Comm 300), who became the new leader of thesecret society after Rhodes died in 1902. In his will, Rhodes bequeathed funds tosupport the Round Table, although the Rothschilds were the main funders. The will lefta considerable amount of money to fund a scheme known as Rhodes Scholarships.These finance a few highly selected overseas students (selected by the Brotherhood) toattend Oxford University to be indoctrinated into the ‘world government’ Agenda. Theratio of these students who return to their own countries and enter positions of overt orcovert power is remarkable and the selection process is overwhelmingly governed bygenetic history. For example, the most famous Rhodes Scholar in the world today is BillClinton, President of the United States, and his main advisor at both of his elections wasGeorge Stephanopoulos, a Rhodes Scholar. The leaders of the future are not decided ateach election, they are reared and mind manipulated to hold those positions from a veryyoung age, sometimes birth, as we shall see a little later. Another man selected for aRhodes Scholarship was Fred Franz, the former president of the Watchtower Society(Jehovah’s Witnesses), who turned down the invitation to Oxford and instead served theBrotherhood by replacing the leader of the Jehovah’s Witnesses, the Freemason,Charles Taze Russell, who was ritually killed on Halloween 1916.2 The magazine of theJehovah’s Witnessess, the Watchtower, is a mass of esoteric symbolism and subliminalimages. George Estabrooks, who taught the use of hypnotism and mind control toBritish Intelligence, was also a Rhodes Scholar.3"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"219By 1915 other branches of the Round Table were set up in South Africa, Canada, theUnited States, Australia, New Zealand and India. In the United States, the Round Tableand the wider network was represented by the bloodlines and financiers who hadarrived from Europe like the Rockefellers, J. P. Morgan and Edward Harriman, althoughas we have seen even they were wealthy ‘gofers’ answerable to higher powers. Theyused Rothschild and Payseur funding to build vast empires which controlled banking,business, oil, steel, etc, and ran the United States economy in the way theOppenhiemers do in South Africa. All these branches, however, are subordinate to thecentral operational control centre in Europe, especially London. These same families inAmerica, the so-called ‘Eastern Establishment’, are the force behind one of American’smost sinister and Satanic secret societies, the Skull and Bones Society, based in awindowless mausoleum at Yale University in Connecticut known appropriately as the‘Tomb’. Here highly selected students meet twice a week during term time. Thisinterlocks with the Templars, the Freemasons and the Round Table network. The skulland bones symbol relates to the skull ceremonies of the Knights Templar and manyother Brotherhood groups which inspired this Satanic, blood drinking, secret society.Other Brotherhood universities in the United States, like Harvard, have similar secretsocieties, but the Skull and Bones appears to be the most influential. A network of thesame kind operates in Britain at Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh and other Universities.The Skull and Bones Society is believed to have been introduced to the United Statesmore than 150 years ago as Chapter 322 of a German Secret Society and was alsoknown at one time as the Brotherhood of Death. With George Bush a member, I can’tthink of a better name than that. What is known for sure is the Skull and Bones Societywas formed in 1832-33 by a group which included Daniel Coit Gilman, the manresponsible for setting up the American tax exempt foundations like the RockefellerFoundation and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Other Skull andBones founders were General William Huntington Russell and Alphonso Taft, of afamous American family. Taft was Secretary of War in the Grant administration and hisson, William Howard Taft, was the only man to be both President and Chief Justice ofthe United States. Like the Russells, the Tafts are an ancient bloodline family related toSkull and Bones member, George Bush. The Skull and Bones is deeply racist and wasfounded on the money made from the illegal drug operations of the Russells. ThisSociety is incorporated into the Russell Trust and its initiation ceremonies take place onan island in the St Lawrence River owned by the Russell Trust Association. Most of theland on which Yale University is built is also owned by the same association.The Russell family made their fortune from running opium from Turkey to Chinaduring the British opium wars against the Chinese, when the BlackNobility-Brotherhood in London was invading China by flooding that society withaddictive drugs. The Russells later fused their operation with other bloodline familieslike Coolidge and Delano (Comm 300 family designate), both of which producedPresidents of the United States, Calvin Coolidge and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. TheRussells used to fly the skull and bones flag on their ships carrying the drugs and the"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"220Skull and Bones Society continues this drug running tradition through people like GeorgeBush, one of the major drug barons in North America. The Skull and Bones Society isdominated by about 20-30 families overwhelmingly from the Eastern Seaboard. Mostclaim ancestry with the British aristocracy (true) or have a genetic line going back to theEnglish ‘Puritan’ families who arrived in American around 1630-1660 under the policy ofemigration inspired by Sir Francis Bacon and his circle. These families have either securedfinancial power themselves or married into wealth via the sons of moguls like theRockefellers and Harrimans. The key criteria for membership of the Skull and Bones isyour genetic history Are you reptilian enough? Major players in the manipulation of the20th century have been initiated into the Skull and Bones Society whilst students at Yale.Among them Averell Harriman, son of Edward, and one of the Brotherhood’s most activemanipulators before his death at 91 in 1986. George Bush’s father, Prescott Bush, was alsoa Skull and Bones member and it was he who ransacked the grave of the Apache Chief,Geronimo, and took his skull back to the Yale headquarters for their skull ceremonies. (See.. And The Truth Shall Set You Free.) Prescott Bush made his fortune through the Harriman(Payseur/Rothschild) empire and would later help to fund Adolf Hitler.So by the early years of the 20th century the situation was this: The BabylonianBrotherhood operational network headquartered in London had introduced another Elitegrouping called the Round Table with branches all over the world. This operation andits interlocking secret societies, banks, businesses, newspapers, and political placemen,controlled the United States, Canada, South Africa and other African countries,Australia, New Zealand, India, many parts of the Far East, including Hong Kong, andvast swathes of the rest of the world under the title of the ‘British Empire’.Fundamentally involved in this network was the British royal family headed afterQueen Victoria by her Freemason son, Edward VII, and when he died in 1910 cameGeorge V Edward, in league with his Black Nobility friends in the City of London,greatly increased the personal fortune of the royal family. They were soon to changetheir name from the German House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor to obscure theirGerman origins during the horrors of the First World War. With these global networksnow in place, the scene was set for the grotesque manipulation of the 20th Century. Iwill briefly describe the background to some of the main events in this chapter, but forgreater detail and sources see .. And The Truth Shall Set You Free.The First World WarThe Brotherhood wanted a global war as a massive problem-reaction-solution todestroy the global status quo so allowing them to rebuild the post war world in theirimage. It worked brilliantly. After the First World War, power was in far fewer handsthan it was before. The British and American governments in the immediate post warperiod were controlled by the Round Table leadership. In Britain these were peoplelike Alfred Milner (Comm 300) and Lord Balfour (Comm 300) and in America,Colonel House (Comm 300), the dictator of policy to President Woodrow Wilson. InGermany the official head of the country was Kaiser Wilhelm II, a relative of the"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"221British/German royal family soon to be known as the Windsors. Wilhelm’s ‘minder’was the leading German Freemason, Otto von Bismark, the architect of the GermanEmpire, and other Freemasons and bloodline families. Kaiser Wilhelm’s Chancellor wasBethmann-Hollweg, a member of the Bethmann banking family in Frankfurt and acousin of the Rothschilds. Wilhelm’s personal banker was Max Warburg, the brother ofPaul and Felix, who had helped to manipulate the US Federal Reserve into being.Meantime, the Rothschilds had bought the German news agency, Wolff, to control theflow of information to the German people and what the rest of the world would hearfrom inside Germany. One of the leading executives of Wolff was... Max Warburg. TheRothschilds would later buy an interest in the Havas news agency in France and Reutersin London. (News agencies supply ‘news’ to all media organisations.) All that wasneeded to spark the war was an incident which could be used to justify hostilities andthat was provided when an agent of a Serbian secret society called the Order of theBlack Hand assassinated Archduke Ferdinand, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throneon June 28th 1914. At exactly the same time in Russia, an attempt was being made onthe life of the Tsar’s most trusted advisor, Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin, who wasarguing against a war. The Black Hand was formed in 1911 as the Order of Death andits seal was a clenched fist holding a skull and bones and alongside that was a knife, abomb and a poison bottle.4 Lovely. Leading members of the Black Hand apparently metwith French and Grand Orient Freemasons at the Hotel St Jerome in Toulouse inJanuary 1914 to arrange the assassination in Sarajevo.5 The actual assassins, led byGavrilo Princip, were all suffering from tuberculosis and did not have long to live. Theywere suckers manipulated to carry out an act thinking it would serve Serbiannationalism when it was really the spark required to advance an Agenda they probablydid not know existed. So it is with assassins and terrorists galore over thousands ofyears. How do such people stop themselves being used in this way? Very simple. Don’tkill anyone, harm anyone, or plant bombs under any circumstances whatsoever. There,all sorted.The German branches of the Brotherhood network started hostilities and the branchesin the rest of Europe followed. The people who actually fought this war were theinnocent pawns in a game they did not understand. Half a million men died in one battlein the trenches of northern France, a gigantic orgy of blood letting in an area which issacred land to the Satanists and blood drinkers who run this world. These are mass ritualsacrifices to the reptilians. The war was created by problem-reaction-solution and thesame technique was used to bring the United States into the conflict as planned. In hiselection campaign for the presidency, Woodrow Wilson had told the American peoplethat he would not allow America to become involved in a European war. He had to saythat or he would not have been elected. But he knew that was part of the BrotherhoodAgenda and so in 1916 the American passenger ship, the Lusitania, was sunk and thiswas used as an excuse to enter the war. In the same way, the assassination of Ferdinandwas Germany’s excuse and in 1941 the attack by the Japanese on Pearl Harbour wasused by the American reptile-Aryan President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, to enter the"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"222Second World War. A member of one of the bloodline families, Alfred GwynneVanderbilt, was on the Lusitania when it sank. An urgent telegram telling him not to sailon that voyage failed to reach him. The head of the US War Industries Board wasanother vital cog in the Brotherhood network in this century. He was Bernard Baruch(Comm 300), who said that he had.. “probably more power than perhaps any other mandid in the war...”6 Baruch and Mandel House were the day-to-day decision makers inthe American branch of the London-based Round Table.In the 1950s, yet more confirmation of how the First World War was manipulatedwas revealed by a US Congressional investigation into the ‘tax-exempt’ foundations in theUnited States, like the Rockefeller Foundation, the Ford Foundation, and the CarnegieEndowment for International Peace, which the investigation found was manipulating war!Another thing to watch. The Brotherhood name organisations in a way that leads peopleto believe their aim is the opposite of what they are really there to do. For instance, if youwant to run drugs without being suspected, do it through an anti-drug agency. If you wantto destroy land and kill wildlife, do it through a wildlife protection agency. If you want torun a Satanic ring, do it through the Christian Church. The Congressional investigation bythe Reece Committee found that these foundations had an interlocking leadership and thatthey were funding ‘education’ and ‘science’ to advance their Agenda for the centralisationof global power. The outcome of scientific ‘research’ was being agreed before the fundingwas handed over. No agreement on the outcome, no cash. This is one major way thatscientific knowledge is suppressed. Knowledge which could set the world free fromhunger and the need for the expensive, polluting ‘energy’ technology we have today. Therelevant findings of the Reece Committee in relation to the First World War came withtheir investigation into the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Norman Dodd,the committee’s Director of Research, reported that at one meeting of the Carnegietrustees, the question was asked:“‘Is there any means known to man more effective than war if you want to alter the lives ofan entire people?’ It was decided that there was not and so the next question they askedwas: ‘How do we involve the United States in a war?’.”Dodd went on:“And then they raised the question: ‘How do we control the diplomatic machinery of theUnited States?’ And the answer came out: ‘We must control the State Department’. At thispoint we catch up with what we already found out... that through an agency set up by theCarnegie Endowment, every high appointment in the State Department was cleared. Finally,we were in a war. These trustees in a meeting about 1917 had the brashness to congratulatethemselves on the wisdom of their original decision because already the impact of the warhad indicated it would alter life and can alter life in this country. This was the date of our entryin the war; we were involved. They even had the brashness to word and to dispatch atelegram to Mr Wilson cautioning him to see that the war did not end too quickly.”7"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"223Dodd said that his investigator, Kathryn Casey, found other minutes dealing with thework of the Carnegie Endowment to prevent American life returning to a pre-war state.Changing the way people lived and thought was, after all, the main point of the war.Dodd said:“They came to the conclusion that, to prevent a reversion, they must control education.And then they approached the Rockefeller Foundation and they said: “Will you take on theacquisition of control of education as it involves subjects that are domestic in theirsignificance?” And it was agreed. Then together they decided that the key to it was theteaching of American history and they must change that. So, they then approached themost prominent of what you might call American historians at that time with the idea ofgetting them to alter the manner in which they presented the subject.”8This is why you don’t read what really happened in the official history books. You readwhat the Brotherhood wants you to read. This is the crap that is taught to our children inschools and universities under the heading of ‘education’. The same with all the othersubjects. This is the ‘education’ that American families spend their lives scrimping andsaving for. They are scrimping and saving to pay for their children to be indoctrinated,that’s the reality. The point of the First World War was to reshape the post-war world in theimage the reptilians desired. So the very people who engineered the war on all ‘sides’ wereappointed to the Versailles Peace Conference, near Paris (again!) in 1919 to decide whatwould happen as a result of the war they had manufactured. The Palace of Versailles is alsoknown as the Palace of the Sun King. The ‘victorious’ stooges, sorry leaders, at Versailleswere Woodrow Wilson of the United States, Lloyd George (Comm 300) of Great Britain,and Georges Clemenceau of France. But behind the movie screen what was reallyhappening? Wilson was ‘advised’ by Colonel Mandel House (Comm 300) and BernardBaruch (Comm 300), both Rothschild-Round Table representatives; Lloyd George wasadvised by Alfred Milner (Comm 300), official leader of the Round Table and Sir PhillipSassoon, a direct descendant of Mayer Amschel Rothschild; Clemenceau had GeorgesMandel, his Minister of the Interior, whose real name was Jeroboam Rothschild. Also onthe American Commission to Negotiate Peace were the infamous Dulles brothers; PaulWarburg; Thomas Lamont from J. P. Morgan (Payseur); Robert Lansing, the Secretary ofState, an uncle of the infamous Dulles brothers; and Walter Lippman (Comm 300), thefounder of the American branch of the Fabian Society. All bloodline reptilian families.The German delegation included Max Warburg, brother of Paul Warburg on theAmerican side! The host of the conference was Baron Edmund de Rothschild, a leadingcampaigner for a Jewish State in Palestine, for which the Versailles Peace Conferenceconfirmed its support. And none of the history books will tell you any of this. Out of theconference came the World Court in The Hague, Netherlands, and the League ofNations, the Brotherhood’s first attempt to create a global organisation which could beevolved into a world government. The first draft of what became the covenant of theLeague of Nations was written by Colonel House, as were Woodrow Wilson’s famous"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"224‘fourteen points’ at Versailles. Years earlier, House had written a novel called Philip Dru:Administrator, which he later admitted was fact presented as fiction. In the book,published anonymously two years before the First World War, he had proposed anorganisation called... the League of Nations. The war was all a plot to further the Agendaand it cost the lives of millions. The League of Nations eventually collapsed, but one warlater their ambition was achieved with the creation of the United Nations in 1945.The Russian Revolution/Cold WarThe Russia Revolution in 1917, during the First World War, lead to the formation of theSoviet Union and later to the Cold War. A constant theme of Brotherhood manipulationthrough the centuries is the creation of monsters for people to fear, something theyproceeded to do with Communism in the Soviet Union and China. The hierarchy ofthese two regions interlock with the Brotherhood network and bloodlines, but of coursethe people don’t know that. The public believed that the United States leadership wasopposed to the Soviet Union because one was capitalist and one was communist. Nottrue. They are different kinds of cartels, that’s all, and controlled, ultimately, by thesame people. Communism was created by Wall Street and the City of London togenerate enormous fear and conflict which was used to great effect to advance theAgenda. As always, it was planned long before it became public. The CommunistManifesto was written by (or for) Karl Marx and Freidrich Engels. Marx was a studentof the German occultist, Bruno Bauer (Rothschild) and married into the reptilianbloodlines of the Scottish aristocracy. Some of his writings were vehemently anti-Jewish which appears contradictory because he was supposed to be Jewish. But hewasn’t. He was another ‘Aryan’ bloodline doing his job for the cause - the reptile cause.All these years the far left in politics have revered Marx as a ‘man of the people’ whenall along he was a man to imprison the people. The action began in Russia when theRothschilds manipulated the Tsar into a war with Japan in 1905. The EuropeanRothschilds lent money to the Russians for that conflict while their American branch,Kuhn, Loeb and Company, funded the Japanese. The war demolished the Russianeconomy, not least to pay back the Rothschilds, plus interest, and this helped to fuel thesimmering rebellion. When the First World War began and Russia came in againstGermany, weapons supplies to the Russian army were systematically delayed byRothschild companies like Vickers Maxim, and eventually the soldiers mutinied.Vickers Maxim was controlled by Ernest Cassel, a business associate of Kuhn, Loebamd Company and the biggest shareholders were the Rothschilds. The daughter ofErnest Cassal would marry Lord Mountbatten, a Rothschild,9 and the man who arrangedthe marriage of Queen Elizabeth II to his nephew, Prince Philip. The interconnectingreptilian bloodlines are simply fantastic.The Russian Revolution ended 300 years of rule by the Romanov family which hadbegun in the 17th century with Mikhail Romanov; who is believed to have beensupported by the occultist and Rosicrucian, Dr Arthur Dee, and the British SecretService. Arthur Dee was the son of Dr John Dee, the infamous astrologer to Queen"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"225Elizabeth I. But these families are all subordinate to the Agenda and now it was time forthe Romanovs to go. The same applied to the Habsburg and Hohenstaufen dynasties inthe same period. The infrastructure was long in place to unseat the Romanovs, withFreemasonry, the Rosicrucians, and other secret groupings flourishing in Russia fromthe second half of the 18th century. The first charge to remove the Romanovs was ledby Alexander Kerensky, a Freemason, funded from Wall Street and London. A secondand more brutal wave was led by Leon Trotsky and Lenin. Trotsky left Germany to livein New York and it was from there that he set off on his journey to Russia and theBolshevik Revolution. He entered Russia on a United States passport provided for himby the President, Woodrow Wilson, and on his person was $10,000 provided by theRockefellers. He was joined in Russia by Lenin who was given safe passage in a sealedtrain across Germany from Switzerland via Sweden. Massive amounts of Bolshevikpropaganda was financed by the Germans. While Lenin, Trotsky, and the rest werepublicly condemning ‘capitalism’, they were being financed by the Brotherhoodbankers of Wall Street and London, the same people who would later support Hitler. Inhis autobiography Trotsky would refer to some of these loans, many of which werearranged by the Round Table’s Alfred Milner and ‘Alexander’ Gruzenberg (real nameMichael), the chief Bolshevik agent in Scandinavia. He was a confidential advisor tothe J. P. Morgan (Payseur)-owned Chase National Bank in New York. One of the mostactive middle men between the Bolsheviks, London, and Wall Street, was OlofAschberg who became known as the Bolshevik’s banker. He owned Nya Banken,founded in Stockholm in 1912. Aschberg’s London agent was the North CommerceBank, chaired by Earl Grey, a member of the Round Table and friend of Cecil Rhodes.Another close associate of Aschberg was Max May, the vice-president of the J. P.Morgan (Payseur) Guaranty Trust and head of its overseas operations.In 1915, the American International Corporation had been formed to fund theRussian Revolution. It’s directors represented the interests of the Rockefellers, Kuhn,Loeb and Company (Rothschilds), DuPont, Harriman, and the Federal Reserve. Theyalso included George Herbert Walker Bush, the grandfather of George Bush. TheRothschilds were directly financing the Revolution via Jacob Schiff at Kuhn, Loeb andCompany. International Brotherhood bankers from Britain, the United States, Russia,Germany, and France met in Sweden in the Summer of 1917. They agreed that Kuhn,Loeb and Company would deposit $50 million in a Swedish bank account for Lenin andTrosky’s use. In an article in The New York American Journal on February 3rd 1949,Jacob Schiff’s grandson said that his grandfather had paid the two ‘revolutionaries’ anadditional $20 million. The payment of $20 million to the Bolsheviks by Elishu Root(the Kuhn, Loeb and Company’s lawyer and former Secretary of State) via the SpecialWar Fund, is recorded in the Congressional Record of September 2nd 1919. Thisinvestment not only furthered the Brotherhood Agenda, it realised an unbelievableprofit. Some researchers suggest that Lenin repaid Kuhn, Loeb, the rouble equivalent of$450 million between 1918 and 1922. This was nothing compared with the profitsaccrued from the exploitation of Russian land, its economy and people, including the"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"226theft of the Tsar’s gold and his vast financial holdings which were held, and stolen, bythe very banks who had funded the revolution.

And The Truth Shall Set You Free, but I wanted to give you enough to see that theRussian Revolution, and all that came out of it, was another operation by theBrotherhood.Communism would also be played against Fascism (the same thing in truth) in theSecond World War, and when that was over, fear of the Soviet ‘monster’ was used tofurther manipulate global events and justify enormous arms spending with the veryarmament and aircraft companies owned by the reptilians. Therefore they ensured therewas either parity or the Soviet Union were slightly ahead, and in this way they createdfear on both sides and a reason to keep buying ever more expensive weapons from theircompanies - ‘keep up with the Russians’. The Cold War was classic manipulation. Thepeople of the West were terrified of the Soviet Union and the people of the Soviet Unionwere terrified of the West while both sides were secretly controlled by the same people.At the heart of this was the emergence of nuclear weapons during the Second World Warthanks to the Manhattan Project in America led by Robert Oppenhiemer. The ManhattanProject was supported by the Brotherhood-controlled Institute for Advanced Study atPrinceton University where Albert Einstein was a regular visitor. Einstein, who workedon the development of the atomic bomb, was a close associate of Bernard Baruch andLord Victor Rothschild (Comm 300), the man who controlled British Intelligence fordecades. Rothschild used these very contacts to supply the State of Israel with the know-how to build nuclear weapons. But, of course, if the United States had these devastatingweapons and the Russians did not, there would be no Cold War, so the technologicalknowledge was passed on to them. Pavel A. Sudoplatov, the head of the SovietIntelligence Bureau on the atomic problem during World War Two, has now confirmedthat Oppenhiemer was supplying data about the bomb to the Soviet Union during thewar.10 Klaus Fuchs, the German physicist, worked on the Manhattan Project after fleeingfrom Germany to Britain in 1933. Fuchs, an associate of Lord Victor Rothschild, waslater jailed for fourteen years for supplying British and American atomic secrets to theRussians. I know from people I have met in the intelligence community in the UnitedStates, and from the research of other writers, that nuclear weapons know-how was beingpassed from the United States to the Soviet Union throughout the Cold War, not leastthrough the Pugwash Conferences inspired by Einstein and Bertrand Russell (Comm300) of the bloodline Russell family. Pugwash comes from the name of the Canadianestate of the industrialist Cyrus Eaton, where the conferences were held. Eaton began hiscareer as secretary to J. D. Rockefeller and became a business partner of the Rockefellerdynasty. In 1946, Bertrand Russell, a friend of Einstein, said it was necessary to use thefear of nuclear weapons to force all nations to give up their sovereignty and submit to thedictatorship of the United Nations.11Eventually the Agenda’s time-scale reached the point where the countries of theSoviet Union had to be encompassed into the European Union and NATO in line with"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"227the plan for a world government and world army. That could not be done while theSoviet Union was still there and seen as the ‘evil empire’. Onto the stage suddenlycame Michail Gorbachev; an associate and subordinate of those two Brotherhoodmanipulators, Henry Kissinger and David Rockefeller, and it was his job to play thegood guy and break up the Soviet Union. The Berlin Wall came down and peoplethought it was a blow for freedom, but it was just another step on the road to totalglobal domination. Gorbachev left office and now runs the Brotherhood-fundedGorbachev Foundation which puts on prestigious conferences calling for a worldgovernment. He is another shape-shifting reptilian as seen by contacts of mine.The creation of IsraelZionism is often said to be the heart of the conspiracy, but I don’t agree. It is part of ityes, but the Brotherhood network is far bigger than that. Zionism is not the Jewishpeople, it is a political movement. Many Jews do not support it, many non-Jews do.To say that Zionism is the Jewish people is like saying the Democratic Party is theAmerican people. Yet to challenge the extremes of Zionism is to be called anti-Semitic or anti-Jewish. What utter balls. Just as the Republic of South Africa is reallythe Fiefdom of Oppenheimers, so the State of Israel is really the State of Rothschild.Zionism was the creation of the Rothschilds on behalf of the Brotherhood and in truthit is not Zionist, but SIONism, a branch of the reptile-Aryan Sun cult religion. It hasbeen used to ensure the take over of Arab Palestine for two main reasons. This issacred land for the reptile-Aryans going back to the Levites and the ancient world.Also blatantly stealing an Arab country offered endless opportunities to foster conflictand division in the Middle East, and this was particularly effective in manipulatingthe Arab oil states. The crucial moment in the Rothschild plan for ‘Israel’ was theBalfour Declaration when the British Foreign Secretary, Arthur (Lord) Balfour,announced on November 6th 1917 that Britain supported the claim for a Jewishhomeland in Palestine. The Rothschild-dominated Versailles Peace Conferenceconfirmed their support for this also. Surprise, surprise. But what was this BalfourDeclaration? It was not made to members of the Westminster Parliament. It wassimply a letter from Lord Balfour (Comm 300), an inner-circle member of the RoundTable secret society, to Lord Lionel Walter Rothschild (Comm 300), who funded theRound Table! It was a letter between two members of the same secret society.Rothschild was a representative of the English Federation of Zionists which was setup with Rothschild money. It is widely believed by researchers that the ‘Balfour’letter was actually written by Lord Rothschild together with Alfred Milner (Comm300), the Round Table’s leading light who had been made chairman of the mininggiant, Rio Tinto Zinc, by the same Lord Rothschild. Rio Tinto is heavily involved inSouth Africa and a major shareholder apparently is the Queen of England. The Arabsof Palestine were used to fight the Turks in the First World War under the commandof the Englishmen, T. E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) who promised them fullsovereignty for their efforts. All along he knew that the Brotherhood plan was for the"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"228‘Jewish’ (Khazar-Aryan) homeland in Palestine. Lawrence, a close friend of WinstonChurchill, later admitted this fact when he said:“I risked the fraud on my conviction that Arab help was necessary to our cheap and easyvictory in the East, and that better we win and break our word, than lose... The Arabinspiration was our main tool for winning the Eastern War. So I assured them that Englandkept her word in letter and in spirit. In this comfort they performed their fine things; but, ofcourse, instead of being proud of what we did together, I was continually bitter andashamed.”12Such has been the reptile-Aryan modus operandi for thousands of years. It was theRothschilds who funded the early ‘Jewish’ settlers in Palestine; it was the Rothschildswho helped to create and fund Hitler and the Nazis in the Second World War whichincluded the sickening treatment of Jews, gypsies, communists, and others; it was theRothschilds who used the understandable post-war sympathy for the ‘Jews’ they hadmercilessly exploited to press through their demands for a take-over of Arab Palestine; itwas the Rothschilds who funded the ‘Jewish’ terrorist groups in Palestine which bombed,murdered, and terrorised Israel into existence; and it was the Rothschilds who funded andmanipulated these terrorists into the key positions in Israel, among them the PrimeMinisters, Ben-Gurion, Shamir, Begin, and Rabin. These men would spend the rest oftheir lives condemning the terrorism of others with an hypocrisy which beggars belief; itwas Lord Victor Rothschild, the controller of British Intelligence, who provided theknow-how for Israel’s nuclear weapons; it was the Rothschilds who owned and controlledIsrael from the start and have continued ever since to dictate its policy; it was theRothschilds and the rest of the Brotherhood network which has hidden and suppressed thefact, confirmed by Jewish historians, that the overwhelming majority of ‘Jewish’ peoplein Israel originate genetically from the Caucasus Mountains, not from the lands they nowoccupy. The Jewish people have been sacrificed on the Rothschild altar of greed and lustfor power, but even the Rothschilds take their orders from a higher authority which, Ibelieve, is probably based in Asia, and the Far East dictates to the operationalheadquarters in London. Ultimately, the whole scam is orchestrated from the lower fourthdimension. For the background, detail, and sources, to support the statements I have justmade, again you will find them in .. And The Truth Shall Set You Free.The Second World WarAt the Versailles Peace Conference in 1919 a number of decisions were made whichculminated in the genocide known as World War Two. Firstly the reparations imposedon the German people were so fantastic that the Weimar Republic which followed thewar had no chance of economic survival. This was precisely as planned. That economicchaos was a massive problem in need of a solution and the solution was Adolf Hitler.The second important development, in a secret meeting of the Versailles collaborators atthe Hotel Majestic in Paris, was the creation of offshoot organisations connected to the"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"229original Round Table. The first came in 1920 with the formation of the Institute ofInternational Affairs, also known as Chatham House, at 10 St James’s Square inLondon. The monarch is its official head and it was given the title Royal Institute in1926. It’s American branch, the Council on Foreign Relations, was formed by theAmerican members of the Round Table in 1921 with funds from the Rockefellers andothers. These were additions to the Brotherhood network designed to control even morecompletely British and American politics and indeed the much wider world. They areboth the same organisation under different names. The Royal Institute of InternationalAffairs (RIIA) was formed by friends of Cecil Rhodes and all the familiar names,including the Astors. It was funded, as it is today, by a long, long, list of globalcorporations and media groups owned by the bloodline families. I list them in .. AndThe Truth Shall Set You Free.The Royal Institute connects into the top levels of politics, banking, business, media,all the usual stuff. For instance, one of its top figures was Major John (Jacob) Astor(Comm 300), a director of the Hambros (Brotherhood) Bank and owner after 1922 of theTimes newspaper. Other founders included Sir Abe Bailey, the owner of Transvaal Minesin South Africa who worked with Alfred Milner to start the Boer War; and John W.Wheeler-Bennett, who would be General Eisenhower’s ‘political advisor’ in London inthe last two crucial years of the Second World War when the design for the post war worldwas being drawn. The Institute interlocks with British universities like Oxford andCambridge and the London School of Economics which has produced many of the‘radicals’ of the political ‘left’. Adolf Hitler’s infamous book, Mein Kampf, was ghost-written by Major General Karl Haushofer, who acknowledged that a major source of theideas it expressed was Halford J. MacKinder, a director of the London School ofEconomics. As with the Round Table, Royal Institute branches were established inAustralia, Canada, New Zealand, Nigeria, Trinidad and Tobago, and India, where it isknown as the Council of World Affairs. Its American branch, the Council on ForeignRelations (CFR), made its home at Harold Pratt House at 58 East 68th Street in NewYork, the former mansion of the Pratt family, friends of the Rockefellers. It was organisedby Colonel Mandel House, J. P. Morgan (Payseur), the Rockefellers, and their associates.The CFR was soon in control of the United States and that remains the case today. Lookat its membership and you will find the top people in all the institutions which control thelives of the American people, including education. These organisations, like the RoundTable, are made up of inner and outer circles.The inner circle knows the Agenda andworks full time to achieve it. The next circle knows much of the Agenda and works to thatend in their particular sphere of influence. The next circle is pretty much in the dark aboutthe real Agenda, but is manipulated to make the ‘right’ decisions in their area of operationwithout knowing the true reason for them. Admiral Chester Ward, a former US JudgeAdvocate General of the Navy, was a member of the CFR for sixteen years. He said thatthe purpose of the organisation was the “...submergence of US sovereignty and nationalindependence into an all-powerful one-world government”. In his book, Kissinger On TheCouch, written with Phyllis Schafly, Ward said:"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"230(the)... lust to surrender the sovereignty and independence of the United States ispervasive throughout most of the membership, and particularly in the leadership of severaldivergent cliques that make up what is actually a polycentric organisation... (the mainclique) is composed of the one-world-global-government ideologists - more respectfullyreferred to as the organised internationalists. They are the ones who carry on the traditionof the founders.”Since 1921 virtually every President of the United States has been a member of theCFR along with most of the main government posts including most, today all, theAmerican ambassadors around the world. The CFR also includes media owners, keyjournalists and editors, educationalists, military leaders, on and on it goes. Themembership of the Royal Institute of International Affairs remains a secret, but it alsoincludes people of the same positions and background in the United Kingdom and Istress the American CFR is subordinate to, and takes orders from, the Royal Institute inLondon. These interlock with the Illuminati; the ‘knight’ Orders like the Knights of StJohn of Jerusalem (Malta); the network controlled by the British monarch which I willreveal later; the Freemasons, Rosicrucians, and the Round Table; the American‘foundation’ network like the Rockefeller Foundation and an endless web ofinterconnecting groups operating ultimately to the same global leadership. This networkwas spanning the globe by the 1930s and the Brotherhood was ready for its biggestproject yet, the Second World War. It was an effort to achieve further centralisation ofpower and the creation of a global body which could be evolved into a worldgovernment. We know that body today as the United Nations.With the German economy in tatters and inflation running at thousands of per cent,the German people looked to Adolf Hitler as their saviour. Problem-reaction-solution.As I document and source in .. And The Truth Shall Set You Free, the Nazis werefunded from Wall Street and the City of London. This was done via the Germansubsidiaries of British and American companies and American loans known as theYoung Plan and the Dawes Plan. These loans were supposed to be helping Germany topay the reparations, but in fact went straight into Hitler’s war machine. Standard Oil(the Rockefellers) and I. G. Farben, the German chemical cartel which ran theconcentration camp at Auchwitz, were, in effect, the same company. Hitler came topower in 1933 and in that same year, no coincidence, Franklin Delano Rooseveltbecame President of the United States. His route to power was the same as Hitler’s. In1929, the Brotherhood bankers crashed the Wall Street stock-market and caused theGreat Depression. From this problem came the solution, the ‘New Deal’ economicpackage offered by Roosevelt which won him the presidential election of 1933. This‘New Deal’ was a replica of the economic package offered by Hitler to the Germanpeople to solve their manufactured economic problems. When he came to power,Roosevelt pulled off one of the biggest thefts in human history when he passed lawsforcing the American people to hand over all their gold to the government in return forworthless pieces of paper known as Federal Reserve banknotes. This was necessary, he"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"231said, to solve the dire economic problems. Soon afterwards, with the American economynow completely under Brotherhood control, Roosevelt put their symbol, the pyramid andall seeing eye, on the dollar bill. He was saying to the American people: “Gotch-yer”.Franklin Roosevelt, a 33rd degree Freemason, held the title, Knight of Pythias, in asecret society called the Ancient Arabic Order of Nobles and Mystics. Among itsprevious members were Francis Bacon and the French revolutionary, Mirabeau.Membership is only open to Freemasons who have reached at least the 32nd degree orare members of the Templar lodges of Freemasonry.13 The Order was allegedly foundedby a descendant of Mohammed who based it on a secret society in medieval Europewhich included Jews, Arabs, and Christians.14 Its symbol is a crescent moon representedby the claws of a Bengal Tiger, engraved with a pyramid, an urn, and the pentagram, acombination representing the Universal Mother: Isis-Semiramis-Ninkharsag.15Roosevelt’s Secretary of Agriculture, Henry Wallace, was also an occultist who wasinvolved in the decision to put the all-seeing eye symbol on the dollar bill.16 Wallacehad a guru, the Russian mystic and artist, Nicholas Roerich, who spent many yearstravelling through Nepal and Tibet studying with the lamas and searching for the lostcity of Shamballa, the legendary home of the secret occult adepts or ‘masters’ who aresaid to have secretly influenced’ world affairs throughout history. They are variouslyknown as the Secret Chiefs, the Hidden Masters, or the Great White Brotherhood andsome researchers believe they are the force behind the creation of the Freemasons,Sufis, Knights Templar, Rosicrucians, Theosophical Society, and the Hermetic Order ofthe Golden Dawn.17 I think these people are reptilians, some of them anyway. Roerichwas involved in the formation of the League of Nations, the first attempt at worldgovernment, and supported the work of Dr Andrija Puharich, a scientist who helped todevelop the psychic powers of a young Israeli called Un Geller.18In Britain, the Round Table-Royal Institute of International Affairs members in theHouses of Parliament at first called for appeasement with Germany until Hitler’smilitary build up had reached the point where he could fight a long war. Thensuddenly, as I show clearly in .. And The Truth Shall Set You Free, they switched andcalled for all-out war against Hitler. Among the most grotesque examples of this wereLady Astor, Leopold Amery, Lionel Curtis, and Lord Lothian, all members of theRound Table and/or the Royal Institute of International Affairs. Lord Halifax, theForeign Secretary and a Round Table member almost from its foundation, wasanother who supported the appeasement of Hitler. He met Hitler on November 19th1937 and Hitler’s representative, Alfred Rosenberg, had come to Britain in May 1933,to meet with Sir Henry Deterding (Comm 300), head of Royal Dutch Shell, GeoffreyDawson, the editor of the Times newspaper owned by the Astors (Round Table, RoyalInstitute, Comm 300), the 1st Viscount Hailsham, the Secretary for War, Walter EliotMP, and the Duke of Kent, brother of King Edward VIII and King George VI. Wewill see the British Royal family’s Nazi connections later. The sudden change fromappeasement with Hitler to war with him was mirrored in Downing Street as theappeaser prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, was replaced by the Brotherhood’s"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"232man of war, Winston Churchill, on May 11th 1940. Soon after his appointment, themass bombing of civilian targets in Germany began. The reptile-Aryan black magicianshad themselves another global blood ritual.Churchill’s membership of the Freemasons has often been played down as it has withPrince Philip. But Churchill was in fact, behind the scenes, a very active Mason after hisinitiation into the Studholme Lodge (No 1591) at the Cafe Royal in May 190119 Localhistorians in Bradford, England, uncovered evidence that some of Churchill’s wartimepolicies were influenced by the fact that he and King George II of Greece were Masons.One example of this was in 1943 when Churchill sent 5,000 troops to Athens to restoreGeorge to the throne even though the beleaguered monarch was detested by all sides andthe troops were needed elsewhere.20 The Churchill family has close links with theRothschilds and the esoteric underground. Winston Churchill joined the Albion Lodge ofthe Ancient Order of Druids at Blenheim Palace on August 15th 1908.21 His father, LordRandolph Churchill, was funded by the House of Rothschild while he was Chancellor ofthe Exchequer in the mid 1800s and his closest friend was Nathaniel Rothschild. WhenRandolph died, he was in debt to the Rothschilds to the tune of £65,000, a fantasticamount in those days.22 Winston, too, was in debt to them and he was a good friend ofLord Victor Rothschild, the orchestrator of British Intelligence, and the Rothschilds’ archmanipulator in the United States, Bernard Baruch. Churchill had close links with theCecil family who, in effect, controlled him, and the Cecils have long time connectionswith the networks created by that Brotherhood front, the Jesuits, and to the Habsburgs,the British monarchs, and the families of the Black Nobility in Italy. The Churchills arerelated to the Duke of Marlborough family who played an important role in puttingWilliam of Orange on the British throne and in fact Winston Churchill was born at theirancestral home, Blenheim Palace, near Oxford. Churchill knew exactly what he wasdoing and the image of him left us by official history is a farce. He did not save theBritish Isles from tyranny, he was part of the tyranny.An American decoding officer at the United States Embassy in London called TylerKent was jailed throughout the war for passing evidence to the Conservative MP ColonelRamsey, that Churchill and Roosevelt had been communicating in coded messages beforeChurchill was Prime Minister making arrangements to ensure that war would break out.Ramsey was also jailed under a law called Regulation 18b which was introduced justbefore the war, the Government said, to deal with terrorism by the Irish Republican Army(IRA). Another problem-reaction-solution. This was merely the excuse they used to havea law in place that would allow them to jail people without trial during the war and sokeep the lid on their game. One woman, an admiral’s wife, was jailed under regulation18b as she left a courtroom which had cleared her of all charges! The man behind this lawwas Lord Victor Rothschild, one of the most important manipulators of the second half ofthe 20th century and a friend of Winston Churchill. It was Churchill who began to useRegulation 18b as soon as he took office in order to jail people who knew what was goingon and were prepared to say so. The American Ambassador in London in this period wasJoseph Kennedy, the deeply crooked father of John F Kennedy. The Kennedy’s are an Elite"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"233bloodline going back to the Irish kings and beyond. To complete the set, the Britishambassadors in America during the war were Lord Lothian of the Royal Institute ofInternational Affairs and Lord Halifax of the Royal Institute, Round Table, andCommittee of 300. Franklin Roosevelt won a second term as President in 1937 byrepeating over and over that the sons of America were not going to fight in another warin Europe, while he knew full well that that was exactly what they were going to do.Representative Philip Bennett of Missouri told Congress:“But our boys are not going to be sent abroad, says the President. Nonsense, MrChairman; even now their berths are being built in our transport ships. Even now the tagsfor identification of the dead and wounded are being printed by the firm of William C.Ballantyne and Co of Washington.”23Roosevelt had come to power for the second time by saying that America would notfight in another war in Europe and so when he returned to the White House he had apublic relations problem because he was already helping to arrange that very war. Aswith Woodrow Wilson and the sinking of the Lusitania, a problem-reaction-solutionwas organised to give him the excuse to break his ‘promises’. In 1939, Senator P. Nyeof North Dakota said that he had seen a series of volumes called The Next War,including one called Propaganda In The Next War which originated in London (ofcourse!). It revealed the game plan for manipulating America into the Second WorldWar. This document, written between the wars, said:“To persuade her (the United States) to take our part will be much more difficult, so difficultas to be unlikely to succeed. It will need a definite threat to America, a threat moreover,which will have to be brought home by propaganda to every citizen, before the Republicwill again take arms in an external quarrel...“...The position will naturally be considerably eased if Japan (my emphasis) were involved,and this might and probably would bring America in without further ado. At any rate, itwould be a natural and obvious effect of our propagandists to achieve this, just as in theGreat War they succeeded in embroil mg the United States against Germany.“Fortunately with America, our propaganda is on firm ground. We can be entirely sincere,as our main plank will be the old democratic one. We must clearly enunciate our belief inthe democratic form of government, and our firm resolve to adhere to... the old goddess ofdemocracy routine.”24On December 7th 1941, Japanese planes attacked Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and theUnited States entered the war. It has since been established that many interceptedmessages gave Roosevelt considerable prior warning of the Japanese attack, but noaction was taken and Americans were left to die for the sake of the Brotherhood Agenda"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"234as literally billions of people have these past few thousand years. The attack itself cameafter a long campaign by the Americans to goad Japan into attacking them. HenryStimson, Roosevelt’s Secretary of War and a founder of the Council on ForeignRelations, had said: “We face the delicate question of diplomatic fencing to be done soas to be sure Japan is put into the wrong and makes the first bad overt move.”25That is the brief summary of how the Second World War was visited upon the planetand how tens of millions of men, women, and children, lost their lives. The climax was todrop two atomic bombs on Japan which had already agreed to surrender on the very sameterms it eventually agreed to after the bombs had caused such devastation. Again thedetailed background to all this is in .. And The Truth Shall Set You Free. The man whoordered those bombs to be dropped was President Harry S. Truman who had replacedFranklin Roosevelt at the end of the war. Truman was a 33rd degree Freemason and whenhe reached that level he added the middle ‘S’ which stood for Solomon. Truman was afailed haberdasher and deemed unemployable before the Freemasons launched his career.His mother lost her farm because of his debts and when he became President he used to goon nightly drunken binges around the back alleys of Washington followed at a discreetdistance by two FBI agents despatched by J. Edgar Hoover to look after him.26 Truman’scareer took off after he became chief organiser of the Freemasonic lodges in Missouri andthen he was nominated to become a judge before moving into the White House.27 The manbehind this meteoric rise was another Mason and the head of organised crime in KansasCity, Boss Prendergast.28 Truman’s closest confidant was David Niles, or Neyhus, who hadone sister in an important position in the government of Israel and another making policyin Moscow!29 This is the background to Harry S. Truman, the Freemason placeman, whorefused to accept Japan’s terms of surrender, ordered the atomic devastation, and thenaccepted the surrender on the same terms he had refused before. The bombs were droppedbecause as one phase ended in the reptilian Agenda, another was immediately begun - theCold War - and it is so much easier to engender the fear necessary for that if people haveseen for themselves what happens when one of these devices explodes.After the war, the world was mentally, emotionally, spiritually and physicallydevastated. This allowed the banks to make vast fortunes lending money to governments torebuild the societies destroyed by a war the same banks had funded. This massivelyincreased the debt owed by nations to private banks and the control over those countriesincreased in proportion. The desperation for peace made the world open to the main reasonthe Brotherhood had created the war -the formation of the United Nations. Problem-reaction-solution (see Figure 22). The charter for the United Nations, the global body theBrotherhood so badly wanted, was written by a committee of the Council on ForeignRelations. The writer, James Perloff, revealed the background to the UN in his 1988 book,The Shadows Of Power: The Council On Foreign Relations And The American Decline:“In January 1943, the Secretary of State, Cordell Hull, formed a steering committeecomposed of himself, Leo Pasvolsky, Isaiah Bowman, Sumner Welles, Norman Davis, andMorton Taylor. All these men - with the exception of Hull - were in the CFR. Later known as"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"235the Informal Agenda Group, they drafted the original proposal of the United Nations. It wasBowman - a founder of the CFR and a founder of Colonel House’s old ‘Inquiry’ (anotherElite grouping) - who first put forward the concept. They called in three attorneys, all CFRmen, who ruled that it was constitutional. Then they discussed it with Franklin D. Roosevelton June 15th 1944. The President approved the plan and announced it to the public thenext day.”30In his book, The American Language, H. L. Mencken suggests that the term ‘UnitedNations’ was decided by President Roosevelt during a meeting with Winston Churchillat the White House in December 1941, shortly before the attack on Pearl Harbor. Whenthe United Nations was officially formed in San Francisco on June 26th 1945, the USdelegation included 74 members ofthe CFR, including John J.McCloy, the CFR chairman from1953-70, a member of theCommittee of 300, chairman of theFord Foundation and theRockefellers’ Chase ManhattanBank, and friend and advisor tonine presidents from Roosevelt toReagan. Also there were JohnFoster Dulles, the Hitler supporter,CFR founder, and soon-to-be USSecretary of State, and NelsonRockefeller, the Satanist and archmanipulator, who was four timesGovernor of New York and VicePresident to Gerald Ford afterRichard Nixon was ousted byWatergate. Remember, too, thatwhile the CFR created the UnitedNations, it is still only a branch ofthe Royal Institute of InternationalAffairs in London, which is only an offshoot of the Round Table, which is only anagency of an even higher authority in the hierarchy. The Rockefellers paid for theheadquarters of the League of Nations in Geneva and now they gave the land for theUnited Nations building in New York. The land had previously been used for aslaughter house and that was exactly what the Satanists of the Brotherhood wanted.Land covered in blood, fear, and pain, for the foundations of the organisation designedto do the same to human beings.The UN is a Trojan Horse for world government and it sits atop a vast network oforganisations which present themselves as serving the people when in fact they areProblem-Reaction-Solution(Second World War)"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"236fronts for the most grotesque manipulation, not least in the developing world of Africa,Asia, South and Central America.

The UNPopulation Fund uses ‘population control’ for a policy of eugenics against people withblack faces and those with white faces who are not up to the genetic ‘purity’ (reptilianbloodline) demanded by these deeply imbalanced people. The UN EnvironmentProgramme uses the environment as an excuse to create international laws, take controlof great swathes of land, and steal land from developing countries under the heading of‘debt for nature’ swaps. UNESCO, the science and culture operation, advances theAgenda across many areas of life. Now the United Nations, which was set up to stopwar, according to the propaganda, is actually going to war.

This is no surprise because the Nazi Party was the creationof a network of secret societies which had access to the underground stream ofknowledge that carries the true, or truer, story of human origins.Germany has long been a centre for esoteric thinking and secret societies and, as wehave seen, among the most prominent occult families in Middle Ages Germany werethe Bauers, a strand of which changed their name to Rothschild. Much of the Windsorblood also comes via Germany. The Bavarian Illuminati, which was involved in manyof the ‘people’s’ revolutions in Europe, including the French, was founded in Germanyon May 1st 1776 by the occultist, Adam Weishaupt, and the Christian Church was splitinto Catholics and Protestants by Martin Luther, the German agent for the RosicrucianOrder. Germany is another centre for global manipulation. Hitler was not the creator ofNazi belief, merely the public expression of it. In the 19th century one of the pre-Hitlerprophets was the composer Richard Wagner, and his composition, The Ride Of TheValkyries, captures his obsession with the invading powers of evil. Wagner declared theimminent arrival of the Master Race. His work, The Ring, was the musical expression ofhis belief in German ‘supermen’ bestriding the world stage like the ancient Pagan gods,Wotan and Thor. Hitler would later say that to understand Nazi Germany, one had toknow Wagner. One of the students of master-race fanatic Wagner, was the composer,Gustav Mahler. His studies with Wagner were funded by Baron Albert de Rothschild.One of the places to which Wagner travelled and researched was Rennes-le-Chateau,that mysterious village in southern France so connected to the Knights Templar and theCathars. Indeed, the German secret society underground is closely aligned to theTemplar traditions and those contemporaries of the original Templars, the TeutonicKnights.Adolf Hitler was officially born in 1889 at Braunau-am-Inn, on the border ofGermany and the Austria-Hungary Empire. There are, however, other theories whichsuggest that he was actually of a Rothschild bloodline or even was Prince Albert,Duke of Clarence and Avondale, the grandson of Queen Victoria, who was supposedto have died of pneumonia at Sandringham in January 1892. His funeralarrangements decreed that there would be no lying in state, no embalming of thebody, and no ‘excess’ of mourning. Albert does not appear to have been ‘the fullpicnic’, as they say, and Hitler certainly wasn’t. There were rumours at the time that"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"239Albert’s death had been faked because his mental instability made him unfit for theresponsibilities of kingship (I can’t think why!). There are many theories about PrinceAlbert, including one that he was the notorious serial killer in Victorian London knownas Jack the Ripper, who killed his prostitute victims in ritual fashion and wroteFreemasonic messages at the scene of his crimes. One thing is obvious from theevidence, Jack the Ripper was connected to the highest levels of the Britishestablishment and, most probably, the royal family. There have been claims and rumoursperiodically that Prince Albert didn’t die at Sandringham and instead was taken toGermany. This would have been easy because the British royal family of Queen Victoriaand the Prince Albert were a German royal line and they had more blood relatives inGermany than they did in England. The name of the ‘British’ royal house at that timewas the German House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. In the early years of the Nazi Party,when Hitler was virtually unknown outside of Bavaria, three of his financial sponsorswere the Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, the Grand Duke of Hesse, and the Grand DuchessVictoria, the former wife of the Grand Duke of Hesse. All were first cousins to Albert,Duke of Clarence! Another first cousin was Kaiser Wilhelm II. Why would Germanroyalty give such support to Hitler, a corporal in the First World War? If it is correct thatAlbert became Hitler, then the ‘Führer’ would have been much older than the age heclaimed to be. Picture evidence suggests that, in fact, Hitler was considerably older thanthe official account. His mistress, Eva Braun, described him to her sister as “an elderlygentleman of uncertain age”. Let me emphasise that I am not saying that any of thesetheories are true because I don’t know, but if you look in the picture section at the side-by-side shots of Hitler and Albert taken 25 years apart, you will see one reason why suchrumours persist. They look remarkably similar when you take the 25 years into account.Maybe it’s all coincidence, but if you know any more about this, I would be very keen tohear from you. See the address to send information at the back of the book.The esoteric became a consuming passion for Hitler, especially in his rise to power. Hewas strongly influenced by the work of Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, who was born in theUkraine in 1831 and later, one reliable researcher told me, became an agent for BritishIntelligence. Other researchers claim she had connections with the secret society of Italianrevolutionaries, the Carbonari, who were closely linked to the Black Nobility, and she wasa member of the Egyptian society, the Brotherhood of Luxor, which she later denounced as“a den for disgusting immorality, greediness for selfish power, and moneymaking”.Madam Blavatsky arrived in New York in 1873 and, with the help of a Colonel HenryOlcott, she founded the Theosophical Society two years later. This is still around today.The Theosophical Society’s headquarters in America were in California at Krotona. ThePythagorean mystery school in ancient Greece was at Crotona. Blavatsky’s society was yetanother mystery school derivative. Its doctrines are based on Blavatsky’s books such asIsis Unveiled, which was written in 1877, and The Secret Doctrine, published in 1888,which are themselves based on the Hebrew Cabala. She claimed to be in psychic contactwith hidden masters or supermen. These hidden masters, she said, lived in central Asia andcould be contacted telepathically by those who knew the secret to the esoteric mysteries."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"240Today we call this process of communication ‘channelling’. There are many UFOsightings and much research which indicate that there are secret underground andunderwater bases for extraterrestrials around the world, central Asia among them. Thisconnects with the endless legends and ancient traditions all over the world of a MasterRace living within the Earth. The belief in the Masters and the Great WhiteBrotherhood of discarnate entities promoted by people like the Theosophical psychic ofthe post-Blavatsky period, Alice Bailey, is a theme that remains well entrenched in whatis known today as the New Age movement. Alice Bailey founded the Arcane esotericschool. She claimed to ‘channel’ an entity she called the ‘Tibetan’ and she produced anumber of books including Hierarchy Of The Masters, The Seven Rays, A New GroupOf World Servers, and New World Religion. Bailey said that her Tibetan Master had toldher the Second World War was necessary to defend the plan of God. That soundsridiculous to me, but there are many in the New Age field who believe that everythingis part of ‘the plan’ and the will of God, even a global holocaust. It seems like a greatexcuse to do nothing and a cop out of mega proportions. We create our own reality andif we change our inner self we will change its outer reflection. Inner peace = outerpeace. Wars don’t have to happen as part of some plan of God. We create them and ifwe change our inner self, our attitudes, we can stop creating them. It’s just a choice. Myown view is that the Masters, the Great White Brotherhood, and this whole concept issomething to be deeply wary of. Whenever I hear the term ‘Master’ I cringe.Two organisations spawned by Alice Bailey’s work, the Lucis Trust (formerly theLucifer Trust) and the World Goodwill Organisation, are both staunch promoters of theUnited Nations. They are almost UN ‘groupies’, such is their devotion. It is interestingto see how the New Age has inherited ‘truths’ over the decades in the same way thatconventional religion has done over the centuries. As the followers of Christianity haveinherited the manipulated version of Jesus, so New Agers have inherited the Masters.There is too little checking of origins, too much acceptance of inherited belief, I think.Certainly there is with the Masters and Blavatsky’s Great White Brotherhood becauseshe admitted in correspondence with her sister, that she had made up their names byusing the nicknames of the Rosicrucians and Freemasons who were funding her. Yettoday all over the world there are hundreds of thousands (at least) of New Age‘channellers’ who claim to be communicating with these Masters and with theArchangel Michael who is an ancient deity of the Phoenicians. If the New Age isn’tcareful, it will be Christianity revisited. It is already becoming so.I believe that theconcept of Masters can be a means through which those who have rejected the statusquo of religion and science can still have their minds controlled.Another big influence on Hitler was the novel, The Coming Race, by theEnglishman, Lord Edward Bulwer-Lytton (Comm 300), a British colonial ministerheavily involved in imposing opium addiction on the Chinese. He was a closefriend of the British Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, and the writer, CharlesDickens, and was Grand Patron of the English Rosicrucian Society, which includedFrancis Bacon and John Dee among its earlier membership. Bulwer-Lytton was also"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"241a Grand Master of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry and the head of BritishIntelligence. One of his operatives was Helena Blavatsky, a contact told me, andBulwer-Lytton is often referred to in her book, Isis Unveiled. He is best known for hiswork, The Last Days Of Pompeii, but his passion was the world of esoteric magic. InThe Coming Race, he wrote of an enormous civilisation inside the Earth, well ahead ofour own. They had discovered a power called ‘Vril’ which, by the use of the psyche,could be used to perform ‘miracles’. These underground supermen would, according toBulwer-Lytton’s novel, emerge on the surface one day and take control of the world.Many Nazis believed this. The themes of underground supermen, or hidden masters,can be found in most of the secret societies and in legends across the world. Certainlythis was true of the Order of the Golden Dawn, formed in 1888 by Dr Wynn Westcott, aFreemason, and S.L. Mathers. They called their Masters the Secret Chiefs. Thissupports the ancient and modern theme of extraterrestrials or inner-Earth races livingunderground. Mathers devised a series of rituals and initiations designed to help hismembers access their full psychic and physical potential. He believed, however, thatthis gift was only for the few and he was a supporter of authoritarian government. Theserituals would have attracted the extreme negative energies which allowed vibrationalsynchronisation - possession -with the reptilians or other lower fourth dimensional‘astral’ entities which reside there. This is one of the main reasons for such black magicinitiations, to plug in the initiate’s consciousness to the reptilians and others in thelower fourth dimension. In the mid 1890s, there were temples of the Order of theGolden Dawn in London, Edinburgh, Bradford, Weston Super Mare, and Paris, whereMathers made his home. The Golden Dawn also spoke of the Vril force and one of theirsecret signs was the pointed-arm salute which the Nazis used when saying “HeilHitler”. It was yet another source of the esoteric foundations on which Nazism wasbuilt. Mathers had known Madam Blavatsky and so had the Master of the Order’sLondon Temple, the poet William Butler Yeats, who would go on to win a Nobel Prize.Remnants of the Order of the Golden Dawn continue to this day, but the originalversion splintered after a row between Yeats, Mathers, and the arch Satanist, AleisterCrowley, which split the membership into quarrelling factions. Other significant thinkersand groups which influenced the gathering Nazi philosophy included the Order of theOriental Templars (OTO), which used sex rituals to create and harness the energy knownas Vril, and two German esoteric magicians, Guido von List and Lanz von Liebenfels. Inhis summer solstice celebrations, List used wine bottles on the ground to form thesymbol of the Hermetic Cross, also known as the Hammer of Thor. It was the Badge ofPower in the Order of the Golden Dawn and we know this symbol as the swastika, theancient Sun symbol of the Phoenician-Aryans. Lanz von Liebenfels (real name AdolfLanz), used the swastika on a flag which flew over his ‘temple’ overlooking the Danube,and for these two black magicians it symbolised the end of Christianity and the dawningof the age of the blond-haired, blue-eyed, Aryan supermen. They believed in the racialinferiority of those they called the ‘dark forces’, such as the Jews, the Slavs, and theNegroes. Lebenfels recommended castration for these people. The two vons, List and"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"242Liebenfels, were to have a massive influence on Adolf Hitler. In 1932, with Hitler onthe verge of power, von Liebenfels would write to a fellow believer:“Hitler is one of our pupils... you will one day experience that he, and through him we, willone day be victorious and develop a movement that will make the world tremble.”1Two others who would influence the thinking and beliefs of Adolf Hitler were theEnglishmen, Aleister Crowley and Houston Stewart Chamberlain. Crowley was born inWarwickshire in 1875. He rebelled against a strict religious upbringing and was initiatedinto the Order of the Golden Dawn in 1898 after leaving Cambridge University. He left theOrder after the row with its founders and travelled to Mexico, India, and Ceylon, where hewas introduced to yoga and Buddhism. He also became a record-breaking mountaineer.Buddhism replaced his interest in the occult until an experience in Cairo in April 1904.Crowley was asked by his wife, Rose, to perform an esoteric ritual to see what happened.During the ceremony she entered a trance-like state and began to channel the words of acommunicator. “They are waiting for you” she said to Crowley. The “They”, she said, wasHorus, the god of war and the son of Osiris, in ancient Egyptian belief. Crowley did notaccept any of this and asked his wife a series of detailed questions in an effort to trick her.But Rose, who apparently knew little of the esoteric, gave the correct answer every time,according to the official story. The reptilians were on the line again. The communicatortold Crowley to be at a desk in his hotel room between noon and one oclock on threespecific days. He agreed and in these periods he wrote, via automatic writing, a documentcalled the Book Of The Law. Automatic writing is when your arm and hand are guided byanother force and often no-one is more surprised at what they are writing than the personinvolved. Crowley’s communication said that the old age of Osiris was being replaced bythe new age of Horus. But it said the old age would first have to be destroyed by barbarismand the Earth bathed in blood. There would be a world war, he was told. The Book Of TheLaw taught of a race of supermen and condemned the old religions, pacifism, democracy,compassion, and humanitarianism. “Let my servants be few and secret: They shall rule themany and the known”, the ‘superman’ continued. The message went on:“We have nothing with the outcasts and the unfit; let them die in their misery, for they feelnot. Compassion is the vice of kings; stamp down the wretched and the weak; this is thelaw of the strong; this is our law and the joy of the world... Love one another with burninghearts; on the low men trample in the fierce lust of your pride in the day of your wrath...Pity not the fallen! I never knew them. I am not for them. I console not; I hate the consoledand the consoler...“I am unique and conqueror. I am not of the slaves that perish. Be they damned anddead.Amen... therefore strike hard and low and to hell with them, master... Lurk! Withdraw!Upon them! This is the law of the battle of conquest; thus shall my worship be about mysecret house... Worship me with fire and blood; worship me with swords and with spears."},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"243Let the woman be gurt with a sword before me; let blood flow in my name. Trample downthe heathen; be upon them, 0 warrior, I will give you their flesh to eat... Sacrifice cattle, littleand big; after a child... kill and torture; spare not; be upon them!.”2The classic sentiments of the lower fourth dimensional reptilians and the Satanicrings which serve them. If all that sounds remarkably like some of the angry God stuffin the Old Testament, that’s because it was the same force which communicated to theancients, to Crowley, and to anyone else on that vibration who would help to stimulatethe conflict of human misery on which these reptiles feed. This is the force that controlsthe consciousness of those which have controlled the Babylonian Brotherhood sinceancient times. When you read that diatribe, you will appreciate the mentality that canset out to create the horrors which have plagued the human race. Crowley apparentlytried to ignore what he had written with his guided hand, but it would not go away, andfrom 1909 on he began to take it seriously. Very seriously. He said:“After five years of folly and weakness, miss-called politeness, tact, discretion, care for thefeeling of others, 0 I am weary of it. I say today: to hell with Christianity, rationalism,Buddhism, all the lumber of the centuries. I bring you a positive and primeval fact, Magicby name; and with this I will build me a new heaven and new Earth. I want none of yourfaint approval or faint dispraise; I want blasphemy, murder, rape, revolution, anything, bador good, but strong.”Crowley left his former tutor, MacGregor Mathers, a broken man as he embarked ona psychic war against him. They both conjured up ‘demons’ to attack the other, butMathers lost out. Such psychic wars are very much part of the Brotherhood armourytoday. They war psychically with each other, but overwhelmingly with the populationand people who are challenging their power. I have experienced such attacks myselfand I understand how they can kill people in this way. Crowley’s communicators wouldalso take over the psyches of Adolf Hitler and other architects of Nazism. Long after hisdeath, Crowley would become a hero to many involved in the Flower Power period ofthe 1960s, when the young were calling for love and peace. The irony is not lost.Crowley welcomed the First World War as necessary to sweep away the old age andusher in the new one. After going public with his revelations, Crowley was made theworld head of the Germany-based, Order of the Oriental Templars (OTO), and this gavehim very significant influence among like-thinkers in Germany. At the same time as heand his organisation were influencing the Nazis, Crowley was a 33rd degree ScottishRite Freemason and an agent of the British Intelligence operation, M16.3 He was anadvisor to his fellow Satanist, Winston Churchill.Houston Stewart Chamberlain (Comm 300) was born in England in 1855, but movedto Germany in 1882. In 1908 he married Eva, the daughter of Richard Wagner, andbecame a prestigious writer. His best known work was Foundations Of The NineteenthCentury which ran to 1,200 pages and sold more than 250,000 copies. It made him"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"244famous throughout the country. He was, however, a troubled man who had a series ofnervous breakdowns. He felt himself to be taken over by demons and his books werewritten in a trance and a fever, which suggests that he was locked into the reptilians oranother low vibrational consciousness via automatic writing. In his autobiography, hesaid he did not recognise such writing as his own. The themes of his work are veryfamiliar: all civilisation comes from the Aryan race and the Germans were the purist ofall; Jews were the enemy who would pollute the Aryan bloodlines (yawn). KaiserWilhelm II and Adolf Hitler said Chamberlain was a prophet. He became the principleadvisor to Kaiser Wilhelm and urged the king to go to war in 1914 to fulfil the prophecyof Germany’s world domination. When the war was over and Wilhelm had abdicated,he realised how he had been manipulated. Wilhelm gathered together a mass of bookson the occult and the German secret societies and he was convinced that they hadconspired to create the First World War and caused Germany to be defeated.Chamberlain, who had been awarded the Iron Cross by the Kaiser, died in 1927 afteryears in a wheelchair broken in body and spirit. This is something that often happens tothose who are used as vehicles and channels for this highly malevolent branch of thereptilian consciousness. It eventually destroys them. But Chamberlain’s influence wasto live on in the mind of Adolf Hitler. He had been introduced to Hitler by AlfredRosenberg, the refugee from Russia and another Satanist figure. It was Rosenberg,despite his ‘Jewish’ background, who gave a copy of the Protocols Of The LearnedElders Of Zion to Hitler via another occultist, Dietrich Eckart.4 The Protocols were usedby Hilter to justify his campaign against the Jews.These were some of the people and beliefs that moulded the thinking of the manclaiming to be a young Austrian called Schiklgruber, but later rather better known asAdolf Hitler. “Heil Schiklgruber” would not have had the same ring to it somehow. Hehated school, the official story goes, and wanted to be an artist, an ambition that tookhim to Vienna. He spent hours in the libraries reading books on astrology, mysticism,and the religions of the East. He was fascinated by the books of Blavatsky,Chamberlain, List, and Liebenfels and he picked out parts from each of them to producehis preferred mixture, a cocktail of horror and hatred called Nazism. His passion wasthe power of the will. The potential of willpower to achieve anything it desires was tobe his focus and guide throughout the years that followed. Put another way, creatingyour own reality. He practised the esoteric arts in his effort to access the level ofconsciousness he was convinced would turn him into one of the supermen he had readso much about and believed in so much. His psyche became locked into the reptilianvibration more powerfully than before. He was possessed, probably during some blackritual which opened his psyche to the reptilians. You only have to look at his beliefs tosee that he would have had great potential for ‘vibrational compatibility’ with thisconsciousness. It was now that an uncharismatic and ineffectual man would begin toexude the charisma and magnetism that would captivate and intoxicate a nation.We talk of some people having magnetism and ‘magnetic personalities’ and that isexactly what they have. We are all generating magnetic energies. Some people transmit"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"245powerful magnetism and others less so. Negative energies are just as magnetic aspositive. Those connected to, and therefore generating, the extreme negative vibration,will be very magnetic. You often hear highly negative people described as having amagnetic personality or a ‘fatal attraction’. This is why. It is also where the magnetismand charisma of Adolf Hitler suddenly appeared from. When he was standing on apublic platform, with that contorted face and crazed delivery, he was channelling thereptilian consciousness and transmitting this vibration to the vast crowds. This affectedthe vibrational state of the people and turned them into equally crazed agents of hatred.It is the pied piper principle, using vibrational frequencies. As one writer said of Hitler:“His power to bewitch an audience has been likened to the occult art of the Africanmedicine man or the Asiatic shaman; others have compared it to the sensitivity of amedium, and the magnetism of a hypnotist. “5And Hermann Rauschning, an aide to Hitler, said in his book, Hitler Speaks:“One cannot help thinking of him as a medium. For most of the time, mediums areordinary, insignificant people. Suddenly they are endowed with what seem to besupernatural powers which set them apart from the rest of humanity. The medium ispossessed. Once the crisis is passed, they fall back again into mediocrity. It was in thisway, beyond any doubt, that Hitler was possessed by forces outside of himself - almostdemoniacal forces of which the individual man Hitler was only the temporary vehicle. Themixture of the banal and the supernatural created that insupportable duality of which onewas conscious in his presence... It was like looking at a bizarre face whose expressionseemed to reflect an unbalanced state of mind coupled with a disquieting impression ofhidden powers.”6Hitler appeared to live in perpetual fear of the ‘supermen’. Rauschning told howHitler suffered from terrible nightmares and would wake in terror screaming aboutentities who were invisible to all but him. Hitler once said to his aide:“What will the social order of the future be like? Comrade, I will tell you. There will be aclass of overlords, after them the rank and file of the party members in hierarchical order,and then the great mass of anonymous followers, servants and workers in perpetuity, andbeneath them again all the conquered foreign races, the modern slaves. And over andabove all these will reign a new and exalted nobility of whom I cannot speak... but of allthese plans the militant members will know nothing. The new man is living amongst usnow! He is here. Isn’t that enough for you? I will tell you a secret. I have seen the newman. He is intrepid and cruel. I was afraid of him.”7This is the society planned by the reptilians and their reptile-Aryan master race if weallow the New World Order to be introduced in the next few years. Hitler’s ‘secret"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"246chiefs’ are the reptilians and note the obsession with hierarchy and ritual, charactertraits of the R-complex or reptile brain. After Hitler moved to Germany, he spent a lot oftime in Bavaria, from whence Weishaupt’s Illuminati had sprung and he returned thereafter the First World War. That’s the official line, anyway. The following year, he cameacross a tiny and rather pathetic political party called the German Workers Party. Thiswas an offshoot of an esoteric secret society called the German Order, which wasfiercely nationalistic and anti-Jewish. Out of this order came other similar societies,including the infamous Thule-Gesellschaft (Thule Society) and the Luminous Lodge orVril Society. Hitler was a member of both. Vril was the name given by the Englishwriter, Lord Bulwer-Lytton to the force in the blood which, he claimed, awakens peopleto their true power and potential to become supermen. So what is the Vril force in theblood? It was known by the Hindus as the ‘serpent force’ and it relates to the geneticmake up of the body which allows shape-shifting and conscious interdimensionaltravel. The Vril force is, yet again, related to the reptile-human bloodlines. In 1933, therocket expert, Willi Ley, fled from Germany and revealed the existence of the VrilSociety and the Nazis’ belief that they would become the equals of the supermen in thebowels of the Earth by use of esoteric teachings and mind expansion. They believed thiswould reawaken the Vril force sleeping in the blood. The initiates of the Vril Societyincluded two men who would become famous Nazis, Heinrich Himmler and HermannGoering. Vril members were convinced they were in alliance with mysterious esotericlodges in Tibet and one of the so-called ‘unknown supermen’ who was referred to as theKing of Fear. Rudolph Hess,8 Hitler’s deputy Fuhrer until he made his ill-fated flight toEngland in 1941, was a dedicated occultist and a member, with Hermann Goering, ofthe Edelweiss Society, a sect which believed in the Nordic master race. Hessworshipped Hitler as the ‘messiah’, although how he could do this when the Fuhrer washardly blue-eyed and blond-haired is not clear. Hitler had the same problem in equatingthe two, but he would have found some ridiculous explanation for it, I’m sure. Theinner core of the Nazi secret society network was the Black Order which continuestoday and is reported to be the innermost circle of the CIA.9The German researcher, Jan van Helsing, writes in his book, Secret Societies Of The20th Century,10 of how the Vril and Thule societies believed they were correspondingwith extraterrestrials through two mediums known as Maria Orsic and Sigrun in a lodgenear Berchtesgaden in December 1919. According to Vril documents, he says, thesechannellings were transmitted from a solar system called Aldebaran, 68 light yearsaway in the constellation of Taurus where two inhabited planets formed the ‘Sumeran’empire. The population of Aldebaran is divided into a master race of blond-haired, blue-eyed, Aryans, known as Light God People and several other human-like races whichhad mutated to a lower genetic form due to climatic changes, the channellings said.11 Inexcess of 500 million years ago the Aldebaran sun began to expand so creating atremendous increase in heat. The ‘lower’ races were evacuated and taken to otherinhabitable planets. Then the Aryan Light God People began to colonise Earth-likeplanets after theirs became uninhabitable. In our solar system it was said that they first"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"247occupied the planet, Mallona, also known as Marduk, Mardek, and by the Russiansand Romans, Phaeton, which, they said, existed between Mars and Jupiter in what isnow the asteroid belt. This corresponds with the Sumerian accounts of the planet,Tiamat. The Vril Society believed that later this race of blond-haired, blue-eyedAldebarans, colonised Mars before landing on the Earth and starting the Sumeriancivilisation. The Vril channellers said that the Sumerian language was identical to thatof the Aldebarans and sounded like “unintelligible German”. The language frequencyof German and Sumerian-Aldebaranian were almost identical, they believed.12 Thedetails may change in each version, but here we see the same basic theme yet again. Ablond-haired, blue-eyed master race of extraterrestrials land on the Earth from Marsand become the gods of ancient legend. They become the inspiration behind theadvanced Sumerian culture and spawned the purest genetic stream on the planet. Thesesame gods control the planet ever since from their underground cities. What I think hasbeen missed, however, is that within the Aryan stream are the reptilian-Aryanbloodlines. I know from Brotherhood insiders that the reptilians need the blood forsome reason of the blond-haired, blue-eyed people, and the Nazi obsession with theMaster Race was designed to keep this stream pure and discourage interbreeding withother streams and races.The Thule Society was named after Ultima Thule which is claimed to be themythical city on Hyperborea, the first continent settled by the extraterrestrial Aryan racefrom Aldebaran, they believed. Some say this was long before Atlantis and Lemuria,others say Hyperborea was Atlantis or even the inner-Earth. Scandinavian legenddescribes Ultima Thule as a wonderful land in the far North where the Sun never setsand the ancestors of the Aryans have their home. When Hyperborea started to sink, thelegend goes, the Aryan extraterrestrials used their highly advanced technology toburrow gigantic tunnels into the Earth’s crust and they settled under the HimalayanMountains. This realm became known as Agharta with a capital city called Shamballah,the Thule advocates believe. The Persians called this area Aryana, the land of theAryans. The Nazi belief system claimed that the people of Agharta were good and thoseof Shamballah were evil. The two had been in conflict for thousands of years and theNazis believed they were backing the ‘good guys’ of Agharta against the ‘Freemasonsand Zionists’ of Shamballah. Could this division be Aryan Martians v Anunnakireptilians, as an age old conflict between the two continues? First they battled on Mars,apparently, then the Moon and now Earth. Hitler was obsessed with finding theentrances to this subterranean world so he could contact the Aryan master race, but thetruth is that he was a reptilian puppet controlled by the ‘Angel of Death’, JosefMengele. It is highly likely, as I mentioned early on, that the reptilians are in conflictwith other extraterrestrial or inner-terrestrial races for control of the planet and therewill certainly be many competing factions in the consciousness cesspit of the lowerfourth dimension. A founder of the Thule Society was Rudolf Glauer, an astrologer,who changed his name to the grand-sounding Baron von Sebottendorff. His demandsfor a revolution against Jews and the Marxists turned the Thule Society into a focus for"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"248the anti-Jew, anti-Marxist, German master-racers. Out of all this came the GermanWorkers Party which would one day become the Nazi Party. Another committedoccultist and friend of Sebottendorff now becomes highly significant. This was DietrichEckart, a heavy-drinking, drug-taking writer who believed he was here to pave the wayfor a dictator of Germany. He met Hitler in 1919 and decided he was the one, the‘messiah’, he was looking for. It is Eckart who is credited with Hitler’s advancedesoteric knowledge and probably the black magic rituals which plugged him socompletely into the reptilian frequency. From now on, Hitler’s power to attract supportgrew rapidly. Eckart wrote to a friend in 1923:“Follow Hitler! He will dance, but it is I who have called the tune. We have given him themeans of communication with Them. Do not mourn for me; I shall have influenced historymore than any other German.”13Another of Hitler’s obsessions was the so-called Spear of Destiny, the weapon allegedto have been used to pierce the side of ‘Jesus’ at the crucifixion. He stole what is claimedto be the spear when the Nazis annexed Austria in 1938 and it was taken to Nuremberg.The legend says that whoever has this spear and decodes its secrets will have control of theworld for good or evil. The one that Hitler stole is now in the Hofburg Museum in Vienna,where there was a major fire in November 1992, seven days before the blaze whichdestroyed part of Windsor Castle. Heinrich Himmler was another dedicated occultist whowas into all matters esoteric. He used this knowledge in the blackest of ways. Himmler wasparticularly interested in the rune stones, a system of divination in which stones carryingsymbols are thrown or selected and the choice or combination ‘read’ by an ‘expert’. It wasHimmler who formed the notorious SS and, as with the swastika, he chose an esotericsymbol for his horrific organisation and this was the double S or sig rune which looks liketwo flashes of lightning. The SS was a virtually self contained body and the epitome of allthe esoteric knowledge in which the Nazis believed so passionately. Only those consideredracially pure were allowed to join, and instruction in the esoteric arts, including the runestones, was fundamental to their training. The SS was run and governed as a black magicsecret society. Their rituals were taken from others such as the Jesuits and the KnightsTemplar. The highest ranking initiates were the 13 (here we go again) members of theGrand Council of Knights led by their Grand Master, Heinrich Himmler, and the blackrituals were performed at the ancient castle of Wewelsberg in Westphalia. They celebratedthe rituals of the Nordic Pagans and the summer solstice. Here they worshipped Satan,Lucifer, Set, whichever name you prefer. Prince Bernhard, one of founders of theBrotherhood front, the Bilderberg Group, and an extremely close friend of Prince Philip,was in the SS. Black magic and the esoteric arts pervaded all that Hitler and the Nazis did,even down to the use of pendulums on maps to identify the positions of enemy troops. Theoriginal swastika Sun symbol was right handed which, in esoteric terms, means light andcreation, the positive. The Nazis reversed it to symbolise black magic and destruction.This is the classic reversed symbolism of Satanism which does precisely the same. The"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"249inverted pentagram is but one example. The mass rallies that Hitler used so effectivelywere designed with the knowledge of the human psyche and how it can be manipulated.In the book, Satan And Swastika, Francis King says:“Hitler’s public appearances, particularly those associated with the Nazi Party’s NurembergRallies, were excellent examples of this sort of magical ceremony. The fanfares, militarymarches, and Wagnerian music, all emphasised the idea of German military glory. The massswastika banners in black, white, and red, filled the consciousness of the participants in therally with national socialist ideology. The ballet-like precision of the movement of theuniformed party members, all acting in unison, evoked from the unconscious, the principlesof war and violence which the ancients symbolised as Mars. And the prime rituals of therallies - Hitler clasping to other banners the ‘blood banner’ carried in the Munich Putsch of1923 - was a quasi-magical ceremony designed to link up minds of living Nazis with thearchetypal images symbolised by the dead national socialist heroes of the past. The religio-magical aspects of the rallies were emphasised by the fact that their high points werereached after dusk and took place in a ‘Cathedral of Light’ - an open space surrounded bypillars of light coming from electric searchlights pointed upwards to the sky. If a modern ritualmagician of the utmost expertise had designed a ritual intended to ‘invoke Mars’ he couldnot have come up with anything more effective than the ceremonies used at Nuremberg.”And what applied then, applies now, the esoteric knowledge used by the Nazis formass hypnosis on the German people, is being used today to expand the globalhypnosis on the human race. Symbols, words, colours, sounds and techniques of whichthe public are not even aware, are being used in the media and advertising to hypnotiseus. The propaganda ministry of Joseph Goebbels was based on the esoteric knowledgeof the human psyche. He knew that people will believe anything if you tell them oftenenough and if you can engineer events which create the ‘something must be done’mentality in the public mind. He used colours, symbols and slogans, to great effect. Theslogans were used like mantras and repeated over and over again, hypnotising the masspsyche. All alternative views and information were censored and the people wereprogrammed to respond as desired. What is the difference between that and the constantdrip, drip, drip, of inaccurate and biased information that is fed to us and our childrentoday? It may not have a swastika on it, but it is still mass hypnotism. It would seem tobe a contradiction that Hitler sought to destroy secret societies like the Freemasons andto prevent the use of esoteric knowledge in German society, but it isn’t. He knew asmuch as anyone the power available to those with the understanding, and he wanted tokeep that for himself. In 1934, all forms of fortune telling were banned in Berlin andlater esoteric books were banned throughout Germany. Secret societies were disbandedand even the Thule Society and the German Order (which had together foundedNazism) were targeted. Astrologers were attacked and killed and people like Lanz vonLiebenfels were prevented from publishing their work. This purge had two mainmotives: to distance Hitler and the Nazis from the occult in the minds of the public and"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"250other countries and, most importantly, to pull up the ladder and stop anyone else fromusing esoteric knowledge against them as they were using it against others. This is amirror of the tactics of the reptile-Aryans throughout known history as they have usedthe knowledge to control and suppress while creating the religious dictatorships to takethe same knowledge out of public circulation. In truth, the Nazis were created andcontrolled at every level by the secret society underground and, ultimately, by thereptilians. They believed the Sumerian gods were the extraterrestrial master race; theybelieved in the existence of Atlantis; and they launched expeditions to North Africa,Rennes-le-Chateau and Montsegur in Cathar country, and to Tibet, where they believedthe underground supermen were based. There is a positive Buddhist stream of beliefand a highly negative one. The Nazis connected with the latter and when the Russiansarrived in Berlin at the end of the war they found many dead Buddhist monks who hadbeen working with the Nazis.The hollow EarthThe Nazis also believed that the Earth was hollow with entrances at the poles and anumber of researchers report that they established an underground base in Antarcticatowards the end of the war which is still in operation today. I have no doubt from theevidence I have seen that the Earth is hollow, or, at the very least, there are vastregions inside where highly developed civilisations live. I also feel that there areancient societies living under the ground between the Earth’s surface and the inner‘hollow’ centre. It is like three levels of peoples living on and within the same planet.The writer, Jules Verne, was a high initiate of the secret society network with hisconnections to the Theosophical Society, the Order of the Golden Dawn, and the Orderof the Oriental Templars. Therefore, he knew far more than the public are allowed toknow. His science-fiction stories were based on fact. He wrote of the two moons ofMars before they were identified (officially) in 1877. Verne’s epic, Journey To TheCentre Of The Earth, was not entirely a fantasy. He knew the basis of it was true.Those who promote the idea of a hollow Earth say that water flows from one polarentrance to another and in the centre of the planet is a vast sea and an inner central sun’which provides the heat and light. In the film version of the Jules Verne story, which Iwatched again recently, the scene is depicted in the same way. Interestingly, the mainopposition Verne’s explorers face are from massive reptiles, one of which they foundin the sunken city of Atlantis. There has been speculation, supported by muchevidence, that dinosaurs may have survived the cataclysm of 65 million years ago byliving within the Earth, particular in the Southern polar regions. Tom Rich, apalaeontologist at the Museum of Victoria, Australia, suggested this possibility after hediscovered the fossilised remains of a polar dinosaur in 1987 in an excavated tunnel onthe Southern tip of Victoria state at a place known as Dinosaur Cove.14 Jules Verne, ahigh initiate, would have known the true background and so much truth is passed onthrough symbolism in ‘fiction’ stories and movies. Steven Spielberg’s films are primeexamples, particularly the Indiana Jones series and, I feel, Jurassic Park in which"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"251DNA is manipulated to create reptilian dinosaurs. My view is that human DNA wasmanipulated to create reptilian-humans.There is certainly plenty of evidence that there are civilisations living within theEarth and even that the Earth is hollow. These are more themes of ancient knowledgeand traditions. Humans have become such puppets of the official line that to suggest theEarth is not solid to the core is to invite enormous ridicule. After all, isn’t that at oddswith what those highly intelligent scientists say? Yes it is, just as it was to suggest theEarth was round and not flat. When you research this subject you realise how littleevidence the scientists produce for their indisputable ‘facts’. They have penetrated onlya few miles into the Earth and their theories of what exists at deeper levels are just that -theories. When you ask a few questions of the official line, it is soon a stuttering wreck.For example: The very spin of the planet creates centrifugal force which throws matterto the outside, very much like a spin dryer in which the clothes spin around a hole in thecentre. When the planet was in its molten form, spinning into existence before it cooled,how could it possibly remain solid to the core? It is against all logic and laws of force,and if you look at Figure 23 you will see from the drawing of Donati’s Comet from1853 how matter is hurled to the outside to spin around the bright core or ‘sun’. TheEarth is basically the same. Researchers of the hollow Earth have suggested that theouter crust goes down some 800 miles and beyond that the planet is hollow. People liveon the other side of the very land that we live on. If you think that is impossible thenask why people in Australia don’t fall off the Earth even though they are on theopposite side of the surface to those in the northern hemisphere. The answer is that theyare pulled to the land by gravity. So are those who live inside the Earth. The force ofgravity pulls towards matter and so those on both sides of the planet’s landmass, insideand outside, will be pulled by gravity towards the land and neither will ‘fall off’. TheFigure 23: A drawingof Donati’s comet in1853 showing how thedisintegrating mass isthrown outwards bycentrifugal force to‘orbit’ a central energvsource. This leaves theinterior hollow in thesame way that clothingspins around a hollowcentre in a washingmachine or spin dryer.Surely this would havehappened when theEarth was formingalso?"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"252centre of the Earth’s gravity isnot at the core of the planet,but at about 400 miles down...the centre of the outer landmass and so gravity pullsequally on both sides (seeFigure 24).The alleged openings at thepoles make sense because thepower of centrifugal force inthe period of formation wouldhave been far less in thoseareas. At about 70 to 75degrees north and southlatitude, the Earth starts tocurve into the polar openingsto the inner Earth, supportersof this theory suggest. It is sogradual that people who claimto have experienced this hadno idea they were entering theinner Earth until they began tosee land that did not appear on the maps. These openings are an estimated 1,400 milesacross and around them is a magnetic ring. The entrances are covered by clouds most ofthe time, advocates claim, and the airspace is restricted by law. When explorerssearching for the North or South Pole reach this magnetic ring their compasses pointstraight down and they believe they are at the pole. They are not. They are at themagnetic ring which encircles the poles. The light and warmth inside the Earth comefrom an inner ‘sun’, it is claimed. Marshall B. Gardner, one of the best knownadvocates of a hollow Earth, believed that this ‘sun’ was created from the originalcentral fiery core around which the forming Earth was spinning, very much like thepicture of Donati’s comet. If the Earth is hollow, so it must be that the other planets,formed in the same way and subject to the same laws, would be hollow. How manycivilisations live within these planets while humans only look for life on the surface?Some other questions for the solid-to-the-core advocates: Why are icebergs made offresh water when the only water available at the poles, according to the conventional view,is sea water? Where does all the vegetation come from that is found inside these icebergs?Why is it that explorers who have ventured beyond the magnetic poles have found that theweather gets warmer and the seas become ice-free? Why do some animals and birds in thenorth polar region, like the musk-ox, migrate north in the winter? The conventionalscientific view cannot answer these questions, but the hollow Earth view can. There arefresh water rivers which flow out of the inner Earth and this warm water, carryingFigure 24: The inner earth as some researchers believe it to be.Hollow in the centre with an inner central sun and water flowingbetween the polar openings.

There are some books which reveal the detailed evidence ofthe inner Earth in much greater detail than I have space to do here and I can recommendThe Hollow Earth by Dr Raymond Bernard as an excellent summary of this evidence.15One man famously flew into the inner Earth at the North Pole in 1947 to a distance1,700 miles beyond magnetic north and the South Pole in 1956 to a distance of 2,300miles beyond magnetic south. He was Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd, a well-knownfigure in the United States Navy. He called the land he found: “that enchanted continentin the sky” and “the land of ever lasting mystery”16 In 1947, Byrd and his passengersbroadcast live on the radio as they flew inside the planet and they saw the ice of thenorthern regions replaced by ice-free lands and lakes and mountains covered with trees.They described strange animals resembling mammoths and the land they saw does notappear on any map to this day. After the initial publicity, information about the Byrdexpeditions was suppressed and he died in 1957, the year after his trip to the Antarctic.Two years later in December 1959, Ray Palmer, the editor of Flying Saucers magazinepublished an issue detailing Admiral Byrd’s discoveries, but when the truck arrivedfrom the printer with that edition, all the magazines were missing. Palmer called theprinter, but he was told there was no shipping receipt to prove the shipment had beenmade and when he asked for the edition to be reprinted he was told the printing plateshad been so badly damaged this was not possible. Palmer believed that UFOs came notfrom space, but from the inner Earth and that was part of his article in that ill-fatededition. I think he could have been right and the ancient Indian epic, Ramayana,describes Rama as an emissary from Agharta arriving in a flying vehicle.The legends of inner Earth peoples and blond-haired, blue-eyed master races, can befound in countless ancient cultures including China, Tibet, Egypt, India, Europe, theAmericas, and Scandinavia. William E Warren in his work, Paradise Found, Or TheCradle Of The Human Race, suggests that humans originated on a tropical continent inthe Arctic, a land of sunshine where a race of gods lived for more than a thousand yearswithout growing old. Warren connects this northern paradise with the ancient Greekconcept of Hyperborea. The Eskimos, who may originate from inner Earth peoples,have legends which tell of a paradise island to the north, a beautiful land of perpetuallight where there is no darkness nor extremes of sunlight, a place where people live forthousands of years in peace and happiness. You find the same in Irish myth also. It wasto the inner Earth, legends say, that some of the fleeing Lemurians and Atlanteanssheltered at the time of great geological turmoil and flood on the surface. Plato wrote ofmysterious passageways in and around the Atlantean continent, “tunnels both broad andnarrow, in the interior of the Earth.”17 He also described the great ruler “who sits at thecentre, on the navel of the Earth... the interpreter of religion to all mankind”18 TheRoman writer, Gaius Plinius Secundus, better known as Pliny, refers to undergroundpeoples who had fled from Atlantis and there are the legends of the inner Earth dwellerscalled the Troglodytes who, Pliny said, have hidden in their tunnels a great, ancienttreasure.19 Such stories abound in every culture."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"254The Nazi flying saucersStories also abound of ‘flying saucer’ craft built by the Nazis before and during the warunder programmes controlled by the Thule and Vril Society. German researcher, Janvan Helsing, and many others, have detailed some of the technology which wasproduced after 1934, including the Vril-1 fighter, Vril-7 (see picture section), and theHaunebu 1, 2 and 3.20 These and others were known collectively by the Allies as theFoo Fighters. Wendelle C. Stevens, a US airforce pilot in the Second World War andnow a UFO investigator, says that the Foo Fighters were sometimes grey-green,sometimes red-orange. They approached his aircraft as close as five metres and thenjust stayed there, he said. They could not be shaken off or shot down and caused manysquadrons to either turn back or land.21 Helsing includes photographs of these craft andother researchers support this information. I am always very wary of photographs ofthis kind because they can easily be faked and circulated until they become accepted asfact, but there is a documentary video, UFO - The Secrets Of The Third Reich, and theresearcher and lecturer, Vladomir Terziski, also includes a wealth of material on thissubject. The German flying saucers, apparently, had many technical problems andlimitations which were ironed out after the war. In 1938, according to a number ofresearchers into these subjects, a German expedition to the Antarctic, was led by theaircraft carrier, Schwabenland, and a 600,000 kilometre region of ice-free mountainsand lakes were declared Germany territory.22 It was called Neuschwabenland (NewSwabia) and became a massive Nazi military base. In 1947 there is said to have been astrange naval mission to the Antarctic by Admiral E. Byrd, the man who flew into theinner Earth at both the North and South Poles. He took with him 4,000 soldiers and afully equipped aircraft carrier. After eight weeks and high casualties, they pulled out,some researchers claim. What happened remains a mystery, but Byrd would later saypublicly that it was the bitter reality that in the case of a new war, one had to expectattacks by planes that could fly from pole to pole. He added that there was an advancedcivilisation in Antarctica, and together with the SS, they used advanced systems oftechnology.23So why didn’t the Nazis win the war? Well firstly, it seems there was conflict betweenthe Nazi secret societies and secondly, the ‘flying saucer’ technology was still far fromperfected. But the simple answer to why the Germans did not win the war is that theywere not meant to. The reptilians of the lower fourth dimension were manipulating them,yes, but they were working through the other sides also. They wanted a war and so theymanipulated all parties to achieve it. As I document and source at length in .. And TheTruth Shall Set You Free, the Nazis were funded by the classic bloodline families whowere also funding the Allies ‘opposing’ Hitler. The Rothschilds were at the heart of this,once again working through their vehicles in England, the United States and Germany.Standard Oil, controlled by the Rockefellers, was, in effect, the same company as I. G.Farben, Hitler’s chemical giant which operated the concentration camp at Auchwitz. I. G.Farben was the heart of the Nazi war machine and it was technological knowledgetransferred to them by Standard Oil which allowed Hitler to fight the war. This included"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"255the know-how necessary to turn the vast German coal reserves into oil. Other oilsupplies were provided for Germany by Standard Oil through the Brotherhood financialcentre and stronghold, Switzerland. The President of Standard Oil, New Jersey (nowExxon), was William Stamps Farish, a close friend of Hermann Schmitz, the chairmanof I. G. Farben. Farish’s grandson, William Farish III, is one of the inner circle aroundGeorge Bush and also entertains the Queen of England and Prince Philip at his home.Farish and the Queen breed their horses together. Bush’s father, Prescott Bush, thestalwart of the Skull and Bones Society, was one of the funders of Hitler. This was donethrough a subsidiary company called the United Banking Corporation (UBC) of whichPrescott Bush was a director and leading light. The UBC connected the W. A. HarrimanCompany of New York (Brown Brothers, Harriman, after 1933) with the businessnetwork of Fritz Thyssen, the German steel entrepreneur and banker, who funded Hitlerfrom the 1920s. The Harriman operation, like the J. P. Morgan and Rockefeller empires,was bankrolled by the Payseurs and the Rothschilds. Meanwhile, the Rothschilds werealso in control of Hitler’s I. G. Farben.Among those on the board of Farben’s US subsidiary, American I. G., was PaulWarburg, the Payseur/Rothschild trustee and agent who was sent to the United Statesto introduce the Federal Reserve banking scam that came to fruition in 1913. Hisbrother, Max Warburg, was Hitler’s banker until he left Germany without a problem in1938 and settled in the United States. Other funders of Hitler included GeneralElectric, which had close financial connections to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, thePresident who ‘opposed’ Hitler; the Ford Motor Company under Henry Ford who wasawarded Germany’s highest honour conferred on non-Germans, the Grand Cross of theGerman Eagle; and International Telephone and Telegraph (ITT) , which, in collusionwith Hitler’s personal banker and SS officer, Baron Kurt von Schroder, also bankrolledthe Nazi war effort. Master-minding this coordinated support was Montagu Norman(Comm 300), the governor of the Rothschild-controlled Bank of England. Norman wasan associate of Hjalmar Schact, who would become Hitler’s financial advisor andpresident of the German Reichsbank. These two were so close that Schact named oneof his grandsons after Norman. When the Nazis invaded Czechoslovakia, Normanreleased six million pounds worth of Czech gold to Hitler which was deposited inLondon. Incidentally, the two signatures on the document confirming Schact’sappointment as president of the Reichsbank on March 17th 1933, were Adolf Hitlerand the Rothschild frontman, Max Warburg. Most ‘Jewish’ people think that familieslike the Rothschilds and the Warburgs, who both claim to be Jewish, are on their side.Nothing could be further from the truth. As I mentioned earlier, the trail of the goldand money stolen by Swiss banks from German Jews during the war also leads back tothe Rothschilds.The Rothschilds and their associates the Rockefellers, Harrimans, and Bushs, werealso behind the Nazi race purity programme. Of course they were. Hitler’s race purityexpert was Dr Ernst Rudin, a psychiatrist at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Genealogyand Demography in Berlin. There he occupied an entire floor with his research and it"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"256was all made possible by funds provided by... the Rockefellers.24 It was these samefamilies who funded the eugenics movement which is pledged to remove the lowergenetic blood streams and leave only those of superior stock. Eugenics today often goesunder the title of ‘population control’. The best known of the population controlorganisations is Planned Parenthood which began life under another name at theLondon offices of the British Eugenics Society. No wonder George Bush has takenevery opportunity to pump vast amounts of American and United Nations money intothat organisation. Bush and Henry Kissinger are advocates of Thomas Malthus, theFreemason of the Darwin bloodline, who died in 1834. Malthus called for the culling ofnon-white peoples and for those white people of ‘lesser’ stock. Malthus and hiseconomist friend, the Freemason, John Stuart Mill, said that the Aryan race, the blond-haired, blue-eyed people, was God’s gift to the world. The gods’ gift, more like. Thehigher stock of the white race had to control the ‘ignorant’ dark skinned races, this pairsaid. Now that is no different from the Nazi philosophy or that of the British andAmerican establishment because they are from the same stream. Why have policiesbeen introduced in Africa, Central and South America, and Asia, which have causedsuch disease, death and destruction? It is part of an ongoing plan. You can read thedetailed background to the funding of Hitler, the role of the Rothschilds, and the masterrace-population control programme in .. And The Truth Shall Set You Free.Yet more confirmation that the same force controlled all sides in the Second WorldWar came with the British-American Intelligence operation called Project Paperdipwhich sprung the main Nazi leaders, scientists, engineers and mind control experts outof Germany before the allied armies arrived. They were transported to South Americaand the United States to continue their work for the reptilian Agenda. The Nazis whowere tried and hanged at the Nuremberg Trials were merely the pawns paraded beforea show trial to placate public anger. The kings, queens, bishops, and knights of theNazi regime escaped to continue their campaign against humanity via the networksarranged by their ‘opposition’, the United Kingdom and the United States. Among theNazis who escaped in Project Paperdip was the mass murderer and torturer, JosefMengele. The CIA was the creation of British Intelligence and particularly its Eliteinner circle known as the Special Operations Executive (SOE). The CIA replaced thewartime US intelligence organisation, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), whichwas born out of the Payseur empire intelligence operation. The OSS was headed byBill Donovan, a puppet of the Payseur-Rothschild-Rockefeller circle, and a formerclassmate of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Donovan’s law tutor at the Brotherhoodowned Columbia University was Professor Harland E Stone, who would later becomeUS Attorney General. Another of Stone’s proteges was J. Edgar Hoover, the 33rddegree Freemason and infamous head of the FBI at the time of the Kennedyassassination. Significantly, as I highlight at length in ...And The Truth Shall Set YouFree, a number of key operatives in the murder of President Kennedy were formerOSS agents posted to the British Intelligence headquarters in London during theSecond World War. Among them was Clay Shaw, the CIA asset who is the only man to"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"257be tried for his part in the Kennedy assassination, a trial featured in the film, JFK. Hewas cleared only because the main witnesses against him were murdered in the run upto his appearance in court. Shaw was an advisor to the Satanist and Rothschild clone,Winston Churchill, and, like all the OSS agents in wartime London, he danced to thetune of people like Lord Victor Rothschild, the unofficial string-puller of the BritishIntelligence network.The first Director of the CIA was Allan Dulles, a Nazi himself, as was his brother,John Foster Dulles, who was appointed Secretary of State. The Dulles’ are anotherBritish aristocratic bloodline. Both Dulles brothers were involved in Project Paperdip,as was Henry Kissinger,25 a ‘German Jew’, who answers not to Judaism, but toSatanism and his fellow reptilians. The Dulles’ were from a southern slave owningfamily and were cousins of the Rockefellers. The Dulles law firm, Sullivan andCromwell, handled the US affairs of I. G. Farben and Hitler’s major backer, FritzThyssen, introduced Allen Dulles to him. John Foster Dulles wrote “Heil Hitler” on hisletters to German clients and he was sent to Germany to negotiate new loans for theNazis on behalf of the Rothschild-Rockefeller Round Table group. The loans weremade to help the Germans pay back their war reparations which the same John FosterDulles had helped to impose as a member of the American delegation at the VersaillesPeace Conference in 1919. No wonder, then, that the CIA was created by Nazis, forNazis. Among them was Reinhard Gehlen, Hitler’s SS spymaster for the Russian front,who was appointed by Allen Dulles to set up the CIA network in Europe. The writerand researcher, Noam Chomsky, says that Gehlen formed a secret CIA-Nazi armywhich extended its operations to Latin America. It’s a similar story with theinternational police network called Interpol. The Nazi mentality didn’t lose the war. Itwas controlling all sides and after the carnage, it was business, or rather Agenda, asusual. Did Hitler die in the bunker? Of course not. Dr Robert Dorion, Director ofForensic Dentistry for the Ministry of the Solicitor General of Quebec in Montreal, hasfound glaring discrepancies between the photographs of the corpse’s teeth and thethousands of open-mouth shots of Hitler. The pattern of gaps between the teeth isdifferent. Hitler had a root canal and a porcelain tooth which the corpse did not, and thelower bridgework was very different.26After the war, the Nazi leadership simply exchanged their jackboots and tin helmetsfor smart suits and scientist’s overalls and the Agenda continued. Given this fact, doesanyone still believe that the controlling Nazi-Satanic core of the US Government wouldnot deliberately set out to burn children to death at Waco or blow them up at Oklahomain pursuit of their Agenda for global domination? This is the mentality that controls ourworld and five billion people are allowing it to happen. Only if they continue to do so,can the reptile-Aryan-Nazi mentality maintain it’s power over Planet Earth."},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"258SOURCES1Quoted by J. H.

But its basic structure and Agendaremains very simple.The centre of the operational web is the City of London with interlockingleaderships in places like France, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy and the UnitedStates. These are the spiders in the web with the City of London, ‘New Troy’, the mostimportant. From this centre the Global Agenda and policies are administered and their‘branch managers’ introduce those policies in each country. So if it suits the GlobalAgenda to crash the US dollar, the Mexican peso, the South African rand, or the FarEast stock-markets, the branch managers in those areas will take the action necessary todo that. The Brotherhood don’t suffer, indeed quite the opposite, because they knowwhat is coming. The major Brotherhood banks in the United States, like theRockefellers’ Chase Manhattan, increased their profits on the Mexican peso in 1991,the year the value of the peso collapsed, because they sold their peso holdings justbefore the crash. In 1987, the late billionaire financier and Rothschild relative, JimmyGoldsmith, sold all his holdings just before the world stock-market crash. Acoincidence, of course.At the heart of the web, or the top of the pyramid, whichever analogy you choose,are the reptilians. These operate mostly in the background from underground bases andoverwhelmingly by possessing the reptilian-human bloodstreams which resonate mostclosely to the reptile consciousness of the lower fourth dimension. These reptile full-bloods and reptile-possessed people hold the major positions of power in the world orwork in the background controlling those in the positions of apparent power like primeministers and presidents. Having a reptilian or reptilian-controlled human as presidentmight sound fantastic if you have allowed yourself to have your vision of possibilitysuppressed to the size of a pea, but when you see the evidence put together overthousands of years, it makes perfect sense of the ‘mysteries’ of history. People ask methe understandable question of why anyone would want to dedicate their lives to takingover a planet when they knew they were going to die long before it was achieved.Answer: The consciousness controlling that body is only using it as an overcoat, aspace suit, until it wears out. When that happens, it possesses another one. These samereptilians have been occupying the bodies of all the main players in the conspiracy"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"260going back to ancient times. Theobsession with interbreedingwithin the Brotherhoodbloodstreams comes from theneed to hold the reptilian geneticinheritance and thereforemaintain the vibrationalconnection between the humanbody on the third dimension andits controlling force on the lowerfourth. It was to hide this truththat they arranged for thedestruction of ancient historicalrecords, texts, and accounts overthe centuries as they ravaged andraped the native societies of theworld. The reptilians wanted todestroy all memory and records of their earlier open existence and control in the past. Ifthey could do that, humanity would have no idea that they were being controlledthrough physical bodies that look human by a fourth-dimensional force that is nothuman.The truth of what happened and continues to happen is held under the strictestsecrecy at the highest level of the secret society network and only a relative handful ofpeople know the story. Each section of the global pyramid is itself a smallercompartmentalised pyramid. These are like watertight compartments on a ship or, moreappropriately given its covert nature, a submarine. As above, so below. For example,the Freemason’s pyramid answers to a common leadership and then this leadership inturn answers to a higher one. The Illuminati degrees begin where the Freemasonsdegrees end so the 33rd degree of the Scottish Rite and tenth degree of the York Riteappear to be as far as anyone can go and for most Masons that’s true. But if someone isconsidered the right mentality and bloodline by the Brotherhood, they move on to thenext level, the Illuminati degrees or to another of the highly secretive inner-circlegroups like the Round Table which operate above the levels of the official secretsocieties like the Freemasons and the Knights of St John of Jerusalem (Malta). At theirpeak, the hierarchies of the secret societies fuse and connect with a common leadershipand at that level they are all the same organisation working to the same Agenda, despitetheir countless internal quarrels and conflicts.This secret society network places its trusted initiates into the most influentialpositions in the world of banking, business, politics, the media, the military, medicine,etc, and again at their highest levels, these apparently unconnected organisations andinstitutions fuse into the same pyramid peak and are controlled by the same people. It islike Russian dolls, one doll, or in this case, pyramid, inside another, until you reach theFigure 25: The pyramid of power in which all institutions ultimatelyfuse into the same tiny Elite. This allows the same Agenda to beorchestrated through all areas of society."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"261global pyramid which encompasses all of them (see Figure 25). The public faces ofthese organisations, and those who control them behind the scenes, might connect intothe network by being a Freemason, a Knight of Malta, an initiate of the Skull and BonesSociety, or as a member of a group of secret and semi-secret organisations called theRoyal Institute of International Affairs, the Council on Foreign Relations, theBilderberg Group, the Club of Rome, and the Trilateral Commission, which I willexplain more about in a moment. The point I am stressing here is that while all thesegroups have different names and apparently different aims, they are all the sameorganisation controlled in the end by the same leadership.The spiderThe secret societies and groups which form the vast web of interconnected operationsare an expanded version of the same network which goes back into antiquity. Someresearchers say that the upper hierarchy appears to consist of the Council of 3, theCouncil of 5, the Council of 7, Council of 9, Council of 13, Council of 33, the GrandDruid Council, the Committee of 300 (also known as the ‘Olympians’), and theCommittee of 500. Many groups have no name to avoid detection.1 I’m sure that thereis one, maybe two, people, sitting atop this pyramid, a sort of High Priest and HighPriestess of the world because, as I will expand on later, the most important hierarchy towhich all others are subordinate is the Satanist hierarchy. If you want to control thegame, you have to control all sides and this structure allows that to happen. TheBrotherhood control the ‘fors’ and the ‘againsts’ in politics, banking, business, themedia, and politics. They have agents in all governments and agents in the otherpolitical parties ‘opposing’ those governments; they have agents on both sides in warsand political conflicts; in the drug-running cartels and in the anti-drug agencies‘opposing’ those cartels; within the organised crime syndicates and the police andsecurity agencies ‘investigating’ those syndicates; within terrorist groups and theintelligence agencies ‘investigating’ those groups. Just because someone says he standsfor freedom and peace does not mean that he does. In fact, if he did he would not needto say it because it would be obvious. I have a simple rule. Anything that calls itself‘democratic’ stands for anything but. Look at the number of Democratic Fronts aroundthe world which spend their time imposing a dictatorship.The Round Table networkOne of the major networks is governed from the centre by the Round Table (see Figure26 overleaf). As we have seen, the Round Table has branches all over the world and in1920 and 1921 it added the Royal Institute of International Affairs (RIIA) and theCouncil on Foreign Relations (CFR) to its web. The RIIA itself created its ownoffshoots. The Council on Foreign Relations in New York developed its ownsubordinate network within the United States which connects the BabylonianBrotherhood with US government departments, Congress, media owners, editors,journalists, the tax-exempt foundations like the Rockfeller Foundation, universities,"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"262scientists, ambassadors, militaryleaders, ‘historians’, bankers, andbusiness people. Each major countryhas such a network which follows theAgenda dictated from the globalcentres in the City of London,Germany, France, and Switzerland. Iwas attacked in my absence once on aCape Town radio station by an‘astrologer’ who said that theconspiracy I am exposing could notexist because it could not be organisedover such a long period. As usual hehad not read any of my books or doneany research whatsoever beforedismissing the possibility and if hehad he would realise that, because ofthe structure I am describing, it is notonlv Dossible to follow the sameAgenda across the generations, it isperfectly straightforward. Why don’t big corporations or banks cease to exist when onegeneration of leadership retires or dies? Because the next generation takes over. Exactly.So it is with the Brotherhood and its Agenda. Perhaps the astrologer might consult hisown birth chart and identify the planetary conjunction which is closing his eyes to theobvious and the planet which impels him, like billions of others, to dismiss and condemninformation they have made no attempt to read, check, or understand.In May 1954 came the first official meeting of the next organisation in the RoundTable web, the Bilderberg Group (Bil), which was named after the Bilderberg Hotel inOosterbeek, the Netherlands, where that opening meeting took place. Or that’s theofficial story, anyway. Bil or Bel was also the Sun God of the Phoenicians. Bilderbergtranslates as ‘Bel of the rock’ or ‘Bel of the mountain’. The Bilderberg Group waschaired from 1954 to 1976 by Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, the former Nazi SSofficer and German spy working for the NW7 Intelligence department operatingwithin the unspeakable chemical giant, I. G. Farben, which ran the AuchwitzConcentration Camp.2 Pope John Paul II is said by some researchers to have workedfor I. G. Farben, also. It makes sense because the Brotherhood pick the Popes, ofcourse. Prince Bernhard, a German who married into the Dutch Royal Family, just asWilliam of Orange had done, is a reptilian blood relative and great friend of Britain’sPrince Philip. Together they launched the World Wildlife Fund, now the WorldwideFund for Nature (WWF). The last thing they were interested in was protecting wildlifeas we shall see in a later chapter. In 1968 came the Club of Rome, headed by theBilderberger and Freemason, Aureho Peccei (Comm 300), the number two at Fiat toFigure 26: The Round Table network."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"263the Black Nobility Bilderberger, Giovanni Agnelli.

The Rockefellers and the Rothschilds have playedthe environmental movement like a violin. The Club of Rome has used the environmentto centralise power and confiscate land. It claims to be campaigning to ‘save the planet’when in truth it is just another front for the Agenda intent on controlling the world and,what’s more, a front peopled by those who are demonstrably creating the veryenvironmental problems they say they wish to stop. The same applies to the so-calledClub of Budapest which is trying to do with ‘spirituality’ what the Club of Rome has donewith the environment. The Club of Budapest is headed by Ervin Laszio, an associate ofthe Club of Rome’s, Aureho Peccei. Another important Round Table satellite is theTrilateral Commission which was created by the Rockefellers in the United States in 1972and it has a role in the network of coordinating the Agenda between three parts of theworld, the United States, Europe and Japan. In .. And The Truth Shall Set You Free, Iexpose these organisations and their membership at great length, but for those who havenot read that book I’ll give you an idea of the scale of their influence on daily life andworld affairs. Whenever I mention someone who was, is, or would later become, amember of these groups, I will use the shorthand of RIIA, CFR, Bil and TC. I cannot atthis time tell you much about the modern membership of the Royal Institute ofInternational Affairs because it is so secretive and if anyone can help me with that I’d bemuch obliged. Some of their most important members I do know, however.These interlocking groups have among their number the top people in global banking,business, media, military, intelligence agencies, education, and politics. A look at someof the people who attended the first Bilderberg meeting in 1954 gives further indicationof the sort of people we are talking about. The chairman was Prince Bernhard, thehusband of Queen Juliana of the Netherlands (Comm 300), who has herself been aregular Bilderberg attendee. The present Queen, Beatrix, is another Bilderberg promoter.Other Bilderberg chairmen have included Sir Alex Douglas Hume (Lord Home), one ofthe Elite Scottish bloodlines and a former British Prime Minister, and another Britisharistocratic bloodline, Lord Carrington, who became chairman in 1991. More about himin a second. Prince Bernhard was head-hunted to be the Bilderberg chairman by LordVictor Rothschild, the spy, conman of colossal proportions, and one of the majormanipulators of the 20th century. Other attendees of that first meeting included: DavidRockefeller (CFR,TC); Deak Rusk (CFR, TC, Rhodes Scholar), the head of theRockefeller Foundation and Secretary of State under John E Kennedy; Joseph E.Johnson (CFR), head of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (War!) and USSecretary for the Bilderbergers; Denis Healey (TC, RIIA, Comm 300, Fabian Society),the British Labour Party Minister of Defence from 1964-1970 and Chancellor of theExchequer 1974-1979; and Lord Boothby, who worked with Winston Churchill on theunification of Europe, later known as the European Union."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"264NATO was a creation of the Brotherhood and is designed to evolve by stealth into aworld army by encompassing more and more countries and by manipulating ‘problems’which give it the opportunities to operate outside its designated area. The last fiveSecretary-generals of NATO alone have all been Bilderbergers, Joseph Luns, LordCarrington, Manfred Woener, Willy Claes, and Javier Solana. The head of the WorldBank, the Rothschild partner, James Wolfensohn, and a stream of his predecessors likeRobert Strange Macnamara, are Bilderbergers. So are the first two heads of the newWorld Trade Organisation, a Brotherhood creation which imposes heavy fines oncountries who seek to protect their people from the merciless global financial and tradingsystem. The first head of the World Trade Organisation was Peter D. Sutherland of Ireland(Bil, TC, Comm 300), the Director of the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade(GATT), Commissioner of the European Community (Union), and chairman of AlliedIrish Banks and Goldman Sachs. He later became head of British Petroleum (BP).Sutherland is an Elite clone make no mistake and he was replaced at the WTO by anItalian Bilderberger, Renato Ruggeno. Both the World Bank and the World TradeOrganisation connect with other global financial agencies like the International MonetaryFund and the G-7/G-8 group to impose their will and policies on developing countries inAfrica, South and Central America, and Asia, and to ensure they are controlled by thetransnational corporations which answer to the same overall leadership. The MultilateralAgreement on Investment (MAI) is another scam designed to dramatically increase theability of the transnational corporations to destroy a country’s economic base by imposingtheir will on the government and walking away with the profits while avoiding the tax andbusiness laws the other businesses have to face. The central banking network connectsinto the Round Table-Bilderberg operation. A number of heads of the Bank of Englandincluding Sir Gordon Richardson have been Bilderbergers and the same applies to theother central banks like the United States Federal Reserve, the cartel of private bankscontrolled from Europe which controls the US economy. The current head of the ‘Fed’ isAlan Greenspan (CFR, TC, Bil) and he replaced Paul A.Volker (CFR, TC, Bil). You getthe picture. Every few weeks in the United States and Britain, the media speculate on thepossible content of statements by Greenspan and the Governor of the Bank of England orthe Bundesbank about the state of their countries’ economies. These statements can, anddo, send the stock-markets rising and falling on the basis of what these people say If theyput interest rates up or down it can have a spectacular effect on the markets and people’slives. Who do you think controls these people and the statements they make? Exactly. Afriend of mine who invests heavily in the US markets began to study the investmentpatterns of the major corporations, banks, and insurance companies, in the periodimmediately before Bilderberger Greenspan was due to make his financial statements. Onevery occasion he found that the big players either massively buy or sell stock or bonds ofa specific kind in the three days before Greenspan speaks. And the statement made byGreenspan has, on each and every occasion, had a fundamental effect on precisely thestock or bonds the Brotherhood have bought or sold.

Interlocking with ‘gofers’ likeGreenspan and major players like the Rothschilds and Rockefellers, are ‘renegade’financiers such as George Soros (Bil) who simply follow orders. It was Soros who madebillions by attacking the British pound in September 1992, costing the peopleunbelievable amounts of money as the Chancellor of the Exchequer tried to defend thecurrency. Who was that Chancellor? Norman Lamont... Bilderberg Group. Soros did thesame to the Swedish currency with the same outcome. Who was the Swedish PrimeMinister at the time? Carl Bildt... Bilderberg Group. It was the fear of standing alonecaused by that Soros raid which turned a majority of Swedish public opinion to favourentry into the European Union, something most Swedes now appear to bitterly regret.The careers of so many politicians have taken off dramatically after they attendedBilderberg meetings. In the 1970s the career of the British Conservative Partypolitician, Margaret Thatcher, soared when she began to attend Bilderberg meetings andher election to Prime Minister was made certain in 1979 by the explosion of scandalsand strikes which brought down the Labour Government. A year later Ronald Reaganand George Bush were elected to the White House and they introduced exactly thesame extreme economic policies that Margaret Thatcher was doing under the nameThatcherism. It wasn’t Thatcherism at all, it was the Agenda unfolding as interest ratestook off to levels that crippled the Third World and made them ripe for therecolonisation programme through financial control. Also, the privatisation mania underThatcher-Reagan-Bush handed over state assets to the Brotherhood transnationalcorporations at knock-down prices. When Thatcher had outlived her usefulness she wasdumped, because everyone 15 expendable to the cause. In 1991, a relatively unknownGovernor for Arkansas called Bill Clinton was invited by David Rockefeller to theBilderberg meeting in Baden-Baden, Germany. A year later this man of British (BlackNobility) royal blood was President of the United States. In 1993, a British LabourParty Home Affairs spokesman called Tony Blair was invited to the Bilderberg meetingat Vouliagment, Greece, and a year later after the sudden and unexpected death of theLabour leader, John Smith, it was Blair who took over. From the moment thathappened, a series of scandals and conflicts destroyed the credibility of the rulingConservative Government of John Major making it certain that Blair would becomePrime Minister in a landslide victory in 1997. When I was on a speaking tour ofAustralia in early 1997, I predicted that not only would Blair be elected as PrimeMinister, the election would take place on May 1st because, going back to ancienttimes, that was a very important 4ay to the Babylonian Brotherhood. Examples of thisare the May Day fertility rituals and the also May 1st celebrations in the Brotherhood-created Soviet Union. The Bavarian Illuminati was officially formed on May 1st 1776.Tony Blair was such an important frontman for the Brotherhood that I just knew theywould bring him to power on May 1st. In Britain they do not have fixed termgovernments, the Prime Minister can call the election any time within five years ofcoming to power and so he is the one who officially announces the date.

From the moment he came to power, Blair and his Bilderberger Chancellor,Gordon Brown, began to introduce the Brotherhood Agenda for the Millennium years inBritain and Europe. This included conceding the government’s power to set interest ratesto the Bank of England, a move which happened within days of the election. Theeconomic policies followed by Bilderberger Brown were no different in fundamentals tothose of the previous Conservative Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, whom Brown replaced.This is not surprising because Clarke is also a Bilderberger and attended the meetingwith Tony Blair in Greece and again at Tumberry, Scotland, in May 1998. BrotherhoodLabour yes-man replaces Brotherhood Conservative yes-man as the official head of thenation’s finances and the only thing that changes is the name on the door. Britain, likeAmerica and virtually every other country in the world, is a one-party-state while thepublic go on thinking they are free because they have the right to put a cross on a pieceof paper every five years and choose the next Brotherhood puppet to run their country. Inthe United States, staggeringly, they vote electronically and this makes it so easy to rig.Tony Blair became an immediate bosom-buddy of Bill Clinton (CFR, TC, Bil) andthey speak with one (Brotherhood) voice. Blair’s ‘minder’ in the Labour Governmenthas been Peter Mandelson (RIIA), nicknamed the Prince of Darkness. He is one of themost important Brotherhood link-men within the British Labour Party and continues tobe so despite his resignation from the cabinet over a financial scandal. Incidentally itwas when Peter Mandelson took charge of the Labour Party’s image-making in the1980s that they changed their party symbol from the red flag to the classic Brotherhoodsymbol over the ages... the red rose. Chancellor Kohl of Germany is a Bilderberger andso were his predecessors, Brant and Schmit. Many prime ministers and leadingpoliticians in the Netherlands, including Ruud Lubbers, are Bilderbergers and it’s thesame throughout Europe with people such as Carl Bildt and the assassinated Olof Palme(Sweden), Uffe Ellemann-Jenson and Ritt Bjergegaard (Denmark). Jacques Santer, thehead of the European Commission, is a Bilderberger. He is the most important publicvoice in the European Union and he runs his centralised dictatorship with the stunningarrogance that Brotherhood initiates find so easy to manifest. European royalty isrepresented at Bilderberg meetings by the Dutch, Swedish, Spanish and British royalfamilies, or in truth: family. Lord Mountbatten, Prince Philip, and Prince Charles haveattended Bilderberg meetings.The “peace-keepers”When Brotherhood organisations use a word in their name they invariably mean theopposite. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace manipulates war and‘Democratic Fronts’ all over the world introduce dictatorships. It can be the same with‘peace-keepers’ and ‘peace negotiators’. Henry Kissinger goes around the world talkingabout “peace” and yet when he leaves a country all hell often breaks out. It’s not thathe’s a bad negotiator, he’s just doing his job for the Tribe.

But it was exposed, by design, to be ineffective and withhorrific pictures pouring from the television screens every night, the global cry was:“Something must be done, this can’t go on, what are they going to do about it.” That‘something’ offered by the very people who had engineered the war, was a 60,000-strong NATO world army, the biggest multinational force assembled since the SecondWorld War. It is in these circumstances that the Round Table network can be used toensure the right appointments. The first peace negotiator appointed by the EuropeanUnion in Bosnia was, yes, yes, Lord Carrington, chairman of the Bilderberg Group,President of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, Trilateral Commission member,and one of the Committee of 300. He was replaced by Lord David Owen (Bil, TC) andCarl Bildt (Bil), the former Swedish Prime Minister. The United Nations appointednegotiators were Cyrus Vance (Bil, CFR, TC) and the Norwegian, Thorvald Stoltenberg(Bil, TC). When their negotiations came to nothing, along came an ‘independent’negotiator, Jimmy Carter, the first Trilateral Commission President of the United States,and a CFR member. The cry of “Do something” got even louder as the horrors inBosnia continued unchecked and then came Richard Holbrooke (CFR, TC, Bil), thepeace envoy of Bill Clinton, who negotiated the Dayton Agreement which introducedthe NATO world army in Bosnia. Holbrooke answered to the then Secretary of State,Warren Christopher (CFR, TC), and the Defence Secretary, William Perry (Bil). Theyreported to the President, Bill Clinton (CFR, TC, Bil) who followed the orders of DavidRockefeller and Henry Kissinger, leading lights in the CFR, TC, Bil, and RIIA.

David Rockefeller, the long-time head of the Chase ManhattanBank and still unofficially in charge, was secretary of the Council on Foreign RelationsStudy Group which created the Marshall Plan for the reconstruction of Europe after theSecond World War. Marshall Plan funds were used to promote the European Union andto undermine the authority of the nation states. The man appointed to head the MarshallPlan in Europe was...

Hewas National Security Advisor to Jimmy Carter, the man David Rockefeller selected in1976 to become the first Trilateral Commission President of the United States. DavidRockefeller is the man behind all the presidents because he controls the money, media,and politics, to ensure that both presidential candidates answer to him.

If youcontrol the money, the media, and the party machines, you can put anyone you like inthe White House and you can get rid of them while they are still in office if that suitsyour agenda and timescale. This is why those who truly represent the interests of thepeople never reach the upper levels of politics. But it is not just in the United States thatthis is so. David Rockefeller has been the banker and puppet master of Russia and theSoviet Union, schooling and dictating to people like Mikhail Gorbachev and BorisYeltsin. Gorbachev, a reptilian shape-shifter, was used by Rockefeller and Kissinger tobring down the Soviet Union to allow those countries to begin the process of integrationinto the European Union and NATO.

Because he could not give a shitabout Jewish people, that’s why. They are just cattle to him like every other race, excepthis own, the reptilians. Kissinger is a Satanist, mass murderer, mind control expert, andchild killer. He arrived in the United States on September 5th 1938 and later became anaturalised American citizen. In 1972 the Polish KGB agent, Michael Goleniewski, toldthe British Government that KGB documents he saw prior to his defection in 1959included the name Henry Kissinger as a Soviet Union asset. According to Goleniewski,Kissinger was recruited by the KGB into an espionage cell called ODRA and was giventhe code name BOR or Colonel BOR. He built his power-base and ‘reputation’ atHarvard and he was on his way. As I reveal in detail in .. .And The Truth Shall Set YouFree, Kissinger has been the man behind all the presidents since Nixon, even though hehas not been involved officially.It was he who arranged for the Watergate scandal which removed Nixon and broughtin Gerald Ford (CFR, Bil) as President and Nelson Rockefeller, Kissinger’s crony andmentor, as vice-president. It was Nelson Rockefeller who advised Nixon to appointKissinger in the first place. The Watergate scandal was exposed by journalistsWoodward and Bernstein of the Washington Post, a paper owned by Kissinger’s friend,Katherine Graham (CFR, TC, Bil). I was approached by a scientist working for theBrotherhood against his will, who was ordered to a meeting at the White House duringthe Bush administration (1988-92). He was astonished to find Kissinger in the OvalOffice dictating events while Bush sat there and nodded. Kissinger had no official rolein the Bush administration to the knowledge of the American public and yet there hewas calling the shots. Kissinger’s ‘shuttle diplomacy’ consisted, and consists, ofmisrepresenting each side to the other, so sparking war after war.

Anothercasualty was the Italian P2 Freemason and banker, Roberto Calvi, who was hanged underBlackfriars Bridge near the City of London’s Square Mile in 1982 after the scandalbecame public. Carrington’s other business interests have included some familiar names,Rio Tinto Zinc, Barclays Bank, Cadbury Schweppes, Amalgamated Metal, British Metal,Christies the auctioneers, and the chairmanship of the Australian New Zealand Bank. Inhis book, The English Rothschilds, Richard Davis reports that Lionel Rothschild was afrequent visitor to the Carrington’s home in Whitehall. The two families are related by themarriage of the fifth Earl Rosebery to Hannah Rothschild, daughter of Meyer, in 1878.During the ceremony she was ‘given away’ as they say by Prime Minister Disraeli.Carrington, then, is of the Rothschild-British aristocratic reptilian bloodline. He has the"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"271perfect background and attitudes for a Brotherhood manipulator and he has beenappointed to perform many tasks for them. He was the British Foreign Secretary whoensured that power in the former Rhodesia was transferred from the white minoritygovernment of Ian Smith to the black dictator, Robert Mugabe, and things have gotworse, not better, for the people, exactly as planned. It was Carrington who resigned asForeign Secretary because of the ‘mistakes’ he made which led to the Falklands War in1982. You would have thought that he would have been kept well away from thingsmilitary after that, but no, from 1984 to 1988, he was the Secretary-general of NATOand in 1991 he became the chairman of the Bilderberg Group. While in that post, hewas appointed to be the first ‘peace’ negotiator in Bosnia.Control of the mediaThe names Rothschild, Rockefeller, Kissinger and Carrington appear on the boards and‘advisory’ boards of global media corporations and that’s no surprise. To control humanitythrough the mind and emotions you simply have to control the media. Without that it’simpossible. This is made so much easier because the overwhelming majority of journalistsin the world, including the so-called ‘big names’ in each country, are either agents for theBrotherhood (the small minority) or they don’t know their arse from their elbow when itcomes to understanding what is going on in the world. I’ve been a journalist and so I haveseen both sides and what is termed the communications industry is really the blind(journalists) leading the blind (their readers and viewers). My experience as a journalist,and as the target of journalists, has shown me very clearly how remarkably few brain cellsyou need to do the job. Every day on television stations all over the world, journalists andcorrespondents give their viewers the official version of the event they are reporting.“White House sources say this..., the Prime Minister says that..., the FBI say the other... “Inall my time in journalism I cannot recall a single conversation in a newsroom that didn’treflect the official version of life and the world. Most journalists are not manipulating, theyare simply stunningly uninformed and often incredibly arrogant. They believe that ifanything of magnitude was going on they would know about it because they are‘journalists’. In truth they are the last to know. Arrogance and naivete, the mentalcombination that produces so many journalists, is a telling and highly destructivecombination. Add a padlocked mind and you’ve got the job. One BBC interviewer said tome in all seriousness that we should be no more concerned about the membership of theFreemasons than we should the membership of the local squash club. I’m not kidding. Ihave given many journalists the story of what is going on and they have either dismissed itwithout even looking at the evidence or they have ridiculed the information withoutlooking at the evidence. I remember meeting a guy, I think his name was Taylor orsomething, in Los Angeles in early 1997. He worked for The Observer newspaper inLondon. I told him about the paedophile activities of George Bush and his drug runningoperation. I offered to put him in touch with some of those who had been abused by Bush.What did this ‘journalist’ do? He went away and wrote an article making personal attackson me, including the fact that my eyes appeared bloodshot. Not surprising after a non-"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"272stop speaking tour of Australia, New Zealand and the United States over a period of twomonths, but how can anyone write about the state of someone’s eyes when they arebeing offered, as he put it himself, the “Story of the century”? Because he’s a journalist,that’s why I offered to put the British Sunday People in contact with similar sources, butthey didn’t want to know. As the old saying goes: “You cannot bribe or twist the greatBritish journalist, but seeing what they will do unbribed, there’s no reason to.” Ofcourse there are journalists who are exceptions, and honourable ones, but they are so, sorare and ask them what happens when they try to write the story as it really is.Journalists dance to the official tune and become the copy typists and town criers forthe official version of life. They are the ‘gofers’ for those higher up the media pyramid. Atthe top are bankers who provide the funds to buy the media groups. These bankers alsocontrol the major industries and business networks and the newspaper, television, andradio operations cannot survive without the advertising revenue from these people. Thethreat to stop advertising has led to many an expose of the truth ending up in the bin.Below the bankers and industrialists come the media ‘barons’, the Murdochs, Blacks,O’Reillys, and Packers. They toe the line of the funders and advertisers and they appointtheir editors to make sure that the same policy appears in the papers and broadcast mediaday after day. The editor appoints the journalists and they have to follow the same line theeditor has been told to follow. The journalist answers to the editor, the editor answers to theproprietor, and the proprietor answers to the banks and the corporations - the Brotherhood.This is what we call ‘news’. We are led to believe that the great media egos like Murdoch,Packer, and Ted Turner don’t like each other. Maybe that’s true and maybe its asmokescreen, it doesn’t really matter. Whichever of them heads an organisation, the samepolicy prevails, so the Brotherhood could not care less which of their puppets owns anewspaper because their policy will be followed whatever. These ‘barons’ are not incontrol. They are frontmen, that’s all. Look at Ted Turner, the Council on ForeignRelations member who was supposed to be taking on the system with his Cable NewsNetwork (CNN). He sold out to Time Warner, one of the greatest Brotherhood operationson the planet, and CNN pounds out the official line hour after hour, day after day. Whensomeone genuinely wants to start a television station or newspaper to tell the truth, theycan’t get advertising or funding or they have their share price undermined via theunimaginable amounts of money the Brotherhood banks, corporations, and insurancecompanies move around every day. This opens up such media operations to a hostiletakeover. The three television networks in the United States, CBS, ABC, and NBC arecontrolled by members of the Round Table network and so are the Washington Post, LosAngeles Times, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and a long, long list of others. Thesame goes for country after country.Two of the lesser known groups which make the point about control of the media areHollinger Inc. and ‘Independent’ Newspapers. Hollinger owns 68% of newspapers inCanada and more than 250 papers and magazines worldwide, including major USpapers, The Jerusalem Post, and Telegraph Newspapers in London. Hollinger is a frontfor British Intelligence. During the last world war, an Elite section of British"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"273Intelligence called the Special Operations Executive formed a front organisation calledWar Supplies Ltd under the leadership of two British agents, George Montagu Black andEdward Plunkett Taylor. It was Taylor who later wrote the banking laws for the Bahamasand the Cayman Islands. After the war this British Intelligence company continued underthe name of the Argus Corporation and more recently it changed its name again toHollinger. Today it is headed by Conrad Black, the son of the British spy, GeorgeMontagu Black, who set it up in the first place. Conrad Black is a member of the innersanctum of the Bilderberg Group. His father was close to the Bronfman gangster familywho, like the Kennedys, made a fortune from running illegal booze during theprohibition the Brotherhood themselves had introduced. The Bronfmans today own theliquor giant, Seagrams, as well as a substantial drug running operation. On the ‘advisory’board of Hollinger are Henry Kissinger, Lord Carrington, and Edmund de Rothschild!Independent Newspapers is owned by the Irish billionaire and former rugby player, TonyO’Reilly. It includes newspapers in Ireland, Britain, France, Portugal, Mexico, SouthAfrica, and New Zealand. The South African President, Nelson Mandela, spentChristmas 1993 at O’Reilly’s holiday home at Nassau in the Bahamas and soonafterwards the Irishman bought the Argus group, South Africa’s biggest newspaperchain.4 This is now a mouthpiece for Mandela’s African National Congress (ANC). Since1994, O’Reilly has bought 60% of the Argus Group, 43% of Newspaper Publishing inBritain, 55% of Australian Provincial Newspapers, 25% of Irish Press Newspapers, and44% of Wilson and Horton the largest newspaper group in New Zealand.5 He also hasextensive interests in cable television in Ireland, and radio and television in Australia andNew Zealand. His acquisitions will go on and money will be no object because for all hisself-promotion he is just a puppet. His Sunday Independent in Ireland devoted an eightpage supplement to him called “A Man For All Continents” and it included seventeenphotographs of him with his friends... Henry Kissinger (Bil, CFR,TC, RIIA, Comm300), Margaret Thatcher (Bil), Valery Giscard D’Estaing (Bil), and Robert Mugabe. Oneof O’Reilly’s close friends in Ireland is the former Prime Minister, Garret Fitzgerald (Bil,TC).6 O’Reilly also idolises Churchill, apparently. His friendship with the Zimbawedictator, Robert Mugabe, began while O’Reilly was still chairman of Heinz and Mugabewill still put a giant-sized can of Heinz beans on his head to amuse visitors to the StateHouse.7 In 1992, Mugabe joined O’Reilly at his mansion in County Kildare, Ireland, andthese two Jesuit-educated initiates celebrated high mass in a medieval private chapelbuilt around a crusader’s (Knights Templar) tomb.8 O’Reilly and his business associateshave since bought a 60% stake in Associated Newpapers of Zimbabwe (ANZ) with theintention of launching a new English language daily.9The Agenda todayThe control and manipulation of the media and the other institutions which directhuman thinking and perception is not only to achieve power for power’s sake, there is amuch bigger reason for it. The Agenda is for the complete takeover of the planet by thereptilians without anyone realising that it has even happened. They are well on their"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"274way to achieving this unless people wake up. The basic structure is designed around aworld government which would take all the major decisions in the world (see Figure27). This would control a world central bank, currency (electronic, no cash), and army.All this would be underpinned by a microchipped population linked to a globalcomputer. Under this structure would come three superstates - the European Union, theAmerican Union, and the Pacific Union (Asia, Far East, Australia). This edifice ofpower would dictate to the current nation states which are planned to be broken up intoregions to dismantle any unified response to the structure I’ve described. It would, quitesimply, be a global fascist dictatorship and we are so close to this unless there is arevolution of thinking among the mass of humanity. The network I have summarised inthis chapter allows for this Agenda to unfold because there are Brotherhood agentsworking within all the political and economic groups needed to make it happen. Themore global problems that can be created, the more pressure there will be for globalsolutions - the centralised control. The second tier, the ‘unions’ of superstates, is well onthe way.The Superstate ‘Unions’The European Union with its central bank and single currency has been evolved from afree trade area called the European Economic Community or Common Market. Therewas no mention of the superstate when we joined, but that was always the Agenda andit has been achieved by the stepping stones approach: moving towards the goal step bystep with very few realising where these steps are heading. Had Adolf Hitler won thewar he had an economic design for Europe he called it the Europaische Wirtscraft =Figure 27:The structure theBabylonian Brotherhood isseeking to introduce earlyin the new Millennium."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"275gemeinschaft. This translates as... the European Economic Community! Hitler lost thewar, at least on the surface, but we got the same policy anyway because it was part ofthe Agenda. If I summarise how the European Union has been engineered and thepeople and organisations behind it, you will see how the hidden hand operates and bemore aware of the tactics being employed to do exactly the same in the Americas, thePacific region, and Africa. A United States of Europe under centralised control was theaim of the Knights Templar way back in the 12th and 13th centuries and under theirdifferent names and incarnations this same force has achieved that target via theFreemasons, the Bilderberg Group, and others. The Bilderberg Group is particularlyimportant, however, in the creation of the present superstate. The men behind theformation of the European Economic Community on behalf of the Brotherhood wereJean Monnet (Comm 300), Count Richard N. Coudenhove-Kalergi (Comm 300) fromAustria, and Joseph Retinger (Comm 300), a Polish ‘socialist’ who helped PrinceBernhard to create the Bilderberg Group. Monnet, the son of a French brandy merchant,went to Canada in 1910 and there connected with the Hudson Bay Company, an oldBlack Nobility operation, and the Lazard Brothers Bank. He became a confidant topresidents and prime ministers, including Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and his influentialfriends gave him a very lucrative contract to ship materials from Canada to Franceduring the First World War. When the war ended he was appointed to the AlliedSupreme Economic Council and became an advisor to the group around Lord Milner(Round Table, RIIA, Comm 300) and Colonel Mandel House (Round Table, CFR,Comm 300) which was preparing the Treaty of Versailles and creating the League ofNations. Monnet was appointed the Deputy Secretary General of the League of Nationsand later vice-president of a company called Transamerica which was owned by thedrug-money-laundering Bank of America. Monnet was perfectly placed to be thepuppet through which other powers could manipulate into being the EuropeanEconomic Community. Count Richard N. Coudenhove-Kalergi wrote’ a book in 1923calling for a United States of Europe. He was named after Richard Wagner, of whomHitler had said that to understand Nazi Germany one had to understand Wagner. A closefriend of the Count’s father was Theodore Herzl, the founder of Zionism (Sionism - theSun cult). The Count’s book was called Pan Europa and he went on to form the PanEuropean Union with branches right across the continent, supported by leadingpoliticians and the Anglo-America Establishment, including Colonel House and HerbertHoover. The Count said in his autobiography:“At the beginning of 1924, we received a call from Baron Louis de Rothschild; one of hisfriends, Max Warburg (Hitler’s banker) from Hamburg, had read my book and wanted toget to know us. To my great surprise (sure!), Warburg spontaneously (sure!) offered us60,000 gold marks to tide the movement over for its first three years... Max Warburg, whowas one of the most distinguished and wisest men that I ever came into contact with, hada principle of financing these movements. He remained sincerely interested in Pan-Europefor his entire life. Max Warburg arranged his 1925 trip to the United States to introduce meto Paul Warburg and Bernard Baruch.”10"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"276The European Community, now Union, is another creation of the Brotherhood withall the old familiar names involved. Winston Churchill (Comm 300) was a supporter ofthe European superstate and he wrote an article in 1930 for the American publicationThe Saturday Evening Post, called “The United States of Europe”. A few years later hewould play his part in advancing the war which led to the creation of that very structure.Count Coudenhove-Kalergi was given enthusiastic backing from people like JohnFoster Dulles, Nicholas Murray Butler, the President of Columbia University and theCarnegie Endowment for International Peace (‘War’), and Dr Stephen Duggan, thefounder and first President of the Institute of Education which was 100% controlled bythe Council on Foreign Relations. The United States Congress passed seven resolutionson the political union of Europe and one of them stated: “The creation of a UnitedEurope must be regarded as an essential step towards the creation of a United World”(world government). Jean Monnet also headed the Committee for the United States ofEurope which had the same goal. Since the creation of the European EconomicCommunity (EEC) it has been evolved as planned, by the stepping stones method, tobecome the centralised fascist state it was always designed to be. Two admirers ofMonnet are Merry and Serge Bromberger, and they set out the plan in their book, JeanMonnet And The United States Of Europe:“Gradually, it was thought, the supranational authorities, supervised by the EuropeanCouncil of Ministers at Brussels and the Assembly in Strasbourg, would administer all theactivities of the continent. A day would come when governments would be forced to admitthat an integrated Europe was an accomplished fact, without their having a say in theestablishment of its underlying principles. All they would have to do was to merge all theseautonomous institutions into a single federal administration and then proclaim a UnitedStates of Europe.”11That is where we are now. Again you have the structure of the core few at the centredictating the overall plan and the interlocking networks in each country manipulatingtheir people and Parliament to follow that overall Agenda.The two Prime Ministers ofBritain before, during, and after our entry into the European Community were Labour’sHarold Wilson (Bil) and the Conservative Edward Heath (Bil, TC). They were both closeassociates of Lord Victor Rothschild and Heath made Rothschild head of his ‘policy unit’during his four years as Prime Minister between 1970 and 1974. It was in this period, in1972, that Heath signed the Treaty of Rome which ensnared the United Kingdom into theBrotherhood’s European spider’s web. Sitting beside Heath at the signing ceremony washis Foreign Secretary, Alec Douglas Hume (Lord Home), a chairman of the BilderbergGroup and a member of an ancient Scottish bloodline. The whole thing was manipulationon a vast scale. The ‘opposition’ Labour Party when we went into Europe under HaroldWilson (Bil) included in its leadership, Roy Jenkins (Bil, TC, RIIA), who would go on tobecome the President of the European Commission, James Callaghan (Bil, RIIA), andDenis Healey (Bil, TC, Comm 300), chairman of the International Monetary Fund"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"277Interim Committee and member of the council of the Royal Institute of InternationalAffairs. Healey was at the first Bilderberg meeting in 1954 and attended more of theirgatherings than any other British politician in his period in active politics. Good Old Denis,the man of the people? Excuse me. In this same period the leaders of Britain’s third party,the Liberals (now Liberal Democrats) were Jo Grimond (Bil) and Jeremy Thorpe, author ofthe book, Europe: The Case For Going In. I wonder when they were in the highestpolitical positions in the land, if Wilson, Heath, Jenkins, and Healey, ever got together andpondered on the remarkable twist of destiny which led four people, who attended OxfordUniversity in the same period, to become the leading political names of 1960s and 1970s,just as the United Kingdom was committing itself to membership of the EuropeanCommunity. Wilson (Jesus College, University College), Jenkins (Balliol), Heath (Balliol),Healey (Balliol), Grimond (Balliol), and Thorpe (Trinity College) are such an inspirationalexample of what can happen when you have an Oxford education. The fact that Oxford hasalways been a major Brotherhood centre and, with Cambridge, is a key recruiting groundfor manipulators of the next generation, is purely coincidental, of course.Heath, a shape-shifting reptilian, was manipulating Britain toward membership ofthe Community right through the 1960s and he was agreeing to the political union ofBritain in Europe as early as April 1962 when he was Lord Privy Seal. Before takingBritain into Europe, Heath attended a meeting in Paris in October 1972 to negotiate theconditions with the French President Georges Pompidou (Bil), a former employee ofGuy Rothschild. Douglas Hurd was the British Foreign Secretary who signed the fascistMaastricht Treaty in February 1992 which turned the European Community into theEuropean Union, the superstate. Hurd was a private secretary to Ted Heath between1968 and 1970 and his political secretary from 1970 to 1974 when Heath was PrimeMinister and signing Britain into Europe. Hurd was also Minister of State to LordCarrington in the run up to the Falklands War and it was Hurd who recommended an‘honorary’ knighthood for Henry Kissinger. Since that time influential and apparentlyopposing political figures like the Conservatives Ted Heath (Bil, TC), Kenneth Clarke(Bil), Geoffrey (Lord) Howe (Bil, Comm 300), the Labour Party’s Tony Blair (Bil),Gordon Brown (Bil, TC), and the Liberal Democrat leaders, David Steel (Bil, TC) andPaddy Ashdown (Bil), have pressed and argued for further and further erosion of Britishdecision making and the swamping of freedom by the centralised, bureaucraticEuropean Union. Blair has blatantly filled his ministerial team negotiating with theEuropean Union with people who want the UK to join the single bank and currency.Among them, before his resignation in a financial scandal, was our friend PeterMandelson, the man members of Parliament have dubbed: “the Prince of Darkness”. Atthe time of writing, the three major British political parties are headed by Tony Blair(Bil), William Haig (Bil), and Paddy Ashdown (Bil).We are being conned and the Brotherhood initiates at the top in the banks andcorporations have been activated to frighten the people into believing there will be aneconomic collapse if a country does not join the single bank and currency.

What I havedescribed in Europe is planned for the Americas, the Pacific region, and Africa. TheAmerican Union is designed to evolve from NAFTA, the North American Free TradeAgreement, and the Pacific Union from APEC, Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation, the‘free-trade area’ formed in 1994 after much campaigning by the Rhodes Scholar andformer Australian Prime Minister, Bob Hawke. NAFTA was negotiated between GeorgeBush (CFR,TC, Skull and Bones), the paedophile President of the United States, andBrian Mulroney, a rapist of mind controlled women, who was Prime Minister ofCanada. I’ll expand on their activities in a later chapter. Bush said when he signed thefree trade agreement with Canada and Mexico on August 12th 1992 that he wanted tosee NAFTA stretch from the tip of North America to the tip of South America. His‘opponent’, Bill Clinton, said at a gathering of leaders from throughout the Americas onDecember 10th 1994:“History has given the people of the Americas the chance to build a community of nations,committed to liberty and the promise of prosperity... early in the next century (I want tosee)... a huge free trade zone from Alaska to Argentina.”Other elements of the Agenda include the microchipping of the global population;the complete control of energy supplies, the destruction of alternative forms of healingthat expose established medicine as a fraud; and global marshal law.

In the ancient mysteryschools, drugs were widely employed to stimulate other states of consciousness and tomanipulate thought and perception.Opium, from which comes heroin, is the oldest narcotic we know of. References toits use have been found in the Sumerian Tablets going back maybe 6,000 years.1 TheSumerians called it the ‘joy plant’.2 It is also mentioned by the Egyptians and theGreeks in around 1,500 BC and 1,000 BC respectively. The opium poppy was such apart of Greece that they depicted it on their gold coins.3 Traces of hallucinogenic drugswere found in the grave of a South American Indian dating back 4,500 years and,throughout the ancient world, records of drug use can be found. Haomoa and Soma, thesacred drinks of the Zoroastrians and the Hindus, could well have been the mind-altering Amanita muscari mushroom, some believe.4 The chemicals from this pass intothe urine with hardly any loss of strength and the Hindu scriptures refer to a sacredurine drink as a source of enlightenment and insight. Certainly gives new meaning tothe phrase “Taking the piss”. The Aztecs used the hallucinogenic properties of thePsilocybe Mexicana mushroom in their religious rites and they called it “God’s flesh”.5I mentioned earlier the use of mushrooms by the Hebrew priests which even inspiredthe design of their headgear. The reptile-Aryan priests of Babylon were highly skilled intheir manipulation of the populace through drugs and this has continued in the secretsociety networks they spawned. The Rosicrucians expanded the use of mind-alteringdrugs and the Assassins possibly got their very name from the way they employeddrugs to mind control their killers. More than anything, drugs have been used by theBrotherhood throughout history to destroy societies so they can be easily taken over.This is precisely what is happening on a world scale today. But this policy is not new.Only the scale has changed.Most famously opium was the weapon used by the ‘British’ (the London-basedBabylonian Brotherhood) in the Opium Wars against China in 1840 and 1858.Chinese efforts to stop the flow of opium into their country were thwarted by themight of the British Empire. Queen Victoria’s Foreign Secretary and Prime Ministerduring the Opium Wars was Lord Palmerston, the Grand Patriarch or Master ofGrand Orient Freemasonry, and a member of the Committee of 300. ThePalmerstons were in fact the Temple family and their title goes back to 1723 when"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"281Henry Temple became Baron Temple of Mount Temple, County Sligo, Ireland andViscount Palmerston of Palmerston, County Dublin, an Irish peer. Temple originatesfrom Templar. This title was passed onto his grandson, also named Henry, who was amember of the British House of Commons for 40 years and it was he who owned apainting by the artist, David Teniers, called St Anthony And St Paul, with its mass ofsacred geometry, which has been connected by researchers to the coded manuscriptsand mysteries of Rennes-le-Chateau. Temple was living at the time at Broadlands inRomsey, Hampshire, later the home of Lord Louis Mountbatten. The Mountbattenfamily also bought the Teniers painting. It was the second Lord Palmerston’s son,Henry John Temple, who became the legendary Prime Minister, Foreign Secretary, anddrug runner for the British Crown in China. He married into the English aristocracythrough the sister of Lord Melbourne, the Prime Minister at the start of Queen Victoria’sreign, and went on to lead the Liberal Party, also known as the Venetian Party,overseeing the British forces in the Crimean War and the Opium Wars against China.He entered the House of Commons for the first time as the member of Parliament forNewport on the Isle of Wight, a name which recurs far more often than you wouldexpect for a small island off the south coast of England. Queen Victoria and PrinceAlbert had Osborne House built on the island, and this is where she spent much of hertime after Albert’s death. Lord Mountbatten would later be governor of the island. TheIsle of Wight is a significant centre for Satanism as well as being a most beautiful placeto visit. Another Brotherhood city is Edinburgh in Scotland, just down the road from theSinclair’s Rosslyn Chapel. Palmerston spent three years in Edinburgh lodging with theWhig Party philosopher, Professor Dugald Stewart, and Edinburgh University was acommon connection between the members of the Lunar Society and Charles Darwin.The Brotherhood chosen one, Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister elected on May 1st1997, was brought up in Edinburgh and went to Fettes, a private school there. His fatherwas a lecturer at Edinburgh University.The vehicle for the opium trade from India to China and elsewhere, was the East IndiaCompany, a group of Scottish merchants and Freemasons who were aligned with theKnights of St John of Jerusalem (Malta) and the Society of Jesus, the Jesuits. Someresearchers believe that the company’s real masters were the banking families of northernItaly, the Black Nobility, but by then they were centred in London, anyway. The strategyused by the British in China has become a blueprint for invasion-by-drug-addiction eversince. They sponsored a mass addiction to opium until Chinese society and vitality wastorn asunder. The British Government used a network of terrorism and organised crime,like the Triads, the Hong Society, and the Assassins to carry out the trade on their behalf.These secret societies which ruthlessly eliminate anyone, especially their own, who do notcarry out orders, are merely threads in the same global network that connects with theFreemasons. They are, again, different masks on the same face. The drug trade was (andis) organised by the Far East lodges of Freemasonry. The Grand Lodge of England(current Grand Master, the Queen’s cousin, the Duke of Kent) established lodges in Chinaat Amoy, Canton, Foochow, Swatow, Chefoo, Chinkiang, Hankow, Newchang,"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"282Tongshan,Wei-Hai-Wei, two at Tientsin, three in Shanghai, and five in Hong Kong.6When the Chinese rulers acted to stop the supply of opium, the British used theirmilitary and naval might to defeat them. And the ‘peace’ treaty after the conflict thengave the British a guaranteed right to increase the flow of opium; to be paidcompensation for the opium the Chinese rulers had confiscated; and to have sovereigntyover strategic ports and offshore islands and this is how Hong Kong came under Britishrule. It was used as the centre for Far East drug trafficking and that is still its role todayafter it has been returned to China. Most of the gold and money transactions on theHong Kong financial markets are the payoffs and money laundering of the drug trade.The Treaty of Nanking of 1842 gave Britain control over Hong Kong, plus about£15 million in silver. It was written by the Freemason and Colonial Minister, EdwardBulwer-Lytton (Comm 300), whose writings were to so inspire Hitler, the Nazis, andmystics like Madame Blavatsky. Bulwer-Lytton wrote of the Vril power (serpent power)in the blood of the ‘underground supermen’. Bulwer-Lytton’s son was the Viceroy ofIndia at the height of the opium trade between India and China, a period ‘camouflaged’by Rudyard Kipling’s writings about the British Raj (British drug runners). In the bookThe Opium Clippers, Basil Lubbock names the owners of the British vessels engaged inthe opium trade through the East India Company; Jardine Matheson (the ScottishKeswick family, many of whom are Satanists), Dent and Co; Pybus Bros; Russell andCo; Cama Bros; Duchess of Atholl; the Earl of Balcarras; King George IV (formerly thePrince Regent); the Marquis of Camden; and Lady Melville. It was Lady Melville’sancestor, George, who welcomed William of Orange to the throne and was made LordPrivy Seal as a reward. The Keswicks and Jardine Matheson have been members of theCommittee of 300. Other Anglo-American families involved in the drug trade were theSutherlands, Barings, and Lehmans, cousins of the Rothschilds. The Sutherlands, one ofthe biggest cotton and opium traders in the American south, were cousins of theMathesons, and the Barings banking family founded the Peninsular and Orient SteamNavigation Company (the famous British ferry company P & 0) to transport opium.The British reptilian bloodline families worked with their other American relatives toexpand the drug trade, as they still do today. The bloodline Russell family made itsenormous wealth from the opium trade in the nineteenth century through the drugsyndicate known as Russell and Company. Its business was to take opium from Turkeyand transport it illegally to China. Their only rivals were the Perkins syndicate, based inBoston, which had intermarried with other families of the British genetic lines who hadbeen involved in the slave trade. The Russells eventually bought out the Perkins andbecame the centre of the US opium racket in league with other reptilian families likeCoolidge and Delano (Comm 300), both of which produced Presidents of the UnitedStates. The head of Russell and Co in Canton while all this drug racketeering was goingon was Warren Delano Jr, the grandfather of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt whocomes from an aristocratic French bloodline. In 1986, a history of the drug trade inAmerica, printed in US News And World Report, said that: “Delano equated the opiumtrade with the liquor business - both profitable and both cornerstones of the family"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"283business.”7 How appropriate that Franklin Delano Roosevelt should be geneticallyrelated to George Bush who still maintains the tradition of running drugs on anenormous scale. Other Russell partners were John Cleve Green, who used some of hisopium fortune to finance Princeton University; Abiel Abbott Low, who used his opiummoney to finance the construction of Columbia University; and Joseph Coolidge, who’sson formed the drug running operation called the United Fruit Company. His grandson,Archibald Cary Coolidge, was a founding executive officer of the Council on ForeignRelations. The Russells with the Tafts formed the Skull and Bones Society and theblack flag with the white skull and cross bones was the corporate flag flown on allRussell Trust Company ships. It was also a flag flown on ships in the Knights Templarfleet. Another American connection to the opium trade was the Freemason, John JacobAstor, the founder of the Astor dynasty who became a stockholder in the British EastIndia Company.8 Philadelphia and Boston, the headquarters of the Northern Jurisdictionof the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, were (and are) other centres for the drug trade. Adescendant of Astor, Waldorf Astor of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York, was ahigh degree Freemason who became chairman of the Royal Institute of InternationalAffairs in London after the Second World War.9 The RIIA is extensively involved incoordinating the global drug trade (see the book, Dope Inc., in the bibliography).After the second Opium War which ended in 1860, the British merchant banks andtrading companies established the Hong Kong and Shanghai Corporation as the centralbank of the Far East drug industry. According to all research I have read about the drugnetwork, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, with its global connections, continues tobe a financial centre for the drug industry to this day.10 The Hong Kong and ShanghaiBank now calls itself HSBC Holdings since China regained Hong Kong and HSBCowns one of the four British clearing banks, the Midland. This had a long advertisingcampaign calling itself the “listening bank” and the “bank that likes to say yes”. Idon’t remember it mentioning the number of times its owners have said “yes” tolaundering the profits of the drug industry which is destroying the lives of so many.The Nugan Hand Bank (based in Sydney, Australia) was another CIA/Mossadoperation run by Francis Nugan and Michael Hand, a Green Beret and a colonel in theUS Army assigned to the CIA. Hand was in frequent contact with George Bush afterhis election to Vice-President of the United States, according to CIA operative, TrentonParker.11 Look at some principle officers of Nugan Hand Bank; Admiral F. Yates,president, the chief of staff for strategic planning of US forces in Asia and the Pacificduring the Vietnam War; General Edwin E Black, president of the Hawaii branch, thecommander of US troops in Thailand during the Vietnam conflict; George Farris,operative with the Washington and Hong Kong branches of Nugan Hand, and amilitary intelligence specialist; Bernie Houghton, the Saudi Arabian representative, aUS Naval Intelligence undercover agent; Thomas Clines, of Nugan Hand in London, adirector of training in the CIA’s clandestine service who was involved in theIran-Contra affair and operated with Michael Hand and Theodore Shackley duringVietnam; Dale Holmgreen, of the Taiwan office, flight service manager in Vietnam for"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"284Civil Air Transport, which later became the infamous CIA airline, Air America; WalterMcDonald, head of the Annapolis, Maryland, branch, the former deputy director of CIAeconomic research; General Roy Mannor, the Philippines branch, the chief of staff forthe US Pacific Command and the US government liaison with President FerdinandMarcos; William Colby, Nugan Hand’s lawyer, a former director of the CIA.12 Just thekind of people you would expect to be running a bank, eh? This was another drugoperation. A director of Nugan Hand, Donald Beazley, was also chairman of CityNational Bank of Miami, which handled funds for the Mossad-front, the Anti-Defamation League.13An Australian Government investigation revealed that millions of dollars in NuganHand records were unaccounted for and that it was serving as a money launderingoperation for drug traffickers. These profits were being used by the CIA to finance gunsmuggling and illegal covert operations around the world. There was also evidence thatthe CIA was using the bank to pay for political campaigns against politicians in manycountries, including Australia, to ensure the voters supported the CIA choice. Yes, thisis still the ‘free’ world we are talking about. Banks with household names across theplanet are vehicles for laundering drug money by passing it from account to accountuntil its origins are lost in the web of transactions. The gold and diamond industry,dominated by the Rothschilds and the Oppenheimers, through companies like De Beers,are also used to wash drug money. The money buys gold and diamonds from thosecompanies and they are then sold to produce ‘clean’ money. The network ofinterconnecting Anglo-American families in the Brotherhood web of manipulation,which has been responsible for the engineering of wars and for economic depressionthrough the generations, is also behind the world illegal drugs market. Some of the mostfamous names, merchant banks, and companies in the world, are making the bulk oftheir fortunes directly or indirectly from the drug addiction of the young. They are thesame families and organisations who were responsible for the slave trade from Africaand the ‘coolie’ trade out of China. The term ‘being shanghaied’ comes from thekidnapping of Chinese people for shipment to the United States to be used as servants.Alcohol prohibition was a means to create the massive network of organised crime inthe United States. The structure thus produced was perfect, as intended, for drugtrafficking once prohibition was over. The main groups campaigning for prohibition andan end to the ‘evils of drink’, groups like the Women’s Christian Temperance Union andits Anti-Saloon League, were financed by the Rockefellers, Vanderbilts, and Warburgs,via the Rockefeller Foundation, the Russell Sage Foundation, and similar tax-exemptfoundations. Prohibition was another con by the Brotherhood used for longer termmotives. Incidentally, it also made a fortune for Joseph Kennedy, the father of JFK.Professor Alfred McCoy’s 1972 classic, The Politics Of Heroin In South East Asia,and his 1991 update, The Politics Of Heroin - CIA Complicity In The Global DrugTrade, tell of how CIA helicopters in Vietnam were carrying drugs from the fields todistribution points, when the American public thought they were there to fightCommunism. He describes how a Pepsi Cola bottling plant was used for this trade and"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"285how the media suppressed this information. 58,000 Americans and goodness knowshow many Vietnamese were killed in that conflict and nothing sums up morepowerfully the lack of respect this mindset has for human life, than the way the CIAsmuggled drugs into America in plastic bags hidden in the body cavities of deadsoldiers being returned home from Vietnam for burial. CIA operative, GuntharRussbacher, has told how some bodies were gutted and filled with drugs for shipmentback to the States.14 The bodies carried secret codes which allowed those carrying thedrugs to be indentified on arrival at West Coast Air Bases, particularly the TravisAirforce Base in California. The drugs were then removed and made available to theyoung people of America.Heroin is a derivative of the opium poppy which also produces morphine, a nameinspired by the Greek god of dreams, Morpheus. It was at the Bayer laboratories inGermany in 1898 that heroin was created by adding ingredients to the morphinemolecule. Bayer would later be part of the I. G. Farben pharmaceutical cartel at the heartof Hitler’s war machine. Heroin is the most addictive of all opiate drugs, but it wasmarketed by Bayer as: “An heroic drug, without the addictive potential of morphine”.The name heroin comes from ‘heroic’ and its creators were indeed heroes to theBrotherhood, given the potential it had to cause untold strife and misery. Today the FarEast heroin trade is still organised by the Freemasons through their interconnectedagents, the Triads. These are the Mafia of the Far East and increasingly the WesternWorld also, as in Vancouver, Canada. Just to give you another example of the way thegame is played. The Chinese ruler before the Communist Revolution was Chiang KaiShek, a member of an earlier form of the Triads. The ‘Communist’ leader who toppledhim from power was Mao Tse Tung, a Grand Orient Freemason!15 He allowed the Britishlease of Hong Kong to continue (of course, he did, he was a Brotherhood placeman) andthe drug-business-as-usual continued. By 1983, the Communist Chinese had nine millionacres of poppy plantations and this is the foundation of the Chinese economy, just as it isfor the Western economy.16 Without the drug trade, the world economy would collapse,so dependent has it become on the income and investments produced by the destructionof human life. The Triads organise the production of heroin in the so-called GoldenTriangle. They are paid by the British Brotherhood bankers of Hong Kong in goldbullion and some of this is paid by the Triads to buy raw opium from the farmers. So theannual cycle goes on expanding. The cocaine trade out of South America is run by thesame people through their agencies like the CIA. Cocaine comes from the coca leaf and,until 1903, it was used in the drink, Coca Cola, hence its name. I detail the CIA’s role inthe cocaine networks and how they set up the Colombian drug cartels in .. And The TruthShall Set You Free. Also in that book you will find the background to the extensiveinvolvement of George Bush and Bill Clinton in these operations.The drug trade is not only about making vast amounts of money, although that isimportant to fund the Agenda into place, it is also designed to break down societies andstop young people manifesting their true worth and potential. When people are hookedon drugs they are not going to be a problem to the Brotherhood’s grand design."},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"286Violence and crime always follows the drug trade as drug dealers battle for supremacyand addicts mug and steal to finance their habit. This offers the Brotherhood awonderful opportunity to offer the ‘solution’ to this ‘problem’ -more power to the policeand further erosion of basic freedoms. I saw an opinion poll in the Los Angeles Times afew years ago in which something like 84% of those questioned said they would giveup basic freedoms if they thought it would win the war on drugs. Problem-reaction-solution. What those people urgently need to know is that the drugs are beingdistributed by those fronting the drug war, who are offering the ‘solutions’ at the sametime. Much of the ‘anti-drug’ network is deeply corrupt and used as a vehicle fordistributing drugs without detection. George Bush has fronted more wars on drugs thanany other American politician and yet he is one of North America’s premier drugbarons. A reporter on the San Jose Mercury News exposed the CIA’s involvement inputting crack cocaine into the black community of Los Angeles. This was during theperiod Bush was in the White House and both the journalist and the paper were hit by atidal wave of ridicule and abuse from the establishment papers like the Washington Postand the Los Angeles Times as the Brotherhood tried to crush the story. Even the runningof drugs comes down to bloodlines, by the way. A friend has a contact who was offeredthe job of being a drug courier by a US government agency. He refused, but asked whythey had approached him. “We know what your bloodline is,” came the reply. One ofthe codes, he found out, was to have your hand cut across the palm. If you are evercaught, you show the authorities your hand and they let you go.The anti-drug agencies are controlled by the drug cartels and when you hear of ‘bigdrug busts’, it is usually the Brotherhood eliminating the competition and giving theimpression of action. The drug pushers are difficult to find? Then how come ayoungster straight off the bus in a new city can find them in an hour? If you are takinghard drugs, or thinking of doing so, remember this: You are not being a ‘rebel’ or‘dropping out’, you are committing mental, emotional, spiritual and eventuallyphysical, suicide, and you are doing exactly what the people who control this worldwant you to do. The choice is yours, but understand the game before you start. There isonly one winner when you get into drugs.

It has been a seamless procession through history of the samerituals to the same deities and this remains of fundamental importance to the initiates ofthe Brotherhood today.My use of the term Satanism has nothing to do with the Christian version of Satan. Iuse it only to describe a system of ritual sacrifice and torture which, staggering as itmay seem to most people, is commonplace all over the world today. Satanism is justanother name for the worship of a highly destructive, negative force which has beengiven endless names over the centuries: Nimrod, Baal, Moloch or Molech, Set, theDevil, Lucifer, there is no end to them. Satanism perverts everything positive in thesame way that the Nazis took a positive symbol, the swastika, and turned it around tosymbolise the negative. This is why the Satanists invert the pentagram and why theyuse black to symbolise the darkness, hence their Black Mass. But they also reverse thesymbolism of white and that is a powerfully negative colour to them. The Satanicnetworks, under the names of their various deities, were created by the BabylonianBrotherhood to serve their needs. We have seen that the accounts of the Watchers andtheir offspring, the Nefilim, include references to their blood drinking activities. TheBrotherhood know that blood contains the life-force energy. Drinking menstrual bloodhas always been a feature of the reptilian bloodlines because they need blood to live inthis dimension. It was known as the Star Fire, the female lunar essence. The femalemenstrual cycle is governed by the cycles of the Moon and the blood contains thatenergy. It’s ingredients are supposed to ensure a long life. In India it was called somaand in Greece it was ambrosia, some researchers suggest. This was said to be the nectarof the gods and it was - the reptilian gods who are genetic blood drinkers. The ‘holygrail’ chalice or cup is also symbolic of the womb and drinking menstrual blood, as wellas being a symbol of the reptilian ‘royal’ bloodline itself. Menstrual blood was providedfor the Elite of the reptilian ‘royal’ line by virgin priestesses and this is the origin of theterm ‘Scarlet Woman’ or, to the Greeks, ‘Sacred Woman’. The Greek word for this,Hierodulai, was eventually translated into English as harlot and into German as ‘hores’,the origin of whore. The word ritual derives from this practice (ritu = redness) and so dothe words rite and red. Menstrual blood is one reason why the colour red is so important"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"289to Satanists and it is another reason for the constant use of the colour gold by the ‘royal’bloodlines. Gold is called the metal of the gods, but to the Anunnaki of the SumerianTablets, menstrual blood was the ‘gold of the gods’.The reptilians and their crossbreeds drink blood because they are drinking theperson’s life-force and because they need it to exist in this dimension. They will oftenshape-shift into reptilians when drinking human blood and eating human flesh, I amtold by those who have seen this happen. Blood drinking is in their genes and an Elitehigh priestess or ‘Mother Goddess’ in the hierarchy, who performed rituals for theBrotherhood at the highest level, told me that without human blood the reptilians cannothold human form in this dimension. Her name is Arizona Wilder, formerly Jennifer AnnGreene. Interestingly, she said that the reptilians had been pursuing the Aryan peoplesaround the universe, because the blood of the white race was particularly important tothem for some reason and the blond-haired, blue-eyed genetic stream was the one theywanted more than any other. They had followed the white race to Mars, she said, andthen came to Earth with them. It is far from impossible that the reptilian arrival on thisplanet in numbers was far more recent than even many researchers imagine. Aninterbreeding programme only a few thousand years ago between the reptilianAnunnaki and white Martian bloodlines already interbred with the reptilians on Mars,would have produced a very high reptilian genetic content. This is vital for the reasons Ihave explained earlier. They appear to need a particular ratio of reptilian genes beforethey can shape-shift in the way that they do. But when the interbreeding happened is farless important than the fact that it did happen.Satanism is based on the manipulation of energy and consciousness. These deeplysick rituals create an energy field, a vibrational frequency, which connects theconsciousness of the participants to the reptilians and other consciousness of the lowerfourth dimension. This is the dimensional field, also known as the lower astral to manypeople, which resonates to the frequency of low vibrational emotions like fear, guilt,hate and so on. When a ritual focuses these emotions, as Satanism does, a powerfulconnection is made with the lower fourth dimension, the reptilians. These are some ofthe ‘demons’ which these rituals have been designed to summon since this whole sadstory began thousands of years ago. This is when so much possession takes place andthe reptilians take over the initiate’s physical body. The leading Satanists are full-bloodreptilians cloaked in a human form. These rituals invariably take place on vortex pointsand so the terror, horror, and hatred, created by them enters the global energy grid andaffects the Earth’s magnetic field. Thought forms of that scale of malevolence holddown the vibrational frequency and affect human thought and emotion. Go to a placewhere Satanic rituals take place and feel the malevolence and fear in the atmosphere.What we call ‘atmosphere’ is the vibrational field and how it has been affected byhuman thought forms. Thus we talk about a happy, light or loving atmosphere, or a darkor foreboding one. The closer the Earth’s field is vibrationally to the lower fourthdimension, the more power the reptilians have over this world and its inhabitants.Satanism is not just a sickness and a perversion, although it is that also, its main reason"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"290for existence, from the Brotherhood’s point of view, is to control the Earth’s magneticfield; to worship and connect with their reptile masters; to drink the life-force of theirsacrificed victims; and to provide energy for the reptilians who appear to feed offhuman emotion, especially fear. These sacrifices are, literally, sacrifices to the ‘gods’,the reptilians, and they have been happening for thousands of years. The mass sacrificeof people by the Aztecs in Central America, and so many others, were to provide foodfor the physical reptilians and crossbreeds who eat the bodies and drink the blood, andenergy nourishment for the non-physical reptilians of the lower fourth dimension. PhilSchneider, a builder of US underground bases, told the writer and researcher, AlexChristopher, that when children reached the point where they could not work anymorein the slave conditions underground, they were consumed by the reptilians. They preferyoung children because they are not contaminated like adults. Hard to accept isn’t it?I’m sure your mind is screaming ‘nonsense’ at you because who wants to face a truthlike this? But unless we do, how is it ever going to be stopped?Satanic rituals generally take place at night because that is when the magnetic fieldis most stable. During the day the electrically charged particles of the solar wind causeturbulence in the field and make interdimensional connection more difficult. It is moststable during total eclipses and this is when native peoples held their most importantceremonies to contact and manifest other-dimensional entities. The tribal shamans knowthis. Satanic rituals and human sacrifice, especially of children, are performed on a vastscale and involve some of the most famous politicians, business people, media ownersand entertainers on the planet. Of course they do. It would be amazing if they did not,given the background. These rituals and human sacrifice have always been thefoundation of the Brotherhood ‘religion’ since ancient times. And the Brotherhoodmanipulates its Satanic initiates and ‘gofers’ into the positions of political, economic,business, military, medical and media power, and into influential positions in the worldof entertainment. Therefore the ratio of Satanists and child sacrificers at the top of theseprofessions and institutions is staggeringly high compared with the general population.Apparently, according to former Satanists I have met and read about, some worldpoliticians are addicted to blood taken from a victim at the moment of sacrifice becauseof the adrenaline which is produced at that time. I am told this addiction is quitecommon among Satanists, and researchers into the reptilian question suggest that this isthe substance the reptiles also want. It all fits.The theme of human and animal sacrifice can be easily charted from the ancientworld to the present day. Ironically, but understandably in the context of this book,much of it was designed to preserve life rather than destroy it. The belief was that onesacrifice to appease ‘the gods’ would protect the lives of many more. This is anotherorigin of the concept of the scapegoat, the one killed for the ‘sins’ of others. This has, ofcourse, manifested as many mythical religious ‘heroes’ who “died so our sins could beforgiven”. The sacrifice of the king or ruler to appease the gods is another ancienttradition. In the so-called cradle of civilisation, North Africa and the Near East, wherethe Anunnaki and the Watchers were documented, there were human sacrifices,"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"291particularly of children. Similar rituals were prevalent in China, Rome, Africa, Asia,Greece, South America and, most famously, in Mexico where the Aztecs sacrificed enmasse to the ‘gods’. This region is where the former President of Mexico, Miguel De LaMadrid, told the mind controlled slave of the CIA, Cathy O’Brien, that the reptileextraterrestrials came down and created physical bodies to occupy, just as they did mostprofusely among the Aryan people. The reptilians and human sacrifice go together. TheScandinavians buried children alive in an effort to stop plagues and to appease the greatgod of the North, the Scandinavian Odin or the German Wodan or Woden. The gods ofthe mystery schools were invariably connected to human sacrifice and it was these veryschools which have, via the now global Brotherhood and Satanism networks, carriedthe knowledge and the rituals into the present day. The Incas of Peru sacrificed childrenand human sacrifice was practised from the earliest days in Europe. One Druid ritualwas to bury a child under the foundations of a new building or to sprinkle the child’sblood on the site. The same ritual can be found in many parts of the world. In the storiesof St Columba (dove, Semiramis), this ‘Christian’ hero is said to have told his monksthat it was fitting for one of them to be buried in the foundations of a new monastery onthe Scottish island of lona (the Sun) to ‘hallow’ the ground. A Saint Oran volunteeredand as a result, it was believed, he went straight to heaven.1 Roman accounts by thehistorian, Tacitus, reveal how the Druids deemed it a duty to cover their altars with theblood of their captives and how they consulted the gods via human entrails. The samestories can be found in Ireland and Scotland. Irish myth says that Ireland was firstpeopled by a greedy group of gods called the Formorians who demanded two thirds ofthe children born each year. The Phoenicians and their kinsmen, the Carthaginians,sacrificed humans on a large scale and so did the Canaanites. When Carthage wasstruggling in the war against Rome, 200 noble families sacrificed their sons to Baal (thePhoenician Sun god, Bel or Bil).2Another theme is the sacrifice of the first born child, most often the first born son. Insome aboriginal tribes in Australia, the mother would kill and eat the first born child toensure she would be able to have more.3 The sacrifice of the first born of animals andhumans was quite common and is mentioned in the Old Testament. The Book of Kingstells how Mesha, the King of Moab, was so distraught by his defeat at the hands of theIsraelites that he sacrificed his eldest son and heir. Remember in Genesis how ‘God’(the gods) insisted that Abraham sacrificed his first born son to them to test his faith andobedience. The same ritual continues today among the Satanists, the bloodline familiesof the Brotherhood, and their organised crime offshoots like the Mafia. Sacrificing thefirst born son is used by these strange people as a way of testing a person’s commitmentto the cause.Yahweh-Jehovah makes it plain in the Book of Numbers that .... all the firstborn of Israel are mine, both man and beast,” and in Exodus, Yahweh demands that“The first of all thy sons shalt thou give unto me.” The Bible says that Abraham camefrom the Sumer city of Ur and excavations in 1927 by Sir Leonard Woolley in theRoyal Cemetery there revealed widespread evidence of human sacrifice in gravesdating from about 2,800 BC. The Scythians, the people who transported many of the"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"292Aryan bloodlines and rituals into Europe, did the same. Evidence of human sacrifice,especially children, can be found among all the main locations and peoples who arementioned in this book, including the palace of Knossos on Crete.4 The cult of the skullas a focus of ritual has recurred again and again in this story with the Templars, theRennes-le-Chateau mystery, and the Skull and Bones Society in the United States. Byexamining the bodies of Peking Man, dating from perhaps a million years ago, andNeanderthal man, dating from about 200,000 years ago, evidence of such rituals can befound even at these early times. The cult of the head, which included eating the brain ofthe victim, became more elaborate in Jericho some eight thousand years ago andevidence of the same rituals have been found in the Shinto religion in Japan and inancient China. Anath, the legendary sister of Baal, was portrayed festooned withsevered heads along with human hands hanging from her girdle, the same as the mothergoddesses of Mexico and India.5Written texts of ancient Egypt reveal many kinds of sacrifice and torture, which laterbecame widespread.6 The Egyptians would sacrifice red-headed men on the tomb ofOsiris because red was the colour associated with Set, the Egyptian version of Satan.Some rituals recalled by people today who have suffered indescribably in these horrors,mirror those detailed in the Egyptian Book Of The Dead and include keeping hearts in ajar.7 The hearts were placed on the scales in Egypt to be weighed for judgement by thegoddess, Maat. This is the real meaning of the woman with the sun crown holding theScales of Justice which you see on so many court buildings. In the ancient world, theBrahmin fakirs in India and other mystery schools knew of drugs, torture rituals and‘magic’ which created hallucinations. Silly fakirs. Hypnosis was widely used in thetemples. The demon worshippers of Bel/Baal/Nimrod in Canaan, Babylon andPhoenicia engaged in human sacrifice, cannibalism, and child murder in the name ofMoloch or Molech, an aspect of Nimrod/Baal, as part of their religious rituals.8 Baal(lord or ruler), the supreme god of the Canaanites and Phoenicians, was said to be thegiver of life and Moloch was the destroyer of life. Both demanded appeasement bysacrifice. Baal or Moloch became identified with the Roman god Saturn.In honour of Baal, the Sun god and god of fire, the Carthaginians, following the ritualsof the Phoenicians and Canaanites, rolled children into a fiery pit made in the shape of theimage of Baal/Moloch. At a site near modern Tunis six thousand urns were foundcontaining the charred remains of infants. Remember, these rituals and ‘gods’ are thesame as those performed and worshipped by the Satanists and the Brotherhood today.This is why the children of Waco were allowed to burn to death in an inferno causedentirely by the Satanist controlled FBI and the ATF, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco andFirearms, on April 19th 1993. These were the same deeply sick people who blew up theJames P. Murrah building in Oklahoma on April 19th 1995, in which so many childrendied. April 19th is a Satanic ritual day relating to fire - the fire god, Baal or Moloch. Andwhat does Moloch demand? The sacrifice of children. Waco and Oklahoma were childsacrifices to Baal/Moloch according to exactly the same belief system as those performedby the ancfiffits. In the same way, a war to these people is a mass blood ritual in which"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"293unimaginable numbers are killed and maimed, and the planet is engulfed by negativeemotional energy. It is this energy on which many of the lower fourth dimensionalreptilians either feed or use to manifest in this dimension. If you want undeniable proofthat the Branch Davidians and their children were sacrificed at Waco, I stronglyrecommend you watch the video: Waco: The Rules Of Engagement.9 You will neverbelieve an official statement again. The ritual names for the ‘demons’ are still the sametoday as those used in the ancient world and by later groups like the Templars.Confirmation of this comes from a stream of accounts by modern victims of Satanism. Afriend of mine, the British therapist, Vera Diamond, has been working for nearly 20 yearswith people who have been subjected to Satanic and mind control abuse. She says:“Children say the word Satan is used more frequently than any other, but other demonsinclude Baphomet and Behemoth. Molech (Moloch) seems to be one particularlyassociated with eating babies, and one called Choronzon. These do seem to beparticularly involved with sacrificing babies.”10Choronzon relates to Chronos, the Greek version of Nimrod. According to Greeklegend, Chronos swallowed his children as fast as they were born because he feared theywould overthrow him. Chronos was the most powerful of the Titans, the Greek name forthe giants who resulted from the interbreeding of the reptilians with the human,‘daughters of men’. Greek myth symbolically referred to them as children of the unionbetween heaven (extraterrestrials) and Earth (humans). Chronos was the father of Zeuswho survived because his mother hid him from her child-killing husband. Zeus laterwaged a victorious war against his father and other Titans and then ruled as the King ofGods over a dynasty awash with child sacrifice. As you connect the different peoplesacross the generations, so you find the same themes of human sacrifice. The Cannanite-Hebrews were seriously into the sacrifice of humans and animals, much as their spindoctors have tried to deny it over the years. The Satanists among the ‘Jewish’ hierarchytoday still perform the same rituals while the mass of the Jewish people worldwide haveno idea that this is so. Stories throughout the centuries to the present day of the sacrificeof children by Jewish fanatics at the time of the Passover can be seen to have an historicalbasis when you realise the true meaning of the Passover. It had nothing to do with ‘God’passing over the homes of Israelite children and killing only the first born Egyptians. Thisis more symbolism that only an initiate or a determined researcher would understand.Records from the 8th and 7th centuries BC, show that the Israelites burned their sons onsacrificial fires in the Valley of Gehinnon outside Jerusalem.11 The infants were said tohave been “passed over” or “passed through” the fire in sacrifice to Moloch-Baal. In theBook of Leviticus we find the line: “Thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through thefire to Moloch”. The prophet Jeremiah talks of the people: “burning their sons in the fireas burnt offerings unto Baal” and also in the Book of Jeremiah we are told that: “Theyhave built the high places of Tophet, which is in the Valley of Hinnon, to burn their sonsand daughters in the fire...” John Milton also wrote of Moloch in his Paradise Lost:"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"294“First Moloch, horrid king, besmirched with blood,Of human sacrifice, and parent’s tears,Though, for the noise of drums and timbrels loud,Their children’s cries unheard, that passed through fire,To his grim idol.”The Old Testament abounds with stories of animal and human sacrifice. The samesymbolism can be seen in a stream of ancient texts about the sacrifice of the first born oryoung children. The Jesus story includes this theme also, of course. At it’s most extreme,the Jewish dogma is deeply sacrificial. Their temples were slaughterhouses with aconstant supply of animals taken there for ritual murder and sacrifice. Look at the Jewishform of killing animals to this today. Meat is only considered ‘kosher’ if the animal hasits throat cut and dies by being bled dry. The same with the ‘halal’ meat of the Muslims.Through the Brotherhood bloodlines the ancient rituals have been strictly maintained andthe ruling Elite today are sacrificing children and drinking blood the same as they did inthe ancient world. The Hindu faith and the information for its sacred books, the Vedas,were taken to the Indian subcontinent by the Aryans from the Caucasus Mountains, oneof the centres for extraterrestrials/inner terrestrials and their offspring. It is thereforepredictable that the Vedas contain the same instructions for sacrifice to the gods. TheVedas, written about 1,400 BC, list the names of the gods and the victim most suitablefor each one. In the modern world, annual victims have been offered to the MotherGoddess Kali, the wife of the god, Shiva, and she was always believed to live off humanflesh. A male child was offered every Friday evening at the temple of Shiva at Tanjoruntil the practice was stopped (officially) in the mid-nineteeth century. The Thugs, one ofthe ancient secret societies in the Brotherhood network, murdered their victims accordingto elaborate rituals dedicated to Kali, who is depicted wearing a garland of skulls.Children or so-called ‘young virgins’ are used in these sacrificial rituals because theSatanists and their reptilian masters want to access the pure pre-pubescent energy fortheir own purposes. I have been told by Satanists, many of their victims, and bytherapists working with victims, the same stories of ‘regeneration rituals’. The ageingSatanist, sometimes a high ranking member of the Brotherhood, stands in the centre of acircle of babies or young children. As they are sacrificed the ritual allows the Satanist toabsorb their life-essense, their life-force, and regenerate his or her body. The world’smost famous Satanist, Aleister Crowley, who had connections to both WinstonChurchill and the Nazis, advocated human sacrifice and admitted to sacrificingchildren. In his 1929 book, Magick In Theory And Practice, he explains the reasons forritual death and why small boys are the best victims:“It was the theory of the ancient magicians that any living being is a storehouse of energyvarying in quantity according to the size and health of the animal, and in quality accordingto its mental and moral character. At the death of this animal this energy is liberatedsuddenly. For the highest spiritual working one must accordingly choose that victim which"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"295contains the greatest and purest force. A male child of perfect innocence and highintelligence is the most satisfactory and suitable victim.”12Crowley adds in a footnote that according to the records of the Satanist, FraterPerurabo, he performed just such a sacrifice 150 times every year between 1912 and1928. Think about that. It means that this one man ritually sacrificed almost 2,500young boys in that period alone. Do you still wonder what happens to many of themillions, yes millions, of children who go missing every year all over the world neverto be heard of again? And that’s without all of those bred for sacrifice that the publicknows nothing about. We can begin to see that the estimates of ritual sacrifices everyyear are no exaggeration. Satanism at its core is about the manipulation and theft ofanother person’s energy and consciousness. In olden times they called it “soulsnatching”. It may appear to be merely a sickening perversion, but those who trulyunderstand the background to the rituals know that what really matters is the effect ofthe rituals, not so much the rituals themselves. They are the means to an end - stealingor manipulating energy. Sex is so common in Satanic ritual because at the moment oforgasm, the body explodes with energy which the Satanists and the reptiles can captureand absorb. Sexual activity inspired by love resonates to a much higher vibration andtherefore cannot be accessed by the reptilians. Sex during a Satanic ritual or sacrifice,however, explodes the orgasmic energy at a very low frequency because of the intentinvolved and so the energy of Satanic sex resonates to the reptilian frequency. Theastrological energies constantly generated by the movement of the planets and thecycles of the Sun and Moon are also employed to add to the power of the rituals. Sothere are particular Satanic days for their most important ceremonies. On these daysunimaginable numbers of people, mostly children, are sacrificed. Some of the maindates are: Feb 1/2, Candlemas; March 21/22, spring equinox; April 30th/May 1st,Walpurgis Night/Beltane; June 21/22, summer solstice; July 31/August 1, Lammas -Great Sabbat festival; September 21/22, autumn equinox; October 31 st/November 1st,Samhain/Halloween; December 21/22, winter solstice or Yule.Let me emphasise again here that these dates and festivals are not Satanic inthemselves. They are times in the annual planetary cycle when very powerful energiesof various kinds are manifesting on the Earth and the rituals and ceremonies of both apositive and negative nature are performed on these dates. The cycle produces theenergy and the Satanists simply harness that energy for their own purposes, just as thepositive rituals do, like those performed by most modern Druids. Other dates forwidespread Satanic ritual include every full Moon because the reflected energy of theSun is at its most powerful on those occasions. Note also the significance to Satanists ofMay 1st, the day the Bavarian Illuminati was formed in 1776 and the day of celebrationin the Brotherhood-created Communist and Socialist calendar.The Key of Solomon is a book of occult magic which legend claims was written by‘King Solomon’ himself. It includes the pentagram in its instructions of how to invokedemons and make sacrifices to demons. Such ancient works provide the foundations for"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"296the same rituals in each generation. The inner core of the Knights Templar was involved inblack magic ritual and the Templars were accused of what today we call Satanism and ofrejecting Christianity by denying Christ and spitting on the cross. They were said toworship a demon power called Baphomet, a black magic symbol, also known as the Goatof Mendes. Capricorn (the goat, also symbolised by the unicorn) is the sign of the initiateand it represents political power, while Leo (the Sun, the lion) represents royal power.Hence the lion is the King of the Jungle and is the main symbol on the flag of the Britishroyal family. The planet Saturn rules Capricorn while the Sun rules Leo and Satanists andblack magicians are very much focused on the Sun and Saturn in their rituals. The Saturnvibration has a much bigger impact on the Earth than is recognised. In astrology it is theplanet of law and authority. Capricorn, the sign of authority, is also, according toastrologers, the astrological sign of England, that centre of global control. The name,Baphomet, is reckoned to derive from Greek words meaning baptism of wisdom orknowledge (initiation) and Dr Hugh Schonfield, one of the experts on the Dead SeaScrolls, says that using the code of the Essenes, the word Baphomet can be translated to‘Sophia’, the goddess of the Gnostics, and the Greek word for wisdom.13 Sophia is anothername for the female energy. Schonfield is sure there is a link between the Templars and theEssenes and so am I. He has demonstrated that the Templars used the same code, theAtbash Cipher, employed in some of the Dead Sea Scrolls.14 Other accusations against theTemplars were of killing children and teaching women how to abort.15 It is true that mostof these confessions were made under extreme torture by the Roman Church Satanists, theInquisition. But not all of these reports were gleaned in this way and the themes are sostrong, and the story so consistent, that it would be ridiculous just to dismiss them all. Andone thing is quite provable. These very ceremonies involving the ritual murder of children,and the use of women called breeders to produce babies and aborted foetuses for sacrificeto a demon ‘god’, are most certainly performed today and this Satanic structure of abuseand ritual murder is controlled by the very secret society network the Templars helped toexpand. The testimony of one Templar, Squin de Flexian, said they all had to swear neverto leave the Order and to further its interests by any means, right or wrong. No crimecommitted for the honour or benefit of the Order was considered to be sinful. He also madeallegations about sacrificing babies and aborting foetuses.16It is the same with the inner circles of the Freemasons. Credo Mutwa, the Zulushaman, told me that compared with the Freemason rituals he had seen in the UnitedStates and the United Kingdom, the voodoo and black magic of Africa was put in theshade. The secret password of Freemasonry is Tubal Cain, a descendant of thebiblical Cain, who was an Anunnaki crossbreed. Tubal Cain’s sister, Naamah,17 is saidto have been the one who brought human sacrifice and cannibalism into the world.18Tubal Cain is known as the father of witchcraft and sorcery and thus his name is aFreemasonic password.19 The ‘G’ on the symbol of Freemasonry stands forGnosticism (knowledge, knowing) and for generation, the fertility rites of the sexcults of ancient Baal and Ashtoreth.20 No doubt it is also a symbol connected togeneration and genetics, as in the reptilian bloodlines. You see the ‘G’ in the logo of"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"297the Gannett chain which has been buying up newspapers and television stations acrossthe United States and publishes the national daily, USA Today.21 The de Medicibloodline of the Black Nobility in Venice, who funded Christopher Columbus, includedCatherine de Medici, the Queen of France, who was reported to have commissionedhuman sacrifice in a Black Mass in the 16th century. A young boy was sacrificed andthe blood used in a communion designed to save her dying son, Philip.22 Medici worearound her neck a talisman with the name of the Satanic demon, Asmodei.23 BenjaminFranklin, a so-called pillar of the Christian Church and Founding Father of the UnitedStates, was a member of the Satanic Hellfire Club and the bodies of six children andfour adults have been found under his former home in London dated to the time helived there. Adolf Hitler and the Nazis were Satanists and so were their ‘opponents’ likeWinston Churchill and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The Rothschilds, formerly theinfamous German occult family, the Bauers, apparently use the Canaanite Satanicrituals24 while some of the bloodline families with long connections to the Celtic lands,like the St Clair-Sinclairs, prefer the Druid system.25 It was the Satanic deity, Ashtoreth,which inspired the name, Astor, one of the bloodline families which has been heavilyinvolved in Satanism.26 The Astors have close connections to the British royal familyand they were at the heart of the Profumo scandal in 1963 when the British DefenceMinister, John Profumo, was forced to resign after lying to the House of Commonsabout his involvement with Christine Keeler, a call girl who was also having a sexualrelationship with a Russian KGB agent. The Profumo-Keeler liaison was arranged byStephen Ward, a sado-masochist and black magician, who lived in a house on the Astorestate at Clivedon in Berkshire. There was much more to this than was allowed to comeout and if it ever does it will once again shine a light on some very dark practices andconnect with the highest echelons of British society, including the Windsors. PrincePhilip knew Stephen Ward and Lord Mountbatten was a guest at the infamous‘swimming party’ at Cliveden which played a major role in Profumo’s downfall.What is called Satanism is the ruling hierarchy of the Brotherhood pyramid under thecommand of the reptilians. Like all the other parts of the network, it is strictlycompartmentalised. The highest levels of the Satanic network lock into the highest levelsof the Brotherhood, but the lower degrees are not allowed to know the true nature of theorganisations they are involved in. Some of the levels of Satanism are known as the Sistersof Light, the Five Star Generals, Master Counsellors, Keeper of the Books, Keeper of theSeals, and there is one position called an Asmodeus.27 One of the global centres ofSatanism is the Castle of Darkness, the Chateau des Amerois or Castle of Kings, inBelgium, near the appropriately named village of Muno Bel. The castle is close to theFrench border and some 20 kilometres from Luxemburg. It is protected from view by thickforests and guards keep out the curious. In the grounds is a cathedral with a domecontaining 1,000 lights.28 When President George Bush talked of 1,000 points of light, hewas speaking in code about this place of initiation for the highest initiates of the Satanicpyramid. In this Satanic cathedral is the throne of the high priestess of the upper hierarchy,a position known as the Queen Mother.29 Every day, apparently, a child is sacrificed in the"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"298basement.30 Ceremonies are performed here to the Satanic ‘goddess’ known as Lilith, ademon in the Hebrew Cabala. In ancient Sumer the reptilian bloodline, as passed onthrough the female, was symbolised as a lily and the main reptilian gene carriers weregiven names like Lilith, Lili, Lilutu and Lillette. Elizabeth (El-lizard-birth) is aderivative of this. Another demon used by some ‘Mothers’ is called Bilair, Bilar, andBilid, cabalistic names for the force others call Satan, etc.31 It is from these lands inBelgium and northern France that the bloodline families came, including the Bruces, totake over Scotland all those centuries ago. Belgium, this little country between Franceand the Netherlands, is also the home of the European Union, NATO, and, I am told, amassive computer centre where databases on all the people of the world are beingcompiled. It is known apparently as ‘the Beast’ and there are a number of these aroundthe world. An Elite mind control operation called the Janus Group is also based in theNATO headquarters. Nimrod was Eannus, the god with two faces, who was later knownto the Romans as Janus. The reason that Belgium is a headquarters for Satanism and somany Brotherhood institutions is very simple. The Brotherhood created Belgium forjust this reason in 1831 and they imposed upon it a reptilian ‘royal’ line, the House ofSaxe-Coburg-Gotha, the bloodline of the British royal family and, through its branch inPrussia, the supporters of Adam Weishaupt, the founder of the Bavarian Illuminati.The paedophile murder ring which came to light in Belgium in 1996 is but one part ofthe Satanic network operating from and in that country. It was organised by MarcDutroux, who is connected to the Satanic Order of Abrasax, based in the village ofForchies-la-Marche near Charleroi in southern Belgium, not far from the Castle ofDarkness. Abrasax is Abraxas, a fat-bellied demon from whom, it is likely, the magiciansterm, abracadabra, originated. Dutroux buried alive an accomplice, Bernard Weinstein,and among Weinstein’s effects was a letter from the Abrasax group signed by someonedescribing himself as the Egyptian god, Anubis. It ordered him to provide ‘presents’ forthe High Priestess of the Order and apparently gave specific details of the age and sexthe victims must be. The British Sunday Times reported the accounts of witnessesdescribing Black Masses in which children were killed in front of audiences whichincluded prominent members of Belgian society.32 A Belgian newspaper reported that aformer commissioner of the European Union was among a group of judges, seniorpoliticians, lawyers, and policemen, who attended orgies at a Belgian chateau organisedby Michel Nihoul, one of the accomplices of Marc Dutroux, the alleged leader of thepaedophile ring. One investigator said it was “Like going back to the Middle Ages”33 Infact there has not been an old, middle, and modern age with regard to these rituals. It is aseamless flow over thousands of years under the control of the same bloodlines. Humanskulls were found at the sacrificial sites identified by witnesses, particularly at the sect’sheadquarters. The Satanic group behind the Belgian murders is said to interconnect withsimilar rings in Holland, Germany, and America.34 In truth, it will be part of the globalnetwork which operates in all countries. Satanism is run like a transnational corporation.Black magic rituals are going on all over the world and I have spoken with victimsin country after country. In England I met a brave woman, then aged 40. The story she"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"299told me of her experiences mirrored those of so many others. She was born in Darlingtonin the 1950s, and soon after she was sold by her Satanic father to two other Satanists.She knew them only as Thomas and Helena. She was brought up in the most horrificcircumstances at a children’s home in Hull which was run by two child abusers. At nighta torchlight was shone into their bedrooms and when it was held on a child for a minuteor so, they knew it was their turn to go downstairs and be sexually abused. Duringholidays back in Darlington, from the age of just seven and eight, she met her father wholinked her with the two Satanists, Thomas and Helena. She would be given drugs viaorange juice and ice cream and be taken at night in a van to country churches in theDarlington area. The drugs were designed to make her easier to mind control and toprevent her from remembering what she saw. I will explain more about this in the nextchapter. However, as is often the case when people enter their 30s and 40s, the victimscan begin to have flashbacks of their ordeals. They experience them again like watchinga movie screen. It is for this reason that so many are murdered before they reach that age,often for ‘snuff’ videos, which show in graphic detail a person being murdered. Othersare subjected to the snatch back when they are abducted to undergo ‘booster’ mind-programming to keep the memories secret. Increasing numbers of people who survivedtheir horrendous young lives, are now beginning to remember and they are telling thesame basic tale. If you are one of them, please contact me if you have anything to add towhat I outline here. An address is at the back of the book. Within days of speaking to me,my informant says she was grabbed off the street and bungled into a van by six Satanists.A syringe was held to her throat and she was warned to stop talking to “That dangerousprat, Icke” and to stop naming names. They threatened her life and those of her childrenif she continued. She was also told that if she didn’t keep quiet, the family dog would betaken and “Posted back to you in pieces”. Nice people.In the ordeals at the country churches which she now remembers, my Englishinformant and other children would be used in Satanic rituals involving sex, torture, andmurder. The windows of the church were covered over with black drapes and the insidewas laid out according to Satanic law with different colours used for different ceremoniesdepending on the time of year. Sometimes they would use the churches in secret, butdon’t underestimate how many people in the Christian clergy are also members of theSatanic network. The Satanists, she remembers, were dressed in robes and a number woremasks, including the face of a goat or Baphomet, the deity the Templars were accused ofworshipping. In the UK, as in America, some of the best known names in the country areinvolved. She remembers vividly (God, the thought of it), being laid on her back on thefloor of a church as a screaming boy, no more than six, was being held by the hair aboveher while a man, who she would later identify as a top politician in Northern Ireland, hadanal sex with him. When it was over, a knife was produced to cut the boy’s throat and theblood poured over her. “I remember this man’s eyes,” she told me. “The coldness of hiseyes I will never forget.” He prefers boys to girls, she said.On more than one occasion, she says, she was brutally raped by a man who has beena major name in United Kingdom politics for decades. This man, she says, used to hold"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"300her naked body to him by using hooks inserted into her flesh at the hip. She was just alittle girl when this was happening. She told me that this man was Edward Heath andhis name comes up again and again in interviews with victims of Satanic abuse inBritain. Heath was the UK Prime Minister from 1970-74 and the Bilderberg Groupmember who signed the UK into the European Community, now Union. He has beenone of the main architects of Britain’s further integration into the United Fascist Statesof Europe. One of the many unconnected people who have identified Heath as aSatanist was the lady I mentioned early in the book who saw the ‘lizard’ figure atBurnham Beeches in Buckinghamshire, 25 minutes drive from the British PrimeMinister’s official country residence called Chequers. The game of chequers is playedon a board of black and white squares - the floor plan of all Freemasonic temples.Burnham Beeches is not far from High Wycombe and the headquarters of the HellfireClub of Benjamin Franklin and Sir Francis Dashwood. I’m sure Burnham Beecheswould have been one of their haunts, too. This lady was the wife of the Head Keeper atBurnham Beeches and they lived on the land. She had been brought up by a Satanicfamily in Scotland and had been sexually and ritually abused as a child by the ScottishBrotherhood network. Her husband was also a Satanist which is why he was given theresponsibility of looking after Burnham Beeches, an area of ancient groves and forestsmanaged by the authorities in London and including an area called Egypt Wood. Lateone night in the early 1970s during Heath’s reign as Prime Minister, she was taking herdog for a walk when she saw some lights. Quietly she moved closer to see what wasgoing on. To her horror she saw that it was a Satanic ritual and in the circle was the thenPrime Minister, Edward Heath, and his Chancellor of the Exchequer, Anthony Barber.She says that as she watched him, Heath began to transform into a reptile and she saidthat what surprised her was that no-one in the circle seemed in the least surprised. “Heeventually became a full-bodied Reptiloid, growing in size by some two foot.” She saidhe was “slightly scaly” and “spoke fairly naturally, although it sounded like ‘longdistance’ - if you can imagine the short ‘time’ lapses”. I remember well meeting Heathon a television election programme in 1989 while I was a spokesman for the BritishGreen Party and I have never seen such cold and unpleasant eyes in my life. I knewnothing of these subjects then, but the look of his eyes I have never forgotten.Another famous paedophile and Satanist in Britain is Lord McAlpine, the formertreasurer of Heath’s Conservative Party, and executive of the McAlpine Constructionempire. He also followed the late Jimmy Goldsmith as head of the Referendum Party inBritain which was created to hijack the groups opposing the European Union and leadthem to glorious failure. McAlpine, who is heavily involved in a network of Brotherhoodsecret societies, including the Freemasons, has been publicly named as a paedophile bythe investigative magazine, Scallywag.35 He was accused of having oral sex with anunderage boy in 1965 and was formerly cautioned by Strathclyde Police for sexualoffences against a minor. McAlpine was also named by one of the former residents at theBryn Alyn Children’s Home in North Wales who said he was forced to have oral sex withhim. The McAlpine family is one of the Elite bloodlines of Scotland, possibly connecting"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"301with the ancient Scottish king, Kenneth McAlpin. The McAlpine family has a longhistory of Satanism in its ranks, as does the Scottish Keswick family. Both are part of aweb which operates across the world into the Far East and Australia. A close friend ofthe McAlpines is Willie Whitelaw, a chairman of the Conservative Party. He was alsoDeputy Prime Minister to Margaret Thatcher, who was ‘minded’ by Whitelaw, theMcAlpines, and Sir Geoffrey Howe, during her years as Prime Minister. When she hadoutlived her usefulness to the Brotherhood, it was Howe who made the speech in theHouse of Commons which effectively ended her reign. Whitelaw was named as aleading Satanist by self-confessed Satanist, Derry Mainwaring-Knight, at MaidstoneCrown Court in 1986. As usual, nothing was done about it.36 Mainwaring-Knight livednear East Grinstead, one of the centres of Satanism in England. In Scotland, a foremostSatanic centre is Loch Ness, near Inverness, the home, according to the legend, of thefamous reptile, the Loch Ness monster. So what could these legends really be symbolicof? Aleister Crowley, the best known Satanist of the 20th century, had a house at LochNess and it was to this area that he came to perform some of his most powerful blackmagic rituals. A rock formation near the loch called the Rock of Curses has been usedby black magicians for hundreds of years and Crowley was particularly drawn to theenergy emanating from a nearby mountain known as Mealfuorvonie.37 There is muchmore to the legend of the Loch Ness Monster than meets the eye and the same is true ofother unidentified creatures like the so-called Bigfoot. Some Native American shamansbelieve that the entity which manifests as the Bigfoot can also appear as an aquaticmonster or a panther because it has the ability to shape-shift.38Over and over I have been told by survivors of how they were abused or programmedat the stately homes of the aristocracy or in rooms under the British Museum and otherofficial buildings in London. Names of Conservative government ministers keeprecurring in survivor’s accounts. Another paedophile is the former Leicester member ofParliament, Greville Janner, a vociferous campaigner for Jewish causes in Britain. Anotorious location for paedophile activities is an apartment block called Dolphin Squarein Pimlico, the biggest block of flats in Europe and the London residence of manymembers of Parliament. The building has been under surveillance by the British Customsafter the discovery of pornographic material from Amsterdam. One resident was quotedas saying: “We often have underage boys wandering in the corridors totally lost, askingfor the flat of a particular MP.” Pimlico has been nicknamed ‘Pimp-lico’ because of thewidespread use of boy prostitutes known as rent boys. The Dolphin Square resident,David Steel, the Scottish former leader of the Liberal Democrats, has actively supportedcampaigns for ‘gay rights’ by Ian Campbell Dunn, a planning officer at EdinburghDistrict Council. But Mr Campbell wants rather more than just ‘gay rights’. He is afounding member of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE), which wants tolegalise sex with children.39 Should Mr Steel be supporting such a character? The formercabinet ministers, Michael Portillo and Peter Lilley, are apparently regular diners at therestaurant in Dolphin Square along with many famous political figures. I wonder whatthe attraction can be? Must be the food. Yes, definitely the food."},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"302People think that ritual abuse and sacrifice, if it exists at all, is rare. Like hell it is.Human sacrifice and ritual abuse is rampant. Look at the Satanic child abuse andmurder network exposed in Belgium which involves the police, judges, and toppoliticians. The same is coming to light in North Wales and other areas of the UK. Thelack of interest by the media is stunning, if not surprising. Ted Gunderson, a man of 28years experience with the FBI, told a mind control conference in the United States thatafter long and detailed research, he estimates there are 3.75 million practising Satanistsin the US and between 50 and 60,000 human sacrifices a year. Therapists at theconference said that their clients had pointed to a massive Satanic grave site in openland outside Lancaster, California.40 Another exists, apparently, at Matamoros, Mexico.The Satanic ritual network connects into the children’s homes, care centres, andrunaway hostels to ensure a constant supply of children. Please tell me what you know.A short while before this book was sent to the printer, I was contacted by a friend inthe United States who was deprogramming a mind controlled slave of the Brotherhoodcalled Arizona Wilder. I will explain how this mind control is done in the next chapter.She had been mind controlled from childhood to be a so-called Mother Goddess, whoconducts sacrificial rituals at the highest levels of the global Brotherhood. Arizona wasone of only three women at that level in the world. She has performed rituals for theBritish royal family, as you will see in the chapter, The Goddess and the King, and thislady is so high in the Satanic hierarchy that even the Queen is, apparently, forbidden tospeak to her during the ceremonies. She was genetically bred for this job and hermother is of French noble descent. Arizona told me that the reptilians do not appear tobe that psychic, and I guess this has something to do with the lack of a fully formedemotional and spiritual level of being, and so they mind control and programmehumans of particular bloodlines, like her, to perform the rituals and draw in theenergies for them. She says she was personally programmed by Josef Mengele (sheknows him as Green or Greenbaum), a shape-shifting reptilian, and the infamous Nazimind controller and genetic manipulator, who escaped at the end of the war with thehelp of British and American Intelligence to continue his horrors in the UnitedKingdom, the United States, and South America. He once showed her a spider a footwide which he had genetically developed and he introduced her to Adolf Hitler in theUnited States in the 1960s. She has described many top secret facilities in the UnitedStates which my friend has personally seen himself and every time she has been 100%accurate. She says that each of the ruling 13 families of the global Brotherhood havetheir own council of 13. The most powerful council in the United States is based inCalifornia and among the members are Robert Caldwell, his son Richard, JimChristensen, Richard Hoehn, Richard Bradbury, Jim Efferson, Fred Danger and FrankCohen. But the head of that council, and the highest-ranked member of the Illuminati(Brotherhood) that she knows, is a man code-named Pindar from the Alsace-Lorraineregion of France. Pindar means ‘Penis of the Dragon’. His name, Arizona says, is theMarquis de Libeaux. I have not yet established if this is his real name or anotherpseudonym - can you help? Libeaux relates to ‘of the water’ and is consistent with the"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"303ancient legends of reptilian gods coming from the water. She says that in the basementof his chateau in Alsace-Lorraine there is an opening into the subterranean world. Notethe area - Lorraine, home to key reptilian bloodlines going back many centuries as Ioutlined earlier. This mind controlled high priestess/ Mother Goddess was impregnatedby Pindar, she says, but her own mind began to reject the programming and she abortedthe foetus and broke with the Brotherhood. As often happens, her programming beganto break down when her programmer, Mengele, died in the late 1980s. Arizona says thatPindar, like all the reptilians when they shape-shift, has very powerful hypnotic eyes(the ‘evil eye’ of legend) and at sacrifices the victim’s face is turned to Pindar at themoment of death for him to steal the person’s soul or energy through this ‘evil eye’magnetic process.The following is information that has been supplied by Arizona: Pindar attends themajor Satanic ceremonies in Europe and then flies to California for the rituals there.Beltane used to be celebrated in Trebuco Canyon in Orange County, California, but dueto urban sprawl, the rites are now conducted in nearby Blackstar Canyon, which isclosed to the public. Local streets are also cordoned off by members of the OrangeCounty Sheriff’s Department. The Samhain ritual is conducted at the Eastside ChristianChurch located at the junction of 7th Avenue and Temple in Longbeach. Outside thechurch is a logo of a white dove with a red goblet between its wings. This is Semiramisagain and white is considered a demonic colour by these people, hence Pindar, the‘Marquis de Libeaux’, travels in a white limousine. (A ‘code-white’ is a codeunderstood by judges, police, the military, etc, and it means: look the other way or donot prosecute this person). Military guards carrying automatic weapons protect thechurch and inquisitive outsiders are ritually murdered and disposed of at the mortuarydown the street. The Walpurgis ritual takes place at the west side of Catalina Island. TheCoastguard vessel, Golden Eagle, takes sacrificial children who can’t swim across tothe site and they are thrown overboard. The bodies are recovered and placed in cagesfilled with starving sharks for disposal.At outdoor rituals, Arizona says she wore a red robe and stood in the centre of apentagram which was surrounded by a hexagram or Star of David. She was triggeredinto her ‘Isis’ program and conducted the Drawing Down of the Moon ceremony which,she says, made four snarling, hideous creatures materialise in the Satanists’ circle. Thesacrificial victims, who have been bred from birth for the role, are ritually killed byslashing the throat from left to right. This is the origin of the Freemasonic sign ofpulling the flat hand across the throat from left to right, a movement which means“You’re dead”. The blood from the victims is collected and mixed with arsenic, whichappears to be a necessary element for those of the human-reptilian bloodlines. This ispoured into goblets and consumed by the Satanists, together with the liver and eyes.This is supposed to provide strength and greater psychic vision. Fat is scraped from theintestines and smeared over the bodies of the participants - like the fat of the ‘messeh’in ancient Egypt. The corpse is then suspended from a tree and the Satanists standnaked to allow the dripping blood to fall on them. The Mother Goddess says that by this"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"304time the participants are in such a high state of excitement that they often shape-shiftinto reptilians and mostly manifest, she says, in a sort of off-white colour. They are alsoterrified, because at this point the Mother Goddess points to four of them and they arethen ritually murdered. Clare Reeves, the President of Mothers Against Sexual Abuse inthe US, told me that at least 12 ritually abused clients had reported that the participantsshape-shifted into reptilians. Another ritual takes place in Orange County at Dana CovePoint in which a pregnant woman is drowned and her baby removed. The British royalfamily, Ronald and Nancy Reagan, Gerald Ford, George Bush, the two Bush Governorsons, Henry Kissinger, Newt Gingrich, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Rothschilds,Habsburgs, Bob Hope, Rupert Murdoch and a stream of other famous names have allattended sacrificial rituals at which this Mother Goddess has presided, Arizona says.She says that Hillary is the power that controls Bill Clinton because she is far higher upthe hierarchy than him. He is mind controlled, she says, and Hillary is his handler. Shealso reports that she has seen reptilians, Greys, and reptile-human hybrids at manyunderground facilities, including the infamous Area 51 in Nevada. She says thatastronaut Neil Armstrong took pictures on the Moon of translucent structures and anunderground habitat. These pictures are, apparently, in a building in Oklahoma City.The Mother Goddess said that she had also conducted Satanic ceremonies in Franceinvolving Pope John Paul II. Another source within the mind control community reportsthat the Pope is also a mind contolled stooge and a contact with relatives in the Vaticantold me that they were slowly poisoning the Pope to ensure that he dies in time for theirchosen one to replace him at the right time. We should expect, he said, to see the Popelooking more and more frail and sick in the weeks and months ahead.What the victims have told me would be almost unbelievable were it not comingfrom so many different, unconnected sources and were not the stories across the worldnot telling the same basic tale, even down to the details of the rituals and the mindprogramming techniques. The children, and the traumatised adults they become, havenowhere to turn. Their stories are so astonishing that few believe them and they arefrightened of going to the police because they know that the Satanic network includestop police officers, judges, civil servants, media people, politicians, and many otherswho control our ‘free’ society. Questions like “Who are you going to tell?” and “Whereare you going to run?” are used to break their spirit. Their sense of hopelessness makesthem think there is nothing they can do to seek justice, so they give up and stop trying.The vast majority of Freemasons are not Satanists or child abusers, but there is a fargreater ratio of them in secret societies like the Masons, than outside. How can youhave confidence in justice therefore when, for instance, the Manor of St James’sFreemasonry Lodge, No 9179, consists of the leading operational police officers fromall the major units of London’s Metropolitan Police, including the Anti-Terrorist Squad,Fraud Squad, and the Complaints Investigations Branch which is supposed toinvestigate allegations of police wrong-doing! The St James’s Lodge further includessenior figures from the Home Office, judiciary, and the Directorate of PublicProsecutions, which decides if a person will or will not be prosecuted. The whole"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"305system of investigation, prosecution, and trial, or the suppression of them, can be achievedby members of this one lodge working together. What chance has a child got against that?Also, as many of the victims have said, they themselves are drugged andprogrammed to take part in the ritual murder and torture of other children. This isvideoed and played back to them when they are in a conscious state. They are sohorrified at what they have done and so terrified of the consequences that they dare notspeak to the authorities. Other techniques to prevent exposure include abusing childrenwhile wearing a Mickey Mouse face or a Devil’s head. When little children say theywere abused by Mickey Mouse or the Devil it makes them even less likely to bebelieved. One woman who contacted me said that her father sexually abused her whilewearing a Devil’s head and it was a long time before she realised that her father wasresponsible. The stories of the people I have talked to, and the accounts of others I haveread, tell of events that are beyond comprehension or, at least, they would be if theywere not actually happening. Drinking blood, eating the flesh of dead bodies, thousandsof adults and children buried in deep graves, the murder of people on camera for the so-called ‘snuff’ videos, the story is just appalling. One mother told a televisiondocumentary in the Dispatches series on Channel Four in the UK, of how she wasforced to place her new-born baby on a Satanic altar and push a knife through its heart.A Satanist then had sex with the dead body. This is happening in your country NOW!Many of the victims are born into Satanic families and others are bred for sacrificethrough the use of breeders: women kept in captivity to give birth to one child after anotherwhich are never formerly registered and so, according to official records, they don’t exist.You can’t murder someone who doesn’t exist and so these children and foetuses aresacrificed without anyone outside the circle knowing the children have even been born.The Ku Klux Klan, the Aryan master race fanatics created by the Freemason Satanist,Albert Pike, are one of the endless groups who keep women under lock and key for thispurpose.41 These groups have their own midwives who supervise the births and they arealso born in hospitals under the supervision of staff loyal to the Brotherhood and theirSatanic ritual offshoots.42 Other children from non-Satanic families are taken away at birthand the parents are told their child has died when in fact they are taken away to besacrificed or to be used in the mind control projects I will discuss in the next chapter. Lowincome parents, and those addicted to drugs, are at the mercy of the Freemasons andSatanists operating among the social services hierarchy and judges. Their children areoften taken away from them for Satanic ritual or mind control projects. So called ‘crack’babies are apparently sought after for mind control operations, as are twins. I know oftwins who were crack babies in Denver, Colorado, a major Satanic centre. They were firsttaken from their parents and given to foster parents. Later they were taken from the fosterparents by Denver Social Services after the husband was murdered in very strangecircumstances and they were given to a single woman who had turned up out of nowhereafter the murder and offered to be a nanny to the children. The Satanic ring centred inDenver connects into Boulder, Colorado and this was where the child beauty queen,JonBenet Ramsey, was found murdered in her parents home in very mysterious and"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"306unexplained circumstances in December 1996. The American coroner and investigator,Dr Cyril Wecht, says that the evidence proves that her death happened during sexualabuse by her parents, John and Patsy Ramsey.43 JonBenet was murdered on ChristmasEve and Josef Mengele created a sacrificial ritual for this date called “The Last Bulb onthe Christmas Tree”. Mengele’s pseudonym, Greenbaum, means green tree and relatesto the Cabalistic Tree of Life. A Brotherhood term for the Devil is JonBet and thecoincidence is so amazing that, given the other circumstances, I cannot believe that thiswas not the true inspiration for her name.A research project into ritual abuse at the University of Colorado at Boulder found thatall of those questioned had been subjected to intercourse or molestation; 97% saw or tookpart in animal sacrifice; 97% forced to take part in sex with adults; 97% experiencedtorture; 94% were sodomised; 88% were forced to watch or take part in human sacrifice;88% in cannibalism. A long, long list of child and other murders across the world are thework of Satanic groups, including, I would strongly contend, the still unexplained murderof 13-year-old Genette Tate near Exeter in Devon in 1978. Her body has never beenfound. I have met with people who have been investigating this case for many years andthe evidence is overwhelming that it involved a Satanic group which could well haveincluded some leading personnel at the Devon and Cornwall police headquarters, a shortdistance from where Genette was last seen alive. Her father, John Tate, also has somesignificant questions to answer. A manuscript exists of this evidence if there is a publisherout there who is interested in exposing the case. When sceptics ask how such widespreadSatanism, abuse and murder can be covered up, they need to appreciate the sort of peoplewho are involved in these rings. David Berkowitz, the serial killer in New York known asthe Son of Sam, has written that he was part of a Satanic group which had orchestrated themurders. In letters to a church minister, Berkowitz said:“...this group contained a mixture of Satanic practices, including the teachings of AleisterCrowley and Eliphas Levi (another notorious Satanist). It was (and still is) totally bloodorientated... The coven’s doctrines are a blend of ancient Druidism, teachings of the secretorder of the Golden Dawn, black magick, and a host of other unlawful and obnoxiouspractices...Satanists (genuine ones) are peculiar people. They aren’t ignorant peasants or semi-literate natives. Rather, their ranks are filled with doctors, lawyers, businessmen, andbasically highly responsible citizens... They are not a careless group who are apt to makemistakes. But they are secretive and bonded together by a common need and desire tomete out havoc on society. It was Aleister Crowley who said: “I want blasphemy, murder,rape, revolution, anything bad.”44Satanism is the creation of the reptilians, the ‘fallen angels’, and interestingly theyalso had a son of Sam according to a one thousand-year-old account. The Arab poet,Firdowsi, completed his legendary history of Iran in 1010 AD, a work called theShahnameh or Book of Kings. He writes about a king called Sam who married a"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"307beautiful woman who gave birth to a baby of unearthly appearance. The description ofthe baby’s features is exactly the same as the children born of the interbreeding betweenthe Watchers and human women - very large, white skinned, and hair like snow. Hisname was Zal, a Nefilim child, a Watcher (reptilian) - human hybrid. And Zal was theson of Sam. In 1969, Charles Manson and his Satanic ‘Family’ murdered nine people,including the actress Sharon Tate. Manson operated in California in the Flower Poweryears when a group called the Process had a high profile in cities like San Francisco.The Process emerged in Britain and then established branches in California and NewYork. The group celebrates Adolf Hitler and worships a Trinity of Jehovah, Lucifer, andSatan. In the British occult magazine, The Lamp Of Thoth, a writer by the name ofSoror H, said of Charles Manson: “(He) showed many of us what it is like to actuallycommit the crime we’d like to commit... Manson went astray where others like theProcess succeeded. He got caught.”45 Another serial killer, Henry Lee Lucas, who issaid to have murdered 360 people, including his mother, claimed he was a member ofthe Hand of Death Satanic group. He said that murder was part of the initiation and headmitted to drinking the blood of some of his victims. The Hand of Death, he said, wasinvolved in drug running and the kidnapping of children for slavery and sacrifice. Whenthey were killed, the group would drink their blood and eat part of their body, Lucassaid. Mutilated bodies were found in Mexico and Arizona which appeared to supporthis story. Richard Ramirez, the serial killer known as the Knight Stalker, said he killedhis thirteen victims in the name of Satan. Inverted pentagrams, the classic Satanicsymbol, were found spray painted in the homes of several of his victims and he carved apentagram on the thigh of an elderly woman.The number of murders world-wide involving Satanic ritual is simply fantastic. WhileI was writing this book I heard from another researcher of the ritual murder of AlfredKunz, a rebel Roman Catholic priest who performed exorcisms. He was found inMarch1998 in his rectory at Madison, Wisconsin, hanging upside down with his throatcut from ear to ear. His head had then been cut off and his blood taken away. Such werethe circumstances in the case that the FBI was called in to investigate. The assassinationsof President Kennedy and Princess Diana were full of Satanic ritual, also, as I shalloutline later. I hear the same themes of Satanic ritual, abuse and sacrifice in everycountry I visit and even on the Isle of Wight, the small island off the south coast ofEngland where I have lived for many years, there is substantial Satanic activity. Britain’sbiggest selling Sunday tabloid, The News Of The World, published the revelations of acommunity worker on the Isle of Wight who exposed the nature and extent of the abusethere. She said that these Satanic sacrificers of children were pillars of the localcommunity, owners of seaside hotels, business people, local government officers, andpoliticians. She described the breeding programmes on the island in which babies arebred for sacrifice and how it connected into the paedophile and drug smuggling rings,another common theme. Detective Chief Inspector Neil Kingman, who was heading theinquiry, said: “I have met the community worker several times and interviewed otherpeople regarding this matter. I have no reason to doubt what I am being told.”46"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"308There have been many famous cases in which ritual abuse has been alleged, but thesehave been successfully covered up by the political and judicial authorities and acompliant, uninformed, and slanted media. In the United States, the McMartin case inLos Angeles which came to light in 1983 was a prime example. It involved allegationsby 369 children at the McMartin Day Care Centre that they had been sexually abused.They told of animals being slaughtered and other Satanic rituals. They described howthey were buried, locked in the dark, and taken to different locations to be abused. Theseincluded a grocery store, a cemetery, a church, and a crematorium. The children said theywere forced to drink blood and urine and they saw the eyes of a baby ripped out and itsbody incinerated. Others said that a rabbit was killed in front of them to show whatwould happen if they told their parents. The case was under investigation for four years,on trial for two and a half years, involved 124 witnesses, 50,000 pages of transcript, andcost almost $23,000 a day But in the end it fell apart and those responsible escaped withtheir freedom. Crucial to the children’s stories was their description of a network ofsecret tunnels under the building through which they said they were taken to be abused.It was claimed at the trial that there was no evidence that these tunnels existed, but fivemonths after the files were closed on the McMartin case and the official cover upcompleted, a team of trained investigators and excavators uncovered the tunnel systemwhich connected to a vaulted room under the day care centre. They extended out toadjacent buildings where the children said they had been taken before they were drivento other locations. In 1991, an independent archaeologist also confirmed the existence ofthe tunnels and an alarm system inside the centre. In other words, the children had beentelling the truth. In Britain there have been, among many others, cases in Orkney,Nottingham, Rochdale and Cleveland. Each time the social workers trying to exposeSatanic abuse have been subjected to a blitz of condemnation by the mainstream mediawith the Mail On Sunday particularly vehement in its opposition. It went so far on oneoccasion as to describe the “spectre” of Satanism as “hysterical nonsense”. Such remarksare so at odds with worldwide evidence that they can only be the work of an uninformedidiot (quite possible) or someone who wishes the truth to remain uncovered. As a resultof such imbalanced coverage and, of course, the staggering nature of the children’sevidence, most cases do not even come to trial and when they do very few lead toconviction. The public would rather believe the allegations are not true because theywant to believe such horrors are not happening. Unfortunately they are, on a vast scale,and if you go into denial about it because you don’t want to face the truth about yourworld, then you are helping to perpetuate this unspeakable treatment of children. AsCaroline Lekiar of the National Association of Young People in Care, said:“I can understand people finding it difficult to believe, it’s extraordinary, but yet, everythingis showing that it is happening. Young kids are drawing pictures of the type of thing thatdon’t come on TV. I’ve been dealing with this for the last two years, I’ve come across manycases of ritualistic abuse and a lot of it happens all over the place; people have really gotto wake up.”47"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"309Satanic ritual abuse is a global network, another pyramid of interconnecting groups,with the high and mighty of society among their numbers, top politicians, governmentofficials, bankers, business leaders, lawyers, judges, doctors, coroners, publishers,editors and journalists. All the people you need, in fact, to carry out and cover up yourrituals and crimes against humanity. It is not that researchers see Satanists everywhere.The ratio of them in leading positions is very high because that’s the way it is meant tobe. The Satanic networks control the system and so they ensure that there is a far, far,higher ratio of Satanists in positions of power than there are in the general population.The higher you go up the pyramids, the more Satanists you find. Most of the non-Satanists are filtered out before they reach those levels. The result of all this for thechildren involved is beyond the imagination of anyone who has not experienced thelevel of trauma that they must suffer. The singer, Joan Baez, sings a song aboutrecalling childhood abuse as the amnesiac barriers begin to fall, the mind control breaksdown, and the memories come flashing back. The words capture the feelings of suchpeople magnificently:You don’t have to play me backwards,To get the meaning of my verse,You don’t have to die and go to hell,To feel the Devil’s curse.Well I thought my life was a photograph,On the family Christmas card.Kids all dressed in buttons and bows,And lined up in the yard.Were the golden days of childhood,So lyrical and warm?Or did the picture start to fade,On the day that I was born.Let the night begin, there’s a pop of skin,And the sudden rush of scarlet,There’s a little boy riding on a goat’s head,And a little girl playing the harlot.There’s a sacrifice in an empty church,Of sweet li’l baby Rose,And a man in a mask from Mexico,Is peeling off my clothes.I’ve seen them light the candles,I’ve heard them beat the drum,And I’ve cried Mama, Mama, I’m cold as ice,And I’ve got no place to run."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"310So I’m paying for protection,Smoking out the truth,Chasing recollections,Nailing down the proof.I’ll stand before your altar,And tell everything I know,I’ve come to claim my childhood,At the chapel of baby Rose.48What an horrific experience this verbalises and many thousands of children will gothrough that same nightmare all over the world today and every day.

Human robots -mind controlled slaves - havebeen with us for thousands of years and it is an epidemic today. As Fritz Springmeierand Cisco Wheeler say in their detailed investigation into mind control:“The basic techniques were developed in German, Scottish, Italian, and English familiesand have been done for centuries. Some report that techniques go back to ancient Egyptand ancient Babylon to the ancient mystery religions. The Nazis are known to have studiedancient Egyptian texts in their mind control research. The records and secrets of thegenerational bloodlines are very well guarded secrets.”1Control of the human mind and emotions is the very foundation of the reptiliancontrol of the human race. Control a person’s mind and you control them. The externalmanipulation of the mind takes many forms and the question is not how many are mindcontrolled, but how few are not. Every time you allow a newspaper, news programme,or manipulating advertisement to affect your perceptions and decisions, you are beingmind controlled. The emergence of today’s vast network of mind control centres andoperations can be traced back to the British Army’s Directorate of PsychologicalWarfare commanded by Brigadier General John Rawlings Rees. This interlocked withthe Tavistock Clinic which was founded in 1920 under the direct support of the Britishroyal family through the Duke of Kent. Later came the Tavistock Institute of HumanRelations in London and this is the centre of a global web which includes the StanfordInstitute in the United States. The aim of these organisations is the control of humanityvia the external manipulation of the mind. Rawlings Rees was a vehement racist andsupporter of the eugenics ‘master race’ movement. He studied ‘war neuroses’ duringWorld War I and he believed that by using the right conditions neurotic behaviour couldbe stimulated and controlled. He wrote in his book, The Shaping Of Psychiatry By War,published in 1945, that the Tavistock Group had demonstrated during the Second WorldWar that there was a ‘psychopathological tenth’ of the population who were geneticallystupid. The numbers of these people had to be controlled, he said, to protect civilisedsociety and it was necessary to take steps, including the use of psychiatry, to prevent"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"313their increase in numbers - especially in the backward colonial countries whichthreatened the civilised world. This was the usual reptilian-Aryan bullshit and HenryKissinger, David Rockefeller, and Adolf Hitler, could not have put it better. RawlingsRees said there was another ten per cent of the population whose genetic superiorityand psychological training made them suitable to occupy the seats of power (thereptilians and their crossbreeds). The other eighty per cent between these two extremescould, he suggested, be useful servants to the genetic elite if their neuroses could becontrolled. Rawlings Rees wanted to see psychiatrists involved throughout society, inthe home, at work, and in schools, and he arranged for the Tavistock group to train whathe called the ‘shock troops’, the psychiatrists posing as ‘advisors’ to the business,military, political, and educational management. Their job was, and is, to shape the waypeople think in the educational, political and business sectors and therefore control thedirection of the world. I was told by a member of the House of Lords in Britain that DrDavid Owen, now Lord Owen (Bil, TC), the British Foreign Secretary in the 1970s,founder of the Social Democratic Party, and peace negotiator for the European Union inBosnia, was trained at Tavistock, but I have not yet been able to confirm this orotherwise at the time of writing.In 1947, Rawlings Rees took his ‘vision’ to the United Nations and formed theWorld Federation of Mental Health with Montegu Norman, the Governor of the Bank ofEngland who had funded and manipulated Adolf Hitler and the Nazis to power. Asusual, dozens of affiliated, and centrally controlled organisations with an identicalagenda were formed around the world. In each country these groups targeted people formind manipulation that ensured their unquestioning service to the Brotherhood Agenda.Many of these people became the leaders of the Third World countries which, on thesurface, were winning their ‘independence’. In truth they continued to be controlled bythe same people as before. Running alongside this was the United Nations Social andCultural Organisation under the leadership of another Brotherhood mind programmer,Julian Huxley. The late Dr Fred Wills, the Foreign Minister of Guyana, summed up thesituation brilliantly when he said the United Nations was the world’s largest,continuously-run, brainwashing programme for leaders of developing countries. Thesame applies to the leaders of the industrial countries too, who also have their mindsplayed with before they are allowed to enter the positions of political and economicpower. Rawlings Rees’s protege, Eric Trist, was involved in a Tavistock project to‘restructure’ the thinking of business management. This plan included breaking thepower of the trades union movement and manipulating the thinking of top management.Among the corporations who hired Tavistock to do this were Shell, Unilever, the coalindustry (then government owned), and a number of the leading financial institutions.Major corporations today use ‘psychologists’ and they employ ‘facilitators’ or ‘groupleaders’ to run business meetings. What are they really there for? And who are theyworking for? This all fits into the Tavistock plan to have ‘psychiatrists’ at every level ofsociety hiding behind other job descriptions. Tavistock was behind the drug culture ofthe 1960s and the hippie movement and it was they who controlled the purveyors of the"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"314‘tune in, drop out’ philosophy. This was underpinned by the Brotherhood-CIA operationwhich made the drug LSD widely available. They are constantly in search of morepowerful techniques to imprison the human race in complete servitude. Aldous Huxley,a Tavistock agent, and guru of the 60s ‘revolution’, revealed the agenda at a lecture tothe California Medical School in San Francisco in 1961. He said:“There will be in the next generation or so a pharmacological method of making peoplelove their servitude and producing dictatorship without tears so to speak. Producing a kindof painless concentration camp for entire societies so that people will in fact have theirliberties taken away from them, but will rather enjoy it, because they will be distracted fromany desire to rebel - by propaganda, or brainwashing, or brainwashing enhanced bypharmacological methods. And this seems to be the final revolution.”We are at that very point today. The work of John Rawlings Rees was continued byother Tavistock operatives such as Dr Kurt Lewin as Tavistock developed ever moresophisticated techniques for the individual and mass control of the human mind. Thesehave increased the speed at which humanity has become unthinking and robotic.Tavistock became the centre of a global network as unlimited funds were madeavailable through ‘charity’ trusts sponsored by the British royal family and fromfamiliar sources like the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, the Mellons, and the Morgans.Tavistock created ‘terrorist’ groups are used to create conflict and turmoil in countrieswhere the Brotherhood want to change the government or justify the imposition of‘peace-keeping’ troops. In the 1950s, Brigadier General Frank Kitson commanded aTavistock project which used mind control and torture techniques on prisoners inBritish prisoner of war camps in Kenya. These robots were then released to penetrategroups opposing British control, destroy them from the inside, and kill their leaders.Others formed their own groups to fight the genuine ones and so Kenyan was fightingKenyan. This is why the SAS are operating in Africa and South America today underthe cover of the World Wide Fund for Nature and the ‘security’ organisations, as I shalldocument. This has happened in Algeria, Rwanda, Burundi, the Congo, the list seemsendless. The same Brigadier General Frank Kitson who created such conflict and terrorin Africa was sent to Northern Ireland in 1970 to launch the initial bombing and murdercampaign which triggered the Northern Ireland conflict that still continues today. Suchconflicts all over the world lead to demands that something must be done and that‘something’ is always further centralisation of power. It is not surprising to learn,therefore, that Eric Trist launched the Tavistock operation in the 1980s designed to useits enormous international network to programme the collective psyche to accept aworld government.In 1991, the Tavistock journal, Human Relations, reported on the world governmentproject. The collapse of the Soviet Union (orchestrated by the Brotherhood) had createdgreat opportunities for world government and the end of the nation state, the report said.It proposed a reformation of the United Nations to hand over all operations to a network"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"315of hundreds of thousands of (centrally controlled) ‘non-governmental organisations’.These would operate across national borders and not be subject to any control byelected governments. All this is a systematic plan to impose the will of the reptilians onthe collective human mind and it has constantly gathered pace since the 1950s. After theSecond World War the Brotherhood emphasis changed from control of territory tocontrol of minds and finances. People will eventually rebel against occupation of theirland, but it’s very much more difficult to identify, and therefore resist, occupation oftheir minds and their financial choices. Winston Churchill told an audience at HarvardUniversity on September 6th 1943, that to control what men think offered far betterprizes than taking away other people’s lands or provinces or grinding them down inexploitation. The empires of the future, he said, would be the empires of the mind. LordBertrand Russell said in his 1957 book, The Impact Of Science Upon Society, that whenthe techniques of mind control had been perfected, every government that was in chargeof education for more than one generation would be able to control its subjects securelywithout any need for armies or policemen. That is what ‘education’ is doing to ourchildren today.Along with the British Psychological Warfare Department and the Tavistockoperation, research also expanded rapidly under the fascists in Germany and Italy. JosefMengele, ‘the Angel of Death’, conducted mind control experiments on thousands oftwins under the supervision of Heinrich Himmler at the Kaiser Wilhelm MedicalInstitute in Berlin. Mengele was born into a rich Satanic reptilian bloodline. He was anexpert in demonology and the Cabala and was at least a Grand Master in the Illuminati,though probably much higher.2 As the camp ‘doctor’ at the Auchwitz ConcentrationCamp run by I. G. Farben, he was able to experiment on countless thousands of inmates.When the Allied armies were closing in on Germany in 1945 the British-United StatesIntelligence operation called Project Paperdip was launched to allow Mengele and theElite Nazi leadership, ‘scientists’, ‘doctors’, and military personnel to escape. Mengeledisappeared from Auchwitz in January 1945, and the public were led to believe he hadescaped to South America. In fact, he travelled world-wide, working at both theTavistock Institute in London and in the United States where he was known as Dr.Green or Greenbaum.3 The official records in Germany detailing Mengele’s mindcontrol research were taken by the Americans at the end of the war and the millions ofsheets of paper involved are still stored in the Suitland Annex in Washington DC wherethey are kept under strict security. Most of Mengele’s research gleaned in theconcentration camps is still classified.4 Researcher Fritz Springmeier established thenames of a number of people who had security clearance to access these files and everyone was connected to the Brotherhood networks, including the Illuminati. Many otherdocuments have been destroyed and in the bowels of the CIA headquarters at Langley,Virginia, just across the river from Washington DC, is a basement area known as the Pitwhere documents are shredded around the clock.5Mind control survivors from this period recall Mengele’s spotless uniform and shinyboots which he wore during programming sessions. They remember his thick German"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"316accent, the space between his front teeth, and the way he jabbed with his thumb.6 As inthe concentration camps of Germany, he often had German shepherd dogs to frightenchildren in his programming sessions. Coordinating Project Paperdip and thesubsequent mind control programmes in the United States were the Dulles brothers,cousins to the Rockefellers, both Satanists, reptilians, and Nazis to their core. JohnFoster Dulles became the US Secretary of State after the war while his brother AllenDulles was appointed to head the new Central Intelligence Agency, the CIA. From thisinflux of Nazi mind-doctors into the United States came the now notorious andunspeakable mind control programmes known as MKUltra. MK stands for mindcontrol; they used the German spelling of kontrolle in deference to the German Naziswho inspired the methods and techniques. It was headed, officially, by Ewen Cameron,an extremely sick individual, and a member of one of the Elite Scottish reptilianbloodlines. His favourite book as a child was Frankenstein which, he said, inspired himto follow a career in psychiatry. From his base in Montreal, Canada, he coordinated theinfamous MKUltra mind control operation with funding from familiar names like theRockefellers and he had regular meetings with Allen Dulles and the CIA. One ofCameron’s institutions administered 60,000 electrical shocks to patients in one yearalone: 1961. Cameron’s code name was ‘Dr White’ and indeed colour was part of hisresearch. He was trying to discover how to make brown eyes blue. Can it really be acoincidence that the country singer, Crystal Gayle, who is reported to be a mindcontrolled slave,7 made a hit record called Don’t It Make Your Brown Eyes Blue?Many of the rituals and methods employed in the mind control projects are inspiredby the ancient mystery schools. Admiral Stanfield Turner, the Director of the CIA,admitted publicly in 1977 that millions of dollars had been spent studying voodoo,witchcraft and psychics, and at the Senate hearing on August 3rd 1977, he said that theCIA had been mind controlling countless people without their consent or knowledge.MKUltra had involved at least 185 scientists, 80 US institutions, among them prisons,pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, and 44 medical colleges and universities. Some700 drugs are used by the Babylonian Brotherhood’s mad professors in their mindcontrol projects to create their human robots. This is why so many drugs were found atthe Jonestown Compound in Guyana in 1978 when ‘cult’ members were murdered intheir hundreds. The People’s Temple ‘cult’ was created by CIA operative, Jim Jones. Itwas not a new religion as portrayed in the media, it was a mind control experiment. Seethe chapter Cult or Con in .. And The Truth Shall Set You Free. Drugs have been usedsince ancient times to mind manipulate people and take them into altered states ofconsciousness. They can also suppress the will and allow what is called ‘demonicpossession’. The CIA-British Intelligence networks fund drug research (in other wordsthe public do) to find more and more effective ways of suppressing consciousness andwill. This includes vaccinations, food additives, and electromagnetic techniques. One ofthe centres involved in drug research for the CIA is the California Medical Facility atVacaville where the work was done by Dr Arthur Nugent. Countless experiments havebeen carried out and continue to be so. They include the use of mind controlling drugs"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"317on servicemen at the Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland (since exposed in atelevision documentary). One of the experiments is in Haiti where the Vodoun cult, aCIA-front, has turned most of the people into little more than zombies. Prozac is a drugthat constantly appears in research into these matters and it is not confined to individualmind control projects, it is being issued like confetti by doctors who serve the profitsand ambitions of the drug cartel instead of their patient’s wellbeing. It is one of theworld’s most prescribed drugs for depression and, as I write, Eli Lilly is seekingapproval to market a version of Prozac for children in peppermint and orange flavours.Already some 400,000 youngsters under 18 are being treated with Prozac in the UnitedStates alone and that is just the start. This is a mass mind control operation we areseeing here, creating a race of zombies like the ones in Haiti. Eli Lilly is closelyconnected to the Morgan and Rockefeller networks, US Intelligence, and George Bush.Other pharmaceutical companies involved in drug research for the mind control projectsinclude: Sterling Drug (a spin-off from Hitler’s I. G. Farben) which is connected to thebloodline family, the Krupps, the CIA’s Tinker Foundation, and the Order of St John ofJerusalem; and Monsanto Chemical Company where the president Earle H. Harbison Jris also president of the Mental Health Association and director of the infamousBethesda General Hospital where slaves are programmed for a mind control operationcalled Project Monarch.8 Monsanto is heavily involved with genetically manipulatedfood.Trauma-based mind controlProject Monarch is one of the many offshoots of MKUltra, a programme which, despiteofficial denials, is not only continuing today under other names, it has massivelyexpanded. The foundation of these projects world-wide is a technique called trauma-based mind control and now we can see how the Satanic networks fit into this picture.The mind has a defence mechanism which compartmentalises the memory of extremetrauma. This is why people cannot remember serious road accidents. Their mind createsan amnesiac barrier around the event so they don’t have to keep reliving such horriblememories. From ancient times this has been understood by the Brotherhood. In theconcentration camps of Nazi Germany the methods of exploiting this phenomena formind control were further perfected. Mengele and the Nazis realised that if you couldsystematically traumatise someone through torture, sexual abuse, and by sacrificing andtorturing others as they watched, you could shatter a person’s mind into a honeycombof self-contained compartments or amnesiac barriers. Satanic rituals are widely used todo this. Once the mind’s unity has been shattered, these various compartments, eachunaware of the other’s existence, can be programmed for various tasks or experiences.Using trigger words and hypnotic keys, sounds, or signals, these compartments can bepulled forward and pushed back like a mental filing cabinet. One self containedcompartment or fragment of mind becomes the person’s conscious level and it is thenreturned to the subconscious and another compartment accessed. This means that afterthe victim has performed a task they forget what they have done and who with. This"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"318condition has become known as Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD) or DissociativeIdentity Disorder (DID). The latter is more accurate because the compartments are not‘personalities’ as such, they are fragments of mind which have disassociated, becomedetached from, the rest of the consciousness. It is like moving a radio dial across thestations, the compartments, tuning into one and then another. Even this technique isprimitive compared with the latest methods. I knew from my research that there is anobsession among Satanists and paedophiles with having anal sex with young girls, aswell as boys, and the British therapist, Vera Diamond, told me that this is a way ofcreating multiples. Anal penetration is so painful to a child that it sends a surge ofenergy up the spine which explodes in the brain, causing further ‘personality’ splitting.It is called vaso-vagal shock. She showed me a painting by a female victim of this and itportrayed a surge of white energy rising from the bottom of the spine and exploding inall directions in her head. So even anal sex has an ulterior motive for those whounderstand its mental and emotional effect.Most people are MPD or ‘multiples’ to an extent because we are all shutting out whatwe would rather not face, but we are talking here about an extreme and calculated versionof it. Many soldiers become multiples when they witness unimaginable slaughter, as theirmind walls off the memory and they have no recollection of what they saw. TraugottKonstantin Oesterreich, a professor at Tubingen University in Germany, wrote a classicstudy of Multiple Personality Disorder and ‘demonic possession’ in 1921 calledPossession, Demonical And Other. This revealed that trauma-based mind control was beingused in France, Germany and Belgium long before the dawn of the 20th century. Survivorsand professionals have told of how the British used agents programmed through MPD inthe First World War.9 Although the trauma may be forgotten, subconsciously it is stillaffecting them and their lives, physically, mentally, and emotionally. Many people who aresexually abused and systematically traumatised as children appear mentally and physicallyunstable, especially if the programming has stopped and the compartment walls begin todismantle. I have sat in on sessions with the British therapist, Vera Diamond, and seenpeople switch between vastly different ‘personalities’, one after the other, by the use of asingle word or sentence. It is incredible to experience. One of her clients has to be attachedto a plastic bag which collects her urine because her bladder has been destroyed by torture.Her medical records are so enormous it shocked a doctor who saw them. When I met her,this lady was just 30... 30... years of age. In the UK the psychologists, social workers, andpolice, glean their knowledge of Multiple Personality Disorder from the Tavistock groupwhich claims to be the authority on treating the problem while secretly using it toprogramme people. Dr William Sargant, a psychiatrist at the Tavistock Institute, wrote inhis 1957 book, Battle For The Mind:“Various types of belief can be implanted in many people after brain function has beendeliberately disturbed by accidentally or deliberately induced fear, anger or excitement. Ofthe results caused by such disturbances, the most common one is temporarily impairedjudgement and heightened suggestibility. Its various group manifestations are sometimes"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"319classed under the heading of “herd instinct”, and appear most spectacularly in wartime,during severe epidemics, and in all similar periods of common danger, which increaseanxiety and so individual and mass suggestibility.”There you have another reason why the public are fed a constant diet of eventswhich induce fear, anger or excitement. Once again, the knowledge of this is not new, itis just more widely used and focused today. People, or rather zombies, in a programmedstate are used for many things. They are activated to carry out assassinations, as withthe killers of John Lennon and Robert Kennedy. Sirhan Sirhan, the mind controlledpuppet alleged to have murdered Robert Kennedy in 1968, was on a ‘mind expansion’course with the Rosicrucians when he began to hear messages telling him to killKennedy. I detail the background to this in .. And The Truth Shall Set You Free. We cannow see why so many assassinations are performed by people with the same mentalprofile - the so-called ‘lone nutters’. They are neither alone nor, in most cases, insane ifthey were allowed to live in their natural state. They are programmed people, oftensince childhood. By this method, you can use these mind controlled robots to plant aterrorist bomb and then ensure they are in the right place at the right time to be accusedand charged with the outrage. You can also program that person’s mind while incustody to make sure that he even thinks he was involved. The infamous CIA mindcontroller called Dr Louis Jolyon ‘Jolly’ West, who features strongly in .. And The TruthShall Set You Free, gave a ‘mental examination’ to Timothy McVeigh, the microchippedformer US soldier who was convicted of the Oklahoma bombing. West was deeplyinvolved in MKUltra and one of his keenest supporters was the then Governor ofCalifornia, later President of the United States, Ronald Reagan.We have seen a spate of ‘lone nutters’ in many countries who commit mass murder bygoing apparently crazy with guns. In the United Kingdom we have had horrendousexamples of this in the little towns of Hungerford in Berkshire in 1987 and Dunblane inScotland on March 13th 1996. A ‘nutter’ called Thomas Hamilton walked into a schoolin Dunblane and opened fire on little children in a gymnasium. He killed 16 five and sixyear olds and a teacher. The effect on the collective psyche of hundreds of millions ofpeople across the world, especially of course, in the UK, was devastating. Shortly afterthat came the massacre in Port Arthur, a small town in Tasmania, Australia, when anotherlone gunman called Martin Bryant went ‘crazy’ on April 28th 1996 and killed 35 people.This was followed in England by a guy attacking children and their teachers with amachete at a school in Wolverhampton. In March 1998 came ‘America’s Dunblane’when two youngsters, Mitchell Johnson aged 13, and his cousin, 11-year-old AndrewGolden, opened fire on their school friends and teachers at the Westside Middle Schoolin Jonesboro in Arkansas, just 130 miles from Bill Clinton’s political base at Little Rock.27 shots were fired killing four students and a teacher and wounding eieven others.Often reports emerge after these events that some of the killers were involved inSatanism. Similar incidents happened in Pearl, Mississippi, on October 1st 1997, and inDecember the same year at West Paducah, Kentucky, and Stamps, Arkansas. Again, it"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"320was claimed hat those involved in Pearl had been taking part in Satanism. There havebeen many more since. These events have all the hallmarks of mind control operations.So what goes on here?Look at the profiles of many of these people. Most have a background of being a bitstrange, troubled or simple - “Not the full quid”, as neighbours described the PortArthur killer, Martin Bryant. This is perfect when you want them and their horrors to bedismissed as the work of a lone nutter. In Bryant’s case, he had apparently just returnedfrom a two week stay in the United States when he went berserk with his gun. Peopleclose to him said his character had changed after he came back from the US, althoughhe had a long history of psychiatric problems and Bryant was a creation of the globalmind control centre at Tavistock in London. He was ‘examined’ in 1983-84 byTavistock’s Dr Eric Cunningham Dax, who decided on his future ‘treatment’. Dax wasfor decades a close associate of Dr John Rawlings Rees, the inspiration for theTavistock brainwashing operation. It has been shown that terrorist groups like the IRAhave what they call ‘sleepers’, people who lie low unused for years, even decades, untilcircumstances occur in which they and their cover can be exploited for a particular task.It is the same in this world of mind control. There are people programmed to live in thecommunity with a certain character profile until the time comes when they can be used.They are known in the ‘trade’ as ‘dead eyes’. They have no idea that they are beingused in this way because they are not in control of their minds, their programmers are.There are so many unanswered questions, interestingly, about why the Dunblane killer,the Freemason Thomas Hamilton, was allowed to legally keep guns when his strangebehaviour should have ensured his licence was refused. And why did the police in PortArthur take an hour to respond when the scene of the massacre was close to the policestation and they had been informed within minutes of Bryant’s first shot? Also, Bryant,Hamilton, and so many other people who commit such outrages are reportedly takingProzac. Side effects include nervousness, anxiety, suicidal tendencies, hypomania, andviolent behaviour when the drug is withdrawn. Doctors are warned not to prescribeProzac to anyone with a history of ‘mania’. A number of people involved in massshootings in the United States have been taking this drug. Traces of the activeingredient of Prozac were also found in the blood of Henri Paul, the driver of PrincessDiana’s Mercedes when it crashed in Paris in 1997.So what is the motivation behind these gun massacres? The manipulation of themind and emotions. Where did these mass murders take place? Not in the ganglandareas of London, Glasgow, Los Angeles, or Sydney, but in quiet little communitieswhere everyone felt perfectly safe. In the same way, the ‘McVeigh’ bomb and theschool shootings did not happen in New York or Washington, but in Oklahoma. Wewould be advised not to underestimate the effect on the collective psyche in terms offear and a desire for the authorities to ‘protect’ people from that fear. That means morecameras in the streets and more security guards and cameras in schools so that childrenare brought up to accept the culture of being ‘protected’ from danger by ‘Big Brother’authority. A front page headline in, I think, the London Daily Mail encompassed the"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"321very reaction the manipulators wanted to stimulate. It said after the Australia killings:“Is nowhere in the world safe anymore?” When these things happen in quietcommunities, it encourages even more powerfully the response of “My God, this couldhappen to me and my children - hey, we need protecting”. A traumatised mind is farmore susceptible to mind manipulation. The Brotherhood want to remove all guns fromthe general population in preparation for their final coup d’etat. No-one wants to rid theworld of weapons more than me, but we need to ask about the motivation behind theimmense pressure for gun laws inspired by... Hungerford, Dunblane, Tasmania,Oklahoma, etc, etc. Problem-reaction-solution. Getting hold of illegal weapons is soeasy that gun laws would not stop anyone who really wanted to kill. The gun used byMartin Bryant in Port Arthur was stolen and he had no licence. Gun laws would nothave stopped that, but the reason such laws are being introduced all over the world is toprevent the population from defending themselves when the order goes out to round upthose who are challenging the Agenda. In the UK the distraught parents who lostchildren in Dunblane were sickeningly and callously used to spearhead anti-gunlegislation by the very people who orchestrated the murder of their loved ones. I don’tthink I would use a gun, but who knows what a person would do in certaincircumstances? My instincts are that I don’t see the point of using violence to opposeviolence, but many people would and the Brotherhood know that. For this reason theywant an unarmed population. Adolf Hitler introduced gun laws shortly before he beganto transport people to his concentration camps. Similar camps, or ‘holding facilities’,have already been built in the United States by an organisation called FEMA, theFederal Emergency Management Agency, which was set up by Zbigniew Brzezinski, ashape-shifting reptilian, and the man who launched the Trilateral Commission withDavid Rockefeller. FEMA is headed by James Lee Witt and I would advise you to takea look at his eyes if you get the chance on television and ask yourself what they remindyou of.Mind controlled human robots are also used to pass messages between peopleoutside the normal channels. These include unofficial communications between worldleaders and between personnel within the Brotherhood-controlled illegal drugs networkwhich involves presidents of the United States and many other world leaders andofficials. People programmed through Multiple Personality Disorder apparently developa photographic memory. The words of the communication are dictated under a form ofhypnosis and then compartmentalised, often using a high voltage stun gun which lowersblood sugar levels and makes the person more open to suggestion. Later a trigger word,sentence, or action, activates that ‘personality’ compartment and the human robotrepeats the message word for word like a recorded tape. I have no doubt that manyworld leaders are themselves under the influence of mind control by their handlers and Iam convinced that the UK Prime Minister, Tony Blair, with his distant eyes and fixedsmile, is under some sort of mental influence. People look at some of the people I nameand say: “But he seems such a nice chap, he’d never do that”. The point to remember isthat the minds of these people, including many prime ministers and presidents, are"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"322compartmentalised and they can be switched from one mode to another. They are not onepersonality, but multiples of them and we need to appreciate this if we are going to followthe plot. Their closest friends won’t realise that what they see is only one compartment oftheir mind. If they saw them switched to another compartment, they would not recognisethem as the person they think they know. Mind controlled ‘multiples’ are also used toinfiltrate organisations the Brotherhood wish to discredit and destroy. Once on the insidethey are triggered to behave in ways that turn public opinion against the organisation.Mind controlled robots, including very small children, provide bizarre sex forpresidents, foreign leaders, politicians, and businessmen. Often this is done to encouragethese leaders into the Brotherhood’s way of thinking or to compromise and blackmailthem into doing as they are told. When I say bizarre, I mean it and I don’t find theinformation that follows easy to write or speak about. But it is so important that this veilis lifted, not least for those who are being subjected now, this minute, to some of thisgrotesque torture. For the most obvious of reasons, these human robots are rarely able totalk about what has happened to them. They are either in zombie mode and can’tremember, or, when they are past their sell by date from the Brotherhood’s perspective,they are murdered and sometimes their body parts used for black magic rituals attendedby some very famous people. You think you know the personalities of people you see onthe television? Please read on. Fortunately, one very brave woman who was mindcontrolled as a young child has spoken out after escaping from US government slaveryShe was taken through long and painful deprogramming sessions lasting more than ayear which dismantled compartments in her mind and allowed her to remember whathappened to her - and who did it. She is Cathy O’Brien, an American of Irish decent,who together with Mark Phillips, has produced a self-published book about herexperiences called Trance Formation Of America.10 It is a stunning tale that she has totell, but there have been millions more like her (still are) and that will continue to be thecase until humanity wakes up to its responsibilities. Cathy describes in great detail theconversations she heard, the rooms and decor in the White House, the Pentagon, and topsecret military establishments across the US. She can also describe physical details of thepeople involved which she could only know if she had seen them naked. There are anumber of researchers who question some of the details in Trance Formation Of Americaand, as always, I have many questions myself. But the themes and many of the names inCathy’s book have come up again and again in the accounts of other recovering mindcontrolled slaves and in the research of myself and many others. Her story is a summaryof what is happening all over the world so I will tell it at some length.Cathleen (Cathy) Ann O’Brien was born in 1957 in Muskegon, Michigan. Her fatherEarl O’Brien is a paedophile and one of Cathy’s first memories was being unable tobreathe because his penis was in her mouth. Such trauma automatically triggersMultiple Personality Disorder without any need for programming because the child’sown mind wishes to shut out the horror. Her father’s friends were also allowed to abuseand rape the young Cathy and her brothers, just as her father and mother had beenabused as children. Her mother was sexually abused by Cathy’s grandfather, the leader"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"323of a Masonic Blue Lodge. Her mother’s brother, Uncle Bob to Cathy, was a pilot inAirforce Intelligence who claimed that he worked for the Vatican. Uncle Bob was also acommercial pornographer and Cathy’s father forced her and her older brother, Bill, totake part in pornographic films made for the local Michigan Mafia which wasconnected, she says, to the ‘porn king’ Gerald Ford, then a US representative. He wouldlater be the vice-president of the United States under Richard Nixon and president whenNixon was ousted by Henry Kissinger and company via Watergate. Ford also served onthe Warren Commission ‘investigating’ the assassination of President Kennedy anddecided the official version was true even though it was impossible. While CathyO’Brien was a little child at school, she says she was raped by Gerald Ford in the officeof the Michigan State Senator, Guy VanderJagt, who also raped her. VanderJagt wouldbecome the chairman of the Republican Party National Congressional Committee whichsupported the child rapist and murderer, George Bush, the Queen of England’s friend, inhis successful campaign to become President of the United States.Eventually, Cathy’s father was caught sending child pornography through the post -a film of young Cathy having sex with a boxer dog. To avoid prosecution, Cathy washanded over by her father to the United States Government and the Defense IntelligenceAgency. Her father was delighted with the deal because he was now immune fromprosecution and could continue his pornography and paedophile activities while theauthorities looked the other way. The agency was searching for sexually abusedchildren with Multiple Personality Disorder who came from families with a history ofintergenerational child abuse. They wanted the children for their studies into geneticmind control which operated under the title, Project Monarch, an offshoot of MKUltra.The name Monarch comes from the Monarch butterfly, more symbolism which relatesin part to the butterfly net. The man who arrived at Cathy’s house to give her father theultimatum to “Hand over your daughter or be prosecuted” was... Gerald Ford. Cathy’sfather was sent to Harvard University near Boston to be instructed in how to prepare hisdaughter for the mad professors of the government agencies. Cathy says in her book:..... in keeping with his government-provided instructions, my father began working me likethe legendary Cinderella. I shovelled fireplace ashes, hauled and stacked firewood, rakedleaves, shovelled snow, chopped ice, and swept - ‘because’, my father said, ‘Your littlehands fit so nicely around the rake, mop, shovel, and broom handles...’ By this time myfather’s exploitation of me included prostitution to his friends, local mobsters, and Masons,relatives, Satanists, strangers, and police officers....... Government researchers involved in MKUltra Project Monarch knew about thephotographic memory aspect of MPD/DID, of course, as well as other resultant‘super-human’ characteristics. Visual acuity of an MPD/DID is 44 times greater than that ofthe average person. My developed unusually high pain threshold, plus compartmenta-lisation of memory, were “necessary” for military and covert operation applications.Additionally, my sexuality was primitively twisted from infancy. This programming was"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"324appealing and useful to perverse politicians who believed they could hide their actionsdeep within my memory compartments which clinicians refer to as personal ities.”11All these methods of trauma, and others I will reveal, are not just gratuitous torture.For example, heavy exercise with little sleep causes the overproduction of endorphinsin the brain and this makes the person start to robotically react to commands.12 This ispart of the training methods in the military, of course, which is nothing more than aschool for mind control. The “Yes sir” mentally is pure mind control and subordinationto the will of another. Soldiers are not encouraged to think and question, only to do asthey are told. You want to be mind controlled? OK, simple - join the military. Thesexual theme of the programming and abuse is also inspired by the manipulation ofsexual energy, the creative force, and at the point of orgasm the mind psyche is wideopen to access other higher or lower dimensions, depending on the state of being ofthose involved. These mind control programmers have high-tech equipment whichstimulate those parts of the brain which trigger the orgasm and so open the mind of thevictim to the lower ‘demonic’ dimensions, the reptilians. The programming techniquesare highly sophisticated and often very subtle. One common Monarch technique is the‘double bind’ in which you say two opposites in the same sentence to cause confusion:“Don’t believe any of this, it’s all true” is an example.13 Slavery is not confined tohistory. Slavery is happening all over the world today, including, no, especially, inBritain, the United States, and other ‘civilised’ countries. Paedophiles make the newsfrom time to time, but they are the tiniest tip of a massive network that goes right to thetop (sorry, gutter) of ‘free’ societies. The truth about the abuse of boys at the KincoraHome in Northern Ireland was suppressed because one of the abusers was an agent ofBritish Intelligence. It also involved at least one famous politician in Northern Ireland,but this fact has been covered up, not least by a now retired official of BritishIntelligence called Ian Cameron. Such child abuse networks provide the perfect vehicleto satisfy the sexual desires of those in control and for blackmailing those they wish tocontrol. I want to know the names of those involved in whatever country you live. Ifyou know something, please tell me. The information will be in the strictest confidenceand if it can be substantiated I will make it public. If you hesitate just think about thechildren being abused today, now, this minute.Cathy O’Brien says she was abused by Father James Thaylen when she soughtcomfort at a Roman Catholic Church called St Francis de Sales in Muskegon and anotherpriest, a Father Don, helped Gerald Ford’s friend, Guy VanderJagt, to confuse and abuseher in line with the ‘requirements’ of Project Monarch. Later she was sent to a RomanCatholic School, one of many used by the Brotherhood to safely house their mindcontrolled children under the strict regime designed to increase the depth of their MultiplePersonality Disorder. Her school was Muskegon Catholic Central High School where shewas raped by Father Vesbit many times, on one occasion during a Satanic ritual involvingother mind controlled boys and girls in his private chapel. The Roman Catholic Church isthe epitome of hypocrisy and deeply, deeply, sick. As this book has explained, it was the"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"325creation of the Babylonian Brotherhood from the start, back at the time of the RomanEmpire. The Roman Catholic Jesuit movement is an important vehicle for themanipulation of the global conspiracy. Like the Knights of Malta, who help to control theVatican, the Jesuit hierarchy does not even believe in Christianity! That’s just a front. Thewhole conspiracy is a lot of masks, mirrors and smokescreens. The Jesuits, the Knights ofMalta, and the Roman Catholic hierarchy are part of the Babylonian Brotherhood. Theywere, and are, keen supporters of mind control outrages like Project Monarch andMKUltra. How appropriate, given that the Roman Catholic Church has survived byterrifying, brainwashing, and mind controlling its global congregation. Cathy says shewas pressured and manipulated from a young age by the CIA’s Roman Catholic branchinto keeping secrets through a technique known as the Rite to Remain Silent. And therewere so many secrets to keep locked away in her compartmentalised mind.In the years that followed, she says she was under the control of the US ‘Democrat’,the senator for West Virginia, Robert C. Byrd, and her abuse by him and thegovernment agencies expanded. Byrd is a ‘constitutional’ expert working to undermineand destroy the best parts of the American Constitution. She claims that Byrd controls anetwork of mind controlled slaves and loves nothing more than to whip themmercilessly until they are close to death. One of Byrd’s associates, Senator PatrickLeahy of Vermont, would later torture Cathy by putting a needle in her eye while herdaughter, Kelly, was forced to watch, she writes in her book.14 Leahy was vice-chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and served on Byrd’s SenateAppropriations Committee. Leahy and Byrd played out a public game of ‘opposing’each other while actually working together to the same goals. The same masqueradegoes on in the parliaments of the world every day. Byrd, a cocaine addict,15 oftenbragged to ‘safe’ people of how he mind controlled President Jimmy Carter while hewas Carter’s ‘confidant and advisor’. The hypnotic voice of Byrd became the ‘voice ofGod’ to a praying and meditating Carter who faithfully followed the ‘guidance’ hebelieved was divine.16Cathy’s torture and mind control was inflicted at many government establishmentsaround the States, including the NASA Space and Rocket Centre at Huntsville, Alabama,where she and later her daughter, Kelly, were used for pornographic films. Yes - Man onthe Moon, Space Shuttle - NASA does all this. Religions are used constantly tomanipulate people and as a ‘respectable’ cover for torture and mind manipulation. Onecentre of Cathy’s mind programming was Salt Lake City, Utah, the headquarters of theMormon Church. Another establishment for mind controlling slaves is known as theCharm School at Youngstown, Ohio. This is a sex-slave ‘school’ where Cathy says she,Kelly and countless other women and children, were tortured and abused with electricshocks, sleep deprivation and sexual trauma. Cathy says an unnamed member of theMellon banking family (more close friends of the Windsors) was the ‘governor’ of theCharm School. Other well known people involved were US Representative Jim Traficantand Dick Thornburgh, then Governor of Pennsylvania and later US Attorney Generaland Secretary for the United Nations, Cathy writes.17 She, and so many others like her I"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"326have spoken with or read about, say that part of their torture programming took place atDisneyland in California and Disneyworld in Florida. The opening of the Disney park nearParis has given the opportunity for similar programming for mind-slaves in Europe. TheDisney company is a major Brotherhood operation and its films and theme parks areperfect for creating the illusions that confuse the mind of the multiple. Satanic rituals go onhere and trauma-based programming when the parks are closed, Cathy says. Children aretargeted for kidnapping here and the ones they want get ‘lost’ in the crowds. One obviousexample of a children’s story full of mind-programming symbolism is the MGM epic, TheWizard Of Oz. The word ‘Oz’ is short for Osiris, another theme of the programming. Someslaves have the ‘golden penis of Osiris’ placed upon them.18 The story of The Wizard Of Ozwas published in 1900 by Frank Baum, a member of Madam Blavatsky’s TheosophicalSociety, and it became a film in 1939. It is a mass of mystery school, Satanic and mindcontrol symbolism and Fritz Springmeier and Cisco Wheeler include a superb analysis ofthe story in their book, The Illuminati Formula Used To Create An Undetectable TotalMind Controlled Slave. Other programming centres include Las Vegas, Nevada, and itssurrounding area. The fantasy themes of the casinos in Vegas, like the MGM Grand, areused and one of the slave ‘auction’ sites is a remote spot 20 miles from the city.19While still a child, Cathy says that she was raped, abused and tortured by some veryfamous people. She says that she was raped by Pierre Trudeau, the long time PrimeMinister of Canada, who as a Jesuit, was working closely with the Vatican; she was rapedagain by Gerald Ford when he was actually President; raped by Ronald Reagan while hewas President; and raped many times in the most brutal fashion by Dick Cheney, the WhiteHouse Chief of Staff under Ford and the Defense Secretary of the United States underGeorge Bush. Cathy is able to describe Cheney’s office in the Pentagon in great detail. Ifyou accept her often highly detailed evidence you can only conclude that Cheney, likeBush, has an immensely imbalanced mind capable of staggering violence and murder.Cathy says that Cheney told her on one occasion: “I could kill you - kill you - with mybare hands. You’re not the first and you won’t be the last”.20 These were the characterswho launched the Gulf War to show that ‘violence does not pay’! Cheney, Bush, and othershave ‘fun’ playing something they call The Most Dangerous Game. It involves threateninggovernment slaves like Cathy and other mind controlled children and adults with appallingconsequences if they are caught. They are then allowed to ‘escape’ into a forest, usually insome top secret military area like Lampe, Missouri or Mount Shasta, California, which aresurrounded by a high fence to prevent any escape. George Bush, the man who called for a“kinder, gentler America”, Dick Cheney, and Bill Clinton often go after them with guns,Cathy says in her book and newspaper interviews. When they are caught, they are brutallyraped, sometimes killed, she says. The Mount Shasta compound, where Bush and Cheneyshared an office, is, according to Cathy: “The largest covert mind control slave camp ofwhich I am aware”.21 There she saw an enormous fleet of unmarked black helicopters,which, as researchers have revealed, are part of the Brotherhood’s private army which isbeing installed to instigate the coup d’etat against dissidents when the moment isdeemed right. These helicopters have often been reported near the scenes of ‘alien’"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"327abductions and cattle mutilations. Part of the cover for these military and mind controloperations at the Shasta compound, Cathy says, is the country music scene at Lake Shasta.Cathy says she was forced to marry a mind controlled Satanist called Wayne Cox, amember of the Jack Greene country music band. Greene, a CIA operative, was also aSatanist, she says.22 Cox’s job was to further traumatise her to create morecompart-ments which could be used to program new ‘personalities’, Cathy writes. Onenight, she says Cox took her with him to the ruins of the Union Railway Station inNashville and, using a flashlight, found a homeless man asleep. He ordered Cathy to“Kiss the railroad bum goodbye” and proceeded to shoot him in the head. That washorrific enough, but then he produced a machete and chopped off the man’s handsbefore putting them into a zipper bag.23 As Cathy has stated at public meetings manytimes, Wayne Cox is a serial killer who invariably chops off the hands of his prey. Thisis a Satanic signature. In an interview published in the Contact newspaper, Cathy said:“By 1978, Wayne Cox, my first designated controller, was actively ritually anddismembering bums, children, and those who “wouldn’t be missed” and blatantlydistributing body parts from his Chatham, Louisiana, home base to key Satanic capitals ofseveral states which included the “Little Rock-Missouri route.”24Government agencies know this, she says, but he is immune from prosecutionbecause he works for them. Cox led Cathy to another spot on the Union Station site, thetower at the old railway depot, and waiting in the room for them, she says,were JackGreene, members of his band and others, dressed in black robes. They were standingaround a black leather altar, she claims. She describes the room as being draped in redvelvet and lit by candles. Cathy was laid on the altar and subjected to rape and torturewhile the Satanists performed a black magic ritual that involved sex, blood, andcannibalism.25 Years later when ‘married’ to another CIA asset, Alex Houston, shewould be made pregnant and artificially aborted many times so the foetuses could beused for Satanic rituals, she says.Bohemian GroveThere is a sexual playground for leading American and foreign politicians, mobsters,bankers, businessmen, top entertainers, etc, who are initiates of the BabylonianBrotherhood. It is called Bohemian Grove, 75 miles north of San Francisco inCalifornia, near the hamlet of Monte Rio alongside the Russian River in SonomaCounty. I went to the area in 1997 to have a look around and when I told the hotelreceptionist where I was going she warned me to be very careful because some peoplewho had been to investigate had never been seen again. Here at Bohemian Grove,Cathy, and others I have interviewed, say they were forced to serve the perversions oftheir abusers. These include Satanic rituals, torture, child sacrifices, and blood drinking,which take place on the exclusive 2,700 acre estate in among the redwood trees. AsCathy says in her book: “Slaves of advancing age or with failed programming were"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"328ritually murdered at random in the wooded grounds of Bohemian Grove and I felt it wasonly a matter of time until it would be me”.26 She says the Grove has a number ofrooms for different perversions including a Dark Room, a Leather Room, a NecrophiliaRoom, and one known as the Underground Lounge, spelt as ‘U.N.derground’ on thesign. I’ve seen a covertly taken picture of robed men at Bohemian Grove standingalongside a large fire worshipping a 40 foot stone owl (see picture section). The owl isthe symbol of Moloch or Molech, an aspect of Nimrod/Baal. Moloch demands thesacrifice of children and it was to this deity that the children of the Babylonians,Hebrews, Canaanites, Phoenicians and Carthaginians, were sacrificially burned. Thispicture provided visual support for the claims over many years that Druid rituals werebeing performed at the Grove with people in red robes marching in procession chantingto the Great Owl, Moloch. The Romans called the owl by the same word that meantwitch. The Greeks said the owl was sacred to Athene, the ancient Mesopotamian ‘EyeGoddess’, and her staring owl-like images have been found throughout the MiddleEast.27 The owl was also the totem of Lilith, the symbol of the bloodline genes passedon through the female, and other versions of the triple goddess of the Moon. The owlhas been symbolised as a witch in bird form and is associated with witches in thesymbols of Halloween. The symbolism of being able to see in the dark and with a 360degree range of vision are also appropriate for a Brotherhood deity. These world famousBrotherhood initiates at Bohemian Grove burn a Celtic wicker effigy at the start of their‘camp’ to symbolise their ‘religion’. The population of Britain has been manipulatedinto doing the same every November 5th when effigies of Guy Fawkes are burned tomark the day on which he tried to blow up Parliament.A local community newspaper, The Santa Rosa Sun, reported in July 1993 about theCult of Canaan and the legend of Moloch at Bohemian Grove, but police investigationsinto alleged murders on the site have predictably led nowhere. Regular attendees atBohemian Grove are known as ‘grovers’ and among them are people like George Bush;Gerald Ford; Henry Kissinger; Dick Cheney; Alan Greenspan, the head of the FederalReserve; Jack Kemp (Bob Dole’s running mate at the 1996 US election); AlexanderHaig, the former Defense Secretary; Casper Weinberger and George Shultz, formerSecretaries of State; and a long list of the best known politicians, businessmen, mediapeople, and entertainers in the world, let alone America. Steve Bechtel, the head of theworld’s biggest construction company, attended Bohemian Grove in the 1980s while hiscompany enjoyed massive contracts thanks to the spending decisions of the World Bankand its president A. W. Clausen, another ‘grover’. According to researchers, there is awaiting list of some 1,500 people anxious to pay the initiation fee of $2,500 and annualdues of $600. This is a ‘summer camp’ and Satanic centre for the Elite who run theplanet and this is where many of the real decisions are made before they become public.I have a picture from 1957 of Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon sitting at a table atBohemian Grove listening to Dr Glenn Seaborg, who was involved in the discovery ofplutonium and worked on the Manhattan Project which produced the bombs that weredropped on Japan. Doctor Edward Teller, the ‘father of the H-bomb’, was also a"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"329member. Both Reagan and Nixon, part of this Elite Satanic club more than 40 years ago,would go on to become presidents of the United States. In fact, every Republicanpresident since Herbert Hoover in 1945 has been a member and most Democrats,including Bill Clinton.It was in Sonoma County, not far from Bohemian Grove, that 12-year-old PollyKlaas was murdered, quite obviously by Satanists, in October 1993. She was kidnappedfrom her bed while her mother and sister slept in the next room. Her grandfather, Joe,had publicly endorsed a book called Breaking The Circle Of Satanic Ritual Abuse bythe former Satanist, Daniel Ryder. It exposed the ties between Satanists and the mindcontrol programmes MKUltra and Project Monarch. While a man was reluctantlycharged with Polly’s murder, the facts point conclusively to a retaliation by theSatanists against her grandfather. A woman called the FBI to say she had escaped froma coven in Sonoma County and that Polly might be killed as part of a five-day SatanicHalloween Festival. She said Polly might be found near the Pythian Road on Highway12 which, coincidentally, is close to a 1,600 acre spread called the Beltane Ranch. TheFBI ignored this warning and Polly’s body was later found near the Pythian Road. Shehad been sexually assaulted and decapitated, but the authorities claimed she had beenstrangled. The man who kidnapped her, Richard Alan Davis, was not even charged withthe murder by the Sonoma County District Attorney’s office until they were forced toact by protests from police officers.One of those who controlled Cathy O’Brien was Lt Colonel Michael Aquino of the USArmy, a top man in the Defense Intelligence Agency’s Psychological Warfare Division. Ihave named him in my last three books as the head of a Satanic Church known as theTemple of Set, an organisation inspired by the leader of Hitler’s SS, Heinrich Himmler.When it was exposed that America’s psychological warfare was being headed by a neo-Nazi from a Satanic Church, the official response was that a man’s religion was his ownbusiness! But, as Cathy soon found out, people like Aquino and the rest of this disturbedand possessed bunch, are above the law, because their mentality controls the law right upto the President and beyond. Aquino’s wife, who works with him, is called Lilith Sinclair.Lilith is a symbol of the reptilian bloodlines and the Sinclair/St Clair bloodline you knowall about by now.28 She founded the Lilith Grotto within Anton LaVey’s Church of Satanand is a member of that Church’s Council of Nine.29 The term ‘Council of Nine’ is arecurring theme in the Satanism/Brotherhood structures. LaVey’s Church of Satan is agood example of the way Satanism and the mind control operations interlink. The UnitedStates has become the home for a stream of Satanic organisations inspired by those inEurope, the Middle East and elsewhere. New York and California have long been majorcentres for Satanism and the Brotherhood. California was settled in the early 20th centuryby Haitians who practised voodoo and Satanists from Europe, South America and Cubaalso headed for California and the San Bernandino Valley. Anton LaVey, student ofAleister Crowley, was the most famous of these and he founded the Church of Satan in1966. LaVey’s maternal grandmother came from Transylvannia, legendary home of theblood sucking ‘vampire’, and he loved horror movies. It was LaVey, it is claimed, who"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"330found Marilyn Monroe working in the strip clubs and used his contacts to make her amovie star. He has had connections with some of the biggest names in business, politicsand entertainment, including President John E Kennedy, Frank Sinatra, Sammy DavisJr, Peter Lawford, and Jayne Mansfield. Sammy Davis was an early member of LaVey’sChurch of Satan and Jayne Mansfield was a high priestess. Michael Aquino of the USPsychological Warfare Department worked with LaVey before they had a disagreementand Aquino launched his breakaway, Temple of Set. This is now, apparently, based inAustin, Texas, the political base of George W. Bush, the son of the man himself.Cathy conceived a child, Kelly, with her ‘husband’ Wayne Cox, and soon Kelly wasbeing used in the same way as her mother. She says that Kelly was raped many times byGeorge Bush and Dick Cheney. Bush’s Satanism and paedophilia are common themesof my research. In his book, The Franklin Cover Up: Child Abuse, Satanism, AndMurder In Nebraska, the Nebraska State Senator John W. DeCamp exposed a Satanicchild abuse ring in Omaha, headed by the top Republican, Lawrence King.30 It wasKing who sang the national anthem at the 1984 and 1988 Republican Conventions, butwas later jailed for stealing some $40 million from the Franklin Credit Union. It waswhile investigating this scam that DeCamp uncovered the Satanic ring which involvedlocal police chiefs and Harold Andersen the publisher of the local paper The OmahaWorld-Herald. Some of the paedophile ‘parties’ identified by DeCamp and his contactswere attended by... George Bush. Another Bush-related activity described byresearchers was Operation Brownstone. A Brownstone building in Virginia, close toWashington DC, was used to compromise politicians during the Bush presidency byproviding children for sex and filming what happened. Before he arrived for apresidential visit to Australia in December 1991, the publication Inside News asked thequestion: “Is George Bush the world’s leading child abuser?”. Bush’s abuse of childrenis well known to anyone who has cared to look and you don’t have to look far, either.Both Cathy and Kelly were forced to have sex with animals for videos made on theorders of President Ronald Reagan, Cathy says in her book. “Uncle Ron” liked nothingmore than to watch these videos and they were known as Uncle Ronnie’s Bed-timeStories.31 They were recorded and produced, Cathy says, by his pornographer, MichaelDante (also known as Michael Viti). She says that Dante had connections with theMafia and the CIA (same thing at their top levels), and was a close associate ofpoliticians like Guy VanderJagt, Gerald Ford, Dick Thornburgh, Jim Traficant, andGary Ackerman.32 It was Dante who installed the tiny hidden cameras which recordedthe sexual activities of US and foreign politicians so they could be blackmailed intosupporting the Brotherhood Agenda, Cathy recalls. How many ‘leaders’ today arefollowing certain policies against the interests of the people because if they didn’t, theevidence of their sexual exploits would be revealed. Cathy writes that Reagan’s leadingpornographer was a man called Larry Flynt of the pornography magazine, Hustler.33 Hewas the subject of a film called The People V Larry Flynt. He too has CIA, Mafia andVatican connections, she says.34 Bill Clinton was compromised in this way, on oneoccasion, by his boss, oops, sorry, ‘opponent’, George Bush, Cathy told an American"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"331alternative newspaper. It happened at the Lampe, Missouri, mind control facility knownas Swiss Villa. She says that Bush ordered her daughter, Kelly, to perform oral sex onClinton while Clinton was doing the same with Cathy. She recalls the followingexchange:“Clinton pushed his way out from under me and told Bush while he glanced around for thecamera: “You didn’t need to do that. I’m with you anyway. My position does not need to becompromised.” Clinton was apparently referring to the blackmail tactics amongst the Orderof the Rose elite. World leaders were always compromised through covertly filmed bizarresexual activity as was my experience at the Bohemian Grove.”35 (The Order of the Rose isanother exclusive secret society)After this encounter, Bush and Clinton, discussed introducing Clinton’s daughter,Chelsea, to the child abuse scene, Cathy says. Bush offered to “Open her up”. Clintonsaid he would have to discuss it with Hillary36 Clinton and his vice-president, Al Gore,were quite a pairing. Two former Satanists from different groups have said that Gore isaddicted to drinking blood.37 This makes sense because Arizona Wilder, the BrotherhoodMother Goddess who escaped from their clutches, told me how she has seen Gore atsacrifice rituals when he shape-shifted into a reptilian. Many Satanic initiates have thesame addiction to the adrenalchrome which is released in the body just before a person issacrificed.38 It is produced by the pineal gland during periods of terror. Cathy says thatshe and Kelly were raped by another Canadian Prime Minister, Brian Mulroney, who isaddicted to sex with mind controlled slaves.39 Mind controlled mothers and youngdaughters were, and are, regularly transported to Niagara Falls just over the Canadianborder for Mulroney to rape them.40 It was Mulroney in his period as Prime Ministerwho forced upon the Canadian people the North American Free Trade Agreement(NAFTA), which is set to become the Americas’ version of the European Union. Theagreement was manipulated into existence by his fellow rapist, George Bush, and laterby Bill Clinton. Under the orders of President Reagan’s personal attache, Philip Habib,Cathy says, she was forced to have sex on several occasions with the Brotherhoodstooge, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. The Saudi royal family serve as puppet leaders whilesuppressing their people with a brutal religion which they themselves do not even beginto observe. American mind controlled slaves are also ‘sold’ to Saudi Arabia, Mexico, andother countries to help fund the covert operations of the New World Order.Cathy was so powerfully mind controlled that she was ‘promoted’ to become what isknown as a Presidential Model, a mind controlled slave who is detailed to operate with thetop people in the White House and the Pentagon. She was used to pass messages betweenReagan, Bush and their foreign associates such as the dictators, Baby Doc Duvalier ofHaiti, President Miguel De La Madrid of Mexico and Manuel Noriega of Panama, a paidCIA operative working for the US government illegal drug trade. Cathy says she observedone party attended by Air Force officials and their wives, drug barons like the Pueto Rican,Jose Busto and the ‘hero’ (I feel ill) of the Iran-Contra drugs-for-arms scandal, Oliver"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"332North. Upstairs were Noriega, Michael Aquino, and Senator Allen Simpson, the‘Republican’ from Wyoming, she says.41 While all this was going on, George Bush washaving a “war on drugs” to “save the American children”. Cocaine addict Bill Clintonwould later do the same. Cathy says she met Clinton a few times and on one occasion inArkansas, he was trying (successfully) to persuade a supporter, Bill Hall, to becomeinvolved in the drugs trade. Hall need not worry, Clinton said, because it was “Reagan’soperation”. Cathy says that Clinton told Hall in her then mind controlled presence:“Bottom line is, we’ve got control of the (drugs) industry, therefore we’ve got control ofthem (suppliers and buyers). You control the guy underneath you and uncle (Uncle Sam,the United States Government) has you covered. What have you got to lose? No risk. No-one’s going to hang you out to dry. And whatever spills off the truck as it passes through(Clinton laughed here and snorted another nose4ull of cocaine) you get to clean up.”42Later that night, Cathy says, she was taken by Bill Hall’s wife to meet HillaryClinton at the Hall’s guest villa. There Mrs Clinton, another cocaine user,43 performedoral sex on Cathy and then insisted it was done to her.44 Both President Clinton andhis first lady knew Cathy was a mind controlled slave and they know what is goingon. So does Al Gore. They keep quiet because they are part of what is going on.Hillary Clinton is a sixth degree Illuminati witch and slave handler, according tosome researchers.45 Cathy acted as a robotic messenger for Clinton who was veryadept at triggering her programming, as she has stated publicly many times. Clintonand Bush may seem to be opponents in ‘different’ political parties, but they are partof the same scam. Cathy O’Brien says she has confirmed from her own directexperience what researchers like myself and others have been suggesting for years:Bush was President during the ‘Reagan years’, President through his own ‘official’period in the oval office, and pulled strings again during the ‘Clinton’ regime underorders from a higher authority. Cathy says she met Bush and Clinton together yearsbefore Clinton was even publicly considered a possible presidential candidate. Sheonce observed them at Swiss Villa at Lampe, Missouri. The ‘infirmary’ on the site ishome to a CIA near-death trauma centre, she says. Cathy, under mind control, haddelivered a large amount of cocaine there in a motorhome when she saw the twofuture presidents:“...I noticed then Governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton, at a corner table with Hillary talking tothe then vice-president George Bush, and their two special forces ‘toy soldiers’ (mindcontrolled) who had transferred the cocaine to the infirmary building. My mind controlowner, US Senator, Robert Byrd, told me that Bush and others had been grooming BillClinton for the presidency in the event that the American public became disillusioned withRepublicans and believe that electing a Democrat would make a difference. Clintonobediently followed Bush’s orders. Since the implementation of what Hitler termed ‘NewWorld Order’, knew no party lines, the question should be raised as to the agenda of"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"333Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign manager, James Carville, and his wife, Mary Matalin,who was Bush’s campaign manager. “46Another Clinton-Bush connection is their love of hunting mind controlled men, women,and children, in The Most Dangerous Game. Cathy describes one of her experiences atSwiss Villa when Clinton and Bush went hunting with dogs for herself, her daughter, Kellyand two mind controlled ‘toy soldiers’, one of whom had Italian-looking features:“Swiss Villa appeared deserted, except for Bill Clinton and George Bush who stood at theedge of the woods with their hunting dogs at the ready to embark on ‘The Most DangerousGame’ of human hunting. (Clinton shared Bush’s passion for traumatising and huntinghumans)... Bush and Clinton were dressed alike in camouflage pants, army boots, and windbreakers. The two also shared the trademark of wearing a cap of cryptic meaning. This time,Bush’s camouflage cap had an orange insignia which said ‘Dear Hunter’. Clinton’s blue capread: ‘Aim High’ and had a picture of a rifle on it. Clinton appeared awkward with his huntingrifle, while Bush looked like an expert marksman with his black rifle with elaborate scope.“‘The rules of the game are simple’ Bush began, triggering me by using the same wordsthat always preceded a most dangerous game.“Clinton interrupted: ‘You run. We hunt.’“Bush continued: ‘This will be called “Hunt for a Virgin”’(Clinton chuckled) ‘and she’s it.’ Hepointed to Kelly who was still in my arms. ‘I catch you, she’s mine.’“Clinton spoke up: ‘You’ll have plenty of time to play with the dogs because they’ll have youpinned down while we...’ (he slid a bullet in the chamber for emphasis) ‘...hunt down thebigger game.’ Clinton glared at the ‘toy soldier’ with the waxy face. Toy soldier was a term Ioften heard referring to the mind-controlled robotic ‘special forces’ young men whooperated under the New World Order.“The two guys ran for the woods. Carrying Kelly I began running, too. Judging from theclose proximity of the dogs barks, I had not gone far when they were turned lose. The fivebarking dogs caught me right away and surrounded me. Kelly screamed as one snappedat her leg and I automatically slapped at its face. I was convinced that the dogs were goingto tear us up by the time Bush and Clinton walked into the clearing. They seemed to beengaged in a serious conversation until Bush looked up and smiled.“‘She’s mine’, he claimed (referring to Kelly). ‘But then, she always has been. Let go.’“As I walked passed Clinton, who was deep in thought, he mumbled ‘I thought you’d befucking a dog or something’. We walked the short way back in silence with"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"334Clinton veering off to the right as Bush directed me toward the two helicopters. The door ofthe helicopter next to me slid open and Clinton pushed the Italian into the helicopter. ‘Icaught this one.

The powerful wind blew Bush’s greasystrands from his face as he gestured for the man (the Italian) to stand up.“‘Free fall’, Bush instructed. ‘That’s an order.’“‘Yes sir’ he replied as he stepped out of the door fully clad in his camouflage uniform andmilitary boots - with no parachute. I watched in horror as he fell to his death in the waterbelow, splatter and submerge...”47The United States might lose its freedom? My God. The United States has neverbeen free. The mind controlled slaves are programmed to mind control others and thereare now fantastic numbers of mind controlled children and adults at large. There arewhole armies of them like the Delta Force, the ‘toy soldiers’, in the United States andother ‘elite’ (often psychopathic) groupings like the SAS and the Parachute Regiment inthe United Kingdom. The name, Delta, symbolises the pyramid and also relates to theNile Delta and the ancient Egyptians. ‘Delta’ programming creates killers, assassins.The training alone for these people is classic mind control, never mind all the individualstuff they experience. The children being prepared to join the Delta Force later in lifeare put through indescribable horrors to desensitise them from pain and death, both forthemselves and others. One of the techniques to do this is to bond the child into a closerelationship with another child and then to incinerate their friend while they are forcedto watch. The Brotherhood know that to take over the world by open force eventuallythey must have a mind controlled army which would not be affected by what they do totheir fellow countrymen and even their own families. Why in wars like Bosnia and inmass murders like those in Algeria do people report how sons have slaughtered theirown families along with the rest of a village or community? Because they are mindcontrolled to do it, that’s why. It is the same with the ‘suicide bombers’ and other‘kamikaze’ operations. In the same way it is the mind controlled Elite, and their lowerlevel ‘gofers’, who are in the positions of political, business, military, administrative,media, and religious power in the world. To an untrained eye, such programming isundetectable, but these people are following a programmed Agenda. At a deep level,they are automatons controlled by reptilians."},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"335When the slaves outlive their usefulness or their programming begins to break down,they are murdered. The so-called Presidential Models like Cathy O’Brien are rarelyallowed to live beyond their 30th year and when that came for Cathy in 1987/88, shewas told it was her last year of life. Fortunately as her book explains, she and the theneight year old Kelly would be rescued from death by a businessman called MarkPhillips. He says he had considerable knowledge of advanced mind control techniquesfrom his time working for the Ampex Corporation and the US Department of Defenseas a civilian subcontractor. This gave him contact with the leading research scientists inthis field and he had access to knowledge that is denied to the mainstream psychiatricprofession, he writes in Trance Formation Of America. Psychiatrists, like doctors andscientists, are also mind-manipulated by the suppression of information which givesthem a distorted picture of what is possible. Mark Phillips says he was apparentlyregarded as ‘safe’ because of his background and security clearance and he wasapproached by a man called Alex Houston for support with a business deal. Houstonwas now the ‘handler’ of Cathy and Kelly and he married Cathy at the instruction of hercontroller, Senator Robert C. Byrd, their book says.48Alex Houston, a rapist, paedophile, and drug runner, according to Cathy, was anentertainer, a ventriloquist and stage hypnotist, who, she says, also had his mind andmouth worked by someone else - the US government’s mind control network. She saysit was his job to maintain her and Kelly in their programmed mode by following theinstructions he was given, which included food and water deprivation and constanttrauma. Houston used his travel to venues as a cover to transport Cathy and Kelly totheir ‘assignments’ and Cathy says this introduced her to the truth about the UnitedStates country music industry and, indeed, the entertainment industry in general.Country music, she discovered, was used by the Brotherhood’s US agencies todistribute massive amounts of drugs into American society and as a cover for its mindcontrol projects. It was these agencies, she says, which paid for the promotion and hypethat turned a singer called Boxcar Willie into a country music star. Some of thispromotion, Cathy says, took the form of high-tech television commercials designed tohave a hypnotic effect on the viewer. He became the leader, she writes, of the countrymusic segment of the ‘Freedom train’ - the internationally recognised code name for theslave operations of Project Monarch. The name Boxcar Willie was not selected atrandom, it would seem. It makes a statement about the man and his role. Cathy namesBoxcar Willie as a paedophile rapist of mind controlled women and children, includingKelly, who, she says, he raped regularly in three different mental institutions.49 He isalso heavily involved in the cocaine operations controlled by the government agencies,she says, and he was the man Bill Clinton’s friend, Bill Hall, began to work with afterClinton persuaded him to become involved.50 It was Boxcar Willie who inspired themoving of the country music ‘capital’ to Branson, Missouri, to be close to the CIA mindcontrol and drug operation based at Lampe, Missouri, according to Cathy in her book.51Many people in the entertainment industry are either connected with the conspiracyor mind controlled by it, she says. One of the latter was Marilyn Monroe, a lover of"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"336President John F. Kennedy. Both were to be murdered. The singer, Madonna, is a mindcontrolled slave according to Springmeier and Wheeler in their book on this subject.Springmeier says he was given a catalogue of the Vidimax occult porn video club basedin New Jersey which included a video involving Madonna. It sells videos of peoplebeing murdered (snuff videos), cannibalism and sacrifices.52 Springmeier and Wheelersay Madonna was a mind controlled slave given the name, Louise Chiccone, living inNew York East Village when a film was made of her being raped and the rapist beingtaken away and sacrificed. Vidimax sell this video apparently for $19 to theirmembers.53 If, as they say, Madonna is a multiple, she will most likely have norecollection of this. Elvis Presley, a member of the Theosophical Society, has beennamed as a multiple slave by survivors and Cisco Wheeler, herself a recovering slave,says that her experiences led her to believe this about Elvis. His handler was hismanager, ‘Colonel’ Tom Parker, she says.54 When Elvis died (if he did), the SunInternational Corporation released a Presley album called Orion with a winged sun-discon the cover. This is an ancient Egyptian and Sumerian symbol used by the Order of theOriental Temple and other Brotherhood groups. Barbara Streisand is a mind controlledasset of the Brotherhood, as revealed in detail by the recovered slave, Brice Taylor, inher book, Thanks For The Memories. Another mind controlled singer, according toCathy, is Lorretta Lynn, a slave of the CIA. Her mental and emotional problems arecaused by this, Cathy says. Lorretta’s road manager Ken Riley is a paedophile and bestfriend to Cathy’s handler, Alex Houston. Both were connected with US congressman,Gary Ackerman, the ‘Democrat’ from New York, who, Cathy reports, ran an elaboratedrug operation through Long Island docks.55 A mind controlled woman named by MarkPhillips is Seidina ‘Dma’ Reed, the daughter of actor-singer, Jerry Reed. Seidina hadbeen used many times with Cathy in pornographic films, he says, under the control ofher husband, the sadist, David Rorick, (also known as Dave Rowe). Rorick was trainedin mind control by Alex Houston and Seidina’s famous father Jerry Reed knew all aboutit, according to Mark Phillips. Seidina was a favourite sex slave of Prince Bandar binSultan, the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the US.56 The singer and actor KrisKristopherson, a drug-addicted alcoholic born into a CIA family, according to Phillips,is also involved as a seriously imbalapced controller and mind manipulator of slaves,Cathy recounts in her book and public statements.57 She writes that she was tortured byhim and Michael Aquino, using high voltage electric shocks.58 Kristopherson, a Jesuit,is an associate of Senator Robert C. Byrd, Cathy’s controller, she says. In that position,Byrd was, in mind control parlance, said to be ‘married’ to Cathy even though she wasofficially married to Alex Houston. Cathy says of Kristopherson in her book:... Kristopherson nearly strangled me to death with his penis which further sexuallyaroused him, late in the Summer of 1987 during another incident related to Byrd.”59A world famous psychopath and drug runner for the government, Cathy writes, is therock and roll legend, Jerry Lee Lewis, a friend of Elvis Presley. Cathy says she was"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"337threatened on many occasions with the words: “We’ll sell you to Jerry Lee”. FrankSinatra and JFK’s brother, Ted Kennedy, are reported by recovering slaves to have beenparticularly brutal, also. I spoke at a conference on mind control in the United Statesand met Brice Taylor who, like Cathy O’Brien, also became a Presidential Model. Herhandler from the time she was a little girl in southern California was the comedian, BobHope, a member of Bohemian Grove. She had also worked extensively with HenryKissinger, a highly skilled programmer, and Nelson Rockefeller, the four timesGovernor of New York. Rockefeller became vice-president of the United States whenthe paedophile, Gerald Ford, replaced Richard Nixon after Watergate. Brice claimed tohave been forced to have sex with John F Kennedy when she was or[ly 12, although shesaid: “I was made up to look 16”. Bob Hope is also named by Springmeier and Wheelerin their book as a slave handler and as a British Intelligence operative during theSecond World War as he toured the world hosting concerts for the troops.60 Hope andmedia mogul, Rupert Murdoch, were both awarded ‘knighthoods’ by the RomanCatholic Church in Los Angeles, California. They became Knights of the Order of StGregory and while I was writing this book Hope was given an honorary knighthood bythe Queen to elevate him to the same rank as Bush, Kissinger, and the other chosen fewthe Windsor’s reward for services to the cause. Bob ‘isn’t he a hoot’ Hope has beenused to draw many top names in Hollywood into the net and one of his most famousfilms, The Road To Mandalay, was appropriately named because the most elite group atthe Bohemian Grove is known as the Mandalay Camp. Hollywood and theentertainment industry is rife with both slaves and handlers.Another famous figure named by Springmeier and Wheeler as a Satanist is theworld’s best known ‘Christian’ preacher, Billy Graham.61 Springmeier and Wheeler haveassembled a list of people who have seen Graham ‘in action’. They also say he usesProject Monarch slaves for sex and he launders drug money through his evangelicaloperation. Graham is a Brotherhood stooge who carries messages between worldleaders.62 The witnesses say that Graham is a multiple who switches personalities, andthe ‘person’ people see at the pulpit is only one compartment. There are others which arevery different. ‘Christianity’ is a cover used by countless Satanists and programmers andDr Loreda Fox says in her book, The Spiritual And Clinical Dimensions of MultiplePersonality Disorder, that “Most survivors whom I have worked with had Satanistparents who were high in positions in churches; many were pastors”.63 Christianity wasthe creation of the Brotherhood and is still controlled by it. Billy Graham, a 33rd degreeFreemason, is a close friend of George Bush and Henry Kissinger. He and Bushfamously ‘prayed’ together after Bush had given the go ahead to kill countless men,women and children in the Gulf War. Another friend of Graham, Allan Dulles, was theSatanist Director of the CIA, who helped to fund Hitler. Dulles was one of the mainarchitects after the war of MKUltra and Project Monarch.

Watson, President of the Occidental Petroleum Corporationof the Brotherhood frontman, Armand Hammer (Arm and Hammer). The Billy Grahamtelevision shows put messages on the screen carrying Monarch activation codes,Springmeier and Wheeler say.65 When Billy Graham’s family first went to the UnitedStates they were known as the Frank family and were related to Jakob Frank the leaderof a branch of Satanism called Sabbatuanism, later, due to his leadership, Frankism.66The evidence that Springmeier and Wheeler present to support these claims aboutGraham is simply enormous and covers some 24 pages. A Presidential Model told methat Pope John Paul II is a programmed multiple and that certainly fits the picture.Cathy O’Brien says that she and her daughter, Kelly, escaped from Project Monarchwhen Mark Phillips came on the scene. He says he worked with Alex Houston on a bigbusiness deal involving Hong Kong and China, but then he was told by a representativeof the Chinese Ministry of Defence about Houston’s background and his involvementwith the CIA, drugs, money laundering, child prostitution, and slavery. Phillip’sinformant, who, he says, produced documentary proof, said that Houston was a “verybad man” and that his crimes were “of the White House”. Mark Phillips writes inTrance Formation Of America:“My first response to this ‘officer’ was that Houston was too stupid and crooked to beconnected with US ‘Intelligence’. This comment was quickly countered with a gut-wrenchingphotograph of Houston. He was smiling a demonic grin while apparently having anal sexwith a small, very young, frightened black boy. Later he was identified to me as Haitian.”67Phillips says he made contact with an old friend, now dead, who had been an AirForce general in the Intelligence Division and maintained close connections with theupper levels of US and foreign intelligence. He says the general told him about the CIAslave trade world-wide and that Cathy and Kelly had been subjected to trauma-basedmind control. Mark Phillips recalls:“I was growing numb. The first words out of my dry mouth were: ‘How would you springthese people out of it?’“He smiled and said: ‘I wouldn’t! What are you going to do with them if you get them out?’Before I could answer, he interrupted and said: ‘Look. You’re still the same, but nothingelse is with Uncle (the USA). Now most of the CIA, FBI, and the Mob (Mafia) are the sameand they’re making moves on the military. ’“68Phillips says he was insistent that he wanted to attempt a rescue and he writes thathis friend gave him the mind control codes (based on Christianity and God) that wouldactivate Cathy to go with him. The full and detailed story is told in their book. Phillipssays he took them to Alaska while leaving messages for the authorities that he had no"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"339intention of exposing the truth. He said he told them he would “...take them to Alaskaand play like a voiceless chameleon”. This he hoped would spare their lives at thisstage, he says. Phillips told me that they have also been helped by many good people inIntelligence who want to root out this sickness. There is an internal ‘war’ unfoldingwithin the Intelligence community, it would appear. In Alaska, Mark Phillips says heused his knowledge of mind control, with covert support from his contacts, todeprogram Cathy’s compartmentalised mind. This immense task absorbed almost everyspare waking moment month after month after month, he says. Cathy began toremember what had happened, she says, and what a story she now had to tell. Kelly’sdeprogramming proved even more difficult and she suffered from severe asthma causedby the constant trauma she has suffered. Attempts were made by the CIA mindcontroller, Dr Louis Jolyon West, and his associates, to take Kelly from Cathy andMark. Eventually the authorities used the ‘law’ to ensure they had control of her onceagain. Kelly became a political prisoner under the custody of the State of Tennessee.This is a story constantly repeated. Brice Taylor and Arizona Wilder lost their childrenwhen they broke away. Brice’s daughter is also called Kelly, a common illuminati namefor such children. Her daughter was also sexually abused by Bush. The media andpublic were banned from court cases involving Kelly O’Brien and she was denied theright to an independent attorney, Cathy says. The court also banned the words‘president’, ‘politics’, ‘New World Order’, ‘mind control’ and ‘George Bush’69 All thiswas ‘justified’ by the interests of ‘national security’. These restrictions weresignificantly eased after the publication of their book. The authorities refuse todeprogram Kelly from her Project Monarch-MKUltra mind control by invoking theNational Security Act (amended by Reagan in 1984) which allows them the excuse of‘national security’ whenever they want to put the lid on something. Whenever you seegovernments using the guise of ‘national security’ to deny justice and information, whatthey really mean is the security of their own criminal behaviour. Cathy and Mark saythey have had their life threatened many times, but they have sent their information,with documented and sometimes audio tape support, to a catalogue of US politicians,government agencies, and pressure groups, including presidential candidate andBrotherhood yes man, Bob Dole. The silence has been deafening.Cathy says she witnessed many conversations about the New World Order whichsupport the themes that I and scores of others have written about, including the plansfor a military coup of the United States. As Cathy’s experiences confirm, the attempt tocomplete the takeover of the world is not a theory, it is REAL. It’s happening now.Cathy says that she heard both Reagan and Bush insist that the only way to “worldpeace” is the “mind control of the masses”. She reports that she was able to observe theplanning of the New World Order project, Education 2000, while under the control ofanother of her and Kelly’s programmers and sexual abusers, the reptilian Bill Bennett, aJesuit-trained mind controller, who became US Education Secretary under Reagan-Bush.70 She was then placed under the control of Bill Bennett’s associate LamaAlexander, the former governor of Tennessee, with whom Cathy says she had been"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"340forced to take part in a Satanic ritual in an affluent area of Nashville.71 Bill Bennett’sbrother, Bob, who is also alleged to have raped Kelly at the Bohemian Grove in 1986,later became legal counsel to Bill Clinton.72 Another of Bill Bennett’s roles was to heada ‘war on drugs’ for George Bush! Well at least Bennett could not be accused of a lackof experience in the subject. The Bennetts’ were the ones who took her through one ofher reptilian experiences I described earlier in the book. Cathy says she was used tocompromise and provide ‘favours’ for key politicians to ensure support for Education2000. She learned that this project, also known as America 2000 and Global 2000, isdesigned to increase children’s ‘learning’ capacity while destroying their ability tocritically think for themselves.73 Our children are being mind controlled every day atschool and most of the teachers don’t even know they are doing it, because they havebeen conditioned by the same system. A friend who works in education research in theUnited Kingdom has had access to suppressed surveys which show that children areasking fewer and fewer questions about the ‘facts’ they are told in school -particularlyafter they move to the senior schools.Cathy says she witnessed how the United Nations is just a vehicle for themanipulators. George Bush referred to the New World Order as his ‘neighbourhood’and talked of how he simply told many other world leaders, like King Fahd of SaudiArabia, what to do and say. No doubt the same applies to Saddam Hussein with whomBush shared oil ‘kick backs’ totalling hundreds of millions of dollars (see .. And TheTruth Shall Set You Free). The US Secretary of State (formerly UN ambassador),Madeleine Albright, is a Brotherhood initiate. I call her the High Priestess of USpolitics. George Bush once described her in Cathy’s presence as... “the reverend motherof all sisters (slaves)”74 Albright knows about the US government mind controlledslaves and supports that policy. Yet there she was in front of the television cameras atthe United Nations and as Secretary of State, lecturing other countries on human rights.Cathy recalls that Brian Mulroney, the Canadian Prime Minister and child rapist, talkedabout the plan for the New World Order while with Cathy and Reagan at the sameWhite House cocktail party at which she met Albright. Cathy says she was subsequentlytaken to a White House bedroom with other slaves, including one controlled by the USSenator, Arlen Spector. Mulroney then arrived to rape them after activating their sexslave programming.75 Cathy says she noticed that one of the slaves had a red rosetattooed on her left wrist and other people she met over the years, including Mulroney,wore the symbol of the red rose which indicates membership of the Order of the Rose,an Elite offshoot of the Rosicrucians. Other people connected to the Order of the Roseinclude Clinton, Bush, Byrd, Bennett and Trudeau. How fascinating, then, that theUnited Kingdom Labour Party should change its party symbol in the 1980s to a... redrose.The handlers of slaves like Cathy carry with them a black or grey three-ringnotebook - often these days a laptop computer - which lists the access keys andtriggers.76 Others memorise them.

I wastold by a contact about thousands of caged children kept at the China Lake NavalWeapons Center in the California desert at Ridgecrest. This is in the same region as themass grave for ritually murdered children at Lancaster, California, I mentioned earlier.Vast areas of land in this region between Los Angeles, the infamous San BernandinoValley and Las Vegas, Nevada, are occupied by the United States Forces. It is also oneof the greatest areas of Satanism on the planet. It includes the Edward’s Airforce base,China Lake, and the town of Bakersfield. Springmeier and Wheeler write that otherprogramming sites close to China Lake are Papa Ludo’s Store and Tavern which has asecret underground programming centre, and Scotty’s Castle in the appropriately namedDeath Valley.78 The ‘local’ for the CIA personnel operating at China Lake is theHideaway Tavern. Northwest of the airfield at China Lake the authorities have built ahexagram (Star of David - Seal of Solomon) on the ground, each section of which is aquarter of a mile long.79 These lands run into the deserts of Nevada which are full ofBrotherhood operations in and around their wholly-owned city of Las Vegas. I havedriven through all these areas and it is one of blackest places you will ever experience.Interestingly, the Springmeier-Wheeler research also documents the involvement ofthe China Lake Naval Weapons Center which I had also heard from other sources. Theysay that ‘batches’ of babies numbering one, two and three thousand, were kept at ChinaLake in cages piled to the ceiling of large hangers.80 The cages, known as ‘WoodpeckerGrids’ were electrified and the babies were tortured with powerful electric shocks.81 Amale survivor of Project Monarch tells of seeing the rows and rows of cages at ChinaLake and one of the programmers, he said, was dressed like a catholic priest.82 Hedescribed how the electric current running through the cages made a humming soundand he said that children were sacrificed by people in black hooded robes in front of thechildren in the cages. This took place on a marble slab which served as an altar.83Charles Manson was a slave programmed at China Lake and his cult was based only 45minutes drive away at the Myers and Barker ranches.84 Josef Mengele (Dr Green orGreenbaum) and Ewen Cameron (Dr White) both worked at China Lake after the war. Itwas then called the Naval Ordinance Test Station or NOTS.Survivors of China Lake recall flashing lights. The flashing creates disassociation,particularly with those who are programmed, and this is why the phenomenon offlashing lights was introduced into our culture. Discos and pop concerts are anobvious example. The operation at China Lake is closely connected with theCalifornia Institute of Technology at Pasedena.85 Children are transported to ChinaLake by train, car and air. One of the main delivery routes into China Lake is byplane from the Santa Rosa airstrip near Bohemian Grove. The airstrip was builtduring World War Two as a training base. FEMA, the Federal EmergencyManagement Agency, has a radio station there.86 FEMA is officially the governmentagency which responds to disasters like hurricanes and tornadoes.

This is no theory, video footage exists ofsome of these places. They have railway lines running into them in classic Nazi fashion.The tops of the barbed wire fences, which were formerly designed to keep people out,have now been changed to keep people in. The Santa Rosa strip is supposed to beclosed, yet planes are leaving there every night and they do not put their lights on untilthey are hundreds of feet in the air.87 They land at China Lake early in the morning. Ifyou think the numbers of children claimed to be involved are an exaggeration, the truthis that this is only a fraction of the children in mind control projects and Satanic abuserings in every country in the world. The children come through the breedingprogrammes, through adoption agencies (particularly, it seems, Catholic ones), somefrom kidnapping in the Third World, and from parents who sell their own children.They also come through the network of Social Services agencies. There areorganisations whose job it is to find children of the right genetic background for theseprojects. The best known was the CIA/FBI group called the Finders and programmedchildren are also trained to procure other children. One case which came to light inFebruary 1992 involved an American lawyer called Patrick Gagel, who exported threethousand children from the United States to Peru for ‘adoption’ and they were neverseen or heard of again.88 Gagel was arrested by Peruvian police, but then released afterpressure from ‘on high’89 This is another common theme in which the perpetrators ofsuch abominations can operate outside the law. Don Ecker, the state director in Idahofor the UFO investigation network known as MUFON, wrote the following in the July-August1989 edition of UFO magazine:“According to a recent report just received from Westchester County, New York,researchers have discovered that in a small area of the county, which has been the site ofnumerous UFO overflights and reported human abductions, over 3,000 missing childrenreports have surfaced. After extensive investigation by local police departments, thesechildren have not yet been found at centers for young runaways or in red light districts.Researchers and law enforcement officials are baffled.”90The mind controlled EliteThe Brotherhood scientists realised that the ability to disassociate quickly is passed onfrom generation to generation through genetics. This is why the CIA targeted CathyO’Brien. She was the daughter of parents who had themselves been sexually abused aschildren and therefore the parents ability to disassociate to cope with their childhoodtrauma would have been passed on to their children. This makes the children much moreopen to disassociation via trauma-based mind control. There is no greater example of thisthan the bloodline families themselves. They put their children through staggering traumasand abuse and this multigenerational genetic ‘baton’ has made these families particularlyopen to disassociation by mind control. They apparently put their children through a seriesof tests around the age of 18 months to determine which of them are most open todisassociation. They are then programmed through their childhood to think the way the"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"343Brotherhood wants them to think so they will take the Agenda forward into the nextgeneration. It is the mind controlled manipulating the mind controlled. According to theexperiences of Cisco Wheeler and many of the other victims and therapists involved in thissubject, the child of the Elite families are conceived according to ancient rituals and theirprogramming is agreed and set out largely before they are even born. One of these pre-birth rituals is called the Moon Child ceremony. Mothers who give birth to a so-called‘dark child’ are called a ‘Rosemary’ - the rose of Mary. Roman Polanski, the husband ofSharon Tate, the actress murdered by Charles Manson’s cult, made a film calledRosemary’s Baby. Polanski’s film was about a woman impregnated by a demon summonedby a Satanic cult. Over the centuries it became understood that if you torture a child in thewomb the baby would disassociate or ‘split’ and so mothers are traumatised duringpregnancy to traumatise the child. Needles are inserted into the womb to stab the baby.Many are induced prematurely because of the effect that has on them and it is also part ofthe selection process.A child who shows the instinct and spirit for survival in a premature birth willnormally enlist that same spirit during the trauma-programming which will often takethem to near death. After birth, a programmer is assigned to them. This is normally awoman, although it can be male. The Brotherhood children are often assigned aprogrammer known in the hierarchy as a Grande Dame.91 Children are ‘bonded’ to theprogrammers and taught to become dependent upon them. The idea is to manipulate thechildren to worship the programmer and see them as a god. The child is only allowed todevelop a close relationship with the programmer and that relationship is based onadoration, dependency and obedience. They are taught total obedience to theprogrammer and later to the Agenda and the Brotherhood hierarchy. Once the process ofcrying has developed their lungs, they are taught not to cry through a series ofpunishments and rewards under the system known as behaviour modification. Alreadythey are becoming robots. One foundation technique is to give them intense love andaffection for the first 18 months of their lives and then suddenly withdraw it and treatthem with extreme cruelty. This is a technique known as ‘love bombing’ and when theswitch is made from love to cruelty the trauma this creates in the child is enormous. Theywill also be allowed to bond with a pet and then the pet is killed. The programmer thechild loved so much is now the person the child fears with equal intensity. Springmeierand Cisco Wheeler, herself a victim of government programming, describe what follows:“Everything imaginable can be used to overwhelm the caged little child’s senses andcreate dissociation. Rotten foul odours of the child’s excrement, of ammonia, and rottenfood while it huddles in its cage will overwhelm the child’s sense of smell. Being fed bloodoverwhelms the sense of taste. The chanting of the programmers dressed in Satanic garb,banging noises, rock music, and the electric hum, and ultrasonic stimulation overwhelmsthe child’s sense of hearing. The child’s natural developing sense of shapes is takenadvantage of by spinning the child and making it feel like it is going to fall. The child willalso be deprived of sleep and drugged..."},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"344“...The fourth stage is to strip the child of everything nice and lovely in the world. The childis caged and tormented by electric shock. The child’s senses will be overloaded and theywill become numb. Eyewitnesses have described these hundreds of numbered children as‘zombies’... In the fourth step, the child is starved, cold, and naked. When they finally seetheir beloved master or beloved adult caretaker appear after suffering from 42 to 72 hours,they are excited and they dissociate the pain of the previous hours of deprivation. Helpappears to be on the scene. At that point the programmer/ beloved adult shows her/hismost vicious side, and the child in order to deal with how this loving caretaker has not onlyrejected them, but is now hurting them, dissociates along the same lines of dissociationcreated by the trauma of the premature birth.”92How can the Brotherhood initiates be so inhuman? Because they are reptilians, orrather that group of reptilians on the lower fourth dimension and they do not have theemotions that we feel. This treatment is, in part, to ensure that any consciousness whichincarnates into these bloodlines with the aim of removing their power, will find italmost impossible to manifest its true self. Those chosen for programming are usuallyvery intelligent because people with low intelligence and creativity have been found tobe almost impossible to program to the level required. Springmeier and Wheeler saythat at the age of three the Elite Brotherhood children selected for later advancementinto the hierarchy are taken before the Grand Druid Council and formal approval isgiven at a presentation by the Queen Mother of the Council. Interesting how GeorgeBush told Cathy O’Brien that Madeleine Albright, the US Ambassador to the UnitedNations and Secretary of State, was the ‘Reverend Mother of all slaves’. I stress againthat this Grand Druid Council has nothing whatsoever to do with the many thousands ofpeople who call themselves Druids today and they are not connected with these eventsin any way. We need to understand that the use of a name by the Brotherhood does notmean that everyone using that name is involved. Most of the Druids I have met inBritain are lovely people with love in their hearts and I have no desire to castcondemnation on them. Quite the opposite.The most preferred candidates for programming are fittingly, like Cathy O’Brien,blond-haired and blue-eyed ‘Caucasians’ who are not physically defective in anyway. The Brotherhood bloodlines are not only those which carry the names of theclassic bloodline families. Jhe Brotherhood also use ‘breeders’, women who givebirth to their unofficial children. They use ‘brooder’ families where women bearBrotherhood children, or rear children from the time they are babies, who areconnected to classic bloodline families, although there appears to be no relationship.Children are swapped, sent to foster parents (like Sir Francis Bacon), or motherssuddenly ‘give birth’ when no-one even knew they were pregnant, which, of course,they weren’t. This allows Brotherhood bloodline members to be placed in thepositions of power in politics, banking, business, the media and the military, withoutthere being an outcry from the public that the same families are in all the positions ofcontrol."},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"345Those who are not put through the birth trauma and programmed from the wombhave to begin their ‘preparation’ before the age of six because this type of programmingis more difficult after that. Some are still brought into the programme after that age, butthis is rare. These children are put through even more gruesome torture to break downtheir developing minds. The programmers find out what phobias and fears the childrenhave and use those to terrify them. This includes putting children in dark confinedplaces with spiders and snakes. The children are told that if they ‘play dead’ the snakesand spiders won’t bite them, so encouraging them to dissociate. Putting them in coffinsemphasises that. They are forced to kill and eat other children and they are immersed inexcrement, urine, and blood. Most of the slave children will have experienced all thesethings and more by the age of four or five.93 One common sign of programming orchildhood sexual abuse are eating disorders like bulimia. That is not to say that allbulimia is caused by that, of course not, but it is a regular occurrence in ritually abusedand mind controlled people, as is attempted suicide and self mutilation. Finding itdifficult to hold a stable relationship is another and so is a squint in the left eye. CathyO’Brien says she was tortured by having a needle pushed into her eye. This eye trauma,and sometimes the insertion of a microchip behind the left eye, is quite common. BaronGuy de Rothschild has a drooping left eye. He is a major slave handler andprogrammer, but he would have been put through childhood trauma as part of hispreparation for his role in the Brotherhood. The programmers create monsters and thenthose monsters create the next generation of monsters while the whole thing iscontrolled by the reptilians. The idea is to break the children’s spirit so they will doexactly as they are told without question. That is precisely the aim and the methods ofthe British public school system and its like around the world, a system which, like thedeeper mind-programming projects, are turning out the leaders and administrators whorun the world to the Brotherhood reptilian Agenda.The false memory scamWhen Cathy O’Brien and thousands around the world began to recover their memoriesof abuse, the authorities retaliated with an organisation called the False MemorySyndrome Foundation (FMSF) which has sought to discredit their stories. It began inthe United States in 1992, fronted by Pamela Freyd and her husband, Peter, amathematician at the University of Pennsylvania, who have both been accused by theirdaughter, Jennifer, of abusing her as a child. Branches of the False Memory SyndromeFoundation have appeared in other countries, including the UK, and, as a result, manyjournalists have written deeply destructive articles dismissing the memories of mindcontrol and ritual abuse victims as illusions. The FMSF claim that the victims of abuseare suffering from false memories and are not remembering what really happened. Ofcourse this can happen, but the False Memory Syndrome Foundation is not satisfiedwith ‘some’. It wants all of them to be dismissed in this way, which is utter nonsense. Ithas hounded responsible therapists, accusing them of putting the memories into theirclients minds. Why the therapists would want to do that has not been explained, nor"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"346how those people who have never forgotten their childhood sexual and Satanic abusecould be suffering from a false memory. A FMSF ‘scientific’ adviser, Doctor HaroldMerskey, testified in court that a woman claiming that her doctor sexually abused her asa child might be suffering from false memory syndrome, when the doctor had alreadybeen struck off for previous paedophile activities he had admitted. Merskey had not evenexamined the woman and said his conclusion came from observing her in the court!One of the leaders of the FMSF Doctor Ralph Underwager, was forced out when itwas revealed publicly that he and his wife, Hollida Wakefield, had given an interview toa Dutch paedophile magazine called Paedika in 1993, in which he said that sex withchildren was “An acceptable expression of God’s will for love”. Three members of theAdvisory Board of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation in the United States havebeen Doctor Martin Orne, a notorious CIA mind controller at the University ofPennsylvania; Doctor Louis Jolyon ‘Jolly’ West at the University of California, anotherinfamous CIA mind controller (featured, like Orne, in .. And The Truth Shall Set YouFree); and James Randi, a magician known as The Amazing Randi. Amazing indeed tohear a tape of him, as I have, propositioning teenage boys for sex and boasting about his‘nine inch willy’. Or maybe that tape and the transcript in my file is a false memory.Randi has also been used to discredit psychic powers and phenomena through aludicrous organisation called the Committee for the Investigation of Claims of theParanormal or CSICOP. This is headed by Paul Kurtz, the chairman of PrometheusBooks, which publishes the works of James Randi and books about children’s sexualencounters with adults. Kurtz is Professor emeritus of Philosophy at New York StateUniversity in Buffalo. Another member of CSICOP, Vern Bullough, the Professor at theFaculty of Natural and Social Science at the University of New York, is the ‘HumanSexuality’ Editor at Prometheus Books. He is also a board member of Paedika, theDutch paedophile magazine which interviewed Ralph Underwager of the False MemorySyndrome Foundation. A number of people are board members of both FMSF andCSICOP. What a web we weave. Discrediting psychic phenomena, life after death, orthe memories of childhood ritual abuse, its all the same to these guys. And what do bothorganisations have in common? They serve the Brotherhood Agenda by suppressing theexposure of the mind control and ritual abuse networks and the knowledge of the truenature of life. I am also staggered sometimes by the ‘research’ of some ‘conspiracywriters’ who dismiss the existence of Project Monarch and the highly detailed anddocumented work of people like Springmeier and Wheeler. If you read such authors inthe light of the evidence presented here and elsewhere, one wonders if these‘conspiracy writers’ are merely poor reseachers or part of the agenda to lead peopleaway from the truth. One writer comes to mind immediately who turns out ‘conspiracy’books full of old information with no original research and yet dismisses the detaileddocumentation and personal experience of Springmeier and Wheeler.How easy it has been to keep people in ignorance by destroying the true records ofthe reptilian involvement in human history and by selling a version of life that is aperversion of the truth.

Oh yes they would, and they do,and they are doing it to someone now. The reptilians can continue with the globaldictatorship in all its grotesque forms because most people aren’t bothered what isgoing on in the world and who is controlling their lives and those of their clLildren.They are so pressured by debt and fear that they keep their heads down and their eyesclosed; or they are more concerned at the price of beer, the latest ‘scandal’ on thetelevision soaps, or how their soccer team is doing. Michael Aquino, the Satanist at theUS government’s Psychological Warfare Department, once told Cathy O’Brien: “95 percent want to be led by the other five per cent and the 95 per cent do not want to knowwhat is really going on in government”. How sad that this is actually true. Anyone whostill believes that the outcome of soccer matches or the price of beer is really importantin the wider picture of life on this planet, might benefit from reading the following. It isan account in Cathy’s own words of what happened to her child, Kelly, again and again:“Kelly became violently physically ill after her induction into George Bush’s ‘neighbourhood’and from every sexual encounter she had with him thereafter. She ran 104-6 degreetemperatures, vomited and endured immobilising headaches for an average of three days(as is consistent with high voltage trauma). These were the only tell4ale evidences asidefrom the scaring burns left on her skin. Houston forbade me to call a doctor, and Kellyforbade me to comfort her, pitifully complaining that her head ‘hurt too bad even to move’.And she did not move for hours on end. Kelly often complained of severe kidney pain andher rectum usually bled for a day or two after Bush sexually abused her. My own mindcontrol victimisation rendered me unable to help or protect her. Seeing my child in suchhorrible condition drove my own wedge of insanity in deeper, perpetuating my total inabilityto affect her needs until our rescue by Mark Phillips in 1988.“Kelly’s bleeding rectum was... one of (the)... physical indicators of George Bush’spaedophile perversions. I have overheard him speak blatantly of his sexual abuse of heron many occasions. He used this and threats to her life to ‘pull my strings’ and control me.The psychological ramifications of being raped by a paedophile president are mindshattering enough, but reportedly Bush further reinforced his traumas to Kelly’s mind withsophisticated NASA electronic and drug mind control devices. Bush also instilled the ‘whoya gonna call?’ and ‘I’ll be watching you’ binds on Kelly, further reinforcing her sense ofhelplessness. The systematic tortures and traumas I endured as a child now seem trite incomparison to the brutal physical and psychological devastation that George Bush inflictedon my daughter. “94Come on gang, I know this chapter must have been terribly hard to read, but it’s timeto wake up.

There are also a seriesof Brotherhood ‘signatures’ which form their secret language and these are all aroundus every day. They are obsessed with their rituals and symbols because of their reptilianbrain and I cannot overstress this point. It is a means through which they can be trackedand read.Their most used symbols are the lighted torch, the symbol of knowledge and theSun. When an initiate reaches a certain level in the pyramid they are said to be‘illuminated’, more symbolism of the lighted torch. One of the recurring stories in theancient world is of a hero figure who takes fire (knowledge) from the ‘gods’ and gives itto the people - the chosen few people, that is. The Watchers called Azazel andShemyaza were among those who gave advanced knowledge to humans, according tothe Book of Enoch. The most famous symbol of these Watchers is the Greek god,Prometheus, who was said to have emerged from the Caucasus Mountains. In manyways he was another Jesus’ figure who died for the people and it is not inconceivablethat the story of Jesus was inspired, in part, by the legend of Prometheus. At theRockefeller Center in New York today is a gold statue of Prometheus (gold, the solarmetal of the gods) and he is holding the light, the fire, in line with the legend (seepicture section). To the Rockefellers this is not just a statue, it is a symbol of the wholescam they are involved in. The Statue of Liberty is another Brotherhood symbolhighlighting the lighted torch. The Statue of Liberty is actually the Statue of Liberties -the liberties perpetrated on the American people by the Brotherhood. There she standson her island in New York Harbour holding her torch of ‘freedom’ and Americansbelieve she is the symbol of their liberty in the Land of the Free. Nothing could befurther from the truth. The Statue of Liberty was given to New York by FrenchFreemasons and her mirror image stands on an island in the River Seine in Paris (seepicture section for this and other symbols in this chapter). These statues of liberty arerepresentations of Queen Semiramis and Isis et al, with the rays of the Sun around herhead. The ancients symbolised the Sun in this way. And they are not holding the torchof liberty, but the torch of the illuminated ones, the reptilian-Aryan Elite. The Statue ofLiberty is a Brotherhood symbol which says: “We control this country and we aretelling you so, but you are too stupid to see it!” The torch is the most obviousBrotherhood signature."},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"352When the Brotherhood assassinated President Kennedy in 1963, they put a lightedtorch, the eternal flame which has burned to this day, on his grave in the ArlingtonCemetery After the murder in Dallas the Freemasons erected an obelisk in Dealey Plazaa few yards from the spot where Kennedy was shot. At the top they placed a depictionof the lighted torch. When Diana, Princess of Wales, was murdered in the Pont deL’Alma Tunnel in Paris, the ‘shrine’ to her, where people left flowers, was a large goldsymbol of the very ‘eternal’ flame held by the two Statues of Liberty, which justhappened to be on top of the tunnel where her car crashed into the 13th pillar. Just acoincidence! On the island where she is said to be buried, they have placed yet anotherdepiction of a lighted torch. The Brotherhood are telling us that they killed Kennedyand Diana, but unless you understand their symbolic language, you don’t know. Thelighted torch in the Olympic Games has the same meaning. I have to laugh when I seethe different cities holding their breath to see which of them has been selected to holdthe next Olympics. It was all decided years before, in line with what is most appropriateto the Brotherhood Agenda and its symbolism. You would have thought that thecentenary Olympic Games would have been held in its original home of Greece, butinstead it was given to Atlanta. Why the hell Atlanta, especially when the United Stateshad only recently hosted the games in Los Angeles? One reason for this decision by thesymbol-obsessed Brotherhood was the symbolism of the legendary, Atlanta, thegoddess and huntress, who was said to be such a great athlete that no man could beather. Everyone she defeated in a race had to suffer death and many were killed beforeone managed to trick her into losing a race by dropping golden apples to divert herattention. It was said that she and her bridegroom were turned into lions and pulled thechariot of the Great Mother of the Gods.1 The Olympic Games in Atlanta also allowedmultimillions to be spent on roads and infrastructure in a city rejported to be a majorcentre for the New World Order after the Millennium.Another key Brotherhood symbol is thepyramid or the pyramid with the capstonemissing. The street plan of Dealey Plaza whereKennedy was killed is shaped like a pyramidwith the capstone missing and Dealey actuallymeans ‘Goddess Line’ as in Dea (goddess) andley (ley line). The pyramid with the capstonemissing, or the pyramid and all seeing eye, ismost famously depicted on the reverse of theGreat Seal of the United States and the dollar bill.The all seeing eye is the eye of Horus, Lucifer,Satan, whatever name you want to use, and alsorelates to the so-called ‘third eye’, the chakravortex in the centre of the forehead throughwhich we connect with our psychic sight.According to Egyptian legend, Osiris wasFigure 28: The All Seeing Eye on the dollarbilL Is it reptilian?"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"353murdered by Set and Set was killed byHorus who lost an eye in the process, hencethe Eye of Horus. For me it also symbolisesthe reptilians looking into this world fromthe lower fourth dimension and if you lookat a magnification of the eye in Figure 28you will see that the skin texture evenlooks reptilian. The 33rd degree Freemasonand Black Nobility president, FranklinDelano Roosevelt, had this symbol printedon the dollar bill from 1933. It was asymbol of secret societies in Europe longbefore anyone heard of the United Statesand it is awash with Freemasonic andsecret society symbolism going back to theancient world (see Figure 29). The numberof states in America at the time ofindependence, 13, was no coincidence.Thirteen, the sacred twelve and one, is anancient mystical number as we have seenthroughout this book.On the two sides of the Great Seal you find 13 stars above the head of the eagle. Themotto E Pluribus Unum has 13 letters, as does Annuit Coeptis. The eagle holds 13leaves with 13 berries in its right talon and 13 arrows in the left. There are 72 stones(another mystic number) on the pyramid arranged in 13 rows. The eagle evolved fromthe symbol of the phoenix, the sacred Sun bird of the ancient Egyptians andPhoenicians and the Native American version is the thunderbird. Manly P. Hall says thatthe original seal included the phoenix and it is known that one design for the Great Sealsubmitted by William Barton in 1782 included a phoenix sitting on a nest of flames.2The symbol of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry is the double eagle with a head lookingin both directions - the symbol of Nimrod.This same symbol appears in at least two portraits of George Washington. The eagleis a widely used Brotherhood symbol and it can be found on the coats of arms of manycountries, including Egypt, Libya and Iraq. It was a major symbol for the Nazis inGermany and it appears in the designs of pulpits and lecterns used by the ChristianChurch. Seals like the one used in the Great Seal of the United States can be tracedback to at least 4,000 BC in Egypt, Babylon, Assyria and India. Our old friends, inother words. The first English Royal pendant seal was that of Edward the Confessor,who ruled between 1042 and 1066. This became a model for all future British andAmerican seals.The Latin words above and below the pyramid on the Great Seal/dollar billannounce the arrival of a new secular order. The New World Order is the insider nameFigure 29: The Pyramid and All Seeing Eye, theancient Brotherhood symbol, on the dollar bill andthe reverse of the Great Seal of the United States."},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"354for the Brotherhood Agenda and George Bush used the term profusely when he waspresident. The date written in Latin on the bottom of the pyramid, 1776, is thought,understandably, to relate to the American Declaration of Independence in that year. Butsomething else happened on May 1st (a date beloved by Satanists) in that same year of1776. A very significant strand in the Brotherhood network was officially launchedcalled the Bavarian Illuminati by the German professor, Adam Weishaupt. This wasquite a year for the Brotherhood because also in 1776 the House of Rothschild wasformerly founded and the Brotherhood-controlled economist from Scotland, AdamSmith, published his highly influential work, The Wealth Of Nations. Like I say, datesmatter to these people because they represent energy flows and cycles. Weishaupt usedhis Illuminati to further infiltrate Freemasonry. Weishaupt was trained as a Jesuit, theSociety of Jesus. The founder of the Jesuits, the Spaniard Ignatius Loyola, formed asecret society within this apparently ‘Catholic’ order and the initiates were called theAlumbrados, the ‘enlightened’, the ‘illuminated’. Weishaupt created 13 degrees ofinitiation in his Illuminati (the same as the number of levels on the Great Seal pyramid)and the key personnel were to be found in the top nine degrees.The obelisk and the dome are common sights in the monuments and buildings of theBrotherhood. The obelisk is an ancient phallic symbol of the male energy and solarenergy and the dome represents the female or moon energy. Often they are placedtogether or close to each other. This is the symbolism of the Oval Office (the womb,female) in the White House which looks out on the Washington Monument, the vaststone obelisk (phallic, male). These symbols attract and generate the energy theyrepresent: they are a physical thought form. The obelisk also symbolises the penis of theEgyptian Sun god, Osiris. According to legend, after Osiris had been sliced into piecesby his rival, Set, the Queen Isis found all the pieces except his willy. An obelisk claimedto come from Alexandria in Egypt stands in Central Park, New York, and its twin waserected in the 19th century, during the reign of Queen Victoria, on the former Templarlands alongside the River Thames not far from the Houses of Parliament. It is known asCleopatra’s Needle and originally stood in On (Heliopolis), the Egyptian City of theSun, from at least 1500 BC, before it was moved to Alexandria (see picture section). Asphinx has been placed on either side at its London location. Another Egyptian obeliskwhich was built in Luxor 3,200 years ago now stands in the Place de Concorde in Paris,less than a minute’s drive from the scene of Diana’s crash.On the other side of the crash scene is the Eiffel Tower, another gigantic obelisk indisguise. The Washington Monument in Washington DC is a colossal obelisk. Thedome (from a Greek word meaning Place of the Gods) draws in and harnesses energy,as does the pyramid. So often you find that the great cathedrals are built around amassive dome because their builders and designers understood the power of geometryto focus energy in one spot. The vast golden dome on the ‘Islamic’ shrine on TempleMount in Jerusalem, the dome of St Peter’s at the Vatican in Rome, and the Church ofSanta Maria which dominates the skyline of Florence, are obvious examples of this.Look around the major Brotherhood cities and you will find they have at least one"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"355major domed building. In the City of London you have St Paul’s Cathedral designed bythe initiate Sir Christopher Wren after the Great Fire of London had destroyed theoriginal city. The mirror of St Paul’s Cathedral is in Paris and known as the Pantheon.Look at the Congress building in Washington DC and you will find that it is another StPaul’s (see picture section). In London’s Leicester Square there is a dome-shapedskylight with concentric circles in the strangely named Notre-Dame de France built in1865 on a site with Knights Templar associations and rebuilt in the late 1950s.3 Thebuilding includes a stone slab from Chartres Cathedral and a mural of the crucifixionscene, full of occult symbolism and sacred geometry, by the French artist Jean Cocteau(1889-1963), a Grand Master of the Priory of Sion. His mural includes a black sun, aclassic Brotherhood symbol, casting its rays into the sky, and a man with an eye drawnin the shape of a fish, which could well be symbolic of the Babylonian Nimrod. InRome there is the dome at the Vatican, that ancient site of Mithra (Sun) worship, andalongside the dome you find obelisks in St. Peter’s Square. In London, as I write, theMillennium Dome is being built next to the Greenwich zero longitude time-line whichruns through the nearby Greenwich Observatory, which was also, incidentally, designedby Sir Christopher Wren. It is to this point in the world that all the watches, clocks, andtime zones (therefore the collective human mind) are tuned and we view the universefrom the same time-perspective. The measurement used in the Greenwich time-grid issolar time. On the other side of the River Thames, opposite the Millennium Dome, isthe biggest building and obelisk in Europe, the Canary Wharf building. Again in theBrotherhood cities you will invariably find a skyscraper shaped like an obelisk becauseof the effect that has on the energy field and the harnessing of solar energy. Big Ben, thefamous clock at the Houses of Parliament in Westminister is also an obelisk. The wordben is Cymric and Gaelic for mountain and in ancient Egypt ‘Ben’ related to the sacredben ben stone on the top of the pillars in On, the city of the Sun. These pillars becamesymbolised by the obelisk and it was said to be the point where the gods descended tothe Earth. The bennu bird - the inspiration for the Phoenix - sat on the ben ben stone,according to legend.4 There is also another significance for the Millennium Dome andCanary Wharf which I will explain later.The street plans of major cities are designed under the laws of sacred geometry inthe same way that the great cathedrals, temples and stone circles were. As with the Cityof London after the Great Fire of 1666, the new city of Washington DC was designedaccording to these laws. Symbols, shapes and angles generate different energies and ifyou understand these principles you can vibrate the energy field of a place to thevibrational range you deem most suitable for what you wish to achieve there. Anyoneliving or working within that field will be affected by it. You can also focus solar andother astrological energies in that place.I found Washington one of the most unpleasant energies I have ever encounteredoutside the Square Mile in the City of London. A French Freemason, Major PierreCharles UEnfant, was engaged to create the new Washington, and his work was basedon plans officially prepared by leaders like Thomas Jefferson and George Washington,"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"356although others with greater esoteric understanding would have been the real architects.Jefferson, however, had deep esoteric connections and when he died a code systemwhich was very similar to ancient Rosicrucian secret manuscripts was found among hispossessions by the Rosicrucian, Spencer Lewis.5 Some researchers say Jefferson was aGrand Master of the Rosicrucians. He was an expert in astronomy and astrology, as wasBenjamin Franklin who wrote a best-seller on the subject called Poor Richard’sAlmanac. L’Enfant had fought in the War of Independence and he, like Washington,was a member of the highly secretive and exclusive grouping called the Society ofCincinnati. It was officially a secret society for American and French officers in the Warof Independence and it introduced hereditary membership which is passed on to theeldest son. Washington was its president for life. The diary entries of Washington andletters by Jefferson relating to L’Enfant and the street plan have ‘disappeared’. L’Enfantwas dismissed after a year, but the street plan continued. In 1909 his remains wereexhumed and taken by military escort to Capitol Hill to lie ‘in State’ for just three hours.Thousands went to pay their respects and he was reburied at the Arlington NationalCemetery. What goes on? The Arlington Cemetery was formerly the grounds of VernonHouse the home of George Washington and the American Order of the Knights Templarhold their annual sunrise ceremonies in the amphitheatre there.6Forty boundary posts were established a mile apart to mark the boundary of the tensquare miles of Washington and in the centre was built the Congress building, CapitolHill, named after the sacred place of the Roman secret societies called Capitoline Hill.It was no surprise, therefore, that the United States Secretary of State, MadeleineAlbright, the high priestess of American politics, should make a pilgrimage toCapitoline Hill on her first official visit to Europe after her appointment. Capitol Hill isnot a political building, it is a temple to the Satanic Brotherhood and underneath its ‘StPaul’s’ dome is a crypt room. Beneath the floor of the crypt, marked by a pentagramstar, is a vacant tomb. They say this was meant for George Washington, who decided tobe buried elsewhere, but there is more to it than that. The bodies of Kennedy, Lincoln,McKinley, Garfield, Harding, Taft, Hoover, Wilson, Stevens, Dewey, Pershing,MacArthur, UEnfant and two unknown soldiers have all been placed on the catafalquefound in the tomb.7 A catafalque for those, like me, who had never heard the word, isthe structure on which the body is carried during a funeral procession or placed on forlying in state. The same format of a tomb under a dome is the ‘tomb of St Peter’ beneaththe Basilica at the Vatican. The Congress building is a temple to a secret society which,under many names, originates in the ancient world. Within the Washington street plan,centred on Capitol Hill and the White House, are astrological symbols (which relateexactly to where certain constellations appear in the sky), hexagrams, Satanicpentagrams, squares, a Masonic compass, a ‘Spear of Destiny’, a skull and bones andscores of others. For more information and illustrations I strongly recommend anexcellent book by Charles L. Westbrook Jr called The Talisman Of The United States,Signature Of The Invisible Brotherhood. Roads in Washington relate to the points wherethe Sun rises at the winter and summer solstice, just as the ancient mounds, temples and"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"357stone circles like Stonehenge, were designed to do (see Figure 30). Other streets crossat precisely 33 degrees and still others mark the precession of the equinoxes, and thereis a hexagram or Star of David (see Figure 31).I described earlier how the Elite of America and further afield gather at theBohemian Grove in Northern California and take part in ceremonies under a 40 footstone owl. The owl is symbolic of Moloch or Molech, the ancient deity to whichchildren were, and are, sacrificed. The Sumerian goddess, Lilith, known as the Lady ofthe Breasts, was also symbolised as an owl.8 Lilith is symbolic of the bloodline. ThePagan religions knew her as the enchantress. In the picture section you will see the‘grovers’ performing a ceremony at Bohemian Grove before the giant owl. Howinteresting that when I was looking at a map of Washington I found that the roadswithin the grounds of the Congress Building make the very clear symbol of... an owl!You also find that the owl is sitting on a pyramid. The pyramid and all seeing owl (seeFigure 32 overleaf). The collective word for owls is a parliament of owls, which isuncannily appropriate. The same owl symbol can be found hidden on the dollar bill ifyou know where to look and you have a very powerful magnifying glass. I alsounderstand a new pedestrianisation scheme around Nelson’s Column in TrafalgarSquare, London, is going to look like an owl from above. There are at least threeSatanic pentagrams in the Washington street plan. By ‘Satanic’, I mean pentagramspointing downwards or with the lines made of different lengths to distort the shape.These reverses and distortions of the pentagram are Satanic signatures in the same wayFigure 30: The street plan of WashingtonDC, like all the major Brotherhood cities,is a mass of esoteric symbolism.

One pentagrampoints down into Capitol Hill(see Figure 33), another intothe White House (see Figure34), and a third extends outfrom the giant obelisk calledthe Washington Monumentand covers a large area of theinner city. At its centre is thesign for Aries, the ram or lamb.Similar Satanic pentagramscan be identified in the streetplan of Rome, the old city ofJerusalem, the land aroundRennes-le-Chateau, thepyramid site at Giza, and nodoubt over London and othercities and sites. Across thePotomac River fromWashington is the home of theUnited States military - thePentagon Building which wasaligned to the constellation ofTaurus.9 A pentagon, of course,is the centre of a pentagram. Ifyou drive through the centre ofthe White House pentagramyou come to a remarkablebuilding at 1733 16th Street.Note the number: 1733. Thenumber 17 recurs over andover in the story of Rennes-le-Chateau, and 33 is the official number of degrees in the Scottish Rite. This building hasthe feel of an Egyptian temple with two depictions of the Sphinx outside and a massiveimage of the rising Sun. A similar symbol was on the ‘sun chair’ of George Washington.This strange building is the Supreme Headquarters of the 33rd degree of the ScottishRite of Freemasonry. The 33rd degree is known as the Revolutionary Degree and mostheads of government are 33rd degree Freemasons even though they will be keen todeny this or keep it quiet. It is an honorary degree and they will have made an oath ofloyalty to Freemasonry that overrides their oath to their nation.

This building is home to the biggestcollection of Freemason relics in the world (and that’s only the members).In the Smithsonian Museum, just down from the White House, there is a remarkablemarble statue of George Washington which was once displayed at Capitol Hill. It wascommissioned by Congress in the 19th century and sculptured in Florence, Italy, byHoratio Greenough. When the statue was unloaded at the Washington Navy Yard in1840, people were horrified at what they saw. Washington was depicted sitting in achair, naked to the waist, with a sheet laid across his nether regions. General HenryWise, the Virginia statesman, remarked that: “The man does not live, and never did live,who saw Washington without his shirt”10 So why portray him like that? And why washis right hand pointing up and his left hand pointing down? If you look again at Figure21 (page 152) you will understand. They made the statue in the image of Baphomet ofMendes or Asmodeus, theSatanists’ symbol of the‘Devil’. Asmodeus is said tohave been the guardian ofSolomon’s Treasure and aportrayal of him was foundamong the possessions of AbbeSauniere, the mysterious priestat Rennes-le-Chateau whoplaced a statue of Asmodeus atthe entrance to his church.Asmodeus is named as thechief demon in the HebrewTalmud.

The Jefferson and Lincolnmemorials were added to the Washington street plan in the early 20th century. TheJefferson building, historians believe, is based on a design of the Pantheon in Rome.Like all of these key buildings, they are built alongside water or ‘reflecting pools’. Thebuilding represents the Sun and the water is the Moon reflecting the Sun. TheWashington monument, at 555 feet, the biggest stone obelisk in the world, wascompleted in 1885. The cornerstone had been laid by the Grand Freemasons Lodge ofthe District of Columbia. While travelling and speaking in the United States I saw atelevision item which said the authorities intended to build a memorial in the Mall, theheart of the street plan, to those who died in the Second World War. It would include atits centre, they said, a depiction of a lighted torch. The locations of the cities andcentres of the Brotherhood relate to places where solar and other cosmic energy can bemost powerfully harnessed. Charles L. Westbrook Jr, the author of The Talisman OfThe United States, received some anonymous correspondence after his book waspublished. It consisted of a map of the USA and a piece of paper on which were writtenthe words: “It’s bigger than you think.”12 Lines drawn on the map revealed similargeometry to that in Washington, but on a much larger scale. Some of the pointsconnecting the geometry, or highlighted by it, were Mount Vernon, Illinois, whereGeorge Washington is buried; Miami, which was dubbed the ‘magic city’ as early as1820; and a place called Pike’s Peak in Jefferson County, Colorado, just across theborder from Arkansas. Pike’s Peak, of course, is named after Albert Pike.The ancient symbol of the circle and the cross I described a few chapters back, isstill used today in the secret language. It is the one symbolising the Sun’s progressthrough the 12 months and the 12 signs of the zodiac, the cross and circle with the Sunon the cross (see Figure 35). This has inspired the Celtic cross (see Figure 36), thelogo of NATO, the world-army-in-waiting (see Figure 37), and the emblem of the CIA(see Figure 38). In the City of London financial district opposite St Paul’s Cathedral, Ialso found the symbol in Figure 39. It is a zodiac circle with a black sun at the centre.This building was designed originally for the Financial Times newspaper and the faceon the black sun is that of Winston Churchill. The black sun is more reverse symbolismwhich indicates the negative use of solar energy and the galactic sun around which thesolar system orbits. The Nazis also spoke of the black sun.

The white horse was aPhoenician Sun symbol. This same symbol of the circle and the cross was used by thePhoenicians and can be seen in their depictions of their goddess Barati, as it can on theshield in her British version, Britannia. The street plan of Paris, dominated by the Arc or‘arch’ de Triomphe, is the same symbolism. The arch itself is a Brotherhood symbol. Itis the meaning behind the name of the Royal Arch lodges in the York Rite ofFreemasonry and relates in part to the key stone at the top which holds the arch togetherand gives it strength. The earliest record of such a lodge is in the annals of the city ofFredericksburg, Virginia, on December 22nd 1753. Fredericksburg was the location ofthe House of the Rising Sun, the Masonic meeting place where people like BenjaminFranklin, George Washington and other Founding Fathers used to gather. The archsymbolism of Freemasonry is also the inspiration for a vast concrete arch at St Louis,Missouri. The Arc de Triomphe is placed at the centre of a circle from which 12 roadsgo out across Paris. On the road circle around the Arc de Triomphe are 12 points on theroad making a 12-pointed star. Again the sun at the centre of the circle broken up into12 segments (see picture section). The main road going through this pattern is thefamous Champs Elysees and when you follow this line you can see how planned it allis. When you stand underneath the Arc de Triomphe next to the ‘eternal flame’ of theunknown soldier, look in one direction, dead straight, and you see a big modernconcrete arch in the distance. When you turn and look the other way, again deadstraight, you look down the Champs Elysees to the 3,200 year old Egyptian obelisk inthe Place de Concorde. Beyond that in the same direct line you find another arch,similar to the Arc de Triomphe, but much smaller, and that, in turn, is in direct line withthe big black glass pyramidbuilt outside the LouvreMuseum during the presidencyof the 33rd degree Freemason,Francois Mitterrand. Peoplewere flabbergasted that anyonecould build such an out-of-keeping structure alongsidethe beautiful architecture of theLouvre. The reason hadnothing to do with architectureand everything to do withadding more power to thegeometrical design of the city.A similar and vast blackpyramid has been built with amassive Sphinx and an obeliskin that Brotherhood city, LasVegas.Figure 39: The sun and zodiac circle at the entrance to a financialbuilding in the city of London, near St Paul’s Cathedral in the heart ofthe Brotherhood Spider’s Web.

While the dove meanspeace to most people, it symbolises death and destruction to the Brotherhood. Thisreversing allows them to use their symbols in the public eye in a way that no-oneunderstands. Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Provisional IRA in Northern Ireland,has a dove as its symbol for this reason. It is this dove symbolism which gives us thefictitious name of Christopher Columbus who in fact used to sign his name Colon. Thename Columbus was invented as yet more Brotherhood symbolism. The Romans usedto worship a deity they called Venus Columba, Venus the Dove. Venus and dove areassociated with Queen Semiramis in Babylon. The word dove in French today is stillColombre. Columba is also an ‘Aphrodite’ goddess which symbolises the negative,death and destruction, aspects of the female energy. Hence we have British Columbia,Columbia Pictures, Columbia University, Columbia Broadcasting (CBS), the SpaceShuttle Columbia, and District of Columbia in which they placed Washington DC.You’ve only got to look at some of the names for places around Washington to seewhere their originators were coming from. The most obvious is Alexandria just over theborder from the District of Columbia, in Virginia (the virgin - Isis, Semiramis). And, bythe way, look at the logos of those Columbia organisations.

The Maltese or splayedcross (see Figure 40) was found in caves in the former Phoenician lands of Cappadocia,now Turkey, dating back many thousands of years and it became the cross of theKnights Hospitaller of St John of Jerusalem (Knights of Malta), the Knights Templar,and the Nazis. If you look in the picture section at the Nazi soldier you will see that hehas the whole set - the Maltese Cross, the reversed swastika, the skull and bones and theeagle!

Just a coincidence, nothing to worry about.The laurel leaves in the United Nations symbol are mirrored by the Freemasons (seeFigure 41) and there are 33 sections in the circle. The logo is blue, a Freemasoniccolour, as in the Blue Degrees of Freemasonry. The symbol of the European Union isalso blue. The inspiration for the ‘frame’ around the UN logo can be easily seen in theFreemasons symbol in Figure 42. You find the black and white squares of theFreemasons and the Templars (and endless otherBrotherhood groups) on the uniform of British andAmerican police forces (and many others), as well ason the floors of great cathedrals and the church atRennes-le-Chateau. When American presidents puttheir hand on their breast while listening to thenational anthem they are performing part ofFreemasonic ritual. Americans who oppose theFreemasons do the same because they don’tunderstand the symbolism. Another hand signal forthe Brotherhood is to put your arm in the air with thetwo outer fingers pointing upwards and the twomiddle fingers held down by the thumb. This is thesymbol of the Devil or Baphomet, the horns ofNimrod, and this is the sign that Bill Clinton madeafter his first inaugural speech as president inJanuary, 1993. Baphomet is also symbolic of theWatcher-reptilian, Azazel, the ‘goat’. The doublesquare, one square on top of another in any form, ismore secret society symbolism. In the secretlanguage, one square by itself means control of whatis right and just. From this we get phrases like “fairand square” and a “square deal”. One square on topof another means control of all that is right and allthat is wrong, all that is just and all that is unjust, allthat is positive and all that is negative. In other words“we control everything”. The double square, or eightpointed star, can be seen in the lobby at the heart ofthe British Parliament and a long list of world policeforces surround their badge with the same symbol(see Figure 43). The chevron is another version ofthis (see Figure 44). You need to look at this asFigure 43: One square placed overanother in any form means “we controleverything”.

The mostobvious symbol of theBrotherhood’s intent is the fasces,from which we get the word,fascism. You can see it at thebottom of a United States‘liberty’ symbol and in theCongress Building (see Figure50). It was a symbol used widelyin the Roman Empire and itconsists of rods bound togetheraround an axe. This axe is theorigin of the term Axis Powersfor the fascist countries in theSecond World War. Thesymbolism is of people andcountries bound together under acommon centralised dictatorship, the axe. That is a perfect description of the EuropeanUnion in which the nations of Europe are subordinate to common laws decided andimposed by the unelected dictatorship in Brussels. The European Union is truly a fasciststate in accordance with the fascist symbol.Another form of symbolism is known as reverse speech or word inversion. A greatdeal more research is being done into this today and it is one of the mysteries held bythe Brotherhood since ancient time. Under this system, for instance, the car hirecompany, Avis, becomes Siva, one of the gods in the Hindu triad or trinity. The symbolof Siva is the penis and, like Neptune and Satan, Siva is usually pictured with atrident.13 Avis, which is owned by the Brotherhood’s International Telephone andTelegraph, have formerly registered the words ‘Wizard’ and ‘Golden File’ astrademarks, as in ‘The Wizard of Avis’. Sun and sex rite symbolism is constantly usedin advertising by the Brotherhood corporations. These words and symbols communicatewith the human subconscious and affect people without them being aware of it.But symbolism does not have to be negative. It is simply a form of communicationand it has also been used to keep the knowledge alive by those who have a positiveintent for humanity. Knowledge is neutral; it is the use of it that is positive or negative.Tarot cards, the forerunner to our playing cards, were used to pass on suppressedknowledge. Hence the reason why the church has so condemned the tarot cards anddubbed them evil. In the centuries which followed the elimination of the Cathars inFrance, the Tarot was circulated by travelling entertainers and gypsies. SomeFigure 50: Liberty? Then why the fascist symbols at the bottomwhich stand for anything but freedom."},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"366researchers say the Tarot cards were introduced to Europe by the returning crusaderswho had acquired them from mystical sects in the Middle East and that is certainly trueto an extent. But what is often forgotten is the role played by the gypsies and why theyhave been persecuted so often, not least by Adolf Hitler. There is the legend, I believebased on truth, that priests from Alexandria saved whatever they could when the greatesoteric library at Alexandria was burned by the Roman Church and they becamewanderers, a people apart, with their own language and they symbolised their knowledgein the Tarot. When gypsies are first mentioned in English records at the time of HenryVIII, they are described as ‘outlandish people, calling themselves Egyptians’14 The term,Tarot, is believed to be derived from two Egyptian words, Tar meaning road, and Romeaning royal.15 The royal road to wisdom if the knowledge is used properly and notmalevolently. The Tarot consists of the Minor Arcana, four suits called swords (blade),cups (chalice), pentacles and sceptres, and the Major Arcana or ‘Great Secrets’, knownas trumps. Among the trumps was the ‘Joker’ which has survived in modern playingcards. The Joker is the jester who used humour and clowning to pass on the message.The Joker also connects to the Trickster, a term you find in native American myth.Today’s playing cards are an abridged form of the Tarot. The colours black and redrepresent the two great divisions of the year, Winter and Summer, when the Sun is in thenorth or south. The four suits are the seasons. The 13 cards in each suit are the 13 lunarmonths of the year and the 52 cards in the deck are the 52 weeks of the year. If you countthe joker as one point and the Jack, Queen, King, as 11,12 and 13, the sum value of the52 cards is 365, the days of the year. There is astrological symbolism in there, too. Thehighly symbolic game of chess, the ‘royal game’, was played in China and India longbefore it arrived in Europe. A form of chess, more like draughts, was played by thePharaohs in Egypt. The chess board consists of 64 black and white squares, symbolisingthe floor of the House of Mysteries. The black and white chess ‘teams’ symbolise theeternal battle between negative and positive, light and dark, among much else. The 64squares on a chess board relate to the Chinese esoteric system known as the I Ching,which consists of 64 hexagrams. It is all the same knowledge hidden or presented indifferent ways. The singers and song writers known as the Troubadours of 12th and 13thcentury France sang the praises of their ‘lady’. The name troubadour itself leads us backto North Africa because it comes from the Arab term ‘tarab dour’, meaning House ofDelight, a remnant of the Muslim occupation of southern France. They hid their ‘lady’behind the biblical Mary in order to stay alive, but the true meaning of their ‘lady’ wasIsis. Later would come the stories of King Arthur and his search for the Holy Grail,stories that would clearly echo the themes of the Gospels, Mithra, Horus, etc., in theirsymbolism of the Sun, Isis and the astrological Round Table.There you have just some of the symbolism which non-initiates, or those who havenot taken the trouble to find out, simply cannot see.

They are of a Black Nobility bloodline who are knowingly working to theBrotherhood Agenda and when you look behind the facade what you find is very darkindeed. The Windsors are the highest profile reptilian family on the planet and theyoperate at the heart of the global manipulation. They are still ‘gofers’ of a kind and notat the very top of the pyramid, but they are close to those who are.The very coronation of the British monarch reveals the true background to theWindsors and their predecessors. When the Queen was crowned Elizabeth II on June2nd 1953, all the regalia of the ceremony, the crowns, sceptres, gowns, orb andbracelets, were taken from the Tower of London and kept overnight in the JerusalemChamber at Westminster Abbey. This chamber is where the scholars met to translate theKing James ‘authorised version’ of the Bible under the overall supervision of SirFrancis Bacon and Robert Fludd, the Grand Master of the Priory of Sion.1 The BritishRoyal family still hold the copyright for this! The Jerusalem Chamber is panelled withcedar wood brought from the Lebanon because that was the wood said to be used tobuild Solomon’s Temple. The tapestry in the chamber depicts the Judgement ofSolomon. Westminster Abbey, the ‘Christian cathedral’, is in fact a Pagan temple. Eventhe floor is made of black and white squares like a Freemasonic temple.At the start of the ceremony in 1953, the Queen sat on the Coronation Chair andunder her bum was the Stone of Destiny which Edward I had stolen from Scone(pronounced ‘scoon’) Abbey in Scotland in 1246. The Stone was supposed to have beenbrought to Ireland from Israel via Egypt and is also known as Jacob’s Pillar or Pillow. Ithink the basic theme of that is correct, but there is a great deal more to know about thedetail and its true significance. The Archbishop of Canterbury turned to the north,south, east, and west (the four points of the Pagan cross) and the congregation shouted“God save the Queen”. This was symbolic of the story in the Old Testament describingthe crowning of ‘Saul’ as King of Israel when people shouted “God save the King”.2This cry can be found eight times in the Old Testament when the Kings of Israel arecrowned. The Queen sat in the Coronation Chair holding the Egyptian symbols, asceptre and a rod. On the top of the sceptre is the Maltese Cross and on the rod is a"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"369dove. She also later holds an orb with a Maltese Cross on the top, the same as thoseused by the Dutch wing of the Black Nobility. Babylon is now London and QueenElizabeth is seen by the Brotherhood as a symbolic successor to the legendary founderof Babylon, Queen Semiramis, who was symbolised as a ‘dove’. The Queen was alsoanointed with oil at her Coronation, the ancient Aryan and reptile-Aryan tradition whichgoes back thousands of years. The word ‘Christ’ means the ‘anointed one’. The oil atthe Queen’s coronation was the same mixture as that used in the ancient Middle East. Itwas carried in a gold vessel called the Ampulla made in the form of... a dove.3 This issymbolic of the messeh fat used in Egypt by the Royal Court of the Dragon. Theanointing at the Coronation is supposed to elevate the monarch to the rank of HighPriest, in this case, appropriately, High Priestess of the Church of England as well ashead of state. While this was happening, the Archbishop of Canterbury said:“As kings, priests, and prophets were anointed: and as Solomon was anointed by Zadokthe priest and Nathan the prophet, so be thou anointed, blessed and consecrated Queenover the peoples, whom the Lord thy God hath given thee to rule andgovern...This is pure Brotherhood symbolism. The ‘Lord thy God’ means the ‘gods’ of theancient world, the reptilian ‘gods’. The crown used in the ceremony goes back to thetime of Edward the Confessor. He was the King of England who built the originalWestminster Abbey in 1065 and later the present one was begun by the Templar-controlled, Henry III. Edward died in 1066, the very year that William the Conquerorand his St Clair supporters invaded England and won the Battle of Hastings underinstructions from the Black Nobility of Venice. The Coronation Crown is set with 12jewels along with two depictions of the Maltese Cross which was one of the mostprominent symbols of the Nazis. In the Levite-authored Exodus we hear of theBreastplate of Aaron which is set with 12 stones.5 The same stones, in the same order,appear in the British crown.6 The Archbishop placed his hands between the Queen’sto pay homage to the new head of his Church and he kissed her right hand. Then hesaid:“The Lord Almighty... establish your throne in righteousness, that it may stand forevermore, like as the sun before him, and as a faithful witness in Heaven.”7This is almost a repeat of the words used in God’s covenant with David in the OldTestament.8 The ‘Lord Almighty’ was formerly El Shaddai or Ishkur, the son of Marduk,who is claimed to have been the son of the Anunnaki scientist, Enki, the guy who,according to the Sumerian Texts as translated by Zecharia Sitchin, was the one whocreated the human-Anunnaki hybrids with Ninkharsag. The Windsors are of aBrotherhood-Black Nobility bloodline and the Queen was crowned in a Brotherhoodceremony inside a Brotherhood temple. This will make sense of what you are about toread."},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"370The Windsor bloodElizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor, or Queen Elizabeth II, is, like all the royal familiesof Europe, is the bloodline of that pivotal figure in the takeover of Britain, William III,Prince of Orange, the man who signed into existence the Bank of England. She is alsoblood related to earlier Black Nobility invaders of the British Isles, like William theConqueror. She is an ancestor of Robert the Bruce, Kenneth MacAlpin, and the Kingsof Scotland, and is related to the Irish Kings going back to the ancient coronationceremonies at Tara. The Queen Mother, formerly Lady Elizabeth (El-lizard-birth)Bowes-Lyon, comes from a seriously Brotherhood-reptilian bloodline, a Scottisharistocratic family which connects with the Bruces, Stuarts, MacAlpin, and downthrough the Kings of Ireland.Her father was Claude George Bowes-Lyon, the 14th Earl of Strathmore, and hermother was Nina Celia Cavendish-Bentinck. The wealth and power of many of theselines owes much, sometimes all, to William of Orange and those who controlled him. Itwas William who made a Bentinck the first Earl of Portland in recognition of servicesrendered and the second Bentinck/Duke of Portland married into the Cavendish fortuneto become the Cavendish-Bentinks, the line of the Queen Mother’s mother. This makesthe Windsors blood relatives of the Cavendish family, the Dukes of Devonshire ofChatsworth House. The title Earl of Strathmore was given originally to the QueenMother’s ancestor, Patrick Lyon, in recognition of his support for William of Orange.9In short, the ancestors of the Windsors were fundamental in putting the Black Nobility’sWilliam of Orange on the British throne after which the Bank of England and the powerof the City of London was firmly established. Queen Elizabeth (El-lizard-birth),through her Hanoverian ancestors, and others, carries the bloodline of the BlackNobility in Germany and all these strands, be they Irish, Scottish, German, Danish,Swedish, whatever, go back via the Black Nobility Venetians through to thePhoenicians, the Egyptians, to Sumer, and the reptilians. The bloodlines are incredibleand Prince Charles can trace three thousand lines of decent alone from Edward III(1312-1377),10 the monarch who formed the Brotherhood grouping the Order of theGarter. Nineteen presidents of the United States have also been related to Edward III11and therefore the line of Prince Charles. The Windsors even have a blood connection tothat Brotherhood stooge, Mohammed, the official founder of Islam.12William of Orange, William III, died in 1702. He and his wife, Mary, left no heirs andso Mary’s sister, Anne, became queen. Anne was the last of the Stuart monarchs becausealthough she had 17 children by her husband, George of Denmark, she survived them all.In 1714 the scene was set for the takeover of the British Crown by the German BlackNobility family, the Hanovers. They were closely connected with the House of Hessewhich would become the launch pad for the House of Rothschild. The first Hanoverianking was George I. He couldn’t even speak English and refused to learn. He began life asminor German nobility, a great grandson of the infamous James I, and ended it as King ofGreat Britain. This guy kept his wife, Sophia, in jail for 32 years for her alleged adulterywith the Swede, Philip von Konigsmark, who was never seen again and was rumoured to"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"371be under the floorboards of George’s Hanover Palace. George II became king in 1727and died in 1760 while sitting on the toilet suffering from acute constipation. Yes hedied of the shits - or rather the lack of them - and there can’t be many monarchs you cansay have literally died on the throne. His grandson became George III, whose reignspanned the American War of Independence and a massive expansion of British power.George IV and William IV followed before we come to Queen Victoria, who reigned asQueen of Britain and Queen-Empress of the Empire from 1837 to 1901. By this timethe British (reptilian) Empire controlled 40 per cent of the Earth’s land mass and morethan a fifth of the population. It was the biggest empire the world had ever seen.Victoria married Prince Albert of the German Black Nobility House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha and had nine children who married into the other royal families (family) ofEurope. Victoria has an image of being very straight-laced, but like the Rothschilds,Winston Churchill, and other apparent pillars of the establishment, she was a frequentuser of cocaine and heroin.’3 Drug parties were held at the royal summer residence atBalmoral in Scotland.14 The first son of Victoria and Albert became Edward VII, aGrand Master of English Freemasonry, who reigned until 1910. It was now, during theFirst World War, that the name of the royal house was changed from the German Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to the House of Windsor. The German name, Battenberg, was alsochanged at the same time, 1917, to the anglicised, Mountbatten. The only reason forthis sudden switch was public relations. The Germans and the British were slaughteringeach other in the trenches of northern France at the time. In 1936 came Edward VIIIwho abdicated to marry an American divorcee, Wallis Simpson, and he was replaced byGeorge VI, the father of Queen Elizabeth, and husband to Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, thepresent Queen Mother. George died in 1952 and his eldest daughter was crownedQueen Elizabeth II at Westminster Abbey in 1953. By then she had married a fellowmember of the Black Nobility, Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, Baron Greenwich,Earl of Merioneth, Duke of Edinburgh. He was born in Corfu, the son of Prince Andrewof Greece and Princess Alice of Battenberg, the great granddaughter of Queen Victoria.Philip, a Battenberg, took the anglicised version of Mountbatten and, after his marriageto Elizabeth, the British Royal house became the House of Windsor-Mountbatten. Orrather it was Saxe-Coburg-Gotha-Battenberg. This arranged marriage was orchestratedby Lord Louis ‘Dickie’ Mountbatten, Prince Philip’s uncle. Philip is extremely wellrepresented by Black Nobility (reptilian) genes, one reason why he has found itsoirritating to have to walk behind his wife according to royal protocol. The Queen is thegreat granddaughter of Queen Victoria and Philip is also related to Victoria through hismother. One thing to remember is that the royal ‘families’ of Europe are not families atall, they are one family, offshoots of the same bloodline operating to the same Agenda.Some will do this more enthusiastically than others, of course, but basically that’s howit works. An example of this is the way Prince Philip’s clan became the royal family ofGreece. After British Intelligence had organised a coup against the ‘Greek’ King, Otto I(a German!), and removed him from the Greek throne in 1862, they selected PrinceWilliam, the nephew of the Danish king, to become King of Greece. I know all this"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"372sounds ludicrous, but to the Black Nobility this is like a multinational company fillingits executive vacancies. Prince William of the Danes became King George I of Greece.(No, you didn’t misread that.) William, sorry George, er, er, yes George, married agranddaughter of the Russian Tsar Nicholas I and Prince Philip is related to seven Tsars.He has massive bloodline connections into Germany and also Norway, Denmark,Sweden, and to most of the royal lines of Europe. One of his ancestors is Christian,Count of Oldenberg, who died in 1167, and, as I mentioned earlier, one of the twopeople who founded the European dynasties of the Black Nobility. Philip was in line forthe Greek throne when, while he was still a child, another coup removed the Greekmonarchy and the family headed for France where he began his education at a privateschool in Paris. In the years 1931 and 1932 Philip’s four older sisters married into theGerman-Austrian aristocracy. Margarita married a grandson of Queen Victoria, theCzech-Austrian prince, Gottfried von Hohenlohe-Langenburg; Cecilia married a greatgrandson of Queen Victoria, Georg Donatus, Grand Duke of Hess-by-Rhine; Sophie’spartner was Prince Christoph of Hesse; and Theodora married Berthold, the Margraveof Baden.Berthold’s father was Max von Baden, the German Chancellor during World War I.Max von Baden founded a school near Lake Constantine in Germany via his personalsecretary, Kurt Hahn, who was trained at Oxford, the Brotherhood’s premier trainingground for new recruits. Hahn was head of the intelligence desk at the Berlin ForeignMinistry during the war and was Max von Baden’s advisor at the Rothschild-controlledVersailles Peace Conference. It was to their fascist school in Schloss Salem that PrincePhilip was sent to be ‘educated’. At the time it was under the control of the Nazi Partyand Hitler Youth, with Nazi race science’ on the curriculum. It had quite an impact onPhilip as we shall see. Kurt Hahn had left before Philip arrived, but he was not finishedwith the ‘education’ business. Hahn, a fascist to his core, went to Scotland and started theGordonstoun Academy, the school where Prince Charles was sent to be indoctrinated.Hahn the fascist also became an advisor to the British Foreign Office. After four years atHahn’s German Nazi school, Philip was sent to Gordonstoun on November 16th 1937 asthe approach to the Second World War gathered pace.15 The British public school system,and its equivalent in the United States and elsewhere, is a vital part of the Brotherhoodnetwork. It is the recruiting and training ground designed to turn out either psychopathsor mentally and emotionally broken people who have learned to do exactly as they aretold. You have only got to talk with some of those who have experienced it to know whata mind control operation it is. There are support groups to counsel people who have beenmentally and emotionally scarred for life by what happened to them. It is legalised childabuse. In Britain, the children of the aristocracy and wealthy families (and others whoknow no better) are taken from home at the age of six and dumped at their first boardingor ‘prep’ school. ‘Prep’ means preparation to be indoctrinated. Already they are feelingunloved and frightened as their parents drive away, leaving them in a strange placeamong strange people. I repeat these kids are just six. Can you imagine the effect of thaton a little child? From the formal, loveless life of prep school they go on to a public"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"373school. Eton and Harrow are the most famous and Prince William, the heir to the thronebehind his father, Prince Charles, was sent to Eton. At these prep and public schools,the children either conform to the rules, regulations and thought control or they incurthe wrath of the black gowns, the men in black. The ‘fagging’ system in which youngerboys become slaves to the older ones has encouraged the desire to dominate and controlothers and introduced youngsters to the ‘joys’ of inflicting pain and torture on others. Afriend of mine who was determined not to be broken by the endless beatings hereceived from both teachers and older boys, was forced to lie in ice-cold baths in anattempt to break his spirit. It is from these schools, and the Oxford and CambridgeUniversities, that the often deeply imbalanced people emerge who enter the positions offinancial, political, military and royal power. The psychopaths among them give theorders and those of broken spirit do as they are told without question, just as they havebeen trained to do. The lack of female company encourages homosexual activity andmany of these people find it very difficult to relate to women. I’m not condemninghomosexuality, by the way, everyone to their own as long as they don’t force it onanyone else. I’m just explaining what happens, that’s all. There are some strange goingson at such schools which are designed to affect the minds of the children involved.Sexual abuse is definitely part of that. Tony Blair, the Brotherhood chosen one whobecame British Prime Minister on May 1st 1997, attended the public school calledFettes College in Edinburgh, Scotland, where one of his close friends was the schoolchaplain, the Very Reverend Ronald Selby Wright, a senior figure in the Church ofScotland. Selby Wright was later revealed to be a persistent paedophile abusing boys atFettes and elsewhere.16 Blair, who is close to the Windsors, went on to OxfordUniversity and became a barrister at the ancient Inns of Court at Temple Bar in London.The public school system is horrific and schools such as Gordonstoun and SchlossSalem, which Philip attended, are at the extreme end even of that.Prince Philip’s family were supporters of the Nazi Party and by 1935 PrinceChristoph, the husband of his sister Sophie, was a colonel in the SS on Himmler’spersonal staff and head of the Forschungsamt, an Elite intelligence operation controlledby Hermann Goering. The Forschungsamt gathered intelligence on Jews and others theNazis wished to destroy, worked with the Gestapo, and also spied on members of theNazi Party itself. It was they who carried out the famous Night of the Long Kniveswhen Hitler removed his key opponents. Christoph and Sophie named their eldest child,Karl Adolf, after Adolf Hitler and Prince Philip would be involved in his education.Christoph’s brother, Philip of Hesse, was related to the King of Italy and he was theofficial liaison between the fascists of Italy and Germany. At the same time, the BritishKing, Edward VIII, was also a Nazi supporter and Philip maintained communicationswith him after his forced abdication in 1936. The official reason for this was Edward’srelationship with the American divorcee, Wallis Simpson. After just 325 days Edwardwent into exile to the Rothschild mansion in Austria and later settled in Paris.

At the end of the war, in June 1945, the British king, George VI,the father of Queen Elizabeth and husband of the Queen Mother, sent the former MISofficer, Anthony Blunt, to the Kronberg Castle of Philip’s sister Sophie, and her Nazihusband Prince Christoph of Hesse, to recover correspondence between the BritishRoyal family and their Nazi relatives.17 Blunt was the ‘Surveyor of the Queen’sPictures’ and a world expert in the paintings of Poussin, the initiate who paintedpictures called The Shepherds Of Arcadia which very much related to the mysteries ofRennes-le-Chateau. Blunt was exposed as a member of a ‘KGB’ unit inside BritishIntelligence along with Burgess, Maclean and Philby. The fifth man, who was nevernamed, was Lord Victor Rothschild (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free). In fact itwas a Brotherhood unit and not, ultimately, answerable to the KGB. When Blunt wasfinally collared in the 1980s, Queen Elizabeth apparently demanded that he was notquestioned on his clandestine mission to Kronberg Castle.18 Lord Mountbatten, thisarch manipulator for the Black Nobility, held key positions at vital moments in history.He was Supreme Commander in south east Asia during the Second World War (wherePrince Philip also served); he was the last Viceroy of India and the Governor-generalduring the British withdrawal; and he was First Sea Lord, the pinnacle of the BritishNavy, at the time of the British invasion of Suez in 1958. Mountbatten was killed by anIRA bomb in Ireland in 1979, but as these terrorist groups subcontract ‘hits’ betweeneach other the true origin of the assassination cannot be stated with certainty.The Windsor wealthThe Windsors are wealthy beyond description. The Queen’s title of the ‘richestwoman in the world’ hardly tells the story and no wonder Prince Philip calls theWindsors ‘the family firm’. They have inherited the accumulated wealth of the Queen’sBlack Nobility ancestors in land, homes, art treasures and jewels. Some of them theQueen owns and others are officially owned by the ‘state’, which, as a result, she canpass on untaxed to each generation of her family. Ownership by the state meansownership by the Black Nobility which controls the state. This is just some of theWindsor booty:The Queen has more than 300 residences, including castles or palaces likeBuckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, Kensington Palace (where Diana lived), StJames Palace, (the London base of Prince Charles), Holyrood House inEdinburgh, Balmoral Castle in Scotland and Sandringham in Norfolk whereDiana first met Prince Charles. She owns the Duchy of Lancaster with around"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"37540,000 acres of land, mostly agricultural, but including prime development sites ofenormous value. Parliament passed a bill in 1988 to allow her to develop and sellsome of this land around the Strand in London. Like much of her wealth, thecontents of the Duchy of Lancaster was stolen, in this case from Simon de Montfortjunior by the son of Henry III after de Montfort’s efforts to establish a strongparliament were defeated in 1265. If you look at the records you will probably findthat the de Montforts stole it from someone else. The Windsors own another Duchy,that of Cornwall, administered by Prince Charles. This is another 44,000 acres whichalso includes plots in the most expensive parts of London. The Queen has inheritedor purchased the world’s biggest private collection of jewels. The Koh-i-noorDiamond, then the world’s largest, was presented to Queen Victoria after the EastIndia Company had defeated the Maharajah of the Punjab in 1851. The CullinenDiamond was a peace offering to British royalty after the Boer War in South Africawhich was engineered by Cecil Rhodes, Alfred Milner, the Rothschilds and theRound Table. Other gifts have come from Arab oil sheikhs and various heads ofstate. More than 7,000 paintings and 20,000 drawings by old masters are owned bythe Royal Collection Trust which the Queen controls. She privately owns a vastcollection of other works and all this will be passed down the Windsor line when shedies, unless the nation wakes up and brings an end to the monarchy.No-one knows what the Windsors really own because it is forbidden for Parliamenteven to discuss the fact that the Queen keeps her private wealth a secret.19 Such secrecyis vital to prevent outrage by her ‘subjects’ and to allow her to use her privilege forinsider trading, a practice which is illegal. Insider trading is to be in a position to hearprivileged information which could be used to make a financial killing and then to usethat knowledge to do just that. The Queen, with her colossal portfolio of globalinvestments, is in the perfect position to make unlimited profits. She is constantly keptinformed, via meetings with prime ministers, ministers, officials, British Intelligenceand other sources, of the secret happenings in the world. She knows through thesechannels and others, where the best and worst investments are going to be and throughher secret network she can ensure that the most effective financial use is made of thatinformation. It was exposed in 1977 that the Bank of England, the creation of the BlackNobility, had established a company called the Bank of England Nominees Ltd(BOEN), to hide the Queen’s investments.20 The Windsor line has had a particularlyprofitable relationship with the City of London since the reign of Edward VII, the sonof Queen Victoria. Edward’s leading financial advisor was Ernest Cassel, the BlackNobility banker. Cassel’s daughter and heiress, Edwina, would marry Lord LouisMountbatten, the foremost influence on both Prince Philip and Prince Charles. EdwardVII, a leading Freemason, was also close to the Rothschilds, the Sassoons (an offshootof the Rothschild bloodline), and the American Payseur-Rothschild clones, Morganand Harriman. Other financial names with long royal associations are Barings andMorgan Grenfell. The private financial advisor to George VI, the father of Queen"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"376Elizabeth, was Sir Edward Peacock of Barings Bank and the Bank of England. The Kingawarded Peacock a Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order, so the advice was obviouslyvery profitable. George VI also made Lord Cromer his Lord Chamberlain, the highest rankin the Royal Household. Cromer was at one time managing director of Barings.Researchers like Philip Beresford, the author of The Book Of The British Rich, saythat Queen Elizabeth invests in the major corporations like Rio Tinto (formerly RioTinto Zinc or RTZ), Royal Dutch Shell, ICI and General Electric. This makes sensebecause these are all pillars of the Black Nobility. The Queen appears to havesubstantial investments in Rio Tinto, the biggest mining company in the world. It wasestablished in 1873 by Hugh Matheson of the global drug running operation calledJardine Matheson. Rio Tinto was in at the start of North Sea oil and, along with Texaco,was using the refineries of BP in which the Queen is also believed to have majorinvestments. The Queen would have made enormous profits at each point in theoperation and she would have had insider knowledge of the North Sea potential.Perhaps the most blatant conflict of interest to be identified was Rio Tinto’sinvolvement in a cartel formed in 1971 to fix the price of uranium. A federal grand juryand the 1976 US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, chaired by Frank Church,exposed the sting. It also included a company called Mary Kathleen Uranium ofAustralia. This company had been secretly encouraging the Aborigines to occupyuranium lands in Australia to take them out of production and so raise the price on theworld market.21 The manufactured shortage of uranium had a serious effect on theAmerican Westinghouse company who sought to take legal action against Rio Tinto forprice rigging. An American court ordered that Rio Tinto officials answer questions, butthis was quashed by the British Law Lords (Black Nobility and their clones). TheAustralian government passed legislation to the same effect. This was after theAustralian Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, had been dismissed from office by theQueen’s Governor General of Australia, Sir John Kerr. Whitlam was pursuing a policyof buying out the mining and raw material cartels, like Rio Tinto and Anglo-American,to stop them raping Australia’s resource base, while giving nothing in return. TheQueen, with enormous investments in both companies, removed Whitlam by usingsome of her wide range of ‘Prerogative Powers’ which she can instigate whennecessary. The Queen has no power these days? Sure. Part of the scam is to encouragepeople to believe that she has no power while giving her amazing powers should theneed arise for emergency action by the Brotherhood. Sir John Kerr, a former high leveloperative for British Intelligence, an arm of the Black Nobility, was made a member ofthe Privy Council and the Royal Victorian Order for his loyal and most profitableservice to the Queen’s portfolio. He was later murdered, however, when there was adanger of the truth coming out about the removal of Gough Whitlam.22The Queen has massive investments in America and many of these relate to thefounding of the Virginia Company under James I and Sir Francis Bacon which carvedup those lands from the very start. The British Crown still owns America (possibly onbehalf of the Vatican) and, with the London-based Brotherhood, the Queen enjoys an"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"377amazing income from the raw materials and other profits generated by the United States(the Virginia Company). In 1966 two US congressmen described in the congressionalrecord how the Queen owned one of the world’s largest plantations in Scott,Mississippi, close to the Arkansas border, called the Delta and Pine Land Company. Itwas worth even at that time some $44.5 million and yet it paid its hundreds of blacklabourers a pittance. Note the name, too. Delta (the triangle or pyramid) is a majorsymbol which is why the Elite US Military unit is called Delta Force. The pornographycollection in the Library of Congress is known as the Delta Collection and the Delta, orTriad, is featured in the logos of hundreds of American businesses, including DeltaAirlines. Not by coincidence Delta is also the symbol of Royal Arch Freemasonry. Thisis where the name of the Chinese organised crime operation, the Triads (triangle),comes from and the Elite grouping called the Trilateral Commission. When AdnanKhashoggi, the notorious global arms dealer, opened an American branch of hisoperation he called it Triad America. Khashoggi, a relative of the Fayeds, is an associateof George Bush, who is a close friend of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip. From 1968the Queen’s Delta and Pine company attracted US government subsidies of $1.5million. Senator McIntyre said in Congress on April 16th 1970 that the government had“Paid the Queen $120,000 for not planting cotton on farmland she owns in Mississippi”23 The New Yorker Magazine also reported that the Queen is the biggest owner of slumproperty in New York City and her holdings include the theatre district, 42nd Street.24 Itis reckoned that between 3,000 and 5,000 families own and control the world economy,but the number of people at the core of that control is far, far fewer: a relative handful.The Windsors are definitely among or very close to that inner circle Elite. ThisBrotherhood cartel controls every aspect of the global economic network, the banks,insurance companies, raw materials, transportation, factories, finished products, majorretail groups (and by market rigging all the rest), the stock and material markets,governments, media, intelligence agencies and so on. This is coordinated through thesecret societies and one of their most important vehicles is the City of London-House ofWindsor operation called the Club of the Isles. It was named after King Edward VII,Queen Victoria’s son, who was the first to carry the title Prince of the Isles. The title isheld today by Prince Charles. Edward was heavily involved with Black Nobility baronsof the Square Mile London financial district and helped them to engineer the CrimeanWar, the Russia-Japan War, the preparations for the First World War and the OpiumWars with China. Through the central organisation of the Club of the Isles comes thefantastic web of interlocking directorships which hold apparently independent’companies in a network of common control and common agenda. Some of this webinclude:The Bank of England; Anglo-American Corp of South Africa; Rio Tinto; MinorcoMinerals and Resources Corp; De Beers Consolidated Mines and De BeersCentenary AG; N.M.

Lonrho alone at the time of writing has 640subsidiares.These London-based operations connect with those in other developed anddeveloping countries giving the Black Nobility-Windsor cartels control over worldbanking and mineral, energy and food production. One of the Black Nobility companiesin the United States is Archer Daniels Midland, headed by the Bilderberger, DwayneAndreas, one of the main financial backers of the deeply corrupt US politician, BobDole, who so meekly ‘opposed’ the Brotherhood choice, Bill Clinton, in the 1996presidential election. The Black Nobility has made the City of London the worldfinancial centre since its arrival en masse with William of Orange. Today this centre ishome to over a quarter of the world’s foreign exchange turnover and the London StockExchange lists more foreign companies than any other. Ninety per cent of cross-exchange trading in Europe is handled by the City and it is the world’s biggest issuer ofEurobonds. The leading commodity futures markets in Europe are based here, as are theLondon Metal Exchange, the International Financial Petroleum Exchange and theLondon Commodity Exchange. I understand from contacts in America that it is throughorganisations like the London Metal Exchange that profits from the Virginia Company(United States of America) are channelled back to London. The City is the centre forinternational marine, aviation, and commercial insurance and reinsurance. The Citydominates world fund management for foreign institutions and governments and allthese City operations have Freemasons in prominent positions.25 More than 500 foreignbanks have offices in the City and in 1993 UK-based banks accounted for 16% oflending worldwide, an astonishing figure for these small islands.

Add to that thecontrol of the media via organisations like the BBC, the Reuters news agency, HollingerInc.,Thomson, News Corporation, Pearson, Reed Elsevier, The Washington Post, NewYork Times, NBC, CBS, ABC, etc, etc... and you control the world. More than that, thepeople don’t know this is happening and therefore you can continue indefinitelywithout challenge or exposure.One of the banks close to the Queen is Hambros plc, a Black Nobility strongholdbased in Tower Hill, London. Joseph Hambro was a banker to the kings of Denmark,Norway, and Sweden, and did much business with the Rothschilds. His son, CarlJoachim Hambro, moved from Copenhagen to London in 1839 and four years laterParliament passed legislation to make Hambros a ‘British’ bank. Like the Rothschilds,the Hambros family made much of their fortune funding wars and, again like theRothschilds, they became heavily involved in British Intelligence. J. H. ‘Jack’ Hambro,the head of the firm from 1933, ran the United Kingdom Corp, the economic warfareoperation of British Intelligence during the First World War. His son, Sir CharlesHambro, was director of the elite Special Operations Executive during the SecondWorld War while Victor Rothschild was also manipulating events within the BritishIntelligence network. It was the Special Operations Executive (SOE) which formed thecompany now known as Hollinger Inc., the media giant headed by Conrad Black, theson of the SOE agent who helped to set it up. Sir Charles Hambro’s son, Lord Hambro,now heads the firm. His CV includes Guardian Royal Exchange Insurance (chairman);the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, the drug running operationduring the Opium wars, now known as P & 0 (director); San Paolo Bank Holdings(director); and the Conservative Party (senior treasurer). Also on the Hambros Boardare Sir Chippendale Keswick of the infamous drug running family who is also connectedwith De Beers, Anglo-American and the Bank of England among many others; Hambrosdirector, Lord Kingsdowne, has a CV including Glaxo Wellcome, the Bank of England,National Westminster Bank, Redland plc, Foreign and Colonial Investment Trust,National Economic Investment Council, and the Ditchley Foundation, a Brotherhoodcircle which interlocks with others like the Bilderberg Group. Also among the Hambrodirectors are Lord Halifax and John Clay, a director of the Guardian Media Group whichclaims to be ‘anti-establishment’ while being part of the web. In the 1970s, a Hambrosdirector was Lord Carrington, close associate of Henry Kissinger and chairman of theBilderberg Group from 1991. It was during the 1970s that Hambros had a significantstake in a bank called the Banco Privata which was involved in the P2 Freemasonryscandal and was connected to the bank at the centre of the scandal, Ambrosiano Bank."},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"381The coordinator of this fraud was Michael Sindona, the main shareholder in BancoPrivata and another of his holding companies, La Centrale Finanzaria, had JocelynHambro and Evelyn de Rothschild on the board. The Sindona financial network wasfunding P2 and bleeding the Vatican Bank of enormous sums. In turn, P2 was fundingand organising terrorism in Italy including the bomb which killed 85 people at Bolognarailway station. Exposure of P2 was followed by the murder, in accordance withFreemasonic ritual, of the head of the Ambrosiano Bank, Roberto Calvi underBlackfriars Bridge in London alongside the financial district. I bet the Hambro clanwere so relieved that he wasn’t able to talk. Sindona later said that Freemasons fromSouth America had carried out the killing. Each part of the network sub-contracts itsassassinations to another branch to make the truth harder to establish. The Hambrosoperation, like all the others, stinks so high it would take the world’s supply ofdeodorant to suppress the stench. But save your most powerful air freshener for theQueen and the House of Windsor. They are connected with all the titled criminals whoare ripping off the planet and causing death, destruction and misery all over the world.And get this: if you are British you are paying them to do it! The Windsors areknowingly part of this web and their public face is a mere facade to hide the cesspitfrom which they operate behind the scenes. This control cascades out of London to therest of the world where the Elite bloodlines rule on behalf of the reptilian Agenda.The Windsor powerThe British Royal family have always been close to Freemasonry and their own orderslike the Knights of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle, and the Royal Victorian Orderinterlock with the Freemasonic networks. So, of course, does the Order of St John ofJerusalem (Knights of Malta). The expansion of Freemasonry in England in the 18thcentury coincided with the arrival of the German Hanoverian dynasty. The currentGrand Master of the English Grand Lodge in Great Queen (Semiramis/Isis) Street inLondon is the Queen’s cousin, the Duke of Kent. Prince Philip was initiated into theNavy Lodge number 2612 on December 5th 1952.27 His father in law, George VI, theQueen’s father and husband of the Queen Mother, was an ardent Mason,28 as wasEdward VII and most other monarchs since the emergence of Freemasonry. The Queenis ‘Grand Patroness’ of Freemasonry. She is served by the 390 members of the so-calledPrivy Council which connects with its equivalent in other Commonwealth countries. Itis legally above Parliament because of its prerogative powers. Its members, who areappointed for life, include Prince Philip, Prince Charles, the Archbishop of Canterbury,and the Prime Minister. Nine official meetings are held each year and the governmentministers stand to attention while the Queen is told of the government measures they areasking the Queen to approve. This Privy Council of inner-circle politicians, courtiersand public servants have to bow to the Queen and shake her hand before standing inline and they are sworn to conduct their business in the utmost secrecy.29Another of the Windsor-Black Nobility vehicles for global manipulation is theCrown Agents. This organisation was formed in 1833 as ‘Crown Agents for the"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"382Colonies’ to run the day-to-day administration in the Empire and serve as privatebankers to government officials, colonial authorities and heads of state. It also supplieda vast range of goods, including arms. Given the methods and background of the BritishEmpire, it would certainly have been involved in the drugs market. The Crown Agentshas a long history of involvement with organised crime and operates covert armsshipments into Africa which are used to cause the genocidal wars.30 This was, and is, aCrown Agency working for the monarch and yet had its entire debt guaranteed by theBritish government. In the 1970s it was bailed out by a Bank of England rescue costinghundreds of millions of pounds. For many years it managed the personal wealth of theSultan of Brunei, the friend of the Queen and a funder of many private projects forPrince Philip, Prince Charles and George Bush. The Sultan is also a financial backer ofunofficial British and American Intelligence operations31 and a man who has funded theoperation of Mohamed Al Fayed, father of Dodi. The Crown Agents were ‘privatised’ in1996 with the name Crown Agents for Overseas Government and Administrations Ltd.‘Privatisation’ is Brotherhood-speak for the transfer of power from Black Nobility viagovernment agency to Black Nobility via direct ownership. The new Crown Agents actsas a holding company for a long list of companies and ventures and it continues asbefore as a vital cog in the network throughout the world. It’s chairman, David H.Probert, is the former director of the British weapons manufacturer, Birmingham SmallArms Ltd, and a director is F. Cassell (that name again), a Companion of the Bath (aQueen-awarded title), and former executive director of the International Monetary Fundand the World Bank for Great Britain. The Crown Agents Foundation, which holds theshare capital in trust, is headed by Sir David Rowe-Ham, Knight Grand Cross of theBritish Empire. This trust includes Barclays Bank, Standard and Chartered Bank,Unilever, Tate and Lyle, Securicor (a global operator of ‘security services’), BritishTelecom, the Prince of Wales Business Leaders Forum (headed by Prince Charles), andthe Aga Khan Foundation. The same old crowd. The Crown Agents manages thecustoms services for Mozambique and, through a company called Europe SA, is incharge of all economic construction procurement for Bosnia... yes, Bosnia. It is alsoinvolved in a joint venture with a Monaco-based company, ES-KO, to provide all thefood for United Nations peacekeeping forces in Angola and Bosnia.32 So the more warsand conflict, the more money the Crown Agents has the potential to make.An important part of the Windsor-Black Nobility-City of London web are the so-called ‘City Livery Companies’. These allege to represent the various groups ofmerchants like the gun makers, stationers and newspaper makers, the goldsmiths, andsuch like. In fact they are secret societies fundamental to the control of the Cityinstitutions and much further afield. In the 1350s, in the wake of the plague known as theBlack Death, government of the City was passed from the ward councils to the CityLivery Companies. The Templars were still very active behind the scenes and the powerappeared to be concentrated in the Masons Guild. This network interlocks with itsoffshoots around the world. In 1979, the year that Margaret Thatcher became BritishPrime Minister, the Honourable Company of Freemen of the City of London of North"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"383America began to hold meetings in New York and Toronto, and on October 21st 1991the Association of Liverymen of the City of London in Hong Kong was founded and alltheir members appeared to be architects (Freemasons)33 The late author, Peter Jones,researched some of the Livery Companies in the 1990s for his book, The Obedience OfAustralia, which exposed the manipulation which led to the removal by the Queen ofAustralian Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam. These are some of the names he foundwithin these ‘Companies’:•••••Engineers: Duke of Edinburgh.•••••Airline Pilots and Navigators: Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Andrew.•••••Butchers: Queen Mother, Lord Vestey (of the meat family and the Lord Prior of theOrder of St John of Jerusalem).•••••Merchant Taylors: Queen Mother, Lord Whitelaw (alleged Satanist and formerdeputy prime minister to Margaret Thatcher), Lord Hailsham.•••••Glovers: Margaret Thatcher, Sir John Fieldhouse (the Admiral of the Fleet), both atthe forefront of the 1982 Falklands War.•••••Poulterers: Margaret Thatcher, Duchess of Devonshire (Chatsworth House).•••••Fishmongers: Duke of Devonshire, Duchess of Devonshire, C.

These groups link into the Freemasonnetworks. There are more Freemasons per square foot in the Square Mile of the City ofLondon financial centre than anywhere else on Planet Earth. The Bank of England has itsown Freemasonry Lodge (Lodge No 263), 50 do other banks like Lloyds (Black Horseof Lombard Street Lodge, No 4155), and there is the elite Guildhall Lodge, based at theMansion House since 1905. The Mansion House is the official residence of the Lord(Freemason) Mayor of London and more than 60 Mayors have been Masters of theLodge.34 Look at that Lloyd’s symbol, the Black Horse (Black Sun) of Lombard StreetLodge. Lombardy was a financial fiefdom of the Black Nobility Venetian/Phoenicians.The Windors are part of this reptilian network of financial and politicalmanipulators, Satanists and ritual child killers. Knowingly so. The network has amongits number, via its countless secret societies, the leading judges, policemen, politicians,"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"384business people, top civil servants, media owners and editors. Under these kings andgenerals of the network come the corporals and the foot soldiers who have no idea of thescale of the Agenda they are involved in. If the Brotherhood want someone framed,prosecuted, or murdered, it happens. If they want one of their people protected fromprosecution, it happens. If they want a controversial proposal like a new road, a buildingor law change to be approved, they make sure one of their guys is appointed to head theofficial ‘inquiry’ to make the decision they want. This network selects the prime ministersthrough their manipulation of all political parties and appoints the leading governmentofficials. The Black Nobility networks do the same in other countries, including, no,especially, in the United States. See .. .And the Truth Shall Set You Free for details of this.The Windsor friendsYou can tell a lot about the attitudes and motivations of people by the company theychoose to keep and those they choose to ‘honour’. It is rare for the Queen to giveknighthoods to people outside the Commonwealth and those she has chosen for such‘Honorary Knighthoods’ read like a business meeting of Brotherhood operatives. Thetitles are dubbed ‘honorary’ because the American Constitution forbids the acceptance oftitles from the monarch of a foreign state without the permission of Congress. So few ofthese honours are given because, as a British government official put it: “One must notdebase the currency”35 wonder if you think the following names debase the currency:Henry Kissinger, the Satanist, ritual child killer and mass murderer, was made KnightCommander of the Order of St. Michael and St George at a ceremony at Windsor Castle.This is normally awarded to top British diplomats and that is very appropriate becauseKissinger has always served the Black Nobility of London. This included the time when,as US Secretary of State and National Security Advisor, he manipulated the Watergateaffair to remove Richard Nixon and replace him with the rapist and child abuser, GeraldFord, and his vice-president, Nelson Rockefeller (See .. And The Truth Shall Set YouFree). Kissinger ‘gofer’ Brent Scowcroft, an executive of Kissinger Associates and topadvisor to George Bush, was made an Honorary Knight of the British Empire by theQueen. So was Casper Weinberger, another Bush clone, who was involved in the Iran-Contra drugs-for-arms scandal. George Bush himself, the paedophile, ritual child killer,mass murderer and Satanist, is a very close friend of the Windsors. The Queen made himan Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, as she did with thatBrotherhood script-reader and rapist of mind controlled slaves, Ronald Reagan, himself aproduct of mind control. This is the highest award it is possible for her to give tosomeone outside the Commonwealth. The Order of the Bath sounds a silly title unlessyou understand the symbolism. The resurrection bath of alchemy symbolises rebirth andpurification or absolution. Baths are given to Masonic ‘Knights of the Bath’ before theyperform horrendous deeds, hence ‘blood baths’ 36 George Bush and the Queen get on sowell because they are both of European ‘royal’ and aristocratic-reptilian blood. They areboth shape-shifters. George and his wife, Barbara Pierce Bush (of Merrill, Lynch,Fenner, and Smith), are descended from the same Pierce family of England as the"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"385American President, Franklin Pierce. The Pierce family is, in fact, the powerful Percyaristocratic family of England which changed its name to Pierce and some of thememigrated to America when their involvement became known in the failed gunpowderplot which attempted to blow up Parliament. One of the Percy homes where the planwas hatched was called Syon House.37 Other Bush relatives include the Grosvenorfamilies of England and America and the Taft family of Ohio. The English Grosvenorsare the Dukes of Westminster who own the prime properties in the City of London, thefinancial headquarters of the Black Nobility. The Grosvenors of America founded theNational Geographic which is notorious for removing the archaeological treasures ofthe world, especially those with religious significance, and relocating them at theSmithsonian Institute in Washington DC. The Institute is controlled by the Grosvenor’scousins, the Smithsons, who are also descended from the Percys.38 The ancestry ofGeorge Bush can also be traced to England’s King Alfred the Great and toCharlemagne, the celebrated monarch who served the Brotherhood Agenda in France inthe eighth and ninth centuries. The same genealogical line can be traced to 32 otherPresidents of the United States, who are therefore all related to Bush.39 The Queen wasmost grateful to Bush and her other friends who manipulated and ‘won’ the Gulf War.The military commander, Stormin’ Norman Schwarzkopf, who has lied through histeeth about the cause of Gulf War Syndrome, and Cohn (Colon) Powell, theBrotherhood’s chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were both awarded by her mostgracious majesty, fawn, fawn, the title of Honorary Knight of the British Empire.Douglas Fairbanks, the actor and tool of the British and US military, was aide-de-campto the Satanist and fascist, Lord Mountbatten, and was rewarded with a stream ofchivalric honours, including Knight of the British Empire.Another name that stands out is Paul Mellon, a very close friend of the Queen. Shemade him an Honorary Knight of the British Empire. The Dutch wing of the BlackNobility, through Prince Philip’s buddy, the SS officer, Prince Bernhard, made Mellon aKnight of the Order of Orange Nassau. The title is in honour of William of Orange andthe secret society, the Orange Order. Paul Mellon is a central figure in the London-based control of the United States by another incredible network of families, includingthe Rockefellers, Harrimans, Bushes, Kennedys and Morgans, which is based in NewYork, Virginia (Washington) and Boston. Thus it is known as the Eastern Establishment.The Mellon family association with the Windsors goes back a long time. Paul’s motherwas an heiress to the Guiness fortune and his father, Andrew Mellon, became aconfidant of the Windsors when he was US Ambassador to London (the ‘Court of StJames’s’) in 1932 and 33. He was followed by another Brotherhood crook, JosephKennedy, the father of JFK. Mellon was three times US Secretary of the Treasury underPresidents Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover, representing Black Nobility interests. It washe who financed the creation of the aluminium cartel known as ALCOA to control theprice and supply of aluminium, in the same way the Brotherhood have done with oil,gold, diamonds, drugs, ad infinitum. It was Mellon and ALCOA which introduced thepolicy of putting fluoride into drinking water to make money from a by-product of the"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"386aluminium industry which at the time they were struggling to dispose of. It has nothingto do with saving teeth. Fluoride was actually used as a rat poison for 40 years and it isan intellect suppressant. See The Robots’ Rebellion for that story. Andrew Mellonfinanced the creation of Gulf Oil which worked closely with British Petroleum(formerly Anglo-Persian). One of their operations was the coup against the IranianPrime Minister, Dr Mohammed Mossadegh, in 1953. Mossedagh wanted to stop theexploitation of his country, but the Anglo-American Elite conspired against him andimposed on the Iranian people the vicious, murderous regime of the Shah of Iran. Oneof the people involved in the coup was Norman Schwarzkopf senior, the father of theGulf War commander so honoured by the Queen. This story is told at length in .. .AndThe Truth Shall Set You Free. Andrew Mellon was also behind the Dawes and YoungPlans which financed the Nazi war machine and caused the economic collapse inGermany that brought Adolf Hitler to power. His son, Paul Mellon, was brought up inEngland, but returned to the United States to attend Yale University, home of the Skulland Bones Society. He turned down membership of that, but instead joined the Scrolland Key, another Brotherhood operation. After Yale, it was back to England to study atCambridge University where so many British Intelligence operatives are spotted andrecruited. His father and mother divorced and he settled with her in Virginia, some 40miles from Washington DC, where you find names for counties like Loudoun andOrange. This area had long been occupied by the US representatives of the BlackNobility like the Harrimans. The Queen and Prince Philip have often visited PaulMellon at his Rokeby Estate in Virginia and both Prince Charles and Princess Annehave been there.40 Prince Philip went to Mellon to fund the World Wildlife Fund.Buckingham Palace told Executive Intelligence Review investigator, Scott Thompson:“I am commanded by The Queen to thank you for your letter... concerning Mr. PaulMellon. The Queen has known Mr. Mellon for many years and visited his estate atUpperville, Virginia, probably for the first time in the 1950s.”41The Queen was following in the footsteps of her uncle, the ill-fated Nazi supporterEdward VIII, the Duke of Windsor, who abdicated in 1936 to marry Wallis Simpson. PaulMellon’s sister, Ailsa, was part of the Duke’s intimate circle of friends in Virginia. WallisSimpson, formerly Wallis Warfield, attended the exclusive Foxcroft School in this area.Another of the Queen’s close friends, and the Mellons’, is William Farish III. The Queenkeeps some of her breeding mares at his Lane’s End Farm, near Versailles, Kentucky, andshe has been a regular visitor. Paul Mellon often flies in by private jet to join them.William Farish III is a close associate of the Queen’s close friend, George Bush. Farishcame to prominence when he was the keeper of Bush’s ‘blind trust’, the system in whichpresidents are not supposed to know where their money is invested while in office. Unlikethe Queen! But, of course, it’s all a sham and Bush made a fortune for his owninvestments while in office, as does the Queen. I can see why the Queen and Prince Philipenjoy the company of Farish. His grandfather, William Farish senior, was the president of"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"387the Rockefellers’ Standard Oil of New Jersey during the Second World War when it wassupplying oil and technological know-how to the Nazis and their chemical giant I. G.Farben which operated the slave camp at Auchwitz. Indeed Standard Oil and I. G.Farben were basically the same company. .. .And The Truth Shall Set You Free will giveyou the background to all this. Wherever you look, the Windsors can’t seem to avoidNazis, Nazi sympathisers and supporters.The Windsor genocideThe numerous Anglo-Dutch alliances and intrigues are, in truth, nothing to do with theBritish and Dutch people. If we are going to stop being duped, we have to stopscreaming “It’s the British”, “It’s the Dutch”, “It’s the Americans”, “It’s the Germans ,Its the French”, “It’s the whites”, “It’s the blacks”, “It’s the Jews”, or even “It’s thereptilians”. It is not all these peoples that are involved, it is certain bloodlines andfactions within them. Blaming one race, nation or belief system is precisely what theBrotherhood want us to do, because if people are divided amongst themselves they willbecome disunited, quarrelsome or even become warring factions. Divide and rule.Manipulation comes from a network of bloodlines and their ‘gofers’ who work throughall these countries and groups while keeping the population in ignorance. The closecooperation between ‘Britain’ and the ‘Netherlands’ means the British and Dutch wingsof the Black Nobility. This is definitely the case with Prince Philip, the consort of theQueen of England, and Prince Bernhard, the consort of Queen Juliana of theNetherlands until she stepped down for her daughter, Beatrix. Philip and Bernhard arefrom the same reptilian bloodline and both have a Nazi view of life and people. Philipand his family are steeped in Nazi connections and Bernhard was a member ofHimmler’s murderous SS. He was born a German in 1912, the cousin-in-law of PrincessVictoria of Hohenzollern, the sister of Kaiser Wilhelm. He was recruited into NaziIntelligence at the University of Berlin in 1934 and worked for the SS operation withinI. G. Farben, the chemical giant which had such close connections with the Rockefeller/Farish Standard Oil and British companies like ICI. Bernhard’s background caused ascandal in the Netherlands when he married Queen Juliana of the infamous House ofOrange, to become the Netherlands equivalent of his bosom buddy, Prince Philip.Bernhard helped to found the Bilderberg Group which officially met for the first time in1954, and in 1961 he co-founded, with Philip, the World Wildlife Fund (now the WorldWide Fund For Nature), funded in part by the Mellons.Lets get one thing straight here. The World Wide Fund For Nature (WWF) was notcreated to save endangered species. Its record on that front is quite appalling as asuppressed report by the Oxford professor John Phillipson revealed in 1989.42 A fewmonths before Philip launched the WWF, he was with the Queen on a royal tour ofIndia. This included a tiger shoot in which a tiger was lured into range by tethered goatsto be shot dead by Philip the ‘conservationist’43 This later caused worldwide outragewhen the story and a photograph of Philip standing over the tiger found its way into thenewspapers. On the same tour, this time in Kathmandu, Philip was in a shooting party"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"388with Alec Douglas Hume (Lord Home), the Conservative Prime Minister, BilderbergGroup chairman and bloodline of the Scottish Brotherhood families. Ian MacPhail, theWWF’s first international appeals director, told a British television crew how a motherelephant and her calf came into range. Philip shot the mother and her calf ran off interror. MacPhail said he helped to cover up the incident because the WWF was about tobe launched and he believed the Fund would benefit wildlife conservation. He laterthought differently:“...with a heavy heart I have to report that I was wrong. The rhino, the elephant and thepanda missed the boat, and the new Noah’s Ark sailed on without them.”44It has always mystified the public to see the contradiction between Philip, thefounder and driving force behind the WWF, and Philip the killer of animals and birdsfor the sheer enjoyment of it. The same with WWF ‘conservationist’ Prince Charlesriding with the hounds to tear a fox to pieces. But there is no contradiction, that’s thepoint. Philip, like Bernard, doesn’t give a stuff about animal welfare. The WWF wascreated for very different reasons. It is a vehicle for controlling wildlife parks in Africaand elsewhere in which terrorist groups and mercenaries can gather, train, and crossborders to bring genocide to places like Rwanda and Burundi. The WWF coordinatesand funds the systematic slaughter of people and animals and has made a fortune fromthe illegal trade in ivory it was supposed to be trying to stop. Much of this is being paidfor by donations from the public who think they are supporting wildlife and collectedby fund-raisers in the towns and cities who believe the same. The best contribution youcan make to the protection of wildlife is to stop funding the WWF in my view. Sir PeterScott, the celebrated conservationist, was another founder of the WWF and in 1972 hecommissioned a report by a big game hunter, Ian Parker, into the illegal trade inelephant tusks and rhino horn. Parker produced evidence that the family of the KenyanPresident, Jomo Kenyatta, was at the centre of this trade. He also named Kenya’s mostprominent ‘conservationists’ as the poachers. Within hours of handing his report toScott, Parker was arrested by Kenyan Special Branch, beaten for three days, and told ifhe did not shut up his wife would be killed.45 Parker’s report was never published byScott and at around the same time Prince Bernhard, as WWF International President,awarded Kenyatta the ‘Order of the Golden Ark’ for saving the rhino!46I need do no more than list some of the names in the WWF’s 1001 Club to showwhere this organisation is really coming from. This is an exclusive group, formed byPrince Bernhard in 1971, to raise money for the WWF’s ‘activities’. The members,recruited by invitation only as with all the Brotherhood secret societies, give a largeannual donation. Here is a flavour of the membership of the 1001 Club over the years:Conrad Black: agent for British Intelligence and head of the Hollinger mediaempire which was originally formed by his father, George, a British Intelligenceoperative. Black is a member of the steering committee of the Bilderberg Group;Prince Johannes von Thurn und Taxis (deceased): one of the most prominent"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"389Venetian families of the Black Nobility and the Holy Roman Empire.

Lifemagazine exposed Rosenbaum’s bank as a money launderer for the Meyer LanskyUS-based organised crime network and Rosenbaum was also a backer of Permindex,the assassination unit of British Intelligence which was at the centre of theassassination of John E Kennedy (see ..

Given knighthoods by both the British and Dutch royal families andBernhard’s successor in 1977 as International President of WWE47Yes, sounds like a bunch of conservationists, doesn’t it? Martin Palmer, an advisor toPhilip on environmental matters, said the WWF was a “missionary organisation” 48 It is,too. The first wave of missionaries began the destruction of Africa and South andCentral America, and now the latest wave, in the guise of operations like the WWF, areseeking to finish the job. The environment is being used as a central plank in theBrotherhood Agenda and I speak as someone who saw the movement from within whenI was a national spokesman for the British Green Party in the late 1980s. To those whocondemn environmentalists as ‘eco-fascists’ I can tell you that, like all the organisationsused by the Brotherhood, including the Freemasons, the vast majority would behorrified at the thought of playing a part in the Agenda I am exposing. Most of themare decent people, incredibly naive and sometimes incredibly arrogant, but certainlynot fascists. Once again it is the manipulating core who are fascists that we have toidentify and we won’t do that by screaming abuse at everyone who talks aboutconservation. The same is true of the so-called New Age movement which is beingmanipulated beyond belief. One of the New Age heroes is the Dalai Lama, yet anotherworld figure who is not what he seems to be. Nancy Nash, the former director of the"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"390WWF, was transferred to become the Dalai Lama’ s minder and controller. In .. And TheTruth Shall Set You Free, I detail the manipulation of the global environmentalmovement through organisations like the Club of Rome and individuals like theCanadian oil millionaire (and the rest), Maurice Strong. Not surprisingly, Strong hasbeen a member of the WWF 1001 Club and so has Alexander King, the co-founder ofthe Club of Rome in 1968 with Aureho Peccei, the Fiat executive and number two toGiovanni Agnelli, one of the foremost members of the Black Nobility and an innercircle member of the Bilderberg Group. Strong is also close to the Dalai Lama and anadvisor to Kofi Annan, Secretary-general of the United Nations.The environment is being used in many ways to further the Agenda through problem-reaction-solution. If you are looking to impose global ‘solutions’ you need global‘problems’ and the environment is perfect for that. It allows you to pass internationallaws and create centralised, global organisations to police them. It allows you to movenative peoples from their ancient lands to create wildlife parks and ‘conservation’ areasall over the world, particularly Africa and the Americas, which then come under yourcentralised control. It gives you footholds in strategic areas from which you can launch‘freedom fighters’ to start civil wars. The advantages are endless. Transnationalagreements like the Biodiversity Treaty are handing control of large tracts of land in theUnited States and elsewhere to United Nations control.49 The situation is the same as inAfrica where the parks are administered by outside agencies over which the people haveno control. The ‘Global Biodiversity Strategy’ was launched by the International Unionfor Conservation of Nature (IUCN) the Swiss-based organisation formed by Sir JulianHuxley in 1948 with a constitution written by the British Foreign Office. This sits at thecentre of a network connecting 68 countries, 103 government agencies and 640 non-government organisations. It worked with others like the Rockefeller-funded WorldResources Institute in the United States headed by Lester Brown (CFR), and its strategywas presented at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit by... Maurice Strong, the Windsor-BlackNobility leg-man, who with his wife, is also seeking to play the same scam with the NewAge Movement. One of his vehicles for this is the Dalai Lama.The Club of Rome was formed by the Brotherhood at the Rockefeller estate in Italy in1968 to launch the environmental movement on the world. All the major globalenvironmental reports saying there is an environmental crisis and something must bedone, have been funded and fronted by the very people who are dismantling the planet’secology and killing the wildlife. Maurice Strong is a major voice in the Club of Rome.Canada is still a Commonwealth country and it acts as a massive centre for Windsor-Black Nobility operations. This is why so many Canadians, including Strong, ConradBlack, the Bronfman gangster family, and prime ministers like Pierre Trudeau and BrianMulroney, are involved in the game. Strong is also part of the Rockefeller organisation,leading representatives of the Windsor-Black Nobility in the United States. Strong servedwith the Rockefeller Foundation which shares a common leadership with all the other‘independent’ foundations in the United States like Ford and Carnegie. His main role inthe past 20 years, however, has been to front the manipulation of the environmental"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"391movement.

Who compiled the document calledGlobal 2000, Report To The President, during the Carter administration in America?Cyrus Vance (CFR, TC, Bil) and other Brotherhood personnel. Strong is a member ofthe infamous Aspen Institute in Colorado formed by the Bilderberger Robert 0.Anderson of Atlantic Richfield Oil (ARCO). His company has a pyramid with a missingcapstone as its logo. Anderson was a funder of the environmental group, Friends of theEarth, which, at the highest level, interlocks with others like Greenpeace, WWF, theSierra Club, Survival International, Earth First, World Resources Institute, theZoological Society of London, Royal Geographical Society, Nature Conservancy, theFlora and Fauna Preservation Society, the United Nations Education, Scientific andCultural Organisation (UNESCO), and many, many others. These provide another webof national and international agencies through which to organise covert operationswhich often have no connection to ‘conservation’.The assault on Africa and other developing countries by Prince Philip and his WWFis part of an ongoing operation. The Royal Geographical Society, which was founded in1830 and given a royal charter in 1859, sponsored the expeditions into Africa of DoctorDavid Livingstone and Sir Richard Burton which helped to open up the continent toexploitation and takeover by the European Black Nobility. When the European invasionof Africa began it was also achieved through organisations chartered by the BritishCrown, including the British South Africa Company of Cecil Rhodes, the British EastAfrica Company and the Royal Niger Company. The operation was a mirror of whathappened in America with the Virginia Company. One of the leading lights in the RoyalGeographical Society in the last century was Francis Galton, founder of the eugenics(master race) movement which continues today under the heading of ‘populationcontrol’. This is a favourite theme of Prince Philip and his American paedophile andSatanist friend George Bush (see .. And The Truth Shall Set You Free). The ZoologicalSociety of London was founded in 1826 by Sir Stamford Raffles, the Brotherhood’sViceroy of India and founder of Singapore. Prince Philip is a former president of thisorganisation and it connects with the Zoological Society of New York and Frankfurt,two other major Brotherhood centres. The boards of these two organisations and theWWF are virtually the same.The Sierra Club was founded in 1892 by John Muir with funding from theAmerican bloodline family, the Harrimans, who also funded Galton’s eugenicsmovement. It was the leaders of the Sierra Club in Canada who started Greenpeace in1971 and David Ross Brower, former executive director of the Sierra Club, was thefounder of Friends of the Earth in 1969. Ross Brower moved to England in 1970 withfunding from Rothschild interests, the billionaire financier and Rothschild cousinJames Goldsmith, and the zoo owner John Aspinall, who, with Goldsmith, was a close"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"392friend of Lord Lucan, the missing earl still wanted for the murder of the family nanny.Friends of the Earth reached its peak of prominence in Britain under the directorship ofJonathan Porritt, the son of the former British governor-general of New Zealand, andlater an advisor to Prince Charles. The founder of FOE in France, Brice LaLonde, was apartner in a Rockefeller law firm and became environment minister to the Frenchpresident, the high level Freemason and friend of the Rothschilds, Francois Mitterrand,under whose reign the black glass pyramid was erected alongside the Louvre Museum.As with Prince Philip, people were surprised when the late Sir James Goldsmith becamea ‘born again’ environmentalist after a lifetime of financial manipulation and‘investment’ which served both the Brotherhood Agenda and devastated theenvironment. Again, there are no contradictions when you understand the plan they areworking to. Goldsmith, formerly Goldschmidt, had a German-English father and aFrench mother. His father, Frank, was a friend of Winston Churchill and became aConservative MP. The Goldschmidts had joined forces with other Rothschild cousins,the Bischoffsheims, to form a banking partnership which financed the North in theAmerican Civil War.50 Goldsmith’s family were part of the Black Nobility financial webin Europe and there is no doubting the source of Goldsmith’s ‘inspiration’ when hesuddenly sold all his stocks just before the enormous stock-market crash of 1987. Hefurther served the Brotherhood by launching the Referendum Party in Britain to hijackthe anti-European Union opposition and lead it to failure. It also split the Conservativevote in key constituencies which helped the Brotherhood choice, Tony Blair, to becomePrime Minister. Part of this strategy involved the former Conservative Party Treasurer,the Satanist and paedophile, Lord McAlpine, making a very public transfer toGoldsmith’s party and he later became its leader. Goldsmith’s elder brother Edward,‘Teddy’, founded The Ecologist magazine and has connections with the WWF.According to published reports, Teddy and James Goldsmith have long had close tieswith the Wall Street banker, John Train, the brother of Russell Train, the president ofWWF USA. Russell Train is also the top trustee of the African Wildlife Foundation, andintimate of Prince Philip and George Bush. John Train comes from a bloodline familyand his grandfather was a founder of the J. P. Morgan banking group. He married intothe Venetian Cmi family and his, now divorced, wife was the daughter of Vittono Cmiwho played a major role in the fascist movement in Italy in the 1930s. Train has deepties with the intelligence community and is a ‘gofer’ for both Bush and the Windsors.51The environmental network is just part of the web through which Prince Philip andhis WWF genocide operations can work and I stress most emphatically that most ofthose who work for and support the WWF are genuine people who have no idea of theAgenda they are unwittingly serving. The Crown companies which stole Africa from itspeople in the 19th century spawned many of their modern day equivalents whocontinue what people like Cecil Rhodes began. The Lonrho (London-Rhodesia)company, headed most famously by the late Tiny Rowland, was a subsidiary of Rhodes’British South Africa Company and has been responsible for much of the genocide andwar in Africa which has kept the people divided and ruled. At the time of writing,"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"393Lonrho has 640 subsidiaries in 48 countries. It is the biggest food producer in Africa,the biggest distributor of motor vehicles, and the biggest producer of textiles. It evenproduces 90% of British, sorry, Her Majesty’s, postage stamps.82 Tiny Rowland waslittle more than a figurehead to take the blame for what the Queen and the Windsorswere orchestrating on behalf of the Black Nobility. The real power behind theupgrading and expansion of Lonrho was Harley Drayton, the personal financialmanager to the British Crown, and Angus Ogilvy, the husband of Princess Alexandra,the Queen’s first cousin.53 Contacts in Canada tell me that Ogilvy is very active theretoo, in the Windsor operations. Princess Alexandra is the head of WWF-UK.54 Otherexploiters of the great African continent today include Rio Tinto, Anglo-American,Minorco, De Beers, Barclays, Shell, N.M. Rothschild, Imperial Chemical Industries(ICI), and Unilever, all, or most of whom, are reported to enjoy substantial investmentsby the Queen. Incidentally, Lord Melchett, the grandson of the founder of ICI, a pillarof the world chemical cartel, became head of Greenpeace, United Kingdom. The threebiggest mining companies in the world, Anglo-American, Rio Tinto, and Minorco, arein truth the same operation. Minorco is the international holding company for theOppenheimer empire, the family which have monopolised the world diamond marketwith the Rothschilds through De Beers, the company established by Cecil Rhodes in1880. Twenty directors of Minorco are also directors of Anglo-American, which is alsofull of De Beers personnel.The destruction of Africa can be described in three distinct phases. First the invasionand overt control of the continent by the Black Nobility branches of Europe, the British,Dutch, Belgians, Germans, Portuguese and French. Then came the transition fromcolonial rule by physical occupation to rule by financial occupation via corruptpresidents and prime ministers imposed by the Brotherhood. Anyone seeking powerwho will not play the game is removed by assassination, scandal or coup. The faceschange, but the masters stay the same. Rhodesia became Zimbabwe under themanipulation of Britain’s Margaret Thatcher (Bil) and Lord Carrington (RIIA, TC, Bil,Comm 300), but all that happened was that the white dictatorship of Ian Smith wasreplaced by the dictatorship of Robert Mugabe. The lives of the people of Africa havenot changed because the same people are still in control. Only now its more difficult tospot them because they work behind the scenes. The third phase of this Africanoperation is to turn the continent into a bloodbath which will destroy all coherentsociety and justify the imposition of rule by NATO and United Nations ‘peacekeepers’.The environment is being used as an excuse to steal more and more land and the debtcrisis is being ‘solved’ by the banks of the Brotherhood offering to forgive ‘debt’ inreturn for the rights to the mineral resources - forever.The mass murder in places like Algeria, Rwanda and Burundi is not spontaneous, ithas been organised in great detail, just as the conflict and genocide in the formerYugoslavia, Afghanistan, Cambodia, Laos, Sri Lanka, etc, have been.

And The Truth, is a front for the Brotherhood,although its genuine employees and volunteers have no knowledge of this. You don’tneed an intelligence test to know why Elizabeth Dole, the wife of Bob Dole, is head ofthe Red Cross in America. Other apparently genuine organisations like Oxfam andAmnesty International are also used for Brotherhood manipulation. Afghan Aid UK wasa vehicle through which the Mujahideen terrorists were organised and deployed totrigger the war in Afghanistan.56 It was headed by Viscount Cranborne (Robert Cecil).The Cecil family are one of the oldest Black Nobility bloodlines in Britain and weremost active in the time of Cecil Rhodes. Robert Cecil’s great-great-grandfather was theThird Marquess of Salisbury, the prime minister who helped to manipulate the outbreakof the First World War. Another intelligence operative involved in the creation of theAfghanistan war was Lord Bethell, the Lord in Waiting to the Queen, who ran RadioFree Kabul.57 The Windsor-Black Nobility covert operations create the ‘terrorist’ groupsand ‘freedom fighters’ then light the fuse and watch hundreds of thousands of people,sometimes millions, be slaughtered. They can rely on their media barons like Black,Murdoch, Turner and Packer to sell the public a smokescreen story through ‘journalists’who mostly haven’t got a clue what is happening.Game reserves and national parks already account for more than eight per cent of theland in sub-Saharan Africa and in Tanzania it is 40%.58 Under some of these lands arefantastic reserves of mineral resources and in some cases untapped reserves of uranium.The ‘parks’ are often in strategic areas across borders and those who administrate themcan keep out anyone they choose. Who administrates them? Agencies like PrincePhilip’s WWF and other Brotherhood organisations such as the International Union forthe Conservation of Nature, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, and the UNDevelopment Programme. They employ military and intelligence personnel to do thisand as such they are subverting the sovereignty of the African nations. Two horrifyingexamples are Operation Stronghold and Operation Lock. Stronghold was supposed tobe supporting the Zimbabwe Department of National Parks and Wildlife Managementto save 700 black rhinos in the Zambezi Valley, but it emerged that the Chief GameRanger Glen Tatham and his staff were simply killing ‘poachers’ without warning.Official figures show that between July 1984 and September 1991, 145 ‘poachers’were killed, most of them from a helicopter funded by Prince Philip’s WWF andmanned by WWF contract employees.59 But when you look at the figures moreclosely, you find that the overwhelming majority of those killed were unarmed! Whyno prosecutions then? Because when the story first came to light a bill was rushedthrough the Zimbabwe Parliament called the Protection of Wildlife (Indemnity) Actwhich gave the game wardens immunity from prosecution.60 The WWF was now ableto kill whoever it liked whenever it liked in the reserves. In Operation Lock, the WWFdeployed an elite squad of SAS men to ‘neutralise’ the cartels smuggling wildlife andwildlife ‘products’. It turned out that these SAS guys had started to deal themselves inthe illegal sale of ivory and rhino horn.61 People on the ground in Africa have long"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"395known that the main killers of wildlife in the parks are those, often employed by theWWF, who are supposed to be protecting them.The Operation Lock scandal erupted in late 1989 and early 1990 and it should alsobe noted that, as with Operation Stronghold, the arrival of the SAS coincided with arapid rise in the number of dead ‘poachers’. This is not surprising given that the trainingof ‘elite’ squads such as the SAS, the Parachute Regiment, the Green Berets, the DeltaForce, and such like, is designed to turn out fully qualified psychopaths. Theorganisation of the WWF’s Operation Lock was headed by Colonel David Stirling, thefounder of the SAS during World War Two. He formed a company for the operationwhich he named KAS Enterprises, a name inspired by his membership of the CapricornAfrica Society (CAS), which in the words of the governor of Kenya Sir Philip Kerr, wascreated to ‘preserve apartheid in a sugar coating’ 62 The treasurer of Capricorn AfricaSociety, Mervyn Cowne, was the man behind the Kenyan park system along withElspeth Huxley. She married into the family of Julian Huxley, the inspiration behind theInternational Union for the Conservation of Nature, the architects of ‘biodiversity’, andan organisation with a constitution written by the British Foreign Office. Theinterconnecting web is incredible. The Queen and Prince Philip knew exactly whatStirling’s SAS assault team were going to do in Operation Lock. Stirling is extremelyclose to the Windsors and played a significant role in the Queen’s Coronation ceremonyunder the title of the ‘Golden Stick’.63 As a Scottish aristocrat, Stirling was particularlyclose to the Queen Mother, another Black Nobility Scottish bloodline who is certainlynot the person she appears to be in her public charade as the nation’s ‘grandma’.Stirling, along with all members of the SAS, MIS, M16 and so on, swears his oath ofloyalty to the monarch, not the state. You can’t even take your seat as a British MPunless you make the same pledge even though you have been elected by the people.Stirling admitted he had been in close contact with the British Defence and ForeignMinistries, two other links in the Windsor-Brotherhood chain. Stirling’s operationalofficer in KAS and Operation Lock was Lt Colonel Ian Crooke, one of the hooded menon the balcony when his SAS team stormed the Iranian Embassy in London in May1980, while millions watched on live television.64 People like this were employed byPrince Philip and his WWF to protect wildlife in Africa? No, no, they were there as partof the Windsor-Black Nobility operation to turn Africa into a devastated blood bath.The wildlife parks are used as safe havens for the Brotherhood-Windsor-sponsoredterrorists responsible for so much genocide in Africa. Nearly 20 per cent of Rwanda iscovered by these reserves. The 1990 invasion of Rwanda by the ‘Rwanda PatrioticFront’ (RPF) came via the Gorilla Park and Akagera Park in Uganda on the Rwanda-Zaire border, and the Volcans Park in Rwanda.The RPF (a British-controlled terrorist force) were also based in parts of theVirunga Park in Zaire.65 A few months before these events, a ‘gorilla protectionprogramme’ had begun in the Virunga, Gorilla and Volcan Parks. This programmewas administered by... the WWF. In 1994 the ‘Rwanda Patriotic Front’ invadedRwanda via the Akagera Park to trigger a conflict which has so far killed well in"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"396excess of a million people. I understand the violence began shortly after a ‘diplomaticmission’ to Rwanda by Henry Kissinger and Lord Carrington and it followed the sale ofweapons to Rwanda by the Israeli government, then headed by Yitzhak Rabin. In truththis invasion was not by the ‘Rwanda Patriotic Front’ (RPF) at all. Almost every memberof that group was a soldier in the ‘National Resistance Army’ (NRA) of Uganda’sPresident Museveni. The leaders of both the RFP and the NRA are the same! TheRwanda Patriotic Front’s David Tinyefuza was the Ugandan Minister for Defence, whilstPaul Kagame the Rwanda Defence Minister under the RPF was head of Intelligence andCounter-Intelligence in the Ugandan army, and the RPF’s Chris Bunyenyezi is theformer commander of the Ugandan army’s murderous 306th Brigade.66 The same crowdunder Museveni were involved in the attempted coup in Burundi in 1993 in whichPresident Melchior Ndadaye was murdered and an estimated 100,000 people lost theirlives.67 Another aspect of this policy in Africa, and Central and South America, is toreduce the population of what Henry Kissinger calls the “useless eaters”. The genocidein Africa is being coordinated to a large extent out of Uganda which has long beencontrolled by the Windsor-Black Nobility cartels of banking, business and intelligenceagencies. The British Minister of Overseas Development at the time was MargaretThatcher’s favourite, Lynda Chalker, who had a number of meetings with Museveni andhis officials. South Africa with the end of Nelson Mandela’s presidency is going to be amajor target for those who are working to turn black against black to justify theintervention of the white peace keepers. We have seen only the start of the problems inthe African continent: it is time for the people there to open their eyes.Exactly the same operation is being played out in the Americas and Australia wherethe same names and techniques are there to see. In South and Central America,Brotherhood-controlled governments are ‘privatising’ their mineral and miningcompanies and handing them to the Black Nobility-Windsor cartels, particularly RioTinto, Anglo-American, Barrick Gold and Newmont Mining. Barrick Gold, based inToronto, was formed in 1981 by Adnan Khashoggi, the Saudi financier and global armstrader and the uncle of Dodi Fayed. Peter Munk, formerly with the British royalhousehold, became chairman of Barrick which appeared from nowhere to be the secondbiggest gold producer in the world.68 One reason for this was the active involvement ofthe George Bush-Harriman networks. Khashoggi was a backer of President Bush’s Iran-Contra drug-for-arms operation (see .. And The Truth Shall Set You Free). NewmontMining is based in Denver, Colorado, a highly significant, and growing, Brotherhoodcentre. It appears to be an American company, but is once again controlled fromLondon. It has been owned by the Hanson group who sold it to James Goldsmith. Hesold 14% to George Soros, one of the Brotherhood’s most active and identifiablefinancial manipulators, especially on behalf of the Rothschilds. Other shareholders inNewmont are Lord Jacob Rothschild, the Fidelity Mutual Fund, and Boston-based drugsyndicates.69 Alongside the assault on South America by the mineral corporations hascome the takeover of the continent’s banking system by the City of London cartel, ledby HSBS (Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank which owns Midland Bank) and their"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"397interlocking American and Canadian counterparts like Citibank, the Bank of Montreal,and the Bank of Nova Scotia or Scotiabank.70The Queen is Commander-in-Chief of all armed forces in the United Kingdom and thecountries of the Commonwealth. The British army is deployed in many strategic parts ofthe world either directly or via the NATO and UN peacekeeping operations. Britishmilitary ‘advisors’ are at work in some 30 countries. Every week the Queen is briefed bythe Joint Intelligence Committee on all secret operations. (I wonder if she briefs them onhers?) The Windsor-Black Nobility has its own private armies, too. Among these are theCorps of Commissionaires and Defence Systems Ltd. The Corps of Commissionaires wasformed, like Crown Agents, under royal sponsorship in 1859 when the British Empire wasat the peak of its powers. The idea, so they said, was to find employment for soldierscoming home from the Crimean War and a number were deployed as armed anduninformed security guards at the Black Nobility buildings in the City of London.Branches followed in Australia, South and East Africa, New Zealand and Canada. Anothernetwork had been created to post British military personnel and their families to strategiccentres. After the election of Margaret Thatcher in 1979, the Corps of Comissionaires wasreorganised and a new division was established to provide ‘specialist security functions’.More members of the military and paramilitary elite were employed and the Queen, thePatron of the Corps of Commissionaires, hosted a reception at Buckingham Palace in1986 to celebrate the expansion. The Corp’s Board of Governors in every country werefull of the loyal friends of the Queen and Prince Philip. These included Major GeneralDavid Alexander, Companion of the Bath and former Equerry and Treasurer to Philip, andAir Marshall Sir Thomas Kennedy, Knight Grand Cross of the Bath, Commander of theBritish Empire, the former Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Airforce in Germany. Hewas Aide-de-camp to the Queen between 1983 and 86. The Corps of Commissionaires isa Windsor operation through and through. It won’t be a shock to learn, therefore, that theCorps is an umbrella organisation for hired killers. Some of the companies in its networkare Sandline Ltd, Executive Outcomes and Defence Systems Ltd. Like the Corps ofCommissionaires these are London-based and employ from the Special Air Services(SAS) and the military and police forces in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth.The Corps have a permanent office in Papua New Guinea and the government there wasvoted from office in 1994 for negotiating a contract with Sandline International to use itsmercenaries to put down a local insurgency. Sandline, in turn, subcontracted to DefenceSystems Ltd (DSL), which has private and government contracts in more than 40countries. It is employed by almost all the City of London cartels, the Club of the Isles,and has branches in Washington, Jacksonville, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bogata, Lima,Maputo, Kinshasa, Luanda, Port Moresby, Moscow, Kazakhstan, Jersey and Sarajevo.71Sandline was behind the coup in Sierra Leone which removed a legitimately electedgovernment shortly after they cancelled a $20 million a year contract with the company.72This also triggered the inquiry into illegal arms sales to Sierra Leone by British suppliersthrough the Sandline network. A debt of some $16 million owed to Sandline by SierraLeone before the coup, was paid by turning over diamond concessions to Executive"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"398Outcomes’ London underwriters Branch Energy.73 This firm is owned by TonyBuckingham of Sandline International and yet another former member of the SAS.74 Hehad pulled the same diamonds-for-mercenaries ‘arrangement’ on Angola and he floatedthese concessions on the Vancouver stock-market as a company called Diamond Works.75Another business partner of Tony Buckingham is David Steel, the former leader of theBritish Liberal Party and Anti-Apartheid Movement, and a member of the Queen’s PrivyCouncil.76 Steel’s Heritage Oil and Gas shares London offices with Branch Energy.77In Sarajevo and the former Yugoslavia it has been working in conjunction with theQueen’s agency, the Crown Agents. Defence Systems Ltd has substantial contracts withthe United Nations, the World Bank, BP Royal Dutch Shell, S. G. Warburg, CreditSuisse, Robert Fleming, Kleinwort Benson, British Airways, Cadbury Schweppes,Jardine Matheson, Rothmans, the Rothschilds, Exxon, Mobil, Amoco, Texaco,Chevron, Brown and Root, General Motors, Coca Cola, and Bechell.78 A directory ofthe Black Nobility if ever I saw one. Defence Systems Ltd was established in 1981,again the early years of the Thatcher regime, and its rise was meteoric thanks to itssupporters and patrons. At one point in 1980 it was a wholly-owned subsidiary ofHambros Bank.79 The first managing director of DSL was Alestair Morrison, Order ofthe British Empire, the former number two in the 22nd regiment of the SAS. The firstchairman was Major General Viscount Gilbert Monckton of Brenchley, Companion ofthe Bath, Order of the British Empire, and former chief of staff of the British Army ofthe Rhine. His father was in Winston Churchill’s cabinet and chairman of MidlandBank, and his son was editor of The Daily Telegraph (Hollinger) Sunday Magazine andadvisor to Margaret Thatcher. Philip Warner of the shipping company P & 0 wasanother founding director of Defence Systems and a later chief executive was RichardN. Bethell, another former SAS officer. His father, Lord Nicholas Bethell, was an agentwith British Intelligence (M16) and Lord-in-Waiting to the Queen. He was involved inthe manipulation of the war in Afghanistan through the 1980s and the terroristorganisations which have come from that. Defence Systems interlocks with a similarcompany, Control Risks, a very important part of the network founded in 1974 to serveLloyds of London.80 The managing director of Control Risks is Major Arish Turle,former SAS, and among its directors is General Sir John Stanier, former Commander inChief of UK land forces and Aide-de-Camp-General to the Queen. Lord Soames, thesenior Tory politician and son-in-law to Winston Churchill, is another Control Risksdirector. Soames was ‘advisor’ to Prince Charles at the time that Princess Diana gaveher outspoken interview with the BBC programme Panorama. Soames, (nicknamed‘fatty’), questioned her mental state. I’ve got a feeling she was rather more mentallystable than Soames, somehow. In that Panorama interview Diana spoke in a way thatno insider ever has about the Windsors. According to Stephen Dorrill in his book, TheSecret Conspiracy, Inside The Secret Service In The 90s, Control Risks is the mostimportant of the private secret services operated by the Queen’s Privy Council.81Defence Systems was bought by the American company Armor Holdings for $26million. Armor is a front company for the George Bush circle and the idea was to give"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"399Defence Systems an ‘American’ owner to allow expansion into the United Statessecurity market. Body Armor and Equipment Inc. was a small family-owned companyuntil it went bankrupt in 1992 and was reorganised as Armor Holdings by theintroduction of Wall Street investors and Windsor associates. One director, Richard C.Bartlett, is chairman and trustee of the Nature Conservancy of Texas which wasfounded by the British Privy Council in 1946. One of the companies using DefenceSystems in South America is British Petroleum who employ Control Risks. BP is one ofthe most unpleasant business operations on the planet and a front for the British ForeignOffice, British Intelligence and The Crown. British Petroleum is a jewel of theBrotherhood and the Windsor cartels and so it is only understandable that they woulduse the Brotherhood-Windsor ‘security’ network. The BP chairman, Sir David Simon,was invited to join the government of golden boy Tony Blair after he became PrimeMinister on May 1st 1997. Simon is also director of the Bank of England, GrandMetropolitan, Rio Tinto, Alliance AG, and a member of the International AdvisoryCouncil of the Deutche Bank.82 His role in the government is for ‘European affairs’ andthis is Blair-speak for ensuring that Britain becomes a member of the European singlecurrency and central bank and therefore loses all power to govern itself. Simon wasreplaced as head of BP by Peter D. Sutherland (Bil), a notorious Brotherhood front man.Another company I should mention with regard to the manipulation of Africa and theAmericas is Transparency International which is a member of the Crown AgentsFoundation and has the managing director of the Crown Agents on its own board.Transparency International is used to destabilise governments under the guise ofexposing corruption.83These interconnecting ‘security’ companies operating world-wide are the privatearmy of the Windsors and the Black Nobility based in the City of London. Want sometrouble in Africa to advance your Agenda. No problem. Where do you fancy, Rwanda?Algeria? The Congo? How about South America? Where do you fancy? Bolivia? Peru?These are part of the network being developed for a planned global coup some time inthe not too distant future. Confirmation that the Royal Family are close to theintelligence agencies and operate outside the ‘democratic’ process came in an interviewgiven by Colonel David Stirling, the founder of the SAS, who worked for PrincePhilip’s World Wide Fund for Nature in African covert operations. Before he died, hetold the authors of the book who Killed Diana ?,84 that in late 1974 or early 1975 heattended a dinner at a royal palace hosted by a senior member of the monarchy. PrincePhilip I would guess. Prince Charles’ uncle, Lord Mountbatten, was also there alongwith ten representatives of British Intelligence including the heads of MI5 and MI6.They were there in an unofficial capacity and Stirling pointed out that all militaryofficers swore allegiance to the Queen and regarded her as the ultimate authority, moreimportant than elected governments. The meeting was called to discuss the state of thecountry and the need for intervention in political affairs. The use of force was on theagenda, he said. Stirling told the meeting of his involvement in an operation to create acoup d’etat in Libya and at the time he was the leader of an organisation called GB75"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"400which was designed to take over public services in times of crisis. John Mitchell, thechairman of the shipping company Cunard, also confirmed that he had been approachedto take part in a coup because they wanted his ships. One of the orchestrators was SirBasil Smallpiece, financial advisor to the Queen. Mitchell said:“They asked me to take part in a coup. They said it would involve the army. They implied ithad the highest backing... I went out of there in a state of shock. “85Yet people still believe that the idea of secret groups manipulating from the shadowsis the nonsensical invention of the paranoid. In fact the evidence for this, and theWindsors’ involvement, is overwhelming. Do we really believe that this Windsor-Intelligence agency network which was planning an armed coup in Britain, would notconspire to kill Diana, Princess of Wales, when she threatened their power? Come on.What I have outlined in this chapter is a mere fraction of what there is to tell about theWindsors, the Black Nobility, fascist, reptilian family which operate from BuckinghamPalace, London, on behalf of the global network of the reptilian-Brotherhood. TheWindsors have been responsible, through their global networks, for the deaths of untoldmillions. As the Brotherhood-controlled police won’t be knocking on the door ofBuckingham Palace, it is the people who, in my view, need to impose so much pressureon the Windsors and the establishment that they have to abdicate. Then we can begin todismantle their source of power, the enormous structure headquartered in the City ofLondon.The Windsors in their present mode must know the game is up and they may beplanning to abdicate and move to the United States. It may even be part of theBrotherhood Agenda for them to abdicate soon, who knows? To the reptilians, theAgenda is far more important than any individual or family line, even theirs.SOURCES1Thomas Foster, Britain’s Royal Throne (Acadia Press, Victoria, Australia, 1986), p 2.2Samuel 10:24.3Britain’s Royal Throne, p 6.4Ibid, p 8.5Exodus 28:1-21.6Britain’s Royal Throne, p 12.7Ibid, p 14.8Psalm 89: 35-37."},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"4019The Curse Of Canaan, p 85.10In The Blood, p 62.11Gary Boyd Roberts, Ancestors Of The American Presidents, New England HistoricGenealogical Society.12Ibid.13The Top 13 Illuminati Bloodlines, p 99.14Ibid.15The information about Philip’s Nazi connections is available through many sources, but this anda catalogue of other information about the Windsors can be found in a series of articles pulledtogether in a document called “The True Story Behind the Fall of the House of Windsor”.

Of that I have no doubt.But please don’t take my word for this. Look at the evidence and judge for yourself.Many people dismiss the idea that Diana was assassinated because it would beimpossible to kill her in a public situation and then cover up the evidence. After all,there would need to be coordination between so many different agencies. Well that’sprecisely what happened in the United States with the assassination of President JohnFitzgerald Kennedy in 1963 and that was even more difficult to cover up. It wasn’tstaged as an accident which immediately creates the diversion of was it an accident orwas it murder? The Kennedy assassination was quite clearly murder. He literally hadhis brains blown out in front of hundreds of onlookers and it was captured on film byone of them, Abraham Zapruder. In .. And The Truth Shall Set You Free, I feature theKennedy killing in detail and you will see that the same people who supported orarranged the assassination were also appointed to the commission of the Chief‘Justice’ and 33rd degree Freemason, Earl Warren, to investigate what happened!Among the Warren Commission ‘team’ were Allen Dulles, the head of the CIA sackedby Kennedy, and the paedophile, rapist, Bohemian Grove member and pornographerGerald Ford, who would later become President of the United States after RichardNixon was removed by Watergate. When Representative Hale Boggs, the onlyCatholic on the Commission, began to question its findings, he died in a plane crash.How convenient.Jim Garrison, the New Orleans District Attorney, is the only man to chargeanyone with Kennedy’s murder. This was the CIA operative and former wartimefriend of Winston Churchill called Clay Shaw. Garrison failed to win a convictionagainst the guilty-as-hell Shaw because many of the key witnesses were murderedbefore the trial. Garrison was astonished at the way apparently unconnectedagencies, including the Dallas police, the FBI, the press, and the Washingtonestablishment, could work so obviously as one unit to carry out the assassination andthen cover it up. This was possible because of the networks I have been exposing inthis book which have their operatives, ‘gofers’ and yes men, in all the agenciesrepresenting all sides and shades of opinion. Getting on for 40 years after the murderof President Kennedy in a public street on a public occasion we are no nearer toanyone being convicted. As usual the ‘culprit’ was identified immediately by those"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"405who were really responsible and he was eliminated so he couldn’t contradict theofficial ‘tale’. For Lee Harvey Oswald in Dealey Plaza, Dallas in 1963, read Henri Paulin the Pont de L’Alma Tunnel, Paris in 1997. Once the scapegoat has been sacrificed,no other story is entertained by the authorities and public interest wanes with the weeks,months and years. It’s an old and well tried technique. A President is killed in a publicassassination; Lee Harvey Oswald, the scapegoat or ‘patsy’, is murdered in public a fewdays later; and those who orchestrated their demise go to their graves unexposed andunconvicted. The Princess of Wales could not be murdered in a staged accident and thewhole thing covered up? You’ve got to be kidding.As I’ve described the background to the Kennedy assassination in a previous book, Iwon’t repeat it all again here, but there are elements to that story that need to behighlighted and added to. Diana’s family, the Spencers, are of an Elite bloodline and soare the Kennedys, who come from the Kennedy clan of ancient Ireland and laterScotland. They are descendants of the Irish king, Brian Boru, also known as BrianCaeneddi, which later became O’Kennedy. They were the Lords of Ormond in what isnow called north Tipperary.1 From around 1600 a Scottish branch of the Kennedys canbe identified and this intermarried with the Irish line.2 The Scottish Kennedys became apowerful strand of the aristocratic bloodlines of Scotland and married into Scottishroyalty. One notable Kennedy was Archibald Kennedy, the 15th Earl of Cassillis, betterknown as the Marquess of Ailsa. He lived from 1872 to 1943 and held many leadingpositions in the Grand Lodge of Scottish Freemasonry including Grand Principle.3 Hewas a member of the key Holyrood House Lodge no 44 in Edinburgh which has closeties with the British royal family.4 In the 18th century, a Matthew Kennedy from Irelandwent to Paris to work with his good friend, the Illuminati frontman called Saint Germain,who presided over the Illuminati Lodge at Ermenonville near Paris.5 The lodge took partin blood rituals on an altar made from human bones.6 This Kennedy produced a workcalled A Chronological, Genealogical and Historical Dissertation of the Royal Family ofthe Stuarts who connect into the Merovingian line established in France. The JFK wingis related to the Fitzpatricks, a powerful Irish family with a coat of arms which includesthe classic Brotherhood symbols of three fleur-de4is, a dragon, and a lion.7 It seemslikely that the Fitzpatricks go back to France and the Holy Grail story.The family of JFK’s wife, Jackie Bouvier Kennedy (later Onassis), are related tothe Auchinclosses, one of the major Elite Scottish bloodlines, via the marriage ofJackie’s sister into the Auchincloss clan. Other Auchincloss bloodlines havemanifested as names like Bundy, Grosvenor, Vanderbilt, Winthrop and Rockefeller.8Hugh D. Auchincloss Sr married Emma Brewster Jennings, the daughter of Oliver B.Jennings, who co-founded Standard Oil with John D. Rockefeller. James ShelbyDownard describes Jackie Kennedy-Onassis, Caroline (Lee) Bouvier, and the writer,Gore Vidal, as the ‘stepchildren’ of Hugh D. Auchincloss.9 Vidal has described Johnand Jackie Kennedy as the “Sun God and Goddess”10 The Bouvier bloodline has beentraced back to Grenoble, France, where it is first mentioned in 1410 and Jackie’s great-great-grandfather, Eustache Bouvier, fought in a French regiment under the command"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"406of George Washington.11 It was noted earlier that the Kennedys also married into theDukes of Devonshire family at Chatsworth House, one of the leading Brotherhoodfamilies in England. The marriage of John Kennedy to Jackie Bouvier was anotherarranged marriage by the Eastern Establishment, the American bloodlines who run theUnited States according to the Agenda decided in the British Isles and France. Bothbloodlines connect with the key centres of London and Paris. The fact that theirmarriage and presidency was known as ‘Camelot’ with its King Arthur and Marsconnotations, is thoroughly appropriate because the King Arthur symbolism is used bythe Brotherhood as part of their secret language. The Kennedy family have been closelyinvolved with drugs, organised crime, the British monarchy, and the mind controlledslave operations like Project Monarch. This adds credibility to the claims by arecovered mind controlled slave I met who said she was taken to have sex with John F.Kennedy at the age of eleven - “Although they made me up to look about 16”.The Kennedy presidency was certainly not the way it was portrayed at the time.Kennedy had a stream of sexual partners and three of them, Marilyn Monroe, JayneMansfield and Zsa Zsa Gabor, were also girlfriends of Anton LaVey, head of the Churchof Satan. Jayne Mansfield was a high priestess. Other long term relationships includedtwo with members of Elite Scottish bloodlines, Lady Jean Campbell daughter of theDuke of Argyll, and Kay-Kay Hannon Auchincloss12 of the family to which his wifewas related. Behind JFK’s rise to fame was his father, Joseph Kennedy, a member of theBrotherhood’s Pilgrim Society. He was a crook with close connections to the Mafia andother organised crime. His fortune was assured when Winston Churchill awarded himthe franchise to import British liquor into the United States. Joseph Kennedy was anassociate of the Rothschilds and the Bronfmans, another ‘Jewish’ crime family inCanada which owns the liquor giant, Seagrams. Among Joseph Kennedy’s contacts inBritain when he was US Ambassador to the Court of St James’s in London were theAstors and the Rothschild bloodline offshoot, the Sassoons. Another intimate friend wasSir John Wheeler-Bennett, a leading executive of the Royal Institute of InternationalAffairs. Joseph Kennedy’s wife, Rose, came from the Black Nobility Fitzgerald family.The Fitzgeralds were one of the mighty Black Nobility clans of Italy which supportedWilliam the Conqueror’s conquest of England in 1066. This established Black Nobilityrule of the British Isles via ancient families like the St. Clairs/Sinclairs. So the ‘F’ inJFK was a Black Nobility family going back thousands of years. Rose’s father andJFK’s grandfather was John E (Honey Fitz) Fitzgerald, the vote-rigging mayor ofBoston. The Fitzgeralds lived in Hanover Street near the former site of the GreenDragon Tavern in Boston, home to the St Andrews Lodge which was heavily involvedin the manipulation of the American War of Independence and orchestrated the BostonTea Party.13Joseph Kennedy was a member of the Order of St John, the British version of theKnights of Malta, and the Bouvier family was intermarried with the Radziwills whoestablished the Knights of St John/Knights of Malta in Poland in 1610 and alsohelped to establish the order in the United States.14 The Kennedys support the"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"407Knights of Malta hospice movement in the United States via the Kennedy Institute forthe Study of Human Reproduction and Bioethics at the Jesuit-controlled GeorgetownUniversity. The hospice movement, while presented with a compassionate face, is afront to gather support for euthanasia. Most people involved with the hospicemovement are compassionate, it is the motivation of those who are manipulating it thatI am talking about. Once euthanasia is accepted in law, it opens the floodgates for thelegalised murder of what Kissinger calls the “useless eaters”. As has been welldocumented in the countless biographies of JFK, he endured a loveless childhood underthe iron rule of his father Joe and mother, Rose. He wasn’t even told that his brotherTeddy had been born and it was only when he came home from boarding school that herealised he had a new brother. There were no hugs, no show of affection, and theKennedy children were not allowed to show pain. His upbringing has all the classicsigns of the mind control techniques the Elite use on their own children. Prince Charleswent through exactly the same upbringing under his aggressive and deeply unpleasantfather, Prince Philip. JFK was groomed from an early age to take high office for theBrotherhood and he was supported by all the classic names like the Rothschilds, Tafts,Russells, Rockefellers, and media barons like Henry Luce, the head of Time-Life, andRandolph Hearst, the most powerful newspaper tycoon in the United States. WhenKennedy ran for political office, the Boston American newspaper, owned by Hearst,refused to accept the paid advertisements of his opponent.15But when JFK and his brother, Bobby, became President and Attorney General ofthe United States after their defeat of Richard Nixon in 1960, it seems that they beganto pursue policies and people that were far from conducive to the introduction of theirpaymasters agenda. This included withdrawal from the Vietnam War, the introductionof some interest-free money, an assault on organised crime (in public at least) and, asKennedy put it, a pledge to break up the CIA “Into a thousand pieces”. It doesn’tmatter who you are, if you don’t do as you are told, you are removed in the mostappropriate way, bloodline or not. The Agenda is far greater than any individual orfamily. I can’t help thinking, however, that there was more to the assassination thanthis and it has the feel of a long planned sacrificial murder, in accordance with theBrotherhood’s ancient ritual laws. The location of the assassination, Dallas, Texas isclose to the 33rd parallel of the 33rd degree of latitude. The top level of the ScottishRite of Freemasonry is the 32nd degree and the 33rd degree is only for those who havecontributed significantly to the Great Work, the takeover of Planet Earth. Dealey Plazais a mass of esoteric symbolism and is officially named after a 33rd degree Freemasoncalled George Bannerman Dealey, an early executive of the Dallas Morning News.Dealey means ‘goddess line’. Ley can also mean rule or law in Spanish, so translatingas ‘goddess-rule’. Either is perfect symbolism for the Brotherhood, especially thelatter. Dealey Plaza, the site of the first Freemason temple in Dallas, is shaped like apyramid with the capstone missing (see Figure 51 overleaf). The top is truncated by arailway bridge. The main pyramid is cut into two more by Main Street which runsdirectly through the centre. It is, in fact, three pyramids, two inside the one: the trinity"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"408or triad. Two energies interactingproduce a third. If anyone thinks this ismere coincidence they should do alittle research into the background ofthe Brotherhood secret societies at thetop levels and see the staggeringobsession they have with their symbolsand rituals. Kennedy was killed nearthe so-called grassy knoll on the rightof the pyramid and Lee Harvey Oswaldwas murdered while under police‘guard’ in an underground car park atthe bottom of the pyramid on HoustonStreet. Only a few yards separate thetwo points. The old Court Housenearby which looks into Dealey Plazais decorated with gargoyles. On top ofthe Court House is the symbo:of the ancient Order of the Dragon or the Snake. DealeyPlaza, to the secret societies, is a Sun temple.Kennedy was assassinated in an outdoor temple of the Sun by initiates of theBrotherhood network including the Knights Templar, the Knights of Malta, the Order ofSt John of Jerusalem, the Rosicrucians and the Freemasons. As James Shelby Downardwrites: “Masonry does not believe in murdering a man in just any old way and in theJFK assassination it went to incredible lengths and took great risks in order to make thisheinous act correspond to the ancient fertility oblation of the Killing of The King” 16Kennedy was shot just after noon when the Sun was “most high”. In ancient times itwas said that when the Sun was “most high”, he was doing his father’s work in thetemple (more symbolism used in the Jesus story). Kennedy was shot in the back, thehead, and the throat, and they are the same wounds suffered by the mythical HiramAbiff according to Freemasonic legend and initiation. Bill Cooper, a former operativewith US Naval Intelligence, believes that the mythical Freemason hero, Hiram Abiff, isreally a symbol for Jacques de Molay, the Grand Master of the Knights Templar whenthey were purged in France in 1307. De Molay was burnt to death on the Ile de la Cite,the original Paris, in the shadow of Notre Dame Cathedral, which the Templar’s hadbuilt on a former site of worship to the goddess Diana. His death was ordered by theRoman Church Inquisition with support from King Phillipe the Fair, who could wellhave been under the control of the Priory of Sion. Cooper says that the assassination ofJFK was the revenge of the Knights Templar against the Church, the state and thepeople. Kennedy is the only Roman Catholic President of the United States, the sameChurch of Rome which killed Jacques de Molay. On Dealey Plaza today, standing nearthe points where Kennedy and Oswald were murdered, is the obelisk erected by theFreemasons after the murders. The obelisk is symbolic of the penis of Osiris inFigure 51: The pyramid with the capstone missing. This isDealey Plaza where John F Kennedy was assassinated."},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"409Egyptian legend and the one in Dealey Plaza has the flame or lighted torch at the top(see picture section). The eternal flame on the Kennedy grave in Arlington Cemetery isthere for the same reason. The flame or lighted torch is the most obvious Brotherhoodsignature and on Kennedy’s grave the flame is within a circle, the ancient symbol of theSun. Kennedy was also laid in state in the centre of a circle under the dome on CapitolHill. There are 14 stones on the obelisk in Dealey Plaza, the number of pieces intowhich Osiris was cut by Set, according to Egyptian myth. The one part that his sister-wife, Isis, could not find was his penis, represented by the obelisk itself. She replacedthe penis of Osiris with one she made herself and this became the symbol of theBrotherhood. The Dealey Plaza obelisk was built for, and dedicated to, a Freemasoniclodge of the Scottish Rite. They have found stone phalluses in cathedrals and churcheshidden inside altars and when the investigation team of New Orleans District Attorney,Jim Garrison, searched the home of Clay Shaw they found penises.In this book I’ve exposed the secret language at its basic level, but the depth towhich it goes is astonishing. The science of numbers and names is one of these deeperlevels of communication and symbolism which only an advanced initiate or focusedresearcher would fully understand. Numbers and names are, once again, vibrationalfrequencies and the amazing synchronicity of these is due, I feel, to the law of what Icall vibrational attraction. Many of the number-name ‘coincidences’ will be consciouslymade to happen, but others are simply due to the energy field, the consciousness, of theperson or people attracting to themselves vibrational fields which synchronise with theenergy they are generating. This is how we create our own reality. Our inner self, ourvibrating consciousness field, attracts other ‘fields’ -people, places, ways of life,experiences - which sync with the energy we are generating. It’s a vibrational attractionbetween like energy fields. Therefore, our outer physical experience is merely areflection of what is happening inside. What we vibrationally project with our attitudesand emotions, we attract back to us in people, places, ways of life and experienceswhich vibrate to the frequency we are projecting or broadcasting. So when we changewhat is happening within us, we change our physical experience because one is areflection of the other. It is this ‘magnetic’ attraction of like vibration to like vibrationthat leads to people living in streets of a certain name or having relationships with thoseof a certain name, etc., because everything has its own vibrational code, includingsounds, numbers, words, colours and names. In ritual magic the correct sounds, words,incantations, and colours, are all used to manifest a desired energy field or vibratoryfield. Sound is especially important and this is why the Phoenicians were concernedmore with the sound of their words than their spelling. Mantras, the constant repeatingof the same phrase or sound, are part of this same knowledge. And, like all knowledge,they can be used for good or ill. The training of Japanese Samurai warriors includedinstruction in producing the fighting cry, “Kiai”. This sound is supposed to cause alowering of blood pressure and partial paralysis in the hearer. Thus we have a ‘blood-chilling’ cry. Low frequency sounds of three to five cycles a second can kill you. TheAmerican researcher, James Shelby Downard, has written of this science of sounds,"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"410numbers and names in relation to the Kennedy assassination. The writer, Robert AntonWilson, says in his book The Cosmic Trigger, that Downard’s theory is “The mostabsurd, the most incredible, the most ridiculous Illuminati theory of them all”. Thismakes me even more certain that Downard must definitely be on to something. My ownresearch supports this, too.Kennedy was killed on November 22nd 1963. This date was the anniversary of theorder or papal bull by Pope Clement V for the Knights Templar to be subjected totorture by the Dominican Inquisition. It was issued on November 22nd 1307. Novemberis also the 11th month and if you add that to 22, again you have 33. John and JackieKennedy left Fort Worth on the morning of November 22nd 1963 and the plane came toa stop at gate 28 at Love Field Airport in Dallas. The number 28 is assigned the name‘Beale’ in Solomonic cabalistic numerology. Beale is a word which derives in this way:Bel (El), Baal, Be al, Beal, Beale. These all relate to Sun gods. The 28th degree of theKnights Templar is the ‘King of the Sun degree’. JFK was born at 83 Beal Street,Brookline, Massachusetts, on May 29th 1917. The ‘protection’ of the President on thisfatal trip to Dallas was organised by the New Orleans CIA station which was housed ina Masonic temple building. Dallas is just ten miles south of the 33rd degree of latitudeand the founding lodge of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry was in Charleston, exactlyon the 33rd degree. The first atom bomb was exploded at the ‘Trinity’ Site on the 33rddegree of latitude. The Kennedy motorcade travelled down Elm Street once home to theBlue Front Tavern, the meeting place for Freemasons, and at 12.22 pm it arrived inDealey Plaza. Elm Street was known as ‘Bloody’ Elm Street because it was the scene ofcountless gun fights, stabbings and other acts of violence. The national offices ofTexaco Oil are on Elm Street. Close to Dealey Plaza is the Trinity River which used toflood the Plaza for many years until the introduction of flood defences. Into this openair temple of the ancient Brotherhood came Jackie Kennedy, representing the goddess,the Queen of Love and Beauty and her scapegoat Sun King, John E Kennedy. He wasthe sacrifice in the ancient ritual of the Killing of the Sun King: the ‘Ceannaideach’which is Gaelic for Wounded Head. Kennedy, of course, was shot in the head. I have itfrom a very good source that Kennedy didn’t die until the following spring. My sourceclaims that the ‘Kennedy’ who appeared in the post mortem photographs was J. D.Tippet, the police officer and Kennedy look-alike who was supposed to have been shotby Oswald with a gun that wasn’t working!When JFK was 22, a sculpture was made of him as a winged angel and it waspresented to the Vatican where it was used as part of a panel in which the angel hoversover St Therese as she writes in a book.17 After the assassination, Kennedy’s body wascode-named ‘Angel’ and the same name was used for the plane, Air Force 1, which flewhis coffin back to Washington.’8 Both Kennedy and Oswald were buried in places relatedto ‘Arlington’. Kennedy at the Arlington National Cemetery near Washington DC andOswald at the Rosehill Cemetery, near Arlington, Texas. Arlington is a word related toFreemasonic sorcery and pertains to necrophilia, a morbid attraction to corpses. Oswaldis Os or Oz, the Egyptian Sun god Osiris as in the Wizard of Oz. If you are looking at the"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"411synchronicity in the science of names and numbers, look at the astonishing coincidencesbetween the assassinations of JFK and Abraham Lincoln, who was also killed by theBrotherhood. Lincoln was elected to Congress in 1846 and Kennedy was elected toCongress in 1946. Lincoln was elected president in 1860 and Kennedy was electedpresident in 1960. Lincoln’s assassin, John Wilkes Booth, was born in 1839 and LeeHarvey Oswald, the alleged assassin of Kennedy, was born in 1939. Their successorswere both called Johnson. Andrew Johnson, who succeeded Lincoln, was born in 1808and Lyndon Johnson, who succeeded Kennedy, was born in 1908. Lincoln’s secretarywas called Kennedy and Kennedy’s secretary was called Lincoln. Both presidents weremurdered on a Friday in the presence of their wives and both were shot in the head.Kennedy’s vice-president, Lyndon Baines Johnson, had prior knowledge of theassassination and when he became president he immediately reversed all the policies onVietnam, interest-free money, and the CIA which Kennedy was implementing. TheBrotherhood Mother Goddess, Arizona Wilder, says she saw the shape-shifting Johnson atsacrifice rituals. Johnson’s middle name, Baines, comes from the related Scottish clans ofBain, Bayne, Beathy, Binnie, Beath and Beth. Freemasons from these clans claim thesame ancestor.19 The term, Mac, means ‘son of’ and so the son of Bain becomes MacBainand the interconnected clan, Beth, becomes MacBeth, the Scottish king made worldfamous by the writings of ‘William Shakespeare’. Bain in French means bath and this isan origin of the Order of the Bath title awarded by the British monarch. Purification orabsolution baths are given to the Masonic ‘Knights of the Bath’ before they cause murderand mayhem on the Brotherhood’s behalf. After her husband’s death, Jackie Kennedyjourneyed to the island of Delos in the Aegean Sea which is considered by legend to bethe birthplace of the goddess Diana and Apollo the Greek Sun god. Diana (the Moon) andApollo (the Sun) are often brought together in Brotherhood symbolism. Delos is alsoknown as the Island of the Dead because another version of the goddess Diana, known asHecate, is said to be the patroness of the ‘infernal arts’. Jackie went on to the Temple ofApollo at Delphi in Greece and in the ruins of a Greek theatre on that site she performedan ancient rite known as the Greeting of the Sun. She performed this, according to JamesShelby Downard, “With the expertise of an Aleister Crowley”.20 Another stop on her tourwas the island of Santorina with its reputation for vampires. The origin of the vampirestories are the blood drinking and blood sucking rituals of the Brotherhood and their‘energy sucking’ rituals, also. The vampire stories put the truth before our eyes in a waythat we think is only fiction. This is something the Brotherhood loves to do via its biggestvehicle for communication, Hollywood, a name which comes from the holly bush, theholly (holy) wood of the Druid magicians. Hollywood is called a place of magic. Exactlywhat it is. It’s playing with our minds, manipulating illusions.There are so many similarities between the Kennedy assassination, the ritual killingof a Sun King, and that of Diana, Princess of Wales, in what I am convinced to havebeen a ritual murder of the Moon goddess known to the ancients as Diana. It wasplanned that Kennedy would die on that spot at that time long before he becamepresident and so, I believe, Diana was groomed for at least many years to die in Paris at"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"412that spot at that time, also. It is quite possible that this was planned from theirchildhood, even birth. I know how extreme that sounds, but when you study theBrotherhood in depth you realise very quickly that they are not formulating their plansweeks or months in advance, but literally centuries. From the lower fourth dimensionthey have a very different perspective of time in this dimension than we do. In theconcluding chapters I will look in more detail at this and how and why such ritualassassinations are performed with such an eye to detail. Planning the murder of theRoman Catholic John Kennedy, the Sun King, to mark the anniversary of the RomanChurch’s Inquisition against the Knights Templar (or some other ritual) could quiteobviously have been agreed decades in advance and.the scapegoat decided andgroomed for office. In the same way, Diana’s birth to the bloodline family the Spencersin 1961 could have led to her being chosen as a symbol of the goddess Diana whowould be led to a ritual death in an ancient sacred place of Diana worship and sacrifice,the Pont de L’Alma tunnel in Paris. I think there is an excellent chance that this is whathappened. Just as Kennedy was manoeuvred into the presidency in 1960 for his ritualmurder in 1963, 50 Diana was manoeuvred and manipulated into a marriage with PrinceCharles and, finally, into the Pont de L’Alma tunnel. People say that to arrange themurder of Diana would have involved enormous planning and a great deal of time. Yes,that’s probably right. But they had plenty of time.Diana Frances Spencer was born at Park House on the Queen’s Sandringham estatein Norfolk on July 1st 1961, the third and youngest daughter of Viscount Althorp, laterthe 8th Earl Spencer, and his first wife Frances Roche. Her parents separated when shewas six and divorced in 1969, and her mother married the wallpaper tycoon PeterShand-Kidd. Diana had a younger brother, Charles, the present Earl Spencer, and twosisters, Jane and Sarah. Another son was born before Diana, but he died and shebelieved that her parents would much rather she been a boy, a son and heir. Diana saidthat her childhood was very unhappy and she was to crave all her short life for the loveand warmth denied her as a child. Living at Sandringham she knew the Queen from thetime she was a little girl and she used to play with the royal children. It is said thatCharles first saw Diana when she was still in her pram. She remembered, with less thanaffection, being shunted over to the Queen’s residence during the holidays year afteryear to watch the film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. The choice of movie is interestingbecause it was written by Ian Fleming, the intelligence agent, friend of Aleister Crowleyand author of the James Bond novels. The movie features a king and queen who hatechildren. They employ a child catcher to lure children, abduct them, and put them in acage. They are then taken to the castle and locked in a dungeon. It is all symbolism forwhat is actually happening and there is no way that the Windsors played this for Dianaso often by accident. Certainly Diana was already picking up the Windsor ‘vibes’ atSandringham. She told Andrew Morton in his book, Diana: Her True Story: “Theatmosphere was always very strange when we went there and I used to kick and fightanyone who tried to make us go” 21 So the Windsors were well aware of Diana fromthe moment she was born. When she was 13, Diana moved from Norfolk to live at"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"413Althorp in Northamptonshire, the Spencer family’s ancestral home, after her fatherinherited the title of Earl Spencer. Diana was particularly devastated when her fathermarried Raine, the daughter of the novelist Barbara Cartland. Diana had a deep loathingfor her. She said in Diana: Her True Story that in September 1989 she had unleashed heryears of frustration on Raine: “I told her what I thought about her, and I’ve never knownsuch anger in me. I remember really going for her gullet”. I said “If you only knew howmuch we all hated you for what you’ve done, you’ve ruined the house (Althorp), youspend all daddy’s money, and for what?” The empathy that Diana had with people inemotional distress came from her own emotional scars which she carried all her life.The Spencers are an Elite bloodline family. They are cousins of the Spencer-Churchills and related to the Marlborough family at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire,where Winston Churchill was born. Other forebears included the Duke of Marlborough,Sir Robert Walpole, and the Spencer family inherited a considerable fortune from Sarah,Duchess of Marlborough. They also married into the Cavendish family, the Dukes ofDevonshire at Chatsworth House, and that offshoot became known as Spencer-Cavendish. Diana shared common ancestors with Prince Charles in the 3rd Duke ofDevonshire and, most significantly, King James I, the first Stuart king of England andScotland and sponsor of Francis Bacon. It was King James who played a highlyinfluential role in the expansion of the Brotherhood, the formation of the VirginiaCompany which still controls the United States, and the creation of the King Jamesversion of the Bible. Diana was also descended through several lines from the Stuartkings, Charles II and James II, which connected her, as with James I, to theMerovingian bloodline in France. Charles II had so many children out of wedlock thatgoodness knows where some of their bloodlines are today. One thing’s for sure, theBrotherhood will know. As Elite families go, the Spencers are an important bloodlineand Diana was related to countless aristocratic lines, including the Earls of Lucan.Further afield the Spencers have blood ties with many leading American families andthey are distantly related to the Rockefellers. They have a long history of serving themonarch and the tradition continued with Diana’s father. He was equerry to KingGeorge VI (who was married to the Queen Mother) and to Queen Elizabeth. Diana’ssister, Jane, is married to Sir Robert Fellowes, the Queen’s Private Secretary at the timeof Diana’s death. Both of Diana’s grandmothers, the Countess Spencer and Ruth LadyFermoy, were inner circle members of the Queen Mother’s court, as were four of hergreat aunts. The Spencers and the Queen Mother were very close and it was LadyFermoy and the Queen Mother who manipulated Diana into her marriage with PrinceCharles. This could be most significant when you hear about the true nature of theQueen Mother.The countdown to the marriage began when Diana met Prince Charles at Althorpwhile he was having a relationship with her sister Sarah, in 1977. Diana was 16, but itwas three years later that the Windsors really made their move on her. With the QueenMother and Lady Fermoy manipulating behind the scenes, she was invited to a danceat Buckingham Palace to celebrate Charles’ 30th birthday. Then, in July 1980, a friend"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"414of Charles, Philip de Pass, asked her to stay with them while the Prince was there. InDiana’s own words, Charles was all over her and “He leapt on me practically”.22 Heasked her to travel with him to Buckingham Palace the next day and an invitationfollowed to join the Windsors in the September at Balmoral, their residence in Scotland.Eventually Charles asked her to marry him and she accepted. “I love you so much”Diana said to him. “Whatever love is” Charles replied.23 That is such a telling statementabout the Windsors and the way they bring up their children. They don’t understand lovebecause they give and receive so little. Imagine being a young child and having to lineup with everyone else to shake your mother’s hand when she returned from an overseasvisit. That is how the Queen and Prince Philip treated Charles. Diana was a kindergartennanny when the story of the relationship broke in the media and her life in the public eyeand the constant spotlight had begun. So had her nightmare with the Windsors. Lookingback, Diana could see that Charles had never been genuine in his affection for her. Sherealised even before the wedding that he was having a relationship with his real love,Camilla Parker-Bowles, and this continued and grew during their marriage. Charles andCamilla communicated using the code ‘Gladys and Fred’. Camilla, like the Windsors, isclose to the Rothschilds and on the first anniversary of Diana’s death, she was on thelonian island of Corfu enjoying the hospitality of Lord Jacob Rothschild.24 He has alsospent £16 million leasing and restoring the Spencer’s 18th century mansion overlookingGreen Park in London, close to Buckingham Palace.25The Windsors wanted Diana to produce heirs with Spencer genes and that was allshe was to them: an incubator. A week after her engagement to Charles, her bulimiabegan. This is an eating disorder in which you make yourself sick every time you eatfood. Diana was throwing up three or four times a day and became desperately thin. AsI mentioned in an earlier chapter, many victims of childhood sexual and Satanic abusesuffer from bulimia later in life. She said that the bulimia was ‘triggered’ when Charlesput his hand on her waist and said “Oh, a bit chubby here, aren’t we?” Bulimia is adisease of the emotions, as most diseases are, and Diana was in emotional turmoil evenbefore the wedding. She described the attitude of Charles like this:“He’d found the virgin, the sacrificial Iamb, and in a way he was obsessed with me. But itwas hot and cold, hot and cold. You never knew what mood it was going to be, up anddown, up and down... He was in awe of his mama, intimidated by his father, and I wasalways the third person in the room.”26She met her sisters and told them she couldn’t go through with the marriage,especially with Camilla still on the scene, but they said she had no choice because“Your face is on the tea towels and you’re too late to chicken out”. Before the wedding,Diana stayed at Clarence House, the London residence of the Queen Mother. When shehad arrived no-one was there to welcome her, she said, it was like going to a hotel.Diana and Charles were married in St Paul’s Cathedral on July 29th 1981. That morningat Clarence House she said she felt calm, deathly calm: “I felt I was a lamb to the"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"415slaughter. I knew it, and I couldn’t do anything about it”.27 What prophetic words thosewould prove to be. They spent the first night of their honeymoon at the Mountbattenfamily estate at Broadlands in Hampshire before sailing around the Greek islands in theroyal yacht Britannia (Barati). The bulimia got worse and she considered suicide, suchwas the scale of her unhappiness. “My husband made me feel so inadequate in everypossible way that each time I came up for air he pushed me down again. I hated myselfso much”. One of Diana’s royal duties in 1982 was to represent the Queen at the funeralof Princess Grace of Monaco, another victim of Brotherhood murder when the brakeson her car failed. Princess Grace, formerly the actress Grace Kelly, ran the Monacobranch of the Order of the Solar Temple with Jean Louis Marsan, the close friend of herhusband, Prince Rainier. The Windsors got what they wanted when Prince William wasconceived. Diana was told that the birth had to be induced to fit in with Charles’ poloplaying programme and the blond-haired, blue-eyed William was born on June 21st1982, the summer solstice. Now first of all, what kind of father and husband insists thathis wife and son be given needless drugs to suit his polo diary? And secondly, doesanyone believe that was really the reason? The Windsors are obsessed with astrology andthe esoteric arts to such an extent that the psychic-astrologer mother of an Irish friend ofmine could predict with uncanny accuracy the colours the Queen and Queen Motherwould be wearing every day. She was correct again and again because she knew thecolours connected to each day according to esoteric law. A family so steeped inSatanism, the esoteric mysteries, and the Sun cult, induce the heir to ensure he is born onthe summer solstice, when the Sun is at the peak of its power, and that’s just acoincidence? No way. He was christened William (after the Black Nobility William theConqueror) Arthur (after the Sun God symbol, King Arthur) Philip (after the Duke ofEdinburgh) Louis (after Louis Mountbatten). William’s first serious girlfriend, accordingto the British press, was Emma Parker-Bowles, the niece of his father’s lover, Camilla.Prince Harry was born in September 1984 and Diana’s usefulness to the Windsors wasover. “Then suddenly as Harry was born it just went bang, our marriage, the whole thingwent down the drain”, she told Andrew Morton.28 Diana and Charles separated in 1992and divorced on August 28th 1996. Almost exactly a year later she was dead.Diana lived in apartments at Kensington Palace or ‘KP’ as she called it. PrinceMichael of Kent, the Grand Master of English Freemasonry, has his home there, also.The Brotherhood-Windsor machine attempted to destroy Diana’s credibility and publicesteem. A tape of an intimate telephone conversation between her and the car dealer,James Gilbey, was released through the media in 1992. On the tape Diana said thatCharles was a real torture. She told Gilbey: “I’ll go out and conquer the world, do mybit in the way I know how and leave him behind”.But despite, perhaps because of, the efforts to discredit her, Diana’s popularitycontinued and grew. Her unique combination of a big heart, a global public profile, andan intense desire to settle a score with the Windsors, threatened the very survival ofroyalty. Her natural compassion and empathy with people were putting the emotionlessWindsors in the shade and exposing them as out of date and irrelevant. The naive, shy"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"41619-year-old, who was enticed into the Windsor web, was now a woman who wasrealising her true power and was prepared to use it. She took the issue of landminesfrom obscurity to the front pages across the world and she had the platform to do thatwith any subject she chose. To the Windsors and the Brotherhood, this lady wasdangerous with a capital D. She also knew many intimate secrets of the Windsorsand the establishment. She knew where the bodies were buried as they say, and shehad shown in her famous interview with the BBC current affairs programme,Panorama, in November 1995, that she was prepared to reveal some of them. Thatinterview, in which she talked of her unhappy relationship with the royal family invery forthright terms, did immense harm to the Windsors and they must havewondered what on earth she would do next. In my travels around the world I met aman who had a call from Diana in March 1997, a few months before she died. Hewas amazed when she said it was the Princess of Wales and he didn’t believe her atfirst, especially when she said that she was calling from a ‘supermarket phone’ inEngland. But Diana and this man had a mutual friend, and a close confidant of Dianatold me that she often rang people from public phones, particularly from adepartment store in Kensingston, when she wanted to be certain the conversationwould not be tapped. Diana admired this man for his wisdom and knowledge. Shesaid she had something to reveal that would shake the world and she wanted hisadvice on how best to do it. He will not reveal what she told him, but when I saidthat I knew she was aware of the Windsors’ connection to global drugs trafficking, hesaid: “Oh no, it was much worse than that”. You might get an idea of what it couldhave been later in this chapter. Diana knew far more than people realise, as we shallalso see. But that was only one level of the plot to kill Diana. At the highest level ofthe black magicians who control the Brotherhood networks, I have no doubt that herdeath had long been planned according to their ancient and deeply sick ritual. Thesetwo levels, the practical need to remove her (lower initiates) and the need for a ritualkilling of the ‘goddess Diana’ (highest initiates) would run side by side, exactly asthey did with President Kennedy.The final sequence of events which led to her death involves, at almost every turn, aman called Mohamed Al Fayed, the Egyptian ‘owner’ of Harrods, the top people’s storein Knightsbridge, London, and the father of Dodi Fayed who died in the crash withDiana. Al Fayed also owns the Ritz Hotel in Paris. This is the guy who bleats on and onabout the need for “truth” and “justice” over the death of Diana and yet he would notrecognise truth if it bit him on the bum. You can always tell when Mohamed Al Fayed islying - his lips are moving. He fought a long, public, and vicious battle for control ofHarrods and the House of Fraser with Tiny Rowland, the head of another Brotherhoodfront, Lonrho, the London-Rhodesia company, which has been responsible for so muchmanipulation of Africa and Africans. At one stage there was a Department of Trade andIndustry inquiry into the Harrods takeover and it concluded: “The lies of MohamedFayed and his success in ‘gagging’ the press created a new fact: that lies were the truthand the truth was a lie”.29 This would be a suitable epitaph for what Private Eye, the"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"417British satirical magazine and others, have dubbed: The phony pharaoh. The report alsorevealed that Al Fayed had lied about his family background. He had claimed to comefrom a wealthy Egyptian family and it was this money, he said, that he was using to buyHarrods. In fact he comes from a far from rich family and he didn’t have any suchmoney of his own. He was born on January 27th 1929 in Alexandria, the son of aschool inspector. He sold Coca-Cola in the streets and later knocked on doors sellingSinger sewing machines. It was an introduction to Adnan Khashoggi, now the world’smost famous arms broker, which changed his life. Khashoggi was the son of thepersonal physician to the King of Saudi Arabia and the Khashoggis employed ‘Al’Fayed (then Mohamed Abdel Moneim Fayed) in their business ventures. He later fellout with the Khashoggi family, apparently, and proceeded to lie his way through astream of business deals which made him a lot of money from setting up deals forothers and taking a commission. The construction company, Costain, was one of hismain sources of income in the early days, but he made nothing like as much money ashe claimed to be worth. See Tom Bower’s book, Fayed, The Unathorised Biography,for the detailed background.30 Al Fayed’s involvement with the Haiti dictator, PapaDoc, led to interest in his activities by the CIA. One CIA report on him remarked that:“He strikes one as being friendly and evil at the same time”.31While he became wealthy by the standards of the rest of the population, he did nothave nearly enough of his own money to buy Harrods and he used the wealth of theSultan of Brunei, one of the richest men in the world. It was the Sultan who providedthe money for Harrods and Al Fayed also acted for him in the purchase of theprestigious London hotels, the Savoy and the Dorchester. Al Fayed may act the bigtycoon, but in the biggest game he is a ‘gofer’ who takes orders and does as he’s told.This is fascinating because we are led to believe that Mohamed Al Fayed and the Queenare on different sides and oppose each other over what happened to Diana. Funny, then,that Mohamed Al Fayed is subordinate to the Sultan of Brunei and the Queen ofEngland is a friend of the Sultan of Brunei. She went to stay with him betweenSeptember 16th and 20th in 1998.32 What is going on here? Al Fayed’s most prominentsycophantic media poodle is the Daily Mirror which has acted as his personalnewsletter. The Mirror made strenuous efforts to secure an interview with me in June1998, despite my initial reluctance. But when I made my thoughts about Al Fayedknown to the reporter, the article was dropped by the Editor, Piers Morgan, whopersonally conducts the Mirror interviews with Al Fayed.Doing as you are told by the very rich and powerful and using highly unscrupulousbusiness methods, has proved extremely profitable for Al Fayed. He owns a fleet ofbullet proof Mercedes, a £3.5 million Sikorski helicopter, a £13 million GulfstreamJet, a £15 million yacht, The Jonikal, castles and 50,000 acres in Scotland, andexpensive homes in Gstaad, New York, Dubai, Geneva, Gerona, London, Surrey andLos Angeles, all fully staffed and equipped.33 Balnagown, his Scottish castle, is closeto Loch Ness. As long as he does as he is told and is useful to the Brotherhood hiswealth will continue. If he doesn’t - gone. They will hang him out to dry. Another"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"418source of income for the Fayeds, again interconnected with the Sultan of Brunei, isarms dealing. Al Fayed’s former brother-in-law and Dodi’s uncle, Adnan Khashoggi,the infamous Saudi arms dealer and fixer, has arranged weapons sales, legal and illegal,worth multibillions of dollars. Many of the discussions for such deals take place at theRitz Hotel in Paris owned by Mohamed Al Fayed (or the Sultan?). This is one reasonwhy Al Fayed has the Ritz bugged to eavesdrop on his VIP guests. In fact, he haseverything bugged, as we’ll see. He is deeply involved in brokering arms sales andDodi was often an unofficial broker for arms-for-oil deals between the Gulf states andAmerica.34 Adnan Khashoggi is a close associate of George Bush and bankrolled part ofBush’s ‘Iran-Contra’ arms-for-drugs operation in the 1980s. George Bush, in turn, is abosom buddy of the Queen and Prince Philip. Al Fayed is involved in manyunderground deals and plots involving events, people, and subjects that he is desperateto ensure remain secret. Certainly not a man to trust under any circumstances, in myview. I should emphasise, too, that the Islamic elite, like the Sultan of Brunei, aresignificant players in the Brotherhood pyramid and the Grand Lodge at Cairo is one ofthe most powerful secret society centres in the world. This is hardly surprising given theBrotherhood’s obsession with ancient Egypt and it’s ritual and symbols. The reptilianbloodlines may be predominantly Aryan, but they are far from exclusively so. Theywork through streams within all races, the Arabs and the ‘Jews’ most certainly amongthem. One of the predominant secret societies in the Arab world is the Order of theMystic Shrine or the ‘Shriners’. They are connected to the Knights Templar, and theYork and Scottish Rites of Freemasonry. Among their members in the United Stateshave been President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his successor President Harry S.Trueman. There is also a Prince Hall Shrine for black members of the Brotherhood,including that self-styled spokesman for the black community in the United States,Jesse Jackson.Al Fayed has served the interests of the Brotherhood and the establishment in anumber of ways while presenting an anti-establishment public profile. For instance itwas he who exposed the two Conservative MPs, Neil Hamilton and Tim Smith, whowere taking money to ask certain questions in the House of Commons. This is quiteillegal. Al Fayed knew that this was true because he was the one giving them themoney! This story did enormous harm to the Conservative Government and did muchto help the Brotherhood chosen one, Tony Blair, to a landslide victory for the LabourParty at the following General Election. Al Fayed has also escaped prosecution so farfor a growing number of allegations from young female members of staff at Harrodsthat he sexually assaulted them. His obsession with sex is legendary. One girl, 17-year-old Samantha-Jane Ramsay, said that when she complained to her supervisor that shehad been groped by Al Fayed, the supervisor sighed: “Another one”. Al Fayed sackedher for making the complaint, as he does all those who speak out against his sexualmolestation and style of business ‘management’. John Monks the general secretary ofthe Trades Union Congress, said that at Harrods there was “A regime of fear andterror”. When Samantha-Jane took her complaint to the local Marylebone Police"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"419Station, she said that the officer told her: “You’re not the first to come to us. We havefiles inches high on Mr Al Fayed, but no proof. It would be your word against his”.35 Afile inches high of different girls making the same complaint about the same manwould, I suggest, constitute rather more than “No proof”. But Al Fayed, the man we aretold the establishment would love to crush, survives untouched. So this is just some ofthe background to the liar, double-dealer, sexual molester, Satanist and Sultan of Bruneifrontman, who had complete control of Diana’s security in the days and hours leadingup to her death. I wouldn’t trust him with the security of my cat. Indeed, as Tom Bowerhas documented, Al Fayed has ordered his hit men to shoot a cat he didn’t like.Al Fayed had become close to the Spencer family through Diana’s father, Earl‘Johnny’ Spencer, and stepmother Raine. He helped ‘Johnny’ through financialdifficulties and said he considered the Earl to be a brother.36 He had given Raine, whomDiana couldn’t stand, a place on the Harrods board. Al Fayed sponsored prestigiousroyal events like the Royal Windsor Horse Show and polo competitions, but heespecially backed the causes and charities supported by Diana. Bob Loftus, the head ofsecurity at Harrods between 1987 and 1996, told the British Channel Four programme,Dispatches, in June 1998, that he was ordered to tell Al Fayed immediately if Dianacame into the store. Al Fayed would then go to the department where she was shoppingand ‘accidentally’ meet her. Every Christmas a green Harrods van would call at Diana’shome, Kensington Palace, with gifts for her and the boys from ‘Uncle Mohamed’.When you look at the evidence, he made it his business to court the friendship of thePrincess of Wales in every way possible. On June 3rd 1997, he invited her to join himfor a Summer holiday at his beach-side villa in San Tropez in the south of France. OnJune 11th he got the breakthrough he had been working so hard for: she accepted. Thefollowing day he completed the purchase of a £15 million yacht, The Jonikal, throughhis Bermudan company Mohafa Shipping, and it was on this boat that Dodi and Diana’sromance was soon to blossom.On July 11th Diana arrived in San Tropez with her sons, William and Harry, to stayin an eight-bedroomed luxury apartment on the ten acre Al Fayed estate on theexclusive Le Parc development. At this time, Dodi Fayed was still at his apartment inParis with his fiancee Kelly Fisher, the American model. The 41-year-old Dodi was a‘gofer’ for his father and lived on his father’s wealth, although he had enjoyed somesuccess in the movie industry at one time as the hands-off producer of the hit Britishfilm Chariots Of Fire, again thanks to his father’s money. He had a playboy reputationand was a very big spender, once famously running up a $100,000 bill in two monthson his Amex card. He was dominated by his father and even in his film operation everydecision had to be approved by Al Fayed. Dodi did whatever his father told him to do.He had been engaged to Kelly Fisher for eight months and she was expecting to spendher holiday on The Jonikal. But on the evening of July 14th, Dodi took a phone callfrom his father who ordered him to go immediately to San Tropez to be with Diana.Kelly Fisher described what happened next in an interview with the Dispatchesprogramme:"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"420“(Dodi) said he was going to London and he’d be back and then we were going to SanTropez. That evening he didn’t call me and I finally got him on his portable phone. I said‘Dodi where are you?’ and he said he was in London. I said ‘OK, I’ll call you right back atyour apartment’. He said ‘No, no, don’t call me back.’ So I said ‘Dodi where are you?’ andhe admitted he was in the South of France. His father had asked him to come down andnot bring me, I know now.”Two days later Dodi sent a private plane to fly Kelly to San Tropez. But while hestayed with Diana, Kelly was kept aboard another Fayed boat. “I’m sitting here stuck”she said. “So he had me in my little boat cage and he was, I know now, seducingDiana.” On July 31st, Diana returned to San Tropez for a second holiday with Dodi, thistime alone. Kelly Fisher was back in Los Angeles preparing for her wedding to Dodiwhich she said was due to take place on August 9th. But two days before that, the storybroke in the world media of the romance between Dodi and Diana. Kelly heard from afriend who saw a picture in the paper. She recalls:“I started calling him in London because at this time I was expecting his arrival in a day. Icalled his private line, but there was no answer. So then I called the secretary and asked tospeak to him and she wouldn’t put me on. So Mohamed got on and in so many horriblewords told me to never call back again. I said ‘He’s my fiancee, what are you talkingabout?’ He hung up on me and I called back and the secretary said don’t ever call hereagain, your calls are no longer to be put through. It was so horrible.”37Ironically, Diana used to have Kensington Palace swept for listening devices and nowshe was in the clutches of a man for whom bugging was an obsession. The Al Fayed villain San Tropez was bugged, as were all Fayed properties. Everything Diana said could beheard. Bob Loftus, the former Head of Security at Harrods, said that the bugging there was“A very extensive operation” and was also always under the direction of Al Fayed.38 HenryPorter, the London Editor of the magazine Vanity Fair, had spent two years investigating AlFayed and he said they came across his almost obsessive use of eavesdropping devices totape telephone calls, bug rooms, and film people. Through mutual friends, Porter warnedDiana about Al Fayed’s background and activities “Because we thought this was quitedangerous for her for obvious reasons”39 But Diana apparently felt she could handle it andalthough she knew Al Fayed could “Sometimes be a rogue”, he was no threat to her, shethought. He is rather more than a rogue and rather more often than ‘sometimes’. Sheapparently told friends: “I know he’s naughty, but that’s all”. The Dispatches programmesaid they had written evidence that Al Fayed bugged the Ritz Hotel and given hisbackground and the deals that are hatched at the Ritz, it would be staggering if he did not.Kelly Fisher said that the whole time she was in Fayed property she just assumedeverything was bugged. It was known, she said, and Dodi had told her everywhere wasbugged. She went on: “As a matter of fact, when I confronted him about Diana, he said:‘I can’t talk to you on the phone’. He said ‘I’ll talk to you in LA’. I knew what that"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"421meant”. Diana was under the ‘protection’ of the Al Fayed security machine and evenher most private conversations were being monitored.Diana went with Dodi to Al Fayed’s Elizabethan-style mansion called Barrow GreenCourt at Oxted in Surrey, formerly owned by the Satanist Lord McAlpine. Throughoutthe house Al Fayed had placed statues of semi-naked Greek goddesses. On August 21st,despite Henry Porter’s warning, Diana returned again to San Tropez for another holidaywith Dodi. Al Fayed was milking the situation, briefing journalists and photographersand enlisting the advice of publicist Max Clifford.40 The Al Fayed machine was leakingthe couple’s whereabouts to ensure maximum publicity. Al Fayed complained after thecrash that photographers and journalists would not leave the Princess alone, a statementwhich, in the circumstances, beggars belief. The Diana-Dodi romance was now in fullswing and Al Fayed was urging his son to intensify the relationship.41 And what AlFayed said, Dodi did. Nothing was left to chance. Diana’s favourite music, the themefrom The English Patient, was played over and over as the couple cruised on TheJonikal. Diana and Dodi had much in common. Both had been born into wealthyfamilies and their fathers were distant figures. Both had experienced the breakdown oftheir parents’ marriages as their mothers left home. They even attended finishingschools close to each other in Switzerland. But we should not rule out the possibility ofmind manipulation techniques being used on both parties. I have met a number offormer mind controlled slaves who were programmed to fall madly in love withsomeone they normally would not even like and there are endless examples of ‘lovespells’ concocted by black magicians to cause someone to fall madly in love with them.My scientist friend, Brian Desborough, tells me that the feeling of being in love isdependent upon the brain producing phenylethylamine. This is a chemical which alsodiminishes the ability to discriminate effectively, hence the term ‘love is blind’.Production of this chemical is sustained by the release of endorphins, a naturallyoccurring chemical linked to memory, learning, pain suppression, sex drive andhormone regulation. If these chemicals could be stimulated in both parties they wouldfall instantly in love.I think there is a very good chance that something like this happened as the sting wasset up for both of them. There was talk of engagement in the air, but it is impossible to sayhow imminent that was, because reports conflict. I have great doubts about that myself.Diana and Dodi left the South of France from Olbia Airport at 1.3Opm on August 30thbound for Paris on Al Fayed’s Gulfstream jet. They apparently intended to stay one nightat Dodi’s apartment, which looks out on the Arc de Triomphe, before going on to Londonwhere Diana was due to meet her sons. It was to be her last full day alive. The planetouched down at Le Bourget Airport in Paris at 3.2Opm and they were met by 20 or socelebrity photographers known as the paparazzi (from an Italian word meaning ‘buzzinginsects’). A Mercedes was waiting for the party and a green Range Rover was to follow onbehind. This is normal security procedure and the very minimum you would expect toprotect someone so globally famous. With Diana and Dodi in the Mercedes was Dodi’sbodyguard, Trevor Rees-Jones, the 29-year-old former member of the elite British"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"422military regiment, the Paras or Parachute Regiment. Along with the SAS, the Paras arethe most highly trained (and therefore mind controlled) regiment in the British forces. Inthe Range Rover were the driver, Henri Paul, the acting Head of Security at the Ritz, andanother bodyguard, Kes Wingfield. They drove from the airport to the Villa Windsor onthe Bois de Boulogne, the former home of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. The Dukeand Duchess lived there after the duke, as King Edward VIII, abdicated the Britishthrone when the government and establishment would not accept his marriage to theAmerica divorcee, Wallis Simpson. They then moved to Paris as the Duke and Duchessof Windsor. Their house is now owned by Mohamed Al Fayed and it is said that he wasgoing to give it to Dodi and Diana as a wedding present. This talk of a wedding,however, is unsubstantiated, much as Al Fayed has sought to promote it. His publicitymachine led the public to believe the couple had spent time at Villa Windsor discussingdecor, but the bodyguard Kes Wingfield said that they only stayed there for “Around tenminutes”.42 From here they were driven to the Ritz Hotel where they arrived at 4.20pm.The Ritz is in the Place Vendome and all around that square at first floor level aresymbols of the Sun and the cross, very much like the symbols used by the ancients tosymbolise the ‘journey’ of the Sun through the year which I featured earlier in the book.This was the symbol of King Louis XIV, who was known as the ‘Sun King’. At hispalace at Versailles in the 17th century he decorated rooms in honour of Apollo, the Sungod, and Diana, the goddess of the Moon. There was also a statue of the goddess Dianaat Versailles. In the centre of the Vendome Square is an immense pillar with a statue ofNapoleon on the top and it mirrors the famous Nelson’s Column in Trafalgar Square,London. At this stage Diana still had the same level of security that she’d had since theairport, but this could have been increased considerably if support from the FrenchHigh Protection Police Security Service (SPHP) had been requested. It is there toprotect VIPs visiting the city, but a request for their services must be made. It wasn’t.All Diana’s security was provided by Al Fayed’s people from start to finish. If they hadenlisted the protection of the French police, Diana would still be alive. When a celebritylike Madonna visits Paris, the French Police have one car in front of hers and anotherbehind, together with two motorcycle riders front and back of the motorcade. The carsare driven by trained drivers and they carry armed security men. According to reports,the SPHP made three, possibly four, offers to protect Diana, but each one was refusedby Dodi. Was he, himself, under instruction to reject these offers from someone towhom he could not say no? An officer of the SPHP told Dodi: “If you will not use ourcar, we recommend that two police cars accompany you on your excursions around thecity.”43 This advice, too, was ignored.Diana and Dodi went straight to the $6,000 a night 18th century Imperial Suite at theRitz. From there, Diana rang her friend, the Daily Mail journalist Richard Kay. She toldhim she intended to retire from public life in November and he said that he had neverheard her so happy. The couple booked a table at the Chez Benoit restaurant for 8.45pmand they intended to spend the night at Dodi’s apartment. At 6.3Opm Dodi went acrossthe Place Vendome to a jewellers, Repossi, to buy a diamond ring for Diana which was"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"423later delivered to the Ritz. A little after 7 pm, the couple were driven in the Mercedesalong the Champs Elysees to Dodi’s apartment on Rue Arsene-Houssaye close to theArc de Triomphe. Here they unpacked and prepared for dinner. Again the back upRange Rover was there and so was another car carrying bodyguards for addedprotection. Why was this level of security thought necessary in the early evening, butnot in the early hours of the morning at the time of the crash? Dodi’s apartment isknown as the ‘Etoile flat’ after the Place de L’Etoile, the ‘Sun or star circle’ road aroundthe Arc de Triomphe. The route they took to the apartment was out of the PlaceVendome onto the Rue de Rivoli, and half way around the Place de la Concorde theyturned right onto the Champs Elysees and drove straight up that famous avenue toDodi’s apartment (see Figure 52). Remember that route, it is crucially important. Asthey arrived at the apartment at 7.1 5pm, bodyguards were seen to rush from their car tohold back six paparazzi. Diana and Dodi became concerned about eating at theunprotected Chez Benoit restaurant and decided to head back to the Ritz to eat. Theytook the same route back, down the Champs Elysees and around the Place de laConcorde. The couple, with bodyguards Wingfield and Rees-Jones, walked into the Ritz,captured by the now famous video pictures, at 9.47pm. As the paparazzi gather innumbers outside, amid rumours of an engagement announcement, Diana has alreadystarted the last three hours of her life. Who was feeding the rumours and the whereaboutsof Diana during the day to create the paparazzi stampede that dominated Diana andDodi’s movements and decisions that night? I think I can guess, somehow. Al Fayed.Figure 52: The journey to Dodi’s apartment in the early evening of August 30th. A straightforward journey withno need to go through the Pont de L’Alma tunnel."},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"424And who were some of these ‘paparazzi’ making life uncomfortable for Diana, thuschanging the plans for the evening? The Ritz security video also identified a number ofpeople who had been outside among the onlookers for most of the day and were stillthere on the edge of the crowd.44Now the plot seriously thickens. After speaking on the phone with his father at hisestate in Oxted, Surrey, Dodi Fayed announced a quite ludicrous plan. To avoid thepaparazzi, the Mercedes which had been transporting them all day together with theback up Range Rover were to be taken around the front of the hotel and used as a decoyfor the paparazzi. At the same time another Mercedes would be brought around to theback entrance of the hotel to whisk the couple away to the apartment on the ChampsElysees. Henri Paul, the 41-year-old acting head of security at the Ritz, was called onhis mobile phone by Dodi and told to report back to the hotel. He went off duty at 7pmand by the time he returned it was 10pm. No-one has established where Paul was inthose three hours. Dodi said that his father, Mohamed Al Fayed, had personallyauthorised that Henri Paul should drive the Mercedes. For me, that is Dodi-speak for“My father told me this is how it is going to be”. Henri Paul was not a qualifiedchauffeur and had no hire car permit. L. Fletcher Prouty, a former colonel in the USAirforce who worked closely with the intelligence agencies, once said:“No-one has to direct an assassination - it happens. The active role is played secretly bypermitting it to happen. This is the greatest single clue. Who has the power to call off orreduce the usual security precautions?”45Absolutely right. If we apply Prouty’s rule to Diana and ask who had the power -and used that power - to reduce the usual security precautions for her that night, wehave a rather interesting answer: Mohamed Al Fayed. Given these circumstances hemust answer the obvious question: Why was this security reduced? When PresidentKennedy was assassinated, there were no bodyguards standing on his car while fourwere standing on the one immediately behind (see picture section). He was also in anopen-topped car at a dangerous time in a dangerous city. When Martin Luther Kingwas shot dead at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee, on April 4th, 1968, theblack police officer in charge of security for King was sent home against his will hoursbefore the shooting. The only two black firemen at the station next to the motel weresent to other stations just for that day. The scapegoat for this assassination was a guycalled James Earl Ray. Not even King’s family believed he was responsible. So muchso that they attended his funeral a few years ago. When Bobby Kennedy wasmurdered after making a speech at the Ambassadors Hotel in Los Angeles on June 4th1968, again the security arrangements were tampered with. The plan was forKennedy to walk off the stage and through the crowd to the exit. But immediatelyafter the speech, Kennedy’s ‘aides’, especially Frank Mankiewicz, insisted that it wassafer for him to go out through the hotel kitchen. When he walked into the kitchen hewas met by the mind controlled Sirhan Sirhan with a gun in his hand. It is far more"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"425likely that Bobby Kennedy was actually shot by members of his ‘security’ team,particularly Thane Eugene Caesar, the ‘security guard’ who was employed at the lastminute and had endless connections into far right groups and the intelligencecommunity. But with Sirhan Sirhan at the scene with a gun, they had a mind controlledscapegoat to take the rap and that was all they needed. Sirhan Sirhan had been on a‘mind expansion’ course with the Rosicrucians in the weeks before he was implicated inKennedy’s death (see .. .And The Truth Shall Set You Free). Frank Mankiewicz, whoguided Kennedy to the kitchen, was a former public relations man for the Mossad-frontin America, the Anti Defamation League. He turned up later as head of publicity for theOliver Stone film, JFK, which claimed to be an expose of the assassination of PresidentKennedy. It wasn’t. When the Israeli Prime Minister, Zitzhak Rabin, was shot dead byan assassin in Tel Aviv in 1995, an extraordinary video taken by an onlooker showedhow Rabin’s security detail stepped back in unison to leave the assassin alone and freeto kill his target. You can see the pattern. And what happened in the crucial last minutesof Diana’s life? They withdrew her security on the orders of Mohamed Al Fayed via hisson. That is a fact. All day she had travelled in the same Mercedes with the RangeRover as a back up vehicle. Now she would transfer to another Mercedes with no backup support whatsoever. This was an extraordinary decision for a man obsessed with hisown security. Bob Loftus, the former Head of Security at Harrods, said:“Compared with the protection that Al Fayed affords himself, which is very professional, ofa very high standard, that which was afforded to the mother of the future King of Englandwas a Mickey Mouse operation.”46He added that “Al Fayed was absolutely paranoid about his personal protection”.Just for him to walk around his own store, there would be three or four plain clothesmembers of his personal protection team who travelled with him all the time, plusanother four uniformed security who would act almost as ‘outriders’ to create two ringsof security around him. That’s in his own store! But is it paranoia, or the knowledge ofthe seedy, cesspit, world of arms dealers and Brotherhood fixers of many kinds, inwhich Al Fayed constantly operates? People who think nothing of the mass murder ofchildren, let alone the assassination of a wealthy ‘yes’ man like him. Dodi Fayed wasobsessed with his security for the same reason. A lot of this security was also inspiredby the size of Al Fayed’s ego, to be fair. Mostly he recruited his body guards from theSAS and the Parachute Regiment and used the Brotherhood operation, Control Risks, tomake recommendations. Tom Bower tells in his book about Al Fayed of how armedguards at the Oxted estate hide behind bushes wearing full combat uniform and blackedout faces. Whenever Al Fayed travelled in his Mercedes there was always a back upRange Rover carrying emergency medical equipment and security staff, but now hewithdrew that protection from Diana. More than that, a new car was introduced for her,another Mercedes was sent to the rear entrance of the Ritz, supplied by a car hirecompany called Etoile Limousines, the same name as Dodi’s flat. Etoile Limousines is"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"426based at the Ritz and depends for its entire income on contracts with the hotel and itsguests. In other words, it is controlled completely by Mohamed Al Fayed and whoevercontrols him. The new Mercedes was an S-280, lighter in weight than the 600 seriesthey had used all day and without the dark tinted windows. Other cars were available,but this one was chosen instead. A director of Etoile, Niels Siegel, told the inquiry intoDiana’s death that he delivered the car to the rear entrance of the Ritz, but theDispatches programme showed that this is a lie. It was delivered by a driver calledFrederic Lucard and he can be seen doing so on the security video. Lucard said hefound it very strange that Etoile would allow Henri Paul, a man not qualified as achauffeur, to drive one of their cars. So why did they do it? Because Mohamed AlFayed told them to, that’s why. Brian Dodd, the former Head of Security for Al Fayedin the 1980s, gave his assessment of the situation to Dispatches:“It’s a new car that’s come into the system. They wouldn’t have had time to check that carout. It should have been checked out. There could have been a bomb on the car, forinstance. It was a most stupid plan. It shouldn’t even have been considered. The back upvehicle is there, not just to avert the paparazzi, but for instance, a motor cyclist with apillion rider to pull up and shoot, or put a magnetised bomb on top of the car. That’s whythe back up car is there - to stop any of that. Why they never had a back up car, God onlyknows. (I think I can offer a good guess without the need for Divine inspiration.)“I had probably six or eight men I would consider professional bodyguards who I wouldhave had on that job and Trevor Rees-Jones and Kes Wingfield, after what I have seenhappened, would not have been in Paris that night.”The Mercedes with Henry Paul at the wheel sped off from the rear entrance of theRitz at 12.20am with Paul telling the paparazzi not to bother following because theywould never catch him. Diana and Dodi were in the back seat and in the front was TrevorRees-Jones, the former ‘Para’ with the reputation for being ‘fearless’. Rees-Jones says hedisagreed with the change of plan. He was not wearing a seat belt which is normalpractice because body guards need to be free to react quickly. The car was driven atspeed down the Rue Cambon and turned right down the Rue de Rivoli into the Place dela Concorde where it stopped briefly at the lights. The paparazzi photographer, RomualdRat, on the back of a motor cycle, drew up alongside them here, but he says that HenriPaul jumped the lights on red and headed onto the dual carriageway alongside the RiverSeine called the Cours la Reine. The car plunged down into one tunnel, came back to thesurface, and almost immediately went down into the very short tunnel at the Pont deUAlma. Here it went out of control and struck the 13th pillar in the centre of the tunnelwhich is lined with concrete pillars unprotected by crash barriers. Henri Paul and DodiFayed died immediately According to the autopsy report Diana was clinically deadwithin 20 minutes and this was long before she arrived at hospital. Trevor Rees-Jonessurvived the crash because he was wearing a seat belt and Diana and Dodi were not. This"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"427could be highly significant. Rees-Jones was not wearing a belt when they left the Ritzin accordance with normal practice for body guards, and when Romuald Rat took aphotograph at the lights at the Place de la Concorde, Rees-Jones still did not have a seatbelt on. But little more than a minute later when the car struck the pillar, he waswearing a seat belt. Why? If he donned the belt because for some reason he senseddanger, why did he not scream at Diana and Dodi to put their seat belts on? After all itonly takes a second and the whole reason he was in the car was to protect them. Rees-Jones has some serious questions to answer here and he is giving no answers. Somebodyguards do put a seat belt on when the car is on a fast road, but Rees-Jones is notsaying this. He says he doesn’t know why he strapped himself in. And if they weregoing to Dodi’s flat, they would have been on the fast road for about a minute. All hesays is that he remembers they were followed by two cars, one of them white, and amotorcycle, which is in keeping with the smokescreen story. But one simple fact aboutthe crash has been missed by all the newspaper articles, magazine features, televisiondocumentaries and discussions I have seen, and by all but a few researchers. Everyoneis agreed that the couple were being driven back to Dodi’s flat near the Arc deTriomphe when the crash happened. Well there is one glaring problem with that:The Pont de L’Alma tunnel is not on the way to Dodi’s flat.It takes you away from that area.I have been to Paris and walked the route the car took that night, in fact I have walkedextensively around that whole area, and the route to Dodi’s apartment is the same as theone they took earlier that night. You go to the Place de la Concorde and, half way around,you turn right into the Champs Elysees and drive straight up to Dodi’s flat on the right nearthe Arc de Triomphe (see Figure 53 overleaf). At that time of night it would take only afew minutes. But Henri Paul did not do that. He drove past the turning for the ChampsElysees, jumped the lights on red and sped down the duel carriageway to the Pont deL’Alma. This took them AWAY from Dodi’s flat. I have heard it said that Paul was going along way round to avoid the photographers and traffic, but the photographers would havebeen waiting at the flat anyway by the time they got there. What is most important to stresshere is that Henri Paul’s route was not the direct one to Dodi’s apartment, but it did ensurethat it took them through the Pont de UAlma Tunnel, the significance of which is fantastic,as you will soon appreciate. Interestingly, it was after Paul went past the turning to LesChamps Elysees and headed towards the Pont de L’Alma that Rees-Jones put his seat belton. He says he can’t remember why, but I can help him there. There can only be tworeasons for this. Either he knew what was coming or he realised when Henri Paul screamedoff from the lights that something was seriously wrong and he put the seat belt on toprotect himself. But again if that is the case, why did he not tell Dodi and Diana to do thesame? And if Rees-Jones had realised a potential danger, why had Dodi and Diana not seenit and taken the appropriate action to protect themselves? I’m sorry if that upsets Rees-Jones’ family, but given the circumstances these are questions that need to be asked."},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"428Once the deed was done; the scapegoat was produced. The methods are sopredictable, but they keep working so why change them? The Lee Harvey Oswald,Sirhan Sirhan and James Earl Ray of the Diana assassination was the driver, HenriPaul. Once the paparazzi card had been played and focused public and mediaattention in the days after the crash, it was announced that Paul was three to fourtimes over the French drink driving limit and that his blood contained traces of anti-depressant drugs, including Fluoxetine, the active ingredient of the infamous Prozac.“The cause of the crash was simple,” we were told. “The driver was drunk.”Tampering with blood samples or creating alcohol in the blood is child’s play and sois the insertion of tiny ‘balloons’ which release alcohol into the blood stream instages. There was certainly no sign before he drove away from the Ritz that he wasintoxicated to the extent, according to his blood tests, that he must have drunk theequivalent of eight Scotches on an empty stomach. A behavioural psychologist onthe Independent Television documentary, Diana - Secrets Of The Crash, could findno evidence that he was drunk after studying the Ritz videos of him that night, butthere could be an explanation for this which I will come to shortly. Only two daysearlier, Paul had undergone a rigorous medical for the renewal of his pilot’s licenceand there was no sign of the alcohol abuse the post-crash propaganda claimed. Quitethe opposite. And there was another strange anomaly revealed by the ITVdocumentary in 1998. The Haemoglobin in Henri Paul’s blood was found to containFigure 53: The change of route which cost Diana her life. Instead of going directly to Dodi’s apartment, HenriPaul sped off in another direction away from their destination. It is said that he was taking the long way round toavoid the paparazzi, but what an amazing ‘coincidence’ that this took the car into the Pont de L ‘Alma tunnel, oneof the Babylonian Brotherhood’s most sacred sites for the goddess Diana!"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"42920.7% carbon monoxide and this would have been at a much higher level earlierbecause the carbon monoxide content halves every four to five hours once exposure toit has stopped. Haemoglobin carries the oxygen. Debbie Davis of the Carbon MonoxideSupport Group said that with these levels in his blood, Henri Paul would not haveknown his left hand from his right, because of the reduced oxygen reaching the brain.Dr Alastair Hay, an expert on carbon monoxide poisoning, agreed and could not explainwhy Paul showed no signs of the considerable symptoms that should have been evident:“I find it difficult to rational ise everything. A blood-carbon monoxide level of 20% and (ahigh blood-alcohol level) suggests this would be someone with a much slower reactiontime, certainly be someone who would be slowed up in the way he did things, wouldprobably also be somebody who was in some pain, but none of those things appear to beevident from the pictures that we see of him. It is a bit of an enigma.”47There is a lot more to know about Henri Paul. His best friend, Claude Garrec, toldthe ITV documentary that Paul had contacts within the French and foreign intelligenceservices and maintained them throughout his time at the Ritz. This is no surprisebecause the intelligence agencies recruit the security men at the top hotels and the Ritz,with its VIP clientele and reputation for espionage and arms dealing, would have been aprime target. Paul certainly had unexplained sources of income. He earned about £20-25,000 a year at the Ritz and yet he was a keen pilot with 605 hours of flying time atabout £300 an hour. He had a string of bank accounts. There were two in a bank outsideParis and three accounts, plus a safe deposit box, at the Banque Nationale de Paris nearthe Ritz. He had three accounts at the nearby branch of Barclays and one current andfour deposit accounts at the Caisse D’Epargne de Paris. In the eight months before thecrash, sums of £4,000 were paid into an account here on five separate occasions. Intotal he had £122,000 (1.2 million francs) and no-one knows where it came from. Thenthere is the question of where Paul was in the three hours between 7pm when he wentoff duty and 10pm when Dodi called him on his mobile phone and told him to return tothe Ritz. His whereabouts in this period are a mystery. A very significant one.To understand how the Brotherhood operates requires immensely detailed researchover a vast array of interconnecting subjects. Everything from ancient history, toSatanic symbolism and ritual, the Earth’s magnetic grid, the power of the Sun, thebanking system, and mind control. The journalists who have produced the articles anddocumentaries about the crash came to the subject cold and they can never uncoverthe truth because they don’t understand what they are dealing with. Their vision ofpossibility is limited by their indoctrinated view of reality. They can’t see, forinstance, that there are organisations within organisations which means that one forcecan work through apparently unconnected agencies like British and FrenchIntelligence, the Paris police and medical services, and the inquiry investigating thecause of the crash. I mean, you don’t have to search far for evidence of that. Look atthe Kennedy assassination for one. It is this lack of research of the big picture that"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"430leads reporters like Martyn Gregory on the Dispatches programme to state categoricallythat “there is not a shred of credible evidence to support the conspiracy theory” and thatthe suggestion of Prince Philip’s involvement was “ludicrous”. I wonder after reading theevidence so far -and there is a great deal more to come - which you think is moreludicrous: the idea of a plot to kill Diana or Martyn Gregory’s statement? It was anunfortunate comment in a programme that produced some good information about AlFayed. Then there was the ‘investigation’ into the crash by John Stalker, the formerdeputy chief constable of Greater Manchester, in the News Of The World newspaper, inwhich he dismissed all idea that Diana was murdered. Ironically, Stalker claimed, quiterightly, that he was the victim of a conspiracy to remove him from the police force afterhe identified a policy by the Northern Ireland police, the RUC, to shoot people theybelieved were terrorists and ask the questions later. This was the so-called shoot-to-killpolicy. Pushing aside every suggestion of a conspiracy to kill Diana, Stalker asked: “Whywould the French want to cover up the murder of an English woman?”48 The naivety ofthat statement is so breathtaking, I need a glass of water. At the same time, Stalker did asksome pertinent questions about the crash and its aftermath: “Why was the Fayed securityaround the princess reduced to one wholly inadequate man with no back up? Why did thepolice not appeal for help from the public? Why was there no post mortem-autopsy onDodi Fayed’s body?” Answers: because of the very conspiracy you dismiss, Mr Stalker.One of the most important subjects to research if we are to understand how Dianawas killed, is the power and potential of mind control. I’ll give some examples. In the1980s the best part of 30 scientists working in top secret projects, mostly computerprogrammers, died in very strange and unexplained circumstances. Marconi was themajor company involved, but there were others like Plessey and British Aerospace. In1986, Vimal Dajibhai, who was working for Marconi Underwater Systems, drove fromLondon to Bristol, a city with which he had no connection, and threw himself off thefamous suspension bridge there. A few months before, Arshad Sharif, a computerprogrammer with Marconi Defence Systems, also drove from London to Bristol andhanged himself. Why Bristol? It is a former Knights Templar port and its name hasevolved from Barati, the Phoenician goddess. It just so happens that an elite unit ofBritish Intelligence called the Committee of 26 is based there and they use the runwayat the British Aerospace complex to fly British and foreign agents in and out of thecountry. I was called once, from what sounded like a plane, by a guy claiming torepresent the CIA. He said he was flying into the British Aerospace runway to sort meout. “The Company (CIA) are not happy,” he said. Oh, I thought, I am sorry, I do hopethey cheer up soon. I drove over to meet him just to check it out, but he didn’t show. Hewas probably a guy who needed help, or perhaps they were seeing how I would react tothreats. Either way, they got the airport right. In that period in the 1980s, not only inBristol, there were strange deaths galore of people at the cutting edge of development inthe ‘defence’ industries.What possesses a man to get into his car, drive more than two hours to the BristolSuspension Bridge, and jump off? This may seem a long way from the Diana"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"431assassination, but it’s not. I’m talking about mind control. A CIA scientist told me thathe was put through forms of mind control to stop him recalling his knowledge once aproject was completed. I’ll give you an example of mind control in a situation verysimilar to the one in Paris. David Sands was a highly skilled scientist working in a verysensitive area of defence, but at 37 he was talking about leaving the industry andchanging his lifestyle. He was happily married with two small children, a son aged sixand a three year old daughter. Sands and his wife had just returned from an enjoyableholiday in Venice when he died in mysterious circumstances. Although they are not somysterious if you understand mind control. He worked for Easams who, in turn, wereoperating contracts for the Ministry of Defence. It appears that while Sands and his wifewere in Venice, the company was visited by members of the elite British police unit, theSpecial Branch. Then, on Saturday, March 28th 1987, David Sands told his wife he wasgoing out to refuel the car, but he didn’t return for six hours. No-one has any idea wherehe was, but I think I do. His wife, Anna, called the police and constable John Hiscockwas at the house when Sands returned at 10.2Opm. Asked the obvious question:“Where have you been?”, he said that he had been driving and thinking. His wife saidthat it was out of character for him to be away for so long and she didn’t think herealised how long he had been out. He seemed confused, but happy, she said. Two dayslater, on Monday, March 30th, he climbed into his excellently maintained AustinMaestro and began his regular journey from his home in Itchen Abbas, near Winchester,to Easams at Camberley in Surrey. His wife said there was nothing unusual about hisdemeanour or behaviour and driving conditions were good. But about 30 minutes intothe journey when David Sands was driving along the A33 at Popham, near Basingstoke,he suddenly did a U-turn across the duel carriageway and headed at high speed in theopposite direction to his destination. Turning onto a slip road at about 80 miles an hour,Sands then drove his car straight into a disused cafe building killing himself in anexplosion of flame. There were no skid marks. He had not even tried to stop.49 It is soclear that during the time he was missing, his mind was being programmed and all ittook was a trigger word, sign, sound or action, and the programming was activated. Atthat point he would have switched from his normal self to a man focused only ondriving into the cafe building and blowing himself away. The subconsciousprogramming overpowers the conscious mind and robot replaces human.That, I am convinced, is what also happened to Henri Paul in Paris. Sands wentmissing for six hours before he drove into the cafe. Paul went missing for three hoursbefore he drove into the 13th pillar in the Pont de UAlma tunnel. This is what Isuggest happened in Paris. The Brotherhood networks were working through manypeople and agencies to ensure that Diana was in Paris that night because, at itsfoundation, the plan was to perform a specific Satanic ritual and the timing,circumstances and the place of death had to be arranged in intricate detail. Diana wasunder Al Fayed’s security web for much of the time leading up to the crash and all ofthe time in those last few days. Her conversations were heard and monitoredthroughout by the Al Fayed bugging system. During his missing hours, Henri Paul,"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"432the asset of French and British Intelligence, was being programmed for his role, orperhaps the final touches were being put to programming already installed. Diana’sritual death was arranged from the very top of the Brotherhood and, by comparison,people like Al Fayed are small and powerless nonentities, pawns in the game theyprobably do not fully understand. The Mercedes which was brought to the rear entranceof the Ritz had been stolen some weeks earlier - before the Diana-Dodi relationshipbegan - and when it was recovered it underwent extensive repairs. It had been standingoutside the exclusive Taillevent restaurant when the driver’s door was flung open andthe chauffeur pulled out by three Arabic-speaking men with hand guns. The vehicle wasmissing for two weeks and when it was found the wheels were missing, the door rippedoff, and the electronic system and equipment controlling the braking system had gone.Al Fayed, as we have seen, controlled the company, Etoile Limousines, which suppliedthe vehicle. No wonder the French authorities turned down the offer by experts fromMercedes to examine the car after the crash.When Henri Paul came back on duty that night he seemed his normal self to mostobservers. The programming was deep within his psyche still waiting to be activated.He may well have had a couple of alcoholic drinks in the Ritz bar, but his intake anddemeanour did not correspond with the later medical report. Claims that he was analcoholic also do not match with the examination of his liver. But if, as I suggest, HenriPaul was a mind controlled ‘multiple’ he could have been drunk in one compartment ofhis mind and not in another. I have heard from recovering ‘multiples’ who haveexperienced this. Someone close to Paul that night, his handler, was switching hiscompartments. In this way he could have had a considerable level of alcohol in hisblood while, in some compartments, he would have been unaffected by it. The samewith the carbon monoxide. Just before or just after the Mercedes pulled away from theRitz, Henri Paul was given the trigger which activated the programming. It could havebeen a sound, a sign, a colour or more likely a word or sentence. With Paul’ssubconscious programming now overwhelming his conscious mind, he sped away tothe Place de la Concorde and down the dual carriageway to the Pont de UAlma. Rees-Jones put his seat belt on, but apparently did not alert Diana and Dodi to the danger.Thus they stay unbelted. As Paul entered the Pont d L’Alma tunnel at an estimated 80miles an hour (some reports say slower), he braked fiercely, scraped the right hand wallof the tunnel, and then aimed the car at the 13th pillar. It is the 13th pillar that gives itaway. The Brotherhood throughout history has had such an obsession with the number13 that to believe this was a coincidence is taking chance to the level of fantasy. Theremust be 30 pillars in that tunnel and the car hit the 13th because it was meant to. Dianahad an aversion to the number 13 and she would not allow a 13th lot in her dressauction at Christies the June before she died. If, as some witnesses have suggested, thecrash was caused by the Mercedes hitting a white Fiat Uno or by a motorcyclist flashinga powerful light into Paul’s eyes from a motor cycle, there is no way he could be sure ofhitting the 13th pillar. But a person with a deeply programmed subconscious would beable to put the car right on the button, even at speed."},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"433Mark Phillips is the man who helped to deprogramme Cathy O’Brien when she wasa mind controlled slave of the CIA. He has worked in these fields for much of his adultlife and after I reached my conclusions about the events in Paris, I rang him to ask if itwould be possible to mind control Henri Paul to pick out that pillar at speed. Mark wasin no doubt: “Yes, Yes” he said “More than yes, absolutely yes”. He pointed out that thesubconscious worked much faster than the conscious mind and to the subconscious 80miles an hour would actually be quite slow compared with its ability to think and react.If the speed was considerably slower as some reports suggest, it would have been eveneasier. “There are many techniques they could have used to programme his mind duringthose three hours he was missing”, Mark said. The number of ways they could havecaused the crash, another vehicle, an explosive device, stun weapons, etc, etc, would filla book and any of them is possible on the face of it. But not if they wanted to be sure ofhitting the 13th pillar, which they did. To do that, they needed a driver with aprogrammed subconscious.I think the stories about the mysterious Fiat Uno and the motorcyclist with the flashinglight are diversions to lead researchers away from the simple truth. So much time andeffort has been wasted on the Fiat in particular, fueled by Al Fayed’s own investigationteam. Whenever such assassinations are staged, there are always a stream of false ‘clues’and ‘leads’ which divert attention. The Kennedy assassination was full of them. Anotherpossibility for the cause of the crash is external control of the car. Randulph Fiennes,famous for his polar expeditions, was an officer in the Royal Scots Greys and attached tothe elite SAS. He wrote a book about a secret group of assassins called the Clinic and howthey murdered people while making it look like an accident. The death of Major MichaelMarman is particularly relevant to what could have happened in Paris. He was driving aCitroen 2CV along the A303 near Stonehenge in November 1986 when a BMW comingthe other way careered across the carriageway and killed him instantly. Fiennes says thatthe BMW had been tampered with and the braking system was operated by remote controlwhich could override the normal system via compressed air from a tiny scuba divingcylinder hidden in the engine compartment. The remote control equipment was operatedfrom a Volvo which followed the BMW, Fiennes reported. The BMW was driven by SirPeter Horsley, a retired Air Marshall, who survived the crash. Fiennes says that the Clinicknew that Horsley would be travelling along that road at the same time as their target. Inhis autobiography, Sounds From Another Room, Horsley says that he was accelerating toabout 60 miles an hour when the car began to react strangely. He saw a grey Volvo closingup quickly behind him and as he was about to wave it past, his BMW spun sharply to theleft, the brakes screeching, and then sharply to the right and back again. This isremarkably similar to what happened to the Mercedes before it struck the 13th pillar.Horsley was by now desperately trying to maintain control and he went on:“Out of the corner of my eye I saw the grey Volvo accelerating past me at high speed. Mycar had now developed a mind of its own as it swung broadside and skidded down theroad. With a lurch it hit the central reservation, mounted the grass verge separating the two"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"434lanes of the highway and crossed over into the opposite carriageway. I had just time to seea small car approaching from the opposite direction. I hit it sideways on with tremendousforce. In a split-second the driver’s horror-stricken face was visible and I heard his hoarsescream.”50It is possible that Diana’s Mercedes was externally controlled in this way, because itis clear that the steering on Horsley’s BMW was also remotely controlled. Certainly ahighly skilled operator could direct the Mercedes into the 13th pillar. Support for thecontention that no other car was directly involved in Diana’s crash comes from EricPetel who claims to have seen the crash. Petel says that he was riding his motorcycletowards the entrance to the tunnel when he was overtaken by the Mercedes. No othervehicle was nearby. He said:“I saw a car in my rear-view mirrors flashing its headlamps. I moved across to let it by andit raced past even though I was doing about 70 miles per hour. An instant later I heard adeafening noise and saw the accident. The car was spinning in the road... I stopped. Therewere no other cars or bikes around at all and I could see all the way through the tunnel.The roof of the Mercedes was totally smashed in. The right hand rear door was partly openand I looked in and saw a woman. She seemed to have been thrown forward from theback seat and had her head between the front seats.”51Petel said blood was flowing from her right ear and as he brushed her hair from herface and placed her head on the arm rest, he realised it was Princess Diana. Hereyelashes were fluttering, but she had not opened her eyes at this stage, he said. Petelestimates he was at the scene for about a minute before climbing back on his bike toring the police. He told them that Diana had been in an accident, but they laughed andtold him to stop wasting their time. In despair at this, he rode to the police station inAvenue Mozart. His lawyer, Antoine Deguines, says that Petel was kept waiting for 25minutes and taken into a backroom where he was handcuffed. For reporting an‘accident’? When eventually freed, he was told to follow a police car to another policestation where he gave a statement which he signed without reading. “I was outraged” hesaid “They didn’t seem to care about the crash.” He heard nothing from the authoritiesfor months before he enlisted help from a lawyer to tell his story to the official inquiry.Whenever an assassination occurs in a public place, two things happen. The personnamed as responsible is a ‘patsy’ or ‘scapegoat’, most often these days under mindcontrol, and diversions galore are created to lead investigators away from the truth ofwhat happened. The first method allows you to make an immediate arrest, or expose theperson to blame, and no further investigations are necessary because everyone knows whowas responsible. We have seen this technique with Lee Harvey Oswald, Sirhan Sirhan,Timothy McVeigh, and now Henri Paul. It is endless. The second method, the diversion,ensures that the crucial hours and days after the event are wasted as people chase a massof false stories and ‘leads’ .This was a technique used in Paris with the paparazzi, the"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"435flashing lights from motorcycles and later the Fiat Uno. Also when people are fed aconstant barrage of conflicting reports and theories they become confused and aconfused mind switches off and loses interest. So first they tell you the paparazzi wereto blame, then they were not. Then they tell you the car speedometer was found stuck at120 miles an hour, then they say it was found on zero.I thought it strange how many American witnesses to the crash were quickly located.The Pont and Place de L’Alma were not, before Diana’s death, a popular tourist area.There is nothing there except a restaurant or two, a tunnel, and a maze of crossing roads.And yet at 12.25 in the morning, several American tourists say they witnessed whathappened. The number of witnesses in general was unusual anyway, given the late hourand the fact that Paris empties at that time of year as vast numbers of Parisians take theirannual holiday to the French coastal resorts. I can understand that some people in thefew cars travelling along the road at the time may have seen the crash and its immediateaftermath, but I know from visiting the spot myself, that the main pedestrian routes havevirtually no view of the tunnel at all. The police failed to control the crash sceneaccording to normal police procedure and so much evidence was lost immediately. Theyfailed to question important witnesses and leaked some information while maintainingunshakable secrecy over other areas of the investigation.52 It all stinks.Today there is an added challenge for would-be assassins and assassination plotswith the ‘traffic’ cameras that are located all over cities. Smile, you’re on TV. It wouldbe impossible to keep secret the methods and personnel used to kill Diana if the wholething was being videoed. But when you are the Brotherhood with connections at thehighest levels in politics, police and intelligence agencies, the traffic cameras present nosuch problem. You simply switch them off! There are 17 traffic cameras on the routebetween the Ritz and the Pont de L’Alma, including those inside the tunnel itself. Ifthey had been working that night there would be no mystery, because you could playback the whole event on your television set. One camera looks down on the entrance tothe tunnel and would have recorded any Fiat Uno or men on motorbikes with flashinglights. But that camera, like all the others, was switched off at the crucial moment.Never before in Paris had the whole system malfunctioned at the same time and thepolice refuse to explain what happened. The system runs on an independent powersupply and it is controlled by the police and, ultimately, by the French Intelligenceagencies, because the cameras are there to monitor far more than just traffic problems.At the same time as the camera system failed all the police communication frequenciesin central Paris also went off. Simon Reagan in his excellent book, who Killed Diana?,quotes a contact called Andre’ who, like many people, loves to listen in to police radiomessages. Andre’ was sitting on a bench near the Eiffel Tower, a few minutes walk fromthe Pont de L’Alma, on the night Diana died. He was, as usual, using a receiver tomonitor the police communications. But suddenly, at 12.2Oam, all the lines went down.There was a radio blackout. It lasted for 20 minutes and then, Andre’ said, the signalcame back and there was a mass of radio traffic as people all wanted to talk at once. “Ihave never... come across such chaotic radio traffic”, he said. “It was extraordinary.”"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"436When the lines went down Diana was leaving the Ritz on her last journey alive. By thetime they came back she was lying in the tunnel under the complete control of theemergency team and according to the autopsy report within a few minutes of clinicaldeath. And there is not a shred of credible evidence for a conspiracy, is there, eh? MyGod, it’s in our face. But within ten days of the crash, the French police had produced a350 page preliminary report which assumed it was an accident and they did notconsider any other possibility.Now, talking of that ‘emergency team’ brings me to another vital point. As a contacton the fringes of British Intelligence told me, causing the crash is easy for the powersinvolved, but you cannot be sure of killing your target. Therefore you have your peoplecontrolling the medical team because, although your target hasn’t died, there is now acredible reason for them to die. There has been a crash. The medical team’s job (or thosein charge, anyway) is to make sure that the target does not survive, no matter whatcondition they may be in to start with. Even those who dismiss the idea that Diana wasmurdered have questioned the astonishing delay in getting her to hospital when,according to the official medical reports, she was suffering from an injury that requiredurgent surgery. The doctors say that the pulmonary vein had been ruptured near the heartand this was filling her lungs with blood. Diana was lying in the tunnel bleeding todeath, if that is correct. The only way her life was going to be saved with such an injurywas through immediate surgery. So why was it more than an hour and a half before shearrived at the hospital? Within a minute of impact, Doctor Frederic Mailliez with anAmerican ‘friend’ Mark Butt, drove into the tunnel from the opposite direction. A privateinvestigator I know has made extensive inquiries into Mailliez and Butt and, while theseinvestigations continue, his findings strongly suggest there is more to both of them thanwe are being told. The crash happened at 12.25am and by 12.26, Doctor Mailliez said hehad seen the crushed Mercedes, stopped his car, turned on warning lights, run across tothe Mercedes to establish there were two people dead and two alive and had rung theemergency services. This man must be a seriously quick worker. He is one of 160Parisian doctors who are on constant call for emergencies in hospitals and private homesas part of a French insurance system, SOS Medecins. He had treated accident victimsmany times when he was a member of SAMU, the French emergency ambulanceservice. And yet a doctor on constant call for emergencies says that all he had in his carto help Diana was an oxygen cylinder and mask! Mailliez was in control of Diana andher condition for the crucial 15 to 20 minutes before his former employers, the SAMUemergency team, arrived to take over. He claims that Diana did not say anything to him,but this contradicts his comment to the London Times that “She kept saying how muchshe hurt as I put a resuscitation mask over her mouth”. Trevor Rees-Jones, thebodyguard, also says he had flashbacks of hearing a female voice calling out in the backof the car: “First it’s a groan. Then Dodi’s name was called... And that can only bePrincess Diana’s voice” he told the Daily Mirror.53 How reliable that statement is,however, is open to debate. What does seem to be clear is that Diana was conscious or atleast semi-conscious when Mailliez arrived. He told the CNN chat show host, Larry"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"437King, that: “She looked pretty fine. At the beginning... from the outside, you know, shelooked pretty fine. But inside, you know, the internal injury was already starting... It’sreally funny. That’s the only part, where she was sitting, that’s the only part which wasstill intact.” Mailliez on one hand told a French medical magazine that: “I thought her lifecould be saved” and yet said another time that “It was hopeless. There was nothing wecould do to save her.” He also told King that although Diana is the most photographedwoman in the world, and the paparazzi were taking shots of her while he was with her inthe tunnel, he had no idea that she was Princess Diana until he saw the news reports thefollowing morning. Excuse me? The pigs are airborne again. When the emergency teamarrived, Malliez says he left the scene because there was nothing more he could do.The official explanation for the incredible delay in taking Diana to hospital is that shewas trapped in the wreckage. This is a lie, lie, lie. One of the ambulance crew told theFrench newspaper, La Parisien, that when he arrived Diana was lying with most of herbody out of the car with her legs resting on the rear seat. “She was agitated, semiknocked out, but conscious... she was groaning and struggling feebly. She murmured‘Oh my God’ several times.” The Scotsman newspaper, in an investigation published onSeptember 11th 1997, established that Diana was removed from the car shortly after thefire brigade arrived and the excuse of her being ‘trapped’ does not stand up. Anotherofficial excuse for the delay is that the emergency doctors had to give her a bloodtransfusion. This is another lie, lie, lie. SAMU teams do not carry blood transfusionequipment because they would not know the victim’s blood type. When the ambulancedid leave the tunnel, the driver was ordered to go no faster than 25 miles an hour andsome reports say it took as long as 40 minutes to cover the 3.7 miles (6km) to the LaPitie-Salpetriere. Four other hospitals quite capable of treating Diana were closer to thescene and the ambulance stopped twice on the way for ‘delicate interventions’, one ofthem within sight of the hospital. Diana arrived at La Pitie-Salpetriere about 2.lOam, anhour and 45 minutes after the crash happened. By any medical criteria whatsoever thisdelay was utterly ludicrous, unless it was meant to happen. It doesn’t take a genius to seewhy, despite such apparent incompetence, there has been no inquiry into the medicalresponse that night. Waiting at the hospital were a surgical team headed by ProfessorBruno Riou, the duty surgeon who, we are told, first heard about the crash while doinghis rounds. Is it only me that finds it strange that a renowned surgeon is ‘doing hisrounds’ in the early hours of the morning? Waiting with him when Diana arrived wereProfessor Pierre Coriat, the head of anaesthetics, Professor Alain Pavie, a chest and heartspecialist, and Professor Pierre Benazet, another experienced surgeon. They had been intelephone communication with the emergency team in the tunnel throughout. We are toldthey opened Diana’s chest cavity, repaired the vein, and ‘battled to save her’ for an hourand a half before admitting defeat. I find this remarkable, also, because the autopsyreport apparently shows that Diana was clinically dead at 12.45am while still lying in thetunnel. She would therefore have been clinically dead for an hour and 25 minutes beforeshe even arrived at the hospital and for three hours before the professors walked out ofthe operating theatre to announce that she had died. Having the body examined at a"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"438location you control is vital in such assassinations. President Kennedy’s body wasflown immediately out of Dallas to the Brotherhood-front, the Bethesda Naval Centernear Washington DC, for the post mortem. Here the president’s brain went missing (orhis look-alike’s did) and, as the US Assassination Records Review Board revealed, theautopsy notes and the first draft of the post mortem were burned.So who was behind Diana’s assassination? It is important to stress that those whogave the order and those who did the deed would be very different. We are looking at aBrotherhood here, a spider’s web, and while the order will have come from the spider orspiders in the centre, it will have been mostly carried out by the flies. It is highly unlikelythat it would have been done directly by British Intelligence because that would be tooobvious. Intelligence agencies subcontract the assassinations of their own citizens to putthem at arms length from the incident and to allow them to ‘plausibly deny’ that theywere responsible. For instance, there is considerable evidence that President Kennedywas shot by members of an elite rifle team within a renegade unit of French Intelligencecalled the OAS, or at least that they were involved in the plot. Olof Palme, theBilderberger Prime Minister of Sweden, was murdered in Stockholm in 1986 on theorders of, among others, George Bush. But the killing was carried out by members ofBOSS, the South African Intelligence agency (see .. And The Truth Shall Set You Free).The British Foreign Office has its own assassination squad called Group 13 (that numberagain) and British Intelligence has a long and sick history of political and economicassassinations. British Intelligence consists of MIS (Military Intelligence 5) which isresponsible officially for domestic security, and M16 which deals with overseas matters.MIS announced in 1988 that they do not assassinate people. No, they get others to do itfor them. This pathetic denial was prompted by the revelations of the former MIS agent,David Shayler, that M16 had organised a plot to assassinate Libya’s Colonel Gaddafi.The attempt had failed because the bomb was put under the wrong car. Shayler was headof the ‘Libyan Desk’ at MIS and was in the perfect position to know. Robin Cook, theForeign Secretary, who is so far out of his depth he needs a frogman’s suit, said that hehad been assured that no such event took place. Oh, that’s OK then. The attorney-generalbanned David Shayler from appearing on the ITV programme, Diana - Secrets of theCrash, and later Shayler was arrested and jailed in Paris awaiting extradition to London.Why do that if what he is saying is such nonsense? Because, of course, he’s right. By theway, the oath of allegiance by British Intelligence officers is not to the government, butto the monarch. It is the same with Members of Parliament and the military. Ultimatelythe Queen is their boss under the law, although, in truth, their boss is whoever controlsthe Queen because even she is not at the top of the pile.The type of organisation most likely to have been involved in Diana’s death, at theoperational level is typified by the Pinay Circle or ‘Le Cerde’ which has a number ofBritish establishment figures in its ranks. Le Cerde is an offshoot of the even more eliteSafari Club, which was set up by Count Alexander de Maranches, the Director duringthe 1970s of the French Service for External Documentation and Espionage. It was theSafari Club which arranged for the alliance between a French Intelligence front-"},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"439company called Group Bull and the computer giant Honeywell which is, you will besurprised to know, the world’s biggest manufacturer of landmines. This alliancesupplied landmines to both sides in the Bosnian conflict. The Safari Club began as aconsortium of the secret police of the Shah of Iran called SAVAK, Saddam Hussein inIraq, Anwar Sadat of Egypt and Saudi Arabian Intelligence. It has been involved incountless coups in Africa to further its goals and is heavily involved in arms trading andsupply. Out of the Safari Club came the Pinay Circle or Le Cerde, named after theFrench Prime Minister, Antoine Pinay, who attended the first Bilderberg Meeting inOosterbeek, Holland, in May 1954. Others involved with Le Cerde included theHabsburg family. To give you an idea of its make up and range of influence, the LeCerde membership has included Nicholas Elliot, a department head at M16; WilliamColby, a former director of the CIA; Colonel Botta of Swiss Military Intelligence;Stefano Della Chiaie, a leading member of the Italian Secret Service; Giullo Andreotti,the former Italian Prime Minister from the notorious P2 Freemasonry Lodge and theman who gave the Mafia official protection; Silva Munoz, a former minister for thefascist, Franco, in Spain and a member of the Elite secret society, Opus Dei; Franz JosefStrauss, the German defence minister; and Monsignor Brunello, an agent to the Vatican.In America, one of the Le Cerde fronts is the CIA-backed Heritage Foundation inWashington. Look at the potential for such an organisation to be the coordinating forcebetween countless different agencies and countries all to achieve a common aim. TheSafari Club-Le Cerde network provides the Arab-British-French connection necessaryto arrange for Diana to be in Paris at the right time, the security for her to be withdrawn,the assassination to be carried out, and those involved to get away with it. What wasthat John Stalker said? “Why would the French want to cover up the murder of a Britishwoman?” It is also interesting that Simon Regan in his book, Who Killed Diana?, saysthat it was Le Cerde which destablised the Gough Whitlam government in Australia in1975. The Queen was certainly involved in that, too. As I explained earlier, it was herGovernor of Australia, John Kerr, who removed Whitlam in the end. If the Windsorsand Le Cerde worked together to bring down an elected Australian Government, whycould they not have worked together to eliminate Diana?Paris, with its immense Brotherhood associations going back centuries, has longbeen a favourite location for their murders and plots. Amschel Rothschild from theEnglish branch of the family, was murdered there in his hotel room in 1996 in whatsome claim to have been part of one of the inter-Brotherhood wars which have litteredtheir history. For an organisation like Le Cerde, or its many mirrors in London, it wouldhave been easy to place its people in the right places. Mohamed Al Fayed’s securityoperation is awash with former members of elite British military and police units whoknow the consequences of saying “No” to the Brotherhood, even if they don’t wish tobe involved. In the same way, these spider structures ensure that their people control theinquiries into their assassinations, as they did most famously with Kennedy. EvenMohamed Al Fayed’s personal investigation into Diana’s death was headed by PierreOttavoili, a former chief of the Criminal Brigade, the criminal investigation department"},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"440of French Police. This is the same organisation which is also responsible for the officialinvestigation. Al Fayed’s chief lawyer in Paris is a former French Justice Minister, andin overall charge in London is John Macnamara, his head of security and a former ChiefSuperintendent at the headquarters of London’s Metropolitan Police, Scotland Yard. Inthe Spring of 1998, Macnamara was part of a ‘sting’ operation involving the FBI, CIAand possibly, the Israeli (Rothschild) Intelligence Agency Mossad, to arrest a formerCIA agent Oswald Le Winter, a 67-year-old American born in Austria. Le Wintercontacted Al Fayed claiming to have documents for sale proving the involvement ofM16 and the CIA in Diana’s murder. He was asking $10 million and after a meetingwith Macnamara he was given an advance of $15,000. A further meeting was arrangedin Vienna, Austria, for the key documents and the rest of the money to be handed over.In the meantime, however, Al Fayed called a friend in the FBI, who contacted the CIA.Le Winter was followed, spied on, and lured to the Ambassador Hotel in Vienna onWednesday April 22nd, where with support from the Austrian police a combination ofFBI, CIA and possibly Mossad agents pounced on him. All this for an alleged hoaxer?The story would have remained secret, but for Peter Grolig, an Austrian journalist onthe Kurier newspaper. He reported what happened and established that when LeWinter’s hotel room was searched, four documents, two of them in code, were foundand appeared to be genuine CIA documents. The CIA have since admitted tappingDiana’s phone calls in, and to, America and passing the contents to British Intelligence.Le Winter was arrested and held in custody. Grolig’s story forced Al Fayed to admit thatit was true. So was Le Winter trapped by such an array of international securitypersonnel because he was selling a hoax to Al Fayed or because he was selling thetruth? Another intelligence insider also insists the crash was not an accident. RichardTomlinson, a former agent of Britain’s M16, gave evidence to the French inquiry intoDiana’s death. In 1997 Tomlinson served a six month jail sentence under the OfficialSecrets Act for trying to sell his memoirs. In August 1998 he was arrested again, at gunpoint, in Paris at the request of the British Government who were concerned at hisassociation in that city with the MIS whistle-blower, David Shayler, who was alsoarrested and jailed in Paris.54 Tomlinson apparently told Herve Stephan, the judge incharge of the ‘inquiry’, that Diana was murdered. According to a report on the BBC’snews service, Ceefax, on August 28th 1998, he told the judge that Henri Paul was anasset of British Intelligence and so was “One of the bodyguards”. Which one was notnamed. Meanwhile Herve Stephan, a Brotherhood placeman, is doing all he can to holdthe line that it was an accident.The most important question to ask when you are trying to identify those responsiblefor a crime is: “Who benefits?” As the Roman wnter, Seneca, said: “He who mostbenefits from a crime is the one most likely to have committed it”. Well the Windsorsbenefited magnificently. No longer is Diana there to continue her inevitable destructionof the Monarchy’s credibility and public esteem with her actions and her knowledge oftheir secrets. No longer is she there to bring her influence on the upbringing and attitudesof the future king, Prince William and his brother Prince Harry. The Windsors now have"},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"441complete control of them, to mould them into their image. They couldn’t do that beforebecause Diana’s influence was too strong and I hope the memory of that will encouragethe princes to withstand the indoctrination. The way is now paved for Charles’ marriageto Camilla Parker-Bowles without the complication of Diana and, of course, his royalduty to produce Windsor heirs with Spencer genes, although as we shall see, Williammight not be his child. Understandably, it has been suggested that Diana was killedbecause of her campaign against landmines. This is not true, not directly anyway. Thelandmine manufacturers have done very nicely from her campaign, because they makefar more money from clearing mines than they do making them. A mine costs about £30to produce, but at least £3,000 to clear. Clearing all the mines around the world isestimated at £330 billion. No, the landmine manufacturers like Honeywell were notagainst Diana’s campaign, they loved it for their own reasons. But what she showed veryclearly was the power she had to take an issue from the shadows and hurl it into thepublic arena. The question could well have been: “What will she do next?”. And whatwas it that Diana had to reveal, as she told my contact, that would “Shake the world”?Henry Kissinger, one of the greatest Brotherhood manipulators of the 20th century, metDiana a number of times and sickeningly attended her funeral. He said in an interviewafter her death that: “She was politically and diplomatically uncontrollable”. That isKissinger-speak for “That’s one reason she was killed”. From the perspective of theoperational level of the Brotherhood pyramid, as with Kennedy, there were many reasonswhy they wanted her dead. But, as I keep emphasising, that is only one level. At the topare the Elite black magic adepts, the reptilian full bloods and crossbreeds. At the highestlevel of the Brotherhood, Diana’s death, like Kennedy’s, was a ritual killing. It was longplanned for the effect it would have on the people and the magnetic field of the Earth,and to symbolise the introduction of the New World Order. Don’t underestimate thefantastic power of ritual and symbolism in affecting the human psyche and the planet’smagnetic field. These people afe not obsessed with it for no reason.The Brotherhood and Satanic symbolism surrounding Diana’s death is endless and tounderstand the background to her ritual murder we must, once again, go back a very longtime. Diana was one of the greatest goddesses of the ancient world and she representedthe female energy also known as Barati, Britannia, Isis, Artemis, Aphrodite, all thesedifferent names for the same energy. If you go back far enough, they symbolise the sameentity, also, Ninkharsag. Diana was known as a Moon goddess. One tribe of Elitebloodlines who worshipped the goddess Diana were called the Sicambrian Franks whocan be traced from Troy (that name again), through Asia Minor, now Turkey, theCaucasus Mountains (again) and up into Europe. They lived at one time in an area westof the River Danube and settled in Germania, named by the Romans after the Scythian‘genuine ones’ with their centre in Cologne. They also invaded parts of Roman-occupiedGaul, the land which is now Belgium and northern France, from where the ‘noble’families of Scotland were to come. It is from these Sicambrian Franks that we get thename France. At the time of King Meroveus, who was named Guardian of the Franks in448, this people became known as the Merovingians and Princess Diana, through the"},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"442Stuart bloodline, was related to them. Many seem to believe that the Merovingians aredescended from the bloodline of Jesus, but how they can be genetically descended froma myth defeats me. This is a diversion to mislead. They are, however, an Elite bloodlinethat goes back to the Aryan race in the ancient Middle and Near East and eventually goesoff planet. The Merovingians were the sorcerer kings who were noted for their esotericknowledge and magical powers which they inherited from the underground bloodlinestreams of secret groups and initiations. Francio, the founder of the Franks, claimed to bea descendant of Noah and his ancestors once resided in ancient Troy of wooden horsefame. The French city of Troyes, where the Templars were officially formed, was namedby the Sicambrian Franks after their former home. The Iliad says that Troy was foundedby Dardanus, the son of the Greek god Zeus, who was depicted as both an eagle and aserpent. Zeus was born in Arcadia in Sparta, it is said, and the Spartans migrated intoFrance. These are the bloodlines we are talking about here, not those of ‘Jesus’.The city of Paris was established by the Sicambrian Franks in the 6th century afterthey became known as the Merovingians. It was named after Prince Paris, the son ofKing Priam of Troy. It was the relationship between Prince Paris and Helen of Spartawhich supposedly caused the Trojan War in which the Trojan Horse (infiltration) assuredvictory for the Spartans. Both the Trojans and the Spartans were branches of the sameAryan peoples and within them were the reptilian bloodlines. Paris in those days wasconfined to an island in the River Seine which is now known as the Ile de la Cite or Isleof the City. The Notre Dame Cathedral, built by the Templars on a site of former Dianaworship, stands on the Ile de la Cite today and this is where the Templar Grand Master,Jacques de Molay, was roasted to death. The Merovingians established the city of Parison a major vortex point which is why the Notre Dame Cathedral is built on that spot.Meroveus, the founder of the Merovingian dynasty, followed the goddess cult of Dianaand this is not surprising because the epicentre for Diana worship was at the famoustemple at Ephesus in Asia Minor, not far from the alleged site of Troy. The temple isnamed as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Diana was known as Queenof Heaven, just like Semiramis. Outside the original Paris - and now very much insidethe modern city - the Merovingians established an underground chamber for the worshipof the goddess Diana and for the blood rituals and human sacrifices to her. This site datesback at least to 500-750 AD and it was here that kings in dispute over property wouldsettle the issue in combat. According to legend, anyone killed there goes straight toHeaven and sits at the right hand of God. Now get this: The location today of thisunderground sacrificial site for the goddess Diana is... the Pont de L’Alma tunnel!The word pont relates to Pontifex, a Roman high priest, and it means passage orbridge. Alma comes from Al-Mah, a Middle Eastern name for, wait for it... the Moongoddess. So the Pont de UAlma translates as ‘Bridge of the Moon Goddess’ and theadjoining Place de L’Alma is the ‘Place of the Moon Goddess’. And the Moon goddessis Diana. It can also translate as ‘Bridge of the Soul’ and a ‘Maiden’ of the goddessDiana was called an Al-mah! This is why Henri Paul was programmed to drive past theturning to Dodi Fayed’s flat and head for the Pont de L’Alma tunnel. This is why the"},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"443emergency team kept her in the tunnel for so long instead of rushing her to hospital whereher life would have been saved. She wasn’t meant to be saved and they only moved herwhen she was clinically dead, as the autopsy report confirmed. According to BrotherhoodSatanic ritual, Diana had to die in that underground chamber on the ancient sacrificial siteand it had to happen at night under the Moon in the goddess month of August, ruledaccording to legend by the Roman version of Isis, Diana, etc: Juno Augusta. The Satanistsin the emergency team simply ensured that Diana would not leave the tunnel (sacrificialchamber) alive. We are told she bled to death and, if this is correct, it was precisely inaccordance with their blood rites and sacrificial rites. But was the bleeding caused in theway we are told, or by some other chemical means? We now know that Diana wasclinically dead about 12.45 am, yet she was taken to the La Pitie Salpetriere Hospital andkept in the operating theatre for an hour and a half while the medical team, ProfessorBruno Riou, Professor Pierre Coriat, Professor Alain Pavie and Professor Jean PierreBenazat, cut open her chest and “battled to save her”. Save a woman who had alreadybeen clinically dead for an hour and fifteen minutes when she arrived at the hospital?When they had finished, the French Minister of the Interior, Jean-Pierre Chevenement,decreed, according to his senior advisor, Sami Mani, that there would be strictly noadmittance to the room in which her body was laid out.55 Chevenement was one of several‘VIPs’ who rushed to the tunnel and observed the medical operation at this formersacrificial site.56 The Brotherhood Mother Goddess, Arizona Wilder, said that Guy deRothschild had talked about Diana’s death in early 1998 when he tried to reprogrammeher at a house in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles. Rothschild was using a pseudonym, DrBarrington. He said that he was in the tunnel that night to “Steal Diana’s soul” through the‘evil eye’ hypnotic gaze the reptiles use at the point of death. I explained this earlier inrelation to Pindar. A contact in Denmark told me that during her last year of medicalstudies at the Copenhagen University in 1983 she realised that severely mentally illpatients were being used for experiments by being inseminated with genetically tamperedsemen. The pregnancy, she said, was very painful and often unsuccessful. Sometimes thepatient died and the foetus was dissected in secrecy. She went on: “The doctorsconducting these experiments were professors, heads of departments, PhDs, the mostoutstanding in their field. They had a kind of Brotherhood... many of them were psychicand monkeyed with black magic. Incredible amounts of money were flowing to them.” Astory that could be repeated thousands of times all over the world.Another name for the goddess Diana is Hecate. One of the ancient ‘triads’ or‘trinities’ was that of Diana, Luna and Hecate who were said to be three aspects of thesame female energy. It was called Diana on Earth, Luna in Heaven, and Hecate in Hell.Hecate is one of the premier deities of Satanism and she is a version of Aphrodite andVenus, different names for the same energy. After her husband’s death, Jackie Kennedytravelled to the Greek island of Delos in the south west Aegean Sea, the legendarybirthplace of Diana and Apollo and the considered domain of Hecate, the goddess of the‘infernal arts’. Delos is known for this reason as the Island of the Dead. Hecate wasportayed as both the virgin and the whore and crossroads are the sacred places of"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"444Diana-Hecate. It is at crossroads that the witches and the Grand Masters and sorcerers ofFreemasonry perform their rituals. Crossroads are symbolic of the vortex points createdwhere ley lines cross. In ritual sex magic, the wearing of clothes of the opposite sex andthe performance of bi-sexual acts are called ‘Crossroad Rites’. The women involvedwere called ‘dikes’. Crossroads are also places of human and animal sacrifice and Hecateis known as a ‘sex and death goddess’ and the goddess of witchcraft and sorcery. At thePont de L’Alma, right at the spot where Diana died, the road that goes through the tunnelis crossed on the surface by another road which leads onto the Pont de L’Alma Bridge. Infact this spot is a maze of crossroads. And Diana died in the early morning of August31st. Hecate’s Day in the Satanic calendar is August 13th, but under the Satanic law ofreverse symbolism and reverse numbers, Hecate’s day of sacrifice is... August 31st!!So just look at the symbolism of this. Diana, named after the ancient Moon goddess,was driven from the Ritz and through the Place de la Concorde where she passed the3,200 year-old Egyptian obelisk brought to Paris from Luxor with it’s tip or pyramidcoloured bright gold symbolising the penis of Osiris. It was at this very point, a minutefrom where Diana died, that Queen Marie Antoinette was beheaded at the guillotineduring the Brotherhood-engineered French Revolution, another symbolic blood sacrificeof the female energy. Diana was then driven at speed to the Pont de UAlma tunnel, theBridge or Place of the Moon Goddess, where the car struck the 13th pillar, thesymbolism for which is simply enormous for obvious reasons and for others I’ll come tolater. Now she was left to die on the very site of an ancient underground sacrificialchamber to the goddess Diana and bled to death according to Satanic ritual. She alsodied at a crossroads with one road under the ground, the other above, and the crossroadsis the sacred place for the Satanic deity, Hecate, another aspect of the ‘Diana’ energy.And it all happened on Hecate’s day for sacrifice, August 31st. Does anyone doubt thatthis was a ritual murder? And I’ve not even nearly finished with the symbolismsurrounding her death. Remember what David Berkowitz, the Satanist serial killer inNew York known as the Son of Sam, wrote about those involved in the Satanic network:“...Satanists (genuine ones) are peculiar people. They aren’t ignorant peasants orsemi-literate natives. Rather, their ranks are filled with doctors, lawyers, businessmen, andbasically highly responsible citizens... They are not a careless group who are apt to makemistakes. But they are secretive and bonded together by a common need and desire tomete out havoc on society. It was Aleister Crowley who said: ‘I want blasphemy, murder,rape, revolution, anything bad’.”57It is worth emphasising again here the Satanists’ relationship with female energy.The challenge we all face is to balance male and female energies and so enjoy the bestaspects of them and not the extremes. The Satanists, however, seek to express only theextremes, thus creating disharmony and conflict. They use the malevolent, highlynegative expressions of the female energy (covert manipulation behind the scenes) tocreate the events and circumstances which the extremes of the male energy (macho"},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"445men, soldiers, terrorism) can play out in the public arena. Because of this it appears thatthe world is controlled and dominated by male energy - it’s a ‘mans world’, but in truthit is not a world dominated by the male, it is a world dominated by extremes of maleand female. I am not talking men and women here, I mean male and female energywhich can be expressed by both men or women. For instance, the Brotherhoodmanipulators like Henry Kissinger never see a gun fired in anger. They are not out therephysically fighting (male energy) in the wars they engineer. They are manipulatingevents from the shadows and behind our backs, a trait of the negative female energy andsymbolised by the story of the Trojan Horse. The female energy is also the creativeforce and you can create negatively or positively. The Brotherhood are highlymalevolent, but very creative. For this reason, in esoteric law and symbolism, thefemale energy (Diana, Semiramis, Isis, Barati, Britannia) is given different names for itsdifferent expressions. The Egyptians portrayed Isis in white in her positive mode and inblack to symbolise her negative aspect. In the same way we have the symbolism ofDiana (positive female) and Hecate (negative female). They are simply differentsymbolic names for different manifestations of the female energy. The Satanists of theBrotherhood work with the Hecate energy and that is why they worship this deity. Theyare actually worshipping the extreme negative female energy and it is for this reasonthat in Satanism the high priestess is considered as important as the priest, if not moreso. At that Elite centre for Satanism in Belgium, the Castle of Darkness I mentioned inan earlier chapter, the top position in the hierarchy is not known as the king, but theQueen Mother. So in the Pont de L’Alma Tunnel the positive female energy (love,compassion, intuition), symbolised by Diana, was eliminated by the negative femaleenergy (manipulation, ritual death), symbolised by Hecate and the crossroads.The death of Dodi Fayed was also crucial to the Satanic symbolism. Given thecircumstances of his death, it is quite a coincidence that his real name, Emad El Din, isArabic for ‘Pillar of Faith’. Dodi was a nickname he was given as a toddler by his family.This, too, is interesting. It is very close to Dido and in fact ‘Dido’ was the nickname hegave to Diana. Dido in Greek mythology was the legendary founder and queen ofCarthage (an Aryan people connected to the Phoenicians) and she was the daughter ofBelus, king of the Phoenician city of Tyre. When Dido’s husband was killed by herbrother, Pygmalion, she fled with her followers to North Africa where she purchasedCarthage from the native ruler, Larbus. He later threatened Dido with war unless shemarried him, but instead she killed herself. But the most likely symbols for Dodi Fayed’sdeath can be found in his birthplace, Egypt. The Brotherhood are obsessed with thesymbolism in ancient Egypt of the Osiris-Horus-Isis trinity (Nimrod-Tammuz-Semiramis)which is expressed in Christianity as father, son, and holy ghost. Among many things, itsymbolises the male and female energies coming together to create a third force, new life.To the Egyptians, and therefore the Brotherhood, the son of God was Horus. He was bornto Isis after her husband, Osiris, had been murdered by Set. She gathered together 14 partsof his mutilated body, but she could not find the penis. So she created a penis andimpregnated herself to conceive Horus, the Sun God - Sun King, Horus was Osiris"},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"446reborn. In Paris, part of this ritual was played out again. The car passed the golden-tippedEgyptian obelisk, the penis of Osiris, in the Place de la Concorde, and inside the vehiclewere Diana (another name for Isis) and the Egyptian, Dodi Fayed, representing Osiris. Ihave heard from many sources that Diana was pregnant. Her foetus symbolised Horus,the Sun King. In ancient Egypt, they said that Osiris had to die before Horus could comein. This will sound amazing to most people, but if you study the unbelievable obsessionthese people have with ritual and symbolism it makes perfect sense. Diana may not evenhave realized she was pregnant. It could have been the foetus they were removing on theoperating table in Paris while they “battled to save her” for hours after she was clinicallydead. I have heard suggestions that the cells from the foetus are being used to clonebabies from this genetic mix. These will be ‘Sun gods’ according to Brotherhood ritual.The cloning of humans has been possible for a long time, as the cloning of sheep at theRoslyn Institute near Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland has clearly shown. The Brotherhood’ssecret science is always far in advance of anything allowed into the public domain andbecause of this the public find it impossible to believe what the Brotherhood can do withdrugs and technology. So it is with their mind control techniques and I am sure that bothDiana and Dodi had been under the influence of mind manipulation over many weeks toensure the ritual happened as required. For goodness sake, a stage hypnotist can takeover the mind of someone from the audience. Just think what is possible for those mindmanipulators at the global cutting edge.The Pont de L’Alma is one of the most sacred places in the world to the Brotherhoodand, as with the street plans in all their key cities, they made sure the site was full ofappropriate symbolism: the bridge, the underground chamber, the crossroads and thename. Since my own spiritual awakening in 19901 have been guided by mysubconscious intuition to many Earth power centres. Often I have not been aware of thisat the time and only with hindsight have I seen how, on a non-conscious level, I hadbeen drawn to a major vortex point on the magnetic grid system and often to those ofparticular importance to the Brotherhood. In 1994 I was on holiday with my family nearthe Normandy coast in France and we decided to visit Paris. It was a long drive, but wehad never seen the city before. We drove to Versailles outside Paris and took the trainfrom there to the station at the Eiffel Tower. It was a hot, humid, and sweaty day, andthe area was packed with people and heavy with traffic. This combination was sounpleasant that we decided not to stay very long before taking the train back toVersailles, but first we went for a short walk. We crossed the River Seine by afootbridge near the Eiffel Tower and walked a hundred yards or so alongside the riverbank on the far side before finding a seat to rest. After sitting there for about tenminutes we walked over the nearby road bridge and back to the railway station to leavethe city. We were in the place for little more than an hour and that is all I hadexperienced of Paris until I went back to research Diana’s death for this book.When I returned to Paris I had quite a shock because I found that seat again wherewe rested in 1994. It is on top of the Pont de L’Alma tunnel very close to the 13th pillarwhere the car crashed! Also, near that seat above the mouth of the tunnel is a large"},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"447depiction of a lighted torch (see picture section). This, of course, is the most obviousBrotherhood signature of them all and after President Kennedy’s ritual killing, theFreemasons erected an obelisk in Dealey Plaza with a lighted torch at the top. Anotherflame was placed on his grave. The one on the Pont de UAlma Tunnel stands on a blackpentagram and there isn’t a more powerful Satanic symbol than that. It is supposed tobe a ‘Flame of Liberty’ (a copy of the flame held by the Statue of Liberty) tocommemorate those who died in the Second World War, but it’s location has,predictably, ensured that it has become a shrine to Diana. One newspaper report saidthat the French authorities were considering a permanent memorial to Diana at the Pontde L’Alma - a continuation of the 13th pillar above the ground! I can’t think of anythingmore sick or more symbolic than that. The last I heard they planned to open a vegetablegarden to commemorate her death and they were going to pull down a building to makeway for it. The garden is an area of Paris that Diana is never known to have visited andshe had no recorded passion for growing vegetables. So what goes on? Well, first I betyou’ll find that the vegetable garden will be on another ancient site of some kind, andmost importantly such an inadequate and bizarre memorial will ensure that the flameabove the tunnel will now remain the public shrine to Diana.The Flame of Liberty was placed on the tunnel entrance in 1987 and I am certain theassassination of Diana at that spot was planned well before then. It is quite conceivable,given the Brotherhood’s long term planning and meticulous attention to ritual andsymbolic detail, that it was planned for decades. Definitely before the sacrificial lambwas hooked into the Windsor web to marry Charles. It was Brotherhood symbolismwhich decided the location of their wedding at St Paul’s Cathedral. St Paul’s, with itsvast dome, was designed by Sir Christopher Wren, the high Brotherhood initiate. It’sdesign is mirrored by both the Congress Building in Washington DC and by thePantheon in Paris. Brutus, the Trojan who became first king of the Britons in about1,1O3BC, was the man who founded ‘New Troy’, known today as London. He wasanother who worshipped the goddess Diana and he is reported to have erected a templeto her on what is now called Ludgate Hill on the site of a former stone circle.58 This isin the heart of the City of London financial district, that centre of Brotherhood control,and today on this site of Diana worship you will find... St Paul’s Cathedral. In Paris, theNotre Dame (Our Lady) Cathedral is on an ancient site of Diana worship and theambulance carrying the princess’s body passed Notre Dame during that bizarre journeyto hospital. So Diana was married on an ancient sacred site to the goddess Diana andshe died on the site of an ancient sacrificial chamber of the goddess Diana. She was alsohunted and used by the Windsors to produce heirs and Diana was the ancient goddess ofhunting, fertility and childbirth.When Prince Charles and Diana’s sisters went to Paris to escort her body back toLondon, the coffin was draped in the royal standard, the flag of the Windsors which iscovered with the Sun symbol, the lion. Not the flag of the country, you’ll note, but theflag of the Windsors. Another strange coincidence happened at the HammersmithMortuary in London. As her coffin arrived, the one carrying Dodi was leaving and they"},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"448apparently crossed at the entrance. What are the statistical chances of that when bothmade such very different journeys from Paris? Dodi, we were told, had to be buriedwithin 24 hours of his death according to Muslim religious law and there was a mad rushby his father to meet the deadline. There was no autopsy on his body, a quick externalexamination was considered enough.At this point, Diana’s brother, Charles, Earl Spencer, then 33, came on the scene afterflying back from his home in Cape Town, South Africa. When Earl Spencer, the Queen’sgod-son, made his maiden speech in the House of Lords in 1993, he chose a ratherstrange subject, Satanism On The Spencer’s Althorp Estate In Northamptonshire. Heacknowledged that it was going on, but he said he was doing all he could to eradicate it.What a remarkable topic to introduce in your first speech in the Houses of Parliament.The Brotherhood Mother Goddess, Arizona Wilder, reports seeing Earl Spencer and hisfather at some of the sacrificial rituals she conducted. It was Earl Spencer whoannounced that, despite her wishes, Diana’s body would not be interred in the familytomb at the local village church at Great Brington near the estate. Earl Spencer said hewanted to avoid swamping the village with sightseers and he had decided that Dianawould be buried on a man-made island in the centre of a lake on the Althorp Estate. Thelake is called The Oval and when looked at from above, the island looks like a dot withina circle, a symbol of the Sun. The flame in a circle is on Kennedy’s grave. Also on theisland, Spencer has placed the Brotherhood symbol of a burning flame and at one stage,Mohamed Al Fayed said he was going to put an ‘eternal flame’ to Diana and Dodi on theroof of Harrods to mark the first anniversary of their deaths in August 1998.59Islands are very much part of the legends of the goddess Diana and she was supposedto have been born on the island of Delos in the Aegean Sea. It is also known as the Islandof the Dead after Hecate, the patroness of the ‘infernal arts’, the negative aspect of theDiana goddess energy. Diana is another name for Brito-Martis, the goddess of Cretewhich was colonised and developed by the Phoenicians who created the Minoancivilisation. Brito-Martis was actually a Phoenician goddess, according to Greek andRoman legend. She was the divine ‘daughter’ of Phoinix (correctly spelt) the King ofPhoenicia, and was armed, like Diana, with weapons for the chase. Legend says thatBrito-Martis (Diana) sailed from Phoenicia to Argos in Southern Greece and onto Cretewhere she was pursued by her unwelcome admirer, Minos. She escaped by retreating tothe sea and sailed to Aegina, an island in the Aegean where stands the temple of Artemisor Diana. Islands and Diana are very much connected in the legends. Earl Spencer putDiana’s grave among trees on the island and this is classic symbolism because theancients used to worship the goddess Diana in the tree groves and this was said to be hermost sacred place. Sir James Frazer describes in his book, The Golden Bough, the Dianarite known as the King of the Wood at Lake Nemi (again a lake is a big part of Dianalegend). The Lady of the Lake is also Brotherhood symbolism. Frazer says that on thenorthern shore of Lake Nemi, under the cliffs on which the modern village of Nemi, nearAricia, is perched, was the sacred grove and sanctuary of Diana Nemorensis, or Diana ofthe Wood, the goddess of hunting. Lake Nemi is the most celebrated shrine to the"},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"449goddess Diana and here, says Frazer, there grew a tree around which the figure of apriest would be seen with a sword. A candidate for the priesthood in the cult of Dianacould only succeed by killing the present incumbent and he would only keep the jobuntil someone in turn killed him. The post carried the title of king - King of the Wood -and a long line of priest-kings who served Diana met a violent end. So the goddessDiana is associated with islands and a lake and was worshipped among the trees. AndEarl Spencer puts his sister’s grave among the trees on an island in a lake.Then there is the strange tale of the black swans. In June 1998, Earl Spencer gave aninterview for BBC Television in which he told of a dream he claimed to have had betweenthe crash in Paris and Diana’s funeral. In the dream, he said, he had been told to put fourblack swans on the lake around the island. When he called his estate manager the nextmorning and asked him where he would find four black swans, the manager is supposedto have said: “You’ve heard then?”. “Heard what?”, Spencer claims to have asked.“We’ve been offered four black swans”, the estate manager replied. Maybe this is true,but, in my view, this story has more to do with flying pigs than flying swans. Black swansare profound occult symbols used in rituals and were the seal of the infamous Satanist,Catherine de Medici, who, Arizona Wilder says, was a previous incarnation of the QueenMother. They appear most obviously in the ballet, Swan Lake, when the black swan,symbolising the negative female energy, kills the white swan, symbolising the positive. Inother words, Hecate kills Diana. What better symbolism can you have of Swan Lake thanblack swans on a lake, as at Althorp? A swan is a derogatory term in Druidism. ProjectMonarch slaves who rebel are told that they will be “Turned into swans” and Diana, ofcourse, rebelled against the Windsors. The number of swans also fits here. Monarchprogramming includes a term called The Four Gates of Heaven and four could alsosymbolise the four phases of the Moon. Earl Spencer has established a ‘temple’ to Dianaat the side of the lake. A number of the stately homes of the British aristocracy havetemples or areas featuring the goddess Diana, among them Blenheim Palace home of theMarlboroughs and Chatsworth House, headquarters of the Cavendish’s, the Dukes ofDevonshire, and both families are related to the Spencers. Diana was carried in aleadAined coffin and lead is the metal associated in ritual magic with Saturn, possiblyfrom where we get the name Satan. The colour associated with Saturn and Satanism isblack. Diana was also led to her death across the two key Brotherhood days of Saturn-dayand Sun-day. The 15th-century Italian philosopher-doctor from Horence, Marsiho Ficino,produced talismans for protection and the one for Saturn was engraved on pure lead. Itwas said to protect the wearer against death by assassination and ambush and protectedwomen in childbirth. On Diana’s lead coffin during the funeral were lilies, the flower ofLilith, another version of Hecate and a symbol of the bloodline. The lilies were chosen byEarl Spencer, Diana’s brother. The lily was also sacred to Astarte, another Diana deity,and it was used to symbolise the impregnation of the virgin Mary. The ‘blessed virgin’Juno, ruler of August, was said to have conceived her saviour-son, Mars, on a magic lily.The lily is symbolic of the reptilian bloodlines. In the year 656, the 10th Council ofToledo officially made the day of Juno’s legendary conception of Mars into the"},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"450Christian Festival of the Mother of God, or Lady Day, insisting that it commemoratedMary’s miraculous conception of Jesus with the aid of a lily.60 In France the peopleknew Lady Day as Notre Dame de Mars. The symbolism of the lily with the pregnantgoddess giving birth to the saviour-god (as in Isis and Horus) is fascinating, given thestories that Diana was pregnant at the time of her death and the way I have connectedthis to the legend of Osiris, Isis and Horus.There have also been questions about whether Diana is even buried on the island. Inthe Summer of 1998, the Star magazine in the United States quoted an unnamed “seniorsource” at Buckingham Palace as saying she was secretly cremated and according to areport in the Los Angeles Times some people in the village of Great Brington also don’tbelieve she is buried on the island. I know these reports are true from my own sources.One resident quoted by the LA Times said that the night her coffin was taken to Althorpfor burial, the village had been ‘invaded’ by the army, police and special forces units,and all the villagers were hustled into their homes. She said that the crematorium at thechurch was working late into the night. Betty Andrews, the former cook andhousekeeper at Althorp, is quoted by Star magazine as saying: “There’s a strangefeeling amongst the villagers that we may not be hearing the complete picture”.While researching this book I was introduced to Christine Fitzgerald, a brilliant andgifted healer, who was a close friend and confidant of Diana for nine years. Because ofChristine’s understanding of the esoteric, Diana was able to talk to her about mattersshe would not dare to share with anyone else for fear of being dubbed crazy. It is clearthat Diana knew about the true nature of the royal family’s genetic history and thereptilian control. Her nicknames for the Windsors were “the lizards” and “the reptiles”and she used to say in all seriousness: “They’re not human”. There is a very goodreason for Diana using this description of the Windsors. As her deprogrammingcontinued, Arizona Wilder remembered clearly a ritual she attended at Clarence House,the Queen Mother’s home near to Buckingham Palace, in which Diana was shown whothe Windsors really are. It took place in the first seven days of July 1981, just beforeDiana and Charles were married on the 29th. This period is the last seven days of thecycle of the Oak Tree, according to esoteric law, and the ritual was called TheAwakening of the Bride. This is a ritual for all females of the 13 bloodlines who aregoing to be in publicly high positions and marry reptilians to produce the newgeneration of rulers. Arizona says that the Queen Mother, the Queen, Prince Philip,Lady Fermoy, Diana’s father Earl Spencer, Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowleswere all present when Diana was brought into the room. She was wearing a white gownand a drug had been administered by Lady Fermoy. Diana was told that she shouldconsider her union with Prince Charles as only a means to produce heirs and nothingelse. Camilla Parker-Bowles was his consort, not her. Arizona says that Prince Philipand the Queen Mother then shape-shifted into reptiles to show Diana who they reallywere. ‘Diana was terrified, but quiet’, she said. Diana was told that if she ever revealedthe truth about them, she would be killed. (Remember the guy I mentioned who had acall from Diana in the March before she died asking for his advice on how to reveal"},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"451information about the royals that would ‘shake the world’?) The Queen Mother toldDiana at the ritual that “all ears” would be listening to everything she said and “alleyes” would forever be watching her. This is the classic ‘nowhere to run’ bind imposedon all mind controlled slaves. Does anyone believe, therefore, that they would allowDiana into the clutches of Mohamed Al Fayed if he was not under their control? Theritual also involved the use of a golden penis (Osiris symbolism) which was used onDiana to signify the ‘opening of the womb’. Arizona says it was of reptilian shape andsize and had needle-like protrusions designed to superficially puncture the walls of thevagina and cause bleeding. Diana was told that after this ritual, she would never be“honoured” again by attending their rituals and she was not to ask questions aboutthem. Now do people understand why Diana suffered from bulimia and seriousemotional problems from the time she married Charles?Diana told Christine Fitzgerald that the Queen Mother was the power behind theWindsors, along with Prince Philip. But Philip was subordinate in the hierarchy to theQueen Mother, Diana said. The Queen Mother is connected to a long list ofBrotherhood groups and societies and she is the head of the Inner Temple, the elite andhighly secret society for the upper levels of the legal profession on the ‘former’ KnightsTemplar land at Temple Bar in London. It was the Queen Mother and her close friend,Diana’s grandmother, Ruth Lady Fermoy, who manipulated Diana into the marriagewith Prince Charles. This is why Diana was given quarters at the Queen Mother’shome, Clarence House, in the weeks before the wedding and she left from there tomarry Charles at St Paul’s Cathedral. “Diana used to tell me that the Queen Mother wasevil”, Christine Fitzgerald said, “She actually used that word, evil. She said she hatedthe Queen Mother and the Queen Mother hated her.” Most people in Britain will beastonished to read this because the Queen Mother’s propaganda has turned her into thenation’s favourite grandmother. “Oh yes, the Queen Mum, such a lovely, gentle, kindold lady.” But this woman is not what she is claimed to be. I can’t emphasise thatenough. During her time at Clarence House before the wedding, Diana says herself thatshe was being given drugs like the anti-depressant, Valium, to treat her bulimia. Andwhat else were they giving her? “They drugged her”, Christine said “I’m sure of it, theyhad her doped from the start.” Christine had many conversations with Diana and sheopened her heart about her nightmare life with the Windsors. But Christine’s contactsthrough her work have given her access to other sources with inside knowledge of theBritish Royal Family, too. This was the first time she had talked publicly about herexperiences with Diana and what she knows of the reptilian agenda. She told me:“The Queen Mother... now that’s a serious piece of wizardry. The Queen Mother is a lotolder than people think. To be honest, the Royal Family hasn’t died for a long time, theyhave just metamorphosised. It’s sort of cloning, but in a different way. They take pieces offlesh and rebuild the body from one little bit. Because it’s lizard, because it’s cold-blooded,it’s much easier for them to do Frankenstein shit than it is for us. The different bodies arejust different electrical vibrations and they have got that secret, they’ve got the secret of"},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"452the micro-currents, it’s so micro, so specific, these radio waves that actually create thebodies. These are the energies I work with when I’m healing. They know the vibration of lifeand because they are cold-blooded, they are reptiles, they have no wish to make the Earththe perfect harmony it could be, or to heal the Earth from the damage that’s been done. TheEarth’s been attacked for zeons by different extraterrestrials. It’s been like a football for solong. This place was a bus stop for many different aliens. All these aliens, they could copewith everything, including the noxious gases. They’re landing all the time and coming upfrom the bowels of the Earth. They looked like reptiles originally, but they look like us whenthey get out now through the electrical vibration, that life key I talked about. They canmanifest how they want to. All the real knowledge has been taken out and shredded and putback in another way. The Queen Mother is “Chief Toad” of this part of Europe and they havepeople like her in each continent. Most people, the hangers on, don’t know, you know, aboutthe reptiles. They are just in awe of these people because they are so powerful.“Bal moral is a very, very nasty place. That’s somewhere they want to dig underground.They will find reptile fossils, it goes back that far. Don’t think of people like the QueenMother and Queen Victoria, as different people. Think of them as the same person whichafter a while has had to replace their coat. When the flesh dies, that energy, while it’sdying, will be immediately up someone else’s jacksy (backside). It’s very vampire, worsethan vampire. They are not going to come to you with hooked teeth and suck you’re blood.Fear is their food, they can actually take fear and manifest it into a tangible thing. The keyis the vibrational current. At that vibrational current, they can manifest anything fromanything. Its like a holographic image. We are all minerals and water vibrating. This is allan illusion we are living in. That’s the secret. You know when the monarchy’s faUen, it’s notthe end of it. They will manifest in another form. The reptiles have never been defeatedand this is the closest they have come to it. The reason they are so threatened today isbecause the Earth is in such trouble and the mental power of people is returning. This istheir most frightening time, but this is not going to kill them. There are long centuriesbefore it’s over yet. The difference this time is that it’ll be more difficult for them and theyare going to have to settle for less and the Earth people are going to get more. But eventhough these reptilian ones are fuckers, they are sad, pathetic beasts really, whilehumanity is galloping towards light. They’re just pathetic lumps of nastiness who aren’tgoing to win. I can’t talk about this everywhere because they would just go ‘Christine, get awhite coat, put it on backwards, get out’. But I want an end to the bullshit.”I was astonished to hear someone else talking about these subjects, which I knewfrom my own research to be true. She was not aware when she told me this of my ownresearch into reptilians. Christine Fitzgerald, thanks to her insider contacts and herknowledge of metaphysics, had been able to grasp the biggest secret: that reptiles onanother dimension are controlling the world by working through physical bodies whichlook human. And also that the Windsors are one of these reptilian bloodlines. Christinealso knew about the reptile Satanic rituals, the sexual rites and the widespread sacrifice"},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"453of children. She said it is the pure essence of the pre-pubescent the reptiles want. “If youlooked at where all the castles are built and where there are a lot of street children in theThird World, they’re galloping it at the moment. They’re pulling the kids in en massenow.” She said the reptiles want the children’s life essence because they can’t continue tomanifest without that pure energy. “The contaminated essence of us adults is not worthanything to them”, she said. “All the rituals, the knives, and sodomy, its that easy for thesepeople to snatch a piece of your soul.” Christine also spoke about the sex rituals and orgiesinvolving the Windsors. The very word orgy comes from the Greek, orgia, meaning ‘secretworship’ and relates to the sexual rites of the ancient mystery religions. Christine said:“There used to be an elect circle who took part in ritual orgies at Buckingham Palace. This wastold to me by one of the participants. They were all couples. The lights used to go out at acertain time and they all swapped round and did their things. You know about the butler ringingthe bell at six o’clock in the morning so that everyone goes back to their bed? These peopleare nasty pieces of work, sweetheart, these people are nasty. Nothing you can think of canever be as nasty as they really are. Diana used to say that if the world knew what they werereally like, they wouldn’t want them, but I knew that. My chin was on the couch now, hearingabout all these orgies at the palace. Just the laugh that these serious people who are going onlike butter wouldn’t melt up their jacksy and they are carrying on like that. But the sex thing is abig part of their rituals because it’s kundalini energy, see, which is the core, our generator. Theorgies stopped because one of the couples died and they had an odd number and they didn’twant to bring in anyone else. So even that was ritual. Everything about them is ritual... all thatheraldry, all that pomp and ceremony. Negative energy gets drawn to negative energy.”Many of the Queen’s Ladies in Waiting have told Christine Fitzgerald about PrincePhilip and his affairs. “The royal family has got lots of black babies all over the world”,she says. The recovered mind-slave Brice Taylor tells in her book, Thanks For TheMemories, how she was forced to have sex with Philip and Charles. It is not withoutreason that the former British Intelligence officer, Peter Wright, said in his controversialbook, Spycatcher, that “The palace had enjoyed several centuries of scandal burying.”Christine said that another controversial book, The Royals, by the American authorKitty Kelly was true, but “She’s left out a lot of stuff, she’s been quite kind”. She’s notkidding as you will soon appreciate. Christine told me about other members of the royalclan including Prince Philip’s uncle, Lord Mountbatten, another Satanist. She said:“Lord Mountbatten was a big shit, too. It was him who fucked up Charles and got himon the nasty road.” So this is the family which hooked an unsuspecting 19-year-old andused her, in Diana’s words, as a “brood mare” to produce Windsor heirs with Spencergenes. But it was more than that. Much more.Only a few weeks before this book went to press, and months after Christine gaveme her information in England, I was contacted by a friend in the United States whowas deprogramming a very high level mind controlled slave from Project Monarch. Hebelieves her to be the highest ranked woman in the Satanic hierarchy in the United"},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"454States and she was one of only three Mother Goddesses in the world. This is ArizonaWilder, formerly Jennifer Greene. At the time my friend and Arizona had no idea whatChristine Fitzgerald had said. Arizona had been programmed and trained sincechildhood to become a Mother Goddess who conducted Satanic rituals at the highestlevels of the Brotherhood all over the world. She described to my friend the inside ofmany secret and underground facilities that he has personally seen. What she describedwas accurate every time. He also checked her story with other contacts and the truth ofher memories was continually confirmed. What she told my friend, and later told me onaudio and video tape, supports the information supplied by other slaves and byChristine Fitzgerald about the Windsors and their true nature. Arizona said that sheofficiated at Satanic rituals at Glamis Castle in Tayside, Scotland, the childhood homeof the Queen Mother, who still owns the property, and also at Balmoral, the Queen’sScottish residence. The Brotherhood obsession with Scotland, she said, was becausethere are many entrances there into the inner-Earth where the physical reptilians live.Glamis Castle is built on the site of an 11th century royal hunting lodge and the presentbuilding dates from around 1687. It is mentioned in the ‘Shakespeare’ story of Macbeth.Arizona said that the Queen, Prince Philip, Prince Charles and Princess Anne arepresent at the rituals and so is Charles’ girlfriend, Camilla Parker-Bowles. Doesn’t it allnow start to make sense?She said that during the sacrificial rituals the Queen wears a cloak of gold fabricinlaid with rubies and black onyx. The Queen and Charles have their own ritual goblets,inlaid with precious stones signifying their Illuminati-Brotherhood rank. The MotherGoddess says that the Queen makes cruel remarks about lesser initiates, but is afraid ofthe man code-named ‘Pindar’ (the Marquis de Libeaux) who is higher than her in theSatanic hierarchy. This also supports a claim made to me by another recovered slave whosaid she had seen the Queen physically beaten by someone above her in Satanic rank.Pindar, apparently, bears a resemblance to Prince Charles and Arizona says that Pindar isCharles’ real father. She said that the sacrificial victims used in the rituals at GlamisCastle are mostly under five years of age and the ceremonies are guarded by members ofScotland’s Black Watch. She also confirmed that Lord Mountbatten was a paedophileand that the Windsors are reptilians in human form. Her interview with me was taped, aswere the ones with Christine Fitzgerald, and copies are now at various addresses. Thevideo interview with Arizona is available and details are at the back of the book. I stressthat this Mother Goddess had no idea what Christine Fitzgerald had told me and yet theirstatements match again and again. Arizona says that Diana definitely knew that theWindsors were shape-shifting reptilians and Diana’s comments to Christine Fitzgeraldsupport this. Apparently, reptilians have been seen to shape-shift during sleep. Here is asummary of just some of what Arizona said about the royal family:•••••The Queen Mother: She’s cold, cold, cold, a nasty person. None of her cohorts eventrusted her. They have named an altar (mind control programme) after her. They call it theBlack Queen. I have seen her sacrifice people. I remember her pushing a knife into"},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"455someone s rectum the night that two boys were sacrificed. One was 13 and the other 18.You need to forget that the Queen Mother appears to be a frail old woman. When sheshape-shifts into a reptilian she becomes very tall and strong. Some of them are so strongthey can rip out a heart and they all grow by several feet when they shape-shift.” (Exactlywhat the lady who saw Edward Heath said, among many others.)•••••The Queen: “I have seen her sacrifice people and eat their flesh and drink their blood.One time she got so excited with blood lust that she didn’t cut the victim’s throat from left toright in the normal ritual, she just went crazy, stabbing and ripping at the flesh after she’dshape-shifted into a reptilian. When she shape-shifts she has a long reptile face, almostlike a beak, and she’s an off-white colour. The Queen Mother looks basically the same, butthere are differences. (This description fits many depictions of the gods and ‘bird gods’ ofancient Egypt and elsewhere.) She also has like bumps on her head and her eyes are veryfrightening. She’s very aggressive.”•••••Prince Charles: “I’ve seen him shap-shift into a reptilian and do all the things the Queendoes. I have seen him sacrifice children. There is a lot of rivalry between them for who getsto eat what part of the body and who gets to absorb the victim’s last breath and steal theirsoul. I have also seen Andrew participate and I have seen Prince Philip and Charles’ sister(Anne) at the rituals, but they didn’t participate when I was there. When Andrew shape-shifts, he looks more like one of the lizards. The royals are some of the worst, OK, as faras enjoying the killing, enjoying the sacrifice, and eating the flesh, they’re some of theworst of all of them. They don’t care who sees them at the rituals, they are what they are,they show it outright. They don’t care if you see it. Who are you going to tell, who is goingto believe you? They feel that it is their birth-right and they love it. They love it.”Given the evidence I have presented in this chapter about the background to Diana’smurder, I was not surprised to hear this Mother Goddess recall the following aboutMohamed Al Fayed:“I saw Mohammed Al Fayed at a ritual at the Mothers of Darkness castle in Belgium in the1980s. The Queen and the Queen Mother were also there. The Queen Mother was talkingto him and he was looking around as if he didn’t believe this sort of thing went on. It wason December 24th at the ritual of the old king and the new king. They didn’t let him in tosee the worst of it. It was kind of like, ‘let’s introduce him into this’. But he would have seena baby being born and introduced as the new king and the sacrifice of an old man. TheQueen Mother was there, the Queen, Pindar, Rothschilds, a lot of people I don’t know anda guy named Tony Blair. He was being groomed because my understanding of it was thatpeople are picked out and groomed for certain positions. And to be considered for thosepositions you have to accept the reality and the necessity and the sovereignty of theIlluminati, and that the reptilians run the show. Tony Blair’s attitude was like ‘I belong here’.Dodi Fayed’s father seemed bothered by it, but not Tony Blair. I remember seeing himtalking to the royals about something. I have seen Blair, Al Fayed and the Royal Family atrituals at Balmoral as well.”"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"456Once you know this astonishing background, the why, who and how of Diana’smurder become crystal clear. They were all in it together and still are. Diana’s murderhad been planned for a long time, probably from birth, and it was in the 1980s, aroundthe time Al Fayed was at the Mother of Darkness castle with the royal family and TonyBlair, that the flaming torch symbol was placed on top of the Pont de L’Alma tunnel.Arizona said that Diana was a product of the multiple personality disorder programme,which she said would have started before she was five. She said Diana was also threemonths pregnant when she died. Diana would probably not have known this, she said,because the techniques the Brotherhood use often mean that the women continue tomenstruate for some months before they are officially confirmed to be pregnant.Arizona said that when she, herself, was artificially impregnated in a mind controlledstate with Pindar’s sperm, she menstruated for three months before she was told by adoctor that she was more than three months pregnant. It could have been Pindar’s childand not Dodi Fayed’s, Arizona suggested. “That is a really powerful sacrifice” she said,“to sacrifice a pregnant woman”. If Diana was, as appears highly likely, a product of themind control programme, those who plotted her murder could have ensured all that theyrequired to play out their ritual to perfection. She would have accepted the invitationfrom Al Fayed at the right time, fallen for Dodi Fayed, agreed to go to Paris for thenight and so on. She could also have been, like Arizona, impregnated artificially andhave no recollection of it. Arizona says that she knows that Diana was impregnated withPindar’s sperm in this way to conceive her son William, the blond-haired, blue-eyedbaby born on the summer solstice. And she is in no doubt that Diana was a ‘multiple’.As she said:“The things that she did with her eyes, like the eye rolling, is very, very common inmultiples. Sometimes she’d be very shy and then suddenly she’s blossoming and she’sreally social. These are the different altars (programmes) coming out, someone’s shy,someone’s not shy, someone’s angry, someone’s not angry. Then there was the weightgain and the weight loss. The bulimia and the cutting herself are all signs of a multiple.Some are told that if you feel bad about yourself or you remember something, cut yourself.To me it was real obvious with Diana. Someone with this stuff just doesn’t announce to theworld that something’s wrong, They spend their lives trying to hide it. ‘I was out groceryshopping’, or ‘I was out clothes shopping’, ‘I was taking a walk’, whatever, but you weren’t.”The recovered mind-slave Brice Taylor confirms that Diana was a ‘multiple’ in herbook, Thanks For The Memories, and she says that William and Harry are also. I thinkDodi was another, thus making it child’s play to make he and Diana ‘fall in love’. Thesymbolism of Osiris, Isis and Horus, in the Pont de UAlma tunnel that night was alsoconfirmed by Arizona. “Diana was Isis, Dodi Fayed was Osiris, and the child wasHorus. I don’t think it symbolised the birth of a child so much as the birth of an age -the Age of Horus which begins by the year 2,000. This means the New World Order, theAge of Horus, the terrible child.” She said that the foetus would have been divided"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"457among certain high ranking leaders of the Brotherhood/ Illuminati and consumed inritual. She said that from her long experience of the rituals, she was sure that parts ofDiana’s body would have been consumed also. Again I ask, is her body even on theisland at Althorp Park? It makes you wonder what Tony Blair and the Royals weredoing when they came together at Balmoral immediately after Diana’s death. Anotherpart of the ritual was that Diana was blond-haired and blue-eyed. Cathy O’Brien is thesame, so is Arizona although she had dyed her hair to break that spell when I met her.She said that even when the Elite sacrifice cats they are blond-haired and blue-eyed.There is something about that genetic structure which is fundamental to them and this isthe blood they need to survive in this dimension. At least most of the Monarch slaveshave blond hair and blue eyes. “There were no blue eyes on this planet until theextraterrestrials came”, Arizona said.Diana told Christine Fitzgerald in 1989 that they were going to kill her: “It soundedoutlandish at the time”, Christine said, “because she had the boys and they were littleand I thought, no, they need her to bring the boys up.” But there were to be manyindications that Diana was indeed in danger from the Windsors and the Brotherhood ingeneral. In the late 1980s with her marriage nothing more than a public show, Dianawas having a relationship with her personal detective, Barry Mannakee, but he died in amotorcycle ‘accident’ in 1988. By 1990, with the Gulf War threatening, Diana washaving a relationship with Captain James Hewitt. One day, about this time, she wentrushing into Christine’s healing centre in London in a terrible state. Christineremembers:“She was crying hysterically and I said ‘What’s the matter?’ You know it was dog’s diedstuff, bottom lip out, full sob. She came galloping through the door. I gave her rescueremedy, clutched her, hugged her, calmed her down, and said now tell me what’s going on.‘I can’t believe it, I can’t believe it, they killed him, they killed him’ she sobbed. I said: ‘Whodid they kill?’ She told me about her affair with the detective (Barry Mannakee) and how hewas decapitated on a motorbike and how she thought it was a terrible accident. But nowshe knows the Royal Family killed him because Prince Charles’ senior detective had justtold her that if she didn’t cool it with Hewitt, the same would happen to him. He told her sheshould not think that she was indispensable, either.”Officially, Barry Mannakee died in a ‘road crash’. How dangerous the roads seem tobe if the royals don’t like you. Christine said that Diana was very much in love withMannakee and she had visited his grave regularly. Diana had, apparently, been unawareof his death at the time until she was being driven with Prince Charles to the airport tofly to the Cannes Film Festival. He waited until she was about to get out of the car infront of waiting photographers and he said:“Oh, by the way, I got word from the Protection Unit yesterday that poor BarryMannakee was killed. Some sort of motorcycle accident. Terrible shame, isn’t it?”Diana burst into tears, but Charles said sarcastically: “Let’s go darling, your press"},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"458awaits you.”61 I would emphasise again that the confirmation that Mannakee wasmurdered, and the personal threat to Diana, came from Prince Charles’ senior detective,according to the Princess. Would he be making statements and threats to her like thatwithout the approval of Prince Charles? Of course not. In 1998 in the IndependentTelevision documentary, Diana - Secrets Of The Crash, James Hewitt said that he too hadbeen warned to stop seeing Diana or the consequences would not be pleasant. He said:“The telephone calls were anonymous, but left me in no doubt that they knew what thesituation was. They were threatening. They said it was not conducive to my health tocontinue the relationship.”He said that other warnings came from Diana’s personal police protection officers,the Royal Household, and a member of the Royal Family, whom he would not name:“The (member of the Royal Family) said your relationship is known about. It is notsupported, we cannot be responsible for your safety and security, and suggest that youcurtail it forthwith.”James Hewitt was further quoted in the London Times about these threats and hiscomments supported completely the story Diana had told Christine Fitzgerald. Hewitt saidthat his clearest warning came when he was told that he would suffer the same fate asBarry Mannakee.62 Does anyone still believe that the Windsors and their networks were notinvolved in the murder of Princess Diana? Or that they had prior knowledge and played anactive role in the decision to assassinate the mother of William and Harry? According toreports in the United States, Susan Barrantes, the mother of Sarah ‘Fergie’ Ferguson, hadbeen telling friends that she thought Diana had been murdered in the weeks before she wasdecapitated in a mysterious car crash in Argentina on September 19th 1998.63 Confidentialmail for Diana was delivered to Christine Fitzgerald and this included packages from aformer member of the elite SAS who was concerned for Diana’s safety. He was warningher of what was going on behind her back.” Half of M16 were on Diana’s side too youknow”, Christine said. One day a client, who had involvement with the security agencies,saw some of these packages being delivered. Christine described what followed:“She said I’m really worried for you, you don’t know what you’re getting involved in here.Diana’s basically mad, she’ll drop you in it, she will hang you out to dry, you’ll end up dead,your kids will end up dead, your cats, your business will be ruined. I couldn’t believe howshe was carrying on. She was so full of hate. Diana came in the next day and I gave herthe mail. I said not everyone who bows to you has your best interests at heart. I told herwhat happened and she went purple with rage. When she died, everybody came in andsaid ‘They bumped her off didn’t they?’ But that client was the only one who was outragedat the suggestion. I was checked out by M16, my phones were tapped, my house wasburgled, the royal family kept a big check on me while I was dealing with Diana.”"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"459Christine and her contacts have no doubt about what happened in Paris: “She wasbumped off, she was left to die at the roadside. Those responsible were above the eliteof the army”, she said. “It was not the ‘secret squirrels’ (British Intelligence)”, sheunderstands, “it was above that”. She said that “Mohamed Al Fayed ‘in his torturedlittle sense’ wants to be part of the reptilian power because ‘he likes all that’.” Christinebelieves that Diana’s romance with Dodi was engineered. She said:“Diana fell in love quite easily and he’s a master of the smile. She was unfortunate in herlove affairs because she rescued others in her own distress. So the men she went for wereall emotional cripples because she was a healer, too. Most people who went with Dianaused her and I think Dodi did also. He would have used her for his ego, the contacts, andhis dad. The Royal Family killed her for her light energy, especially when she waspregnant. I don’t believe she was as badly injured as they say. If they checked her bodythey would see that the scar the surgeons made starts at her pubis and goes right up toher throat. They’ve even taken her thymus gland, the way we make interstellarcommunication. I know from the best sources that she was pregnant and they took thebaby. Pieces of that foetus will have been delivered everywhere. They can make babiesfrom the cells. Parts of her body will have been used in their rituals as well. Diana wasalways having Kensington Palace swept for bugs, but they had Dodi bugged and theyknew exactly what was going on. This was not the first time she thought she was pregnantand this nearly happened before, but she wasn’t pregnant. That was with Hewitt.”Christine Fitzgerald shared the most intimate details of Diana’s life and knew her inways, and at levels, that very few others did. The incredible revelations of theWindsors’ treatment of Diana over so many years, the threats made to her by PrinceCharles’ personal detective, the ritual sacrifices and the confirmation that they wereresponsible for the murder of Barry Mannakee, cannot be allowed to pass by. Theremust be a campaign to press the Windsors to face these matters and for Al Fayed,Trevor Rees-Jones, Earl Spencer, and the others I have named, to answer the questionsthat have to be addressed. Power must be stripped from the Windsors, their royaldynasty dismantled, and their crimes against humanity publicly exposed. More thanthat, however, those in the political, security, and medical professions, who are alsoinvolved, must be equally exposed. The Royal Family, Earl Spencer, and the BritishPrime Minister, Tony Blair, have all dismissed claims that Diana was murdered andcalled for such suggestions to cease ‘for the sake of the boys’. The questions must notbe allowed to be ignored or another Brotherhood assassination will have beenachieved while those responsible go free. Earl Spencer went to the extent of issuing astatement on behalf of the Spencer family in February 1998 in which he asked: “Isthere any good in all this speculation? I ask that because there is clearly a lot of harmin it. All we, her family, ask is that Diana’s memory be respected, and that sensationalspeculation be left out of the public arena, where it undermines our aims to come toterms with her loss”. When you see the evidence presented in this chapter while people"},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"460like Earl Spencer and Tony Blair say there is no evidence of a conspiracy, what doesthat make you think? If Diana had been your sister would you not be determined to findout what happened? If you were Prime Minister when such a famous and much lovedPrincess had been killed, would you not insist that the truth be established? So whydon’t they? Diana’s relationship with her brother was less than harmonious to say theleast. When you know the background, Earl Spencer’s famous speech at her funeral canbe seen as a diatribe of hypocrisy So was his bitter condemnation of the media, in astatement after her death outside his home in Cape Town, a statement which, like AlFayed’s, fueled the belief that the paparazzi were to blame for the crash. ChristineFitzgerald said of him:“Charles Spencer is a sh it, major sh it. He’s quite a spiteful little shit, too. When Diana wasgoing through the trauma and really needed a new home, he said to her: ‘You’re not bringingyour shit down to me and mine.’ He wouldn’t even give her one of the houses. He’s not apowerful man at all. He knows he’s sniffing around something dangerous and powerful andso he’s attracted to it. Satanism goes on on the Spencer estate. Diana knew about it.”Diana had a profound affect on millions of people as we saw after her death and theydid not know the half of what she had to suffer after the Windsors sank their fangs. Inmany ways Diana was a mirror of Marilyn Monroe, used by the establishment and thencast aside and murdered. Marilyn had affairs with President Kennedy and, it seems, hisbrother, Bobby, and when she became dangerous and surplus to requirements she waskilled because of what she knew. In another of those remarkable examples ofsynchronicity there are many ‘coincidences’ that connect her life and Diana’s. Theywere both born on the first of the month and died at the age of 36 in August. They bothmarried on the 29th of the month to men twelve years older. Marilyn called herself theQueen of Diamonds and Diana the Queen of Hearts. And both were the subject of theElton John song, Candle In The Wind, which he sang at Diana’s funeral. Since ChristineFitzgerald first spoke to me the threat to destroy her business has been implemented.Suddenly the phone stopped ringing and when I met her again she was seeing as manyclients in a week as she had been in a day. This is unexplainable when you consider sheis one of Britain’s most gifted and effective healers working in the centre of London.Unexplainable, that is, unless you know the story. But she told me she is determined thetruth shall be known, whatever the authorities seek to do to her: “I don’t want a war, Ijust want an end to the bullshit”, as she puts it. Looking back on Diana’s life and theirconversations together, she says:“Poor cow, she was in a house where no-one gave a damn and it’s a terrible state ofaffairs. She was all alone in a nest of vipers. I used to just patch her up. She just found meand just came to me. I made her wait for a fortnight until I checked it out. They used to saythat I was giving her anger therapy. I didn’t. I used to just listen to her, take it all in, andthink Jesus Christ! But I didn’t think they would kill her. I can’t believe that this information"},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"461is so close to home and yet they are still managing to keep it at bay. My room is the truthroom and its a real place of safety and I don’t judge anyone on their sh it, and that’s why Ihaven’t spoken about any of this in the past. She was as screwed up as anyone, youknow, and if you are going to tell the truth, you have to tell the whole truth. She wasn’tcrazy, she was mentally and physically abused, I feel, from a little girl. Her father was anasty piece of work and her stepmother (Raine), too.“The Royal Family were very afraid. She would have taken the public away from them, shewould have taken the world from them gradually. They recognised her worth and fed offher in a psychic vampire way for a long time. All she wanted was to get married and havechildren you know, bless her little heart. She wanted to live out what she had never had.The world would have come to rights with Diana because, as fucked up as she was, shewas a light being and wherever she went she manifested love. It was amazing. The sadthing was that she didn’t know she was doing that and she needed proof of her worth andshe was looking in the wrong quarters for that. But when she tried to break away, we wentout and did normal things. She did kung fu with my husband for five years. She wanted tobe normal, to link arms and walk down the street. She knew where her heart lay. She reallyand truly did amazing things.”Diana said she could not believe how cold the Windsors were and the public had agraphic example of this in the days after her death. They stayed out of sight at Balmoralin Scotland while the people mourned Diana in their tens of millions with anunprecedented explosion of grief. Only pressure from the public through the mediaforced the Queen, kicking and screaming, to make a cold, emotionless and pathetic‘tribute’ to Diana on television the night before the funeral. Cold is a word constantlyused about the Queen, Philip, and Charles, and that’s the mental and emotional profileof the Brotherhood and its networks. Bill Cooper said that the initiates that he met in hiswork for US Naval Intelligence had “No conscience, no morals, no regrets, no feelings,no emotion”. This is precisely the same character profile as the Windsors and,according to all the people I have met who have encountered them, the character profileof the reptilians of the lower fourth dimension. There is a reason for that, of course.The people have been hoodwinked for thousands of years. Hoodwinked about theirhistory, hoodwinked about who they really are and the true nature of life. Hoodwinkedabout the true background and Agenda of those they have allowed to rule them. Howapt, therefore, that this word should also derive from Freemasonry. Dr. Albert MacKey,the 33rd degree Freemason and foremost Freemason historian of the 19th century,defined the term ‘hoodwinked’ in his Encyclopaedia of Freemasonry as: A symbol ofsecrecy, silence and darkness, in which the mysteries of our art should be preservedfrom the unhallowed gaze of the profane.The human race has indeed been hoodwinked."},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"462SOURCES1The Top 13 llluminati Bloodlines, p 89.2Ibid, p 90.3Ibid.4Ibid.5Ibid.6Ibid, p 91-2.7Ibid, p 89.8Ibid.9Secret And Suppressed, p 66.10Ibid.11Ibid, p 68.12The Top 13 llluminati Bloodlines, p 94.13Secret And Suppressed, p 80.14The Top 13 llluminati Bloodlines, p 99.15Ibid, p 102.16Secret And Suppressed, pp 19, 65, 85.17Ibid, p 66.18Ibid.19Ibid, p 6520Ibid,p69.21Andrew Morton, Diana, Her True Story (Michael O’Mara Books, London, 1992, republished asDiana: Her True Story In Her Own Words, 1997).22Ibid.23Ibid.24The London Daily Mail, Thursday, August 27th 1998.25Ibid.26Diana: Her True Story27Ibid.28Ibid.29Private Eye magazine, No 956, Friday, August 7th 1998, p 5.30Tom Bower, Fayed, The Unauthodsed Biography (Macmillan, London, 1998).31Ibid, p 22.32The London Daily Mail, Friday, June 26th 1998.33Simon Reagan, Who Killed Diana?

They are casting a spell on the human mind and emotions.This has been going on for thousands of years and it is so important to understand thisif we are going to break free from reptilian control - as we are.Everything that exists is an energy field, a unique vibrational pattern of energycreated by thought and emotion. All that exists is the same energy, but these infinitepatterns create infinite forms, just as water can manifest as liquid, clouds, steam andice. They look and feel very different, but they are still water in different forms. Someenergy patterns manifest as the human body, others the human mind, still others thebirds, trees, insects, water, sky and air. At the level of pure energy everything isconnec-ted to everything else. There is no us and them, only we and ultimately ‘I’.Potentially we have the ability to access all other energy and, as energy and conscious-ness are the same, the ability to access all consciousness, the infinite mind we call‘God’. This ‘God’ is not apart from us, it is us and we are it. We are an aspect of theinfinite mind - as are the reptilians and all that exists - and therefore we have thepotential to tap into all of the infinite mind because, at our highest expression, that iswhat we all are. Everything. We are like droplets in an infinite ocean, individual to anextent, but toget-her we make the whole, the sum total of droplets. Without thedroplets there can be no ocean. The question, however, is this: How much of this oceanare we connecting with? If it is a tiny fraction you will live in a cocoon, an egg shell asI call it, delinked from your infinite potential for knowledge, love, understanding andwisdom (see Figure 54). You will live a predictable life dominated by worry and fearand believe that you are ordinary and powerless to control your own destiny. If youopen your mind and open your heart and break out of that cocoon you connect withmore and more of infinity and, in doing so, you understand that you are more than aphysical body experiencing one meaningless lifetime. You are infinite consciousnessexperien-cing this world as part of your eternal journey of evolution throughexperience (see Figure 55). You are everything and you have the potential to knoweverything and do everything.Now which one of those two states of being is more easy to control? Of course theanswer is obvious and this explains so much about the world we have seen throughoutknown human history. This is why the knowledge of who we really are has beensystematically destroyed in the public arena. Humans who understand their true nature,"},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"465power and worth would be impossible to manipulate in the ways we have seen. Only bydelinking humanity from this knowledge has it been possible to orchestrate thereptilian-Brotherhood Agenda over thousands of years. The creation of religion andofficial ‘science’ has been fundamental to that and, as we have seen, the same secretsociety streams were responsible for establishing both. The individualisation of theconcept of ‘God’ into a man, a physical form, has suppressed the understanding thateverything is God. So much so that to say you are God is to invite enormous ridicule orcondemnation, as I know myself when I spoke very publicly of such things in Britain inthe early 1990s. It has become a blasphemy to say what you are, what we all are. Forthose who will not buy a religion, we have this-world-is-all-there is science whichdenies the very existence of the infinity and eternal nature of life. The Brotherhood planhas been to so programme and manipulate humanity’s perception of itself and Creationthat we disconnect from our multidimensional infinity and operate on a tiny fraction ofour potential. But the reptilians are also an expression of the Infinite and they areoffering us an experience that we can use to evolve, just as those challenging thereptilian control are offering them an experience. Humans are learning what happenswhen they give their power away and this reptilian group are about to learn theconsequences of abusing power. It is a game in the end, a game called evolution,learning to master our mind and emotions. What I have been describing in this book isan evolutionary experience for all parties concerned. We all make decisions and choicesand face the consequences of them. Those consequences are what we are experiencingFigure 54: Imprisonment.Figure 55: Freedom."},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"466now. If we make new choices, we will create different consequences. We are in controlof our destiny, and people are waking up to that.The reptilians manipulate from the lower fourth dimension, the so-called lower astralfrequency range. To control this planet they have to keep the mass of humanity at orbelow that level and disconnect them from anything higher (see Figure 56). When thisis understood, what has happened in the world and is still happening, again makesperfect sense. Crucial to maintaining the human psyche in disconnected ignorance is themanipulation of low vibrational emotion, fear, guilt, resentment, dislike of self andcondemnation of others which, in the end, are all expressions of fear. These are the veryemotions which resonate to the frequency range of the lower fourth dimension and oncewe succumb to domination by these emotions we succumb to the control of the reptilianconsciousness. Notice that I said domination. Feeling these emotions as part of the lifeexperience is fine. This is important in our evolution to greater understanding andwisdom. It is when these emotions control you that the whole focus of your psychebecomes plugged into the lower fourth dimension to such an extent that the reptilianconsciousness can connect and infiltrate your thought patterns. So the Brotherhood usehorrific Satanic rituals and sacrifice to synchronise their initiates with the reptilianwavelengths. They also seek tostimulate the character traits ofour R-complex, the reptilianpart of our brain, whichmanifest as aggression,ritualism, a desire forhier-archical structure, and soon.What I am suggesting hereabout the nature of life is notsome theory. It can be proved.Scientists and researchers in theUnited States have shown thatthe emotion of fear resonates alow vibrational pattern, a longwavelength, while the emotionwe call love resonates a highvibrational pattern, a shortwavelength. This is extremelysignificant for this reason, asthe author, researcher andarchaeologist Gregg Bradenshows in his video, AwakeningTo Zero Point,1 the geneticmaterial of the human body is aFigure 56: The reptilians have imprisoned so much of humanconsciousness within the lower fourth dimensional prison of fear,guilt, and frustration. Only by opening our hearts and minds can weescape and reconnect with our infinite self. Love is the answer."},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"467highly sophisticated transmitter and receiver of frequencies. Experiments have shownthat when you place a piece of DNA, the body’s genetic blueprint, in a tube ofelectrons, the electrons form themselves together in the pattern of the DNA. When youremove the DNA, the electrons still hold the same pattern. In other words, the DNA isconstantly affecting the energy around us. Our state of being affects the world secondby second. When you change your attitudes and state of being you change the wholebecause you are part of the whole, indeed you are the whole. Still feeling ordinary andpowerless? We have within us a series of micro-antenna called amino acids whichinteract with the DNA and, according to Braden, there are 64 potential human geneticcodes or antenna to transmit and receive frequencies. In short, a potential 64 antenna toconnect us with higher frequencies and higher dimensions of ourselves. But, he says,only 20 are activated while 44 remain ‘switched off’. This means that our ability toconnect with our full power, wisdom and potential is massively undermined. No doubtthe fact that we use only a fraction of our brain’s potential is a consequence of this also.Research by the Institute of HeartMath and others in the United States has furthershown that these ‘antenna’ on the DNA are activated or closed down by thewavelengths of emotion which constantly pass through the DNA. The emotion of fear(from which all negative emotion derives) is a long, slow wavelength and so can onlytrigger a few of our potential antennas (see Figure 57). But love (from which allpositive emotion derives) is a fast, short wavelength and so sparks into action far moreof these antennas (see Figure 58). Thus when we are under the spell of fear we delinkourselves from our true connection to infinity and live our lives within a small dropletof consciousness, the egg shell. When we express the emotion of love we reconnectwith our multidimensional self and our potential becomes infinite because we becomeinfinite. We reconnect with the ocean, with ‘God’.There is another way of putting this. Our consciousness is a series of interconnectingenergy fields. We have our intellect, emotions, spirit and so on, all resonating todifferent frequencies, but interpenetrating each other through a series of vortices knownFigure 57: Fear is along, slow wavelengthand activates very few ofour DNA ‘antennas’which connect us withthe Cosmos.Figure 58: Love is ashort, fast wavelengthwhich activates manymore antennas andreconnects us with allthat is."},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"468as chakras, a Sanskrit wordmeaning ‘wheels of light’. As Imentioned earlier, it is throughthese chakra vortices thatemotional imbalances are passedto the mental level and, if itcontinues, to the physical level.This is how stress causes illnessand why we stop thinking straightwhen we are emotionally upset.The seven main chakras areplaced between the bottom of thespine and the top of the head as inFigure 59. The lower threeconnect us to the Earth and thetop three connect us to the spirit,the ‘ocean’. In an ideal state, ahuman being is the connectionbetween the physical and thespiritual: Heaven and Earth. Thebalance point in the chakrasystem is the heart chakra fromwhich we express the emotion oflove or hatred, the highest andlowest expressions of thischakra’s frequency range. This is the origin behind the symbolism of the heart and love.Today love is associated with the physical heart, but it is really the spiritual heart, theheart chakra, that was the inspiration for this symbolism. When you are expressing lovein its true and purest sense, unconditional, non-judgemental love, as we call it, thatheart chakra opens like a flower and spins very quickly with enormous power. Flowerpower! This resonates your whole lower consciousness to the frequency of pure loveand, in doing so, reconnects you with your higher dimensions which resonate to thatlove frequency. I don’t care who you are or what you have done, your soul is pure love.I don’t care if you are a reptilian on another dimension, the Queen of England, GeorgeBush, Henry Kissinger, whoever, your soul is pure love. What has happened, however,is that their lower consciousness has become delinked from that highest level ofthemselves and once that happens the lower cons-ciousness can do some unbelievablyhorrendous things. But how can they reconnect with their true self -pure love - whilethey are resonating such hatred? They can’t. As with all of us, the only way toreconnect with pure love is to express and live pure love. To do that, of course, theymust give up their desire to control and dominate because while they continue with thatAgenda they will stay isolated from their infinite selves.Figure 59:The chakra systemCrown chakraThird eye chakraThroat chakraHeart chakraSolar plexuschakraSacral chakraBase chakra"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"469Instead, they have sought to manipulate humanity into an even lower range ofconsciousness. The reptilians and other lower fourth dimensional entities are in aconsciousness prison themselves and they want humanity to live in a smaller one.Interestingly, the Dutch surrealist painter, M. C. Escher, depicts reptiles trapped in aprison of time and space as you can see in Figure 60. That is the situation, I feel, anduntil they change they will remain in jail, unable to evolve into infinity. Their aim is tokeep us in there with them. The reptilian method for achieving this over these thousandsof years has been, not surprisingly in the wake of this evidence, through the emotion offear. The constant wars, conflicts, terrorist outrages, financial worries and the countlessother negative events engineered by the Brotherhood have been designed overwhel-mingly to maintain humanity in a state of fear, therefore limited and disconnected fromits true self. The encouragement of hatred, resentment, revenge, and condemnation (allmanifestations of fear) have not only added to this, they have ensured the conditions forfurther conflict and fear. Still more fear, in unimaginable amounts, has been stimulatedby religion. The fear of God (fear of self) and the fear of death and ‘his’ judgement. It isthe same with ‘science’ and the fear of dying and going to oblivion. Humanity isconsumed and overwhelmed byfear and its multifacetedexpressions and that’s why weare delinked from who we are.The Babylonian Brotherhoodhas made sure we haveremained ignorant of this bycontrolling what is taught inschools and universities, theinstitutions of ‘science’ and,therefore, what the media con-siders possible and credible inits arrogant and pathetic dismis-sal of anything which challengesthe ‘norm.

Thereptilians need love more than anyone."},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"470they give their power away to anyone they believe will protect them. The technique Icall problem-reaction-solution is the manipulation of fear. It is fear, and its offshootslike resentment, which stimulates the calls for “Something must be done” after wars andother outrages which then leads to the Brotherhood frontmen offering their solutions.What we are talking about here is mass mind and emotional control. If you take thedefinition of mind control to be manipulating a person’s mind so they think and act inways that you want, how many people on Planet Earth today are not mind controlled?The deaths of President Kennedy and Princess Diana were part of this. Whatever peoplesay about the true character of JFK, the perception was that he represented a new hopefor the future. Whether he did or not doesn’t matter. People thought he did and so that iswhat he represented to them. As many Americans have told me over the years,something died in the American psyche when he was murdered. Call it hope, innocence,whatever you like. Something deep in the spirit of America died with him. Theunderlying feeling was that the good die young and evil always seems to win. It was thesame with Diana, the lady associated, quite rightly in this case, with the genuineexpression of love. When she died that wave of emotion which followed was not somuch for her, the human being, it was for her, the symbol of love. The mass outpouringof grief was, if you look below the surface, the grief that something else had died withher. Love had died. Goodness had died. The good die young and evil always wins.These are just two global examples of the mass psyche being manipulated into a senseof powerlessness and despair by the mind doctors of the Brotherhood at places like theTavistock network in London. People in a state of fear, powerlessness and despaireventually switch off and become the sheep they are encouraged to be, drifting throughtheir lives in numb subservience.But the manipulation of the human mind and emotions, and the disconnection fromthe infinite ocean, goes much, much, deeper than this. Remember that while thereptilians of the lower fourth dimension are spiritually and emotionally unplugged, theyare very mentally sharp and come from a high level of intellectual knowledge. Thisknowledge has been hoarded in the Brotherhood secret society network since theancient world while being sucked out of the public domain by the destruction of nativecultures, the horrors of the Inquisition, and the burning of great esoteric libraries likethe one in Alexandria. Balance = harmony. Imbalance = disharmony. If you want dis-harmony you need imbalance. It is a simple fact and this has played a fundamental partin the Brotherhood’s techniques. The balanced female energy is the energy of intuitionand reconnection. This is where the idea of a ‘woman’s intuition’ comes from. A femalebody is far more likely to manifest female energy in abundance and so most of theoracles, channellers and psychics in the ancient and modern world have tended to bewomen. But they don’t have to be. Men are just as capable of accessing their femalepolarity and using this creative force to connect with higher, intuitive levels of them-selves. But such a reconnection is not what the Brotherhood has wanted to see. Theywant humanity to stay in the consciousness prison. So they have done all they can tosuppress the use of the balanced female energy. They used religion to make women"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"471servile to men with no opportunity to express themselves in their full glory. At the sametime they suppressed the female polarity in the male by creating the blueprint for what aman should be. Macho and aggressive is what we call a ‘real’ man (a lost and frightenedlittle boy, in truth). These ‘real’ men were and are so delinked from their female energythat their intuition and connection with their higher selves is all but extinguished.Meanwhile the Brotherhood initiates have been using the negative frequencies of thefemale energy (Hecate) to connect with their reptilian masters on the lower fourthdimension and to manipulate the world secretly from behind the movie screen. Thesuppression and perversion of sexual energy, the creative force, is another fundamentalmeans of limiting human potential to manifest their infinite power for creativity and self-determination.Interconnected with the manipulation of the female energy is the manipulation oftime. This is another aspect of the symbolism in the Pont de UAlma Tunnel. TheBrotherhood has tuned the human consciousness into a false perspective of time and indoing so they have disconnected humanity from the rest of creation which operates on adifferent version of time. Thus humanity is living its life out of sync with the universe.No wonder there’s so much imbalance. In truth there is no time. Everything just is andpast, present and future are happening at once. It is only our perception of time that makeevents appear to be happening in a linear time line. But even in linear time, we have beenunplugged from the natural flow. Nature is tuned to Moon time, the 28-day 13 cycles ofthe Moon. The woman’s menstrual cycle is tuned to the Moon and, appropriately, it is theMoon which takes the male solar energy and reflects it back at the Earth in a femaleform. The Satanists have their rituals and sacrifices every month under the full Moonwhen that female energy is at the peak of its power. They take this energy and manifestits negative polarity: Hecate. The more negative female (intuitive) energy they can focus,the more powerful their connection with the ‘demons’ they seek to access and communi-cate with on other dimensions. This is why they programme sensitive psychics likeArizona Wilder to conduct their rituals. The native peoples of the world who still live byMoon time are far more in tune with nature because they are operating on the same time-energy flow as nature. They are in sync with it. But in 1572 Pope Gregory announcedthat a new calendar was to be introduced, the Gregorian Calendar, and it was implemen-ted in October 1582. It was another Brotherhood scam and the Gregorian Calendarbecame the fixed standard time for the planet. This means that the human mind is tunedto this manufactured flow of ‘time’ when we look at a clock, a watch, or plan the futurewith a diary And where is the centre of this time system, the zero point from which allthe world’s people tune their timepieces? Why, it’s only Greenwich in London, acrossthe River Thames from the City of London financial district, the Brotherhood’s opera-tional heartland! And what was the inspiration for the Gregorian Calendar? The one usedin... Babylon. The ancient Greek name for the Watchers or sons of the gods who inter-bred with the daughters of men was Grigori.2 It is the calendar of the Grigori, the reptilians.It was the reptile-Brotherhood priests of Babylon who played the same game withtime all those thousands of years ago. The Gregorian Calendar is a farce. It is the time"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"472equivalent of throwing all your clothes in a wardrobe and leaning against the door to stopit flinging open. The clothes may just about fit in the space if you push them in hardenough, but what a mess. Here we have a 12 month year of 60 minute hours and 24 hourdays with the months so ill-fitting that some are 30 days, others 31, another 28, or 29every four years. Yes, fits like a glove. But a sensible measurement of time was not themotivation. Disconnecting human consciousness from Moon time was the idea and theGregorian Calendar removed the 13th Moon. There should be 13 Moon-cycle months of28 days, but instead we have 12 months and 12 Moon cycles. The Brotherhood hierarchystill operate their calendars to Moon time - another reason for their obsession with 13.Crashing the car of Diana (the Moon Goddess) into the 13th pillar was also symbolic ofthis removal of the 13th Moon from the human perception of time. And when youdisconnect people from the natural flow of time, you are disconnecting them from all thatoperates in that flow of time. Thus the Western (and increasingly global) ‘civilisation’ haslost its rapport with the natural world and is out of sync with its environment.The Millennium is a manufactured point in time. The moment at which theMillennium is crossed to the year 2000 only exists because of the Gregorian Calendar,but as the human psyche is tuned to that, the Brotherhood is again planning tomanipulate time across the Millennium. As the Millennium approached, the tallestbuilding in Europe was built across the River Thames from the Greenwich Observatoryin London, the zero point of so-called Greenwich Mean Time. This building, namedCanary Wharf, was built by a consortium of Brotherhood business interesfs and it is anenormous glass obelisk. Later the British Government decided to spend the best part ofa billion, yes a billion, pounds to build a vast dome, the Millennium Dome, which willbe the focus of official celebration at the time of the Millennium. This dome is besidethe River Thames and on the opposite side, close to the global zero time line, is theCanary Wharf obelisk (see picture section). The obelisk and the dome are both premierBrotherhood geometric symbols which draw in solar and cosmic energy. The man incharge of the Millennium Dome project was Peter Mandelson, the man dubbed ‘thePrince of Darkness’ who was forced to resign after revelations about his personalfinances. It was Mandelson who was the Labour Party’s chief spin doctor when theyintroduced the red rose as the party symbol.I am sure that in some way the Brotherhood plan to ‘flick’ time at this zero point atGreenwich to further scramble human consciousness and stimulate still more imbalanceand conflict. The symbol for the Millennium Dome is a naked, long-legged womanreaching for the Sun as dawn breaks over the Greenwich Meridian. It has been dubbed‘New Britannia’ and is said to represent ‘female icons from prehistory to the presentday’. Icons or one icon, Queen Semiramis, under different names? The artist was paid£90,000 from the National Lottery fund for his efforts. Playing with time is a majorBrotherhood weapon against human consciousness. I am sure there were also originally13 astrological signs too, and that the 13th was represented by the spider. This sign, Ifeel, was one which encompassed all the others - weaving together their variousenergies and I always see it as located in the centre of the astrological circle."},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"473Interestingly at Bohemian Grove their Shakespearean (Francis Bacon) motto is:“Weaving spiders come not here”All is consciousness in different manifestations and we are interacting with othervibrating energy fields every moment of our lives. We often feel this when we meetsomeone and feel their ‘vibes’ or we go to a house and either feel uncomfortable orimmediately at home. It is the energy of the person or place that we are feeling. As weare living within the energy fields of the Earth we are constantly affected by theirvibrational state. The reptilian-Brotherhood know this and here you have another reasonfor their symbolism and ritual on such an apparently obsessional scale. Everythingresonates at a frequency and symbols are very powerful examples of this. A symbol is aphysical representation of a thought. What that symbol means to you is the energy itwill resonate. An obelisk symbolises male sexual energy, the phallus, and so that is theenergy it generates and attracts. The dome represents the womb, the female, and that isthe energy it generates and attracts. The same with a pentagram, a lighted torch,whatever. If they are placed in particularly powerful vortex points and crossover pointson the Earth’s magnetic grids, they will affect the vibrational state of the global energyfield even more efficiently. So it is with the geometrical street plans and the geometricalplacement of certain buildings in relation to each other. The assassination of PresidentKennedy in a powerful vortex point like Dealey Plaza, and the human thought energy ofhorror, grief and fear focused on there, will have had a massive effect on the vibrationalresonance of the Earth energy. The same, even more so, with the death of Diana on thatMoon-energy site in Paris. This is all part df the spell cast by the reptilians on thehuman mind and emotions to delink us from our true and infinite power. Also the morenegative emotion we can be manipulated to feel by these and other events, the more wegenerate our own fear into the Earth fields and the downward spiral goes on.There is another point here which is highly relevant to the next section. Research hasshown that there is a pulse, an electrical signal, which is generated from the centre ofthe Milky Way Galaxy to our Sun (and other suns) and from there to the Earth. Thispulse is then picked up by the human heart, passed onto the brain, and goes out fromthere to the cells of the body. When that pulse, that resonance, is passed through thatsequence intact and unbroken the human being is at one with the cosmos. Every cell isconnected to, and in harmony with, the cosmic pulse. What gets in the way, however, islow vibrational emotion and imbalance which breaks the circuit and, once again,disconnects us from the Earth and the wider universe. The heart-brain connection hasbeen broken in most people by the separation of the head and the heart, the intellect andthe intuition, the physical and the spiritual. The reason the reptilian-Brotherhood ispressing forward with its Agenda so quickly today is that it knows it has a colossalchallenge on its hands. Creation is governed by energy cycles. At one level we see themwith the Earth seasons, spring, summer, autumn and winter. But there are much biggercycles, too, and these have been recorded in numbers and symbols by the ancients likethe Sumerians, Egyptians, Hindus, Chinese, the Maya of Central America and theNative Americans like the Hopi of Arizona. These measure the cycles of solar, lunar and"},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"474other cosmic energies which transform the Earth’s energy fields and so transform life onthis planet. We are now in the midst of perhaps the greatest of these transformativecycles, one which happens, it is estimated, only once every 26,000 years, and the Mayacalendar predicts that the critical changeover point is December 12th 2012. This is thereal focal point of the transformation, not the manufactured Millennium. Theseconsciousness cycles are like doorways or gateways which open for those who areready to move through into a much higher state of consciousness. I see it as a sort ofcuckoo clock in which, at certain key moments in time (or rather cycles), the door orgateway opens. When these gateways are missed, the cycle begins again until anothergateway opens. But what we are facing now, it would seem, is not so much a gatewayas a vast chasm of opportunity for a global transformation that will defy all currentbelief. Religious and mystery school texts have been openly or symbolically predictingthis for thousands of years. Now the physical, spiritual and, increasingly, scientificevidence is there to confirm that the so-called ‘Great Shift of the Ages’ is upon us.A series of events, described by Gregg Braden in Awakening To Zero Point, haveconfirmed that the times they are a changing. In 1991 a new frequency was identifiedresonating from the centre of the spiral of our Milky Way Galaxy and in 1994 the UlyssesProbe was sent to investigate changes on the Sun. From the mid-1980s there was a terrificincrease in solar flares and X-ray bursts, and Ulysses discovered that the Sun’s magneticfield was rapidly decreasing. The readings at the north and south poles and at the equatorwere ‘much lower than expected. Also, while the Sun is cooling, the planets of the solarsystem, especially the outer ones, are heating up. This suggests that the source ofplanetary heat comes from within, although this may be stimulated by magnetic andelectrical changes in the Sun. At the same time these changes were happening on the Sun,a storm on Jupiter, first documented by the Chinese 3,000 years ago, showed suddenchanges also. A vast spiral within this Jupiter storm began to spin in the other direction.The shock waves and other phenomena caused by the collision of the comet Shoemaker-Levy into Jupiter in 1994 have also affected the wider solar system, including the Earth.What is clear is that the changes in the Sun’s magnetic field have been mirrored here.The Earth is a giant magnet with different levels rotating to create a magnetic field.The faster the Earth rotates, the more powerful and dense the magnetic field. Twothousand years ago this magnetic field reached the peak of its intensity in the currentcycle and it has been falling ever since as the planet has rotated slower and slower,Braden says. The field is now 50% less powerful than it was 1,500 years ago and thespeed of this fall is increasing very quickly. There is no need to panic because this is allpart of a natural cycle, a longer and infinitely more powerful version of the annualseasons. Alongside this comes the news that the Earth’s resonant frequency, it’s heartbeat if you like, is increasing rapidly. This frequency, called the Base ResonantFrequency or Schumann Cavity Resonance, was identified in 1899. Between then andthe mid-1980s, it maintained a constant pulse of around 7.8 Hertz or 7 cycles persecond. But from 1986-87 it apparently began to quicken. By the end of 1995 it hadreached 8.6 according to some estimates and the last I heard it was said to be above ten"},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"475and still rising. Gregg Braden believes that by the Maya transformation year of 2012,the Earth’s resonance could be 13 cycles per second while her magnetic field could beat or near zero. He calls this Zero Point when the Earth’s magnetic field will all butdisappear because the planet’s rotation will have stopped. This doesn’t mean there willbe no gravity because that is created by other phenomena, not the spin of the planet.Something like this seems to have happened at least 14 times in the last 4.5 millionyears. The last is estimated to have been about 11-13,000 years ago, a window of timewhich corresponds with many estimates of the end of Atlantis and the beginning of therecovery from that great cataclysm after about 10,500 BC. 13,000 years ago would havebeen the halfway point in the Great Cycle of 26,000 years which is ending now, anothertime of great change. I am not saying the Earth is going to stop rotating, but I certainlywould not dismiss the possibilityIt could be, however, that there was a magnetic pole shift more recently, about 3,500-600 years ago from examination of the ice in Greenland and the polar regions. Everytime the Earth has experienced the rapid fall in the magnetic field that we are seeing now,it has led to a pole shift when magnetic north and south change places. People likeBraden estimate that the Earth will stop rotating for some days before it begins to spin inthe opposite direction. As you can see when the flow of electricity through an iron bar isreversed, the poles reverse. As the planet spins in the other direction, the flow ofelectricity will reverse and so, therefore, must the poles. If the planet stopped rotating,one side of the Earth would be in constant sunshine and the other in darkness in thisperiod and that is what the ancients said happened thousands of years ago. The Peruvianstalked about the ‘long night’ of three days and in the Bible there is reference to daytimelasting 20 hours, the longest day. The Hopi Tribe record how the Sun rose twice in oneday. First it rose in the west and set in the east and then later it rose in the east and set inthe west - the cycle ever since. Other ancient accounts say the Sun used to rise in thewest and set in the east, another indication that the Earth used to spin the other way.Back in the early 1990s when I was just waking up to these things, I was given somechannelled information by a psychic which said: “The world is changing and the northwill become south and the east, west. So it has been commanded since the beginning oftime.”3 Spot on, it would seem. Brian Desborough, the scientist-researcher in California,also told me that some major geophysical events are happening which are subject to amedia blackout. He confirms that the Earth’s geomagnetic field is dropping at anexponential rate and will soon reach zero. He believes, as I do, that we are, to say theleast, in for a very bumpy ride geologically. The US Geological Service says that theEarth’s magnetic field drops to zero every 500,000 years, then slowly rebuilds, and thatthese are periods of cataclysmic Earth changes, earthquakes and volcanoes, because ofthe temporary halt in the planet’s rotation. I think it happens more often than that.According to Brian’s contacts, the Sun’s magnetic field has already dropped to zero andit appears to have reached a higher level of conversion of hydrogen to helium. He saysthat solar flares are being emitted above and below the Sun’s equator at a latitude of 19.5degrees. This is the point where energy is exchanged between rotating spheres and it is"},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"476at this latitude on the Earth that the pyramids are located. The energy being receivedfrom the Sun at these latitudes must now be phenomenal.We have followed the connection between changes in the resonance from the centre ofthe galaxy, to changes in the Sun, to changes in the Earth. It goes on from there to thehuman heart, then the brain and to every cell in the body The more you open your heart themore powerful this flow and the quicker you will synchronise with the rising vibrationsand transform into a higher state of consciousness. If you close your heart and close yourmind, you will be resisting these changes and more and more of your energy will be spentfighting the very energies that will transform your life and set you free. Also, your bodywill get increasingly out of sync with the energy around you and the consequences,mentally, emotionally and physically will be obvious. You can stand in this fast flowingriver trying to hold it back, or you can relax, lie on the air bed and flow with it. It is yourchoice and whatever happens you live forever. If we allow ourselves to be infused by thishigh frequency light, our bodies will repair themselves and we will not age. We will live inphysical bodies indefinitely if we wish to and our mental and psychic powers will know nobounds, no limitations. If it is also correct that we are entering a massive electrical fieldcalled a Photon Belt we are going to experience some amazing things. The ancients knewof these great cycles of change and all the ancient calendars of the Egyptians, Maya,Tibetans, Chinese and others end in the period we are living through now. That Egyptiancalendar dates back some 39,000 years and the Mayan one perhaps 18,000. The Maya saidthat there would be a transition period between the old world and the new as one version oftime was replaced by another. They called this period ‘No Time’ and they said this wouldbegin in July 1982 and lead to the shift on December 12th 2012. The effect of all this onhumanity is easy to see. I have visited more than 20 countries in the last few years andthere is an awakening unfolding in all of them. Not yet the majority by any means, but thenumbers are gathering by the day as this spiritual alarm clock awakens people from theirslumber. It is the quickening vibration of the Earth, and indeed the galaxy in general,which is giving the impression that time is passing faster and faster. This is an illusionbecause there is no time, in truth, but it feels that way because the frequency is gettingfaster. I remember I was given a channelled communication through a psychic in the early1990s which said that the day was coming when time would seem to be moving so quicklyit would be frightening. That moment is near. It’s nothing to worry about, just a naturalcycle, but it will present many challenges and therefore infinite opportunities.The universe, like the whole of the physical world, is a hologram - beams of lightcolliding to create the appearance of three-dimensional form. It is like throwingstones into a pond and watching the waves collide and create patterns. Two scientistsin the United States, Terrance and Dennis McKenna, suggest that the universe is ahologram of 64 waves or time scales and this is why we have the 64 hexagrams ofthe 1-Ching, 64 keys of the Tree of Life, and the 64 codons of the DNA. Theircomputer analysis suggests that all 64 of these waves are going to peak together in2012. This is going to make the next few years a period of staggering change. TheMcKennas’ say that the speed of change has gone on doubling in a smaller and"},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"477smaller time frame, manifesting as the leaps in technological development in thiscentury. Projecting forward they say that this will continue to the transformation year of2012 when in a period of 384 days there will be more transformations of consciousnessthan in all the previous cycles put together. After this there will be a six day cycle inwhich events will move even faster and in the last 135 minutes there will be eighteenfurther enormous leaps in human consciousness, culminating’ in the last .0075 of asecond when another 13 will occur. I don’t think we’ll be watching The Price Is Rightwhile this is happening somehow. “I say dear, I think I’ve just gone though a number oflife-changing transformations while that last advert was on. Cup of tea?”As I write these words the cycle of solar flares is increasing rapidly and heading formaximum power and effect between 1999 and 2002 (see Figure 61). This is not thetransformation, but it is part of the gathering cycle. A good source of information onthese subjects is the Solar Web Site.4 It is significant that the solar cult of the reptilian-humans should create a measurement of time which synchronised their year 2,000 withthe maximum burst of solar flares in this cycle (cycle 23 as it is known). These solarstorms of highly charged energy are likely to increase thunderstorm activity, weatherchanges, incredible auroral displays in the sky and, possibly, cause widespread powercuts and satellite malfunctions. The underground bases and cities built by the Elite inthis century are in preparation for the monumental changes that are going to occurbetween now and 2012. The Telstar 401 satellite was destroyed by, apparently, higherthan normal electron densities and they were nothing compared with what is to come. InMarch 1989 the electrical grid in Quebec, Canada collapsed within two minutes amid asimilar storm of solar energy and, again, far greater storms are now expected. Themaximum years for major geomagnetic storms is projected to peak between 1999 and2002; severe storms should peak between 1999 and 2005; and the year for themaximum number of minor storm days is predicted to be 2005 as solar cycle 23 goesinto decline.5 The biggest solar flares of this solar cycle are reckoned to be 10,000 timesmore powerful than those observed in the mid-1990s.6Figure 61: The dramatic increase in solar flares which will be bombarding the Earth across the Millenniumyears. These figures are the numbers of major flares in each month."},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"478The Brotherhood have technology to mess with the weather and they use it, no doubtabout that. But the phenomena I have described in this chapter are the real reason forthe dramatic changes in global weather patterns which are becoming more extreme bythe month. We have seen nothing yet. As I said, amid great public ridicule in Britain inthe early 1990s, enormous changes in climate patterns and extremes of weather arelikely in this period, along with geological effects as the Earth restructures herself andprepares her body for the shift in the same way that humans are having to do. We andthe Earth are being challenged to synchronise our consciousness and its physicalexpression with the rapidly accelerating frequencies now bathing the planet. TheBrotherhood are seeking desperately to hide these facts by blaming the weather changeson the ‘Greenhouse Effect’ or ‘El Nino’. They know that once people realise thatsomething very different is happening the dominoes will fall and the game will be up. Itwas the Brotherhood who created the New Age Movement to divert the awakening. Theterm New Age is the name of a Freemasonic magazine. A mind controlled slave of theAmerican Government, now recovering, confirmed to me that the New Age waslaunched covertly by Henry Kissinger and others while she was under his control in the1970s. Whenever I have made these points, New Agers have dismissed the ideabecause, they say, the Brotherhood would not want the people to encompass a differentview of life. No, not in an ideal world they wouldn’t, but this is not an ideal world forthem because the energy changes are waking people up. The Brotherhood knew thiswas coming and what its affect would be. They couldn’t jump in a spacecraft and fiddlewith the Sun or go into the centre of the galaxy to switch off the new vibration. Theironly alternative was to hijack the awakening consciousness and lead it into another cul-de-sac, another rules-and-regulations-religion, where it would be no threat to theBrotherhood Agenda. This they have done with the New Age Movement. There aresome very sensible and aware people within the New Age doing some great work, butso many others are in denial of what is going on in the world. They are being misled byother dimensional entities, Brotherhood transmissions on the psychic frequencies andchannelled communications from the lower fourth dimension. They sit around theircandles or wait for an extraterrestrial ‘Ashtar Command’ to come and whisk them offthe planet in a spaceship. Ashtar is a Brotherhood concoction and a play on words withancient deities like Ashteroth and Ishtar, another name for Queen Semiramis. Much ofthe New Age mentality will not even talk about the Brotherhood manipulation because‘it’s negative’. Yes it is and it will stay that way until we acknowledge it and change it.Running away or hovering near the ceiling won’t make a difference. So much of theNew Age is not spirituality as change, but spirituality as escapism. It is suppressing anddiverting the awakening, not advancing it.We are clearly being prepared for revelations about the reptilians, because the highlycharged, higher frequency energies will increase dramatically the number of peoplewho see the reptilians of the lower fourth dimension. Arizona Wilder told me that thenumber of sacrificial rituals has increased massively since the 1980s because thereptilians need more and more human blood and energy to hold their human form. They"},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"479need the microchipped control in place before they are seen openly as reptiles as thevibrational changes advance. The changes are taking away the reptilians’ vibrationalcover and the truth has to come out. In preparation for this there is a very long list ofmovies and television programmes for adults and children about reptile humanoids,friendly and otherwise. I have mentioned The Arrival and V: The Final Battle, but thereare many more. In Stargate, the story of time-travelling to an ancient Egypt controlledby extraterrestrials, the possible reptile nature of the ‘alien’ is revealed when his skin isripped away at the end. Stargate: SG-1 continues the theme of reptilians occupyinghuman form; Enemy Mine and Dreamscape, both starring Dennis Quaid, feature reptilehumanoids; Theodore Rex is about a seven foot tall upright-walking dinosaur; Babylon5, the television series, includes the reptile humanoids called the Narns and the sametheme can be seen in Star Trek; Star Trek, The Next Generation; Space Precinct; Seaquest DSV; Outer Limits, and elsewhere. Steven Speilberg’s Jurassic Park and LostWorld bring dinosaurs back to life and his video animation for children, We’re Back,features two-legged speaking dinosaurs. In one scene a T-Rex is taken into a spaceship,endowed with intelligence and taken forward in time to the present day. Children’smovies and television series are awash with reptilian imagery. Mario Brothers is basedon the idea that the dinosaurs were not wiped out by the meteorite and in fact the impactcreated a parallel dimension where the dinosaurs continued to live and thrive andevolved into intelligent humanoids. The film’s heroes go into an underground passagewhere they fall into that other dimension and battle with humanoid dinosaurs to preventthe invasion of this dimension. Dinotopia and Dinotopia: The World Beneath, thechildren’s books by James Gurney, are stories of an inner-earth world in whichintelligent reptilians and dinosaurs living under the ground with humans. Land Of TheLost features a family who travel back in time to a dinosaur-dominated land where theyare attacked by a race of reptile humanoids called the Sleestak. In one episode, areptilian humanoid studies humans who radiate ‘emotional heat’ - the human emotionalenergy on which the reptilians thrive. The children’s series, Barney, is about a friendlyreptilian and Mutant Ninja Turtles are amphibian-reptilian fighters of crime andinjustice. Dinosaurs in the early 1990s was a children’s television programme about aloveable family of dinosaurs, interestingly called the Sinclair family! One of them iscalled Earl! Cartoons like Dinosaucers; Mutant League; G. L Joe and Dino PowerHouse also include intelligent reptile beings.7 A coincidence? Of course not.For a long time the reptilian-Brotherhood has been preparing to stop humanitymaking the consciousness shift. The pyramid hierarchical nature of their structure hasallowed them to instigate the same plan through countless different institutions andagencies. First they have attacked us at the physical level with drugs, food additives andfluoride in the water. The ancient methods of healing (known today as alternative orcomplementary) are under constant assault from the medical establishment which isawash with Freemasons and under the control of the Brotherhood pharmaceutical cartel.The Rockefeller empire alone now owns more than 60% of the pharmaceutical industryin the United States. These, and the other wings of the global pharmaceutical cartel,"},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"480fund the ‘research’ into new treatments and, of course, these ‘treatments’ always turnout to be drugs. There is an excellent book documenting this called The Medical Mafiaby a Canadian doctor, Guylaine Lanctot, which is available through Bridge of LovePublications. The pharmaceutical cartel interlocks with the major global ‘food’producers like Nestle, Kellogg, Proctor and Gamble and the rest. Through this networkthe Brotherhood can orchestrate a concerted attack on the human body and its mentalprocesses through the drugs, vaccines and food additives. Genetically-engineeredanimals and food is part of this, also. When one of the British scientists involved in thedevelopment of genetically-engineered food publicly questioned its safety, he wasimmediately sacked. So much for living in a country with freedom of expression.Fluoride in the water is a mind suppressant and so are sweeteners like aspartame whichyou find today in almost all the soft drinks. These additives are designed to make itmore difficult for the brain and the cells to tune into the new frequencies. Workers inthe food factories have no idea what they are doing as they just follow orders. Thedecisions are being taken at a much higher level. It is the same with vaccinations, oneof the biggest medical scams of them all. The doctors (most of them) and the nurseshave no idea of the damage they are doing to a child’s body, mind and immune system,when they administer vaccinations. But those who orchestrate the vaccinationprogrammes certainly do. The Brotherhood have also created a highly complex networkof technology to capture the human collective consciousness and delink it from the restof its multidimensional self. This starts out in space with the ‘Star Wars’ technologywhich is part of a vast electromagnetic web on and around the Earth. It includes:Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) transmitters which are broadcasting their signals allover the world; microwave transmissions which include direct attacks on those theBrotherhood wish to kill or discredit through mind manipulation; the mobile phonenetworks which do enormous mental and physical damage and allow the owner to betracked even when the phone is switched off; emissions from televisions, microwaveovens and other technology; and, of course, the microchip. The main reason for thecampaign for a microchipped population is to suppress the awakening and disconnectus from the pulses that are setting us free. A CIA scientist told me that microchippingthe population will give the Brotherhood control of a person’s thoughts, emotions andphysical health.A contact in the financial world, who accepts the reptilian connection from his ownexperience, gave me some interesting background to the modern energy systems. Hehad worked with a number of free energy inventors and he realised that free energytechnology worked in a ‘clockwise’ direction and so was in harmony with the spin ofthe chakras. But most conventional electrical technology was ‘anticlockwise’,therefore in conflict with the chakras. He believed that this was helping to close downthe chakra system and delink humanity from other levels of consciousness. This is onereason why the reptilian-Brotherhood have suppressed, often through murder, thedevelopment of free energy technology.

Brian Desborough told me how people develop back ailments and otherproblems if their bed is pushed against a wall which carries internal wiring. Theircomplaints often clear up if they move the bed a few feet from the wall. We live in apulsating ocean of electromagnetism generated by ‘modern’ technology and this isconstantly affecting human physical, emotional and mental health. The human mind,body and emotions are under an incredible assault in the countdown to the Great Shiftbecause the Brotherhood are desperate to ensure that humanity as a whole does notmake the consciousness leap that will take us beyond the reptilian frequencies.The Brotherhood have also structured the ‘education’ system and the media to lockpeople in what I call the left brain prison. The left brain is the area which deals with thephysical world view, ‘rational’ thought and all that can be seen, touched, heard andsmelled (see Figure 62). The right brain is our intuition and our connection with higherdimensions. This is where you find the artist and creativity, inspired by our uniquenessof thought and expression (see Figure 63). The education system and its offshoots, likethe media and science, are designed to speak to the left brain and to switch off rightbrain thinking. This is why spending on the arts in schools is being cut back all over theworld and rigid, left brain programmes imposed. ‘Education’ fills the left brain withinformation, much of which is untrue and inaccurate, and it demands that this is storedand then regurgitated on the exam paper. If you do this like a robot you pass.

Isn’t education justwonderful?With fear as the reptilians’ greatest weapon, the plan is to engineer events, real andstaged, that will create enormous fear in the countdown years to 2012. This includes aplan to start a third world war either by stimulating the Muslim world into a ‘holy war’against the West or by using the Chinese to cause global conflict. Maybe both. Thebombs placed near US embassies in Africa in 1998 and the American response ofbombing Islamic targets is all part of this. One of their key plans is called ProjectBluebeam. One element of this is to use laser-generating satellites in the ‘Star Wars’network in different parts of the world to project holographic images in the sky ofUFOs, Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha, Khrishna, etc. With each belief system convincedthat their saviour has come, the potential for enormous religious conflict is obvious.Messages will be broadcast (as they already are) on the Extremely Low Frequency(ELF), Very Low Frequency (VLF), Low Frequency (LF) and microwave bands whichcan be picked up by the human brain. This technology is highly sophisticated today andmany people will believe that ‘God’ and their ‘saviour’ is talking to them when it isreally the Brotherhood manipulators. Much ‘channelled’ information comes from thissource already. Project Bluebeam also involves the manifestation of ‘supernatural’phenomena of many kinds to terrify the population and amid the terror and conflict,also via holographic image in the sky, the Brotherhood ‘saviour’ will come. It must beemphasised also, as we consider Project Bluebeam, that the crop circle phenomena doesnot have to be extraterrestrial or ‘supernatural’, as most investigators believe. It couldbe, but it doesn’t have to be. In the period before the complex crop patterns firstappeared in the 1980s the technology was developed which could create them. This wasa high frequency gamma-ray beam device which was developed for the military. Someof the main characteristics of the genuine crop circles (many have been hoaxed) are: thestalks bend at the lowest node and do not break; the cell structure changes; the croppattern emits microwave energy; dead animals inside are carbonised; a high frequencysound or clicking noise is heard when the pattern is first formed; plasma lights aresometimes seen. Every one of these effects would be caused by the gamma-ray beamdevice. The scientist and researcher Brian Desborough says:“The high frequency gamma-ray beam would cause the moisture in the nodes to boil,swelling and softening the nodal cells and causing the straw to bend in the direction sweptby the beam. Such beams are capable of creating extremely fine detail; the high frequencysound which is emitted from newly-formed crop circles strongly suggests that the beamsystems employed in this duplicitous act incorporate Mossbaur technology. The soil withinthe circle would emit radiation and any creature unfortunate enough to be irradiated by thebeam would be carbon ised... Prior to commencing a crop circle, the gamma-ray beamwould require adjustment for focus and power setting. This could account for the one ormore small circular depressions usually to be found adjacent to the crop circle.”"},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"483Some people will ask why, if they are made by the authorities, such an effort wouldhave been made to discredit them with hoaxers to the point where the media now ignorethem. It’s a very good question, but the fact remains that human technology can makethem and we should know that. Incidentally, Desborough suggests that flight TWA 800,the jumbo jet which exploded shortly after take-off from New York, was struck by aMossbaur beam weapon. The autopsy on the victims revealed that their blood hadgelled in their veins and their brains had ‘turned to mush’. This is what the weaponwould produce, and at the time the aircraft was flying near the Brookhaven NavalResearch Station where this very weapon was developed.The UFO scamThe main ambition for Project Bluebeam is to convince the people that the Earth isbeing invaded by extraterrestrials. It is vital we do not buy this crap. Theextraterrestrials are not invading, they’ve been here for thousands of years and theylook, on the surface, like you and me. In 1938 the actor Orson Welles claimed to bebroadcasting live from the site of an ‘alien’ landing in New Jersey. He wasn’t, he wasusing actors and special effects to broadcast from a radio studio. The programme, abroadcast of the ‘novel’ War Of The Worlds by H. G. Wells, caused terror and panic inthe place the invading Martians were said to be. One guy committed suicide and therewere traffic jams of people trying to get away because they thought the Martians hadcome. Welles said it was just a play and people had misunderstood. This was in fact anexperiment to see how people would react to such a situation and they used a storywritten by H. G. Wells, a Brotherhood clone who advocated the reptilian Agenda,including mass mind control. Think about it. If you wanted an excuse to globallycentralise all government, finance, military, police and other institutions, you wouldneed a threat to the planet as a whole. What better way than to kid the people they arebeing invaded from space? You would have a global problem, a global demand that“Something must be done” and an opportunity to offer a global solution: a worldgovernment and army to meet this ‘threat’. That is the plan we are now being preparedfor.Back in the 1960s during the Kennedy administration, it is claimed that a groupof 15 experts in their various fields were brought together to produce a report intoways of controlling the population and centralising power without the use of wars.It became known as the Report from Iron Mountain, an underground facility inNew York State, where they held their first and last meetings. One of the membersleaked the contents to a friend who leaked it more widely, it is said. I detail thereport in .. And The Truth Shall Set You Free. It is claimed to be a hoax, but if itwas, it was an inspired one. Two of the recommendations it made to centralisepower were: a threat to the global environment and a threat from an extraterrestrialinvasion. The report was completed in 1966, the story goes, and in 1968 came theClub of Rome, the Brotherhood-front I talked about earlier, which created theenvironmental movement. The environmental recommendation in the Report from"},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"484Iron Mountain clearly happened. Now they are playing the extraterrestrial card. Fordecades the idea of extraterrestrials was dismissed and laughed at by the media, butsuddenly, now the time is right, they are taking it more and more seriously. UFO‘research’ in the United States has been funded by Laurance Rockefeller and this hasincluded a panel of nine scientists led by the Stanford physicist Peter Sturrock. He toldAmerican television that they had found ‘compelling physical evidence’ that somethingis going on that they do not understand. Now, I wonder what that can be? And look atthe stream of fear-based extraterrestrial television programmes and movies likeIndependence Day (made by 20th Century Fox owned by Rupert Murdoch), AlienResurrection (made by 20th Century Fox owned by Rupert Murdoch) and X-Files(made by Fox Television owned by Rupert Murdoch). And, I should add, RupertMurdoch is owned by the Brotherhood.Underpinning these messages are the countless reports of UFOs being seen and theexperiences of large numbers of people who claim to have been abducted byextraterrestrials. I am not saying this does not happen at all, but some things we can say.The ‘abductees’ invariably recall one, some or all of the following: missing time, clickingor buzzing sounds, sexual feelings and a sulphurous odour. Brian Desborough points outthat these are all typical of contact with intense electromagnetic fields and are caused byneurochemical changes in the brain as he explains in detail. As long ago as 1930,Professor Cazamalli discovered that hallucinations could be induced by electromagneticfrequencies of 500 Megahertz. These phenomena can even be stimulated by areas ofgeopathic stress in the Earth and by overhead power lines, both of which produceelectromagnetic fields and they can certainly be produced by the electromagnetictechnology used by the Brotherhood in their mind control projects. The effect andpotential of electromagnetic fields to take people into altered states of consciousness andto trigger many ‘supernatural’ phenomena is enormous. Unless we understand this,extraterrestrial explanations can be given for very terrestrial events. This applies toplasma balls and lights in the sky which are commonly caused by electromagneticprojections from the Earth. The modern explosion of UFO sightings did not begin untilafter the Second World War, by which time the Germans for one had developed forms of‘flying saucers’. Project Paperdip was the British Intelligence-American Intelligenceoperation to spring the top Nazi scientists, engineers, geneticists and mind manipulatorsfrom Germany and take them to North or South America. This would have transferred this‘UFO’ knowledge across the Atlantic and it was soon after this that the flying saucerswere reported in increasing numbers in the United States. The famous Roswell incidenthappened in 1947. Cattle mutilations have been blamed on extraterrestrials because, it issaid, there is no human technology that could dissect the cattle and drain their blood inthis way. But Brian Desborough points out that this is not true. A portable laser of the typenecessary was developed by the US Airforce Phillips Laboratory for use by special forcespersonnel and it was after this that the cattle mutilations began. Some of the first oneshappened near the chemical warfare laboratory at Dulce in New Mexico and Desboroughsuggests that the cattle are being abducted as part of this research."},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"485This would explain why many of them are daubed with luminous paint which can onlybe seen at night. These cattle can be winched aboard a craft, their body parts removed,and returned to a different area of the field, so leaving no footprints and creating a great‘mystery’. Many uninformed (or otherwise) UFO researchers say that craft like the one atRoswell must be extraterrestrial because they are made of a material with a non-crystalline structure which cannot be produced on Earth or cut with human tools. Not trueagain. Desborough says that the process of producing such metals is called splat cooling.“Molten metal is deposited on a cryogenically-cooled surface (which) results in a non-crystalline product. Similarly, when metal is compressed at temperatures approachingabsolute zero, the metal attains a room temperature hardness of a diamond.”8The UFO ‘research’ community is alive with Brotherhood disinformants andintelligence gatherers. A number of the main ‘whistle-blowers’ and UFO authors aremembers of an intelligence unit known as the Aviary because their code names are allbirds. It makes you wonder how ‘former’ intelligence operatives are allowed to talkfreely about secret projects when to do so should mean severe action against them andthe loss of all pension rights for violation of their oath of secrecy. Then there’s thetechnology known as EDOM (Electronic Dissolution of Memory) which is used onformer intelligence operatives to extinguish knowledge the authorities do not wantrevealed. Other Aviary members or operatives include many of the hypnotists who ‘help’the ‘abductees’ to recall their ‘memories’ of ‘alien’ abduction. Some of the ‘star’contactees have connections to secret projects. George Adamski was involved withscientists at the Point Loma Naval Electronics Laboratory and a similar operation inPasadena, when he announced his extraterrestrial contacts to the world. The microchipswhich are claimed to have been implanted in abductees by extraterrestrials are, in fact,very much of the Earth. They were developed by a consortium of engineers fromMotorola, General Electric, IBM and the Boston Medical Center. One example is theIBM 2020 chip used in the Project Monarch mind control programme. These are alsoimplanted in their unsuspecting patients by doctors and dentists under contract to theintelligence agencies. More and more books are now being published about evil alienswho are invading the planet and so where is all this leading? I’ll let Henry Kissingeranswer that one in a passage from a speech at the 1992 Bilderberg meeting at Evian-Les-Bains, in France. It was written down, it seems, by a Swiss delegate. Kissinger said:“Today, America would be outraged if UN troops entered Los Angeles to restore order;tomorrow they will be grateful. This is especially true if they were told that there were anoutside threat from beyond, whether real or promulgated, that threatened our veryexistence. It is then that all peoples of the world will plead with world leaders to deliverthem from this evil.“The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenario,individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well being granted tothem by their world government.”"},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"486That’s the reason for the UFO scam. Problem-reaction-solution. The extra-terrestrials are not invading they are already here and they are the ones, operatingthrough physical bodies, who will offer to ‘save’ us! The UFO investigator and lecturerNono Hayakawa says this plan is called ‘Project Panic’ and that high technologyequipment will be used to create an optical illusion of a UFO invasion. This will givegovernments and the United Nations the excuse to call a global state of emergency andall those emergency powers and executive orders will be implemented. The Y2Kcomputer ‘virus’, which is predicted to bring chaos across the Millennium, is anothermanipulated ‘problem’ with this in mind. As I detailed earlier, the executive orderspassed this century by Presidents of the United States without Congressional debate orapproval will allow the Government to take over transport, energy, your home and allmedia. These executive orders allow the Government to tell you where you will liveand to put you to work in any way they want. Your children can be taken away fromyou, anything goes when those orders are enforced by a manufactured ‘emergency’.You will find that similar powers are available to all governments in thesecircumstances. Other aspects of the Brotherhood Agenda, across the ‘Millennium’ andthe years to 2012, include: a global financial collapse to introduce the one-worldelectronic currency; conflicts and terrorism galore; and a whole range of other events toterrify and dispirit the human population into unquestioning servitude.But it doesn’t have to be like this. You are not an ‘ordinary’, ‘powerless’ humanbeing. You are an aspect of eternal consciousness, a genius waiting to happen. All youneed to do is open your heart, open your mind, reconnect with that genius and graspyour infinite power to create your own destiny. That is our challenge in this incredibletime of opportunity and we are going to see freedom return to this planet for the firsttime in so, so long.SOURSOURSOURSOURSOURCESCESCESCESCES1Gregg Braden, Awakening To Zero Point (Laura Lee Productions, 1996).2From The Ashes Of Angels, p 18.3David Icke, The Truth Vibrations (Gateway Books, Wel low, Bath, England, first published byAquarian Books in 1991).4http://solar.uleth.ca/solar/5“Solar Cycle Status Report”,taken from the Solar Website, July 4th 1997.6Ibid.7John Rhodes, the Reptoid website.8Brian Desborough, “An Overview of UFO Contact and Abduction Phenomena”, informationpaper for author, 1998."},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"487CHAPTER TWENTY-ONEBreaking the spellWhat I am about to outline is the information the Brotherhood most want to suppress. Itis the knowledge that you are in control of your destiny and no-one else is. You alwayshave been and always will be.Reading this book you may find that strange. After all, have I not detailed how theBrotherhood have controlled the world for thousands of years? Yes, but how have theydone that? By manipulating the way humanity thinks and feels. How we think and feelcreates our physical experience and if we allow an outside force to manipulate our mindand emotions, we will allow them to control our physical experience, our destiny. But wecan change that in an instant if we take back control of our thinking and emotions. Creatingour own reality and deciding our own destiny is, at its heart, a very simple process. It canbe summed up by “What we give out is what we get back”. It works like this...Our mind and emotions resonate wavelengths of various frequencies depending onhow we are thinking and feeling. This applies not only to our conscious self, but alsoour subconscious, that cauldron of suppressed thoughts, attitudes and emotions that wewould rather not deal with. You can resonate the vibration of anger from that levelwithout actually feeling the emotion consciously at the time. For instance, an adultwho is holding on to suppressed anger about their childhood, will still be broadcastingthat frequency, even though they might not be consciously aware of being angry. Thiswill draw to them, by the law of vibrational attraction, other people who areconsciously and subconsciously angry. I know, I’ve been there. In the words of a songI heard in the United States: “When you hold anger, guess what comes to you? A lot ofvery angry people do.” Our mental and emotional ‘vibes’ of all kinds are broadcast asa series of wave patterns and these draw towards us similar wave patterns in the formof people, places, ways of life and experiences. What we give out, we attract to us.Within this cocktail of vibrations are our conscious thoughts and feelings and theastrological patterns we take on at birth and/or, some say, conception. When we areborn we absorb the energy pattern in the Earth’s field at the time and in the place weenter this world. This pattern depends on where the planets are in their cycles and,therefore, which of their energies are most effecting the Earth. Every second theenergy field is changing and so when and where we are born matters enormously tothe energy field we inherit. We choose where and when we are born to take on theenergy pattern most appropriate for our lifeplan. Look at the endless evidence of how"},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"488people in certain professions tend to be born in the same period of the year. TheBabylonian Brotherhood, particularly through Christianity and ‘science’, has sought tocondemn astrology as either evil or ridiculous to encourage people to dismiss it. Onceagain, Christians have done excellent work for the Brotherhood in this regard, most ofthem without any idea of the Agenda they were advancing.This cocktail of interacting vibrations draws towards us a reflection of itself. Whenwe think we are a victim and we are not in control of our lives, we will synchronisewith the energies (people, experiences) which resonate to that frequency. We willtherefore create a victimised, powerless physical experience. When we believe that thebest things in life happen to others, they do, because we are not connecting with theenergies that will manifest the best things in life. When you believe you will never haveenough money, you won’t. Money is an energy and if you are going to attract thatenergy, you need to make a vibrational connection with it. Thinking that you will neverattract money, consciously or subconsciously, ensures that you will be out of sync withthat energy and you stay poor. The Brotherhood know this and they have created anenergy flow which attracts money to them. Fear of something is always guaranteed toattract what you fear. The energy of fear attracts like energy and so what you fearbecomes what you physically experience. Fear of being without money becomes thecircumstances in which you are without money. Fear of being alone, rejected orattacked all become that physical experience unless you deal with the source of theenergy which manifests these things - YOU. So its no good blaming anyone else foryour life. You have either created it by your own thoughts and feelings or theBrotherhood has done so because you have allowed your thoughts and feelings to bemanipulated by religion, the media, politics, doctors, teachers and all the rest.Whichever it is, the one responsible for your life is... YOU. No getting away from it,I’m afraid, you are stuck with it. But then, this news is just wonderful. It means that ifyou created the present reality that you don’t like, you can just as easily create a newreality that you do like. You are in control. You have all the answers. You are the centreof your own universe and you can make it whatever you choose. You are simplyincredible. Feel it, live it and your world will be transformed.My book, I Am Me, I Am Free, is all about this need to restore our mental andemotional powers because unless we do so we can never be free. But we need to do morethan that. We need to set ourselves free, yes, but just as importantly we need to set eachother free. We have been manipulated by the Brotherhood into our personal prisons andthe prisoners have been further manipulated into policing each other. Humanity is boththe sheep and the sheep dog. The Brotherhood set the religious, political, medical andscientific ‘norms’ by controlling those professions and, therefore, the norms promoted bythe mesmerised media. Most people then live their lives within these norms and allowthem to programme their sense of possibility, potential and who or what they are. This isthe eggshell and if people want to concede their uniqueness and infinite power in thisway, fine, go ahead. Couldn’t care less. But what happens is that those who live in theseprisons are not satisfied with that. They insist that everyone else does the same. It’s not"},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":"489enough for them to believe in a religion, they also seek to impose that belief oneveryone else or condemn them if they do not accept that religion’s view of life. Therewould be no religious wars if we respected each others’ right to believe whatever wechoose, so long as we don’t impose it on anyone else. I don’t have a problem withpeople taking part in Satanic ritual if everyone involved is making that choice while incomplete control of their own thinking processes. People want to sacrifice each otherand all involved have made a free choice? Go ahead, but please, someone clear up themess. Eventually they will learn from the experience and evolve to a higher level ofunderstanding. If George Bush, Henry Kissinger, the Windsors and the rest of the gangwant to start a self-contained community and run it as a fascist state with everyonewillingly taking part, please feel free. They’ll have no challenge from me. I’minterested when these things are imposed on people through secrecy and manipulationor by physical, mental or pharmaceutical force. Surely we can summon the maturity tothink for ourselves and allow others to do the same? Is that really too much to ask? If itis, we are in serious trouble.The only way the few can control the world is if the masses help them to do it: and wedo. I have spoken to audiences about freedom and had wild applause, but do weunderstand what the word means? “Yes, freedom, that’s what we want!” Oh really? Thenwhy do many of these same people who wildly applaud the concept of freedom, insist thatthose who are not Christians are lesser human beings or the Devil incarnate? Why do theyinsist (the Muslims, Hindus and ‘Jews’, as well) that their children are brought up frombirth to believe what they believe, at the expense of other views and information? Thetimes I have been asked at meetings in America if I am a Christian, as if I become morecredible and believable if I am. The very need to ask that question is confirmation that thequestioner is in mental servitude to a belief system of Brotherhood creation. And that’s thepoint. We are imprisoned by what we are manipulated to believe. The power of belief toentrap a mind is incredible. The Brotherhood do not care what you believe as long as youbelieve something to the exclusion of other possibilities. I am quite happy to change myviews on any or all the information in this book if that is where new information leads me.I am not attached to it because I am only seeking the truth, whatever it is. If it is somethingdifferent to what I think now, fine. So be it. Rigid beliefs defend themselves from allcomers because the belief becomes the person’s sense of self, their sense of security, and sothey would rather cling on to the belief than face the mental and emotional challenge ofletting it go. But we are now facing a time of the most phenomenal change in which allbeliefs are going to crumble. You can write the future on a blank piece of paper far easierthan one that is full of old data. You can plant new flowers on an empty piece of garden fareasier than one still consumed by weeds. It is time to clear our minds of belief and be opento all possibility. Only then can we be free to tap into infinity.What I have detailed in this book is one level of the picture, the one which mostdirectly affects people in human bodies today. But there are other levels to consideralso. It is important to realise that two conflicting statements can both be equally truedepending on the level from which you observe the same situation. An example is to"},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"490say on one hand that this world is imperfect and on the other that everything thathappens on the Earth is perfection. How can both be true? Well they are. From theperspective of everyday life, the world is not perfect. We have wars, hunger, disease,unhappiness and pain of all kinds. That’s true. But from the perspective of the evolutionof humanity everything is perfect. That’s equally true. The only way we can evolve is bylearning from experience and that means experiencing the consequences of our thoughtsand actions. If there were no unpleasant consequences for our actions, how could wepossibly learn and evolve to higher levels of understanding? It would be like a childdaubing paint all over the walls of your house or throwing stones through your windows.If the child did not face the consequences and see that such behaviour is deeply upsettingfor the home owner, what would happen? The child would go on daubing paint overother houses and smashing more windows. Humanity has given its mind away all thesethousands of years and if we are to regain that power to consciously control our owndestiny, we have to be kicked in the backside by facing the consequences until, at last,the penny drops and the light goes on. So we have the wars and conflicts andmanipulations of all kinds. I don’t hate these reptilians. I want to love them because thatis what they need so desperately Their behaviour can only come from a lack of self-lovebecause only by loving yourself for what you are, can you begin to truly love others forwhat they are. So I love you Queen of England, Queen Mother, Prince Charles, PrincePhilip, Pindar, Henry Kissinger, George Bush, Edward Heath and all the rest. If thesepeople would only love themselves this nightmare (and their nightmare) would be over.Until they do, their heart connection to their infinite soul (pure love) will remain closedand they will continue to manifest these same attitudes and this behaviour. I would alsostress again, before I finish, that when I talk of reptilians I am talking only of those whoare seeking to manipulate humanity, not the species as a whole. Many of the reptilianspecies are trying to help us break the spell and even the manipulating reptilians arepossessed by a fifth dimensional force. In the end we’re all One, anyway.I know that many people who are aware of the Brotherhood and its Agenda feel theonly way to respond is by stockpiling weapons and preparing for an armed defence oftheir liberties. I can’t think of a response more certain to bring about the very fasciststate they say they want to avoid. The idea of meeting violence with violence is soobviously contradictory and so utterly devoid of the faintest spark of intelligence, thatone wonders how few brain cells must be activated to conjure such a thought. Whenyou meet violence with violence what do you get every time? Twice the violence. Yes,that’s going to make an enormous contribution to peace. Also, when anyone usesviolence against the system, it gives the Brotherhood a public excuse to use its high-tech weaponry to blow away the opposition in the name of the rule of ‘law’. I think weneed to be just a touch more subtle than stockpiling weapons, somehow. I have metsome of the more extreme Christian patriots in the United States and as I said to one: “Idon’t know which I dislike more, the world controlled by the Brotherhood, or the oneyou want to replace it with”. This particular guy talked about freedom and the need todefend it with armed resistance while claiming that black people were genetically"},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"491inferior to whites and that the Native Americans were only “looking after” the lands ofAmerica “until we (the whites) arrived”. He would have got on so well with his hero, theFounding Father Thomas Jefferson. But here we see the theme again. People like thischap will, I’m sure, end up in armed conflict with the Brotherhood forces at some point.Indeed it is inevitable unless he changes his attitudes, because what will happen is thatthe two same states of being under different names (the Brotherhood and the extremeChristian Patriots) will attract each other into their lives to play out their drama of mutualviolence. They both believe in the use of violence and so they are both in the samefrequency range. They may call themselves by different names, but they are notopposites, they are oppo-sames. The confrontation has to happen for them to evolve andlearn that violence solves nothing. Never has, never will. When you hear the ChristianPatriots describe their alternative to the Brotherhood Agenda they say they want to have“One nation under God”. OK, but who’s version of God? The Christian God? TheMuslim God? The Hindu God? The God as visualised by Ethel in New York or Bill inLos Angeles? No, they mean, of course, the Christian God, the vision of God that theybelieve in. They don’t actually want to replace the Brotherhood Agenda with freedom,but with their own version of dictatorship. Again, because both want to impose their willon others and suppress other lifestyles and beliefs, they are bound to attract each otherbecause they are operating within the same frequency range. What is true of the extremeChristians is equally true of the extreme Muslims, Hindus, Jews and other religions. Toan extent the same was true of the Native Americans when the white Europeans came.The Native American culture contains some tremendous wisdom and has a far greaterunderstanding of the connection of all things. But let’s not go overboard here as so manyin the New Age Movement often do with their starry-eyed vision of Native America.Before the whites came scores of Native American tribes used to war with each othersimply because they were in different tribes. There was much slaughter and conflict.Such a macho, war-paint mentality will attract into its life another energy that equallythinks that violence is justified. Whenever you have two groups who think violence is anoption they are a vibrational confrontation waiting to happen.Fortunately many Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Jews and Native Americans arenot extreme and there is an alternative to violence. We can either learn from thehardest and most painful of experience or we can use our intelligence and our love toobserve this situation and change our state of being without a gun being fired. Thenthese confrontations will be avoided because there will no vibrational attractionbetween the Brotherhood and those who wish to scupper their Agenda. We can do itwithout confrontation. The reptilian vibrational connection to humanity is throughthe emotion of fear. They are themselves consumed by fear which is why theybehave as they do. If they can manipulate humanity into a state of fear, as they have,they make the vibrational connection which allows them to control the humanpsyche. They are also playing at home, you might say, because they are experts onthe emotion of fear. This reptilian group are the very expression of it. If we seek tostop the reptilian-Brotherhood with a confrontation on their home ground of fear by"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"492using hatred, aggression and violence, then forget it.The game is already over. But if we meet this challengefrom a frequency range the Brotherhood cannot evenconceive of - love - we will transform the world and thereptilian control will be no more. There are manyreasons for this. Firstly, when we open our hearts tolove, the heart chakra spins with tremendous speed andpower, whipping up the frequency of our incarnate consciousness to the highestvibrational expression of life, pure love. As our soul is pure love, we reconnect with theawesome power of our multidimensional self (see Figure 64). The eggshell explodes.The fast, short, wavelength of love also activates the ‘antenna’ in our DNA whichreconnects us with the cosmos and an open heart chakra tunes into the cosmic pulsefrom the Earth, the Sun and the centre of the Galaxy, and transmits that changingdrumbeat to our brain and every cell in our bodies. This will dramatically transform ourminds, emotions and physical form as they synchronise with the quickening vibrationsat this time of unbelievable change and evolution. The subsequent leap in our personalfrequencies will lift us out of the vibrational pit of fear and onto levels far beyond thelower fourth dimension. The reptilian control will be over because they will be on adifferent radio station, if you like, and they will have to face the consequences of theirown actions on their road to enlightenment. The choice is ours, fear or love, prison orfreedom.If the reptilians did not exist we would have to invent them because their currentstate of being represents something that human consciousness had to experience. Ifthat was not so, the reptilians would be manipulating someone else. We would nothave attracted them. They have given us a gift in our eternal evolution, a gift ofexperiencing the consequences of fear and of conceding our infinite power to anotherforce, be it a parent, boss, peer pressure, or, ultimately, the reptilian-Brotherhood. Theevolutionary process is about love, not punishment. It does not punish us for ouractions, it gives us the consequences of them, which is very different. Without that wecannot evolve. We are loved along this journey by consciousness levels (other aspectsof self) which seek to help us to become more loving and more enlightened, to bemasters of ourselves. Our choice is how much of this experience we need before welearn and move on. Are we going to change now or do we require more wars, hunger,and suffering, before the light bulb flashes? Are we going to walk through the fast-approaching gateway to a whole new state of being? Or are we going to stay where weare and face another cycle of incarnation and reincarnation until another opportunitycomes? The reptilian group I have highlighted are deeply imbalanced because they areFiguw 64: When people are conditioned to close down theirconsciousness they delink from their eternal soul and all the love,wisdom, knowledge and inspiration waiting to be tapped. It is not thatwe need to seek enlightenment - we are enlightened. We just need toremove the barriers of fear which disconnect us from our ownenlightenment outside the ‘egg shell’."},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"493disconnected from those levels of self which resonate to the rhythm of love. But theyare still part of everything that exists, they are still you and me, an aspect of the gloriouswhole we call Cod. So if we hate them, we hate ourselves. If we are violent to them, weare violent to ourselves. And it would be all so self defeating. I say: forgive them forthey know not what they do. By forgive and by love, I don’t mean to walk away and letthem get on with it. They are seeking to impose their will and therefore there is alegitimate cause for a challenge to that. But if this Brotherhood control is caused bygiving our minds, power and responsibility away, and by insisting that others do thesame, it is ourselves we need to address, not only the behaviour of the reptilians. If wetake back our power and set ourselves and each other free from imposition of thought,belief and lifestyle, it doesn’t matter what the Brotherhood do. Control from the centrewill be impossible because you cannot centralise control of diversity, only uniformity.Three things will transform life on Barth and remove the reptilian control of the humanpsyche:1We let go of our fear of what other people think of us and we express our uniquenessof view and lifestyle, even (no, especially) if it differs from the ‘norm’. At this pointwe cease to be a sheep following the flock.2We allow everyone else to do the same without fear of being ridiculed or condemnedfor the crime of being different. When we do this we cease to be the sheep dog forthe rest of the flock, pressuring them to conform to what we believe is right.3No-one seeks to impose what they believe on anyone else, so always respecting freewill and free choice.There is no way the Brotherhood Agenda can survive such changes in attitude. Peopleask me what they should do in response to my information, but I never answer thatquestion. The only person who knows what is best for you, is you. The trick is to clear thechannel to your higher dimensions so you can connect with the highest level of yourwisdom, love and inspiration to guide you to do what is most appropriate for you. Wedon’t need to sit around in smoke filled rooms or start new political parties. We need toremove the egg shell of low vibrational emotion - fear -and the law of vibrationalattraction will connect us with all the people and organisations we need to transform theplanet. When we get ourselves right, the world must come right because we are the worldand the world is us. What we call society is the sum total of human thinking and feeling.It is a reflection of our attitudes. When we change them, we change society We are only achange of mind away from real freedom, the freedom to express our Cod-givenuniqueness and celebrate the diversity of gifts, perceptions and inspiration that existwithin the collective human psyche. The creative force is within us all and desperate toexpress itself. It is the suppression of this energy which leads to so much pent-upfrustration and therefore violence and depression. Imagine you are a gifted artist or"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"494dancer, but peer pressure, parent pressure and the demands of the system insist that youwork in a bank or sit next to a factory machine all day. Or you want to express yourcreativity and make a contribution to the world, but the Brotherhood manipulation of thefinancial system means that you can’t find a job. That all-powerful creative force withinyou cannot be suppressed, so it comes out in an imbalanced way, impregnated with thevibration of anger, despair or frustration, and so we have violence and the demand fordrugs and alcohol to shut off the emotional pain. If we respected the value of all creativityand sought ways of allowing it to be expressed, these things would not happen on the scalethat they do. Instead we demand that such creativity must ‘pay for itself’ or contribute tothe economy - the Brotherhood’s economy. We know the price of everything and the valueof nothing. If, however, we could open our hearts to a greater vision of possibility, wewould unleash the creative force in everyone and allow it to express its uniqueness. What aworld of incredible diversity and inspiration we would then experience. A world guided bythe flow of the creative force and not by the profit demands of the Brotherhood bankers.I talked at the start of the book about thinking the unthinkable. The information herehas challenged you to do that. To consider the evidence that reptilians on anotherdimension of existence have manipulated humanity for thousands of years. To considerthat far from being ordinary and powerless, you are extraordinary and all powerful.Both are unthinkable for most people given the current level of conditioning. But theyare not unfeelable. There is such a difference. You think with your intellect and that isso vulnerable to programming through the eyes and ears by the daily diet of lies,suppression and misrepresentation in the media and by all those Brotherhood clones towhich it offers a platform. But when we feel, we are tapping into our heart centre, ourintuition, that connection with the cosmos. How often has what you think and what youinstinctively feel been in conflict? What transformed my life more than anything wasthe moment I decided to follow my intuition whenever it was at odds with my intellect.Every time I have done this, my intuition has turned out to be correct. It can bechallenging and painful sometimes because your intuition, which is unbounded by theneed to follow ‘norms’, often stands out against convention. But it will always lead youto do what is best for you and your eternal journey of evolution through experience. Formost people when they instinctively feel to do something, the chatterbox mind begins tolist all the reasons why they should not do it. “You can’t do that, what will theneighbours say, or your family, the people at work, and the guys down the bar?”... “Youcan’t do that, you’ve got a mortgage, a car, a family, and the life insurance policies topay for.”... “You can’t, you can’t, you can’t.” But you can, you can, you CAN. There isnothing wrong with the intellect. It keeps you grounded, stores and processes this-worldinformation, and it has an important part to play It is when it becomes our controllingforce and sole decision-maker that we find ourselves in the prison of the mind. Theintellect is there to make physical the guidance and inspiration of the intuition, not todictate the odds. Don’t work for your mind, make your mind work for you.So it’s not what you think about the information in this book that matters, it is whatyou feel about it. Some of the content will challenge your intellect to breaking point, but"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"495your intuition will have no such problem. To that level of you, it either feels right, or itdoesn’t. If it doesn’t, walk away I am not trying to ‘convert’ anyone to a belief. I couldnot care less what you think or feel about me and my work. But I care passionatelyabout your right to hear what is currently being denied to you. How you react to it isnone of my business, let alone my concern. You are, however, going to see unfoldingbefore your eyes in your every day experience, the Agenda I have described. You willnever watch a news bulletin, read a paper, or hear a political or economicannouncement, in the same way again. You will also see the weather changes advancingand staggering geological events as the transformation of the Earth’s energy fieldscontinues apace. You will feel the gathering vibrations in your heart and your mind.Your rapidly changing perception of life and yourself will open you to unimaginablepossibility and potential. Thinking the unthinkable will become a way of life for thosewho grasp this opportunity to reconnect with all that exists. There are many who willconsider this book negative, but they have misunderstood what is happening here. Thisinformation is rising to the surface after thousands of years at the same time that moreand more people are waking up to who they really are. The same vibrational changesare responsible for both. There is a healing going on and for the healing to start thecause of the disease has to be addressed. The rising frequency is bringing to the surfaceall that has remained hidden, collectively and individually, to allow the healing tobegin. This is why people who have opened up to the changing cosmic rhythm havefound that all hell breaks loose in their lives at first. Relationships break up, jobs arelost, family and people they considered friends walk away There are many differentexperiences that people have. With me it was massive public ridicule because I never doanything by halves. You can think you have made a monumental mistake at the time,but quite the opposite is happening. We create our own reality and control our owndestiny and the way we do that is overwhelmingly through our intent. So often peoplehave said to me that nothing ever happens in their lives and nothing ever seems towork. But when I ask them what they really want to do they reply: “I don’t know,really” Well if that is their state of being, their physical experience will reflect “I don’tknow really”, and nothing of significance will happen. If, instead, you focus your intenton a specific goal, what you need to do to achieve it will always come towards you asone vibrational pattern attracts reflections of itself in people, experiences andopportunities. This is where the journey ends for most people. When they are faced withwhat they need to do to achieve their goal, they suddenly think that perhaps it wasn’tsuch a good idea after all! And that’s the question. You say you want something? OK,but how badly? Just a little bit? Fine, then don’t waste your time. With every fibre ofyour being? Well, go for it because the world is yours.I have seen countless people say they want to transform themselves and their livesand tune into the new vibration. But when the challenges have come, which arenecessary to make that happen, they want out immediately and go back to life as before.Yet these challenges set us free. The reason we face personal and emotional mayhemwhen we start this journey is because of the need to clean out our emotional cesspit of"},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"496suppressed and unprocessed emotional debris that we have pushed deep into oursubconscious because we don’t want to deal with it. If we don’t clear the emotionalgunge of this and other physical lifetimes, we can’t reconnect with our multidimensionalself. We can’t be free of the reptilian manipulation and control from the lower fourthdimension. So when we say we intend to transform, that intent draws to us the peopleand experiences necessary to bring that suppressed emotion to the surface where we cansee it and deal with it. The same is happening collectively as the information presented inthis book comes into the light of public attention, so we can see it, address it and heal it.Much of the New Age is in denial of this collective cesspit because it doesn’t want toface its own personal cesspit. It would rather sit around a candle and kid itself it isenlightened while, in fact, it is an emotional wreck with a crystal in its hand. Theinformation in this book is part of the healing of Planet Earth and the humanconsciousness as the veil lifts on all that has remained hidden and denied.Hey, this is a wonderful time we’re living through here. We are tuning to the cosmicdance, the wind of change, the rhythm of reconnection with all that is, has been, or everwill be. You have come to make a difference, for yourself and for the world. You havethe opportunity to do that now, now, now. Crasp it and let’s end this nonsense. A fewcan only control billions because the billions let it happen. We don’t have to. And wecan change it just by being ourselves, allowing other people to be themselves, andenjoying the gift of life. This is not a time to fear and it’s not a time to hide. It is a timeto sing and a time to dance.Take your partners, please.
