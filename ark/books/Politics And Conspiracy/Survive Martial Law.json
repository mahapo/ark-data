Even if you don't believe it now, hopefully you will after reading this piece. I am going to show you a way to survive the implementing of vicious Ma rtial Law coming in 2007/2008 . Millions will starve to death and the Government hasn’t done anything to prevent it. In fact, its fine with them as genocide is also in their plans. These pages are about basic survival and why things are as they have become. I’ll show you what is happening, what is ‘going’ to happ en and show you why it is going to affect us all... then at the e nd I will tell you critical things that you will need to do, without e xception, to stay alive. This is probably the most important informa tion you’ve ever had about staying alive while others die so pa y close attention. Read it... it means your very life! Most of the things I'm going to tell you will immed iately recognize as the pure truth... You’ve heard enough about it t o know it’s real. I'm just removing all the bull and soft sell for yo u. Things are happening all around us but generally we've been to o busy, tired, been good sports fans, chased money or have other p lans to think for ourselves anymore. I'll show you what’s going on and what is going on for real and not the watered down so-calle d news you get from major news media... it’s even available via the hundreds of articles from true newsmen and women, the Internet and a hundred other sources! The big difference is I haven’t bee n put under restrictions and I’ve spent years studying and read ing many hours every day and am simply following a very few honest people of commentary. I am an x-military advisor and also know how to read 100’s of books and websites... some I’ll give yo u at the end of this vital article which will shock you. It will b e enough to prove what I say as if the government hasn’t already. No thing here is my opinion but simply the results of intense study as I have an interest in the function of government and how ours is falli ng apart.

The Martial Laws I’ve been involved in usually are the most deadly during the implementation... the early months. Armed resistance is an issue you must decide on yourself. This informa tion is about basic survival in buying inexpensive foods (rather than the costly and “high profit” long term storage items now selli ng all over the net). I also tell you how to act around young and aggressive combatant troops without pissing them off so they w ill either kill you or send you off to one of the 800 Concentration Camps in the USA right now! I have been a Military advisor who taught occupying troops so I know why some people die whil e others live for a better day. There are just a few behaviors t o practice. It’s also clear that in the first few months of violent Marti al Law there’s a time many people starve to death not only because t he government won’t give them food but because it usually isn’t a vailable. This year is worst as it’s also the worst crop harvest f or 200 years. I will simply try to keep you and your family alive for th e next year. Whatever else you do is YOUR OWN BUSINESS. I won’t comment on it here as it’s a personal decision and a compli cated mess. I will “guide” you to relative safety and if you ca n follow a few simple moves, I will lead you to a way you can surv ive this coming horror.

FEMA is the umbrella under which multiple sub-organizations will function. Here is a description of this massive organization. FEMA - The Secret Government Some people have referred to it as the \"secret gove rnment\" of the United States. It is not an elected body, it does n ot involve itself in public disclosures, and it even has a quasi-secr et budget in the billions of dollars. This government organization h as more power than the President of the United States or the Cong ress, it has the power to suspend laws , move entire populations , arrest and detain citizens without a warrant and hold them without trial , it can seize property , food supplies (which is why you’ll need to hide them) , transportation systems, and can suspend the Constitution. Not only is it the most powerful entity in the Unit ed States, but it was not even created under Constitutional law by th e Congress. It was a product of a series of Presidential Execut ive Orders. No, it is not the U.S. military. The organization is ca lled FEMA, which stands for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Originally conceived in the Richard Nixon Administr ation, it was refined by President Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and given teeth in the Ronald Reagan and George Bush Administrations. FEMA had one original concept when it was created, to assure the survivability of the United States government i n the event of a nuclear attack on this nation. It was also provided with the task of being a federal coordinating body during times of d omestic disasters, such as earthquakes, floods and hurrican es. Its awesome powers grew under the tutelage of people li ke Lt. Col. Oliver North and General Richard Secord, the archit ects on the Iran-Contra scandal and the looting of America's sa vings and loan institutions. FEMA has even been given control of the State Defense Forces, a rag-tag, often considered neo-Naz i, civilian army that will substitute for the National Guard be cause the Guard has been called to duty overseas. Some of th e remaining 1.1 million US armed forces will also be sent overs eas... very soon, but many of them are, although still active, the old, untrained and non-combatants.

Frankly, the average America doesn’t know much of anything.

In the West, it works in conjunction with the Sixth Ar my. The USA is divided into 11 control zones for effective FEMA management... see ‘FEMA, the control zones’ at the e nd of this article. FEMA was created by a series of Executive Orders . A Presidential Executive Order, “whether Constitutional or not ,” becomes “law” simply by its publication in the Federal Registry. “Congress is by- passed”. Apparently, as we’ve recently learned, s o can a simple Presidential Directive. It can be legal or illegal but still becomes solid Law of the land. Executive Order Number 1214 8 created the Federal Emergency Management Agency that is to inte rface with the Department of Defense for civil defense plannin g and funding. An \"emergency czar\" was appointed. FEMA has spent about 6 percent of the national budget on national emergenc ies but the bulk of their funding has been used for their army and construction of secret underground facilities to as sure continuity of government in case of a major emergency, foreign or domestic. Executive Order Number 12656 appointed th e National Security Council as the principal body that should consider emergency powers. This allows the government to inc rease domestic intelligence and surveillance of U.S. citi zens and would restrict the freedom of movement within the United States and grant the government the right to ‘isolate’ large g roups of civilians.

Because FEMA was accused of dropping the ball in Florida, the media and Congress commenced t o study this agency. What came out of the critical look was that FEMA was spending 12 times more for \"black operations\" than for disaster relief. It spent $2.3 billion building secret bunke rs throughout the United States in anticipation of government disrupt ion by domestic upheaval. Yet fewer than 20 members of Con gress, only members with top security clearance, know of the ex penditure by FEMA for non-natural disaster situations. These few Congressional leaders state that FEMA has a \"black curtain\" around its operations. FEMA has worked on National Security programs since 1979, and its predecessor, the Feder al Emergency Preparedness Agency, has secretly spent m illions of dollars before being merged into FEMA by President Carter in 1979. FEMA has developed hundreds of sophisticated mobile units that are capable of sustaining themselves for months. Th e vehicles are located in five areas of the United States.

FEMA's enormous powers can be triggered easily . In any form of domestic or foreign problem, perceived and “not alw ays actual ,” emergency powers can be enacted. The President of t he United States now has broad powers to declare martial law, which activates FEMA's extraordinary and terrifying powers . Martial law can be declared during time of increased tension ov erseas, economic problems within the United States, such as a depression, lawful civil unrest, such as common dem onstrations or scenes like the Los Angeles riots, and in a drug crisis or a dog pissing on a tree.

The plan also advocated the rounding up and transfe r to what they are calling \"assembly centers or relocation ca mps\" of a least millions of African American Negroes in the event o f any rioting or disorder, not unlike the rounding up of the Jews in Nazi Germany in the 1930s. Hispanics are seriously targeted, especially in areas like southern California, south Florida and other areas where there is heavy concentration of a ny groups that drain heavily on social programs which cost b illions. The second known time that FEMA stood by was in 199 0 when Desert Storm was enacted. Prior to President Bush' s invasion of Iraq, FEMA began to draft new legislation to increa se its already formidable powers. One of the elements incorporated into the plan was to set up operations within any state or l ocality without the prior permission of local or state authorities. Such prior permission has always been required in the past. Mu ch of the mechanism being set into place was in anticipation of the economic collapse of the Western World. Even now, 2007 crop failures worldwide could easily provide the trigger .

Had the ri oting spread to other cities, FEMA would have been empowered to ste p in. As it happened, major rioting only occurred in the Los An geles area, thus preventing a pretext for a FEMA response . Martial Law was averted but just barely. On July 5, 1987, the Miami Herald published reports on FEMA's new goals. The goal was to suspend the Constitution in the event of about any national crisis, such as nuclear war, violent and widespread “internal dissent”, or national “opposit ion” to a U.S. military invasion abroad or even legal protests . Lt. Col. North was the architect. National Security Directive Numb er 52 issued in August 1982, pertains to the \"Use of National Gu ard Troops to Quell Disturbances.\" The “Posse Comitatus Act” pre venting the Military from acting as police against US citizens, “is suspended”. It does not exist anymore. Do you know what th at really means? Spend some time and think about that one!! The Military can now function as regular police. Now w hat do you call that? Tell me, what has happened in many countries when the Military was allowed to control the citizens? That action, combined with the 800 concentration camps, mean exa ctly what? The crux of the problem is that FEMA had the power to turn the United States into a police state and it was done q uietly over a few years. Lt. Col. North virtually established the apparatus for dictatorship. Only the criticism of the Attorney Ge neral prevented the plans from being adopted years ago but intellig ence reports indicate that FEMA has a folder with 22 Executive O rders the President has just to sign to use in case of an eme rgency... even made up ones. It is believed those Executive Order s contain the framework of North's concepts... the stage is truly s et and the troops are on US soil. Most are Russian, Eastern European, Asian and a few other countries. I have personally talked to some in Nebraska, Wyoming and New Mexico. I refere nce this more later via URL’s.

Diana Reynolds, program director of the Edward R. Murrow Center, summed up the dangers of FEMA tod ay and the public reaction to Martial Law: \"It was James M adison's worst nightmare that a righteous faction would someday be strong enough to sweep away the Constitutional restraints designed by the framers to prevent the tyranny of centralized p ower, excessive privilege, an arbitrary governmental auth ority over the individual. These restraints, the balancing and che cking of powers among branches and layers of government, and the civil guarantees, would be the first casualties in a nati onal security state with Mr. Bush’s Civil Emergency Preparedness unleashed”. Nevertheless, there would be those who would welcom e NSC (National Security Council) into a fray, believing that increasing state police powers to emergency levels is the only way left to fight American's perceived enemy within. In the short run, a national security state would probably be a relief to those whose personal security and quality of life has been dimi nished by crime. And, as the general public watches the progr ession of institutional chaos and social decay, they too may be willing to pay the ultimate price, one crime free America for 200 years of democracy.\" Hitler did the same “security” scam. The first targets in any FEMA emergency would be Hispanics and Blacks, the FEMA orders call for them to be rounded up and detained and/or executed. Tax protesters, demonstra tors against government, military intervention outside U.S. bord ers, and people who maintain weapons in their homes are also targets. If a house-to-house search for weapons happens, which is certain to be part of Martial Law, and your 38 and shotgun is found, what will you do? Eight of us used to take on 100 NVA i n Vietnam and win!

Today I want to talk about how I see those d angers and that Congress can’t or won’t do anything about them . Of course, the Monday-morning quarterbacks are now explaining, with political overtones, what we should have done to pr event the 9/11 tragedy. Unfortunately, in doing so, foreign polic y changes are never considered. I have, for more than two decade s, been very interested in our post-World War II foreign policy. I have perceived it to be not in our best interest and hav e believed that it presented a serious danger to our security. I w as right. Our commercial interests and foreign policy are no longer separate...as bad as it is that average Americans a re forced to subsidize such a system, we additionally are placed in greater danger because of our policy of bombing nations tha t do not submit to our wishes. This generates hatred directe d toward America ...and exposes us to a greater threat of te rrorism, since this is the only vehicle our victims can use to ret aliate against a powerful military state ...the cost in terms of lost liberties and unnecessary exposure to terrorism is difficult to a ssess, but soon, it will become apparent to all of us that for eign interventionism was of “no” benefit to American cit izens, but instead took our liberties. My concerns are as relevant today as they were then. We should move with caution in this created post-9/11 period so we do not make our problems wor se overseas while our liberties have rapidly eroded at home. So far our post-9/11 policies have challenged the rule of law here at home, and our efforts against the al Qaeda have ess entially come up empty-handed... probably because they work for Ame rica’s secret society. The best we can tell now, instead of being in one place, the members of the al Qaeda are scattered ar ound the world, with more of them in allied Pakistan than in Afghanistan. Haven’t we learned that regardless of our massive f irepower... we cannot win a guerrilla war? Our efforts to find our enemies have put the CIA in 80 different countries.

That’s how it’s looking, folks. A country u nder martial law warring with the world. Where do you think this is all going to end up? But, my subject now is whether America has been a p olice state and how you and your family can live through it al l ... but mainly, how to really live through the coming major politic al changes as Martial Law creates a situation where supplies, etc . “will not be available” . I'm sure the large majority of Americans would answer this in the negative... “It can’t happen here” but just wait and see. Most would associate military patrols, m artial law and summary executions with a violent kind of police st ate, something obviously not present “yet” in our everyd ay activities. However, if you haven’t seen serious changes nearly every day, then you are in denial. The entire motive for me w riting this is to give basic pointers on your personal survival and t o understand why it will shortly become a shocking reality. The principal tool for sustaining a police state an d eroding it into Martial Law, even the most militant, is always econ omic control and punishment by denying disobedient citizens such things as jobs or places to live, and by levying fines and im prisonment. The military is more often used in the transition p hase to a totalitarian state. Maintenance for long periods is usually accomplished through economic controls on commercia l transactions, the use of all property, and politica l dissent. Peaceful control through these efforts can be achie ved without storm troopers on our street corners . “It has started as a prison without bars”. Terror and fear are used to achieve complacency and obedience, “especially” when citizens are deluded into believi ng they are still a free people. The changes, they are assured, will be minimal, short-lived, and necessary, such as those that occur in times of a declared war. Under these conditions, mo st citizens believe that once the war is won, the restrictions on their liberties"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Survive Martial Law 22 will be reversed. For the most part, however, after a declared war is over, the return to normalcy is never complete. In an undeclared war, without a precise enemy and therefo re no precise ending, returning to normalcy can prove ill usory. We have just concluded a century of wars, declared and undeclared, while at the same time responding to pu blic outcries for more economic equity. The question, as a result of these policies, is: \"Are we already living in a form of a police state?\" Of course we are and have been for years. Most police states, surprisingly, come about throug h the democratic process with “majority support” . They are sold a story that their “safety” is the reason for a ‘short term’ change. During a crisis, the rights of individuals and the minority are more easily trampled, which is more likely to condi tion a nation to become a police state/Martial Law rather than a military coup. Promised benefits initially seem to exceed the cost in Dollar’s or lost freedom. When people face terrorism or great f ear- from whatever source- the tendency to demand economic an d physical security over liberty and self-reliance pr oves irresistible. The masses are easily led to believe that security and liberty are mutually exclusive, and demand for security far exc eeds that for liberty. Once it's discovered that the desire for both econo mic and physical security that prompted the sacrifice of li berty inevitably led to the loss of prosperity and no real safety, i t's too late. Reversing the trend from authoritarian rule toward a free society becomes very difficult, takes a long time, and enta ils much suffering. Although dissolution of the Soviet empir e was relatively non-violent at the end, millions suffere d from police suppression and economic deprivation in the decades prior to 1989. Yet what about here in the United States? With res pect to a police state and certainly Martial Law, where are w e and where are we going? Let me make a few minor observations: Our government already keeps close tabs on just abo ut everything we do and requires official permission f or nearly all of our activities."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Survive Martial Law 23 One might take a look at our Capitol for any eviden ce of a police state. We see: barricades, metal detectors, police, and military soldiers at times, dogs, ID badges required for eve ry move, vehicles checked at airports and throughout the Cap itol. The people are totally disarmed, except for the police and the criminals... but worse yet, surveillance cameras in W ashington and other cities are everywhere to ensure our so-ca lled safety. This will be the reality for all American cities in a short time. The terrorist attacks only provided the “cover” for the do- gooders who have been planning for a long time to m onitor us \"for our own good.\" Cameras are used to spy on our drug habits, on our kids at school, on subway travelers, and on visitors to every government building or park. There's not much evidence of an open society in Washington, DC, yet most folks d o not complain - anything goes if it's for government-provided safet y and security. If this huge amount of information and technology i s placed in the hands of the government to catch the bad guys, one naturally asks ... What is the big deal? But it should be a big deal, because it eliminates the enjoyment of privacy that a free society holds dear. The personal information of law-abiding citiz ens can be used for reasons other than safety- including polit ical reasons. People control hurts law-abiding citizens much more than the law-breakers. Why are there now blimps with camera s that see through walls over many cities? What do you think they want to see? Social Security numbers are used to monitor our dai ly activities. The numbers are given at birth, and then are needed when we die and for everything in between. This allows governme nt record keeping of monstrous proportions, and accommodates the thugs who would steal others' identities for criminal pur poses. This has happened to me twice! This invasion of privacy has been compounded by the technology now available to those in government who enjoy monitoring and directing the a ctivities of others. Loss of personal privacy was a major proble m long before 9/11. Centralized control and regulations are required in a police state. Community and individual state regulations are not as threatening as the monolith of rules and regulation s written by Congress and the federal bureaucracy. Law and order has been federalized. So what do you think that means?"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Survive Martial Law 24 Almost all of our economic activities depend upon r eceiving the proper permits from the federal government. Transac tions involving guns, food, medicine, smoking, drinking, hiring, firing, wages, politically correct speech, land use, fishin g, hunting, buying a house, business mergers and acquisitions, selling stocks and bonds, and farming all require approval and strict regulation from our federal government. If this is not done properly and in a timely fashion, economic penaltie s and even imprisonment are likely consequences. Because government pays for much of our health care , (via Social Security, welfare and other public programs) it's conveniently argued that any habits or risk-taking that could harm one's health are the prerogative of the federa l government, and are to be regulated by explicit rules to keep m edical-care costs down. This same argument is used to require h elmets for riding motorcycles and bikes. Not only do we need a license to drive, but we also need special belts, bags, buzzers, seats and environmentally dic tated speed limits or a policeman will be pulling us over to le vy a fine, and he will be toting a gun for sure. The states do exactly as they're told by the federa l government, because they are threatened with the loss of tax do llars being returned to their state- dollars that should have n ever been sent to DC in the first place, let alone used to extort obe dience to a powerful federal government.

Information leaked from a government agency like th e FDA can make or break a company within minutes. If informat ion is leaked, even inadvertently, a company can be destro yed, and individuals involved in revealing government-monopo lized information can be sent to prison. Even though econ omic crimes are serious offenses in the United States, violent crimes sometimes evoke more sympathy and fewer penalties. Just look at the O.J. Simpson case as an example. Efforts to convict Bill Gates and others like him o f an economic crime are astounding, considering his contribution to economic progress, while sources used to screen out terroris t elements from our midst are tragically useless... probably bec ause we all know who the terrorists are.

If we believe only the official line from the administrat ion and proceed to change our whole system and have allowed others to undermine our constitutional rights, we may one day wake up to find that the attacks have increased , the numbers of those willing to commit suicide for their cause have grown, our f reedoms are diminished, and all this has contributed to making our economic problems irreparable. You just can’t keep on kicki ng an innocent dog. He will bite. The dollar cost of this \"war\" w ill turn out to be exorbitant, and the efficiency of our markets can b e undermined by the compromises placed on our liberties... but d o we care or have time to care? We've been brainwashed, folks a nd the hammer is about to fall because we have let it . Because you were playing little league, our country is going un der Martial Law!!! All this didn’t just happen by chance. “Yo u let it”! The question that one day must be answered is this: What if we had never placed our troops in Saudi Ara bia and Iraq and now Iran and God knows where else?

I can’t get into the whole sick mess in America bec ause I’d need a million pages for my outline. This, for me, is not a reactive position coming out of all the insane controls we've allowed, but rather is an arg ument I've made for decades, claiming that meddling in the aff airs of others is dangerous to our security and actually reduces o ur ability to defend ourselves. We can't seem to mind our own bu siness . Financial interests of our international corporatio ns, oil companies, and banks, along with the military-indus trial complex, are sure to remain a deciding influence on our policies but we too will under the massive thumb of those \"i n charge\"... the real elite money men who control everything. M ost don’t know they exist but they do. President Kennedy faced an even greater threat in O ctober 1962, and from a powerful force. The Soviet/Cuban terrori st threat with nuclear missiles only 90 miles off our shores was w isely defused by Kennedy's capitulating and removing missiles fro m Turkey on the Soviet border. Kennedy deserved the praise he r eceived for the way he handled the nuclear standoff with the So viets. This concession most likely prevented a nuclear exchange and proved that “taking a step back” from a failed policy is beneficial, yet how one does so is crucial. The answer is to do it diplomatically-- that's what diplomats are supposed to do . He had other great ideas. One was to eliminate the Fe deral Reserve for which it has been written many times, that beca use of messing with the holders of the world’s money, he w as murdered. Today's conditions may well be exactly w hat our world commercial interests want. It's now easy for us to go into the Philippines, Columbia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, o r wherever in pursuit of so-called terrorists. No questions are a sked by the media or the politicians-- only cheers. Put in thes e terms, who can object? We all despise the tactics of the terro rists , so the nature of the response is not to be questioned! J ust wait a short while and one morning you will certainly wake up to violent Martial Law. The plans are laid, the troops are re ady, and the minds of many are conditioned for mass murder and o n and on."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Survive Martial Law 32 A growing number of Americans are concluding that t he threat we now face comes more as a consequence of our fore ign policy than because the bad guys envy our freedoms and pro sperity. How many terrorist attacks have been directed towar d Switzerland, Australia, Canada, or Sweden? They too are rich and free, and would be easy targets, but the Islamic fu ndamentalists see no purpose in doing so. They are free countrie s and will remain so but not for long. The New World Order wi ll devour them also. The Military control of the USA has bee n in the making for many years and is finally ready to launc h. According to all the pundits, we are expected to ch ampion this big-government approach, and if we don't jolly well like it, we will be tagged \"unpatriotic.\" The fear that permeates ou r country cries out for something to be done in response to a lmost daily warnings of the “next attack” . If it's not a real attack, then it's a theoretical one; one where the bomb could well be o nly in the mind of a potential terrorist or more likely, a pol itician... but it will do the same thing. It will drive us to our protect or but we don't realize it will be at the point of a gun. There is no need for us to be forced to choose betw een security and freedom. Giving up freedom does not provide gre ater security. Preserving and better understanding freed om can. Sadly today, many are anxious to give up freedom in response to real and generated fears... so that's what we will all get! The plans for a first strike supposedly against a p otential foreign government should alarm all Americans. If we do not resist this power the President is assuming, our President, thr ough executive orders, can start a war anyplace, anytime , against anyone he chooses, for any reason, without congress ional approval. This is a tragic usurpation of the war po wer by the executive branch from the legislative branch, with Congress being all too accommodating. However, Mr. Bush has “Directive 51” in his back pocket which is his ticket to do an ything he chooses. Removing the power of the executive branch to wage war, as was done through our revolution and the writing of the Constitution, is now being casually sacrificed on the altar of “s ecurity” . In a"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Survive Martial Law 33 free society, and certainly in the constitutional r epublic we have been given, it should never be assumed that the Pre sident alone can take it upon himself to wage war whenever he pl eases. So where we’re you 6 years ago when we all should have exercised taking control back for our country. Yes, not doin g a damn thing! Face it... you were playing and allowing power hungry men to make the rules and now I am going to try to save yo ur life because that is the position we are facing. I sugg est you listen! Planned assassination, a preemptive strike policy “ without proof” of any threat, and a vague definition of ter rorism may work for us as long as we're king of the hill, but one must assume every other nation will naturally use our de finition of policy as justification for dealing with their neig hbors. India can justify a first strike against Pakistan, China aga inst India or Taiwan, as well as many other such examples. This n ew Policy, will make the world dangerous and America as we kno w it will be a vague memory as many of us are confined, killed a nd forced into serving the elite. There’s a name for the end of all this, “The New World Order”. So, is America now an authoritarian police state? But our concerns ought to be whether we have laid t he foundation of a more docile police state, but reall y, what will we do during the transition of government? In a word... how will you stay alive and that’s what this is all leading up to. The love of liberty has been so diminished that we tolerate intrusions into our privacies today that would have been abhorred j ust a few years ago. Tolerance of inconvenience to our liberties is not uncommon when both personal and economic fear persi sts. The sacrifices being made to our liberties will surely usher in a system of government that will please only those wh o enjoy being in charge of running other people's lives. When the government keeps detailed records on every move we make and we either need advance permission for ever ything we do or are penalized for not knowing what the rules are, America is declared a Police State/Martial Law .

War will be the prerogative of the administration. Civi l liberties will be suspended and their prosecution will not be carried out by an independent judiciary. In a police state, this bec omes common practice rather than a rare incident... So forget i t and use your energy for your own survival because the momentum t owards the monolithic state cannot be reversed. There will be a quite a few months or longer of transition where \"FOOD\" will be nearly impossible to get. Look today at what's happened worldwide to the main food stores like Wheat, Corn, Barley, Rice and many other commodities. There is a serious famine comin g in 2008. The USA used to have a 7 year supply of basic food surplus but it's now less than12 weeks!!! What I am advising, since electric and gas will likely be unavailable at times, is to buy as many hundreds of dollars of canned foods and other seale d things listed below. Buy all you can but scrape up the mo ney, cash CD’s, borrow, beg but get the money and “do it now or your family will likely starve to death during the trans ition period”. It will last many months. Canned chili is good as is baked beans. Beans are protein so will keep you alive. Get seve ral quart jars and sprouter lids and about 10 pounds of sprouts pe r person. They are packed with nutrients up to the 7 th day when the value decreases. You need the nutrients they provide. B uy many pounds of each of Alfalfa, Radish, Red Clover, Broc coli and Mung seeds. That’s all. If in cold weather, keep the jars inside your coat next to your body. Sprouts are among the very best foods. Survive, damn it! Buy lots of dried fruits , many big bags or boxes of dry milk, lots and lots of nuts, 30 pou nds of rolled oats (soak in water and eat) with dry milk, molasse s, sugar and anything that doesn’t require cooking. If you can, get enough for a year. Get a very good multiple vitamin like Mega food for each person. If water is short in your area buy a basem ent full of 5 gallon plastic cans and if water is available, get a good gravity filter (British Berkefeld is best). Don't wait unt il tomorrow... do it today. Go to several grocery stores and fill carts and carts with canned or boxed, dried foods and anything you can e at without preparation but only opening the can or package... t hat is where your real security will lie. It is very critical y ou do this immediately because you can’t stop this horrid machine. Get a ll the food you can because your extended family will probably not have anything. You can barter with it. Don’t fill your freezer because the chance of electricity going off is grea t if even for a short time.

When the word goes out there will be a run on t he stores and you and your family will have no help and will slowly die if you don’t get ready well in advance of when the ham mer falls! It’s happened in many countries and it’s here in Am erica NOW... be prepared!!! VERY IMPORTANT... NEVER TELL A SOUL Y OU HAVE STORED FOODS. Crush, tear any evidence of it and hide it or bury smashed cans. Don’t leave evidence you hav e food. Storing it in the insulation of your attic is a goo d place to put it. Stash it in several places, even away from your hom e because excess supplies will be taken in the door to door s earches. Use paper plates (buy hundreds and plastic spoons and b ury these too). DON’T TRUST EVEN YOUR MOTHER . She could tell her friend who might tell her son who would tell the gu y up the street and you guess it from there. Remember, when people are severely hungry they are different people. They wi ll easily kill you for your supplies and if you open your big mout h, you’ll be responsible for anything that happens... so shut up s tarting right now. Never say one word!! Keep your family quiet but better not to tell children, especially teens... never, under any circumstances, tell a teen or child anything about your stores. Get plenty of aspirin and needed medications as bes t you can. Tell your Doctor you’re going to Burma for 8 months and get loaded up and conserve. Take less. Sleeping bags for warmth if that’s a concern. Be sure to have the best can ope ner available. Think of any just basics you need for the transitio n period until things level off. “Don’t, and I mean don’t eat too much” . If others see you healthy while everyone is suffering, they’ll wonder why so BE CAREFULL. We will have a 2 year s upply, well hidden and a British Berkefeld water filter, p robably the best around for about $175. You may as well forget abou t going to a different country because they will be controlled b y the New World Order soon. Save yourself and the life of yo ur family! Be one of the survivors. Since you didn’t do anything when you could, it’s too late. Try to stay alive and learn to love each other. I went to a regular grocery last night and found pl enty of things to eat without cooking. In the beginning, however, there could be gas and electric. As long as you can cook, eat dry beans and spiced rice with a little ground beef. Use all the things you can cook first so have plenty. There is a list below o f what I found but figure on about “ 300-360 pounds per 6 months for one person” . Calculate your own list as each will be different .

A great place to hide things is in the insulation in your attic. Ot herwise, buy large plastic containers and your shovel and go do hard w ork. Dig holes in your yard in many places (keep a detailed map in a safe place and list what you have where) then put the co ntainers in and cover up and replace the grass or garden mix. It’s that simple. I’ve been in places I just knew had foods stored but had no idea where so didn’t pursue it. Some things to eat while your stove works are: -Hard vegetables like carrots, potatoes, have lots of hard apples , winter squash, sweet potatoes, rice and beans toget her with a little meat and NO PRPARED and easy food. It’s gar bage and will suck your health. Keep it basic and learn to eat the same things over and over. Eat dry peas like lentils and split peas with a li ttle ham. Cook a roast if you must and have that meatlo af while you can but be sure you have a few hundred pounds of dr y beans(you can even sprout them) and the same for ri ce... more if you can.

The day is coming when their will be a run on stores and you’ll be ready. Do it NOW!!! About 700 plus pounds per person for a year and access to a gallon of wat er a day.
