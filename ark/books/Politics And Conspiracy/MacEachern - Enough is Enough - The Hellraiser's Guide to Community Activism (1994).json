The job confronting yo u seems enormous, almost impos- sible. But little by little, momentum builds. More and more people join your campaign. The media begin covering your concerns. Pol- iticians take your requests seriously, and donors even give you money so you can keep on organizing. You don't win every battle, but you win enough of them. And eventually, you make a difference. Waste dumps get closed down, employees go back to work , drug dealers move away. By now, the realization has hit y ou. The more \"hell\" you raise. the more powerful you become. And with that power come con- crete improvements in your life a nd the lives of others in your community. This book is about \"raising hell.\" It had its genesis in the NIMBY (Not In My Backyard) m ovement that energized so many environmental struggles over the last two decades. But just like ac- tivism itself, the concept for the book evolved from a list of strictly defensive actions into a presenta tion of preemptive strategies and tactics for true social change. Thus, Enough Is Enough: The Hellraiser's Guide to Community Activism offers both ways to fight back and a course to fight for, a tool to empower people so that they not only can protect the mselves from undesirable devel- opments but pursue their own constructive objectives. Beyond NIMBY The Oxford Dictionary of New Words claims that the term NIMBY was first used around 1980 as a derogatory label for the antinuclear movement and other citizen efforts that were perceived to oppose any large local construction project. NIMBY made Brit- ish headlines when outspoken envi ronmental secretary Nicholas Ridley protested the construction of a housing development near one of his homes and a walking tr ail near another. (Ridley's ironic outcry came shortly after he mock ed members of Parliament from the Tory party for themselves having NIMBY attitudes toward housing projects.) The press subseque ntly characterized citizens as suffering from the \"NIMBY syndrome\" whenever they opposed the construction or operation of a facility that was thought to be dangerous or threatening, partic ularly because it was located near their homes. The phrase became more popular in the United States in the 1980s, as housewives and blue- and white-collar workers in inner cities, the suburbs, and rural areas began organizing to find and"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"I NTRODUCTION XV clean up toxic waste sites and othe r facilities that were believed to pose an environmental or health hazard to them and their children. As places like Love Canal* became the subject of anxious din- nertime conversation, NIMBY began catching on. The battles started focusing not only on toxic dumps and power plants but also on chemical manufacturing operations, oil drilling facilities, and prisons; the location of crack hous es; the shutdown of employment centers; the closing of schools. The concept of NIMBY receives ju stified criticism when it is invoked hypocritically to preserve an elite, privileged sanctuary unconnected to the general good, in the manner of British environ- mental secretary Nicholas Ridley. But NIMBY also properly re- flects a venerable American tradition: the right of individual citizens to protect their safety and way of life by uniting in a com- mon cause. For many people, those concerns have led them to expand the concept of \"backyard\" to include community and country. To some degree, that accounts for the increasing success activists have en- joyed in rallying people to the larger campaigns they wage— because more and more national and even global issues are being perceived as local. John Muir, th e naturalist who founded the Si- erra Club a hundred years ago. once sagely observed, \"Everything in the universe is hitched to everything else.\" Today, many people know what he meant. Which is why the nineties' corollary to Muir's statement—\"Think globall y, act locally\"—makes more and more sense. The point isn't to shift responsibility for shouldering the problem somewhere else but to reduce the existence of the problem over all. If none of us al low a toxic waste dump to be lo- cated in our own backyard, perhaps we'll get to broader toxics-use reduction nationwide. I hope this book will give you a sense of hope, help you seize the initiative, and leave you with the firm belief that you can make a difference. It is written particularly for individuals and groups who have no money, no experience, and no power, but who are rich in commitment, determination, grit—and, I hope, a sense of humor. *Love Canal is a neighborhood in Niagara Falls. New York.

Each step involves maintaining a clear vision of the whole process—in other words, you have to know what your end goal is before you can figure out what steps will get you there. So think of this book as a series of building blocks. The \"blocks\" you use to build a strong foundation can be found in Part I, \"Laying the Foundation: An Overview of Successful Hell- Raising.\" These include tips on how to pick the \"right\" issue (Chapter 1), develop an organizi ng strategy (Chapter 2), take ad- vantage of many available organizi ng tactics (Chapter 3), build a potent organization (Chapter 4). a nd raise the money you need to keep going (Chapter 5). A detailed case study sets the stage for the first four chapters; it focuses on the inspiring battles the Mothers of East Los Angeles waged to def eat the construction of a prison, a hazardous waste incinerator, and other unwanted projects in their neighborhood. Chapter 5, \"Fund-raising,\" contains many stories that demonstrate how versatile and lucrative grass roots strategies to raise money can be. Part II, \"The Building Blocks.\" offers strategies and tactics you can use to build on your organizi ng foundation and achieve your goals. This section is divided into specific chapters that deal with communications (Chapter 6), lobbyi ng (Chapter 7), and action at the polls (Chapter 8). Each of th ese chapters begins with a well- developed case study intended to he lp you understand how to use the \"building block\" being discussed. Although each case study is desi gned to highlight one topic in particular, every story inevitably touches on many other topics as well, since when it comes to organizing, nothing happens in a vac- uum. Thus, while the focus of the fi rst story in Chapter 1 is pri- marily about the efforts of the Mothers of East Los Angeles to organize opposition to the construction of a prison in their neigh- borhood, you'll also read about th e savvy media tactics they used to rally the general public in support of their cause, and how they successfully lobbied their state legislature to keep the prison out. And while the lead story in Chapte r 8, \"Action at the Polls,\" re- counts the pins-and-needles referendum campaign waged over handgun control in the state of Maryland, it also describes the"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"I NTRODUCTION xvii breathtaking tactics activists on both sides of the issue used to raise money and manipulate public opinion through the media. Sprinkled throughout each chapter are shorter examples further illustrating how local hell-raisers effectively used the tool being highlighted in that chapter. Most of the chapters also contain \"Step by Step\" checklists that summari ze at a glance the actions you need to consider to successfully undertake the activity being dis- cussed. \"Check It Out\" boxes o ffer immediate sources of addi- tional information. And \"Do's a nd Don'ts\" at the end of each chapter review essential observations and recommendations. In the appendix, \"Ammunition and A llies,\" you'll find more re- sources to investigate and some organizations you may be able to turn to for help, as well as a co mplete relisting of the sources of- fered in \"Check It Out\" boxes. You'll gel the most out of the book by reading it all the way through, then going back to specific sections as questions arise about your own organizing efforts. One word of caution: All of the phone numbers and addresses included in this book were verified at the time we went to press. But that doesn't mean that they haven't changed. If you can't reach an organization by using the info rmation we've listed, don't give up right away. Check with directory assistance in the metropolitan area where the group is supposed to be located.

When you start to do more than complain, you've become an activist. Most people are community activists whether they know it or not. Voting is an activist act; so is joining the PTA, cleaning up a local park, participating in a ne ighborhood crime watch, or holding a yard sale to raise money for the homeless. But, although lone deeds of community activism—such as the casting of a single vote on election day—can certainly have an important impact, true so- cial change usually occurs only after individual activists begin working together to persuade othe rs to join with them in some common cause. In other words, they organize. But what exactly does that mean? Organizing for change is a little like organizing other, simpler things in your life, like Thanksgiving dinner. First, you focus on the issue: Thanksgiving is coming and you're hosting the family dinner— but complications are involved (such as Aunt Matilda's refusal to eat turkey and the old feud be- tween Cousin Fred and Uncle Bert). So you figure out a strategy— what you're going to serve when, how long it's going to take to prepare, and who you're going to invite. Next you choose the right tools—the ingredients you need fo r your entree, vegetable, side dish, and dessert; the right pots and pans in which to prepare the meal; the dishes on which to se rve it. Finally, you begin cooking. Throughout, you build and nurtur e your organization—in this case, your family. You discuss what you're planning to fix and ask others for menu suggestions, such as whether you should switch from turkey to ham, beef, or even a vegetarian dish. You ask for help in inviting your guests, s hopping, cleaning the house, and set- 3"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"4 L AYING THE F OUNDATION ting the table. You tell stories and jokes to keep spirits up when the tasks start to get a little tedious. And when the meal is over and all your guests have gone ho me, you sit down togeth er with your feet up and talk about what you're goi ng to do or prepare differently next year. Community organizing in volves exactly the same planning and implementation skills. What makes it different is the fact that so many more people are involved, that these people may be moti- vated by many different (and conf licting) factors, and that most community organizing battles are ju st that: conflicts that pit one side against another in confrontat ions that can be extremely time- consuming, expensive, and even demo ralizing. It's a lot tougher to organize fifty people to oppose the closing of a school than it is to decide whether to serve turkey or ha m, or whether to invite just the immediate family or all the in-laws. As John O'Connor, the founder of the National Toxics Cam- paign, once put it, \"Organizing is the power to en list and lead peo- ple in ways that are bold and dram atic. It is the ability to challenge people's limitations and help them overcome those limitations. It is an understanding of human nature and an ability to engage people in action with precise timing. It is good judgment and organiza- tional skill, but it is also the abilit y to have fun as you get there.\"* In other words, it's not simple— but it can be done. And for most activists, it must be done if their communitie s are to become safer, healthier, and more humane. Most community organizing re volves around \"issue cam- paigns\"; that is, campaigns that reflect shared fundamental values and attempt to change the status quo by setting and pursuing spe- cific goals and objectives. A gr oup of citizens might organize themselves into a community activist association because they're worried that drug trafficking is endangering th eir neighborhood, then create and implement a \"citiz en's patrol\" program to help po- lice eradicate drug dealers and clea n out crack houses. Residents of a community who oppose the placem ent of a new incinerator in their area because they fear its emissions could endanger their health may organize an issue campa ign to ban its construction and propose alternative measures to reduce solid waste.

Community organizing doesn't always involve candidates for office or elected offici als. But it is almost always political in the sense that there usua lly are two conflicting sides maneuvering be- hind the scenes and in public to advance their positions and achieve their goals and objectiv es. Decisions about whether to fund an AIDS clinic, provide schoo l lunches, or institute a jobs training program for disadvantaged youths often are made in a po- litical context. The stronger the disagreement over a proposal, the more political the proposal becomes. Community activism almost alw ays involves the law—obeying it, changing it, and even breaking it. Yes. while this book does not necessarily advoca te using illegal tactics to achieve social change, it recognizes that efforts to bring about change are not always underta ken in ways that are condoned by the American justice system—b ut that still have a needed im- pact on the public and on deci sion makers. When Greenpeace ille- gally trespasses on the property of a corporation it believes is polluting the environment in order to unfurl a banner or plug a dis- charge pipe, the perpetrators usua lly are arrested for breaking the law. But Greenpeace activists would argue—and convincingly so—that such civil disobedience is the only way they can draw at- tention to the problem and achiev e their goals of social change. According to the nationally renowned Midwes t Academy, a Chicago-based training center for grass roots activists, the most successful campaigns are those that achieve three \"principles of di- rect action\": 1. They win real, immediate, an d concrete improvements in people's lives. 2. They give people a sens e of their own power. 3. They alter the relations of po wer, allowing grass roots orga- nizations to become key players in the decisions that affect their communities.* As the stories in this book can at test, people who turn to citizen activism as a way of \"raising hell\" help determine their own future by taking charge of it.

GETTING STARTED THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION WAS NO ACCIDENT—IT WAS ORGANIZED E VERY GREAT SOCIAL reformation—from the American Revolution to the rise of the labor, women's, and civil rights movements; to com- munity struggles for environmental justice, improved health care, and drug- and crime-free neighborhoods—has occurred because in- dividuals or organizations got to gether to change the system. Such movements aren't a thing of the past. Today, every day of the week, hundreds if not thousands of citizens groups across the United States determine to take steps to improve their lives and en- hance the well-being of their communities. Most organizing efforts start with two questions: \"What in the world is going on?\" and \"What can I do to remedy it?\" If you're unusually lucky, the problem you're tr ying to solve can be fixed in the course of a few phone calls or by writing a couple of letters.

For the Latinos of East Los Angeles, church also plays a vital role in preserving the safety and integrity of their community: It has become a place to mobilize and plan, to paint signs bearing strong mes- sages, and to empower one another. In April of 1985, Father John Moretta of the commu- nity's Resurrection Catholic Church asked two hundred mothers in the congregation to stay after mass. When the surprised group gathered in the sanctuary, the concerned priest quietly unloaded some disheartening news: The state was planning to build a 1,450-bed prison in their community—the eighth lockup facility in the neighbor- Erlinda Robles (left), Aurora Castillo and Henrietta Castillo, decked in their white scarves, pause at a Mothers of East Los Angeles demonstration at the California Department of Correc- tions in October of 1987.

Almost overnight, the church became an organiz- ing center for the determined mothers of a low-income, overcrowded barrio that, already plagued by some of the worst pollution and crime in the nation, desperately sought to shelter itself from additional degradation. An Unwanted Distinction Father Moretta and Frank Villalobos, a local architect, had been involved in an effo rt by businessmen and mer- chants in the community to oppose the prison since 1984—months before the Mothers got involved. In fact, the Coalition Against the Pr ison had lobbied against the proposal during the spring 1985 legislative session, but made little progress. One da y Assemblywoman Gloria Molina, a coalition member who eventually became a Mother, surveyed the groups of businessmen who made up the coalition and asked. \"Where are the women?\" Villalobos and Moretta co nferred and agreed. \"The press wouldn't listen to us : we're suits. We thought, why don't we bring the gra ss roots into the picture?\" Villalobos recalled. When Father Moretta gath ered the matrons of the community in April, his an nouncement left them in shock. The proposed prison would give East L.A. the dubious distinction of hosti ng the largest concentration of lockup facilities in the free world. \"We didn't want our community turned into a penal colony!\" exclaimed Aurora Castillo, spokespers on for the Mothers. \"We were, figuratively speaking, up in arms. The ladies kept saying Ya basta! No way!\" The knowing priest, who ha d a reputation as a peace- ful activist, had targeted th e right group to fight the prison: all two hundred mothers immediately signed up to help. \"Father knew that it was time to get the ladies involved,\" Castillo observed. \"The mother is the soul of the Latino family, the heartbea t is the children. The head is the father, and he is looke d upon with great respect and admiration, but the mo ther rules the roost.\" They began demonstrating the next day on Olympic Boulevard Bridge, a highly vi sible location just a block away from the proposed prison site.

Close to five hundred people showed up for the first march—and, remembered Villalobos, \"With the scarves, it looked like twice as many people!\" The marches turned into w eekly, rain-or-shine events. One Monday Father Moretta, with his eye on an ap- proaching thunderstorm, suggested that they cancel that evening's demonstration. Th e Mothers responded with a determined chorus: \"We have umbrellas!\" The number of demonstrators grew weekly: by August, seven thousand were participating each Monday at seven P . M . sharp. The Strategy: Make News Villalobos, Moretta and the Mo thers knew that to defeat the prison plan they would have to enlist the rest of the community—and that the media would energize the re- cruiting drive. They also realized thai they had the potential—given the hundreds of Latino mothers dem- onstrating on the bridge—to attract considerable atten- tion. \"At first the media ignored us,\" Castillo said, but before long, radio, TV, and local newspapers sent re- porters to check out the commotion. The press asked, 'Who are these ladies?' \" chuckled Villalobos. \"And Father said, 'These are the mothers of East Los Angeles!'\" The name stuck. The third weekly march became the activists' tele- vision debut. The placard-bearing women made a com- pelling visual for TV cameras. Young mothers in casual garb marched alongside protes ters like Castillo, who, in a cardigan sweater, skirt, and dress shoes, her black hair streaked with gray, still managed to look dignified while carrying a sign reading \"IS THIS A DEAL ?\" The Mothers soon became media savvy, alerting re- porters when celebrities indicated that they planned to march, issuing press releases, and printing up flyers, which they distributed at churches, businesses, stores, markets, and even schools, i nviting every citizen in Cal- ifornia to participate.

Cars driving over the bridge honked their approval and gave the thumbs-up sign to the Mothers, who bran- dished signs reading \" WE NEED SCHOOLS , NOT PRISONS \" and \" DON ' T FENCE us IN .\" Eventually the marches had to be discontinued—participation had grown so large that safety became a problem. But the Mothers continued to meet two or three times a week at the Resurrection school hall or annex, plotting to beat the state and pre- serve what little remained of East L.A.'s integrity and self-respect as a community.

They needed to defeat the prison proposal at its origin. Villalobos coordinated a four-hundred-mile bus trip to Sacramento, where the Mothers planned to lobby legis- lators. \"We were so naive when we started. We had no idea how to lobby!\" rememb ers Castillo. But two hun- dred Mothers and children were willing to learn quickly. After a brief, intense discussion of legislative proce- dures and how to influence the lawmakers, the group traveled all night in three rented buses to the state cap- itol. They crowded into the slate senate chamber the next day, waving their signs, just as the lawmakers were slated to discuss a bill ordering that the prison be built. More Mothers were present than there was standing room available. \"The legislators were unnerved by the sight of all those Mothers and children,\" chuckled Castillo. The ac- tivists energetically waved their signs and spoke to the lawmakers, urging them to vote against the bill. A press conference was hastily arra nged, and the Mothers ap- peared on local TV to denounce the prison plans. The group traveled to Sacramento from Los Angeles an av- erage of twice a week after that—every time the bill was slated for discussion. Th e first few trips were paid for with $3,000 raised at a pa ncake breakfast. Later, the lengthy bus rides evolved into short plane trips funded by concerned local businesses. The media covered every trip. \"After a while, every time Governor George Deuk- mejian [a strong proponent of the prison] burped, they called us to find out our reaction,\" laughed Castillo. Working with Others The Mothers' inexperience as activists, though daunt- ing, in some ways worked to their benefit. The women supplied the soul the movement needed, while the Coa- lition Against the Prison provided monetary support and a suitably professional imag e. \"They said, 'You get the Mothers, we'll do the rest,' \" Castillo remembers.

Meanwhile. a member of the state assembly, Lucille Roybal-Allard (who was later elected to Co ngress), was gearing up to propose legislation that would shift the East L.A. prison money to another prison that was about to open in Lan- caster County. The steady grass roots opposition the zealous women mounted in th e interest of their chil- dren's and grandchildren's fu tures finally swayed law- makers. After a previous ve to, Governor Pete Wilson, Deukmejian's successor, si gned a bill killing the 1987 mandate for the East L.A. prison. The date was Septem- ber 16, 1992—Mexican Ind ependence Day.

The Mothers now meet on the last Tuesday of each month. Their current roster of members contains more than four hundred names. \"If you are a mother and live in East Los Angeles, you'r e a Mother,\" Castillo says. Being concerned citizens in a largely ethnic community means no time for rest; in 1988, while the prison battle was in full swing, Californ ia Thermal Treatment Ser- vices (CTTS) of Garden Grove announced plans to build a hazardous waste incinera tor in the nearby city of Vernon. This project would also make East Los Angeles a dubious trendsetter as th e first metropolitan area to host a commercial hazard ous waste incinerator. The Mothers and several stat e politicians with whom they were working to defeat the prison proposal claimed discrimination against East L. A. As evidence, they cited a report prepared by Cerrell and Associates, a consult- ing firm based in L.A., and commissioned by the federal government that recommend ed targeting low-income communities for potentially unacceptable projects be- cause such locales frequently lack the resources to fight back.

The group incorporated so they could solicit tax- deductible contributions fro m businesses. Following le- gal advice from the Natural Resources Defense Council, another environmental organization, the community sued CTTS in October 1989 for failing to file an envi- ronmental impact statement (EIS). Three years later, CTTS abandoned its incinerator plans when the Califor- nia Supreme Court upheld a lower court's ruling requir- ing the EIS. The Mothers of East L.A. also succeeded in blocking a second waste incinerator and an above-ground oil pipeline that had been proposed to run through their community. They attribute their successes in part to grim determination and in part to their ability to use tac- tics other than grass roots demonstrations to accomplish their goals. \"They're now considered one of the most powerful groups in Los Angeles. They can make or break a politician,\" Villalobos boasts. Working to get \"their people \" elected to public office has also become an important part of the Mothers' orga- nizing strategy. First, they campaign to encourage local people to become citizens if they are immigrants, then to register, then to vote, and in some cases to run for of- fice themselves. Two former Mothers have achieved elected positions of consider able influence: Congress- woman Roybal-Allard and Gloria Molina, who became county supervisor. Approximately 26 percent of Califor- nia's population is Latino, a nd with the Mothers' help, says Castillo, \"we now have grass roots representation. More and more Latinos are voting, and more are being elected. Sooner or later our children—because of the percentages—are going to run this state.\" It is only fitting that the Mothers are headquartered in their place of worship, becau se, as Father Moretta put it when he called that first meeting in 1985, to win their battles would take a miracle."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"G ETTING S TARTED 15 WHY DID THEY WIN?

When they sat down and figure d out what it would take to win—in terms of people, mone y, time, and tactics—they felt they could prevail, even though victory wouldn't occur overnight. 2. They had a good strategy. The Mothers anticipated what was likely to happen and mapped out ho w they were going to achieve their goals. At the same time, their approach was flexible enough to allow fo r unexpected developments, and realistic in reflecting what people could and could not do. Perhaps most important, their strategy involved each mem- ber every step of the way, empowering all of the Mothers until they knew they could fight—and win. 3. They used the right tactics. They identified specific actions—such as the marches and other media events, their collaboration with the antipriso n coalition, and their lobby- ing of the state legislature—that helped move their issue along while building their organization into a solid institu- tion.

Are you working on a winning is sue or just spinning your wheels? The question isn't abou t values—whether or not the issue intrin- sically merits your attention or concern. Ultimately, it's about re- sources. You can't tackle every i ssue, and you probably can't win every campaign you wage. Given the fact that most activist groups are underfunded, understaffed, a nd overcommitted, organizations need to pick their fights carefully. Waging one campaign success- fully is a better social change stra tegy than struggling through sev- eral worthwhile— but losing—ones. The following questions may hel p you whittle down the issues you care about into the one or two you should pursue now. • Do people feel strongly enough about the issue to want to work on its behalf? Is this an issue you expect many people to rally around? Or is it going to be tough to round up even ten volunteers? • Will working on this issue st rengthen your organization? Will it involve people in the fi ght, empower your members, and build team spirit? • Does the issue affect a lot of people, especially those who have the potential to become members in your group? Or will its impact be felt by only a few \"special interests\" who care little for your ongoing work? • Does the issue have a cl ear right and wrong side? Or are there many possible positions th at confuse potential support- ers and make it more difficult to recruit volunteers and raise money? As important as they may be, i ssues that are underrated, divi- sive, of consequence to just a few, or ambiguous shouldn't be a priority for community groups with scarce funds or resources; put these issues on your organizati onal back burner until they become more compelling to your members and the public. Then return to the list of issu es that now seem winnable, and prioritize again. Consider the following factors: • Timing. How immediate is the issue? Must you act now be- cause a decision is due in the legislature or by the city coun- cil? Like the Mothers of East L.A., are you faced with the"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"G ETTING S TARTED 17 impending construction of a facility you want kept out of your neighborhood or perhaps no t built at all? What other time considerations are driving you to tackle this issue sooner rather than later? • Fund-raising. Waging any campaign takes money, and some issues are simply much easier to fund-raise around than oth- ers. Are the donors in your co mmunity—whether they be in- dividual citizens, foundations, corporations, churches, or civic associations—willing to support one issue campaign over another? • Organizational goals and objectives. Do your priority is- sues effectively complement and advance the overall mission of your group? If clarifying any of these consid erations isn't obvious, you can get help from several sources. Review newspaper and magazine ar- ticles for a sense of where the i ssue is being placed on the public agenda. Talk with elected official s and directors and staff at gov- ernmental agencies to identify when issues will be subject to pub- lic debates and votes. Meet with the legislative directors of governmental committees to determine how much help or hin- drance they'll be. Ask other organizations with whom you are working for their advice. Check with lawyers (or law students) to see if a law you think needs passing is already on the books; maybe what it really needs is to be enforced. Make the best informed decision s you can by learning every- thing possible about the issues you're considering working on. Check the library, governmental agencies, and other organiza- tions. Consult with professors and graduate students at local uni- versities. Speak with journalists who cover the topic. The appendix of this book references other book s, reports, and organizations that can also help. Even when you've prioritized the issues, done the research, de- veloped the strategy, and chosen the tactics, you can never be sure you'll win the battles you choose to fight. (Yogi Berra, the famed manager of both the New York Yankees and the Mets, used to say \"It ain't over till it's over,\" and that's as true of most issue cam- paigns as it is of baseball game s.) What you can do is improve your chances significantly by giving yourself advantages from the start—and organizing around issues th at you have a chance of win- ning."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"18 L AYING THE F OUNDATION ISSUE DO's and DON'Ts • Do prioritize your issues. Focus on those around which you can recruit volunteers, raise money, and achieve your overall goals and objectives. • Don't try to tackle every issue at once.

DEVELOPING YOUR STRATEGY A STRATEGY is a comprehensive plan, formulated in advance of the action at which it is aimed, that identifies the combination of steps needed to achieve specific goals and objectives. Webster's New World Dictionary compares developing a strategy to \"maneuvering forces into the most advantageous position prior to actual engage- ment with the enemy.\" Basically, it's the virtual opposite of oper- ating by the seat of your pants. WHAT MAKES A STRATEGY EFFECTIVE? The operative words are \"advance planning.\" A solid strategy is thought through in advance to allow planning for resource needs and to help identify specific tactic s that are needed to win. It an- ticipates opportunities and pitfalls, prep aring organizers to take full advantage of beneficial circumstances while minimizing the fallout from potential roadblocks. Developi ng a strategy readies organiz- ers to dispatch volunteers, staff, money, equipment, and other as- sets where they are needed when they are needed without wasting"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"20 L AYING THE F OUNDATION time. A good strategy keeps a campaign movi ng forward, creating the momentum needed to win. An effective strategy also uses people's skills to best advantage. It remains flexible to allow fo r unexpected developments. And it reflects a realistic understanding of what members can and can't do. Strategies that achieve their obj ectives have six characteristics in common: 1. Long-range goal. An effective strategy sets out to achieve a specific mission. In creasing the availability of housing, creating a new park, teaching ch ildren to read, reducing in- fant mortality, and improving public health are examples of the many kinds of long-range goals community activists have set for themselv es over the decades. 2. Short-term goal. It is almost impossible to realize a long- range goal in one fell swoop. Usually, you have to pursue a series of short-term goals th at help maintain the momen- tum needed to reach your long-term goal. For example, suppose a community's long-ter m goal is to build a new park. A short-term goal might be to get a majority of the community's residents to support having a park. A second short-term goal might be to get the city counc il to set aside the land. A third might be to raise the money for play- ground equipment. When all these short-term goals are achieved, you can fulfill your long-term goal of building the park. 3. Organizational concerns. An effective strategy will take into account the impact the campaign will have on organi- zational resources, strength, and morale. Strategies that work maximize the use of th ose resources—volunteers, money, equipment, facilities— and help secure additional re- sources where needed. 4. Campaign targets. Every campaign has a target—an entity that has the power to meet th e group's demands or solve the problems it's raised. For most i ssue campaigns this target is either an institution, a corpora tion (or corporate representa- tive), an elected official, a go vernmental agency, or a com- peting activist group. A good strategy not only pinpoints the target of the campaign bu t identifies its strengths and"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"D EVELOPING Y OUR S TRATEGY 21 weaknesses and suggests ho w the organization can exert power over the target. 5. Tactics. These are specific actions undertaken to move the strategy along—the \"buildi ng blocks\" that, positioned on the right foundation, will lead to success. (Tactics that help strengthen the foundation of yo ur organizing campaign are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Chapters 5 through 8 address tactics that pertai n specifically to developing fund-raising, media, lobbying , and electoral strategies.) 6. Time frame. Effective strategies reflect the period of time that is available to accomplish the goals set out in the strat- egy. Unfortunately, unrealistic time constraints often pre- vent activists from taking on a campaign they just don't have enough days, weeks, mont hs or even years to win. It is critical to identify the amount of time you have to wage a campaign and the amount of ti me you need to deploy spe- cific tactics in order to achieve your short- and long-term goals. You can do this by co unting backward from a spe- cific date—a vote in the legi slature, an election, a filing deadline—to the present, then taking stock of your tactical options. (See Chapter 3 for more guidelines on choosing the right tactics.) When setting goals and developi ng other components of your strategic plan, keep in mind that you will frequently be subject to forces beyond your control . . . forces that could adversely affect your entire strategy. For example, your group's decision to orga- nize a city-wide demonstration to protest unfair housing laws could be derailed by an unexpected budge t crunch that forces you to lay off staff and makes it impossible to rent equipment or pay for pub- licity. Strategies—and the activi sts who develop and implement them—must be flexible to avoid be ing stopped in their tracks by unforeseen circumstances. The answers to some other import ant queries also shape strate- gies and, eventually, the tactics selected to implement them: Are you trying to shift the public debat e on your issue to cast your is- sue in a more favorable light? Ca n you take advantage of existing strong support for your agenda to implement your program as you have designed it? Or must you pr epare to compromise with a sug- gestion that's already been put \"o n the table\" in order to get the best deal available given the circumstances?

In a contentious neighborhood comprised of liberal s and conservatives; Democrats, Republicans, and Indepen dents; baby boomers and senior citizens, and a variety of ethnic groups, ev eryone may unite to fight a local toxic waste dump that endangers them all, or to install speed bumps to protect all of their childr en, or to mount a citizens' crime patrol to safeguard all of their homes. The way you position your issue will determine whether many people will join you in your effo rts—or few. It is critical to be truthful in how you present your is sue to the public. Blatant lies serve no useful purpose, and even \"stretching the truth\" will even- tually stretch your credibility with the media, your members, and other audiences. Strive to frame the issue as an important social concern on which public action is imperative. Your campaign will succeed if you reinforce the positive aspects of your issue while reminding audiences of your o pponents\" negatives. If you need help in crystallizing your camp aign theme, budget permitting, focus groups could help. Focus groups offer an excellent research tool for gaining a better understanding of complex attitude s, perceptions, and motivations. The technique is referred to as a \"qualitative\" research approach since it attempts to assess anecdota l information (as opposed to the more rigorously quantita tive methodologies used in opinion surveys). In a focus group, ten participants are engaged in an in-depth dis- cussion that explores a wide ra nge of attitudes and perceptions. Discussions generally last two hou rs, are led by a trained modera- tor, and follow a detail ed discussion guide that is developed in conjunction with the group that has commissioned the research. Participants are offered a cooperation fee ranging from $35 to $125. (The fee depends on the location, socio-economic status of the respondent group, and availab ility of potential participants.) Participants are screen ed during the recruiting process to ensure that they meet the specific char acteristics called for by the re- search. Discussions are usually he ld in a focus group facility equipped with a one-way mirror and an observation room from which clients can view the procee dings, which can be audiotaped, videotaped, or both."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"D EVELOPING Y OUR S TRATEGY 25 One of the main advantages of focus groups over other kinds of opinion research is that they allow the researcher a greater degree of give-and-take with participants, providing the opportunity for follow-up questioning and probing to unearth the reasons behind at- titudes and perceptions. Focus group re search can also be used to get immediate reactions to materials s hown to participants. In a focus group, you can pinpoint specific words and phrases that could be in- corporated into campaign slogans, posters, brochures, and bumper stickers while developing an overall campaign theme. In addition to the participation fee. focus groups often cost at least $5,000 per group. But if the stakes are high, you're uncertain about your message, and you have the mone y, they're probably worth it. WHO DEVELOPS THE STRATEGY? People feel like they \"belong\" to a group when they are allowed to help develop, implement, and re vise strategies for achieving the group's organizational goals and ob jectives. Thus, in any group, both members and leaders should help co nceptualize and implement strat- egy. Because the process involves id entifying and defining issues, it also helps anyone who participates in strategy making to learn to think in long-range terms, see the \"big picture,\" and understand how to maximize whatever resources th e group has at its disposal. Be- sides, involving people in strate gy decisions gives them an invest- ment in its success. Those invo lved in planning and developing a strategy are far more likely to want to help carry it out. To develop your strategy, convene your leaders, staff and volun- teers in a large room stocked with flip charts or blackboards. Using the Strategy Checklist on page 22 as the outline for a blueprint, at- tempt to answer each of the questi ons the checklist raises. Ask for input from the entire group, and take notes on the flip chart for all to see. (You may need to hold more than one session to get through all the questions and come up with a comprehensive blue- print for the campaign.) Using the flip charts as a point of reference, type up the strategy into a document that you can refe r to over and over again as the campaign proceeds, modifying your plans depending on how the campaign evolves. If you feel the need to keep the strategy document confidential, ask those who particip ated in developing the strategy not to discuss it with the media, your opponents, or the public at large. When the campaign is over, review the strategy as you origi-"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"26 L AYING THE F OUNDATION nally conceptualized it. Take note of what worked and what didn't— and apply this knowledge to the next campaign you plan. HOW WILL YOU KNOW IF YOU'VE WON? The answer to this question isn't as obvious as it may seem. Some battles are very clear-cut—you either succeed in blocking a project or passing legislation or you don't. But even when you lose a vote, you may have won a moral victory if you've managed to educate your constituents about th e issue and lay solid groundwork for round two of the campaign. Ev aluate every campaign based on how many of your short- and long -term goals you've achieved, as well as on whether the campaign he lped to augment organizational resources, teach members and volunteers new skills, and educate the public and decision makers about your issue. Notes Jay Sherman, a seasoned grass roots activist who orga- nizes for the Chesapeake Bay Fou ndation: \"The more profound an issue is, the longer it will take to win. Understand the evolution of your success if it is not immediate.\" Converting Rails to Trails: The Strategy Made the Difference During the day, Doug Cheever designs construction equipment at the John Deere Corporation in Dubuque, Iowa. But in his spare time, he helps save abandoned railroad corridors and turns them into recreational trails that thousands of people enjoy. In 1980, Cheever was a fledgling activist who set his sights on saving a twenty-six-mile stretch of railway that was being abandoned by the Chicago and North Western Railroad outside Dubuque. Knowing he needed help, he innocently asked fifteen friends if they would \"spend five hours a week for six months\" to figure out a way to buy the abandoned track and convert it into a recreational trail to be enjoyed by bikers, hikers, and runners."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"D EVELOPING Y OUR S TRATEGY 27 Cheever's cohorts formed Heritage Trail, Inc., devel- oped an \"action plan,\" produced a slide show and began attending public hearings. At one point, Cheever and other rail-trail supporters ev en pledged $12,000 of their own money to make a nonrefundable deposit on the land they were trying to buy. At almost every step of th e way, the activists encoun- tered heavy resistance to their project from neighbors who feared the trail would entice a \"criminal element\" into the region. Wooden railroad trestles and bridges were burned, partly in protest, partly to intimidate the organizers. Doug Cheever developed a winning strategy to convert an abandoned rail- road corridor into a recreational path. But Cheever and his friends pressed on. And seven years after Cheever's six-month promise was long for- gotten, the activists jubilant ly completed the Heritage Trail to give momentum to a rails-to-trails movement in Iowa and Illinois that has reverberated throughout the Midwest. When asked for the secret to his success, Cheever told the Washington, DC-bas ed Rails-to-Trails Conser- vancy, which has helped activists in over five hun- dred communities convert ab andoned railways into rec- reational trails, \"What u ltimately brought us through was having an overall plan—a sequence of events. We knew what it would take to win, even if we were some- what naive about the amount of effort required. \"We organized as if the odds were against us because they were.\""},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"28 L AYING THE F OUNDATION STRATEGY DO'S and DON'Ts • Do set specific short-and long-term goals. • Do identify the resources you need to win. • Do focus on targets who can be swayed by your campaign—and who have the power to solve the problem you're working on. • Do use tactics that will help meet your goals and objectives. • Do give yourself enough time. • Don't expect to win just because you think you're \"right.\" Without a well- conceived strategy, you'll end up wasting time and other resources and maybe never achieve your goals, • Don't overestimate or underestimate the level of effort involved in mounting your campaign. • Don't aim the campaign too broadly.

BASIC TACTICS I F THE STRATEGY is figuring out how to win the race, the tactics are the individual steps you take to get to the finish line. In other words, tactics are the specific activities an organization engages in to achieve its strategi c goals and objectives. Tactics cre- ate the pressure you need in the right place at the right time to win on a particular issue, strengtheni ng your organization in the pro- cess. An effective lactic is one th at impacts a lot of people, unites and involves people, is strongly fe lt, is simple, builds the organi- zation, and is fun. Some tactics defy classification but still are effective because they use creativity and ingenuity to make their point. For example, a North Carolina activist who opposed the construction of a haz- ardous waste disposal complex in his community bought forty- eight acres of the land that was being considered for the complex. He then subdivided his forty-eigh t acres into 70,000 different par- cels and began selling them off at $5 a share. The income from the sales was used to offset the $70,000 the activist had borrowed to pay for the land. In order for the developer to obtain the property, it has to notify each landowner of its intent to condemn the land, 29"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"30    L AYING THE F OUNDATION and negotiate a settlement for the purchase of each plot. If the landowners don't cooperate—and fe w are expected to—the devel- oper may have to sue each one to gain possession of the land, a time-consuming process that coul d cost between $500 and $1,000 per landholder—and effectively terminate the project. There are many simpler but equally creative tactics you can use to advance your campaign strategy. The Mothers of East L.A. re- lied upon several tactics to achiev e their organizing objective—the defeat of the prison. Through thei r marches on the bridge and their bus trips to Sacramento, they generated statewide publicity. By lobbying in the state capitol, they swayed lawmakers' opinions. And by getting their constituents to register to vote—and elected to political office—the Mothers are garnering even more power. As every case study in this book demonstrates, it is extremely rare for an organizing strategy to revolve around just one tactic, particularly when the focus of the strategy is to affect the law. Leg- islators are exceedingly suscepti ble to the tide of public opinion, forcing most activists to wage their campaigns in the media as forcefully as they do in th eir state house or city hall. Yet most groups will not (and cannot afford to) engage in all possible tactics during the course of a campaign; nor will they need to. Instead, the most successful groups selectively choose which tactics will have a real im pact on their opposition. Some options—like private meetings and letter writing—allow you to work quietly behind the scenes when diplomacy is called for and when there's less urgency to ma ke something happen immediately. Use tactics that will help you ge nerate a lot of publicity—like demonstrations, sit-ins, pickets, and press conferences—when you need to focus the spotlight on your target, educate the public at large, and rally significant numbers of people behind your cause. Obviously, when your goal is to pass a new law, defeat a proposed law, or amend an existing law, you'll have to lobby. When you're trying to hold a cor poration accountable for its actions, you may man picket lines, organize a boycott, or launch shareholder actions. And when your only recourse is to take an issue before the courts, you'll have to engage in litigation. Remember one important tactical rule: Let your campaign build. Start out with the easiest tactics first; graduate to more difficult but meaningful activities as your campaign advances and you need to mount greater and greater shows of strength. Don't \"shoot your wad\" organizing a march of five hundred people at the beginning of your campaign when a picket manned by fifty activists will do."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"B ASIC T ACTICS 31 Save the most dramatic and impressive tactics for those times in the campaign when you really have to turn the heat up a few degrees. • • STEP BY STEP• • How to Choose Your Tactics When You Want to...................

Tips for developing and implementing these strategies can be found in Part II. The rest of t h i s chap ter focuses on tactics that are fundamental to any organizing campaign. LETTER WRITING Letters are among the oldest and mo st effective or ganizing tac- tics. In fact, more than two hundr ed years ago, Committees of Cor- respondence during the American Re volution used letters to keep fellow patriots informed and invol ved. Letters can provide infor- mation to someone who matters, bolster support for a position when the person who holds it is un der pressure to change his or her mind, thank people or tell them you agree with them, try to in- fluence the way someone votes, ask for help, tell people you don't agree with them, identify a pr oblem or propose a solution. The National Audubon Society's Armchair Activist Program of- fers a terrific model for any group, local or national, that wants to use letter writing in its arsenal of activist tools. The program is aimed at Audubon chapter member s who are too busy to attend meetings or other activities but who still want to make a differ- ence. Activists who participate in the program's Letter of the Month Club spend no more than a half hour per month writing a letter to a targeted official. Audubon provid es a concise description of the problem, tells activists when to wr ite the letter, provides names and addresses of targeted officials, a nd provides a samp le letter to copy or rewrite. Armchair Activist or ganizer Jeff Lippert estimates that over 3,500 letters are generated th is way each month on federal is- sues alone. The activists are also encouraged to write to their state or local officials. (Be aware that a letter has greater impact if it is original, rather than a copy of the same le tter other activists are submitting.)"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"B ASIC T ACTICS 33 • •STEP BY STEP• • How to Write a Letter • Be neat. If you want to create a personal, nonslick effect, handwrite your letter, but make it very clear and easy to read. Otherwise, use a typewriter or computer. • Get the details right. Include your return address on the let- ter, because envelopes tend to get thrown away. Also, include a telephone number where you can be reached during the day. If you're writing a letter to a newspa per or television station, the editors may want to call you an d personally get your permission to run your letter. • Address the letter properly. \"Dear Editor\" if sending to a newspaper; \"The Honorable . . .\" if sending to a legislator; and \"Mr.\" or \"Ms.\" if writing to anyone else. • Be brief, clear, and to the point. Write in your own words. Don't be intimidated by whomev er you're writing to. If it's an elected official, remember: He or she works for you! • Mention the bill number if you're writing concerning a specific piece of legislation. • Write from the heart. Be personal. • Request a reply. Otherwise, your letter may be ignored. • Time your letter so that it arrives when it will do some good. If it reaches its destination to o early or loo late, it won't get printed or affect the outcom e of the debate. If you're writing your letter as part of a campaign, call the campaign organizer to find out when to write. You can also call the governmental com- mittee (of the state legislature or city council, for example) overseeing the issue to find out when a vote is coming up or when a decision is in the works."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"34    L AYING THE F OUNDATION CHECK IT OUT: For more information about letter writing, contact The Armchair Activist at 1415 Braebum, Flossmoor, IL 60422. BOYCOTTS According to National Boycott News, which reports on boycotts under way around the world, a boycott is \"the withholding of eco- nomic, social or political participa tion as a means of protesting or forcing the alteration of various policies or practices deemed unjust or unfair by the boycotter.\" Boycotts have been practiced in this country since at least 1773, when colonists angered by the policy of taxation without represen- tation dumped tons of British tea into Boston Harbor. But the term \"boycott\" didn't come into use until more than one hundred years later when, in 1880, the Irish Land League called upon the public to ostracize Captain Charles Cunningham Boycott, a scurrilous lowlife who ruthlessly collected re nts for an absentee British land- lord. The term \"boycott\" stuck. Some boycotts single out one consumer product on which to fo- cus their attention: Union organizers in North Carolina have admonished consumers not to \"sl eep with J. P. Stevens'' by avoiding the purchase of the company's bed linens to force the tex- tiles manufacturer to negotiate w ith employees upset over poor working conditions. The United Fa rm Workers still tell shoppers not to buy table grapes to gain safer and more humane working conditions for the primarily migrant fruit pickers, a message they've been disseminating since the late sixties. Other boycotts may be broader. The San Francisco-based Rainforest Action Network has or ganized a boycott of all products produced by the Mitsubishi Corpor ation to pressure the company to suspend logging practices in e ndangered rain forests in Malay- sia, while Earth Island Institute, also based in the Bay Area, has launched a boycott of Taiwanese products to protest that country's traffic in endangered species. One of America's most famous boycotts was started on Decem- ber 1, 1955, when Rosa Parks, an unassuming black woman living"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"B ASIC T ACTICS 35 in segregated Birmingham. Alabam a, refused to move to the back of a bus as local law then requir ed all blacks to do. Her act of courage started a 381-day bus bo ycott in Montgomery that ulti- mately resulted in a Supreme Cour t ruling that outlawed segrega- tion and changed th e face of civil rights in this country forever. Boycotts used to be a tactic that companies airily dismissed and activists launched just as warily. But today, most companies con- sider boycotts and boycotters seri ously. And whereas boycotts used to take five to ten years to make their mark, today many boycotts have an impact in far less time— although you should still be pre- pared to devote months, if not years, to a successful boycott cam- paign. Boycott organizers have learned thr ee things: first, to succeed, it helps to get the message to as ma ny people as quickly as possible; second, it is important to aim th e boycott at the company's image, as well as at the offending product; and third, it is critical to set a clear and tangible goal so that you know when to declare victory and get out. Boycotts work by cutting profits or demonstrating the potential for cutting profits by changing co nsumer purchasing habits. Boy- cotts also are effective in genera ting media coverage that could in- fluence purchasing decisions, a nd in creating negative public relations for the company or product that is the target of the boy- cott. In the past, groups that organiz ed boycotts would rely on press releases, press conferences, and constituency newsletters and publications to help spread t he word and mobilize consumers. Better-financed boycotts have begun using di rect mail, involving"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"36 L AYING THE F OUNDATION celebrities, taking out full-page ads in popular newspapers and magazines, and producing videot apes documenting their cases against the companies. Some gr oups stage dramatic, mediagenic actions. For example, Mitsubishi boycotters have handcuffed them- selves to the company's cars while t hey're on the assembly line. In the boycott against General Electric , organized to protest the com- pany's substantial role as a nucl ear weapons manufacturer, activists went beyond consumers to convi nce many hospita l administrators to boycott G.E.'s hospit al equipment and to persuade shop owners to carry light bulbs manufactured by firms other than G.E. In 1991, five years into its boycott campai gn, the INFACT/Boycott G.E. or- ganization got a big boost when its twenty-eight-minute film. Deadly Deception: General Elect ric, Nuclear Weapons and Our Environment, won an Academy Award for its portrayal of the mega-company as \"Ameri ca's #1 Polluter.\" Millions of consumers worldwide wrote letters, made p hone calls, and signed petitions; eventually G.E. sold its aeros pace division, whic h housed its nu- clear weapons operation. (David Warshaw, manager of corporate communications at General Electr ic, claimed: \"The decision to transfer our aerospace businesses to Martin Marietta was due to the status of the defense industry, wh ich is undergoing consolidations as a result of government decisi ons to reduce defense spending.\" He would not comment on whether G.E. felt an economic impact from the boycott.) Where Do You Start? Before you launch a boycott, conduct a care ful analysis of the product or company you' re targeting and your ability to affect the company's profits. First, make sure you're right about the damage the product or company is doing. Re member that a product that ev- eryone buys frequently, is easily identifiable by brand name, is nonessential, or—what' s even better—for whi ch there are compet- ing brands or substitutes is much ea sier to boycott than one most people don't buy or use anyway. Bo ycotts against local retail busi- nesses are more manageable than ar e boycotts of products made by some multinational corpor ation based far away. Don't lose sight of the fact that the most effective boycotts raise a significant moral issue. To get p eople to particip ate in a boycott, you've got to make them angry a bout the injustice, then motivate them to wield their power as consumers to bring about change."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"B ASIC T ACTICS 37 • • STEP BY STEP • • How to Organize a Boycott • Pick your target carefully. Is the offender the industry leader? The biggest offender in the industry? The company most sympathetic to your demands, and thus the one most likely to meet your demands and set an example? The company with the highest visibility or the products that are most easily recognized by consumers? The one that is most economically unstable or has the most vulnerable image? Most boycotters base their de- cision upon a combination of these criteria. • Write to the targeted company about your issue. Begin with a letter from your orga nization expressing yo ur concerns. Depend- ing on the company's response, you' ll probably have to write an- other letter stating why the comp any's reply is insufficient and requesting that your interests rece ive more serious consideration. • Attempt to work with a p erson from the company di- rectly involved in the issue. Try to define precisely the points of disagreement. Ask the company to develop a proposal that addresses your concerns, or devi se your own proposal for how the company might address the points of disagreement. • Set deadlines. If, by chance, the company agrees to your proposal, don't let it stall. Crea te a time line for how these points will be dealt with. If the company refuses to accept your proposal or time line, advise the company that if action is not taken by a certain date, you will consider a boycott against it. If the company fails to meet the deadline, inform it that you are researching the possibility of launching a boycott against it, but are willing to keep the lines of communication open. Include a list of your demands. If you hear nothing new from the com- pany, notify it that you will ho ld a press conference announcing the boycott on a particular date. Reiterate that you are willing to keep the lines of communication open. Tell the company what a positive step it would be if it were to meet your demands. • Before announcing the boycott, outline your long- and short-term goals. Decide how you will measure the boycott's effectiveness.

Ask other group s to co-sponsor or endorse the boycott. Define the process to be used to reach any settlement of the boycott. Be prepared to take advantage of the visibility generated immediately after calling the boycott. • Ask co-sponsors and endorsers of the boycott to send let- ters to the company expressing their support for the future boycott action. • Send updated lists of the e ndorsements and co-sponsors to the company and to the media. • Organize a rally and press conference to formally kick off the boycott. Efforts should include simultaneous press con- ferences and rallies in other cities where the boycott is being or- ganized. The primary press conference should be held where the company maintains its headquarters—where its local image is highly important. Be upbeat, clever, colorful, and even humor- ous if possible. • When the company meets your demands, call off the boy- cott! INFACT announced the April 2, 1993, end to the G.E. boycott by writing and distributing a press release, phoning local and national outlets, mailing a vict ory letter to its now-huge activ- ist network, and, of course, notifyi ng G.E. in writing that the boy- cott was over. Depending on the visibility and timeliness of the boycott, a press conference is also an effective way to let consum- ers know, not just that you won, but that you are keeping your promise and taking pressure off the company. \"It's really easy to add more and more to the demand s as a company responds,\" said Kelle Louaillier of INFACT/Boycott G.E.. \"but in fairness to the movement you need to respect those demands and move on.\" • Constantly evaluate the co mpany's response and whether it is worthwhile to continue your campaign. Don't be too proud to call off a boycott that is making no progress and thus is losing credibility. You usually can end a campaign quietly without too much hoopla. Redirect that energy to another tactic that mav work better for you. (Adapted from Tips for Calling a Boycott,\" National Boycott News.

Who'd ever think a bunch of kids could bring a mega- corporation to its knees? Certainly not the McDonald's fast-food chain. But it didn't take McDonald's long to figure out it was wrong. In 1990 groups of New Jersey elementary and high school students had beco me increasingly concerned with the environmental impact of the company's nonbiode- gradable plastic foam packaging. The groups, Kids Against Pollution, from Tenakill Elementary School, and the Environmental Club of West Milford High School, feared that the gases used to produce the company's plas- tic foam packaging were da maging the Earth's protective ozone layer. The students weren't too wild about the amount of garbage McDonald's was creating, either. At the time, McDonald's was the nation's largest user of"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" L AYING THE F OUNDATION polystyrene food packaging, producing enough \"styro- trash\" each day to f i l l a fo otball stadium forty feet deep. The kids asked McDonald's to stop using foam pack- aging and to switch to pape r or reusable products. They gave the company six months to consider their requests, asking for a response by Earth Day 1990. When McDonald's failed to reply, the two groups is- sued a call for an interna tional boycott and began pick- eting McDonald's restaurants in their area. The art department at the high school printed \" BOYCOTT MCDONALD ' S \" bumper stickers that were mailed to con- cerned youths across the country. Kurtiz Schneid, a senior at West Milford High School and president of the Environmental Club, attracted enor- mous attention at demonstra tions by dressing as a clown named \"Ronald McToxic.\" In fact, when Schneid was in- vited to speak before the Un ited Nations General Assem- bly as part of the UN's 1990 Environmental Education Day, he used the occasion to issue an appeal to the world to boycott McDonald's dresse d in full \"McToxic\" attire. Borrowing from a well-known McDonald's jingle, the clown concluded: \"The planet deserves a break today.\" Meanwhile, another grass ro ots group. Vermonters Or- ganized for Clean-up (VOC) had been urging friends and neighbors to stop buying Bi g Macs—and all foam pack- aging—since 1987. For their ban of Styrofoam (foamed polystyrene). Vermont boycotters had also chosen McDon- ald's as a target, and capitaliz ed on holidays by organizing rallies at local McDonald's out lets. The slogan for yearly April Fool's Day activities wa s \"You Can't McFool Us!\" On Valentine's Day, huge hear ts were constructed reading \"Dear Earth.

VOC saw the national poten tial for the boycott and contacted the Citizen's Cleari nghouse for Hazardous Wastes (CCHW), which plugged the b oycott into its grass roots network of activists around t he country concerned about the manufacture and disposal of toxic substances. \"It became a people's campaign,\" said Theresa Freeman of VOC.

Thos e people were \"hardworking, everyday people scattered th roughout the country,\" she said. \"We looked for a camp aign that was nationwide— people taking action on their local McDonald's and ty- ing it to their local problem.\" According to Newman, as groups took on McDon- ald's in their communities, th ey tailored their protest to their own circumstances. Groups concerned about shrinking landfill space talked in terms of McDonald's' contribution to the garbage crisis. Organizations fighting incinerators argued that burning packaging material like the McDonald's clamshells would release toxic gases into the atmosphere. Groups tailored their tactics to their own resources as well. In addition to the boyco tt, some groups raucously picketed their local McDonald's; others tied up order lines demanding alte rnative packaging. In November 1990, McDona ld's announced an end to its use of plastic foam p ackaging and a switch to a paper-based wrap. On the day McDonald's an nounced its new policy, the Environmental Defense Fund , with whom the company worked closely to develop new ways to reduce the amount of garbage created at its 8,500 restaurants, noted that the \"end of the polystyrene clamshell represents the turning of the tide on the throwaway society.\" (Today, the company reports that the p ackaging switch has reduced the volume of its sandwich container waste by 90 percent. The switch has also prompted other fast-food chains to adopt more environmentally friendly practices.) In the end, the campaign to get McDonald's to stop using Styrofoam was won, sa id Newman, \"in our towns, by our own people, involving more and more people from all walks of life.\" (Excerpted from \"McVictory: Kids Mount Successful McBoycott,\" National Boycott News.

These suits are largely intended to intimidate the activists and drive them to drop their campaign. Dubbed SLAPP suits—for Strategic Law- suit Against Political Participation—these actions usually fail to re- cover damages. Todd Putnam of National Boycott News said that of the hundreds of boycotts the publication has tracked, he knows of only three SLAPP suits that have been carried to closure. Still, suits prey upon activists' fear s and pocketbooks, since hiring a lawyer, even as a precau tion, can get expensive. Sometimes SLAPP suits can backfire, even for powerful corpo- rations.

PUBLIC HEARINGS A public hearing is a forum that allows both sides of a contro- versy to air their concerns and r aise questions about an issue on the public agenda. Though intended to be a civilized debate, it may turn into a downright brouhaha if tempers flair and passions rise. In general, public hearings are organized by public officials— for example, representatives of the federal government, city or county administrators or counci l members, school board members, PTA officials—in order to receive varying viewpoints on conten- tious topics. The hearing may be held because a vote on a city or town ordinance is approaching, or because an agency is consider- ing taking an action that affects many people in different and sig- nificant ways. Though votes fa voring or opposing the proposal being debated are rarely taken at a public hearing, the event may serve as an important barometer of public opinion that influences the vote when it eventually oc curs. If you know going into the hearing whether the event is perfunc tory, or whether the issue will in fact be determined largely by wh at transpires at the hearing, you can develop your strategy accordingly. Because public hearings can be so volatile, they are usually scheduled at a neutral location, su ch as a school or city hall. The convener of the hearing may aler t the public by putting a notice containing the hearing date, time, a nd location in the local paper or by posting announcements on the local cable television channel and on fliers at city hall, ofte n publishing the meeting's agenda as an invitation for all residents to attend. (The federal government posts notices of the hearings it holds in the Federal Register.) Some agencies will mail notices of impending hearings to lists of citizens who have requested that th ey be kept informed. Activists who worry they might somehow miss the hearing are free to con- tact the city council or agency themselves to find out when the"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"44 L AYING THE F OUNDATION hearing will be held, then publici ze the meeting to their members or other volunteers by posting flye rs, running their own advertise- ments, and activating their teleph one trees (for a description of telephone trees, see page 51). Public hearings provide activists with an impo rtant opportunity to demonstrate their own strength on the position th ey've taken and give those convening the hearing a sense of how concerned people are about the issue. Hearings also let activists observe their oppo- nents \"up close and personal\" an d get a sense of the arguments they can expect to be made again st them during the campaign. Fi- nally, through their testimony at the hearing (and the written com- ments usually submitted afterward) , activists can place additional facts and comments about thei r position on public record. Local hell-raisers frequendy use publ ic hearings to generate favor- able media coverage abou t their position and to establish credibility for their organization in the pub lic eye (Chapter 6, \"Communica- tions,\" offers many more tips for using the media effectively). For example, community activists in Lo rton, Virginia, who were opposed to the poorly planned siting of an incinerator in their community, at- tended a public hearing wearing surg ical masks to demonstrate their concerns for the negative air quality impact the incinerator would have on the region. The next day's newspaper carried a small story about the hearing but a large photo of the activists bedecked in their white surgical masks. When Lois Gibbs, catal yst of the now-famous victory over the Hooker Chemical Company in Love Canal, New York, saw that officials were not lis tening to her testimony at a pub- lic hearing in Maryland, she stoppe d speaking and stood silently at the microphone. Eventually, the officials noticed and asked if she was finished. \"No, sir,\" she said. \"I was simply waiting for you to start listening. When you're ready, I'll continue.\"* Potential speakers at a public hearing often have to sign up at the beginning of the meeting; the first five, for example, from the \"pro\" side as well as from the \"c on\" side may be given time at the podium. Sometimes interested sp eakers can call the sponsoring council member's office in advance and sign up there. Either way, slots should be set aside for an equal number of s peakers on each side of the issue. Some hearings limit the time per speaker and the time allotted for the entire proceedin g; some offer a chance for au- dience or council members to res pond to or question speakers. * As reported in How to Win in Public Hearings.

You prob- ably won't have a chance to address every issue you'd like. So strategize with others in your organization or coalition and divvy up the topics that need to be addressed among several speakers. That way all of your issues get aired. • Even though your oral remarks may be brief, you can submit lengthy supporting documents to the entity conven- ing the hearing for the public record. You can also distribute news releases, fact sheets, and charts at the hearing to help ed- ucate the public and the medi a along with those holding the hearing. • During the hearing, make notes of what others say on the issues you feel need clarification or rebuttal. You can re- spond either during your statemen t or in written comments you submit after the hearing. • Make your group's presence at the hearing felt with signs, posters, and other visual effects. These will not only help pressure the officials who have convened the hearing, but will increase your chances of securing media coverage. • Be polite. Emotions tend to escalate at public hearings as charges fly and people begin to vent their anger and frustration. Try to keep your feelings in check , even as you hear accusations or assertions you believe to be untrue. You will have your chance to respond either at the podium or in writing; by doing so in a controlled, mature manner, you will earn the respect of those who are making the decisions and will not be portrayed as unreasonable or out of control by the media."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"46    L AYING THE F OUNDATION CHECK IT OUT: How to Win in Public Hearings. published by the Citizen's Clearinghouse for Hazardous Wastes, Inc..

LITIGATION Litigation—filing lawsuits and go ing to court—is a way to en- force existing laws and to protect the rights that are inherent in them. According to the League of Women Voters (LWV), litigation is \"both a practical method for effecting change and a powerful means of working within the system for the best interests of the public.\" Filing lawsuits can be extremely time-consuming and expensive, so it's not a tactic you want to employ on a regular basis. There will be occasions, however, when your adversary leaves you no choice but to use the law to for ce a specific action, delay a deci- sion, punish wrongdoers, or give your group the leverage it needs to win compensation for people w ho have suffered personal inju- ries or whose property has been damaged. LWV writes that public officials sometimes take groups that have brought suit more seri- ously in future negotiations, and often the mere announcement of plans to sue can cause officials to change course. How do you know when a lawsuit is the right plan of action? In its publication Contemplating a Lawsuit, the Northern Rockies Action Group (NRAG) has compiled a list of questions organiza- tions should ask themselves when considering legal action. 1 . Does the lawsuit aim at an activity that is squarely within the established purp oses of the organization? The cause for the suit should be very near to the group's core is- sue or issues. A suit is not a good means for broadening a group's horizons. 2. Will the suit be a diversion and a drain? \"A lawsuit is a"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"B ASK T ACTICS 47 luxury,\" NRAG author Scott W. Reed writes. If it doesn't further one or more of the goals of the group, choose an- other tactic. 3. Is the suit likely to boost membership or at least not alienate present members? In other words, will the law- suit maintain the organization's current health and foster, rather than hamper, future growth? 4. Are there alternatives to litigation that might achieve comparable or better results? Don't forget about the ef- fect political pressure—lev eraged through letters, phone calls, lobbying, public hearings , boycotts, media coverage, and other tactics—can have on a public official, govern- mental agency, or corporation. 5. Can you afford a lawyer? Check your resources and com- mitment to a potential suit before taking on the expense that accompanies legal counsel. 6. Have you been sued? Do you need to defend yourself against a lawsuit that has been filed against you or your or- ganization? Lawyers may be extremely useful in helping you unearth important information about your opponent in the event you are sued. In a process known as \"discovery,\" both you and your opponent will have to respond to written questions (interrogatories); make sworn, pretrial oral state- ments in response to verbal que stions (depositions); and file certain motions such as \"mot ions to produce\" documents, records, or files, or \"motions to inspect\" buildings or facil- ities. Your lawyer will also represent you before the judge in the case, and argue your case before a jury if necessary. While you can read the laws and regulations applicable to your business, a lawyer may be able to help you find ways to avoid le- gal pitfalls, intercede with the government, and represent you in the event you are sued. A lawyer can also help you review the de- tails of any agreements or contr acts you enter into, read proposed legislation to determine if the la nguage a bill contains is constitu- tional or reflects your intent, and help you determine when to sue others. The following example highlig hts one situation in which hell- raisers had no option other than litigation to change a company's discriminatory business practices."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"48    L AYING THE F OUNDATION Suing to Shatter the \"Glass Ceiling\" In any workplace, individual cases of discriminatory hiring and firing are pretty disturbing. But when an en- lire group of employees finds itself victimized, a chill- ing sense of alarm can begin to infect everyone. Frequently, the most successful—and sometimes the only—way to fight job discrimination is in court. In the 1970s, Muriel Kraszewski, Wilda Tipton, and Daisy Jackson worked as administrative assistants and office managers in various State Farm Insurance Com- pany agencies in California. Each was interested in be- coming a sales agent trainee. Yet every time they asked their agency managers about the possibility of advance- ment, they were told that they could not possibly be considered. The reasons the management gave were weak and kept changing: The women did not have col- lege degrees; they didn't have enough sales experience; the company did not encourage transfers from opera- tions to sales divisions. Fo r each excuse they encoun- tered, however, all three employees could think of several male State Farm agents who lacked the very qualifications that were supposedly barring the women from sales. The women were highly efficient workers who juggled heavy loads of responsibilities, including discussing complicated policies and premiums with cli- ents over the phone; why couldn't they, too, advance? When Muriel and Daisy quickly found successful po- sitions as sales agents with one of State Farm's compet- itors, it became clear that not only were they qualified to sell insurance but that State Farm was actively dis- criminating against women. The three women contacted Guy Saperstein. an Oak- land attorney known for class action suits and a member of Trial Lawyers for Public Justice. Together they filed suit against State Farm for se x discrimination in its hir- ing and promotion policies. Then Saperstein embarked on a complicated, twofold mission: to review the com-"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"B ASIC T ACTICS 49 party's recruiting and personnel materials, which he be- lieved would prove the compa ny's bias against recruit- ing women; and to locate the hundreds of plaintiffs who had experiences similar to the plaintiffs'. By acting on behalf of more women, he not only could win them their deserved compensation but also could build a stronger class action suit against State Farm. State Farm dug in its heels, claiming that it did not keep information on job appl icants who took aptitude tests, which would have provided the plaintiffs with a crucial body of evidence. But even without the proof, when the trial began in 1982, the lawyer painted a pic- ture of blatant sex discrimination by State Farm's ag- ency managers. Many witnesses backed up the three women's assertions, recounting statements that had sent the subtle but unmistakable me ssage to women that they need not apply for promotions, Saperstein continued to build his case against State Farm, showing that the company recruited mainly within social circles and among personal contacts. None of its recruitment literature pictured or even mentioned women. And then a bombshell hit: Slipping up, one wit- ness, a State Farm research employee, referred to the number of women who had ta ken the company's apti- tude test and to the data base from which he got the number. Here was the critical evidence Saperstein had been looking for all along, and the company had bla- tantly withheld it! The judge was as enraged as Saperstein, and ordered State Farm to produce the rec- ords immediately. Besides slapping State Farm with $430,000 worth of sanctions for withholding discoverable evidence, the judge wrote a 175-page opinion finding State Farm lia- ble for intentional sex discrimination in its recruitment, selection, and hiring of sales agent trainees. But Saperstein's work was far from done. He de- manded individual trials for each woman who had been discriminated against. State Farm agreed to help track down these women, who numbered an estimated 60.000 to 70,000.

Hire a \"hometown\" lawyer if po ssible, preferably someone in your community who cares about th e issues your group is working on and may even be a member. Inte rview several candidates in an effort to find an experienced lawy er who has carried suits similar to the one you're contemplating. Get references from other organi- zations you trust. And check with your local bar association to de- termine whether any complaints have been filed against the attorney you're considering hiring. When you do hire a lawyer, draw up a clear contract detailing what the lawyer is expected to do and by when. You should remain in control of key decisions, but use your lawyer for advice. Don't let your lawyer decide your orga nizing strategy; most lawyers are not experts on organizing, and they may shy away from tactics you need to engage in for organizing purposes. Everybody knows that le gal services are not cheap. Still, you may be able to find a lawyer or a group of lawyers willing to take your case on a pro bono (\"for the public good\") basis, which would allow you to get their servic es for free and pay only their expenses. Most lawyers charge either on a simple fee basis or on a contin- gency fee basis. A simple fee basi s, charged by the hour, may be expensive but also gives you more control over how and when le- gal bills are incurred. A contingency fee will be paid only when and if the lawyer wins your case in court. But the disadvantage of this approach is that it may encourage your lawyer to settle too quickly and under conditions that you find unsatisfact ory just so the attorney can get paid.

ORGANIZING TELEPHONE TREES AND COMPUTER NETWORKS In the heat of a campaign, you may need to ask many members of your group to participate in a de monstration, write letters, send telegrams, or take other important \"last-minute\" actions. The fastest way to mobilize people may be by calling them on the telephone. In smaller organizations, telepho ne \"trees\" work by circulating a list of names and phone numbers to all members and asking each person to call the next name on the list. If someone can't be reached, the caller skips to the ne xt person who can be contacted.

You may not like talking to your \"enemies\" much, but there are times when it makes sense to negotiate with them. Why? Perhaps you've directed successful actions against them but you still don't have written guarantees to secure their commitments; negotiations will formalize or solidify on paper the gains you've made through more direct action. You may want to negotiate if doing so will strengthen your position vis-a-vis your opponent. You may also agree to negotiate in order to ga in information about your target that you can't get any other way. On the other hand, do not negotiate when you suspect your ne- gotiating team can be outmaneuvered, or if you must cease direct action while the negotiations ar e under way. And certainly don't negotiate a bargain that benefits i ndividuals within the organization over the membership at large. • • STEP BY STEP • • How to Negotiate • Appoint a negotiating team for your group. Give those representing you explicit instructions about how far they can go in the session and what kinds of issues must be brought back for a group decision. • Do not surrender your power. Don't give up the right to picket, sue, organize, or do whatev er else is needed just because a company is willing to talk with you. • Plan your strategy carefully. Decide who from your group will chair the meeting, what will be said and not be said during the session. Be clear about what kinds of disclosures you want to make and avoid. Don't disclose your \"bottom line\" or reveal any hidden weaknesses in your group's power or strategy. • Be prepared for give-and-take. Set initial demands high enough to give you room to compromise on some points. Be"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"B ASIC T ACTICS 55 How to Negotiote (cont.) clear about your most essential interests, as well as the differ- ence between your interests and your negotiating posture. • Agree on an overall timetable. Establish a specific schedule with dates and times and a bargaining location most advanta- geous to your organization. • Be sure you're talking to the right people. Verify that the people sent to negotiate with you have the authority to make the decisions needed. • Caucus during and between negotiating sessions. If any member of your team is unsure about what to say during a ses- sion, take a break out of earshot from the company officials and other outsiders and consider your strategy. Don't hesitate to walk out of the session if the ot her side is being uncooperative. Between negotiating sessions, get together with other members of your group and discuss strategy, progress, and issues raised in your discussion. • Get agreements in writing. Look for loopholes that could enable those with whom you're negotiating to renege on their commitments. • Determine in advance what you want the outcome to be. Without realistic expectations, yo u won't know where to start negotiating, you'll have trouble figuring out what steps to take along the way, and you w on't know where to stop. Remember the words of James Freund, author of Smart Negoti- ating: How to Make Good Deals in the Real World (Simon and Schuster, 1992): \"It's winning h i m over that counts; not winning over him.\" Freund compares negot iations to sports : You need to approach each negotiation with a well-conceived game plan the same way a football team prepares for each week's contest. But, he warns, you can't follow the plan blindly: y ou must remain alert to unexpected revelations, new developm ents, emerging risks, and opportunities.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires \"public-issue\" corporations—those registered with the SEC—to disclose lawsuits or agency proceed- ings that might require significant spending to represent or defend the corporation. (For example, en vironmental proceedings must be reported if it's obvious that the ty pical investor would want to know about them, or if the resulti ng costs could add up to more than 10 percent of the firm's asse ts, or more than $100,000 if the government became a party to the case.) The SEC also allows shareholders to vote on social a nd political questions relevant to the corporation. Any holder of vo ting stock can pose questions for all shareholders to vote on. Thus, activists can use shareholder meetings to raise issues and place pressure on corporate officials to change the company's policies. What Can You Do? • Become a shareholder. Buy shares of stock in a company whose policies you want to change. • Formulate a proposal for action by shareholders. Recom- mend action by the firm's management or suggest amend- ment of the corporate byla ws. Address your proposal to overall company policy rather than day-to-day decisions. The SEC has particular guidelin es that will help you prepare your proposal; contact them at 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Wash- ington, DC 20549. • Begin a divestment campaign.

ACCOUNTABILITY SESSIONS Accountability sessions are meetings you hold with targeted of- ficials to gain their support for a specific project or proposal and to remind them about the promises they've made in the past. They offer a way to make public offi cials responsible for their votes, policies, written and verbal statem ents, and other actions by letting them experience the displeasure or concern of their constituents firsthand and warning them that th ey will be held accountable for their actions through some kind of reprisal. Those reprisals may take several forms, depending on who the target of the accountabil- ity session is. Withholding vole s, boycotting products, organizing pickets and sit-ins, and generati ng negative publicity are among the tactics groups use to hold officials accountable. Accountability sessions are usually held toward the end of an is- sue campaign after you've built up a great deal of strength, when your group has the ability to turn out hundreds of people, and when your leaders can run an eff ective meeting that really puts heat on the target. Invite the target of the session to attend in a polite letter in which you propose as many dates for a meeting as possible so your target can't refuse. Follow up with a phone call to the target's of-"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"B ASIC T ACTICS 63 fice. If the target refuses to meet with you, publicize the situation through the media, putting the target under more pressure to com- ply with your request. Choose the \"right\" people to speak : In addition to a panel of people who can most powerfully represent your position, include other elected officials who suppor t you (and who want visibil- ity), and general community members. Limit the session to two hours. During the session, make specific demands on the target. These demands could include such actions as passing legislation, funding a specific program, enforcing regulations, or providing community services. Whatever they are, they should be demands you can win: You should go into the session with a substantive list of at least three main demands, as well as a fallback position that still helps you achieve your goals. After a substantial amount of discussion between the audience (your members) and the \"guest speak er\" (the target of the session), ask the target to agree to your de mands—or at least to your fall- back compromise. If you get agr eement, ask for a time frame in which you can expect action to occur. Decide in advance what steps you will take if no agreement is reached. Before holding an accountability session, analyze your target to determine how susceptible he or she is to pressure from your group. Are your members likely to vote for or against this official? The more you represent the politician's constituency, the more clout you'll have. A novice politician who barely won the last election, has a tough time raising campaign money, and is already being pursued by potential oppo nents for the next election may feel compelled to make more co ncessions to your group—for the purposes of getting your votes—t han a seasoned pol who doesn't need your support to win reelection or swell his campaign war chest. For example, legislators who accept large campaign contribu- tions from the National Rifle Association—and who by and large are elected by opponents of gun cont rol—aren't going to be dis- tressed if gun control advocates try to hold them accountable for pro-handgun votes. On the other hand, candidates who are elected by gun-control advocates have more to fear if they oppose legisla- tion to restrict weapons access.

Thoug h you can't \"punish\" these tar- gets by switching votes, you can use other tactics that can con- vince the target to take you se riously. Urging the public to buy products from a competing company or staging protest demonstra- tions outside the official's office or the company's headquarters are just two of the accountability tactics at your disposal. Here's just one example of how local activists incorporated ac- countability sessions into their organizing strategy. SWOP Residents of the Sawmill neighborhood in Albuquerque, New Mexico, complained frequently about the sawdust falling on their homes from a nearby particle board fac- tory and the odd taste of th eir well water, but to no avail. Then the Southwest Organizing Project (SWOP),* a community-based nonprofit group formed in 1980 to work with Chicanos, Native Americans, and African Americans, intervened. SWOP helped organize neighbors in the area into the Sawmill Advisory Council, then held an accountability session at which more than two hundred residents con- fronted local elected officials and agency administrators about the air and water quality problems they were ex- periencing. Organizers asked the state legislature to in- tervene, circulated petitions, contacted the media, and saw to it that the New Mexico Environmental Improve- ment Division tested the air and the water, which was found to be contaminated with formaldehyde, nitrates, toluene, and other toxins. After a six-year fight, state officials finally demanded that the mill comply with hazardous waste management *A more complete desc ription of SWOP's organizing efforts can be found in Our Earth.

Said Richard Moore, SWOP 's co-founder and execu- tive director, \"There had b een numerous complaints for years, but until t h i s commun ity organized, nothing was done.\" PETITIONS A petition is a document that out lines your position on an issue and on which you accumulate the si gnatures of people who agree with your views. A petition is a useful organizing t ool on a number of levels. It provides a way to demonstrate the strength of your group by offer- ing concrete proof that a substan tial number of peop le (at least, those whose names appear on your petition) concur with you and support the action you are propo sing. A petition drive may gener- ate positive publicity that you can use to pressu re the target of your petition while educating the public about the focus of the petition. Asking people to sign a petition may even help you raise money; generous donors may be willing to make a large contribution to support the petition drive itself, a nd those who sign the petition are frequently willing to contribute a fe w dollars along with their sig- nature. The petition can be printed on eith er 8 1/2-by-11 or 8 1/2-by-14- inch paper. It usually has a title , and clearly identifies the group circulating the petition and the perso n intended to receive the pe- tition. A statement at the top of the pe tition describes the reason you're circulating the document in the firs t place: Is there a construction project you oppose, a new anticrim e bill you support, a candidate whose name you're trying to get on the ballot?

Pennsylvania, kn own for its winning Amer- ican Legion baseball teams, hosted visiting opponents in a shiny new $600,000 stad ium. But on rainy days, residents of the little town had to settle for TV: the Pennsylvania Dutc h community didn't have a library! In 1986. a group of book-dep rived residents, includ- ing representatives from th e Berks County Public Li- brary System, local teachers and school librarians, the superintendent of schools and his wife, and the local Girl Scout troop, coalesced into the Boyer town Commu- nity Library Committee. Was there any way to generate public support for a lib rary, they wondered? One scout. Becky Brown, took on the role of project chairman for the Girl Scouts troop, which volunteered to whet readers' interests by setting up a \"washbasket library.\" They collected ol d books from their friends and neighbors and lugged them in washbaskets to barber- shops, beauty parlors, and Laundromats around town.

When town officials saw th at fully hall the commu- nity desired a local library enough to stop and sign their name or mail in the coupon, they eventually approved and helped fund the library. The little building opened in 1988 amid great cele- bration. Today state and lo cal funds fuel its modest monetary needs. For example, officials in Colebrook- dale Township contribute $500 a year as a result of the petition drive orchestrated by the committee. The effort seems to be worth it: The Boyertown Community Li- brary now proudly claims the distinction of being the third most used library (per capita) in the county. NONVIOLENT ACTION Throughout history, people have been effecting change through nonviolent direct action—peaceful demonstrations that protest ob- jectionable laws and institutions. Some activist groups organize an occasional nonviolent action such as a boycott or sit-in as part of a larger political or public relati ons campaign. But many activists adopt nonviolence as a philosophy by which to live. Martin Luther King, Jr., considered nonviolence th e only social change tool that was both socially effective and morally acceptable, writing in 1958 that it is \"one of the most poten t weapons available to oppressed people in their quest for social justice\" (Stride Toward Freedom, Harper and Row). Nonviolent activis ts resist with love instead of hate and answer even violence w ith peaceful activity. Their will- ingness to take personal risk wit hout threatening others makes the tactic a powerful one. A well-known form of nonviolen ce is civil disobedience, wherein activists consciously break a law or oppose a policy they regard as unjust. By this means they raise awareness and spotlight"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"B ASIC T ACTICS 71 their dissatisfaction, ideally to induce lawmakers to change the law or policy they oppose. Civil disobedients may also violate a law that is integral to a system or in stitution they protes t—such as tres- passing on the grounds of a nuclear plant to protest that plant's manufacture of weapons. Henry David Thoreau, one of the first to discuss civil disobedi- ence in his writings in 1849. was jailed for refusing to pay his poll tax—his way of protesting the government for supporting slavery and warring against Me xico. In the 1920s an d 1930s in India and earlier in South Africa, Mohandas Gandhi engaged in both individ- ual and mass acts of civil disobedience to protest oppressive Brit- ish rule and to win independence for India. Rosa Parks committed civil disobedience when she sat in the front of a bus, then legally reserved for whites, in 1955 in Montgomery, Alabama. Today, cit- izen activists turn to civil diso bedience to protest war. abortion rights, and environmental injustice; to support civil, voting, and la- bor rights; and to counter dict atorial governme nts around the world. King identified three important cha racteristics of nonviolent ac- tion: 1. It does not seek to defeat th e opponent but to win his or her friendship and understanding. 2. It is directed against the obj ectionable policy itself rather than the people en acting the policy. 3. It involves a willingness to su ffer. Gandhi found that when opponents won't listen to reas on, suffering is a powerful tool that opens their eyes and ears. Nonviolence is not fo r cowards. When activ ists engage in civil disobedience by knowingly breaking the law. arrest must be an acceptable consequence. The tactic's goal is an assertive one: to ensure that law- and policy-maki ng remain fluid and adapt to changing public opinion. According to Gene Sharp, a lead ing figure in nonviolence the- ory and founder of The Albert Ei nstein Institution, a nonprofit or- ganization advancing the study a nd use of strategic nonviolence, nonviolent action can take three forms: Nonviolent intervention, in which activists chall enge an opponent direct ly, can be the most dangerous and likely to result in arrest and therefore requires the most discipline among pa rticipants.

Civil disobedi- ence most often falls under this heading. Strikes, boycotts, and political noncooperation are categorized as nonviolent noncooper- ation. Nonviolent protests, such as marches, picketing, leafletting, vigils, and public meetings, are la rgely symbolic activities whose goal is not to break the law (a lthough they may involve tres- passing) but to build public aw areness and show your opponent that you are serious. Why Demonstrate Peacefully? Why choose this \"peacenik\" tact ic and philosophy in a world where violence seems to be the ru le rather than the exception? King explained that \"We adopt the means of nonviolence because our end is a community at peace with itself.\" Most people find violence detrimental to their cause as well as morally reprehen- sible. In his essay \"On Civil Disobedi ence\" Thoreau maintained that people have the right to question and resist government when its \"tyranny or inefficiency are gr eat and unendurable.\" He personally could not consider himself ruled by the same governing body that allowed slavery. His reasoning was simple and sensible: If a law is so unjust that it \"requires you to be the agent of injustice to an- other, then, I say, break the law.\" Dr. William Coffin, a debater in the book Civil Disobedience: Aid or Hindrance to Justice? (American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, 1972). held that one should engage in civil disobedience only as a last re sort—\"having written your con- gressmen, having visited senato rs time and time again\" with no results. Nonviolence Training Groups planning to engage in nonviolent action benefit from some form of nonviolence training. According to the War Resisters League's Handbook for Nonviolent Action, training helps partici- pants understand nonviolence both as a historic and enduring phi- losophy and to prepare for partic ular actions. Activists can share fears, build one another's confiden ce, and contribute toward group unity. A typical training session, which lasts eight hours and in- volves two trainers and ten to twen ty-five people, asks participants to role play various scenarios th at will prepare them for the per- sonal and legal confrontati ons their action could entail."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"B ASIC T ACTICS 73 In addition to the traditional an tiwar and antinuclear campaigns, nonviolence training is being used as part of the nationwide move- ment against violent crime. Dori c Wilsnack of the War Resisters League said that groups such as Alternatives to Violence in New York City are teaching nonviolence philosophy and tactics to prison inmates and high school kids to help them learn how to re- solve conflicts peacefully.

To determine whether civil disobedience is the appropriate tac tic for your particular fight, he recommends the following f our steps, designed by King. • •STEP BY STEP• • How to Engage in a Nonviolent Action • Investigation. Collect information about your particular is- sue and the laws or policies you feel are unjust. • Negotiation. Communicate with the people who have the power to change the law or policy, and request change. Publicize the issue, meet with legislators and policy makers, take some of the other actions suggested in this book before resorting to break- ing the law. • Self-purification. If negotiations break down and other tools fail, do some soul searching and spiritual preparation for the ac- tion. Determine whether your membership has the sense of peace and mental discipline to demonstrate without lashing out at opponents who may themselves resort to violence. (Some may worry that arrests wi ll generate negative publicity that will set back their cause, or that donors might discontinue their support. For activists wo rking under the philosophy of nonviolence, however, Moore says, economic considerations are not among their top concerns.)"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"74 L AYING THE F OUNDATION How to Engage in a Nonviolent Action (cont.) • Direct action.

Will people travel in order to attend your event, or just wander in because they are already in the area? If they are just wandering by. how can they be drawn in? Banners, bal- loons, and music attract people on the street. Station leaflet distributors on nearby corners on the day of the event to in- vite visitors to attend. • How long will people stay?

Children, teenagers, adults, and seniors will be attracted to very different kinds of events and services. And they can be reached by different media sources. (Not many teenag ers read the daily paper and not many elderly people listen to rock stations.) Decide what kind of audience you want to attract, then organize activities those participants will find appealing. • Should you hold a press conference?

Then call the station and ask to speak with either the di- rector of marketing or promotions, or the disc jockey you want to approach. Convince the station that the event will generate as much goodwill for the station as it will for the event. National Night Out Against Crime Like so many neighborhoods in this country, the New York City community of southeast Queens has a drug problem. Most dealing is done on the streets among the area's youth, and relations between kids and police can get pretty tense. The South East Queens Community Partnership (SEQCP) has made every attempt to curb potential aggression and improve relationships between cops and kids by setting up civil patrols and training some cops as CPOPs—Community Policing Officer Patrolmen—to be more sensitive to kids, minorities, and the cultural challenges that ha ve developed in the com- munity, which is 75 to 80 percent African American and Caribbean American. Despite growing hostilities toward police around the country, SEQCP also helps bridge the gap between civilians and police with its annual Night Out Against Crime.

Why not them? In early summer 1991, Part nership staff members and volunteers from member as sociations began planning for that August 6. Through a little persuasion, they got a local supermarket owner in Cambria Heights to give up half his parki ng lot for the event. Security and permitting were by far the group s biggest hurdles.

SEQCP and the police collaborated on rerouting traffic to avoid interfering w ith bus routes. A local hous- ing development donated main tenance people and trucks, the City Parks Department pr ovided the stage apparatus, and the police brought in the floodlight unit. \"One of the hallmarks of our group is our ability to co- ordinate among different agencies,\" Robert Sinclair, Jr.,"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"B ASIC T ACTICS 83 a spokesperson for the Partnership, said.

There are four sizable African American newspapers in New York City and many sm aller papers published on the community level. SEQCP and its civic and block as- sociation members spread the word via their newslet- ters.

Kids got their own operations going, too: the Positive Youth Connec- tion, one of the Partnership' s programs, bought soda in bulk, and the kids sold soda s for $1 each and kept the profits. \"We have some enterprising youngsters here,\" Sinclair laughed. A letter to the New York Mets organi- zation produced a carload of donated paraphernalia— such as posters, packets of team photos from 1961 to 1992, and figurines of former players—that was either given away or sold throughout the night.

BUILDING YOUR ORGANIZATION B EING A SUCCESSFUL hell-raiser is no easy task. What sustains many groups facing enormous challeng es, occasional demoralizing de- feats, and the constant stress of insufficient capital is a solid orga- nization that has learned how to command a troupe of loyal members and stretch resources by wo rking in coalition with others. Organizations with lesser attributes may be able to win a few bat- tles, but if they want to win the wa r, they need to build a solid or- ganization that, ultimately, gives people power over their own lives. INCORPORATING Your organization doesn't have to be a legal entity to meet as a group, use a name, fund-raise, and accomplish great things. In fact, activists who wage just an occasi onal campaign often find it easier to remain an ad hoc operation that can disband when the campaign ends, than to go through the legal hassle and paperwork of incor- porating into an institution that w ill require some level of resources to maintain. 86"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"B UILDING Y OUR O RGANIZATION 87 On the other hand, groups that have a long-term agenda often decide to incorporate, a legal act that legitimizes the group as a business and allows a group to apply to the Inte rnal Revenue Ser- vice for nonprofit, tax-exempt status, a qualification that signifi- cantly enhances fund-ra ising opportunities. Most of the information presen ted in this bo ok is relevant whether you incorporate or not. Bu t should you decide to do so, these tips will help you out. How Do You Incorporate? You'll need to come up with a na me for your group, a statement of purpose, and the legal document s for incorporati on used in your state. These will probably include your Articles of Incorporation, which describe the natu re of your business and list the officers of the group; and your bylaws, whic h describe how you plan to op- erate (vacation policy, sick leav e, employee review process, availability of health benefits, and so on). Though you may be able to take care of this paperwork your- self, many groups feel more co mfortable if a lawyer handles incorporation for them. Eventually, you will probably want to de- sign an emblem or logo to repres ent your group visually, and have stationery printed, but t h i s is not necessary for incorporation. While you're at it, determine wh ether you need a business license with the city or coun ty in which you'll be operating. Contact the business licensing division, tell them what you plan to do. and they'll direct you to the right department. A business can be incorporated as either a for-profit or nonprofit concern. Activists who band togeth er into an organization usually opt for nonprofit status, primarily to lake advantage of the fund- raising benefits that status allows them to pursue. Key among these is th at a nonprofit can become recognized by the Internal Revenue Se rvice (IRS) as tax-e xempt and thereby re- ceive tax-deductible contributions , an attribute that makes the group very appealing to potential d onors who wish to make contri- butions but want a tax advantage for doing so. In addition, the assets of a nonp rofit cannot accrue to a private individual. Whatever assets a no nprofit organization possesses have got to be used for the express purpose around which the or- ganization has been established- Other benefits nonprofits enjoy include the opportunity to obtain a bulk mail permit, which essen- tially deeply discounts postage co sts, and to participate in a simpler tax filing process."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"88 L AYING THE F OUNDATION There are several nonprofit categories an organization can con- sider, but most activist groups will opt to become either a 501(c)(3) or a 501(c)(4) organization.

According to Nonprofit Organizations, Public Policy, and the Political Process: A Guide to the Internal Revenue Code and Fed- eral Election Campaign Act. prepared by the Washington. DC. law firm of Perkins Coie, a 501(c)(3) organization is a nonprofit corpo- ration, unincorporated association, or trust that engages in educa- tional, religious, scientific, or other charitable activities and is exempt from federal income tax under the Internal Revenue Code. Contributions to a 501(c)(3) organization may be accepted from in- dividuals and corporations, and are deductible from the donor's federal income tax. In addition, a 501(c)(3) organization may be funded by foundation grants. As a condition of its tax-exempt status, a 501(c)(3) organization is subject to restrictions on its lobbying activity, by which the or- ganization seeks to influence action by the Congress or a state or local legislature. Tax-exempt 501( c)(3) organizations are also pro- hibited from engaging in any pa rtisan political campaign activity. (A 501(c)(3) is permitted to conduc t some lobbying and voter ed- ucation activities, as outlined in Ch apter 8. \"Action at the Polls.\") An organization must apply to the Internal Revenue Service for recognition of tax-exempt status under section 501(c)(3). The Ap- plication for Recognition of Exemption, IRS Form 1023, requests a detailed financial statement an d information about the organiza- tion's present and proposed activ ities, purpose for formation, sources of funding, and governing stru cture. In addition, copies of the organizing documents, such as Articles of Incorporation and bylaws, must be provided. Forms are available through the na tional and regional offices of the IRS. The IRS will review the application and either deny ex- emption, request additional information, or issue a determination letter recognizing 501(c)(3) status. In order to avoid an adverse de- cision, the application should be f illed out with care; it is advisable to consult someone familiar with the procedure and knowledgeable about tax-exempt organizations.

Most citizens groups rarely have much money (see Chapter 5. \"Fund-raising,\" to learn how to raise more). What they do have is people. And the more they build up their people capital, the more powerful they become. Still, the size of your membership alone does not automatically translate into political clout. Th e level and nature of membership involvement in the group's issues have much greater political sig- nificance. You may have a lot of members on paper, but unless they march, write letters, attend meetings, and testify, they won't make their presence felt—and the target of your campaign will have little to fear. Who should you recruit? Obviously you can't afford to recruit everybody. (Which is fine, because not everybody is going to want to join you anyway.) In most cases, and especially if you are just beginning your campaign, your resources are goi ng to be pretty limited. So you need to think carefully: What ki nd of organization do you want to have? A neighborhood alliance com posed of dues-paying members who live near the problem? A co alition of disparate groups who share a common concern? An associ ation with an elected leader- ship and formal committees to help organize, raise money, and promote your cause? To answer these questions, revi ew your strategic goals and ob- jectives. Identify the constituencies in your community that will most likely want to help you ac hieve your objectives. And figure out how much help you're going to need to win—and from whom. Remember that people join organizations for very different rea- sons. Some are altruists: They ha ve a genuine concern for the pub- lic good, and even though the is sue at hand may not affect them at all, they'll join the organizat ion or contribute money because it is the \"right\" thing to do. Others have a direct self-interest in the work the organization is doing. Parents who joined the Mothers of East L.A. did so because they were personally concerned a bout their children's future.

But these \"members\" see themselves more as sub- scribers or consumers and are unlike ly to participate actively in the organization.

At organizing meetings, present your suggestions, offer success sto- ries from other groups, and solicit ideas from others. • Identify activities that will move people into some form of mass action. Establish committees to get people to work and recruit new members. Set up information tables at shop- ping malls, county fairs, farmers' markets, political forums, town meetings, other community events. Hand out literature, buttons, bumper stickers. Talk to people. Circulate peti- tions. Ask people to sign their names, addresses, and phone numbers so you can contact them later. (See Chapter 3 for more information about organizi ng a petition drive.) Post bro- chures, fliers, leaflets, or other material on bulletin boards at churches and temples, supermarkets, on college campuses, and in libraries. • Canvass. Cesar Chavez, the famous community and labor organizer who was president of the United Farm Workers Union, was once asked, \"How do you organize?\" He said. \"First, you talk to one person, face-to-face, then you talk to an- other. . . .\" This is the essence of canvassing (also called doorknocking): making a personal appeal to someone else to join your organization, take part in the campaign, and contribute to the cause. To get started, identify a neighb orhood; start with areas most likely to be concerned about the problem.

Rehearse your pitch with othe rs in your organization to prepare mentally for going door-t o-door. Try different scenarios involving various responses—friendly, indifferent, hostile—so you won't be taken aback by the reactions you get from people who open their door to you. Knock. Introduce yourself and your organization. Make it clear why your issue is legitimate . Have a conversation. Ask the person who answers the door about the issues that concern him or her most. Describe solutions you feel would address the issue at hand; ask your neighbor's opi nion. Ask if she or he will be- come a member and invite him or her to the next event or meeting. Regardless of whether the person becomes a member, request a contribution (or the price of membership) to help sup- port the campaign. Some groups also engage in direct mail to recruit new members. Advocates of this tactic believe it gives you the opportunity to make a careful, complete and thoughtf ul pitch to potential recruits about the important work your orga nization is doing and what you have to offer. It also allows you to reach very large numbers of po- tential members with very little staff time- But the down side is significant. Usually, the return rate—the number of people who respond to the mailing by joining your group—will be quite low, less than 1 percent. The mail package it- self, which includes a letter, envelope, return envelope, member- ship card, and perhaps a window decal—is expensive, and you need funds upfront to put the package together, print it, and mail it. Sometimes these expenses are never recovered. Furthermore, getting members through the mail may create a passive, uninvolved membership that doesn't respond to your calls for direct action. If you decide to go the direct ma il route, you can identify lists of potential recruits by borrowing or exchanging lists with similar organizations, signing up people at events, and by obtaining state voter lists.

You need more resources, clout, or credibility than your organiza tion can provide alone. That's when you need to build a coalition. The coalition doesn't need to be a formal. legal entity. It could consist of an ad hoc arrangement among representatives of various groups united by a common position on a s i n g l e issue. Or it could be an organization itself, set up as an ongoing network of groups that share a similar approach on se veral issues. As a more formal entity, it could have its own letter head and staff and require mem- bers to pay dues. When should you form or join a coalition? Bill Robinson, exec- utive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, believes: \"You get massive coalition efforts when the stakes are truly high and there is an u ltimate goal that everybody can sub- scribe to, and understand why they must submerge their individual and organizational interests.\" Answering these questions will help you decide whether to par- ticipate in a coalition: • What power would other groups bring to the coalition? Do other groups have greater a ccess to elected officials, the media, or other institution s whose support you need? Do they have more resources—in terms of money, people, or equipment? • What problems would other groups bring? Have they re- ceived bad publicity that would somehow reflect negatively on you? Have they alienated organizations that you hoped would also join your coalitio n? Would you have to support them financially if th ey joined your effort? • What does your group stand to gain or lose by working in a coalition? Will you get less cred it than you deserve be- cause you have to share the li melight with others? Will the coalition cost you more becaus e you have to support the work of others? Or will you profit from being associated with organizations and individu als who have more credibility or resources than you do? • What issues will you need to avoid if you work in coali- tion with others?

Or can these issues be put aside until the coalition effort succeeds? • Under what sort of structu re will the coalition function? Will it incorporate, in which case you may be asked to be- come a board member or officer of the new group? Will it be a formal entity that may not have legal standing but still prints up stationery and has members who develop and im- plement strategy? Or will it be an informal coalition that only kicks into gear on occasion to testify at a public hearing or write a letter to the editor? • What groups are potential coalition members? What other organizations share your values completely and can operate as full partners in the coaliti on? What organizations don't you agree with on every issue but can put differences aside for the time being to coalesce behind the issue at hand? • How will the coalition function? Will members consist only of those who pay dues? Or provide some in-kind service? Will officers be elected from the members? Who makes de- cisions? Officers, members, or both? Sometimes you may cooperate cl osely with other groups with- out joining their coalition. You can share information, attend meetings, participate when appropriate in activities, like signing coalition letters and appearing at news conferences, and offer orga- nizational resources when doing so doesn't compromise your posi- tions. Working in this way allows you to add your strengths to those of other organizations whil e maintaining your independence, thereby avoiding association wi th any positions you have not taken. Coalitions should be as broad as possible in order to demon- strate wide support for an issue and make it difficult if not impos- sible for your opponents to ignore your demands. (Coalitions of unlikely partners, such as labor and industry, urban and rural com- munities, agricultural interests, and environmentalists, are almost unbeatable.) To repeat an important point, build coalitions with natural allies, but look for new allie s, too. An issue that can unite adversarial partners makes a powerful statement about that issue, proving it is of widespread public concern."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"96 L AYING THE F OUNDATION • • STEP BY STEP • • How to Build a Coalition • Identify organizations and indi viduals who want to be in- volved in a joint effort on the issue. Compile a list of those who are most likely to share your concerns, then add to it names of people and groups who may have a peripheral interest in the issue but are still worth contacting. • Familiarize these activists with each other, the substance of the issue, and the goals of the campaign. Hold a meeting of all interested parties. Prepare a written summary of the issue, augmenting it with newspaper clippings, research reports, testi- mony, or other documentation. Discuss the goals of the cam- paign and ask for input from participants in refining those goals. • Develop specific approaches, stra tegies, and time lines that are action-oriented. Work either in the whole group or within a smaller strategy committee to refi ne your plans and identify spe- cific tactics to use in pursuing your goals. Develop a realistic time line that sets deadlines for services to be rendered by coa- lition members and that anticipates deadlines that may be im- posed on you, such as a specifi c vote or a construction date. • Share the work. In the most effective coalitions, everyone pitches in. Some groups lobby, others maintain mailing lists, others write press releases and testimony, and others organize events. Give every member of th e coalition a job. Each organi- zation should do what it does best. The whole should be greater than the sum of its parts. • Take one issue at a time. Don't try to create a new coalition around several controversial issues all at the same time. Begin with one issue, and as trust and understanding develop among coalition members, explore oppor tunities to expand the interests of the coalition into other arenas. • Spread the credit and praise for those who complete coa- lition tasks.

For example, in August 1992, a neighborhood health center for poor people opened in one section of the building. \"The health center came ab out because some of the young health professionals who helped us stuff envel- opes and gave church presen tations during the fund- raising period started dreami ng about running their own clinic,\" according to Prudence.

If you had told the inexperienced residents of Over-the-Rhine that someday they'd raise more than $200,000. buy a building, and establish their own neighborhood cen ter, they would have scoffed in disbelief. Yet raise the money is exactly wh at they did. partly through sheer grit, and in larger part by acquiring essential fund-raising skills that continue to help their center thrive. As the Peaslee campaign showed , there are as many ways to raise money as there are to spend it. You don't need to be a pro- fessional fund-raiser or have a lot of money yourself to success- fully generate funds for your group. You do need to understand why people give. WHY PEOPLE GIVE \"People give because it serves their self-interest,\" writes Kim Klein in Fundraising for Social Change (Chardon Press, 1994). The driving force that compels peop le to part with their money. whether through a purchase or a don ation, is the need to satisfy their own desires for comfort or peace of mind. The interest may be purely materialistic: Some donor s like to receive tangible goods in exchange for their contribution, which is why fund-raising \"pre- miums\" like calendars and books are so popular. Others believe strongly in an organization's mission and the issues the group is trying to address. Then there ar e donors who choose to give to a particular group because its work relates, however remotely, to their own lives. People also donate because they feel guilty, they feel proud, or because they're angry. They may write a check because they can't write a letter. They may call five friends on the phone and ask them to give because they would feel less comfortable calling five legislators and asking for their votes. They may give money be- cause they are loyal to the organiza tion. Maybe they just need a tax write-off. Whatever the reasons, giving enables people to \"reinforce their image of themselves\" as, for example, feminists, environmental- ists, conservatives, or patriots. Klein writes. Donors thus get a"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"FUND-RAISING 115 boost in self-esteem by giving; they can tell themselves that they helped someone else t oday—someone like them. It is important for you as a fund-raiser to remember not only that people give for themselves but specifically that they do not give simply because it will benefit your group. According to Klein, many nonprofits get on the wrong track by relying on singular ap- peals like \"We need the money\" and \"Your gift is tax-deductible.\" These points do not set you apart; all groups can claim to need money and most offer tax deduc tions. \"Imagine your donors as customers,\" she advises fund-raisers. \"Move away from your need to their need.\" Believe that people do want to help you out, and that most peo- ple will give what they can. It's your job to convey to them what an opportunity it is to support \"t he most valuable program in the community.\" They'll dig into their pockets, if only you'll ask. Here's a terrific example of an activist who did ask—in a vari- ety of ways—and raised the money his group needed to defeat the construction of three hazardous inci nerators that were proposed for his town. A Gopher for Funds A carpenter by trade, Bob Forney has a second occupa- tion in the \"building\" field, though it has more to do with dollars and cents than hammers and nails: He raises money for Citizens for a Healthy Environment (CHE), a grass roots group located in Summit Station, Pennsylvania, that uses every dollar Forney scrapes up to build and strengthen the organization. One of Forney's biggest challenges was to raise money to support CHE's fight against the petroleum- burning incinerator proposed for the town. The self- proclaimed \"gopher for funds\" claims he had great success asking for donations from local businesses. Ap- pealing to the merchants' fina ncial self-interests, as well as their appreciation for the facts, Forney helped them weigh the pros and cons of the incinerator proposal. \"I told them that the hazards accompanying the incinerator would override the number of jobs gained,\" he said. He"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"116 L AYING THE F OUNDATION also argued that customers would move away if the fa- cility were built. The merchants responded with donations averaging $25 to $50 each, and dozens of businesses contributed more than once. (A used car lot eventually allowed the group unlimited use of its copy and fax machines.) Peo- ple, he found, will give again if a reasonable case for additional support is presented, and especially if a dead- line is approaching. Fired up by Forney's success, CHE took advantage of public events to sell merchandise and raise even more money. They held bake sale s at public meetings about the incinerator, at community fairs, and at block parties. (Forney claims that probably every one of Summit Sta- tion's 3,900 residents baked at least once for CHE!) At a public auction, CHE members sold soup they had made, as well as barbecue, hamburgers, and drinks do- nated by a local restaurant. Not ones to pass up any opportunity, the CHE orga- nizers set out donation jars at their meetings, adding the change and occasional dollars people contributed to Members of Citizens for a Healthy Environment and Citizens Asainst In- cineration work at their sales pavilion at the Schuylkill County Fair Kate Potter and Bob Forney are second and third from the left.

They also sold buttons de- claring \"BAN THE BURNERS SCHUYLKILL COUNTY GREEN FOREVER \" and bumper stickers that announced \" I ' M PRO - ENVIRONMENT AND I VOTE.\" In a region where the aver age family income is only $23,000. Bob was able to raise over $4,000 in ten months to help cov er CHE's expenses. To earn more money, Forney built a pavilion at the county fair so that the gr oup could sell its buttons and bumper stickers, as well as plants and more baked goods, while they distributed their educational materials. CHE sold these bumper stickers to members of the community for $1. \"We reached thousands of pe ople that way,\" Forney said. \"We had to open their eyes.\" For not only was CHE battling the owners of th e incinerator, it was also fighting an uphill battle agai nst residents who supported the facility because of the jobs they believed it would bring to the community. To help CHE gather information and pinch pennies at the same time, local engine ers and scientists offered their technical expertise pro bono, helping to ana- lyze the implications of the proposed facility on the entire county. The group raised enough mo ney to keep going, pro- ducing information sheets and news releases that, in 1992. helped persuade legislat ors to defeat the original incinerator proposal, two additional incinerator propos- als, and a new landfill.

DEVELOP A FUND-RAISING STRATEGY Fund-raising, like the other organizing tools discussed in this book, can help build and strengt hen your group—as long as you have put in place a carefully craf ted strategy that meshes with your short- and long-term organization al goals and objectives. Where do you start? • Clarify your tax status. Decide whether to apply for 501(c)(3) tax status, which will classify your group as a non- profit organization. Though being classified by the IRS as such is not legally necessary for you to receive money, do- nors can only make tax-deduct ible donations if you are a 501(c)(3). Remember that in order to obtain an IRS tax sta- tus, you must incorporate. (F or tips on how to incorporate and file the proper documents, see Chapter 4, \"Building Your Organization.\") • Develop a fund-raising committee. The fund-raising coor- dinator keeps track of how much money is coming in, where it's coming from, what specific fund-raising events you have planned, and the fund-raising calendar. Others on the com- mittee actually get out and ra ise the money, whether that means selling products, collecting donations door-to-door, or staging fund-raising events. All of those on the committee should be willing to ask for money—and collect it. • Set goals. You will gain self-sufficiency from a well- planned, long-range fund-raisin g campaign that enables you to pay staff ( i f necessary), buy supplies, maintain your pro- grams, and generally sustai n the organization. Having enough money will give you not only independence but also peace of mind. Obviously, it will also help you meet pro- gram goals and build your membership. • Figure out how much money you need. This is the million-"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"F UND - RAISING 119 dollar question. The amount of money you ne ed will change as your organization grows in size, matures in outlook, and develops in ambition. Don't try to raise $100,000 to hire sev- eral staff, buy computers, and rent an office when you're or- ganizing a temporary campaign and all you really need is $500 to pay the phone bill and print up fliers. On the other hand, don't continually try to scrape by on $1,000 a year when you're finally ready to turn your volunteer operation into a staff-paid organization that requires higher personnel and overhead costs. • Prepare a complete calendar with specific fund-raising deadlines scheduled th roughout the year. Hold major fund-raising events at the same time every year so people get used to giving to you annually. Consider whether certain hol- idays lend themselves to speci al fund-raising appeals. Try to develop discreet programs—the annual release of an assess- ment of the problem you're tr ying to correct, a day or week in which you mobilize volu nteers for a community- improvement activity—around which you can raise money. • Ask frequently. You have to raise money for your organiza- tion year-round if it is going to survive and grow. Keep in mind that people who go to chur ch are used to giving every week. Many grass roots organizations solicit a donation from their members at least once a month. Others ask twice a month, while some ask every two months. Reminds expert fund-raiser Amy Leveen, \"If yo u don't ask, you won't get. The more often you ask. the mo re often you'll get. And the more you ask for, the more y ou'll get.\" Adds Jenny Thomp- son, a direct mail specialist with Craver, Mathews, Smith & Co., \"People will give again if they understand what hap- pened with the money they gave and why additional funds are needed. The calendar doe sn't determin e when you need money. Need does.\" • Keep accurate records. Follow the standard rules of account- ing to keep track of your fi nances. If you are paying a staff, know when to file the proper state and federal taxes\" for em- ployees, as well as income t axes for your group. Though you can probably read a book on how it's supposed to be done, you're better off hiring a part -time accountant who can help you keep track of it all.

Make sure you get a prof essional audit annually—most foundations and corporate grantm akers will want an audit as proof that you're operating in a fiscally responsible manner. • Find the right bank. When looking for a bank, choose one with a history of being responsive to your community. Does the bank \"red line\" neighborhoods, refusing to give loans in low-income or minority comm unities? If so, you may want to take your business elsewhere. You may also want to ex- plore working with a credit union or community co-op. Once you choose a bank, get advice on the different kinds of savings and checking accounts available. At the right time, you may also want to talk with the bank about estab- lishing a line of credit to help you through periods when cash flow is weak. Also, don't forget to turn to your friends for things like interest-free loans to buy postage or cover printing. • Avoid debt. As much as possible, avoid incurring debt. No- body likes to help somebody else pay for items that have al- ready been bought or an activity that has already taken place. Keep track of your expenses and how much they're going to cost; if you don't have the mone y to cover them, scale back until you do.

Answering the Million-Dollar Question To set your fund-raising budget, fi rst anticipate what your ex- penses for the year are going to be. Calculate the following: • How many paid staff members (if any) does your organi- zation employ? In addition to their salary, you'll have to pay federal, state, and perhaps city taxes, as well as FICA and Social Security. • What benefits do you offer? Most organizations provide at least a modest health insurance plan. Is your group also con- templating child care, reimburse ment for transportation or parking, or tuition rebates for continuing education courses? Do you have vacation and sick leave? Figure all of these costs into your budget. • How much rent do you pay? Also calculate in related of- fice expenses, such as telephone, heating an d cooling, sta- tionery, subscriptions, transpor tation, and office supplies. • What special publications a re you planning that will require additional funds? These could include the design and printing of a newsletter, annual report, press kit, or back- ground brochure on your group. • What special events are you planning? You should develop a separate budget for these \"big ticket\" events."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"122 L AYING THE F OUNDATION Try to find an accountant who will work with you. at least ini- tially, on a pro bono or reduced-fee basis.

It's a lot easier to sell one $100 ad than twenty $5 raffle tickets. Fund-raising and Computers People may only give to people, but computers can certainly help keep track of the transacti ons. Thorough fund-raising can in- volve a vast amount of paperwork, especially when a group is try- ing to maintain perso nal and business inform ation on individual and company donors and tailor its a ppeals to those characteristics. Once your mailing list reaches five hundred names, you should consider storing it on a computer. Chapter 6 offers some tips on ho w to get a computer donated. But whether you buy a computer or get one for free, make sure it has enough memory to st ore all your data and to run the software programs you want to use. The two most important programs are a word processing program and a mailing list program. The word processing program should be able to merge the mailing list and a form letter so that a series of lett ers is printed that differs only in address and salutation (this is ca lled \"mail merge\"). The program should also be able to move paragraphs around and change docu- ment margins and length easily. The mailing list program should be able to sort through thousands of names and addresses in sev- eral different ways—by zip code, membership type , and so forth. Fund-raising software packages may seem like an extravagant out- lay of money, but they end up savi ng incalculable money and man- power—while increasing fund-raising profits. Cathy Folkes of Real Good Software, who has done extensiv e research on fund-raising soft- ware for grass roots groups, shak es her head in wonderment when small organizations balk at package price tags, then assign an em- ployee or volunteer to hours and hours of paperwork recording and updating files—a job a software package coul d manage in minutes.

More sophisticated packages may cost $4,000 or more, but some companies will lease packages so organizations can pay on a monthly basis. ASKING FOR MONEY Many people are intimidated by aski ng for money. Veteran grass roots fund-raising consultant Jo an Flanagan says: \"Asking for money is like going out to beat up a bear. The larger the amount, the more frightening it becomes, because you have to beat up a bigger bear.\" The less fearful you are of the task, the smaller the bear will be- come. Review the reasons why peop le give, then ask yourself what they want in return. As much as possible, put yourself in your do- nor's shoes. Why do you support the group you're raising money for? If you have no qualms about gi ving the group money, chances are other donors won't be nervous about it either. Ask yourself, what's the wors t thing that can happen to you when you ask donors for money? They might say no. That's it. End of consequences. On the other hand, they might say maybe, and ask you to send more information. And they might say yes, in which case you walk away happy and a bit richer. Thought of in these terms, asking for money doesn't seem so painful, does it? Personalize your appeals for money as much as you can. Notes or individual attention of any kind make donors feel important. Re- member the old fund-raising adage: People give to people. In The Art of Asking (The Taft Group, 1985), Paul H. Schneiter writes: \"In-person asking consistently pr oduces more and larger contribu- tions than any other solicitati on technique\" by imposing urgency and pressure to respond on the s pot. If you can't make a face-to- face request for money, use the telephone. Create fund-raising letters or brochures that are as intimate and heart-wrenching as possible. Add personal notes when you are mailing to someone you know. Hit home with a story so human that readers can easily identify with the characters, or so tragic that even the most callous reader will feel compassion for them (and feel darn glad that they are not in their shoes)."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"124 L AYING THE F OUNDATION • • STEP BY STEP • • How to Ask for Money Just Do It! • Just ask. Don't think for a minute that simply by doing a great job on an important issue, pe ople will want to contribute. You've got to ask. The worst thing that can happen is that the donor will say no. • Ask family and friends. Aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents, neighbors, co-workers ... the same people who buy your daugh- ter's holiday greeting cards or son's magazine subscriptions. • Ask for a specific amount. If you need $25 from all one hundred people you're asking, say so. You can also give poten- tial donors a range to choose from, say $10, $25. $35. and $50. • Be direct. Don't be coy. Explain your needs straightfor- wardly so that people will clearly understand how much money you need and what you need the money for. • Zip your lips. Once you actually ask. \"Will you give us the money?\" don't say another word. Avoid the instinct to rush in and fill the pregnant pause that usually follows every request. If you wait for the prospective donor to speak next, it forces the donor to respond and prevents you from succumbing to the im- pulse to take back what you've just said. • Contribute yourself. How can you expect others to give if you haven't anted up yourself? And don't forget to canvass your own membership and board. • Ask for enough money. Don't set your expectations too low because you can't believe donors would give you as much money as you really need. This is espe cially true for foundations and banks. (I once nervously went to the bank where my organization had a checking account to pursue a $15,000 loan. The bank officer interviewed me extensively and said \"Hmmmm\" a lot; when the loan was approved, it was for $25, 000. \"You need more than you're asking for.\" the wise banker told me. He was right.) • Don't give up. Just because someone says no once or twice doesn't mean he or she won't gi ve the third time you ask. Keep trying."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"F UND - RAISING 125 How to Ask for Money (cont.) • Give people options. Some donors prefer paying member- ship dues. Others like to get me rchandise in exchange for their donation. And still others want to fund a service, like the plant- ing of a tree or the provision of meals in a shelter. Let people \"buy\" something with their contribution. • Ask face-to-face. It's much easier for people to turn you down if they don't have to l ook you in the eye and say no. • Ask again. The most likely donors ar e those who have al- ready given you money. Most churches ask for money at least once a week. You can probably ask a few times a year. • Say thank you. Send a note, make a quick phone call, list donors' names in your newsletter, or hand out a certificate. Par- ticularly large contributors should be recognized with a plaque or an award.

In addition to boosting finances, fund- raising activities help build the organization as they expand your bank account, making people work together as a team to make the event a success.

His life could have been one long downhill slide. But tenacious counseling helped th is young man realize that it was the abuse, and not some inherent evil trait, that was primarily responsible for his destructive behavior. Vowing to raise funds to help other abused children, Smitty asked employees at the MacLaren facility to pledge money for every mile he ran in the fortified com- pound where he lived.

The Trust Fund, Walker said, arranged with a local department store to place at its checkout counters promo- tional cards that explained the ca mpaign and contained special bar codes. Parents purchasing back-to-school gear picked up the card. which read: \"Just include this car d with your purchases and one dollar will be added to your total.. .. You will support over twenty abuse prevention programs statewide.\" The clerk scanned the mock department store tag printed on th e card along with other clothing tags, collected one extra dollar from the purchaser, and then turned over all contributions to the Trust Fund. The back of the card— which the parent could keep—contained shopping tips such as \"Never let your child use an escalator unattended.\" According to fund-raiser Jenny T hompson, whose firm consults with many grassroots and nationa l nonprofit organizations, the most successful fund-raising events ar e those that relate directly to the work of the organization. In other words, it makes more sense for a group concerned about subs tance abuse to host a premier about a film dealing with drugs and alcoholism than one about di- nosaurs or rainforests.

Remember that what drives people to join is es- sentially the same as what motivates them to give, ratcheted up an emotional notch or two. Richard P. Trenbeth, author of The Membership Mystique (Fundraising Institute. 1986), says many people become paying members of a group because they need to \"belong\" to something larger than themselves and crave the \"elevated societal level\" to which they believe they rise when they join. Others, he believes, hope to gain knowledge from the group that will help them solve personal problems. Then there are those who just want to fill their empty mailbox with membership mail. All of these motives may be summed up as self-interest.

For $10.000 to $15,000, y ou can conduct a scientifically based, statistically meaningful telephone or mail survey to ask new members, old members, and potential members (selected randomly to insure that they are not biased ) questions that probe clues as to how much money people are willi ng to pay to join your group or support your cause. One way to set the membership price is to discuss what the group wants to do in the coming year. Estimate what those activ- ities will cost, how much money you can raise from nonmember- ship sources like fund-raising events and foundation grants, and set dues to recover the rest. You may also need to create alternatives to allow all members to \"pay\" their dues even if they don't have money. Students, senior citizens, and the unemployed may be able to earn their member- ship with \"sweat equity,\" volu nteering a certain number of hours to clean the office, file documents , answer the telephone, or pro- gram computers. While many national organizations charge up to $35 for an an- nual membership, local groups may st art off at $5, $10, or $15. Because any potential donor base consists of people with vastly different interests and income le vels, many organizations give the check writer a number of donation levels to choose from. Hopefully, your membership will grow along with your plans. As you begin to count on a stable membership, you can set your membership price at one level, so that it doesn't change year after year. Always be on the lookout for new members, who will soon be- come a source of revenue and su pport.

Older kids need after-school direction and supervision, too, yet sat- isfactory programs for young t eenagers can be hard to come by. At least this is what the League of Women Voters (LWV) of Metro Columbus, Ohio, found when they be- gan to look into after-school opportunities for sixth, sev- enth, and eighth graders. In fact, there were virtually no opportunities at all in the ar ea, which is 70 percent non- white and in which 90 percent of middle schoolers are on reduced-rate lunches. Ten-to-thirteen-year-olds are difficult to manage, said Suzanne Fahey, then presiden t of the League chapter, because they are old enough to require skilled instruc- tors but still have short atte ntion spans. League volun- teers decided to create a sc hool-age-child-care program for these youths, but had few financial resources to throw behind the effort. Traditional fund-raising techniques—such as selling fruit to the community dur- ing Christmas—simply didn't work; residents just didn't have extra money to spend on fund-raising gimmicks. The League also found it very difficult to get parents to pay for their kids' participation- When they an- nounced that the after-school program would cost only $25 for the year, no one signed up. Back at square one, the League set up a \"community round table\" to assess what sort of resources the area would likely invest in the program. The activists found that their fellow community groups—the YMCA and the YWCA, the United Way, 4-H, the Girl Scouts—not only supported the idea but offered to help in any way possible. Each group donated either money or instruc- tors for after-school activities, whatever it could afford. Most groups found that by donating manpower they would not strain their lim ited budgets and would still provide the program with a valuable resource. The"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"140 L AYING THE F OUNDATION YWCA began by sending one person one day per week to run an activity, as did the Columbus Recreation De- partment, despite its own lack of funds. The Salesian Boys' Club offered to transport kids from school to their facilities if need be, and offered tutoring services. The YMCA was not having a ny luck attracting middle school kids to its own fac ility, so its Black Achievers Program sent a volunteer once a week to work with the League's more successful effort. The program made good us e of the middle schools gym, equipment, and space. \"To me, the beautiful thing is that the school is open. Th e staff has gone home; that facility has become a commun ity resource to help the boys and girls. These kids love that school!\" exclaimed the League's Fahey. The League provided supervised sports, computer instruction, cooking classes, and Afri- can dance demonstration. The kids even produced a puppet show on drug preventio n, which proved both in- structional and effective in building self-esteem. \"Giv- ing them an activity is the same thing as prevention,\" Fahey said. League members worked nonst op to solicit grants to support their program's star t-up. Fahey applied for and received a $2,500 grant fro m the Columbus Human Ser- vices Department that paid for two staff members who manned activities every day. The group also secured grants from the City of Co lumbus, the Columbus Foun- dation, the state's Department of Education, the Junior League, the Ohio Commissi on on Minority Health, and COMP DRUG, a drug prevention organization—in all, raising $17,000 to fund th e program's kickoff year. The League reduced the fee it charged kids to $1 per afternoon, and when this s till proved excessive, to $.25. Though nominal, the charge proved sufficient to pay for the kids' daily snacks, whic h were purchased extremely cheaply from the Mid-Ohio Food Bank, a business that distributes food inexpensively to nonprofits. Early in its first year, around twelve kids showed up. \"With this age group,\" noted Fahey, \"they'll only come if it's the cool thing to do.\" Often parents were working, but for the most part, kids came because they had noth- ing better to do after school .

Since the League of Women Voters was not set up to be a fiscal agent for this type of operation, its goal from the beginning was to secure a stable sponsor to run the program and handle its funding. Eventually, the Colum- bus YWCA took charge, allowing the League to chan- nel its efforts into seeding similar projects in two other Columbus middle schools. Matching Grants Matching grants require an orga nization to \"match\" or raise all or part of the grant with money secured in other ways. Some grants will give you a dollar for every dollar you raise; others match two-to-one or three-to-one . Creating a matching grant pro- gram is a way for a foundation to hedge its bets, to protect itself when funding a new organization that doesn't have a track record, or to prevent the organization from becoming too dependent on foundation support. Plus, grass root s groups can give their mem- bers and donors the psychological benefit of knowing that every dollar they give is at least doubled. According to the Ms. Foundation, \"Wily old Ben Franklin was the first person in America to use the matching grant. In 1750, he lobbied the Pennsylvania Assembly to create the first government matching grant—for his favorite project, the Pennsylvania Hospi- tal. Assemblymen agreed to appropr iate 2,000 pounds if Franklin's volunteers could raise 2,000 pounds.\" As Franklin wrote in his auto biography: \"... the members [of the Assembly] now conceived they might have the credit of being charitable without the expense .. . and then, soliciting subscrip- tions among the people, urg'd the conditional promise of the law as an additional motive to give, since every man's donation would be doubled: thus the clause work'd both ways.\""},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"142    L AYING THE F OUNDATION CHECK IT OUT: Many excellent resources can help you identify sources of corpor ate, government, and founda- tion grants.

DIRECT MAIL Direct mail involves sending a le tter and some supporting mate- rials directly to members, potential members, or donors to ask them to join or to make a contribution. Because of the printing, as- sembling, mailing list rentals, and postage costs involved, the pro- cess is an expensive one that is not usually affordable for start-up organizations or for those that depend on low dues or few or no dues-paying members for support. A direct mail \"test\"—an initial mailing conducted to determine how much money you can expect to raise if you mount a complete direct mail program—could cost tens of thousands of dollars, depending on how complicated the \"package\" is (see pages 146 an d 147) and how many people you mail it to. Even if you can afford it, direct mail may not be an appropriate fund-raising technique for your group if you have little name rec- ognition, are trying to raise money for an issue few people care about, have no track record solving the problems you claim in your letter to be trying to fix, or are competing with other, better known groups that are providing essentially the same services or benefits"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"FUND- RAISING 143 as you are. More to the point, ask Kay Partney Lautman and Henry Goldstein in their thorough direct mail manual Dear Friend: Mas- tering the Art of Direct Mail Fundraising (The Taft Group, 1991), can your organization financially survive a loss of 40 percent or more of its investment should the test mailing fail to recoup what it cost? And can you wait two to four years before realizing \"spendable net income\" from the mailing? If not, direct mail is probably not an option for you. Financial Considerations Several factors contribute to the cost of direct mail. Designing and printing the direct mail pack age, renting mailing lists, and postage will run into the thousands of dollars even for a modest mailing. If you do business with a direct mail consulting firm, the firm may be willing to advance you th e expenses of producing and mailing your direct mail package in anticipation of the money the package will generate in return. If you're trying to get a direct mail program off the ground yourself, you'll have to bear the burden of those expenses \"up front.\" Either way, the venture will cost you money. The trick to direct mail is to develop a compelling p ackage and mail it to a responsive list of people, who will ev entually, as they give subsequent gifts to your organization, generate more income than it cost you to send out the package in the first place. Before you launch a direct mail program consult with other or- ganizations of similar size who ha ve either foregone or opted for this fund-raising approach. Talk with experienced direct mail con- sultants who will give you good adv ice whether they get your busi- ness or not. Realize that you can increase th e amount of money you receive from first-time donors by carefully picking the people to whom you mail, and by mailing to fewer people at one time. Mailing to donors around the same time each year, mailing more than once, and following up with phone calls or letters to thank do- nors for their contributions will also help boost the size of the gift. But even in a successful campaign, don't expect more than .75 per- cent of those you mailed to in the first mailing to respond. Of those, 40 to 50 percent will give again, and of those, 75 percent will give when asked three times or more. But if you can't afford to get that first mailing off the ground, the rest of these numbers will be meaningless."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"144 L AYING THE F OUNDATION The Direct Mail Package Once you are comfortable with the budget projections, you can turn your attention to developing the kind of direct mail package that will generate the most income for your group. No one knows for sure exactly what people re ad; most direct mail packages con- lain the following elements: • An envelope. Many professional fund-raisers believe that the envelope is the most important part of the direct mail pack- age. With the onslaught of ma il people receive every day. your package must be interest ing enough at first glance to make the recipient not only open it but read on. A catchy headline or slogan, the promise of a gift inside, the opportu- nity to fill out a survey, comp lete a questionnaire, or sign a petition are all gimmicks that fu nd-raisers have used success- fully to get readers to open their mail. While the most persuasive e nvelopes are those that are hand-addressed to make you fe el lik e you're getting a letter from a friend, most organizations don't have the time to ad- dress their letters by hand, especi ally if the mail is being sent to thousands or tens of thou sands of people. More com- monly, letters will be sent in a standard-size envelope (called a \"number 10\" envelope). Many envelopes have windows in them, so that you can read the addressee's name and address, which have been prin ted on the letterhead or on the reply form, through the window. This saves time and money in printing the name and address twice. Make sure you obtain the right direct mail permits from the post office, including a \"b usiness reply\" permit for the reply envelope, and a bulk-rate permit for the outer enve- lope. If you cannot obtain a nonprofit organization permit imprint, at least get a regular bulk-rate permit. • The letter. Your letter to a prospective donor must look, read, and feel like a \"real\" letter—like correspondence you might be sending to a close fri end. It should be printed on your organization's stationery. The tone should be very personal—\"Write the way you talk .\" many direct mail copy- writers advise. The letter should be single -spaced, double-spaced between paragraphs. And the paragraphs should be very short, con- sisting of just a few, powerful sentences each."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"FUND-RAISING 145 The length of direct mail letters varies. They're usually at least two pages, sometimes fo ur, and occasionally six to eight when sent to existing suppo rters. Many direct mail ex- perts believe that longer letters work better, not because they make a donor read every line bu t because they convey to do- nors that a message is so impo rtant, it takes a lot to commu- nicate! Good direct mail letters begin with a story or anecdote that puts the issue in perspect ive, conveying a sense of ur- gency, success, emotion, or sy mbolism. The story is usually- tied to a need your organization is lacing or a problem it is trying to solve. The appeals you make in your letter should be those you believe will resonate most wi th your audience. Are people angry over a proposed tax hike ? Fearful about the possible construction of a new nuclear power plant? Do they need someone to lobby on their beha lf for health care reform? If you know what motivates your re aders to care about your is- sue and join your organization, you 'll be able to draft a suc- cessful direct mail appeal to them. You also need to ask for an explicit amount of money. Over and over again, groups that request specific dollar amounts in their letters see th e size of the average gift they receive increase. Many letters contain a final P. S. to make one last point and tie your appeal to a current event or issue. • Enclosures. It has become common practice to enclose an additional note or \"buck slip\" to give your letter extra em- phasis and appeal. Wildlife groups may enclose nature stamps. The Whitman-Walker Clinic, a Washington. DC, AIDS facility, encloses Christmas cards, unsolicited, with its end-of-the-year solicitation. Other groups include a window decal, membership card, bumper sticker, pers onal notes from celebrities, fact sheets, phot ographs, surveys or question- naires that need to be returned to the group (along with your check), and copies of f avorable news clippings. Of all these potentia l items, some are more effective in boosting donations than others .

Surveys or questionnaires are far less successful in gener- ating revenue, says Leveen, unless they are closely tied to a controversial issue (for exampl e, asking potential donors to fill out a general survey on the environment probably won't raise a lot of money; asking them to return a postcard you can then deliver to their memb er of Congress requesting sup- port of upcoming legislation on clean air probably will). Urging people to complete a survey or questionnaire for a specific reason is also more effective because it makes do- nors feel like they're taking part in your work, not just pay- ing you to do the work for them. Be very clear in all your di rect mail that the greeting cards, bumper stickers, window decals, and other items you're offering are free to the recipient. Don't leave people with the impression that they owe you money for items they didn't order. Finally, there is also a reply card that allows for your name and address and a box in which you check off how much money you are enclosing. It is usually recommended that recipients send checks or money orders, not direct cash. • The return envelope. In addition to the letter and buck slip, your direct mail package should include a \"business reply envelope,\" or BRE, in which to return the donation. The most common BRE is a wallet-flap envelope that incorpo- rates the information usually found on the reply form (in- cluding a short statement about the group, a place for the donor's name and address, and a box for the amount of the contribution). Usually, BREs are post-paid to create an added incentive to the recipient to make a contribution.

Both should be availabl e from your local post office. Mailing Lists As you prepare your package, think about whom you're going to mail it to. There are two kinds of lists: the \"house\" list, consist- ing of past contributors to or supporters of your group; and a ''prospect\" list, composed of people who have never made a con- tribution to your group before. You' ll need to write completely dif- ferent letters to the two groups . Previous donors should learn how their past donations have been put to good use, and why their help is needed again. Prospective donors need to be convinced that your group will help resolve a problem the donor cares about. Renting or exchanging/trading mailing lists is big business; they cost, on average, $65 to $70 per thousand names if you must rent the list. If you're prospecting, choose lists that you have some rea- son to believe will perform well fo r you. Mailing to a list of people who have already shown great inter est in your issue is one way; exchanging or renting lists from an organization with goals and ob- jectives similar to yours is another. Usually, you will rent another group's list for one-time use only; if you exchange your list with another group, it will be on a name-for-name basis. It is not stan- dard procedure to buy lists you can use forever; few groups are willing to sell their names fo r indefinite access by another group. Maintaining your house list is cr itical. Use a computer to keep it up-to-date, noting how many times each donor gives, how much each gives, and the appeals that generate the most amount of money. Weed out past donors who have not contributed for a given period of time by mailing to them one last time with a \"WHYFU?\" letter (why have you forsaken us?), asking why they've lapsed, explaining current activities, and suggesting they renew.

If they send you nothing, put aside their names for a prospecting letter in the future. Keep donors on your house list informed about your activities through newsletters, annual reports , personal letters to larger con- tributors, and thank-you letters to all donors. Mail several times a year, and keep track of the size of the donor's average gift, your income per thousand pieces mailed, your percentage of return, and your net income. Testing Before you incur the expense of printing an entire prospecting package and mailing it to people you don't know, test the package to determine how effective it's go ing to be. Choose a random sam- ple of names from the mailing list. Test several different variables, such as different enclosures or two versions of the outside envel- ope. One of the packages will outpe rform the other; that's the one you should go with. Mail the test package to about 10 to 15 percent of the list. Then monitor your returns for three to four weeks. If you break even, continue the process. Mailing to a list of prospects should have a return of approximately .75 perc ent; mailing to past contributors should bring in 40 to 50 percent. Evaluating Results Chances are, you won't make en ough money to cover your costs on the initial direct mail package. But this may not be all bad. Many groups feel they can afford to break even or lose money ini- tially if they'll make money re newing members later on. Don't necessarily base your success on how much money you raise in any one mailing. Rather, success may be determined by how you utilize the contributors from each previous mailing to bring in con- sistent, predictable, and substantia l funds. For example, mailing to a list of fifty thousand prospect ive donors may cost $5,000 and bring in only $5,000 from a total of five hundred contributors. But that same list could generate as much as $10,000 over the next two-year period. Most fund-raisers would consider that a success.

When I was a kid, I used to replenish the coffers of my church youth group by selling candy to everyone in the neighborhood. Bob Forney. Schuylkill County's fund-raising \"gopher,\" raised $500 by knock- ing on his neighbors' doors and asking for support to send two Committee for a Healthy Environment volunteers to a conference on hazardous wastes in Washington, DC. Raising money through door-knock ing is cheap (since the labor is usually donated by volunteers), effective (it's harder to say no to someone who's looking you in the eye), and empowering (it feels great to take a purse full of mone y back to the organization and be able to say, \"I did this\"). On the other hand, canvassing is extremely time-consuming, and it can be equally frustrating if, no matter how persuasive your plea, people just don't want to give. Before launching a canvass, carefully weigh the pros and cons. (For tips on how to set up a ca nvass, see Chapter 4, \"Building Your Organization.\") HOUSE MEETINGS A growing number of organizations are using house meetings as fund-raisers. Suppose you have deci ded to host a meeting in your home. First, invite ten or more people to stop by for light refresh- ments and to learn more about your organization. Offer back- ground information—a fact sheet you've developed, a recent news story about the issue, an endorse ment letter from another respected organization or individual in your community. If you have a video- tape (even a tape you made yourse lf), show it to make the issue more real to your guests. Have along an \"expert\" who can answer any questions your guests may have. Your program should last about half an hour. As it concludes, ask people to join or donate. (It might help to \"prime the pump\" by inviting a volunteer who says he has decided to join and urges others to do so as well.) Reiterate the importance of joining, and thank everyone for participating. To follow up, send a welcome note to all new members, and anot her recruiting appeal to all those who did not join.

Here's how it works. At least two people are needed to coordinate the entire auction. They pick a date, find a location, amass a small army of volunteers to help collect the items that will be auctioned, and set the param- eters for what will be donated and sold.

( I f something is unusually rare or special you may want to establish an opening bid on the card; the bidding must then start at that amount.) The next person to come along has the option of upping the ante on the item or moving on. After a certain time that is prominently posted, no more bids will be accepted.

There's almost no l i m i t to the var iety of products you can sell. Books, calendars, clothi ng, cookies, fruits, nu ts, candy, taffy ap- ples, flashlights, water bottles, vacations, bicycles, and even appli- ances are among the goods groups have peddled in an effort to make a buck. Particularly popular are the thousa nds of \"specialty\" items avail- able for imprinting with an organi zation's name and logo. T-shirts, coffee cups, back packs, bumper stickers, and fountain pens are just some of the products organizations have slapped their name on to boost their income (and generate some additional visibility for themselves). But there's more to setting up a merchandising operation than perhaps meets the eye. First, you must decide what to sell. Many groups choose items that will appe al to their most likely custom- ers, their members. T-shirts and baseball caps bearing an organiza- tion's logo and name, bumper stic kers brandishing the group's slogan, and buttons that capture the essence of a campaign arc popular both because they raise mone y and because they build sol- idarity among the members of a gr oup. Schools, churches, musical groups, and civic associations fre quently sell candy, cookies, nuts, and fruit, particularly during holiday fund-raising drives, when consumers are either looking for gi fts or are in a \"holiday mood.\" As a general rule of thumb, ch oose items for which you believe there will be substantial dema nd and on which you can make a profit. You can strike the best barg ains by dealing directly with the manufacturers of the items you wa nt. Check labels of products you want to sell or speak with othe r groups who are selling similar items to locate the name and address of the manufacturers you want to approach. Send the manuf acturer a letter introducing your group and asking for a price list th at tells you how much the items cost. Then negotiate with the manu facturer for the quantities of the items you wish to orde r, how you will pay for them (for example, cash in advance, or payment upon sales), and how you want the items customized. If you can't locate the manufactur ers, seek out an \"advertising specialise a middleman who help groups buy merchandise from"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"154 L AYING THE F OUNDATION the manufacturer and customize it with the group's name, logo, or other imprint. (For example, an ad specialist might help a group in- terested in organizational T-shir ts buy plain T-shirts, design camera-ready artwork, and then get the shirts imprinted.) Advertis- ing specialists are usually familiar with the variety of products that are available and know what prices are competitive. If they have pre-existing relationships with ma nufacturers or printers, they might be able to help the group get the product at a more reason- able rate. What can you sell? Here are some examples: Buttons Books (especially Bumper-stickers cookbooks) T-shirts Reports Calendars Water bottles Posters Mugs or cups Trees Games Candy, dried fruits, Tools fresh fruit, baked Magazine subscriptions goods Vacations Holiday crafts Flowers Wrapping paper Appliances How are you going to sell your merchandise? Approach your membership at meetings and through your newsletter. To sell to others in your community, you can go door-to-door or set up sales tables at fairs or at meetings of school or church groups. You can also approach local retail outlets, appealing to their community spirit to stock your goods and he lp you raise funds through sales so you don't have to ask them for a direct donation! Before you set up any kind of sa les or merchandising operation, work with your accountant to create a system to allow you to track your expenses and income and main tain an accurate inventory of the products you've bought and sold . You may need to establish a volunteer committee to handle orders, recruit and train your sales force, and collect money.

Our Bodies, Our Selves It was 1969. Twelve women from Boston's Emmanuel College were attending a workshop on women's health. Wishing to continue the discussions, the women met weekly in an office on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology campus, where several had husbands in graduate school. Their origin al goal was to compile a list of \"good\" doctors for women. But after sharing more horror stories than favorable reports, the women realized that doctors who were informed about women's health needs were hard, if not impossible, to come by. All agreed that they would benefit from a solid research effort on topics such as contraception, pregnancy, and sexually transmitted diseases. Each woman gathered information on a particular topic, then shared it with the group. One by one, they were struck by the gaping hole in medical research con- cerning women's issues, and by the lack of published information for women seeking answers to everyday health questions. Forming a \"collective\" group in which they continued their research and discussion, the women compiled their findings into a document they titled \"Women and Their Bodies: A Course.\" The fledgling New England Free Press printed this brief report on newsprint and stapled it together, the stark title handwritten on the cover. Almost overnight, the Free Press was swamped with calls for the book (even though not a cent was spent on advertising), which at $.75 a copy was a real bargain. Women were hungry for health and medical information written by women rather than by the seemingly unsympathetic, male-dominated health car e industry. The document sold an amazing 250,000 copies between 1969 and 1971."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"F UND - RAISING 157 One of the earliest versions of Our Bod- ies, Our Selves, containing invaluable women s health information, diagrams, and photos.

Our Selves and Our Children came out in 1978. and The New Our Bodies, Our Selves appeared in 1985. The collective is constantly working to make its research available to as many people as possible. It maintains the Women's Health Information Center, the largest library of women's h ealth care information in the United States, and fields inquiries from women all over the world. It started \"HealthRight,\" a national newsletter on women's health; founded Community Works, a grass roots fund-raising organization in Boston; and has spon- sored conferences and made films. The group's innova- tion and persistence in overcoming bureaucratic red tape were apparent when it established a health center at a women's prison in Framingham, Massachusetts. In their own self-help tradition, the women of the collective do their own financial planning and book- keeping for their annual operating budget of around $200,000. Revenue still comes largely from book sales, but the collective has appr oached and received funding from several foundations, and the state of Massachusetts helped fund the prison health center. The collective mails a fund-raising letter annually, typically with a solid 10 percent return, receives other donations, and has begun investing in stocks to help batten down its fi- nancial future. ORGANIZING A MARATHON You can raise substantial levels of funds for your group by or- ganizing a marathon activity that allows donors to pledge a certain amount of money on a per-unit basis. (The \"unit\" may be a mile walked, a lap swum, an hour danced, and so on.) Volunteers line up sponsors before the event; contributions fulfilling the pledges are collected after the event is over. Marathon events are appealing b ecause they requ ire very little money up front to be successful. They allow everyone in the orga- nization to participate and make a contribution; they also help build visibility for your group in the community. Walk-a-thons, bike-a-thons, and dance-a-thons are common, with volunteers getting donors to c ontribute a certain amount of money—usually less than a dollar— for every mile they cover or"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"FUND-RAISING 159 hour they spend.

Try to choose a date that can become an annual event. Consider weathe r if you're planning an outside function, and set rain dates if necessary. Contact your mayor's office for information about conflicting events. Usually, Satur- days, Sundays, and holidays of fer good opportunities to hold events like these because you get so many people who would probably be at work if you atte mpted to schedule the event on a business day. • Select a location or route that is centrally located, easily accessible, well-known, and near adequate parking facilities. A route for a walk-a-thon should be fifteen to twenty miles long; for a bicycle ride, around forty miles. Choose a safe route; avoid narrow streets with heavy traf fic or routes with left turns, especially at dangerous or busy intersections. Walk, drive, or bike the route yourself before making it official to insure that it is easy and safe. The route should also pass by parks, school grounds, or other open spaces with public facilities, or business establishments like gas stations that may give permission for marchers to use rest rooms. End where the route began so those who have driven will be near their automobiles; send a copy of the route and date to the local police department in advance so that you can obtain any permits you need. • Line up volunteers who can help recruit people to partic- ipate, coordinate the pledges, and collect the money. You'll have to develop sponsor sheets so that volunteers can write in the name and address of their sponsors on standardized forms. If prizes are to be awarded, describe them on the sheet to pro- vide added incentive to raise money, including background in- formation about your group as well."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"160 L AYING THE F OUNDATION How to Organize a Marathon (cont.) • Publicize the event to the local media. Try to line up a local TV or radio station to co-sponsor the event with you. A radio station can broadcast live from the event and increase participation. • Solicit donors who care ab out the issue or are inter- ested in protecting the community. Ask them to pledge a min- imum amount per mile or per unit. Also target local businesses. Rather than get them to pledge a minimum, ask them for a set amount; perhaps, in exchange fo r a high contribution, the spon- sor will receive a substantia l amount of publicity. Encourage each business to buy an ad in the program to be used at the awards ceremony. Prices can vary depending on the size of the ad and location in the program. • On the day of the event, ma ke sure you have enough volunteers. They should be recruited from the ranks of your own membership as well as fro m churches, civic groups, and other community-minded institutions. • To ease registration, provide at least five tables per thousand walkers expected. Space them widely and offer check-in alphabetically so that walkers can register efficiently. • Establish checkpoints every mile or two along the route (every five mile s for a bike-a-thon). Open spaces with public facilities—like parks and school grounds—make the best checkpoints, though ga s stations work well also. Staff with at least two volunteers. Stamp all ca rds to verify mileage. Provide water, foot powder, and mi scellaneous refreshments. Be sure checkpoint vo lunteers have acce ss to a phone and a list of emergency p hone numbers. Mark well with large signs and posters. Provide vehi cles for those who are unable to complete the entire course. Vehicles should travel the route continuously, picking up the dropouts and return ing them to the final/starting checkpoint. Arrange for a doctor an d nurses to be present. Have a cleanup crew dismount check-in tables and clean up all litter. Finally, don't forget to collect the pledges. You can either ask participants to collect the pledges from their sponsor or bill each sponsor directly, in which case you'll need to send a letter and bill with a business reply envelope."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"F UND - RAISING 161 How to Organize a Marathon (cont.)

WORKPLACE FUND-RAISING Every year, one small but sign ificant action—taken by thou- sands and thousands of people—ra ises hundreds of millions of dollars for importan t social causes. The action is payroll deduction, a technique most commonly as- sociated with United Way and adop ted by hundreds of other social service, human welfare, and e nvironmental agencies to encourage employees to donate a small porti on of their paychecks to worth- while efforts. The strategy is brilliant in its si mplicity. On an annual basis, a company allows its employees to de signate as much money as they wish to be deducted from their pay checks (after taxes) and donated to a charity that is participating in the company's workplace cam- paign. In most cases, the charity will ha ve had to meet certain criteria to be allowed into the campaign. In addition to being a 501(c)(3) organization, it may need to keep fund-raising and administrative costs below 25 percent of total su pport and revenue; may need to be audited annually in accordan ce with generally accepted ac- counting principles by an independent certifie d public accountant; and may need to have been in existence for a certain period of time prior to being accepted in to the workplace campaign. Organizations and institutions that belong to United Way enjoy the lion's share of workplace don ations, but getting your organiza- tion accepted into the United Way fold can be tough if your work doesn't fall under the strictly '' health and human se rvices\" rubric around which United Way is organized. However, more and more organi zations are forming independent federations to petition companies to expand their workplaces and allow new charities into their workplace campaign program.

Charter members of the Council of Federations include the Combined Health Appeal of America. Earth Share.

JOINT VENTURES In addition to asking companies for grants and employee contri- butions, many nonprofits tap corpor ate marketing departments, de- veloping joint ventures that create substantial benefits for the organization as well as the company."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"F UND - RAISING 163 One of the best known corporate/nonprofit ventures blossomed in 1984, when American Expre ss collaborated with the nonprofit group managing the restoration of the Statue of Liberty to raise $1.7 million. The alliance was the very model of simplicity and in- genuity: During a period of thr ee months, American Express do- nated $1 of every item purchased with an American Express card, and $5 from each new card application, to the statue's restoration fund. The fund got to keep the m oney, and American Express got to reap the marketing benefits when new card applications rose 17 percent and usage of the card itself increased by 28 percent. As the American Express exampl e proved, corporations profit from relationships with nonprofits in ways that money alone can't buy. Affiliating with a nonprofit give s the corporation instant cred- ibility and access to a group of c onsumers it might never reach on its own. And joining forces with a citizens organization helps a company generate favorable publicity for itself and build a positive image in the community. Nonprofits benefit from participa ting in joint ventures, too. Apart from the obvious opportunity to earn additional income, working with a corporation can increase the credibility of the orga- nization among other companies (which may lead to other partner- ships), give the group more clout in the political arena, and generate visibility for the group that will boost its membership re- cruitment efforts. In their excellent book Doing Best by Doi ng Good: How to Use Public-Purpose Partnerships to Boost Corporate Profits and Ben- efit Your Community (Dutton, 1992), Dr. Richard Steckel and Robin Simons describe several forms a joint venture can take: • Cause-related marketing links the benefit to the organiza- tion directly to the sale of the company's product or service (for example, a bicycle equipm ent manufacturer might agree to donate a dollar to a bicycle club for every water bottle it sells). • Sponsorships, particularly of fund-raising and educational events, help raise visibility for the sponsor while giving an organization the financial or pr omotional backing it needs to get the event off the ground (in Washington, DC. local radio stations take turns sponsoring annual fund-raising marathons for various health charities)."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"164 L AYING THE F OUNDATION • Premiums allow corporations to develop new products or adapt old ones whose sale will e ither generate income for a group directly or, if given aw ay for \"free,\" will encourage the recipient to become a member of or contributor to an or- ganization. (When Dr. Steckel was helping to pull the Den- ver Children's Museum out of a big financial hole, he worked with StarKist/9-Lives to develop an educational booklet about pets. Sixty-two thousand copies of the booklet—whose cover included the 9-Lives trademark and whose foreword was written by the company's CEO—were then sold to StarKist for $1. 25 each, and the company dis- tributed the premium to families and veterinarians around the country. The museum pocketed a profit, while StarKist es- tablished credibility with pet doctors and consumers.) • Licensing gives groups the opportunity to rent their name or logo to a company to apply to a product, in the hopes that such a ploy will boost product sales (hence the intense com- petition for the Olympics logo). • In-kind donations can include printing, postage, paper ac- cess to equipment, the equipmen t itself, and a wide variety of services. How do you go about creating a joint venture with a company? Vanguard Communications faced exactly that question several years ago when American Forests (AF), a nonprofit group based in Washington, DC, asked us to help identify potential corporate part- ners for a variety of the group's tree-planting activities. Here's what we did: • Targeted companies. We generated an initial list of compa- nies we felt would be interested in trees and tree planting. These included paper manufactu rers, automobile manufactur- ers, oil companies, restaurant chains, and other corporations with an interest in the environment. • Identified individuals at the companies. Using several ref- erence books available in libraries, we located the headquar- ters of each company and identified the name of the individual in charge of marketing and promotion (sometimes that person is a vice president, other times a director or man- ager of marketing and/or promot ion or public affairs: the title will depend on the company)."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"F UND - RAISING 165 • Wrote letters.

After mailing the packets to our list of targeted individuals, we fo llowed up each letter with a personal telephone call to make sure that the packet had been received and opened, and to gauge the interest of the recip- ient. • Set up appointments. We then set up meetings for the Global ReLeaf staff to go in an d meet with representatives of several of the companies to begin to talk about the kinds of collaborations that could occu r. Global ReLeaf staff re- mained flexible; some companie s were interested in premi- ums, others in caus e-related marketing. • Agreed on some potential areas of collaboration. If, after reviewing its options intern ally, a company decided to go forward, Global ReLeaf sta ff secured commitments for col- laborations and began to close the deal. • Did not let the agreement slip through the cracks.

PLANNED GIVING If your donor list includes repeat givers or wealthy prospects who are nearing estate-planning age, your fund-raisers should con- sider asking them to participat e in a planned-giving campaign. Planned gifts (formerly known as deferred gifts) are donations of money, property, or stock that people give using special tax- advantaged techniques like setti ng up trusts through their wills. Donors receive tax benefits and th e security of knowing these des- ignated assets will accrue to their favorite charities when they die. Charities are then able to borrow a nd plan based on the significant gift they will receive in the future. But before you establish a planne d-giving program, take a hard look at your group's future. Will yo u be operating, not just ten years hence, but fifty or even one hundred years from now? Your board or fund-raising committee mu st be prepared to convince your legal and financial advisors as well as your prospective do- nors that your organization intends to endure and merits such sup- port.

Once you have decided that your group has staying power, the types of planned gifts fund-raiser s can offer to established donors are numerous. Bequests are the most popular option. Through a will, a person can leave an exact dollar amount, sh ares of stock, or even an entire estate to a charitable [501(c)(3 )] nonprofit group. Donors benefit by making a major gift and by reduc ing any estate tax burden that may eventually befall their heirs. Organizations then dispose of the assets and receive the money (heed ing any restrictions the donor set on how the assets are to be used). Gift annuities, which are financial contracts written by a non- profit, generate revenue back to the donor an d beneficiaries until the death of the last beneficiar y, when the donated funds become the sole property of the nonprofit to us e for its purposes. Charitable trusts receive contributions of ca sh, stocks, or property essentially in trust for the charity wh ile generating fixed- or variable- interest income for the donor. Th e contribution, which provides a federal income tax deduction for the donor in the year the gift is made, may be made for life or a limited period of years. When the trust ends, the nonprofit receives th e assets remaining in the trust. Charitable lead trusts are the opposite of ch aritable trusts: The donor's gift is used by the charit y for a period of time, after which the remainder goes back to the donor's designated beneficiary. Donors can also opt to invest thei r gift in a diversified portfolio called a pooled income fund. The fund will norm ally have many donors/investors, each of whom receives his or her share of net in- come. As individual beneficiaries die, the nonprofit managing the pooled-income fund receives the d onor/investor's share of the fund. How to Proceed Seek advice. Financial planners, lawy ers, and accountants can help you set up a plan ned-giving campaign appro priate for your or- ganization. Ask another charity that solicits planned gifts to recom- mend a firm. Your group's financ ial and legal counsel will also come in handy, as will lawyers a nd bankers retained by donors in- terested in making a pla nned gift to your group. Promote your campaign.

With such a foundation in pl ace, you should now be ready to add the \"building blocks\" that w ill allow you to pursue your goals with some reasonable chance of su ccess. These building blocks fall into three basic categories: co mmunications, lobbying, and action at the polls. Chapter 6, \"Communications,\" focuses on the myriad tactics you can use to generate favorable media coverage of your issues and then to use that coverage to pursue your organizing goals. As you'll see from the stories retold in these pages, securing publicity for an issue or a campaign is rare ly the raison d'etre of the cam- paign itself. Rather, organizers employ communications tactics to help move along other elements of their organizing strategy. Such is not necessarily the case with lobbying or action at the polls. Chapter 7, \"Lobbying,\" describes the processes you engage in to create, amend, or defeat legislation locally and nationally, while Chapter 8, \"Action at the Po lls,\" presents tactics that will help should you decide (or be for ced) to take your issue directly to the public for a vote, to elect candi dates to office, or to pursue election yourself. Both lobbying and political action may be used as tactics to pursue a specifi c goal—or may become organizing goals themselves.

Its 12,290 essential acres emanate from almost the exact center of Kansas. But despite its classification, the wetland rarely receives enough rain- fall or runoff to compensate for the amount of water that evaporates from the area. Ir onically, Cheyenne Bottoms is dry more often than wet. When the Bottoms is dry, it takes a patient naturalist to appreciate the critical role an ecosystem like this one plays in nurturing the hundreds of waterfowl species that visit each spring and fall. But. says Jan Carton, co- chair of the Save Cheyenne Bottoms Task Force and a member of the Northern Flint Hills chapter of the Na- tional Audubon Society, \"when it has water, it's an extraordinary place,\" whose value is lost on few. Rain showers can convert th e Bottoms into a lush oa- sis, reviving the heart of the great American plains. Vistas of calm water, bordered by long marsh grasses and cattails that sway to the reedy whistles of red-winged blackbirds, stretch on for miles. Both th e water and shore teem with wildlife: turtles, muskrat, de er, even a rattlesnake or two. And everywhere, birds, arriving in stages Nature has spent eons timing: ducks, geese, and cranes in early spring; sandpipers, plovers, and other shorebirds in April and May; blackbirds and orioles in the summertime. The entire area plays a vital role in the Central Flyway system, the chain of wetlands that provides rest and re- fueling stops for birds migr ating from the northernmost reaches of Canada to the tip of South America. In the spring, 45 percent of all U.S. shorebirds can be found at the Bottoms, and five species of shorebirds send 90 per- cent of their population through the welcoming Kansas marsh. According to International Shorebird Surveys, Cheyenne Bottoms is the single most important migratory area in the United States, a nd may be the most important migration stopover in the entire Western Hemisphere."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"C OMMUNICATIONS 177 What makes the Bottoms so important, Garton says, is the birds' migratory habits. ''A lot of these shorebirds fly until their energy runs out, a few thousand miles. If Chey- enne Bottoms is not there for them to stop and 'refuel,' they're in trouble.\" With wetlan ds disappearing at the alarm- ing rate of nearly 500.000 acres annually, othe r marshy rest stops have literally dried up. Birds without the energy to keep flying and look for anot her place to feed could die. In 1957, the state of Kansas purchased Cheyenne Bottoms and tried to convert it into permanent marsh- land by diverting water from other rivers. But local irri- gation projects were literally draining the region of its water; it looked like the Bottoms was in danger of join- ing the grim statistics underlying the fact that half the wetlands in Kansas and the United States have been de- stroyed in the last two hundred years. The area needed a significant—and expensive— engineering overhaul if it was going to meet Mother Nature's needs as well as those of farmers. But consid- ering how few Kansans even knew the marsh existed, a major campaign would be needed to build support for Cheyenne Bottoms and motivate the legislature to spend money to save it. The Northern Flint Hills chapter of Audubon became involved in 1983, when Garton and other members decided someone needed to save Chey- enne Bottoms before it was too late. The group knew that task number one was publicity: Their campaign to save Chey enne Bottoms would succeed or fail depending on the amou nt of public support it en- gendered. Deciding to spend th e first year working to in- crease awareness, the activist s launched a media campaign in the fall of 1983, even befo re they sought the help of other conservation groups. A poster and brochure—tried- and-true communications basics —were designed to intro- duce as many people as possible as quickly as possible to the area and to recruit volunteers. The more unusual and creative elements of this campaign came later.

It needs your help. Speak up. Speak out. We can save Cheyenne Bottoms.\" The statewide Kansas Audubon Council covered the cost of printing five hundred of the 14-by-22-inch post- ers. Members distributed the posters, colorfully printed in hues of black, rust, and blue, through the nine local Audubon chapters in Kansas and the state's Wildlife and Parks Department. They also hung them in schools, libraries, the state university biology department, and other places that display informational material— \"Wherever there was an environmentally friendly person,\" Garton said. The following spring, members presented a framed copy of the poster to Governor John Carlin to encourage him to start considering the Bot- toms's problem and to let hi m know that efforts to pre- serve the area had crystallized. Jan Garton joins representatives from five Audubon chapters in presenting the Save Cheyenne Bottoms poster to Governor John Carlin in March 1984, six months into the campaign."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"C OMMUNICATIONS 179 Garton also created a brochu re to provide more details about the Bottoms and motivate people to join the cam- paign. The simple but organized four-panel design con- sisted of crisp line art and ty peset text with boxed quotes from authorities such as a Kansas Fish and Game biolo- gist. The simple brochure, printed in brown ink on inex- pensive yellow recycled paper, encouraged readers to help preserve the wetland by conta cting legislators, joining a conservation group, or buying federal duck stamps at the post office. Interested readers could fill out a tear-off cou- pon to return to the Save the Bottoms office (also known as Garton's home) to receiv e more information. The out- side back panel consisted of a self-mailer with a return address and the Save the Bottoms logo. If the volume of brochures printed and distributed is any indication of success, then the Bottoms piece was a real winner. When a substantial first print run of ten thousand copies (again funded by Audubon) was quickly exhausted, high interest in the area eventually warranted two more printings. Since they had not yet compiled a concrete mailing list, the Audubon activists relied on displaying the bro- chures in public places for passersby to pick up. They dropped them off at libraries and schools—outlets that, more than supermarket counters, would attract people likely to be interested in the cause. They also put copies in the Wildlife and Parks Department offices and in of- fices of environmental organizations. In a particularly insightful move, the activists contacted the state's tourist agency and sent brochures to visitors' centers on the Kansas Turnpike so people visiting the state would read about Cheyenne Bottoms and feel motivated to help. Garton said that twenty or thirty people on the Bottoms mailing list became involved because they noticed the brochure at a visitors' center, and a number of them sent money or volunteered to work. Later in the campaign, Bottoms bumper stickers and mugs were produced and given away or sold. The group also produced an attractive and inexpensive newsletter, which they used to keep coalition members and other supporters informed about the Bottoms and their efforts to protect it."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"180 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS This poster, brochure, and bumper sticker were used to educate the public about Cheyenne Bottoms."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"C OMMUNICATIONS 181 Hunters and Hikers The activists spent the winter of 1983 building the Save Cheyenne Bottoms Task Force. The most important function this coalition served was to \"unite a number of environmental and conservation groups that had never worked together in the past , and had often viewed each other as adversaries,\" Garton said. Groups with hunting interests, for example, usually clash with Audubon and other wildlife preservation organizations, but these dif- ferences were transcended in the interest of conserving the Bottoms. \"There were some rivalries, jealousies, suspicions. We got to know each other, got to unite around a cause,\" she said. Eight groups joined forces, including the Kansas chapters of the Audubon Council, Ducks Unlimited, the Ornithological Society, the Na- tional Wildlife Federation, the Natural Resources Coun- cil, the Sierra Club, the American Fisheries Society, and the Wildlife Society. They set two goals: to preserve a natural wildlife habitat, and to maintain the economic benefits surrounding communities derived from recrea- tional and sporting us e of the Bottoms. Coalition members began writing to their state legis- lators that winter. Though they did not yet have a specific proposal or bill drafted, they wanted to lose no time in educating their target audience. \"We weren't telling them to do this or that about it, we were just say- ing please help save the area,\" remembers Garton. Be- lieving that a concentrated, broad-based educational effort would effectively inform legislators and mobilize the public, activists began planning a Saving Cheyenne Bottoms conference to be held in September 1984. The Opening Pitch Garton took charge of publicizing the conference. She secured lists of all the daily and weekly newspapers in the state via the reference section in her local library and the West Central Regi onal Audubon office in her hometown of Manhattan. Kansas. Hoping to boost at- tendance from the public and the media by getting re- porters to feature the Bottoms before the conference occurred, she wrote a press release that, in one of the campaign's largest mailing efforts, she and her fellow"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"182 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS task force members sent to ev ery paper in the state. The results were stunning. During the week prior to the conference, newspapers and even a Wichita television station filed stories about Cheyenne Bottoms and adver- tised the event. Seven or ei ght reporters attended the conference and wrote stories, and another TV station and the Kansas affiliate of National Public Radio toured the Bottoms and ran stories. Environmental and other interest groups were contacted about the conference and encouraged to attend as well. However they heard about it, two hundred people showed up at the two-day gathering at a community col- lege near Cheyenne Bottoms to witness firsthand the dry, cracked mud floor of the marsh and to listen to the eerie silence—there were no birds. No more compelling evidence was needed to convince conference attendees that the marsh needed help. State wildlife officials who were involved in managing the Bottoms discussed the increasing conflict over how the region's water re- sources should be used, while wildlife groups described the area's unique ecology. Each speech went into a booklet that was given out to registrants as well as to re- porters to make their reporting job easier and, it was hoped, yield more comprehensive, accurate stories. Focusing the Campaign Ironically, the sophisticated water management informa- tion presented at the conf erence convinced the task force that it needed even more facts about the Bottoms. A professional study of the area and its inadequacies, along with suggestions for renovations, was essential if any progress was to be made. Securing state funding for this study—in a state wh ere public money had never been used to preserve wild life—became the crux of the Save Cheyenne Bottoms Task Force's battle for the next two years, and the basis for a stepped-up publicity cam- paign. Now was the time to nurture press contacts. The ed- itorial writer at the Eagle-Beacon in Wichita, one of the state's major papers, was sympathetic to the cause, so the task force sent press relea ses and fact sheets to him regularly and could usually co unt on an editorial. In ad-"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"C OMMUNICATIONS dition to the newspaper lists, Garton maintained a list of contacts at the state capitol and a list of \"unique\" outlets such as National Public Radio. A writer for one news service whose work ran in several state papers saw the press release, attended the c onference, continued to call Garton for information, and wrote several stories. Garton described screening his stories to decide if he was in fact a supporter, and then sharing information regularly with him once she decided he was. \"We learned to be cautious. You do n't tell people your strat- egy, you play just like a politician. Don't tell the media what you really think; save your feelings for your inner group.\" she said. The key, she summarized simply, is never to say anything you don' t want to see in the pa- per. A Pillow Fight In February 1985, the activists had a brainstorm: Why not present Save Cheyenne Bottoms seat cushions to the state lawmakers they were lobbying for the study money? The media event woul d give reporters a highly photogenic opportunity to cover the campaign, allow ac- tivists to interact on a personal level with their legisla- tors, and give the legislators something to smile about. As it happened, the Denver Broncos football team had canceled an order with a local vendor for orange sta- dium cushions before the cushions were printed, so the vendor happily unloaded them on the task force at a sig- nificant discount. Though it was not the color of choice, orange was so bright and notic eable that it proved to be a terrific background for the Save the Bottoms logo and graphic—a bird rising from a marsh. The cost of pur- chase and printing was covered in part by the cushion sponsor program: Bottoms supporters were encouraged via the group's newsletter and word of mouth to spend a minimal $3 and sponsor a cushion that they could present to their legislator in person. Out of 165 legisla- tors. 60 to 70 were handed a cushion by one of their constituents; the task force sponsored the rest. While Garton coordinated media outreach, a volun- teer phoned each legislator and set up a time to deliver the cushion. Garton mailed a press release to reporters"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"184 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS who covered the state legislature announcing the presen- tation and accompanying pre ss conference. On Febru- ary 12, the activists gathered at the capitol and gave their respective policymakers their pillows—telling them: \"We'll save your bottoms if you save ours!\" Vol- unteers then met with each legislator to discuss the im- portance of funding the proposed study. The group was rewarded with highly favorable newspaper coverage, stories on two local TV stations, and several radio inter- views. In another strategic media move, Garton requested and was granted a half hour interview on a Kansas radio station that received good statewide coverage. The show's agricultural focus attracted many farmers who, in need of the Bottoms's water for irrigation, opposed renovating the wetland. \"It targeted an audience we wouldn't have had a chance to contact otherwise,\" Garton explained. \"They need ed to know our view of the issue.\" Getting the Word into the Streets Though few Kansans seemed to oppose preserving the wetland, it still took the Save Cheyenne Bottoms Task Force a year and a half to convince the state legislature that the area was worth any expenditure—let alone the $200,000 it was projected to cost. When a bill to fund what amounted to only a por tion of the study passed in the spring 1985 legislative session, the group had to mo- bilize again in 1986 to squeeze even more money out of the government to finish the study. The now-seasoned band of advocates hit on another clever idea. To put more pressure on legislators and give the entire cam- paign a \"shot in the arm,\" they needed a single event that would reach millions of people in towns across the state. Why not organize a two-hundred-mile relay run from Cheyenne Bottoms to the capitol using a vial of Bottoms water as a baton? On March 22. 1986, the first runner and supporters gathered at the Bottoms for the starting gun. Each of the forty-five participants ran between one and ten miles be- fore handing the vial off to the next runner. Two hun- dred miles, three days, and many tired feet later, the"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"C OMMUNICATIONS final runner sprinted up the capitol steps and presented the vial of water to Governor Carlin. Like the cushions, the run was timed to precede the spring legislative ses- sion, so members of the coalition presented each legis- lator with his or her own small brown jug of Bottoms water and again met with them to urge their approval of funds to complete the study. The task force held another press conference at the capitol shortly after the race was finished. They had sent press releases to the capitol reporters and to media in the towns along the run's route, and response was tre- mendous, with local papers printing photos of their townspeople jogging alongside the designated runner. \"It gave people a chance to show that they were sup- porters, building a network of activists working to- gether,\" said Garton. The event generated a chain of coverage that followed the race across the state to To- peka, where the larger city media took over. At the end of the spring 1986 legislative session, the Kansas state legislature approved Governor John Car- lin's recommendation that $60, 000 be allocated to com- plete the Cheyenne Bottoms feasibility study. Task Force members breathed another sigh of relief the fol- lowing fall, when the study was finally completed. The untiring activists continued to keep a watchful eye on the Kansas Wildlife and Parks Department to in- sure that the study's recommendations included a com- prehensive renovation plan for the marsh. They did; following the study's recommendations, the Wildlife and Parks Department began overseeing the renovations to the marsh and the creation of additional marshland. Renovations (to compensate for lack of rainfall, as well as ongoing irrigation projects in the area) include dig- ging canals and pools to allow water to move into the marsh more freely, constructing dikes, and installing water distribution structures such as pump stations. The improvements, scheduled to be completed around 2001, will enable Cheyenne Bottoms to handle the water it re- ceives from rainfall and runoff more efficiently so that. even during drought years, wetland habitat will be avail- able for wildlife."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"186 T HE B UILDINC B LOCKS The Bottom Line The elements of this public ity campaign—poster, bro- chure, media events, bumper sticker, newsletter—were consistently deployed in a tactical way to keep the task force's overall strategy movi ng forward. Regular press contact, well-conceived press releases, and clever pub- licity hooks kept Cheyenne Bottoms in the Kansas spot- light for three years; without it, the state would not be improving Cheyenne Bottoms today. The Cheyenne Bottoms campaign left its imprint on Kansas in other important ways, too. For one. Kansans to- day are a good deal more savv y about wetlands and their importance to the region and the continent. But perhaps more important, there is now a strong, experienced envi- ronmental voice in the state that did not exist before. WHY IT WORKED Organizers of the effort to save Cheyenne Bottoms ran an im- pressive media campaign that su cceeded on three levels. It in- formed and mobilized the public, educating people about the issue and getting them to take action at th e right time. It shaped the pol- icy agenda in the state legislature, forcing lawmakers to deal with a problem they initially knew nothing a bout. And it strengthened the group itself, transforming a di sparate band of environmentalists into an effective coalition r eady to take on other fights. The campaign was able to accomplish so many challenging goals because it revolved around a well-conceived and well- implemented strategy that never lo st its focus. Here's a quick re- view of the steps you should take to develop a media strategy for your organization. Developing a Media Strategy In devising an effective communi cations strategy, ask yourself the following questions: • Does the media campaign reinforce your group's overall agenda? Your media strategy should fit hand-in-glove with"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"C OMMUNICATIONS 187 your organizing goals and objecti ves. If you have created an organizing blueprint (see Chapter 2), refer to it frequently to keep yourself focused on the point of your organizing ef- forts. If given a choice between two events or activities, choose the one that will move you most readily toward your goals. • What organizational resources can you commit to your media program? Define resources broadly—not just in terms of money, but also in terms of volunteers, staff, a newsletter or other publications you produce, computer capa- bilities, and of course, time. Th ere is no simple prescription for the percentage of resources you should devote to your or- ganization's media efforts; it will probably increase when you are staging specific media events and other labor- intensive activities, and decrease when you are primarily maintaining your program. At a minimum, communications should always be included in overall organizational strategic planning. • What time constraints do you face? Be realistic about what you actually have time to pull off. Because the Kansas leg- islature meets for only ninety days each year, the Bottoms activists had a substantial amo unt of time in between legis- lative sessions to plan their media events and build relation- ships with reporters that th ey could tap when votes on funding for their study were pending. On the other hand, be- cause so much time did lapse between legislative sessions, Jan Garton and her colleagues had to make sure their media events kept the Cheyenne Bo ttoms story alive for lawmak- ers. Use the media to get your message out at the times most critical for mobilizing volunteer s and pressuring elected offi- cials. • Are you reaching your target audiences? Obviously, the media are one target audience; you'll know if you're suc- cessfully educating reporters by the frequency with which and the way in which they cove r your stories. But you also use the media to reach other target audiences, such as legis- lators, government officials, and the public. You'll get a sense of how much support you have among legislators by"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"188 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS how they vote; among governme nt officials by how respon- sive they are to your concerns about the enforcement of laws and regulations affecting issues you care about; among the public at large by the number of people who attend events you organize, contact their electe d officials, give you money, or join your group. The Cheyenne Bottoms Media Strategy Here's how the Cheyenne Botto ms media strate gy unfolded: G OALS • To protect Cheyenne Bottoms by getting the state legislature to allocate government funds fo r a study on the disappearing wetlands. • To conduct the study and renovate the wetlands. O RGANIZATIONAL C ONCERNS • Inadequate staff and resources ; solve by building coalition to mount campaign and augment re sources available to win campaign. T ARGETS • State legislators. • Reporters. • Public at large.

T IME F RAME • Three years (until st udy was completed)."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"C OMMUNICATIONS 189 The activists modified their tact ics as the campaign evolved. For example, when they began, they had no way of knowing that it would take them two and a half ye ars to get the study completely funded, or that they would need to plan multiple media events to influence legislators and the public. Still, what never changed was their understanding of the role the media co uld play in helping them achieve their goals and obj ectives. The question was never about whether they would g enerate publicity—but how.

HOW THE MEDIA WORK \"Just by reporting it. how they report it and how they play it— emphasizing one angle over another, using it at the top of page 1 or as the lead story on the eve ning newscast—the media can help shape or crystallize or accelerate pu blic response to a story,\" wrote reporter David Shaw in \"Media Impact: Why Some Stories Have It, and Others Don't\" in the Los Angeles Times (October 26, 1992)."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"190 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS They can also bury your story so that the public never has a chance to give it a second thought. You can improve the odds that reporters will give your story the kind of coverage it deserves by understanding how reporters and edit ors decide what to cover and what to ignore. What Is Newsworthy? Your chances of getting in th e papers or on TV are greatest when your story is considered \"newsworthy.\" To most editors and reporters, this means your story has the following characteristics: • It is new. (Remember the Mothers of East L.A.? No one could remember the last time they witnessed a pack of moth- ers in white scarves marching across a bridge to oppose a prison.) • It is timely. In other words, it connects to another local, na- tional, or international story to make yours seem more rele- vant. (You will make your stor y seem more timely if you link or \"peg\" it to the release of controversial reports, an up- coming vote, or some other ev ent that you expect to garner substantial media attention—for example, the spectacular sight of thousands of birds arri ving at the marsh gave Chey- enne Bottoms supporters a wond erful publicity opportunity to focus attention on the region 's ecological significance). • It is colorful. It can be accompanied by compelling visual images, either photographs or videotape. • It involves substantial numbers of people. Stories that im- pact hundreds, thousands, or m illions of people usually get more play than those that affect just a few. • It revolves around a crisis, conflict, or catastrophe. The media thrive on other people's misfortunes—and from a reporter's point of view the mo re awful, outrageous or unbe- lievable it is, the better. • It involves controversy. For the purposes of generating me- dia coverage about an issue, it is always better to have two sides than one. Some activists have been known to suggest names of opponents reporters might interview in order to"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"C OMMUNICATIONS 191 play up the controversial elem ents of a story and enhance media opportunities. • Celebrities are participating. A \"celebrity\" can be the lat- est Hollywood hunk or starlet, a well-known politician, or the local football or basketball hero—in other words, some- one who enjoys relatively go od name recognition and has been in the news before. Celebrities add some glamour to events; they're particularly usef ul for getting access to inter- view programs. But they can also be quite independent and uncontrollable, and use your venue to deliver a message about their own agenda. Make sure the celebrities you recruit stick to your message exactly. Agree to the ground rules of their participation in advance. At the least, give them a list of talking points on paper that you want them to address. It is not unreasonable to give them a prepared statement to read, and to restrict freewheeling interviews until you're ab- solutely confident the celebrity will accurately reflect your point of view. Whether trying for broadcast or print coverage, on radio or TV. in newspapers or a magazine, keep in mind these essential ele- ments a story must contain to be considered newsworthy. If, upon reviewing your story, you don't belie ve it meets at least a third of the criteria listed above, don't wast e your time and resources trying to get reporters to cover it. Go b ack to the drawing board, recon- sider the elements you have to wo rk with, and rework your story idea until you feel you can \"pitch \" it to reporters more success- fully. Media Outlets A media outlet is the vehicle that delivers news and information to your target audience. There are many categories of media out- lets, and you need to be familiar with all of them. They include television stations, radio stations, daily and weekly newspapers, magazines, and local cable television stations. T ELEVISION Of all the media available to work with today, perhaps none has a greater impact than TV. According to the Roper organization. 65 percent of Americans identify \"the boob tube\" as their main source of news and 49 percent consider television the most believable "},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"192 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS news source. Claims the Washin gton, DC-based Benton Founda- tion, which promotes the use of me dia by public interest organiza- tions, more than 92 million U.S. households, or 98 percent of all homes, own television sets—more than those with indoor plumb- ing or telephones! Given the pervasive role television plays in providing informa- tion and shaping public opinion, its importance in positioning issues and winning a campaign can't be ignored. Even if you don't watch TV yourself, assign one or more ''media monitors\" to keep track of the quantity and quality of the media coverage you're gen- erating. Many television reporters are \"g eneral assignment\" staff—they cover any breaking news story rather than just one topic or \"beat.\" At larger TV stations, TV reporte rs will specialize in beats like consumer affairs, health or city ha ll; all stations, regardless of size, usually have one beat reporter wh o covers sports and another who does the weather. While television is more immediate—and frequent—in the de- livery of news than newspapers or magazine s, it is also much briefer. Essentially, broadcast ers compress various news events into short segments they then stri ng together to give a brief over- view of the day. The ave rage story lasts no lo nger than one minute and forty-five seconds and is ac companied by a video image; even very short newspaper stories contai n more words. Th e average half hour broadcast of evening news contains only about twenty-two minutes of actual reporting, includi ng the weather and spoils re- ports (the rest is commercials and station identification messages), providing far less information than what's offered in the entire daily paper. In TV. the visual is everything. Still, television offers activists many opportunities for cover- age. Most stations deliver news four times a day: in the early morning (sandwiched around the network morning shows like \"'Good Morning America\" and \"T he Today Show\"); at noon; in the early evening, aroun d suppertime; and then again at 10:00 or 11:00 P.M. If an important story is \"b reaking.\" newscasters may interrupt regularly scheduled programming to give viewers a news update. In addition to its news programming, a station may also offer morning talk shows, which usually air at 9:00 or 10:00 A . M . week- days, and occasionally at 7:00 or 8:00 on Satu rday or Sunday mornings. These talk s hows, which on average last half an hour, provide activists with an excellent opportunity to deliver their"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"C OMMUNICATIONS 193 message—unfiltered by reporters or editors—directly to the audi- ence (see page 254 for information on how to arrange appearances on these programs). Nearly two out of three local st ations also run editorial com- ments, either during regularly scheduled newscasts or during fea- ture programs. Activists can lob by station managers to influence the content of these editorials a nd viewers can appear on-camera to respond to an editorial or comment on an issue of public impor- tance, delivering a \"guest editorial\" the way they would write a letter to the editor of a newspaper. Some news stories are simply recounted by one of the news \"anchors.\" people who sit at a news desk and read news reports live. But because TV is a visual medium, most stories are told by a reporter who has taken a camera cr ew to the scene of the story and obtained compelling video images and interviews with the subjects involved. Though many people work at a televi sion station, you'll primar- ily be concerned with those w ho are involved in the production and delivery of the news: The news director is responsible for the overall news program and determines what beats reporters will cover as well as which particular stories they'll cover. The assignment editor helps dete rmine which stories the sta- tion will cover and assigns reporters to do the stories. The news producer is responsible for getting the story onto film or tape; the producer works w ith the reporter to select images the camera crew shoots and helps write the reporter's script. The producer also enforces deadlines to make sure a news segment gets produced in time to make it on the air. The reporter actually goes out with the camera crew, con- ducts interviews, and works with th e producer to put the story to- gether. N EWSPAPERS Newspapers report stories in much greater detail than either tele- vision or radio. On the whole, they contain more information about local issues than national ones; stories are either written by locally based staffs, \"stringers\" or free-la nce reporters, or picked up from wire services and news syndicates. There are approximately 1,600 daily newspapers published in the United States every day. with a combined circulation of 62.6"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"194 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS million readers. Most cities will ha ve at least one daily newspaper and several weekly papers, as well as an array of special-interest newspapers or newsletters. According to the National Newspaper Association, approxi- mately 63 percent of all American adults read a newspaper every weekday. The number pumps up to 68 percent on Sunday. In ad- dition, nine out of ten people read at least one paper every week. In addition to the newspapers published in English, ethnic com- munities may publish a weekly or (more infrequently) daily in their own language: Chinese. Korean, Spanish, Arabic, and so on. For example, African Americans in Washington, DC, can read the Washington Afro-American; Hispanics can peruse El Diario de la Nation; and Koreans can thumb through the Washington edition of the Hankook Illbo, published in Korea. Newspaper people are fond of saying that their news and edito- rial sections are as separate as c hurch and slate. That's because the news sections are supposed to carry unbiased reports that reflect all sides of a story, while editorial writers are allowed to express their opinions about a story. Reporters are expected to remain neutral, reporting on the details, like who was involved in an event, what the event was, why it was held, and what the opposition had to say about it. Editorial editors and writers usually take sides, making judgments based on their analysis of the impact of the story on people, their community, or country. Unless they change jobs, re- porters don't write editorials, and editorial writers don't cover sto- ries. On the editorial side of the paper, you'll want to know three people: The editorial page editor is responsible for the editorials that appear in the newspaper. Larger papers may employ several indi- viduals to write editorials: they serve on the editorial \"board.\" At smaller papers, the editorial page editor may be the person who writes all the editorials as well. Where an editorial board does ex- ist, the editorial page editor conv enes meetings of all the editorial writers to discuss potential editor ial topics and assign individual editorial writers to write a piece. There is also an editor of the op-ed page. An op-ed is a col- umn, sometimes called an opinion ed itiorial, that is written by a guest writer and expresses an opinio n on a particular topic; it usu- ally runs opposite the editorial page. And most papers have an editor of the letters to the editor"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"C OMMUNICATIONS 195 section of the paper who determines which letters to run (see pages 226 to 231 for tips on how to arra nge editorial board meetings and write and place letters to the editor and opinion editorials). Columnists are individuals who are allowed to express their point of view in a feature that the newspaper carries on a regular basis. Columnists either find their pieces on the op-ed page, facing the editorial page, or in the features section of the paper. If editorial writers and editors ar e the \"church,\" news editors are the \"state.\" Most newspapers have an editor for each section of the paper: sports, health, food, life-style, metropolitan news, na- tional news, and so on. Editors of these sections assign reporters to cover stories based on their knowledge of a particular \"beat\" (or category of news) or availability of reporters in the news- room. Beat reporters cover specific topics, such as those described above; general assignment reporters cover an array of topics from day to day, depending on ho w many different stories need to be reported upon and the availability of other reporters in the newsroom. Newspapers offer an encouraging array of opportunities for ac- tivists in need of publicity. Through letters to the editor and op-eds you can express your point of view or respond to others. Hard news reporters will cover breaking news stories, while feature re- porters and columnists will prepar e more in-depth pieces with a stronger human interest angle. Y ou may be able to \"sell\" your story to the health editor, metro desk , real estate section, city desk, and even the food writer, depending on how you \"pitch\" it. (Remember the news about alar, a pesticide used on apples? Af- ter the story became a \"60 Minutes\" sensation, different versions of it appeared in many sections of local newspapers: food sections did stories on organic produce, business writers reported on the economic impact banning the chemical would have on apple grow- ers, health editors examined the links between pesticides and can- cer, and news reporters went to supermarkets to document the effect the story had on consumers.) W EEKLY N EWSPAPERS Don't overlook weekly newspapers, which are sometimes per- ceived as \"lesser\" newspapers in the community. Many citizens read their community newspapers from cover to cover. Even when you can't get your story into the main paper, the weeklies may "},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"196 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS cover it religiously. Keep track of their deadlines, circulation, ad- vertising rates, and the conditions under which they'll accept your photos so that you can employ weeklies from the beginning to build your case. Use them particul arly to announce meetings, re- cruit members, and promote events. R ADIO According to the Radio Advertising Bureau (RAB), Americans average about three hours of radi o listening per day. Two out of three Americans listen to the radio during prime time; radio is their first source of morning news. The RAB estimates that 53 percent of the work force list ens to the radio at wo rk, and 77 percent of adults listen in their cars. Almost every city in America hosts several radio stations. All- news stations in each market sp ecialize in twenty-four-hour cover- age of local, regional, and nati onal news events. Other stations devote themselves exclusively to a certain type of music; classical, rock, funk, and country are amon g the most common. Still other stations offer a mix of news, music, and talk shows. The kind of news coverage a st ation produces is frequently a function of the station's size. Whereas large stations may attend press conferences, for example, smal ler ones without reporters to dispatch often prefer to do on-air or recorded interviews via tele- phone. Small and medium-sized sta tions might be willing to take pretaped comments (called \"actua lities\") from your group over the telephone; larger stations probably will want to conduct their own interviews. Many radio stations offer news updates once an hour, giving you more opportunities for coverage on radio than with any other medium. But remember: In addition to having a solid news story, you can increase your chances of radio play by having something that sounds terrific. Good sound effect s—like the wail of a train whistle, the chant of demonstrators, the roar of engines, or a col- orful \"quotable quote\" (a ten-to-fifteen-second phrase or sentence that sums up your position in a memorable way)—will improve your chances for radio co verage significantly. A local radio station has the fewe st number of reporters avail- able to actually go out and cover st ories. But it offers you several in-studio options for coverage: • Talk shows. Whether live or pretape d, talk shows let you de- liver your message directly to the listening audience; appear-"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"C OMMUNICATIONS 197 ances usually are scheduled thr ough the host of the program or its producer (see page 254 fo r tips on how to set up an in- terview). • Public service announcements. These outlets give you a free forum for disseminating yo ur message—if you meet cer- tain criteria (s ee page 232). • The news. Radio news is usually re ad on the air by an an- nouncer. But occasionally ann ouncers interview newsmakers live at the radio station or over the telephone. Radio can use the voice of you r spokespeople in four main ways: as an actuality, in an inte rview segment, on a talk show, or in a public service announcement . Actualities and interviews are usually produced by the news de partment, while talk shows may be scheduled through the program's host or staff, and public ser- vice announcements are arranged thr ough the public service direc- tor. An actuality is essentially a prerecorded quote from the newsmaker that is used to enhance a radio news story. It is short— between ten and twenty seconds, a nd no more than seventy-five words. It may be excerp ted from a taped inte rview, a speech, or a statement at a news conference. So me groups have gotten more so- phisticated, taping comments from their leaders on important is- sues and then calling radio stations to ask if they want to take the comment right over the telephone . (Check with audio equipment stores for the cables you need to co nnect your tape recorder to the telephone.) If you are recording an actuality for your group, make sure it conveys a complete thought. Pause between statements so that ra- dio personnel will be able to edit your comments into the news piece easily. An interview segment is basically what it says it is: an inter- view between a reporter and a sp okesperson. It can be live or taped, and if it is taped, it can be ai red in its entirety or edited into a shorter piece. Interview segment s are usually aired as part of a news program. A talk show interview can be given either in the studio or by phone. Interviews may last as little as five minutes or as long as an hour. They may be punctuated by listener call-ins, and questions may range from complicat ed to simple, from hostile to supportive."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"198 T HI B UILDING B LOCKS In addition to pursuing radio fo r news coverage and interview opportunities, many groups recruit local radio stations to broadcast live from the scene of high-visibili ty fund-raisers, demonstrations, or celebrations. Throughout the week leading up to the event, the station offers its listeners T-shirts, mugs, or other paraphernalia. And one of the station's disc jockeys emcees the happening it- self. M AGAZINES Many cities and regions of th e country now enjoy the pub- lication of a magazine specifically aimed at their geographic locale (most newspapers also publish a Sunday magazine). These magazines consist almost entirely of feature stories with high hu- man interest value and are us ually accompanied by photographs. Several other types of magazines offer activists publicity oppor- tunities as well. The national newsweekly magazines—like Time and Newsweek —and the general interest monthlies—like Good Housekeeping or Life —appeal to a mass audience and cover a wide range of topics. \"Industry\" or \"trade\" magazines cover a nar- row topic that is usually of inte rest to only a limited segment of the public (for example, the Journal of the American Medical As- sociation is a \"trade\" publication read primarily by doctors, med- ical researchers, and others i nvolved in the health industry). The magazine's senior editor functions much like a TV news director; this person is responsible for overall coverage, assigning free-lance writers to tackle some stories and staff writers who work directly for the magazine to ot hers. Sometimes it is possible to generate magazine coverage by first pitching your story to a writer, who will convince the editor it's worth doing. If you already have a relationship with an editor or writer, you can probably have a conversation in person or by telephone to dis- cuss your story idea. But more likely, you'll have to write a \"query\" letter, asking the editor if the publication is interested in the idea, then send a story outline and either photographs if you al- ready have them or a list of potential photos. Some magazines ask you to include a self-addressed stamped envelope with your query so that they can respond to yo u more quickly. Other editors may call you by phone to discuss the idea."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"C OMMUNICATIONS    199 Most activists use a combination of these outlets to disseminate information about their issues and build support for their cam- paigns. The group you'll read ab out in the following story relied on T-shirts, bumper stickers, broc hures, and pamphlets to build community support for their campai gn to protect their community. But they sparked nati onal interest in their work—particularly among important federal officials— through the local and national newspaper and television stories th ey generated, as well as the con- sistent coverage they received in a trade magazine. Not in Our Backyard Members of the Creek and C herokee nations who live on the banks of the Arkansas River near Gore, Okla- homa. 135 miles east of Ok lahoma City, had always been uncomfortable with the nearby Sequoyah Fuels uranium-processing facility. The place had had numer- ous accidents throughout its twenty-two years, and many residents worried that their air and water were be- ing contaminated with radioactive fallout. When the plant announced plans to open an under- ground storage facility for hazardous waste in 1985, twelve people in the commu nity sat down together to consider their options. All fe lt strongly that the project should be stopped—and that they would have to be the ones to stop it. Forming Na tive Americans for a Clean Environment (NACE), they la unched a vocal and visual campaign against Sequoyah Fuels. \"We made a conscious and focused decision to close it, despite the economic hard ship local residents would perceive such an action as ca using,\" said Lance Hughes, who is part Creek Indian and executive director of NACE. The plant employed three hundred people from the surrounding area, of whom around fifty were Native Americans, and few people fell they could afford to lose their jobs. Hostile workers w ould later call the activists Communists, and even hara ss Lance and other members with death threats. But the group pressed on. Early in the campaign, the activists began issuing"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"200 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS news releases to alert reporters in the region to the cor- poration's plans to build the storage facility. In addition to generating subs tantial favorable coverage in the local media,. Hughes wo rked with a reporter from Nuclear Fuels, an industry trade pub lication widely read by policymakers, nuclear regulators, and industry profes- sionals. The reporter wrote an article every two weeks for two years about the deplorab le shape Sequoyah Fuels was in, using information provided by NACE. NACE published a ten-page newsletter, passed out information on the nuclear indu stry at fairs, and printed posters and postcar ds. One of many T-shirts the group sold displayed a photo of a nine-legged frog, a freak genetic foul-up attributed to the contaminated soil and water. This grisly nine-legged frog was found by a boy in Gore, Oklahoma— downstream from Se- quoyah Fuels. Dan Agent In 1991, it looked like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) might re new Sequoyah's operating license. NACE responded by issuing a damning envi- ronmental assessment report of Sequoyah Fuels that made local news.

They also made it available to the"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"C OMMUNICATIONS 201 NRC. The report, of c ourse, was covered in Nuclear Fuels. In its own investigation of Sequoyah, the NRC had found that water on the pl ant grounds contained 35,000 times the level of uranium considered safe by federal law. Soil samples revealed al most 40 percent pure ura- nium. The facility was illegally discharging tons of ura- nium into the Arkansas Rive r, the ground, and even into the company's administrative offices through the air- conditioning. Through its newsletter, fact sheets, and opinion editorials, NACE wasted no time in reminding the public that minute amo unts of uranium are toxic, and that the metal can't be recovered from a contami- nated substance. An explosion at Sequoyah in 1986 that killed one worker and injured thirty-six others helped capture the attention of the national media. A front-page story in the Washington Post kicked off a string of stories in the New York Times. St. Louis Post Dispatch, and the San Francisco Examiner that helped focus an uncomfortable national spotlight on Sequoya h Fuels. All the while, to avoid losing momentum, NACE kept in frequent contact with reporters who were following the story. \"It involves a lot of phone work, faxing, mailing to reporters ... we wanted to m ake sure that our informa- tion was credible and timely. We needed to break down the secrecy of what is goin g on here,\" Hughes said of the group's ongoing publicity campaign. A New York Times article about raffi nate, a hazardous waste-based fertilizer the nuclear industry was at- tempting to market, inspired NACE to videotape areas where the substance had b een applied. The compelling footage showed dead cows and the burn line where the \"fertilizer\" had been sprayed on trees. NACE sent the video to the largest eastern Ok lahoma television station. where it headlined the nigh tly news. The same station had already produced an aw ard-winning series on Sequoyah, based on the criminal investigation of the fa- cility that was conducted by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from August 1 990 through October 1991 and that had resulted in th e plant's first shutdown, though only for six months."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"202 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS On November 17, 1992, a toxic gas leak that injured thirty-four workers proved to be the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back. Seven days later, and seven years after NACE began its fight, General Atomics, the plant's owners, shut it down. The group's activism earned the surprising praise of Ivan Selin, the chairman of the federal Nuclear Regula- tory Commission, who acknowledged his agency had been pushed in the right direction on nuclear safety is- sues because of the pleas and protests of \"watchdog\" groups like NACE. REACHING THE MEDIA: THE MECHANICS Engaging in various media tactics is the most exciting and fun part of the communications job. But in order to implement any communications strategy well, you need to have certain mechani- cal functions in place. For most groups that means identifying someone or a group of people to do the work, targeting reporters, and developing materials that presen t your group and your issue in the most favorable light. Form a Media Committee Developing and implementing a communications strategy for your organization is hard work, but as the old saying goes, some- one's got to do it. Since many groups can't afford to hire an em- ployee just to coordinate media outreach, they frequently end up forming a media committee. The committee should be led by a coordinator who is experi- enced at working with reporters, writing press releases, and has a basic understanding of how the di fferent media work. (Jan Garton. who has a master's degree in jo urnalism, found her education in- valuable in her efforts to pub licize Cheyenne Bottoms. She knew how reporters operated, understood print and broadcast deadlines, and could anticipate what the me dia would be looking for in her stories.) If no one with such expe rience belongs to your group, find someone who is willing to learn a nd has demonstrated leadership skills. Ask others to join the committee who will help contact report-"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"C OMMUNICATIONS 203 ers, schedule interviews, and trac k the success of the media cam- paign. Everyone should help identify story angles that can be fed to reporters at the appropriate time. Though the committee will do most of the \"hands-on\" work of generating stories and creating a positive relationship with the press, the entire organization should develop an appreciation for the media effort. Those who are responsible for refining the orga- nization's policy positions should help craft and implement media strategies as well, acting as spoke speople and contributing insights about the effects media coverage will have on the organization or a specific campaign. Once a year, the organization as a whole should examine the brochures, pam phlets, and news releases the group produces. Do they contain t oo much copy? Is the copy too strident—or too weak? Are the graphics compelling? Compare the materials you produce to others you like even more, and recom- mend changes that will improve your organization's image and ef- forts. Here's an example of how the media committee of an ad hoc coalition effectively squelched an effort to market cigarettes to blacks in Philadelphia. Nipping It in the Bud Uptown cigarettes looked cool. The slick gold-and- black foil packaging that encased the twenty cigarettes was meant to reflect hip city nightlife, while the sparse ad copy promoting the product nonchalantly suggested: \"Uptown. The Place. The Taste.\" Uptown tasted cool, too. It had a distinctive menthol flavor, a tang some studies showed black smokers in particular would find appealing. In fact, everything about the product was designed to attract blacks, a minority group suffering from the high- est cancer rate in the country and a disproportionately large number of smoking-related deaths. And that delib- erate marketing tactic outraged a lot of people, especially in Philadelphia, where the cigarettes were scheduled for a test launch before being moved into na- tional distribution."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"204 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co mpany (RJR), the ciga- rettes' manufacturer, defended its effort to entice black smokers into choosing Uptown by claiming that blacks had the right to select one cigarette brand over another. But opponents from Philadelphia's African American community, the health indust ry, and other concerned cit- izens believed the clever ca mpaign would actually en- courage more African Americ ans to take up the deadly habit. In their view, RJR had concocted a spurious ratio- nale to justify an insidious campaign. The launch had to be nipped in the bud. Early in January 1991, ju st a few weeks after RJR announced its intention to te st-market the new cigarette in the City of Brotherly Love, representatives of the National Black Leadership Initiative on Cancer, the American Cancer Society, the American Lung Associa- tion, the Committee to Pr event Cancer in Blacks, and others formed the Coalition Against Uptown Cigarettes.

Members of the coalition concluded they had to channel their outrage at the unfair targeting of blacks, protesting the cigarette la unch but avoiding campaign- ing against smoking in genera l so they would not alien- ate smokers. They hoped to appeal to that side of a smoker's psyche that regrets his or her own addiction and doesn't want more y oung people to get hooked. Their program had to oppose marketing this deadly product to a high-risk group, but without casting blacks as poor or uneducated. With these considerations in mind, the coalition opted to combat the tobacco indu stry's sophisticated, polished media campaign with one th at was just the opposite: Though carefully orchestrat ed behind the scenes, it would appear spontaneous on the surface, and would target primarily local medi a, even though national outlets were clamoring for the story. Their first priority was to mobilize community sup- port against the cigarette. The coalition recruited doc- tors, members of the clergy , city council members, and marketers, all African Amer icans, to condemn RJR's campaign, circulating compreh ensive fact sheets inter- nally to keep its spokespeop le fully informed about the issue. The group made a poin t not to condemn target marketing per se because many black agencies engage in the practice themselves. Instead, they challenged RJR's decision to market a deadly product to such a susceptible audience. To attract business leaders in the community as well as those concerned about heal th, they positioned the is- sue as a business story rather than as one focused only on health. When the New York Times requested a list of the coalition members, the co alition waited until it could send a roster that included not just the health-oriented members but all interest an d community groups and in- dividuals that opposed Uptown cigarettes—reinforcing the grass roots image the activists were carefully cultivating. \"The media got excited about the 'real' people—that this was really a grass roots organization."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"206 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS not a bunch of people pushing press releases,\" Sutton said. The coalition did the unheard of when it turned down an offer to appear on AB C-TV's \"Good Morning Amer- ica\": they would have been positioned against black marketers, and did not want to divide the black commu- nity in any way. A better way to mobilize Philadelphi- ans to join the protest, th ey knew, was to encourage coverage by local media, including the Daily News, a Philadelphia tabloid with a large African American readership. In the span of a few shor t weeks, the Stop Uptown campaign attracted a wave of local editorial backing as well as the attention of national media outlets. Dr. Rob- ert G. Robinson, a local researcher who worked in to- bacco control, asked U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan to address the issue during a trip to Philadelphia, which the secretary, himself a black physician, gladly did. (Reporters later wrote lead stories in which they noted the s ecretary's \"scathing indict- ment\" of Uptown cigarettes.) The day after Secretary Sullivan's statements, offi- cials at R. J. Reynolds decided to pull Uptown's test market. The date was January 19, less than two weeks after the coalition's first meeting. The company ex- pected the story to be bur ied in little-read Saturday newspapers. But the papers held the victory story until Sunday, the most-read issue, and gave it significant front-page coverage. Televisi on networks featured the story nationally on Monday. \"It was really a landmark in terms of marketing, community mobilization, and media,\" Sutton remarked when the campaign was over. She said that the group was prepared to distribute damning fliers if RJR per- sisted in distributing the ciga rette to stores in February, but the tactic was not needed. Meanwhile, RJR went back to the drawing board to try to figure out where it had gone wrong. The mistake was not a little one. One industry source estimated that the failed launch cost the company over $5 million—not to mention the negative PR it suffered."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"C OMMUNICATIONS 207 Create a Press List A press list is perhaps an organization's most essential media tool. In one handy, organized place, it helps you keep track of re- porters and editors so that you can phone them and mail informa- tion efficiently and without delay. To develop your list, identify re porters, columnists, and editors at your local newspapers, magazines, radio stations, and television stations who cover a beat that pert ains to your issue. Some of the most common beats include environm ent, science, health, transpor- tation, crime, the arts, and city h all. If the media outlet is small and doesn't have a reporter specifically assigned to your issue area, ask for a general assignment reporter w ho can be interested in your story. You may need to talk to the assignment editor to get the right name. Make two lists: a mailing list, consisting of first and last names of reporters or editors, the name of the outlet, and its address; and a telephone and fax list, consisting of the name of the reporter, the outlet, and the phone and fax number. While you'11 use the first list for mailing press materials, you'll need the second list so that you can easily follow up all your mailin gs with telephone calls, a task you absolutely must undertake to insure that reporters received your materials and are planning to cover your story. (Likewise, give your office and home phone numbers to report- ers. Many media deadlines extend far beyond standard office hours; if a story breaks late, reporters may need to reach someone in the evenings and on weekends . If your office has an answering service or machine, always include a number where a contact can be reached during off hours.) You can develop media lists by painstakingly going through your telephone directory and looki ng up the address and phone number of each outlet. But a quicker way is to use any of the me- dia directories kept in the refere nce section of your local library. Some books to look for include: Bacon's Publicity Checker, Gebbie Press Ail-In-One Directory, Broadcasting Yearbook, and Editor and Publisher You might also be able to borrow media lists that have already been created by othe r groups, such as a local labor union, the United Way, a local hospit al, or one of the organizations participating in your coalition."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"208    T HE B UILDING B LOCKS O UTLETS Y OU S HOULD P UT ON Y OUR P RESS L IST • Daily newspapers • Local radio stations • Local cable systems • Associated Press and United Pres s International wire services • Local magazines • Weekly newspapers • Local bureaus of national newspapers and magazines • Local TV stations • Local affiliates of national TV networks • Organized newsletters • Policymakers, legislators, legislative staff • Other \"VIPs\" (large co ntributors, foundations) R EPORTERS Y OU S HOULD P UT ON Y OUR L IST • Beat reporters • Editorial page editors • Editorial writers on your issue (if they exist) • Assignment editors • Columnists • Feature editors and writers • News directors at radio and TV stations Develop a Press Kit A press kit is a compilation of mate rials that help \"sell\" your is- sue to the media, as well as to possible sponsors, contributors, and even members.

If you send a photograph, it should be a professionally photo- graphed 8-by-JO, black-and-white gl ossy, not a silly-looking snap shot. Type a brief photo caption on a sheet of white paper and rub- ber cement the caption to the back of the photograph.

TACTICS Many tactical tools are available to help you get positive media coverage and sustain media interest in your issue. The following chart offers a brief summary of the many media tactics available to activists and suggests how to use them effectively. The rest of the chapter explains each of thes e tactics in greater detail. Media-Grabbing Tactics How to Use • News releases • Explain position, describe an event. • News advisories • Invite reporters to attend an event. • News conferences • Explain breaking news to reporters. • Letters to the editor • Respond to ed itorial cover- age or demonstrate commu- nity support for an issue. • Editorial meetings • Influence the editorial posi- tion of a newspaper or radio or TV station, especi- ally before an important vote or decision. • Editorial mailings • Explain status of issue or campaign and ask for edi- torial support. • Opinion editorials • Express your opinion on your issue and establish your credentials as a spokes- person. • Special events • Demonstrate strength, rev up media, put pressure on targets."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"C OMMUNICATIONS 211 Media-Grabbing Tactics How to Use • Public service announce- ments, signs, fliers, posters • Educate the public; tell peo- ple where they can call or write for more information, or how to attend meetings or events. • Advertising • Lobby; when coverage from other sources is inad- equate and you have the budget to go directly to the public. • Calendar listings • Turn out people to meet- ings, rallies, other events. • Interview shows • Explain position directly to public. • Community cable • Educate the public, explain your position. • Video • Provide your own footage to the media, legislators, or the public. • Newsletters • Communicate with mem- bers. Press Releases A press release serves many purposes. It may explain a new re- port, announce an upcoming event, reveal your position on an is- sue, provide background information, or supplement an ongoing news story. It expresses your poin t of view as you would like to see it reiterated by the media in a headline and in the way the story is reported. Some smaller newspapers (particularly weeklies) may print a news release verbatim, actually cutting off the bottom of the re- lease before they send it to be typeset for the paper to accommo- date their space limitations. That practice is frowned upon at larger media outlets, which use news releas es to help decide whether to cover a story, but then go out a nd get the facts themselves. Be- cause editors may spend only a few minutes scanning the first few paragraphs of the release, you ca n increase the impact the release can have by following standard journalistic procedure and putting"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"212 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS the most important information first (putting the most critical infor- mation at the top of the release w ill also make sure your key points make it into the paper should an editor at a smaller outlet take a pair of scissors to it!). The diagram below is called an \"inverted pyramid.\" It repre- sents the way you should present your information in your news release. The cardinal rule is: Put the most important information about your story at the top. Subs equent paragraphs should contain useful information that substantiates your opening paragraphs, as well as quotes from your spokespeopl e. But if you want to pique a reporter's interest, put the essential news first. What elements of your story sh ould you consider \"essential\"? These usually revolve around the \"Five W's\"—what (is happen- ing), who (is involved), where (is it happening), when (is it hap- pening), and why (is it happening) . The most newsworthy of the W's goes first, the next most newsworthy W goes next, and so on until you've laid out all of the W's in the most newsworthy way."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"C OMMUNICATIONS 213 To determine which of the W's is the most newsworthy, review the criteria at the beginning of this chapter. Then make some judg- ments. For example, if the \"who\" is famous enough (like the Pres- ident of the United States or the Pope), almost anything he or she does will make news. But for most activist groups, their biggest news will revolve around the \"what.\" \"Environmentalists said to- day that . . .\" is not very newswo rthy. \"The Dallas water supply is contaminated, according to a re port released today by the public health department\" is. While your press release might seem extremely newsworthy to you. it is likely to be just another piece of paper to a news editor, who could receive two hundred rel eases on any given day. Pressed for time and forced to meet strict deadlines, the editor may not read more than two or three para graphs before deciding to either loss your news in the trash or give it to a reporter for follow-up. So use releases sparingly but effectively. When reflecting on the Cheyenne Bottoms campaign, organi zer Jan Garton said that they could have issued more releases and maintained an even larger presence in the media, but she felt that the press paid better atten- tion to their occasional, well-p lanned releases about concrete events than they would have to more frequent releases, not all of which might have been important.

Try to be somewhat objective in the way you present your information. Let the news speak for itself. • Put the most important information first. Include who, what, when, where, why, and how in the first paragraph. Be ac- curate with all names, numbers, statements, and quotes. • Keep it to two pages. The release should be double-spaced, with wide margins. Write in the active voice, which is easier to read and requires fewer words. Keep sentences and paragraphs short. Copy the second page on the back of the first to save pa- per. • Issue the release on your organization's stationery. If you don't have stationery, put your organization's name, address, and logo at the top of the paper. Write \"For Release\" in the up- per left-hand corner, followed by the date you wish the informa- tion to be available for coverage. In the right-hand corner, provide the name of one or two contact people, along with home and work phone numbers where they can be reached. • Include a quote from someon e representing your organi- zation by at least the third paragraph of the release to identify your organization and add interest to the text. • Type the word \"more\" or \"over\" at the bottom of the first page; type \"- 30 -\" or \"###\" at the end of the release. • Include one or two sentences that describe your organiza- tion at the end of the release. • Mail, fax, or hand-deliver releases at least one week before you want the story to appear. If your story is complicated or you're releasing a detailed document, distribute it earlier to give reporters more time to review it.

What should you do? • Send out a news release or information packet. The mate- rial should meet the criteria for newsworthiness described on page 190. • Follow up with a phone call. Try to reach every person to whom you mailed the information. Attempt to secure a commit- ment from each one to at least consider the story, and to attend an event if you are organizing one. • Arrange interviews. If the reporter is interested in your story but cannot attend your event or has other time constraints, try to schedule a one-on-one interview with the reporter and your spokesperson at the reporter's convenience. • Think visually. Television reporters in particular are not in- terested in what they call \"talking heads\": one or several people who do nothing more entertaining in front of the camera than move their mouths. You'll have more success if you offer re- porters an interesting picture to accompany your words. Re- member the success of the Save Cheyenne Bottoms Task Force?

If you're having a hard lime convincing television to cover your issue, fax the report er or editor any newspaper clips you've generated about it, accompa nied by a pitch noting how cur- rent the issue is. A final note about pitching a story: Occasionally you may be in the position of having to interest reporters in more than one story at the same time. How do you jugg le your desire an d need for cov- erage with a reporter's natural reluctance to do more than one story on your organization in any gi ven week (or even month)? First, try to avoid the situa tion by developing a well-planned media strategy that reasonably time s your events an d news releases so that they don't fall on top of each other. Co nvene your media committee regularly to discuss upcoming activities and to antici- pate unexpected media opportunities and decide ahead of time how to handle them in th e event conflicts occur. If you're still faced with severa l competing events, reevaluate the news stories remaining on your plate. Prioritize them again for newsworthiness to make sure they all merit serious news attention (the last thing you want to do is develop a negative reputation among reporters as someone a bout whom they can complain, \"There's not enough ink in the world to satisfy you\"). Hold off on promoting the less important storie s to avoid undercutting yourself. Now take a look at your press list. Can you parcel out your story ideas so that different report ers get different stories? For ex- ample, suppose you are launching a new program to educate preg- nant women about the causes of infa nt mortality at the same time you are preparing a detailed report about the incidence of infant mortality in your community. Review your press list. Then get the hard news reporter to look into the conclusions of the report, and urge a features reporter to do a special about your new educational program. During those periods when you simply can't avoid going back to the same reporters several times in the course of a few days or weeks, be up front with the me dia about what the future holds. Call reporters and let them know th at you'll be in touch with them frequently, convey to them the newsworthiness of all of your sto- ries, and ask them for suggestio ns on how you can avoid over- loading them and still get them th e information they need to stay apprised of your issue. Most repo rters will appreciate the advance warning, and you'll come off lo oking like a savvy media profes- sional."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":" This news advisory invited reporters in Oregon to Mission: Possible fund-raising and media events. 219"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"220 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS News Advisories A news advisory differs from a news release in that it acts like an invitation to an event. Ralher than contain all of the details about the event itself, it only focuses on the most important information—the lead of the story. It should be one page long, and should explain in one or two sent ences what the event is about, where it is. when it is, what time it is to take place, and who will be participating. It should also contain the name and phone number (home and work) of someone in your organization who can be contacted for more information. News Conferences A news conference is a gathering of reporters convened to pro- vide a story to them all at the sa me time. Beat and general assign- ment reporters for print, radio, and TV are most likely to attend news conferences, though columnists might as well. Reporters despise news conferences unless they offer real news. A press conference that consists of nothing more than \"talking heads\" needs a stronger, more sensational peg to draw the media out than a colorful, photogenic eve nt like a marathon. (However, in smaller cities, where there is less competition for hard news, it is easier to be considered \"newswor thy\".) So it is essential that you truly have something newsworthy to discuss before you convene a news conference (review the criter ia on page 190). Releasing a controversial report, filing a laws uit, or announci ng a boycott, picket, or some other dramatic action a l l make for good news conferences, especially if they are spiced up with good sound and visual images. If your topic doesn't warrant a ne ws conference, consider sev- eral alternatives: Issue a news re lease by mail or fax, then try to arrange one-on-one interviews with reporters who are particularly interested in your topic. Or orga nize a \"background briefing\" over an informal breakfast or lunch to discuss the story. Sometimes, even though you've or ganized a good, solid press activity, you'll get overshadowed by a more stunning event—such as a local fire or plane crash. In that case, hand-carry your press release and other materials to re porters and attempt to schedule one-one-one interviews and in-studi o interviews on th e spot or the following day."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"C OMMUNICATIONS    221 • • STEP BY STEP • • How to Organize a News Conference . Determine that your event merits a news conference. Re- view the criteria described on pa ge 190 to make sure the event is newsworthy. • Choose the right location. If you are planning to picket a factory, hold the news conference outside th e factory gates (get a permit if necessary). You can al so hold news conferences at your own offices—if you have a room large enou gh—or at your city's Press Club (though you ma y need to be a member or have a member sponsor you). The locat ion should be safe, easy to reach, relatively close to the center of town, and offer access to parking. If you need ad vice about desirable sites, ask a friendly reporter for suggestions. Take precautions if you're holding the conference outside. Though an outdoor activity may work for you symbolically, bad weather co uld put a real damper on the event; in your news advisory, identify a rain location to which reporters should go if it's raini ng thirty minutes before the event is scheduled to begin. • Choose the right day. Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday are better days than Monda y or Friday. Reporter s may forget about the event over the weekend, and on Friday they may be leaving work early, or may be prepari ng stories for the weekend. Week- ends aren't often a good option, either, because so few reporters are on the job (although you'll have less competition for news). If you do have to hold an event on a Saturd ay or Sunday, make sure you alert the \"weekend assignment editors\" well in ad- vance. And if you opt for a Mo nday, remind reporters on Friday and again first thin g Monday morning. • Hold your event between 9:30 A . M . and 1:00 P . M . Any earlier than that, and reporter s will have a hard time getting there—unless you're inviting them to breakfast. Any later, and reporters will miss their d eadlines for filing stories. • Notify reporters in advance. Send out a written news advi- sory so that it reaches reporters at leas t a week before your event. A word of caution: Don't \"scoop\" yourself if a reporter"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"222 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS How to Organize a News Conference (cont.) reads your advisory and wants to do your story before your press conference or event. The point of an advisory is to get the media to cover your event, not to get them to do an early story—and spoil your chances of coverage with everyone else. Politely tell eager reporters they must wait for the event to get all the details. Putting the wo rds \"Embargoed Until\" with the date and time of your event on your advisory will alert reporters that the story is not available to be released until that date and time. • List the event on the \"daybooks.\" A daybook is a comput- erized calendar of media events that is maintained by the local newswire service and fed electron ically into newsrooms. All as- signment editors regularly consult the newswire to find out what is happening during that day or in that week. In most cities, the daybook is published by the lo cal Associated Press and/or United Press International bureaus. You can also pay a fee to a placement service such as PR Ne wswire (check your telephone directory for a local phone numbe r), an agency that will send your announcement to newsrooms the same way the daybooks do. Fax the daybooks a copy of your news advisory, then call to make sure they received it and will list it. • Follow up by telephone. Phone the reporters to make sure they received the news advisory and plan to attend your news conference. If they don't plan to attend, try to set up a one-on- one interview with your spokesperson so that you don't lose the opportunity for coverage. (Many reporters now allow you to fax news releases to them. If you can get access to a facsimile ma- chine, you can get your materi als into a newsroom yourself.) • Prepare a press kit. The kit should include a press release summarizing your story in news format, a verbatim statement of what speakers will say, brief biographical profiles of each speaker that include their full na me and correct title if they have one, fact sheets or backgrounders that further substantiate your position, and other materials that help make your case compel- ling. The press kits should be distributed to reporters as they sign into the news conference; reporters who do not attend"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"C OMMUNICATIONS 223 How to Organize a News Conference (cont.) the news conference can get a kit afterward by mail or special delivery. • Prepare yourself. Prepare for the news event thoroughly. Anticipate tough questio ns. Make a list of the kinds of questions you're likely to get asked and practice short, quotable answers. Hold a mock press conf erence with others in your organization. • Think visually. Having good pictures to show will greatly enhance the likelihood th at television will cover your event. Un- usual charts or graphs, videotape , slides, large mounted blowups of photographs, maps, ballots, letters, or petitions will work well. All slides for television shou ld be horizontal, in color, and graphically simple. Color labs and graphics shops can inexpen- sively produce charts for you on their computers. To alert assignment editors that you have good photos, the advisory should include the words \"Photo Opportunity Avail- able\" followed by a brief descrip tion of what the \"photo op\" is. (You can also include a descripti on of the visual in the body of the advisory. A group enticed reporters to one press conference by beginning: \"Surrounded by a jumble of dead and broken trees in a massive clearcut, an Ar kansas Congressman will intro- duce a bill to protect .. .\") • Take pictures. If you can, hire a photographer. If you can't afford it, have someone in yo ur organization take pictures. Though large daily newspapers prob ably won't want to use your photos, smaller weekli es might. The pictures will also come in handy for your own internal publ ic relations pur poses, such as inclusion in annual reports, ne wsletters, promotional brochures, and fliers. • Prepare the room. Don't pick one that's too big, or you'll look like you've had a flop even if a lot of people show up. And avoid one that's too small, or you'll have disgruntled reporters standing outside in the hall compla ining. If you can afford it, of- fer reporters coffee, tea, and ju ice; otherwise ice water will do. Equip the room with f l i p charts or whatever other technical equipment you need, a podium w ith a microphone, a \"mult box\" that allows several reporters to easily record th e event by plug- ging into the podium microphone, risers in the back of the room"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"224 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS How to Organize a News Conference (cont.) for TV cameras, and a table in th e front for radio reporters to set up on. Attach a sign bearing your group's name and logo to the podium so that it appears in a ll camera shots. A quick-print shop can probably make you a 15 -by-19-inch sign for less than $50; the sign can be reused m any times. Ask the hotel or Press Club to list your event on the daily events board in the lobby. If you're holding your event at a more exotic lo cation, you may need to post your own signs. • Set up a sign-in table right outside the room. Ask one of your volunteers to register repo rters and hand out press materi- als. Record the name, outlet, and phone number for each re- porter who attends so that y ou know who did and didn't show up. Signing in reporters also gives you a chance to introduce yourself to those you don't kn ow and gel reacquainted with those you do. • Get started. Begin the conference a pproximately five min- utes after the designated time. Introduce yourself, welcome all those in the room and thank them for attending. Introduce your other speakers, then read your own remarks if you have any. If not, the other statements should begin. • Let a limited number of peop le speak on your behalf. The last thing reporters want to hear is one person after another de- liver a speech. Organize the key points you need to present, and have them presented by no more th an four people. If the confer- ence is being convened by a coaliti on, let other people sit on the stage behind the podium; they ca n be called upon to answer questions if necessary. They can also prepare written remarks to include in the press kit. All sp eakers should have written state- ments prepared, which they should read regardless of how many (or how few) reporters attend t he event. No delivered statement should be longer than five minut es. When reading the statement, look up from the paper occasional ly to make eye contact with reporters, and to be more effective in delivering the best \"sound bites.\" • Answer questions. After a l l the statemen ts have been made, open the conference up to questions from reporters.

Expe ct additional questions \"one- on-one\" after the news conf erence, especially from the electronic media (radio and TV stations), who may ask you questions to get you to reiterate key points or your best quotes. • Close the news conference. Try to l i m i t the conference to no more than an hour. Thank a l l those who came, and offer to answer any additional questions or provide more information if needed. • Follow up again. When the conference is over, fax or de- liver by hand press kits to any key reporters who planned to at- tend but didn't. Return to your o ffice or home in the event that reporters need to contact you fo r additional information. Follow up with any reporters at the news conference who asked for in- formation you couldn't provide. • Get clips of stories. Monitor the media for stories based on your news conference. Keep cop ies of stories that appear in newspapers or magazines. If you can afford it, ask a local TV and radio monitoring service ( check your telephone directory or the Press Club for names) to tape radio reports and TV news stories for your archives. These might also help you compile a promotional videotape of your group at a later date. Usually, you can't get reporters to travel far out of town to cover a story, unless they're on the campaign trail with a presiden- tial candidate or their beat is fo reign affairs and they have no choice but to travel halfway around the world. So when the Washington. DC, organizers of the 1980 Year of the Coast decided to kick off their event, they were taking a risk. On a morning when everyone they knew (including reporters) would rather sleep in (January 1), and on one of the coldest days of the year, they organized a symb olic beach walk along a coast- line an hour away from the city. Remarkably, the idea worked li ke a charm. Despite whatever hangovers reporters, crews, and ac tivists might have been feeling after ringing in the New Year, a crowd of media and participants showed up at Sandy Point State Pa rk on the shores of the Chesa-"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"226 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS peake Bay to announce their plans to wage a year-long campaign to protect America's coastlines. What compelled editors to send re porters to a beach on the first day of the year? Frankly, there wasn 't a lot else going on that day and editors still needed to fill their news \"holes,\" the spaces allot- ted for stories, not advertising. The canny strategy resulted in a big payoff for the organizers. All three local TV stations attende d the event, as did reporters and photographers from the Washington Post, the New York Times, and National Public Radio, giving the campaign a national launch as well. Letters to the Editor The \"Letters to the Editor\" section of newspapers and maga- zines provides a forum that lets you deliver your message directly to a large audience. Through lett ers you can explain how your is- sue relates to items being covered in the news, correct or interpret facts after an inaccurate or biased article has appeared, respond to an editorial or op-ed piece, or rebut a news or feature story. Letters to the editor can also be used to spur editorial writers or news editors to cover an issue they had thought their readers weren't interested in. According to several surveys, more people read letters to the ed- itor than any other section of the paper. A letter to the editor should be brief, clear, and to the point. You can write it either as an individu al or as a representative of your group. Be sure to include your a ddress, as well as phone numbers at work and at home. Type your le tter, or handwrite clearly. Try to limit the text to one page, as shor t letters are more likely to be printed than long ones, and be po lite. Make sure any facts and fig- ures you use are accurate. If your letter isn't printed, don't be dis- couraged; keep trying. To generate a number of letters , organize a letters-to-the-editor committee and give the members outlines of sample letters. Stag- ger the mailing of their letters a few days apart when responding to a timely topic, or a week or mo re apart when trying to maintain general interest in the topic.

Reprinted courtesy the Boyertown Times Editorial Meetings Editorials have clout. Whether they correctly reflect public opinion or not editorials tend to be perceived by policymakers as represent- ing the majority view of the loca l area. Thus, legislators and policy- makers read them to get a sense of which way the political winds are blowing and to determine whether or not a position they're taking is going to make them popular or get them hanged (figuratively speak- ing, of course). And the public turn s to them to help make up their minds. Just as you strive to gene rate news (and, to a lesser extent, feature) coverage about your campaig n, you should make it a priority in your media strategy to ge nerate favorable editorials. Try to meet with editorial wr iters in person. Request the meeting by letter, followed by a te lephone call. Ask to meet with the editorial writer who most frequently addresses your topic, though at larger papers the editor of the editorial page and other members of the editorial staff (also known as the \"editorial board\"), along with reporters who cover the issue, may sit in, too. (At smaller newspapers, editorial positions are determined by the"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"228 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS paper's publisher or managing edit or, with whom you can also at- tempt to meet.) At the meeting, make a solid pr esentation of your story, con- ducting yourself in a friendly but businesslike way. Expect tough, probing questions—editorial writers consider it their duty to thor- oughly explore both sides of an issue. Emphasize not only why your issue is important but also when an editorial on the topic could have the greatest impact. Unlike reporters, editorial writers are expected to take sides; the ed itorial meeting gives you an un- usual opportunity to lobby editoria lists to adopt your point of view and express it in the paper. You can generate an ed itorial on your TV or radio station in much the same way. Contact the st ation to determine if the station manager, the public affairs director, or the public service director of the station is responsible for editorials. Then send a letter ex- plaining your position, along with background information on the issue. Follow up with a personal me eting or telephone call to stress the importance of an edito rial favoring your position. For both print and electronic media, send a short thank-you note after the meeting. Include any new details that reinforce your po- sition. Then monitor th eir coverage. Have your volunteers ready to follow up any editorial with approp riate approving or disapproving letters to the editor. A favorable editorial merits a phone call from you to the writer thanking h i m or her personally. If the editor will not meet with you, attempt to have a lengthy telephone conversation. Keep all editorial writers regularly in- formed with news releases, back ground papers, fact sheets, and other materials you develop for the campaign. Editorial Cartoonists Editorial cartoonists, whose drawin gs caricature issues, politics, and politicians on the editorial pa ge, should not be overlooked as another avenue of publicity. Tho ugh few cartoonists agree to at- tend meetings, they can still be lobbied via the ma il and. occasion- ally, telephone. Their cartoons, reflective of their sometimes substantial knowledge of and intere st in an issue, often carry as much zing as an edito rial or op-ed piece. Don't assume that a cartoonist's position reflects that of the newspaper that employs him or her.

Editorial Mailings In addition to keeping editorial writers apprised of your issue through the normal flow of information you send out, you may want to develop specific mailings aimed at editorial writers when a vote or decision is imminent a nd an editorial favorable to your position is essential. Send a one- or two-page \"editori al memorandum,\" addressed to editorial writers and editors, with the date and your name clearly indicated. Explain the ta ctical situation you're in and explicitly ask for editorial support at this time. Attach a breaking-news release, a relevant fact sheet or backgrounde r, and copies of favorable ed- itorials from other papers. Follow up by telephone. Op-Eds Op-eds can help raise public awareness on issues, inform elected officials and policymakers, suggest solutions to important problems, and educate the media. Op -eds are longer than letters to the editor (750 words as opposed to one or two paragraphs). They are usually printed opposite the ed itorial page, and generally are widely read. Unlike straight news stories, op -ed pieces allow the writer to ex- press a point of view. Still, they must be very well written and to the point, offering a fresh perspec tive on a timely issue. To write an op-ed. develop an outline of the most important arguments about your issue you want to make . Use anecdotes or vignettes that put the story in a context readers can relate to and that make the op-ed more appealing. Offer solution s to the specific problems that concern you rather than whin e about the problems alone. Even though you are writing to st ate an opinion, the more your point of view is bolstered by solid facts and figures, the more likely it is that your piece will run. Quote expert s and authorities whose opinions substantiate your own. Editors are inclined to run an op-ed piece if it is written by someone who is well respected in the community or is in a posi- tion of authority vis-a-vis the issu e being discussed. So to enhance the chances that your op-ed will be printed, co-sign it with an in- dividual editors will recognize and respect. Unfortunately, most editors will not \"commission\" op-ed pieces."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":" Nancy Ricci's passionate appeal to take action against drunk drivers sounded from the op-ed page of the Meriden Record-Journal.

Send the letter, the op-ed. and your press kit to the editor. Call at least twi ce to urge the editor to print your piece and to remind him or her about its timeliness. If your op-ed is rejected, rewrite it into a shorter version and re- submit it as a letter to the editor. Special Events Special events—l i k e fairs, cel ebrations, demonstrations, and fund-raisers—can generate substantial positive publicity for your group. For an in-depth description of how to organize successful events, see Chapter 3. Public Service Announcements Public Service Announcements (P SAs) are advertisementlike messages made on behalf of nonpr ofit groups (for a description of what constitutes a nonprofit group, see Chapter 4). Most radio and television stations and some newspapers and magazines run PSAs free of charge as a community service, though they are under no legal obligation to do so. PSAs can be used to announce a m eeting, invite the public to a rally or celebration, build membership, raise money, or provide in- formation. They will not be used if they attempt to lobby for a piece of legislation, elect someone to office, or are otherwise po- litical in nature. In other words, you can use PSAs to invite people to a candidate's forum—not to te ll them which candidate to vote for. Although they can be useful in reaching a mass audience, PSAs suffer from several limitations. You cannot determine when the spots will appear or what kind of story they will accompany. (Fre- quently, they run on broadcast outlets in the wee hours of the morning, when the fewest people are watching or listening). They're very labor intensive to produce and place. And they have very limited (if any) impact on policymakers. To get substantial placements you must convince an outlet that your message is espe- cially important to its local audience. In fact, some organizers feel that you should only turn to PSA s when you've done everything else to organize and publicize your issue."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"232 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS Still, if you decide to produce PSAs, these gene ral tips should help you make the most of your pl acement efforts for both broad- cast and print outlets. B ROADCAST (R ADIO AND TV) Although exact guidelines for the acceptance of PSAs vary from station to station, so me general rules hold: • The sponsoring group must be a nonprofit organization. • All announcements must identif y the sponsoring groups. • Finished or preproduced PSAs mu st be provided to the outlet at least three weeks before you want them to run. earlier if possible. • PSAs that promote a specific event or activity are more likely to be used than those th at address long-term issues or revolve solely around encouraging people to join a group. According to The Advertising Co uncil, a consortium of adver- tising executives from around the Un ited States that helps nonpro- fit clients develop and place PSA campaigns, shorter broadcast PSAs and smaller print PSAs get used more frequently than longer, larger ones. The Ad Council's su rveys of outlets that carry PSAs show that ten- and twenty-second spots garner the most air time, while print PSAs that take up an eighth, a quarter, or other fraction of a page receive more placemen ts than do full-page PSAs. When you approach the radio and television stations in your area for air time, keep in mi nd these following suggestions:"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"C OMMUNICATIONS 233 • • STEP BY STEP • • How to Get Your PSA on the Air • Telephone the station. Ask to speak to the public service di- rector. Give your name, the or ganization you represent, and briefly explain the campaign. Ask if you can make an appoint- ment to come in and discuss your request. Always attempt to make your case in person. • If you are asked to send your PSA by mail, draft a letter and send it along with your PSA. The letter should explain why PSAs on your issue are important to your community. If the public service director agrees to meet with you at the station, prepare the letter anyway and subm it it as part of your \"formal\" request. If the station agrees to air the spots, you will not need the letter. If you are turned down, ask that a letter of reply be sent to you, giving the reasons for the station's rejection of the spots. • Provide the public service director with a \"PSA Cam- paign Kit\" that includes the following items: * a brochure, fact sheet, or pr ess kit describing your group; * a copy of your press releas e announcing the purpose of the campaign; * a letter from the IRS or some written material regarding your group's tax status if the station requires it; * scripts of the radio spots and videocassettes of the televi- sion spots if they are prepr oduced; announcer copy for spots you want read on-air; * a \"bounce back\" postcard that outlets can complete listing when the spots aired or will air to help you keep track of outlets that use the spots for future PSA campaigns. • Follow up the meeting wi th a letter of thanks. Even if the station refuses to air your spots now. send a letter expressing your desire for reconsideration in the future. • Monitor stations to insure that your spots are being carried.

There are several advantages to submitting radio PSAs as live copy. It is less expe nsive to submit a written script than to tape a spot. And announcer-read copy can be much more effective since the announcer's voice is familia r to the station listeners. Approximate word count for PSAs: 10-second spot: 20 words 20-seeond spot: 50 words 30-second spot: 75 words 45-second spot: 110 words 60-second spot: 150 words When writing a script, fo llow these guidelines: • Get the attention of the audi ence.

Call the station to dete rmine its preference before pro- ducing a spot that will not be used. Ask the following questions: • Will the station accept both tapes and scripts, or only scripts to be read by announcers? Does the radio station want a cas- sette tape or reel-to-reel spools? • How many copies of the script s/tapes does the station require? • How much lead time does the sta tion need to fit PSAs into its schedule? Television PSAs are very expensiv e to produce. Film and vid- eotape, camera crews, on-camera \"talent,\" editing, and reproducing the spot could cost you several th ousand dollars, even if you pro- duce a simple spot. Before you begi n to rack up costs, ask your community cable station if it can help you produce a PSA. Local cable stations frequently offer training in video production skills to members of the community, providing access to cameras, editing equipment and studio space, as well as staff assistance on the pro- duction itself. When preparing to distribute your PSAs, ask televi- sion stations what format they pref er to receive them in: one-inch, three-quarter-inch, or beta. (You can submit live copy and a slide to a TV station if you don't have a videotape to distribute, but it probably won't be used much.) P RINT Most newspapers and magazines are reluctant to forego advertis- ing revenue to run free public se rvice announcements. The nature of the medium also works against public service advertisers: \"The prob- lem with print media,\" says Jim La seter of Wray Ward Laseter Ad- vertising in Charlotte, North Carolin a, \"is that a newspaper is an expandable medium; a publisher can decrease the number of pages at will if there is not enough material to fill them. Radio, on the other hand, has a set amount of air time that it has to fill.\" Large-circulation magazines that are distributed nationally (like Time, Life, or Ebony) receive a flood of print PSAs every week and tend to choose those that ar e slickly produced and pertain to an issue that's perceived to be of national importance. Smaller lo- cal or regional magazines may be interested in your issue, but their available ad space is tighter: most run PSAs on a space-available"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"238 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS basis and may have to choose only those that represent a publish- er's pet cause or charity. The same rules generally hold true for newspapers. Most of the large daily papers do not run PSAs at all (unless they are produced by The Advertising Council), while others print only PSAs about issues that the publisher is pers onally interested in. Smaller news- papers vary in their PSA policies. The Burlington Free Press in Burlington, Vermont (circulation 54,000), does not run free PSAs but offers about a 30 percent di scount for religious groups and charities that purchase ads. The Ithaca Journal in central New York State (circulation 24,000), on the other hand, runs a few pub- lic service advertisements per day, and tries to include all that the paper receives. The Phoenix Newspapers, Inc., publisher of three papers in that city, takes public service a step further by choosing a community issue it feels needs to be addressed and building a public service advertisement campaign around it. \"PSA space is limited today,\" said Laura Atwell, manager of community and corporate affairs for the newspaper group, which has a combined circulation of around 500,000. \"There are few opportunities for grass roots groups to gel into the paper.\" She told of one campaign. launched in 1990, that was spurred by the unusually high nu mber of child drownings that had occurred in Phoenix's backyard pools. The newspaper group's community and corporate affairs department sought out a coalition of companies, officials, media, and parents that had organized to fight the problem, and worked with them to create awareness ads that ran in all three papers for three years. Newspapers and magazines have slightly different requirements for the artwork they'll accept as a PSA. Newspapers generally ac- cept black-and-white only, and artwork should be printed at ap- proximately a 65-line screen. The line screen designation signifies the density of the tiny dots that form the image. Newspapers and magazines use different printing technologies, and artwork must be prepared accordingly. Magazines pref er color ad \"slicks\"; in fact, the more colorful or visually striking the ad is the more likely they are to place it. Magazine PSAs shoul d be printed at approximately a 110-line screen. And remember, all print PSAs should be devel- oped in several different sizes—fu ll-page, half-page, quarter-page, eighth-page—to increase the ch ances they will be used."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":" Businesses can have their own drug problems.

A PSA Campaign Brings People Back to the Park Meridian Hill Park opened in the nation's capital in 1936 with 11 1/2 acres of lush gardens, imposing statuary, and spectacular fountains de signed to rival Paris\"s breathtaking Tuilleries. The site of popular starlight con- certs and l i g h t i n g displays for the next twenty years, the national park hosted Pear l Bailey and the Von Trapp Family Singers, among many other celebrated entertain- ers. But lack of fundi ng and upkeep by the National Park Service in the 1960s gradually surrendered the park to the ravages of crime. Several attempts to revital- ize the area, which had come to be called Malcolm X Park, failed; before long, gang activity, drug dealing,"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"C OMMUNICATIONS 241 and murder had supplanted the wholesome entertain- ment that had made Meridian Hill so special. When a local boy was kille d there in a drug-related execution in January of 19 90, concerned citizens took matters into their own hands. Residents of the four eth- nically diverse neighborhood s that bordered the park formed a crime patrol and b egan policing the area to in- timidate the derelicts. They badgered the Park Service to make the sanctuary safe ag ain. And they formed the Task Force to Save Meridian Hill—later, Friends of Me- ridian Hill Inc. (FOMH)—so t hat they could take direct action and achieve more immediate results. The determined activists b egan to overhaul the park, cleaning up both its lawns and its image. FOMH dog- gedly nagged the Park Service to repair lights, install more trash bins, and step up park patrols. On Earth Day 1990, volunteers picked up ga rbage and planted trees. The hell-raisers also launche d a lobbying campaign to pressure the Park Service to spend more money to re- store the Meridian Hill grounds and chase out the ri ff- raff. To draw people back to Meridian Hill, the heartened group scheduled an appealing lineup of cultural events. A booming July 4 celebration in 1990 featured the first starlight concert in fifteen years and paved the way for the annual Save Our Park Da y, regular concert seasons, community picnics, even a bi rthday party for the regal statue of Joan of Arc that gr aces the center of the hill on which the park is built. The activists have been a pplauded for the substantial drop in crime their activitie s engendered. But for many. Meridian Hill's scary reputati on lingers. Though it again has its \"regulars\"—one local man reverently speaks of the park as \"the most beau tiful place in the world\"— many Washingtonians still ch oose to take the long way around rather than walk th eir dogs through Meridian Hill. To erase these last vestiges of fear, FOMH decided to advertise the rebirth of Meridi an Hill in a public service advertising campaign featuring the park's most stunning feature: its cascading fountain s, reputedly th e largest in the country."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"242 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS Since the park was acce ssible by the newly com- pleted \"green line\" of the city's Metro subway system, the group approached Metro for free advertising space, promising an ad that would promote both the park and the subway. Metro generously agreed, donating large il- luminated panels in twelve different locations through- out the subway system that wo uld normally cost a group $600 a month per panel. Now the group needed the act ual PSA. Just as it be- gan to search for an inexpensive but striking photo of the fountains, a Baltimore pho tographer serendipitously phoned offering the activists free photos he had taken of the park. A sympathetic adve rtising agency agreed to produce the PSA at the discounted cost of $3,500. which was still a substantial sum to the nonprofit advo- cates of Meridian Hill. Lu ckily, a FOMH member (who was a former employee of the local C&P Telephone company) managed to raise ev ery precious dollar by sending a letter to the president of C&P and following up diligently. Steve Colema n. FOMH president, ex- plained the group's good fo rtune in fund-raising and public relations in a word: ambition. \"Groups can 'ar- range' to be lucky,\" he said . \"People come out of the woodwork to help.\" FOMH's good luck continues. As the group prepares to unveil the beautiful PSA, whose copy—\"Experience the Renaissance: Take the Green Line to Europe\"— celebrates Meridian Hill's cu ltural diversity and lives up to its promise to Metro offi cials, a national lighting company has tentatively offere d to illuminate the cas- cading fountain permanently, which is now shrouded in darkness at night. Original ly, Coleman said, the huge fountain was designed to be lit so brightly that it would make the park visible from the air. The PSA will have a wider audience than those who ride the subway in Washington, DC. FOMH plans to mail reproductions of the PSA , coupled with news clip- pings about the park's makeo ver, to travel guidebooks such as Fodor's and Michelin 's.

This lit subway PSA encouraged riders of the Washington, DC, subway system to \"Experience the Renaissance\" and visit the city's Meridian Hill Park. Advertising There are times in a campaign when you need to bypass the \"media gatekeepers\" (publishers, editors, producers, and reporters) and take your message—undiluted— directly to the public. There are also times when your issue is ju st too controversial to be pro- moted adequately in a PSA campaign. When instances like this oc- cur, provided you can raise the money, you may opt to buy advertisements. Paid advertising is appealing for several reasons. It gives you much greater control over when your message runs, where it runs, and what it says. Paid ads can thus be far more effective in promot- ing a controversial issue or urging people to take a position on a con- tentious topic. While PSAs can be used to announce an event (for example: \"Attend a public hearing to discuss question #3\") and relay information, paid ads (in many, but not all. cases) can tell people what to do (\"Be on the safe side: Vote for question #3\")."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"244 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS Activists also turn to paid ads when the timing of an issue is critical and they can't wait for a PSA placement, when they need to counter an opponent's advertisi ng or respond to attacks, when they want to reframe the way an i ssue is being discussed, or sim- ply to thank their supporters. B ROADCAST A DS Depending on the city or \"media market\" in which you live, ra- dio and television time can be extr emely expensive. The cost of an ad will depend on how long it is, wh at time it runs, and how often it runs. A sixty-second radio spot in a major market such as Phil- adelphia, aired between 6:00 A . M . and 6:00 P . M ., would cost be- tween $800 and $1,000. For a sma ller suburban station, the same spot could cost as little as $20. Rates for TV ads vary much more. A thirty-second overnight or early-morning spot on a Philadelphia station would cost around $200, an early news spot would go for around $2,000; prime time placemen ts during specials or sporting events would cost $10,000 or more. In general, the smaller the ADI (area of dominant influence) or geographical area that the TV signal covers, the cheaper the ad. Ca ble TV is usually cheaper than broadcast TV in the same ADI; you may also be able to buy print ads in the viewer's guide. P RINT A DS The price of placing print ad s also varies, depending on the size circulation of the publicatio n you're buying space in and the size ad you plan to run. Some ne wspapers and magazines offer dis- count rates for charities, though you'll need to verify that your or- ganization meets the outlet's definition of what constitutes a charity. Most likely, you'll have to show proof that you're a 501(c)(3) organization in order to receive the outlet's charity rates; even then, you may be excluded if your group is deemed too con- troversial. Advertising rates at newspapers vary widely. Compare the fol- lowing September/October 1993 rates at four dailies of different sizes. Rates and circulation are for weekday papers; Sunday rates and circulations are typically slightly higher (a column inch is one column wide and one inch deep). • The Houston Chronicle, Houston, Texas (circulation 423,000). Standard rale is $156.96 per column inch; charity rate is $90.12 per column inch."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"COMMUNICATIONS 245 • The Salt Lake City Tribune, Salt Lake City, Ut ah (circulation 111,000).

The Idaho State Journal, Pocatello, Idaho (circulation 20,000). Standard rate is $1 3.02 per column inch; charity rate is $7.88 per colum inch. Rates at magazines are going to fluctuate even more wildly, de- pending on the magazine's circ ulation and the size ad you buy. Check with the magazine's advertisi ng sales department to get cur- rent rates for the magazi nes you're interested in. Though buying ad time or space can be expensive, producing the ad will also cost you money. To he lp keep your advertising budget under control, tr y to find a local adve rtising agency that is willing to donate its creative services on a pro bono basis, either because it cares about your issue or wants to beef up its image as a socially conscious firm. But remember, even an agency that gives you free advice in writing ad copy and designing the spot will probably still charge you to produce the ad (to shoot and edit the videotape for a TV spot, to tape record an audio spot, or to de- sign and lay out a print spot). Be fore production begins, get a de- tailed budget on what it will cost , and make sure it is something vou can afford. Outdoor Advertising Everyone knows about Smokey th e Bear and McGruff, the trenchcoated dog determ ined to \"Take a bile out of crime.\" You may have seen these two mascots and their messages in public ser- vice announcements on television or in newspapers or magazines, but you are just as likely to have met them through an ad panel in the bus station or on a billboard. Outdoor or out-of-hom e advertising outlets— which also include subway stations, bus stop shelters, and telephone kiosks—are an effective but frequently overlooked option for both public service and paid advertisements—especia lly those designed to deliver quick, visual messages. The owners of outdoor advertising outlets, just like the manage- ment of print and broadcast media, will donate space to nonprofits and community groups when it is available—that is, when they"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"246 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS can't attract paid advertising fo r it. Sometimes the space is less than prime, or perhaps the advertising or media company is having a slow month or needs positive PR. (Billboard companies fre- quently donate space to public interes t groups, but there are some obvious environmental conflicts—see the discussion later in this section.) Usually, if you are given free space for an outdoor PSA. you must still pay to have the ad produced and installed or pasted into place. Outdoor ads that run at the same time as broadcast PSAs and carry the same image and/or text copy, can have more than twice the impact of either option alone: Hearing and seeing your organi- zation's name in two completely different contexts helps people re- member what you have to say. T RANSIT AND R ETAIL O UTLETS Many opportunities exist to post your message: • The exteriors and interiors of buses, on bus stop shelters and in bus stations. Of the country's 60.000 buses, 35,000 carry advertising. • Both inside and outside subway cars; in elevators; along es- calator corridors and walkways; and on the platforms of sub- way or train stations. The large, \"backlit\" panels you see in the stations are called dioramas. • Airport displays. • Mall displays, and ads in superm arkets, drug stores, and con- venience stores (ads are frequently seen on shopping carts or illuminated alongside a large public clock). • On telephone enclosures and outdoor kiosks belonging to ticket agencies, quick film developers, banks, and other busi- nesses. • In stadiums and other sports arenas, at ski resorts, and in movie theaters. Public gyms and health clubs, doctors' offices, and blood donor stations often provide framed wall space for health-related mes- sages. Other miscellaneous media forms available in some markets include painted walls, truck advertising, displays on college cam- puses and on military bases, air ba nner lowing, and rooftop taxi ads."},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"C OMMUNICATIONS 247 P AID O UTDOOR A DS If you can't convince a mass transit company or business to post a PSA, don't rule out purchasing th e space. As you will see in the next Local Hell-raiser story, outdoor advertising offers one way to spread your message that can gi ve you a big bang for your buck. (The Inland Empire activists act ually chose to purchase their busboards because their time-sensitive campaign could not rely on waiting for advertising leftovers.) Transit and other outdoor ads typically costs much less— considering the number of people reached, the longer display time and the potential for repeat view ings—than newspaper advertising or broadcast. Outdoor ads appear longer than newspaper ads and are more inexpensive to produce th an broadcast spots. The subway ads prepared for Friends of Merid ian Hill only set them back about $3,500 in production costs. For that , they got twelve large backlit ad panels. (The price included design and materials—labor was donated.) Some companies have contacts with a wide assortment of out- door advertising outlets and will h elp plan your entire promotional campaign, as well as negotiate and arrange the purchase of space. Outdoor Services, Inc., is the largest of these firms, with seven of- fices across the country. But such companies are expensive, espe- cially for small campaigns. You can do the work yourself by looking in the telephone directory under \"Advertising—Outdoor.\" Outdoor campaigns—whether using purchased or donated space—require the same planning as those designed for print or broadcast media.

Are they citydwellers or subu rbanites? What are their so- cioeconomic status and purchasi ng patterns? Also study the space available in your media mark et. The different boroughs of New York City, for example, of fer a wide variety of outdoor media opportunities: in Manha ttan, subway, bus, commuter trains, and urban panels are most available and effective; Staten Island, on the other hand, has abundant billboard space. • Is your objective to reach a broad range of people once, or a more targete d group repeatedly? Choose your medium accordingly: An airport ad panel reaches many travelers, but it will only be seen once or twice. A subway ad re aches many of the same riders every day. • Decide how long you want your campaign to run, depend- ing on the way different outlets are scheduled. Supermarket ads are sold or donated in four-we ek cycles, truck panel ads for six months or a full year.

Your city's mass transit department may not want its buses plastered with graphic depictions of animal tes ting or abortion. Your cause may be controversial, but your image doesn't have to be. • Although outdoor ads are less expensive than broadcast spots, factors such as weatherproofing, lighting, size, and full-color processing make their production complicated and costly.

Organizations such as Scenic America, a nati onal group based in Washington, DC, is among the organizations stri ving to restrict or ban bill- boards along roads and highways in many states. Scenic America's Frank Vespe notes that billboard in dustry lobbyists are always on the lookout for social interest groups—especially environmental- ists—who use billboards so the in dustry can showcase this usage and promote its cause by saying: \"S ee. public interest group X is in favor of billboards!\" Beware of billboard companies that gladly give up free space and ask for a le tter of thanks or support in re- turn; that letter may be used by th e company or by lobbyists to bal- lyhoo billboards. Using billboards for advertising or PSAs will also make it difficult for you to join any local efforts opposing more offensive activities of the b illboard industry, such as cutting down trees to improve bi llboard visibility or ca rrying alcohol or to- bacco ads aimed at young people. While it is easy to sympathize with Scenic America's argument, environmental and other organizati ons may not want to reject out of hand billboards as a potentia l communications medium—though you can still oppose the construction of new billboards. They just need to weigh the tradeoffs. Dave Crandall and the Inland Empire Public Lands Council produced ar resting but tasteful billboards that complimented other outdoor ads in a striking campaign to pro- test clearcutting in Washington State's Colville National Forest. Crandall said that even environm ental groups in the state over- whelmingly supported the campai gn's creativity, although some noted that they wouldn't launch a similar campaign because they disapproved of billboards. \"Wheth er we lik e it or not. billboards are there and they are a form of advertisement.\" he said.

Tell It Like It Is In a slate like Washington, on an issue like clear-cut logging, it's not hard to be outspent or outmaneuvered, particularly when you're an underfunded environmental organization and your nemesis is the well-heeled timber industry. So the Inland Empire Public Lands Council was put- ting a lot at risk when it launched a five-phase cam- paign to educate Tom Foley, a U.S. Representative from Washington State and the powerful Speaker of the House, about the need to pr otect Colville National For- est from logging practices that could reduce the majestic stands of ancient limbers to a clear-cut tract of barren land. Dave Crandall, executive dir ector of the council, a nonprofit group working to protect forests in northern Idaho and eastern Washington, described Colville as one of the worst managed forests in the entire country, in re- sponse to a slick industry advertising campaign intended to reassure the public that th e timber industry was envi- ronmentally conscious. \"We wanted to get the true message out,\" said Crandall.

Outdoor advertising, besides being an obvious choice for a forest preservation cam paign, allowed the council to use its strong grass roots volunteer base.

Outdoor ads would also enable the council to reach many Spokane residents while staying within its limited budget—all the while assuming that in retaliating the in- dustry would outspend them ten to one.

According to the billboard vendor roughly 139,000 people saw at least one of the billboards du ring that time. The cost ($4,300), Crandall remembered, was less than a one- page, one-hit ad in the Spokane Spokesman-Review, the city's daily newspaper—whic h, for $5,400. would have reached only 101,000 people. Also in May, 250 volunteers hung 40,000 door hangers—bearing the same im age as the billboard—in one day. \"We just blanketed th is place.\" Crandall said. Television crews gathered fo r a speech at the council's office, then followed the do or hangers on their routes. The council invited the media to attend or cover each component of the campaign, tr ying to get as much free media as possible. On August 11, the ad wa s posted on busboards and traveled more than half the bus routes in Spokane for the next month, at a cost of about $3,000. Grass roots help was again called upon when the council launched a postcard campaign, repea ling the image and message and asking concerned citizens to mail the cards to Con- gress, where legislation was in the works to save ancient forests. Mid-August also saw counc il volunteers knocking on door after door, asking people to display the clear-cut ad—which the council had printed on yard signs—on their lawns. By this time, Crandall said, everyone had seen the ad somewhere and was aware of the problem: People passing through neig hborhoods stopped the ac- tivists in the streets, wanting signs for their yards. The team installed a thousand sign s in a single weekend, and was able to place fifty-three of them on one of the city's busiest streets. The timber industry resp onded by buying up the same billboard space in the following months and run- ning its own ad (that showed a young forest and read \"The National Forests: A L egacy of Caring\"). And in- dustry employees systematically drove pickup trucks through neighborhoods and removed yard signs."},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"C OMMUNICATIONS 253 But the campaign's impact on the public and the leg- islature had already been made. The offices of Speaker Foley and Washington Senator Brock Adams were flooded with calls from citizens concerned about the clear-cutting. Foley, after fl ying over Colville to view the barren stumps and discarded timber the clear-cutters had left behind, approached the House Appropriations Committee and secured money for an inventory of old- growth trees in Colville. due to be completed in 1994; a health study of eastern Oregon and Washington for- ests, which found the trees to be ailing: and an analysis designed to recommend a ne w management system for those forests, also to be completed in 1994. Although the council won't take full credit, Crandall felt that blanketing Spokane with star k photos of the devastation undeniably helped persuade Speaker Foley to take some action. Interview Shows Practically every radio and television station produces a talk show or community service program that airs at least once a week. The shows will either be live, taped in advance and edited, live with phone-ins. or interviews via phone. Some stations also take portions of a taped interview and use them in news or feature seg- ments throughout the week. In many regards, you treat interview shows the same way you treat reporters who cover news beats. You keep lists of the shows and who their producers and hosts ar e. Popular shows in big media markets will have a producer (som etimes called a \"booker\") who books guests for the hosts. Programs in smaller media markets may be arranged entirely by th e person who hosts the show. Send information in advance—a cover letter explaining what the issue is and who you're recommending as a guest, and a press kit describing the issue in greater deta il. The press kit should also in- clude a one-page biographical profile establishing your guest's cre- dentials. Just as you need to convince an assignment editor that the topic is newsworthy, you'll have to convi nce the booker or host that the topic is current and that your gues t will be relevant and entertain- ing to the show's audience."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"254 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS • • STEP BY STEP • • How to Book a Talk Show Interview • Contact the person at the sh ow responsible for booking interviews.

The materials should include a cover letter expl aining what the issue is, the expert you're recommending, and a press kit describing the is- sue in greater detail. The kit should also include a one-page bio- graphical profile that establishes your spokesperson's credentials and a written set of questions for the interviewer to consider asking. • Call back to schedule the appearance. If the booker is not interested in your spokesperson, find out why. If your spokes- person is scheduled for an appear ance, find out if anyone else will be joining him or her. • Before the appearance, arrang e to provide the audience with the address and phone number of your group.

For both print and broadcast repo rters, captivating quotes and zinging one-liners are more likely to be used than lengthy explana- tions and lackluster discussion. Punchy lines and quotable phrases are a favorite of all reporters. How can you insure your quote is quotable? • Avoid jargon. Give specific examples that your audience can relate to. • Use analogies.

Before granting an interview requ est, familiarize yourself with the type of outlet your interview will be in.

Then work w ith your group's media committee"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"C OMMUNICATIONS    257 to determine how to characterize your issue in a way that will gen- erate the most empathy from that audience and motivate it to act. Understanding the reporter's personality is also important. To the extent possible, get to know a little about your interviewer be- fore the interview takes place. Watch or listen to the program you're going to be on in advance; if you're going to be talking with print reporters, read a few of their columns or stories first. P REPARE FOR THE I NTERVIEW Before the interview ta kes place, decide wh at you want your over- all message to be; know what you want to say and how you want to say it. Anticipate questions (especially difficult ones) and have an- swers ready. And rehearse, but not too much—you want to be re- laxed and confident, not robotic a nd spouting clearly rehearsed lines. Line up supporters in advance of the interview who can both at- test to the viability of your ar guments and pose questions typical of those the other side would raise. Be ready with sharp answers that bolster your position a nd deflate the opposition. ----------------------- The Interview Checklist --------------------------- __ Always be honest and forthright—don't conceal in- formation. If you don't know the answer to a question, say so. Then get back to the reporter with the informa- tion as soon as possible. — Never answer a question you don't understand. Ask the reporter or host to restate it. — Be concise. Long answers are often ineffective, unless you are giving background for a print interview. — Be informative, accurate, and helpful. Be consistent. A seasoned reporter can eas ily tell when you are fudging facts and figures. Try not to be argumentative or defen- sive. — Use news to create news. Try to relate your message to news of the day. — Avoid distractions. Rapid hand movements, repeatedly clearing your throat, foot tapping, eye rolling, and re- peated use of \"you know\" and \"uh\" can be very discon- certing. — Don't forget that being nervous is normal. Try to re- direct your fear into excitement and enthusiasm."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"258 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS _ Use humor during the interview to lighten the tone. Making people smile helps th em connect with you in a more personal way, making you seem less distant. _ Don't forget that you are the message. Focus your words, voice tone, facial ex pressions, and body language. Get to interviews early so that you can get a sense of the ques- tions the reporter is planning to as k. Take along a \"cheat sheet\" to help you keep track of points you want to make and facts or fig- ures you don't want to confuse. If, after the interview, you discover you gave the reporter some incorrect information, call him or her and correct your mistake. Thank reporters with a quick phone call or note if they do run a positive story or program. Always remember that, like you. reporters are just people trying to do their job. When possible, he lp them do the best that they can by supplying useful information and resources. If a story contains inaccuracies, politely correct them in a letter or phone call and continue to try to build a produc tive relationship with the reporter that will result in a bett er story next time around. T AKE C HARGE OF THE I NTERVIEW Just because you have agreed to an interview doesn't mean you have waived your right to cour tesy and respect. Here are some ground rules to help you take charge of the situation. • Ask about the show's format. Is it taped or live? Will there be a studio audience? Will there be call-in questions from the public, and will they be screened? Can answers be lengthy, or must you hold to a short, \"hard news\" format? What kind of questions will be asked? Will other guests be on at the same time? In what order of appearance? How long will your interview last? If it is a live show, you probably will be given an approximate ti me: if it is taped, you have the right to know how much of your interview will be used. Knowing the length of the interview ahead of time helps you prepare appropriate answers to questions you anticipate. • Know what you want to say. If your goal is to promote a program or particular point of view, steer the conversation to your issues before time runs ou t. Be prepared. Take notes"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"C OMMUNICATIONS S59 with you on the set or to an interview (but don't read from them on the air; it will make you look like you don't really know what you're talking about). Speak up. Don't wait for the interviewer to ask the ques- tions that will lead to the message you wish to deliver. Take advantage of a pause in the interview to make your points. If you are interrupted before you have had a fair chance to answer the question, you have a right to complete the an- swer. Do so politely, but firmly. Remember: Your duty is not to follow in whatever direction a reporter wants to head, but to convey the message you have chosen through the reporter. • Use visual materials. Slides, film clips, photos, charts, and videotapes are often welcomed by producers, who like to en- hance their shows with visual variety. • Monitor the reporter's \"reserv e\" or \"cutaway\" questions. Since most broadcast interviews are shot with one camera, reporters tape their questions for the camera's benefit after the interview is completed. Later, the questions are edited into the interview to give the impression two cameras were used. Sometimes, a reporter changes his questions from those you were actually asked. If you have any reason to be- lieve that the reporter may misrepresent you when he or she tapes the cutaway questions, ask the reporter in a low-key way if you can watch while the questions are being taped. Object should those questions differ from the ones you were asked during the actual interview. • Obtain a videotape copy of what was aired. Take a VHS tape with you to the studio if you would like them to make a duplicate on the spot. Radio stations may be willing to pro- vide you with a cassette of the program. Also, many cities have private media monitoring services that will tape any show on the air if you contac t them ahead of time and tell them when it will be on. A ch eaper alternative is to ask someone in your office or family to tape the show. \"O FF THE R ECORD \"--S HOULD Y OU O R S HOULDN ' T Y OU ? The best rule of thumb is very simple: When it comes to media interviews, there is no such thing as off the record. There should be no item under discussion that can't be on the record (or, as Jan"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"260 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS Garton put it: \"Never say anything you don't want to see in the pa- per\"). In fact, when dealing with a reporter you are much better off by assuming that anything you say can end up in the newspaper or on a program—so speak and act accordingly. There are no \"social occasions\" for reporters; you're always fair game. The best way to handle off-thc-reco rd interviews is simply never to give them. But if you must fo r some reason go off the record, be very explicit with the repor ter about the exact ground rules under which you are providing information. The chances for get- ting ''burned\" are great: You must establish exactly what kind of information you are providing. Here is a brief rundown on several of the off-the-record terms you sh ould clarify with the reporter: • Background briefing. A briefing provided only for the re- porter's education, to offer ge neral background that will help the reporter cover the story or subject. The material in this briefing is probably not inte nded for immediate publication or airing. Some or all of the material may be confidential and off the record. • Deep background. A briefing or interview intended to be used as part of a story. However, the source of the informa- tion, either by name or organization, may not be attributed to the story. Often, no quotes are allowed. • Not for attribution. A briefing or interview in which the source's name may not be used but everything else is on the record. • On the record. The best interview of all. When in doubt, al- ways speak on the record. So You're Going to Be on the Air S PECIAL T IPS FOR B ROADCAST I NTERVIEWS While most people view interviews with print reporters as fun or challenging, the notion of bein g on camera or live on the air can still strike fear in the heart of even seasoned spokespeople. There's"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"C OMMUNICATIONS 261 something about being under the li ghts that can reduce an eloquent and articulate person into a babb ling mess; it's called stage fright. Fortunately, the more such interviews you do, the easier it be- comes, and veteran spokespeople act ually use stage fright to their advantage: a little bit of nervousness can heig hten your presenta- tion and make you more en thusiastic and exciting. There are some excellent remedi es for stage fright. One is knowing your subject—and knowin g it well. The most articulate speaker will be a poor interviewee unless he or she knows the sub- ject inside and out. Another is to focus on the repo rter or host who is conducting the interview. Don't think about th e viewers or audience; visualize yourself in an intervie w situation with a sing le individual who is interested in what you have to say. Here are some specific tips to keep in mind when you are going to be on the air: • KISS (keep it short and simple). Even if your appearance is live and unedited, long rambli ng answers will put your au- dience to sleep. When your inte rview is to be edited for a news show or documentary, try to keep answers to seven to fifteen seconds. • Listen and wait. Make sure you understand the question be- fore you answer. If you need to think about your answer for a moment, do so. If the interv iew is being taped and you're unhappy with your answer to a question, start over. • Don't get angry. If you don't like a question, pause before you jump into a hot retort. If it's asked on a live show, slate simply that the question is unfair or that the tone makes it difficult to have a productive di scussion. Then make a point you want to make. • Be alert. Assume that a camera or tape recorder will be on at all times, anywhere in the studio. Don't say anything, even jokingly, that you don't want to come back to haunt you. Once you get to the studio, let th e producers do all the fussing. They'll show you to your seat, adjust your microphone, and ask you to say a few words to adjust sound levels. • Sit upright in your seat, leaning slightly forward. • Look at your interviewer—no t the camera—throughout the interview. • Use your hands within reason, an d don't be afraid of man-"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"262 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS nerisms, but avoid fussy, nervous, or exaggerated move- ments. • Glance at your notes if you need them for reference, but don't read from them. T ELEVISION T IPS • Moderate gestures help make you interesting. Smiling, pointing, and nodding are good devices when used sparingly to drive home a major point. • Everything you do will be magnified. Sit still: don't swivel in your chair, scratch your h ead, or wiggle your legs back and forth. • Act as if you are on camera at all times. You may think someone else is being pictured, but even if you see only one camera, there may be others. Don't slouch; do keep your feet together. • Be sincere and enthusiastic throughout. Try to stay ani- mated; otherwise you'll put viewers to sleep. • Dress carefully and conservatively. Women should: • Wear a simple tailored dress or a suit and blouse, free of fancy frills, in solid colors. • Avoid white or very light colo rs because they can produce a halo effect; black, navy blue, royal blue, and red are consid- ered best. • Avoid busy stripes and patterns that will draw attention to your clothes rather than to what you are saying. Large pieces of jewelry or sparkling jewels reflect studio lights and tend to flare and distort the picture. • Wear everyday makeup in natural tones. Men should: • Wear simple clothes. Gray, brown, or blue suits with off- white or pastel-colored shirts are fine. Stripes, checks, or sharply contrasting patterns should be avoided. • Choose ties and handkerchiefs in muted colors. Ties with large figures or designs appear too busy. • Select rings, tie clasps, and cuff links that do not sparkle or glint off studio lights."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"C OMMUNICATIONS 263 R ADIO T IPS • Focus on your words. Be very clipped and precise. Every \"uh\" and \"er\" is magnified on radio. Also, use a normal con- versational tone. Make listeners feel like you're talking to them. • Remember: You can't win them over with a smile. Ges- tures don't help either. Nodding yes or no is a waste of time, but a lot of people answer that way nonetheless. Sounding friendly on radio is very important, although it's harder to sound friendly than to be friendly. Smiling while you talk may help give you the right quality to your voice, but re- member it's the voice that counts. • Be personal. As far as the liste ner is concerned, you are sitting right in his or her living room or car. Don't shout; don't preach; don't give a speech. Use a gentle, conversational tone. Community Cable Access Cable television has been ins talled in more than 25,000 commu- nities around the United States, r eaching 60 percent of all U.S. households each year and giving activists access to yet another important communications tool. Each local cable system reserves at least one channel for non- commercial use by individuals and nonprofit organizations. Thou- sands of these cable access channels are available on more than 1,400 cable systems in the United States. Major cities like Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Tampa. Tucson, Atlanta, and Portland have sev- eral access channels, and there ar e more than 440 access channels in California alone. In fact, in some communities, ca ble television is delivered to more homes than the daily newspaper. Local cable systems usually have much to offer a citizens group. They provide a way for citizens to keep track of what is going on in their community itself, as the channel usually covers local school board meetings and other community events that are obvi- ously not carried on commercial television stations. Also, local cable systems are usually willing to loan their equip- ment and personnel to the public so that groups or individuals can make and air their own programs. In fact, many cable systems of-"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"26* T HE B UILDING B LOCKS fer training programs that certif y citizen producers for free or at very low cost. The public access channel offe red by the local system may be managed either by the local cable op erator, a school or community institution, or an independent nonp rofit corporation. The public ac- cess center might be based at the ca ble office, at the public library, in a school, or even in a loca l shopping mall. The public access center usually includes a televi sion studio, training and meeting rooms, and equipment storage an d checkout areas. Equipment. training and access time on the chann el are usually provided on a first-come, first-served basis. Even if you don't want to prod uce your own programs, you can use your public access channel to organize. Every system has at least one text channel, which co nveys information in words and numbers on the TV screen. The text channel acts as a sort of com- munity bulletin board. It lists co mmunity events, job openings, and other announcements. Notify your local cable system that you would like to submit a message for the community bulletin board. You may need to com- plete a form requesting a message of up to thirty or forty words: fill it in. mail or fax it back, and call to confirm that your message will run at least four times an hour for several days or a week. In addition to submitti ng your own text me ssages and producing your own programs, you can subm it preproduced programs or films to your cable system that furt her your issue. As long as they are of broadcast quality, and c ontain no obscene material, the station should run them. You can also appear on an access program or series if the sys- tem produces its own talk show. As with any promotional event, you'll want to target the pro- gramming you produce to the right audience. Build viewership by promoting your cable programs h eavily in the co mmunity newspa- per and in fliers posted in local shops and at the library. Whenever possible, feature local people in programs about important issues in the community. Most cable programs can be aired several times: make sure yours is, too.

Others, like \"Jus- tice for Kids\" and \"Laws for Kids.\" about the juvenile justice system, are being shown in high schools as well as by the Bucks County Prob ation Department as train- ing films. \"At Issue\" costs the League around $10,000 a year, money that is primarily spent advertising the program and buying videotape (produ ction facilities and equip- ment are free through the local cable systems). The sum seems large, but LWV has bee n able to secure grants from local businesses and some national corporations to help cover the costs of the program. Shirley Hart, chair of the Bucks County LWV chap- ter, believes that the cable sh ow's benefit in the commu- nity is apparent. \"Our prog ram called 'Poor and Sick in Bucks County' has been exceedingly significant in terms of expanding low-cost health facilities in the county. One hospital has given us credit for its entire change in policy,\" she said . And people are watching \"At Issue\" regularly: When one program wasn't aired for technical reasons, the station received calls from viewers seeking assurance th at it hadn't been dropped."},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"266 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS The chapter's latest project involves a new program and video called \"Raising Heal thy Children\" that pro- vides information on health resources available to the area's poor parents. Recogniz ing that school nurses are often the most accessible he alth care providers for many kids, a local branch of the Pennsylvania Nurses Associ- ation donated $500 for LWV to distribute a copy of the video to every school nurse in the county. Using Video If you do produce a program, d on't put it away after it's been televised a few times. Send it to s chools, use it for fund-raising, and urge elected officials to watch it. Indeed, many groups are foregoi ng films and slide shows alto- gether in favor of videos, showin g their programs before groups of activists, at public hearings and board meetings, and to individuals seated in their own homes. Some activists have been known to back a station wagon into a su permarket parkin g lot and run a VCR and TV off the car's cigarette lighter. Others rent booths at the local county fair and show vi deos while they are handing out fliers explaining their campaign. Enterprising organizations are ta king advantage of the relatively low duplication costs (sometimes on ly $3 per tape) to send out vid- eos the way they previously distri buted direct mail. Some groups transfer entire slide shows to vide otape; with over 90 percent of American households equipped with a VCR. they want to take ad- vantage of a ready medium to he lp them educate, communicate, and organize. Few community groups have the b udget to go on location and produce a state-of-the-art videota pe. But you don't need to look like \"60 Minutes\" to produce a video that w i l l meet your fund- raising and organizing needs. In fact, home video has become in- creasingly popular as a way to organize and inform. Some of the most powerful videos are thos e produced by amateurs. Remember the footage, shot on a home vi deo camera, that showed Rodney King being brutally beaten by fo ur Los Angeles police officers? The tape, though of extremely poor quality from a professional point of view, sparked a national in trospection on race relations in America and was admitted as evi dence when the police officers were put on trial.

Video News Releases A video news release (VNR) is the television version of a press release. Corporations, professional associations, government agen- cies, and lobbying groups often hire production or public relations firms to produce expensive pieces th at look and sound like part of the evening news. Ranging in le ngth from 90 seconds to 1 minute and 40 seconds, they're distributed to TV stations for free in hopes that they will be aired in local newscasts. The biggest drawback is that a piece like this must be profes- sionally produced at a cost of a bout $10,000. And even after you spend that kind of money, there' s no guarantee you'll get on the air. You're better off either going the home video route or convinc- ing a television station to produce its own piece. If you do opt for a slick VNR. make sure your tape includes ex- tra sound bites (interview segments) and \"b-roll (extra footage) so stations can edit the story to fit their particular format. Some sta- tions will have their own reporters write a new script and narrate the story over the footage you prov ide. Identify everyone speaking on camera, the sponsor of the VNR, and the reporter separate from the actual VNR so stations can see and use their own titles. Use news writers, producers, professi onal camera crews, and news an- nouncers to make the story look like \"real\" news. You can distribute your video news release on a cassette tape or via satellite if you have the budg et and you are aiming for national distribution. Either way, notify each station that the tape is coming"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"268 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS with a written telex to a specific individual, and follow up with a phone call. Newsletters Newsletters are primarily a comm unications tool intended to keep members of an organization apprised of what the organization is up to. They don't have to be slick and snazzy to be effective, though given the proficiency many activists now enjoy with com- puter graphics, many newsletters are at least nicely laid out and free of typos. They do need to co ntain essential information that makes readers and members feel that the organization is doing val- uable work, motivating reader s to become mo re involved. But beware! Consider newsletters public domain; don't include any information in them that you wouldn't want a reporter, office- holder or an opponent to read . .. and use against you. Use news- letters to boast about your work an d convey the strength of your position, not to debate strategy or reveal any weaknesses your group may have. Information should include highli ghts from any victories you've enjoyed, analysis of any defeats you've suffered, updates on activ- ities the organization has launche d, announcements about upcom- ing events or actions, and useful in sights into the issues the group is working on. Many ne wsletters also provide a letters-to-the-editor section so their members can write i n . As much as possible, the news letter should highlight your group's accomplishments, making members feel proud to belong and keeping volunteers mo tivated to do more. In addition to being an effective organizi ng tool, your newslette r can help you raise money by alerting members when a special fund-raising opportu- nity is about to come their way. Most grass roots groups publish their newsletter monthly or bi- monthly, although those on tighter budgets may opt for a quarterly or even semiannual publication. If you publish a newsletter, dist ribute it widely. Mail it to mem- bers, and make copies available in your local library and among various civic associations, schoo ls, and churches in your commu- nity.

Such a broad-based network may be terrific for reaching out to all sectors of the country , but it can be a nightmare when it comes to keeping chapters apprised of impor- tant information and aware of what various parts of the organization are up to. In early 1990, to ease communications among its chapters and with other s upporting organizations, the NCPCA began to tap into HandsNet, a nonprofit infor- mation and communications network that connects a broad range of human service organizations. A year later, while organizing a symposium for teen- age African Americans on male responsibility, the Greater Chicago chapter logged onto HandsNet during a brainstorming session and searched for the words \"male responsibility.\" To their surprise, they di scovered a social services agency in South Bend.

For four years after Anne Ma rie's death Ricci lived in a vacuum, not believing that t h i s tragedy had struck her family twice, that they had not learned from Ray's death to save her sister. In 1984, Ri cci saw an ad in the paper for a meeting of the activist group Remove Intoxicated Drivers (RID) in Southington. Connecticut. It was, she decided, time to attend. \"All I Knew How to Do Was Keep House and Raise Kids\" The Connecticut chapters of RID are branches of RID- USA, Inc., a 501(c)(3) or ganization and \"the only totally volunteer grass roots organization working na- tionally and effectively to reduce drunk driving,\" according to founder and president Doris Aiken. Aiken launched her ambitious campaign to make the roads sale in 1978 when two students—t he same ages as her own kids—in her hometown of Schenectady, New York, were killed by a drunk driver. \"We realized how quickly life can be obliterated for no reason,\" she said. Aiken started the original RID chapter and teamed up with several other anti-DWI organizations in New York to create the founding chapter s of RID. Though novices all, the activists succeeded in passing, for the first time, \"simple, reasonable laws\" combatting drunk driving at the state level. At a lobbying cost of under $200, thir- teen New York State laws were passed over two years, reducing deaths by drunk driver s 10 percent in the state in 1981.

She re- cruited volunteers by writing a press release, which got local coverage, and a column in the local paper urging people to come, learn, and help solve the problem. The Riccis also posted flyers a ll over town and talked among their friends. The public support they r eceived was astounding— the Riccis described it as a \"time bomb\" that went off in their hands. \"Most pe ople who knew Nancy wanted to help her out, \" J i m Ricci said.

In 1984, RID landed its first major legisla tive victory when the activ- ists passed a bill raising th e Connecticut drinking age to 21. A year later RID was instrumental in setting the blood alcohol content (BAC ) limit for legal drunkenness at .10. Both successes were secured by writing and calling legislators, attending hearings on the bills, and educating the public about the laws and the issue. In 1986, when th e president of RID Connecticut re- signed. Ricci was appointed her successor and RID Wallingford merged with the state group. A third chal- lenge sprang up shortly ther eafter. In the course of meeting with a Liquor Control Board agent to prepare for a hearing, RID discovered that these agents worked only during the day, not at night, when the liquor laws most needed to be enforced.

What makes this law effective is that the proceeding is an administrative hearing, overseen by the Depart- ment of Motor Vehicles, se parate from any court hear- ings related to the offense and therefore much more expeditious. Delays caused by court schedules and law- yers often allowed drunk driv ers to keep their licenses while awaiting trial. This bill would remove dangerous drivers from the streets wh ile expediting the legal pro- cess. The administrative per se law had significantly re- duced drunk driving deaths elsewhere—why not in Connecticut? Writer's Cramp Twenty-two states and the Di strict of Columbia already had the administrative per se law on their books when RID Connecticut began fighting to pass it, but that didn't make RID's job any ea sier. Ricci got a boost in 1986. when RID-USA held a workshop on administra- tive per se that described th e benefits of the law, and handed out a booklet writte n by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administrati on (NHTSA) explaining the law's technicalities and suggesti ng tactics to help get it passed. One of those tactics was to write letters, and write letters they did. Ricci encou raged everyone to write by hand—to every state legislat or (even the opposition). state agents, the governor, th e attorney general, the chief state attorney, judges, pros ecuting lawyers, and anyone else who might be remotely in terested in the bill and its progress, urging them to su pport the passage of admin- istrative per se. The activis ts cited success statistics from states such as Minneso ta, which has seen a 60 per- cent reduction in traffic/alc ohol fatalities that occur after midnight since its version of the law was implemented; they included newspaper ar ticles when possible. She photocopied editorials and sent them to legislators, al- ways scrawling an impassio ned note on the side, com- pelling the recipient to read and appreciate facts attesting to the law's effectiveness."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"288 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS In 1987, as RID was gaining momentum, the General Federation of Women's Clubs of Connecticut. Inc., adopted RID and the anti-DWI cause, offering them eighty-four chapters around the state from which to or- ganize. Suddenly RID had contacts all over Connecticut who could write or call their respective representatives right in their home districts. With Ricci serving as liai- son between RID and the federation, the two groups worked cooperatively—a \"united front,\" she called it— for two of the three years it took to pass administrative per se. Reaching Out RID helped mold public attitudes about DWI through a broad-based educational effo rt aimed at getting people to \"pass the keys\" when they have been drinking. \"Ed- ucation and awareness go hand in hand,\" Ricci said. RID volunteers researched and compiled fliers, book- lets, and brochures containing information about blood alcohol levels and DWI, whic h they distributed at fairs and conferences. The organization contacted the Board of Education and set up progr ams in local schools, even at the elementary level, where volunteers taught youths about the dangers of drunk driving, passed out litera- ture, and encouraged kids to tell their parents to pass the keys. Ricci, as state RID president, traveled throughout Connecticut, sometimes speaking six out of seven days a week. A \"pink elephant\" named Tipsy became RID's mas- cot and helped the chapter communicate with youths. Tipsy (a volunteer dressed in a specially made costume paid for by a car dealership) was the featured guest at RID's Drunk Driving Awareness Night, where commu- nity members and kids got t ogether at a local nightclub to dance, take advantage of nonalcoholic drink specials, and consider the risks stemming from drinking and driv- ing. The night had a lobbying purpose, too: a state sen- ator, local council members, and media celebrities drank \"real\" drinks to show how many—or few—it took to reach .10 percent BAC.

How the Media Helped In the meantime. RID's lobby ing activities for adminis- trative per se did not let up. The local media helped draw attention to RID's campaign by covering the orga- nization's activities liber ally, accompanying articles with boxed quotes such as \" 'We have no other choice.

More editorials ran when s eventy RID members showed up to testify before the stat e legislature and were sent home after four hours without being given a chance to speak. By this point, reporters we re calling Ricci when they needed statistics or an opin ion on any topic related to drunk driving; the activist co ntinued to contact the press each time the bill stalled in the legislature. The first time Ricci called a local radio station, she was asked to make a statement on the air. She told listeners to tele- phone their legislators and urge them to pass stricter anti-DWI laws. Thereafter, she became a frequent guest on local radio talk shows, and appeared as a guest on several TV programs as well, including the nationally syndicated \"Sally Jessy Raph ael Show,\" When a local TV station called her one New Year's Eve. Ricci got up from dinner with her family to meet with the reporter. who filmed her telling listen ers to drink responsibly and \"pass the keys\" to a sober friend. Again, it was Ricci's style to do extra research and legwork for reporters. She kept in constant contact with them, provided them w ith quick information, and thanked them for stories—no t to butter them up, Jim Ricci said, but because she co nsidered so many of them her friends. Yet while Ricci maintained the friendly rap- port with them that the fight sorely needed, she did not mince her words when speaking with reporters, and could always be counted on for a heartfelt, frank, and often heated comment. In additi on to frequent articles, newspapers ran pointed political cartoons focused on the problem and surveyed townsf olk as to whether people arrested for DW1 should have their licenses taken away. Though tightly budgeted, RID members found they still had to watch their spending carefully. The group paid just over $500 for an ad in the local paper promot- ing administrative per se an d attracted the attention of the state ethics commission.

A Champion in the House RID members showed up at the state capitol each time the administrative per se bill was debated to speak their case or simply make their presence known, telegraphing unequivocal signals about th eir dedication to the fight. Ricci had organized a loose coalition of organizations touched by the issue over th e years, and she called on that network regularly when she needed support, in word or deed, in fighting fo r or against legislation. Some weeks she pla ced a hundred calls to alert RID and coalition members to the legislative sessions and urge them to attend. More calls were necessary when RID had to scramble to adjust to last-minute legislative agen- da changes. Their lobbying trips hinged on information provided by the bill's diligent spon sor. Representative Prague. The main proponent in Connecticut for not only this but all drunk driving legislation, Edith was Nancy's equal in energy, stubbornness, and co mmitment to combat DWI, for her twenty-one -year-old niece had been killed in 1980 by a drunk driver who went free. \"You have to have one contact that you can really count on, who will stick their neck out.\" observ ed J i m Ricci. \"Other legis- lators promised, but didn't ca ll. Edith is one of the few I have total re spect for.\" The feisty legislator \"grabbed on like a bulldog and wouldn't let go,\" remember ed Jim Ricci. She lobbied for the administrative per se bill among her colleagues, called the Riccis whenever the legislation was slated for discussion at a hearing or committee meeting, and kept them generally informed ab out its progress behind closed doors. Sometimes, the going got pretty rough. One state representative stood up during a debate and gave Edith (who is Jewish) the \"Heil, Hitler\" salute; a"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"292 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS state senator rudely declared that administrative per se \"would never be passed as long as Nancy Ricci is fight- ing for it!\" Ricci built a valuable resource group upon whom she called for information to bolster her lobbying efforts. A local doctor provided RID with health care information and spoke out forcefully in favor of RID's positions; NHTSA and the National Transportation Safety Board offered a steady flow of facts and figures. Even sympa- thetic workers in the mailrooms of legislative offices helped, allowing Ricci to drop off her letters with names only, no addresses or stamps, and then placing them in the correct boxes. They Won! Eventually, the activists' pe rseverance, hard work, and the enormous public support they had drummed up paid off. Final approval for the administrative per se bill was won with a unanimous vote in June of 1989, three years after its initial proposal. In a state where the average blood alcohol content of convicted drunk drivers was .18, the equivalent of ten to fifteen drinks, a major ordi- nance was finally put in place to try to deter people pulled over for DWI from drinking and driving again. The law's success in removing drunk drivers from Connecticut's roads has been substantial. In 1989, al- most no drivers lost their licenses for a DWI offense; in 1990, almost all those accuse d of DWI did—a total of 1.657 drivers relinquished their right to drive for ninety days and 622 had to settle for the passenger's side for six months. Ricci's eight-year reign as president of RID Connect- icut was dotted by additional legislative triumphs, as RID continued to eliminate opportunities for citizens to drink, drive, and get away with it. The group helped pass a law that closed a l l bars at the same hour and de- feated an effort to push back that hour. They also fought to change the labeling of a deceivingly potent wine cooler whose alcohol content was 20 percent; proposed an anti-DWI postage stamp; helped persuade the state to open a prison in Windsor, Connecticut, exclusively for repeat drunk driving offenders : and, in November 1992,"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"L OBBYING 293 convinced the nationally syndi cated Maury Povich show to feature a couple whose sixteen-year-old daughter died from binge drinking. Don't Be Afraid RID's story offers a remarkable example of how people who are initially outside the system can get involved, influence others, and effect change. Jim Ricci attributes RID's effectiveness largely to Nancy's instinct: She was not afraid of doing \"the wrong thing\"; all that mattered to her was fighting to save lives. The Riccis faced deep- seated opposition from their state government: Family members of the chairman of the ordinance committee owned a restaurant in Wallingford; an assistant attorney who was found drunk and sl umped over his steering wheel in a running parked car was not suspended; the governor was a former bar owner. Still, the couple pressed on. The lack of burea ucracy in the RID network attracted and kept advocates like Edith Prague moti- vated. And the organization's success in remaining true to its grass roots effectively inculcated in policymakers a sense of responsibility fo r helping to stop drunk driv- ers. \"Nine years ago Nancy probably couldn't have told you the name of her governor,\" her husband Jim said, \"let alone how to push a bill through the state legisla- ture.\" But lack of organizi ng and political experience clearly did not stop Nancy and her band of activists. In fact, says Jim Ricci: \"One of the reasons we were so successful is that we didn't ask anyone what to do or whether we should do it, we just did it.\" \"People can't be afraid to speak up and get things ac- complished.\" said Nancy Ricci. \"Anyone could do what we did. You just have to be lieve in what you are doing.\""},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"29* T HE B UILDING B LOCKS WHAT IS LOBBYING? As New York Times columnist William Safire has observed, the practice of \"lobbying\"—i n which citizens, intere st groups, or their representatives seek to influenc e the action on proposed laws by meeting directly with legislators— probably is as old as lawmaking itself. According to Safire's Political Dictionary, however, the term \"lobbying\" did not enter our lan guage until the mid-1600s. when a large anteroom near the floor of the British House of Commons in London became known as \"the lobby,\" a place where legislators would gather when not debating me asures before the House. Peo- ple who wanted a word with memb ers of Parliament could meet them there. In this country, the posh and ve nerable Willard Hotel in Wash- ington, DC. just a few blocks from the White House, likes to say it gave a boost to the term \"lobby ing\" during the administration of Ulysses S. Grant, the Union Army general and Civil War hero who was president from 1869 to 1877. President Grant was known to relax from the rigors of office by strolling over to the Willard and sitting in its lobby to have a br andy or two an d smoke cigars. \"Many would-be power brokers approached him on individual causes and he called th ese people 'lobbyists,'\" according to the of- ficial history of the Willard, whic h traces its own lineage to hotels that have occupied its same site since 1816. After Daniel Willard purchased the property in 1850. he quickly turned his hotel into an importan t social and political location—so much so that author Nathaniel Hawthorne, vi siting the Willard dur- ing the Civil War. wrote that the hotel \"may be m uch more justly called the center of Washington an d the Union than either the Cap- itol, the White House, or the State Department.\" Today, any communication with an elected federal, state, or lo- cal representative, or his or her st aff, for the purpose of influencing legislation, an appointment, a resolution, a referendum, a constitu- tional amendment, or an initiative is considered lobbying. Personal contact, a telephone call, a letter, a telegram, or a fax all may be considered lobbying if they are sent to legislators (or their staffs) with the intention of influenci ng the way they vote. And while these actions can certainly take plac e in the lobby of a swanky ho- tel, they're just as likely to occu r from an activist's home, a church basement, or in the legislator's own office. For many Americans, lobbying has an unsavory sound to it,"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"L OBBYING 295 connoting an underhanded way of gaining special or even exces- sive favors from the government. But citizen lobbyists who partic- ipate in the political process th rough lobbying can play a critical role in protecting the public interest. Indeed, lobbying is frequently the only course open to activists committed to obtaining just laws and fair treatment on their issues . As one citizen lobbyist once put it, lobbying can be a weapon as we ll as a shield for both sides of any issue. WHY LOBBY? When you lobby, you take advantage of one of the most dem- ocratic tools available to you to bring about change. You also provide a much-needed service to legislators who don't have the time (or perhaps the inclination) to become experts on every issue that concerns you and the people you represent. Cit- izen lobbyists offer valuable assist ance to legislators, public offi- cials, the media, and the general public by compiling accurate information on complex or provoca tive subjects while supplying the ammunition needed to defeat counterproductive proposals. By communicating with your elected officials throughout the process of drafting, debating, and enacti ng legislation on your issue, you greatly increase the chances that laws and regulations will meet your needs. Lobbying is a tough, highly comp etitive business, and it's cer- tain that you will win only some of the fights you undertake. But whether you win or lose, the expe rience should allow you to par- ticipate more effectively in the legislative process when the next opportunity arises. And there will be other opportunities, for as certain as it is that the gavel will drop to convene a new legislative session every year, there will be a next time for you to urge con- sideration of issues important to you. CAN YOU LEGALLY LOBBY? Two forms of lobbying are commonly recognized: direct lobby- ing and indirect lobbying. Direct lobbying involves personal con- tact with the members or staff of a legislative body, or a government employee who participates in the legislative process, in an effort to encourage them to introduce, support, oppose, re- peal, or otherwise influence legisl ation. Indirect, or grass roots, lobbying encourages individual me mbers of the public to write."},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"296 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS telephone, or otherwise contact legisl ators, their staffs, or particu- lar government employees and persuad e them to take action with respect to specific legislation. A letter you write to your senator urging support for the Family and Medical Leave Act constitutes direct lobbying. A mailing you send to members of your organiza- tion, asking them to write to their senators about th e act. qualifies as grass roots lobbying. Under the provisions of the 1976 Tax Re- form Act. nonprofit groups are a llowed to engage in both kinds of lobbying, with certain restrictions. A 501(c)(3) organization (one that is classified by the Internal Revenue Service as both nonprofit and capable of receiving tax- deductible contributions) is pe rmitted to lobby without endan- gering its tax status so long as the lobbying effort does not make up a \"substantial part\" of the organization's total activity. In order to stay within this limit, an or ganization must determine whether a particular activity qualifies as \"l obbying.\" and how much of the or- ganization's total activity may be directed toward lobbying. Courts have ruled that a \"substantial part\" of lobbying expenditures must amount to less than 5 percent of the organization's total annual ex- penditures. However, a 501(c)(3) organizatio n may elect to spend more of its budget on lobbying activities by filing its intention to do so with the Internal Revenue Service. The amount that an organiza- tion may spend on lobbying without inclining a penalty is called the \"Lobbying Nontaxable Amount.\" The IRS measures an organization's Lobbying Nontaxable Amount by adding together 20 per cent of an organization's first $500,000 of total operating expendi tures; 15 percent of its sec- ond $500,000 of expenditures; 10 pe rcent of its third $500,000 of expenditures; and 5 percent of a ny remaining expenditures, as long as total lobbying ex penditures do not exceed $1,000,000 in any one year. No more than 25 percen t of total lobby ing expenditures may be spent on grass roots lobbying. What does all this legalese me an? Consider this example: If your organization has a budget of $100,000 a year, you may elect to spend up to $20,000 a year on salaries, postage, printing, and other expenses incurred in the course of direct lobbying. You may not spend more than 25 percen t of that $20,000—or $5,000—on grass roots lobbying. Failure to observe these guideli nes may cause the IRS to levy fines or taxes, revoke your tax-exempt status, or both. The Federal Regulation of Lobby ing Act (FRLA) requires indi-"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"L OBBYING 297 viduals and organizations lobbyi ng the U.S. Congress on legisla- tion to register and report thes e activities. An organization that plans to lobby the Congress should ask the Secretary of the Senate or Clerk of the House about registration and reporting require- ments. Many states have similar registration and reporting require- ments for lobbying activities in the state legislature. Information regarding these requirements generally is available from the office of your state's Secretary of State. If you have created a 501(c)(4) organization specifically to lobby or otherwise engage in political activities (remember, a 501(c)(4) is exempt from paying federal income tax but contribu- tions and membership dues are not tax deductible), your group may conduct unlimited lobbying ac tivities without jeopardizing your tax-exempt status, provided the legislation that you are at- tempting to influence pertains to the purpose for which your group was formed. For example, an organization devoted to reforming health care may spend unlimited funds to promote legislation to nationalize health insurance, but not to advance a bill that would increase the budget for the Environmental Protection Agency. \"Safe\" Legislative Activities If you are a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt or ganization, here is a list of the kinds of legislative activities in which you may engage without endangering your tax status: • Provide technical advice. You may respond to written re- quests from a legislative comm ittee or body to testify or provide advice on legislation. Requests you solicit, and ap- pearances you make withou t a written request, will be considered direct lobbying. • Distribute nonpartisan informational materials to all leg- islators as well as to the general public. • Invite public officials to a ttend meetings or otherwise be- come informed about your issue without attempting to influence votes (as long as you invite officials of all political parties). • Lobby on your own behalf. This so-called \"self-defense\""},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"298 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS lobbying must deal with issues that may affe ct the existence of your organization or your tax-exempt status. • Communicate with your own members. You may tell your members about legislation provi ded you don't ask them to do something specifically about it. . Work on regulations. Once a bill has been passed, you may work to help draft regulations to implement and enforce the legislation. • Lobby on a volunteer basis. You may lobby an elected of- ficial as an individual, rather than as a representative of your group, provided you are not reimbursed for expenses in- curred in doing so. THE ELEMENTS OF AN EFFECTIVE LOBBYING CAMPAIGN Michael Pertschuk, who was appoi nted chairman of the Federal Trade Commission by Pr esident Carter in 1 977 and now works for the Advocacy Institute in Washingt on. DC. as a citizen lobbyist, noted in his book The Giant Killers: \"The basic ground rule in public interest lobbying is to find something that is not just winnable on its own terms but has the capacity to have a rippling effect ... we have to choose our battles.\" In other words, since we do not have the resources to fight ev- ery fight, we must pick our confro ntations carefully, and hope that the ones we pick—and win—will lead to subsequent victories on other issues. An effective lobbying campaign takes many twists during the legislative process. It can influen ce the choices legislators and their committees make about the issues they champion, shape bills be- fore they are introduced, affect the way hearings are held, influ- ence the \"mark up\" sessions in which amendments are considered and the content of bills evolves. Your lobbying efforts can also af- fect the timing of votes by the fu ll legislative body, sway the con- ference committees in wh ich senators and representatives meet to resolve differences between th eir two houses, and influence whether a mayor, governor, or th e president signs the legisla- tion—or vetoes it. The lobbying process can take months, years, even decades. Rarely does a law ge t conceived, written, amended, and passed in"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"LOBBYING 299 the same legislative session—sometimes the session is just too short (especially in those states where the legislature meets for only ninety days each year!); fre quently, it takes days and even months for competing interests to work out their differences, or for one side to muster the resources necessary to emerge victorious. And legislators themselves have elevated the science of procrasti- nation to an art. Sometimes it s eems that the procedural rules gov- erning the way a bill becomes law are designed to actually prevent the bill from becoming law. The reluctance of many legislators to want to be pinned down to a position or a vote, particularly on a controversial topic, combined with the sizable investment required to build a coalition, mobilize the media, recruit co-sponsors, and take other essential steps, all c onspire to make lawmaking a very time-consuming process. Where Should You Start? Though the point of a lobbying cam paign is to influence legis- lators, most lobbying efforts begin long before a vote is cast. Like Connecticut's RID, this Indiana group began working years in ad- vance to build coalitions, prepare position papers, and generate widespread public support for its leg islation. Its strategy paid off in victory. The Indiana Home Care Task Force If you were a senior citizen, what concern would be ut- most in your mind? When the Indiana Health Care Campaign in the summer of 1985 asked senior Hoosiers that very question, they were stunned by the replies. An overwhelming 90 percent of the stale's elderly re- sponded that their greatest fear was institutionaliza- tion—being put in a nursin g home. Campaign members were floored; many had ag ing parents themselves who would soon be needing extr a health care. What could they do to convince the state le gislature to pass laws se- curing a healthy future for Indiana's elderly? The Campaign, a coalition of th irty senior citizen, re- ligious, labor, a nd human service organizations, had"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"300 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS been working since 1984 toward a more progressive health care program for th e state. The activists em- barked on an ambitious effort to draft appropriate legis- lation and search out key lawmakers to sponsor it. The Citizen's Action Coalition of Indiana (CAC) and United Senior Action (USA), advocates well-known for other health-related lobbying battles they had waged, helped research and write the bill. CAC legislative di- rector John Cardwell coordina ted the lobbying effort on their behalf. Soon the people's support for home care laws began turning into grass roots manpo wer. By April 1986, forty organizations, including the Campaign, the American Association of Retired Pers ons (AARP), Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, United Cerebral Palsy, United Sen- ior Action, and the state Nurses Association had formed a larger coalition—the Indi ana Home Care Task Force. During the 1986 General As sembly, this first home care bill was amended to pr ovide for a commission to investigate the problem. Task force members lobbied hard to gel \"their people\" sealed on the commission: Experts from different affili ated agencies testified at hearings, while volunteers met with officials face-to- face and wrote to the gove rnor, who was in charge of appointing citizens to the commission . Such pressure tactics paid off; many i ndividuals who were asked to serve on the commission were friendly to consumer- oriented health care programs. Indiana legislators found th emselves learning about home care for the elderly whether they liked it or not: The forty well-established or ganizations, many of which were branches of national networks, were hard to ig- nore, especially when th eir members kept calling and sending letters! The task fo rce had shaped the composi- tion of the commission, but s till had to lobby to steer its recommendations in the right direction. To the group's satisfaction, the commission proposed a bill that was modeled after a Wisconsin home care program. Indiana's program, dubb ed Community and Home Options to Institutional Care for the Elderly and Dis- abled, or CHOICE, would utilize case managers from area agencies on ag ing who could work with elderly cli-"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"L OBBYING 301 ents to design a package of at -home care services to suit their needs, and a cost-share plan to make care afforda- ble. The services could include the provision of health aides, transportation, com panions, and other activities, all designed to k eep the individual at home, comfort- able, and independen t. Home care saves seniors the in- flated costs of nursing ho mes, for which Medicare and private insurance payments are usually inadequate. Opposition to the home care bill swelled up from the state's Budget Agency, but the increasingly visible grass roots supporters stood fast. The task force had become a favorite of the media and enjoyed substantial state and local coverage of the press conferences it held at the statehouse and of the rallies it organized. The senior cit- izens proved to be enthus iastic demonstrators whose events made for great photo opportunities. In one partic- ularly eye-catching action, 150 seniors leaned over the balcony on the third floor of the statehouse and unrolled a scroll containing the signat ures of 9,000 older Hoo- siers who supported the CHOICE bill. The scroll reached the floor of the st atehouse rotunda—a full two stories long! Legislators gaped at the sheer numbers who were demanding a home care program, while press photographers snapped pictures furiously. Despite officials who prot ested spending state money on any sort of human service, the task force was able to engage sympathizers from m any different camps. \"Be- cause the response from the seniors was so overwhelm- ing, we decided early on that it would be hard to find an adult who didn't have to ca re for an aging relative,\" Cardwell said. Party affilia tion was not an issue: the goal was to build a cadre of supporters so numerous and diverse that they'd be im possible to ignore when they arrived in the capitol to lobby legislators. The activists approached leade rs of agencies such as the Chamber of Commerce who historically had op- posed this type of govern ment expenditure. \"Have you ever had a family member in need of extra care?\" Chamber representatives were asked. The task force urged those who had experie nced the challenge of car- ing for an elderly relative to pledge their neutrality in the battle."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"302 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS The Indiana Home Care Task Force taped together a two-story curtain of petitions, full of signatures from advocates of the CHOICE bill,  and draped it over the railing at the state capitol.

HOW TO LOBBY, STEP BY STEP As the activists' experience in passing the home care bill showed, lobbying involves more th an personal contact with legis- lators and showy media events at the capitol. Persuading influential people in relevant public and priv ate agencies to back your efforts is vital. John Cardwell met with hospitals, nurses' associations, and senior citizens' groups to expl ain the thrust of the bill and how it would benefit the organizations' members, to ask that each group add its name to the list of those supporting the bill, and then to en- courage those members to testify be fore the legislature themselves. In the long run. of course, the target for your influential cam- paign is the legislators themselv es: the people who have the power to pass, defeat, or amend your law. When your organization is ready to embark on a grass roots lobbying campaign, take the fol- lowing steps. 1. Form a Lobbying Committee Organizations with larger budgets may be able to hire profes- sional lobbyists (either on-staff or as consultants) to represent them in their statehouse or before Congress. But volunteer-based groups probably will have to form a committee of people who either have some experience talking to legisl ators or who are willing to learn how to do so despite their lack of expertise. 2.

While it's important to know who your legislator is. it's proba- bly even more valuable to understand what he or she does. Legislators introduce or co-spons or legislation, hold hearings on legislation. lobby other legislators to get them to adopt their posi- tion, testify themselves, make stat ements on the floor of their leg- islative body, and help organize or lead coalitions of legislators to help pass a bill or raise the profile of an issue. Most legislators are elected from among the public at large; oc- casionally a candidate will be appoi nted to fill a vacant House or Senate seat, but these politicians, too, will have to seek reelection if they hope to maintain their position. Legislators are motivated by tw o frequently competing factors: votes and money. Ostensibly, legisl ators are elected to represent the voters who live in their distri cts, and their reelection depends to a great degree on their ability to meet the needs of those voters over time.

The 36 winners of 1992's U.S. Senate races spen t an average of $3, 647,218 to win election to their six-year terms. Many politic ians feel they must rely on po- litical action committees and campa ign contributions from special interests to enable them to pay for their elect ion or reelection cam- paigns. But don't be discouraged if you have to rely on your abil- ity to deliver votes, rath er than money, to help sway legislators in your direction. Said Vin Weber, a former Republican congressman who represented southwest Minnesot a for twelve years, \"The most powerful lobbyists are the ones th at can mobilize voters—it's re- ally the ability to move voters, more than the ability to give money, that influences the political process.\" T HE L EGISLATIVE S TAFF Though legislators are the ones w ho actually cast the votes, their staff arc often the ones who te l l th em how to vote. Most legislators rely on assistants to help draft le gislation, research issues, and de- fine positions. The numb er of staffers varies according to the size of the legislative body and the importance of the legislative office being occupied. For exam ple, in the U.S. Congress, a representa- tive will probably have a staff of around twenty, while committees are served by staffs of around fi fty to sixty. (The number of com- mittee staff members varies grea tly: The Senate Ethics Committee has thirteen while the Approp riations Committee has 206.) Regardless of how many p eople are on it, a legislator's staff is important. For one thing, the staf f help sway votes, not only those of their bosses, but of other legislat ors as well. In fact, staffers usu- ally know more about a particular piece of legislation than the leg- islator for whom they work; they are certainly more accessible to members of the public. In a large office, staff members perform a variety of functions: An administrative assistant, usuall y the legislator's closest political aide, runs the office and may exert the greatest infl uence over how the legislator votes. A legislative assistant reads and analyzes bills and often advises the legislator on what position to take on a spe- cific piece of legislation. In an o ffice with several legislative assis- tants, each one will specialize in on e or two issue areas.

Though you may not always be able to meet with a legislator, you can usually get in to see staff. Staff will help you refine your lobbying strategy by te lling you how a legislator is thinking of vot- ing and what problems the legislat or has with your bill, and by suggesting solutions. C OMMITTEES A committee is a group of legisl ators who consider specific is- sues, bills, and amendments before they are presented to the entire legislative body. Among the most common committees are those that work on the budget, health and human services, environmental protection, and education. A committee may be the most im portant forum in which you operate. Committees refine the co ntents of a proposed bill or amendment, convene hea rings to get input fr om the public, work out compromises among committee members who disagree on the legislation, and vote to determine whether to send the bill on to the entire legislature. If you lose in committee, it's harder to win on the floor; victory in committee creates a precedent and momentum that place a heavier bu rden on those seeking to halt the progress of a bill at the next stage of the proc ess. Understanding the member- ship and dynamics of the committees that have jurisdiction over your issues is as important as kn owing individual legislators. Con- sult with other lobbyists and revi ew any available news stories to better understand the chairperson of the committee that has juris- diction over your bill. Is he or sh e strong and authoritative, weak and passive, confrontational or a consensus builder? What about the subcommittee chairmen? Are they forceful and independent or dominated by the chairman? How st rong is the staff at all levels? To whom do they answer? Do me mbers of the committee get along well or split along party lines?"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":" About the U.S. Congress Legislators elected to the U.S. Congress may be either senators or representatives. The U.S. House of Representa tives has 435 members. The number of representatives from a state depends on that state's pop- ulation. Thus, California, with a population of about 30 million, sends fifty-four repr esentatives to Washington. Little Vermont, whose population totals only 560,000, has but one representative to look out for its interests. Representatives must run for reelection every two years. All representatives maintain offices in their home districts to deal with what is called \"case work\": handli ng requests from constituents to find lost Social Security checks, he lp get a new post office, secure funding for a new park or wastewat er treatment plant, or otherwise go to bat for citizens agai nst the federal bureaucracy. In addition to the representati ves it sends to Congress, each state elects two senators who are supposed to represent the entire state. Each of the one hundred members of the Senate maintains several offices scattered around th e state to help stay in contact with constituents. Since each senator is elected to a six-year term. one third of the entire U.S. Se nate seeks reelection every two years. Staff who work in the local office s of your senators and repre- sentatives can tell you how they voted on specific issues, provide details about a piece of legislatio n in which you're interested, and direct you to other agencies or offices whose help you may need.

Wilderness Winner John Randolph is a real estate attorney in Birmingham, Alabama, with what some mi ght view as an anomalous yet fervent appreciation for wide open spaces and unde- veloped land—especially for the wilderness sections of his own state. The activist had a particul ar fondness for the Sipsey Wilderness Area, located about one hundred miles northwest of Birmingham, a pristine world of rare plants, wildflowers, and trees, interlaced with streams, surrounded by high cliffs, a nd containing hundreds of waterfalls."},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"310 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS Randolph seized an opport unity to push for expan- sion of the 12,700-acre Sipsey Wilderness Area in 1977, when Jimmy Carter, newly elected president of the United States, ordered a revi ew of all potential wilder- ness areas in the country. Ra ndolph believed the exist- ing boundaries of the Sipsey area would not protect the watershed of the region's lovely West Fork of the Sipsey River. Initially, along with organi zing the Alabama Wilder- ness Coalition—the core memb ers of which were the Alabama Conservancy, the Birmingham Audubon Soci- ety, and the Alabama Chap ter of the Sierra Club— Randolph persuaded Repres entative Ronnie Flippo. a Democratic member of the House of Representatives from the region in which Sips ey is located, to sponsor federal legislation protecting the entire 30,000 acres of the upper watershed of th e Sipsey's West Fork. Representative Flippo's bill easily passed in the House but was killed in the S enate by Alabama's senior U.S. Senator. Howell Heflin , a Democrat who bitterly opposed the measure on the grounds that it threatened Alabama's timber business, th e state's largest industry. Though the 30,000 acres that Randolph wanted to en- compass in an expanded Sipsey Wilderness Area represented only .2 percent of all the forest lands in Al- abama, the issue was an em otional one for the state's loggers, particularly a group of small timber firms that dubbed themselves SWUFFL, the Society for the Wise Use of Federal Forest Land s. The veteran senator was their powerful advocate. Randolph and his coalition might have lacked Heflin's congressional muscle , but they marshaled what would prove to be a more potent force: a grass roots movement that persuaded ci ty councils. Alabama state legislators, every major news paper in the state, and two Alabama governors to endo rse the move to expand Sipsey.

George Wallace, both Democrats. Randolph organized press tours of the wilderness area and oversaw creation of films and slide presenta- tions about it to keep the contr oversy in the public eye. His list of formal endorsem ents for expanding the re- gion's protection grew to include the state's conserva- tion and tourism departments , as well as the five municipal water districts—Birmingham and Jasper among them—which drew wa ter from the West Fork. Senator Heflin nevertheless remained adamantly op- posed to the Sipsey legislation and killed two more pro- posals aimed at expanding the wilderness region. When it became clear that he woul d never support the Sipsey bill as it was written, Rando lph and the other coalition leaders sought a compromise by scaling back their ex- pansion request to 13,000 acres. Another 5,000 acres of the West Fork were added through the use of a Nation al Wild and Scenic River designation. The U.S. Forest Service redesignated the remaining acreage a \"semip rimitive\" region, putting limits on the logging that coul d be done there. The area thus received \"a mix of protection,\" as Randolph put it, and even the industry-backed Alabama Forestry Associ- ation agreed to this proposal , persuading Senator Heflin to drop his opposition to the Sipsey expansion. Finally passed in 1988, the Sipsey Wilderness Area law doubled the size of th e protected region and added fifty-two miles of the West Fo rk and its tributaries to its National Wild and Scen ic River designation.

Develop a Lobbying Strategy When he was lobbying Congress to defeat the MX Missile. Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Ca use, made some remarks that seem to apply to all lobbying ca mpaigns. He noted: \"You cannot win these fights without intensity, you cannot win these fights with- out focus. You cannot win without persistence, you can't win with- out a long-term willingness to lose . You can't win a fundamental battle easily or quickly.\" But ulti mately. Wertheimer concluded, you can win—with luck, fortitud e, and the right strategy. Whether you're writing a new law or amending an old one. you follow the same essential steps in developing your lobbying strat- egy. (These steps should look fa miliar by now: th ey're the same ones you followed to devise yo ur general organizing and commu- nications strategies!) • Identify your goal. Is it to pass or defeat a bill? Strengthen or weaken amendments to a bill? Oppose or favor a nomina- tion for a cabinet position or court nominee? Endorse a res- olution? Each lobbying campaign should revolve around a specific desirable result. • Take stock of your organizational resources. Is this cam- paign going to require a lot of travel, the printing and distri- bution of a variety of public ations, intense long-distance telephoning or faxing, and ot her capital expe nditures? Do you have enough staff or vol unteers to prepare materials, meet with legislators, and keep on top of the process? Who is going to educate the media, write letters to the editor, and meet with editorial writers? Do your staff and volunteers have the credibility to wage the campaign? Answer these questions honestly, then look to ways you can build coali- tions and stretch your own re sources to get the job done.

Identify legislators who can provide lead- ership on the bill and help gu ide it through the legislative process. Get one or more legislators to introduce the pro- posed measure, and recruit as many co-sponsors as possible. Focus on legislators who have not yet made up their minds about how they will vote. While you will also want to shore up your supporters, don't wast e precious time or resources on opponents whose minds you kn ow you can't sway. Target the swing voters for lobby vis its, letters, and telegrams, and aim your publicity about the b ill to press outlets in their home districts. Compile a list of elected offi cials with their telephone numbers and addresses. Keep track of those who support your position, those who oppose it, and those who have yet to make up their minds. Identify the most influential people in the legislative body; pinpoin t whether anyone in your or- ganization knows them personally. Rank elected officials ac- cording to your ability to in fluence them on the issue. • Choose your tactics. Hold media events like the one the seniors held in Indianapolis to give your issue credibility and generate public support. Offe r testimony at hearings about your proposed bill to help l egislators understand your posi- tion. Visit a legislator's office in person to convey the impor- tance of the issue. (You may h ave to do this several times: initially, to present your position and ask for support; later. to get a commitment if you have n't done so already; and fi- nally, right before a vote.) Gener ate letters, telegrams, faxes, and telephone calls to legislators to turn the heat up before a vote. Meet with legislator s in their home districts. • Know your time frame. How much time do you actually have before your bill faces cruc ial votes? If a vote is imminent, you'll have to be able to mobili ze volunteers quickly and gen- erate substantial visibility to help advocate your position."},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"314 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS More time will allow you to reassess your goals regularly while winning interim victories that keep activists and sup- porters motivated, sustain interest from the media, and create opportunities for your leaders an d activists to develop their skills through training wo rkshops or other activities.

Delays on other legi slation, a local or national crisis, or political maneuvering ca n throw the sched- ule off by weeks or even months. As the League of Women Voters advises its citizen lobby- ists: \"Anticipate the rhythms of the political calendar, then choose the moment when you r message can be heard with minimal distraction and maximum sympathy . .. timing is everything.\" Take cues from le gislators who support you and staff of those who s till haven't made up their minds.

Build a Coalition It is not unusual to have to con tact personally a hundred or more people during a legislative campai gn, considering how many law- makers and staff you need to reach. In fact, you'll probably want to communicate in some way with every member of the legislature before your lobby campaign is finally put to rest. In addition to the strictly legisl ative activities you undertake, you may also need to generate editorials that support your position (and send an unmistakable message to an elected official); organize me- dia events; produce materials for distribution to legislators, the me- dia, and the public; and raise mone y to keep the whole affair going. Few groups can mount such an e ffort alone. And even if they could, broad-based coalitions that re present a diverse array of constit- uents and interests are much harder to ignore than a single-issue in- terest group who can't convincingly claim to speak for \"the people.\" Many lips for building a successful coalition were outlined Chapter 3. But remember these key points: • Begin by working with your natural allies. These may in- clude religious, parent, social service, women's, labor, mi- nority, senior citizen , and peace groups. • Explore the possibility of working in coalition with groups or individuals with whom you may not have agreed in the past, but who may share your interests on this issue. Remember how powerful the Mothers of East L.A. became when they teamed up with local businesses to defeat the prison plans? • Even if other groups won't jo in your coalition, they may agree to help lobby a legislator on the issue. Ask them to write or sign postcards that you can collect and submit for them, circulate petitions for support among their members, offer the names of other people and organizations that can be contacted, write letters to the editor, or print an article about the situation in their newsletters. • Give all coalition members an important job to do. Some may meet with legislators while others write press releases, organize media events, prepare brochures and fact sheets, and mail or fax information."},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"316 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS Remember, you do not need to have a name, set up a steering committee, write bylaws, or staff an office for the coalition to be effective. It is not unusual for ad hoc committees to come together around a particular piece of legi slation—as did the Indiana Home Care Task Force—and then to di sband until another important is- sue calls. 5. Formulate Your Legislative Arguments Organizations take various approac hes in presenting their posi- tion to legislators. Some groups favor a \"go for broke\" approach, crafting firm positions that repres ent their entire le gislative wish list. Others work incrementally; Though they keep their sights fixed on their long-term goals, they focus on short-term objectives to move their agenda along bit by bit. Whatever the strategy, it is usually determined by the poli tical realities of the moment: whether a majority of legislators supports your opinion, whether a group has the resources to sustain a campaign over time, or whether the issue is so immediate that regardless of available re- sources or legislative support it must be brought to a vote. To determine what your positio n should be, consult with other members of your coalition as well as with legislators and their aides who are friendly to your cau se. Brainstorm several legislative options you may have, and explore the positive and negative ram- ifications of each one. Once you have opted for a particul ar position, develop a series of arguments that clearly and conc isely support your point of view. It is critical that these argument s be as persuasive and compelling as possible: They will become th e backbone of a ny testimony you give on the legislation, will be presented in meetings you have with individual legislators, and will probably become the topics of news releases to promote your wo rk on the legislation as well as fund-raising appeals to ra ise money to support it. Don't assume that a l l legislators will be interested in your leg- islation for the same reasons. Some lawmakers support legislation to protect the environment because they value the intrinsic nature of the ecosystem; others believe new investments in environmental protection will create jobs. Develop a backgrounder or fact sheet that clearly lays out your legislative rationale. In simple, no ntechnical language, offer five to ten reasons why legisl ators should support your approach.

P LAN THE L OBBYING V ISIT Develop a strategy in advance. What's the purpose of the meet- ing? What do you want to accomp lish? Do you need to give infor- mation or get information? Do you want to elicit support for a particular position or generate oppo sition to a developing situa- tion? Review the facts supporting your position so that everyone understands the issues and you ca n discuss your presentation and develop your ideas together. Cons ider arguments for and against your position. Research past elect ion data, as well as personal background and voting behavior of the official so you know some- thing about him or her personally. Pay particular attention to the legislator's voting record on iss ues similar to the one you will be discussing.

Take the con- gressman's advice. Visit your legislators in person, either in the district they represent or in t heir offices (this could mean in the mayor's chambers, in a senator' s or congressman's Washington, DC, office, or at a state capitol). It may be difficult to secure an appointment, especially with a member of Co ngress, but persevere.

Understand that there's a world of dif- ference between a legislator's remarking \"I understand what you're saying,\" and \"I support your legislation.\" Only the latter is a commitment. If a legislator is considered a \"swing\" vote and hasn't made up his mind, ask others to help lobby through phone calls, letters, telegrams, and personal visits. Send a thank-you note to the official raising your position again and requesting that you be kept informed. 7. Monitor the Entire Process: How a Bill Becomes a Law Meeting with your legislator is only one of many actions re- quired to convert an idea into leg islation. The process is a compli- cated one that you may have to monitor every inch of the way. The following chart shows, in general, the steps involved in creating legislation. How a Bill Is Passed Your Role • A bill is prepared. • Suggest provisions to be contained in the bill. • The bill is introduced in one house of the legislature by one or two sponsors and many co-sponsors. • Help line up legislative co- sponsors for the bill. • The bill is examined by a committee according to its subject area (e.g., a bill to control drug traffic would be assigned to the judiciary committee). • Work with the committee to help its members under- stand the bill and prevent any tinkering that could weaken it. • Hearings are held to dis- cuss the bill. • Testify at the hearings. • The committee votes on the bill. • Lobby committee members to support the bill."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"320 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS How a Bill Is Passed Your Role • If the bill passes through the committee, it is sent along to the entire legisla- tive body to be debated further and voted upon. • Lobby swing voters in the full house to support the bill, and generate letters, phone calls, lobby visits, and media from your sup- porters to do the same. • If it passes, it is sent to the other house in the legisla- ture (unless the other house is working on similar legis- lation already.) • Line up co-sponsors for the bill in the other house. • The bill is examined by the relevant committee in that branch of the legislature. • Work with members of that committee to strengthen support for the bill. • Hearings are held again. • Testify. • The bill is debated on the house floor. • Lobby swing voters. * • If the bill passes, it proba- bly does so with amend- ments that now need to be negotiated in a \"conference committee\" made up of representatives of both houses before it is finally voted on. • Lobby members of the conference committee to protect the bill from weak- ening amendments. • If it passes, it is sent to the executive (the governor or president) for signature. • Publicize the bill's passage and generate support for signing it. • If the executive signs the bill, it becomes law. • Celebrate! LOBBYING TOOLS Meetings with legislators and staf f offer one way to influence leg- islation.

The packet should include: • A cover letter urging the legislat or to adopt your position on the bill, appointment, or amendment in question. • Fact sheets arguing your position. • Endorsements from prominent c onstituents and experts in the field. • Copies of news stories or edito rials that favor your position. • A list of supporting organizatio ns, interest groups, national figures, and local leaders who support your position. Some groups also prepare a deta iled description of the objec- tions to their argument that are lik ely to be raised by their oppo- nents. Take the offensive. Iden tify your adversaries, by group and by name if possible. Describe th eir arguments and counter with your own. Such a tactic will also help prepare legislators for argu- ments they'll have to make on behalf of your position. Video More and more organizations are turning to video as an effec- tive way to convince their legislators to take appropriate action. Many legislators are frequently too busy to get out of their offices and observe problems firsthand ; others simply do not have the budget to travel to a distant destin ation. Offering legislators a short videotape that captures the ess ence of your position can help focus attention on your issue and persu ade legislators of the importance of your campaign, as long as the tape provides crisp images that clearly convey exactly what you say they do.

Terri Moore used he rs to lobby the Indiana state legislature. When an existing landfill expanded to engulf 90 acres just 1.700 feet from her home, it didn't take long for Terri and other Center Point, Indiana, residents to notice the lines of idling semi s waiting to drop their foul cargos basically in their backyards. Apart from the sheer volume of garbage that was being dumped, Terri was bothered by the fact that most of the trucks sported li- cense plates from the East Coast. Why were places like Pennsylvania, New York, and New Jersey trashing Cen- ter Point? Terri, a mother and former lab technician who works for her family's petroleum marketing business, began to investigate, purchasing a Sears camcorder to help her out. \"I'm just a local citizen exercising my right to docu- ment what's going on in my landfill!\" she said as she narrated one of the videos. A few preliminary inquiries revealed that neither the state of Indiana nor the federal government required any documentation or certification for out-of-state garbage dumpers. Terri's backyard could be used to store trash from anywhere in the United States. With landfills on the East Coast and elsewhere rapidly filling up. Center Point's facility was turning out to be everyone's dump. Terri was already a member of HOPE (Hoosiers Op- posed to Pollution of the Environment) of Clay County, which worked to promote recy cling in the area. To doc- ument the dumpings, she organized fellow HOPE mem- bers and other townspeople into a Dump Patrol. Six days a week, seventy-five people—a significant percent- age of the town's populatio n of 250—split up into four- hour shifts and, ten hours a day, manned patrol posts just outside the landfill gates."},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"324 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS The activists recorded every truck that entered the dump. They wrote down license plate numbers and fo- cused their lenses on truck accidents, which were fre- quent. Ten percent of the trucks, they found, were lost or off route, and it was commonplace to see trucks run over signs and front yards. The videocamera captured the disgustingly dirty conditi on of the trucks and their vile contents, and filmed any suspected violations of waste rules, creating a powerful body of evidence. In addition to the videotape, the Dump Patrol took still photographs of the violations, which proved a handy tool to combat indus try arguments. The patrol mailed the photos to the companies whose advertise- ments appeared on the sides of the trucks. When they saw the abhorrent trucking pr ocedures, the advertisers were quick to pull their ads. The threat of losing ad dol- lars sent some companies spinning into action to im- prove their policies. These photos would become part of the activists' testimony before Congress—both state and federal! The Dump Patrol soon learned of a practice that was not only disgusting, but endangering the health of many people beyond Center Point: To the activists' horror, truck drivers reported that they usually hauled meat, seafood, and produce back to their home states in the same maggot-infested trucks in which they had trans- ported the garbage. Vowing to stop the revolting prac- tice, Terri and the Dump Patrol turned to their state legislature. In the summer of 1989, the group brought its most graphic photographs to a meeti ng of the legislature's In- terim Study Committee on the Environment. Many committee members had heard about the landfill and the Dump Patrol via the local and state media, which had begun to cover the growing piles of garbage and the ac- tivists' mission. Still, the legislators were shocked by what they saw and heard. For five minutes. Terri re- counted what the group had discovered, displaying her photographs for all to see.

The activ- ists attended every \"crackerba rrel,\" or county meeting, with kids in tow to impr ess upon lawmakers why the stakes were so high. Now ve ry aware of the power of their video evidence, they created a ''newscast\" in which Terri as reporter showcased the dumping and the condition of the trucks and described the sheer number of out-of-state vehicles they had documented: over 2,500 filthy semis in twenty-three weeks. Terri was asked to testify before the House Subcom- mittee on Transportation and Hazardous Materials on behalf of another federal bi ll, and again brought pic- tures, this time enlarged to allow the entire room to see. The national lawmakers were engrossed in her \"home- made\" visual proof of exploitative dumping on a \"de- fenseless\" community! ABC- TV not only covered the hearing but aired her video on \"Nightline,\" showing the country the inside of a refri gerator truck—before it was loaded with food—cra wling with maggots from its pre- vious load of garbage.

Planned Parenthood used to tell its members \"letters are the barometers that measure political pres- sure back home/' and that's truly the case.

And when an issue is controversial, tens of thousands or even hun- dreds of thousands of letters may pour into Washington on behalf of or in opposition to a bill or an appointment. Letters are equally effective on the state level—Nancy Ricci sustained her organizing efforts for years through the momentum generated by letters from her and many other RID supporters.

Distribute blank postcards, sheets of paper, envelope s, and pens, but also ask partic- ipants to bring their own personal st ationery and/or a typewriter if they have one.

But people may need assistance in remembering the bill name and num ber and the most important is- sues to raise. Distribute a one-p age sheet containing essential infor- mation, such as the proper title and number of the bill involved, and a summary of your reasons for supporting or opposing it. Make sure your letters tell legislators how they should vote on the issue. When the letters are written, provi de stamps and take them to the post office or mailbox.

The Metropolitan Opera in New York City, the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, and the Hubbard Street Dance Company in Chicago all be- long to the alliance, as do many smaller local arts organizations. AAA is dedicated to charting a comprehensive fed- eral arts policy; it serves as a resource on arts matters for federal agencies, Congre ss, and the White House, and lobbies frequently on issues that affect nonprofits in general, such as taxes and po licy, as well as to increase funding for the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). The NEA, which provides public money to support artists and exhibitions, is constantly being battered by conservative lobbyists who tout family values and effec- tively discourage the federal funding of \"controversial\" art projects. When, in respon se to a barrage of negative lobbying, the House and Sena te Appropriations Com- mittees threatened to cut off NEA's funding altogether, Anne G. Murphy, former execu tive director of the alli- ance, had a brainstorm. First, remind legislators that only a small minority of the works NEA has ever funded have been controver sial. Second, show legisla- tors how NEA's relatively mi nor budget compared to the huge amounts of money Amer icans spend on other pas- times. Discarding the \"mundane \" practice of writing let- ters.

The Alliance came up with sixteen catchy \"Artfacts\" that demonstrated the worth of the arts and how little funding they receive.

In the spring of 1992, the American Arts Alliance used clever sticky notes to lobby members of Congress to increase funding for the arts. Four pads—each sporting a di fferent set of Artfacts— were shrink-wrapped together, so that every legislator re- ceived each of the sixteen facts.

In conjunction with the Post -It effort, the Alliance set up a series of meetings with \"swing\" members of Congress—those who had not yet firmly supported or opposed the endowment—to persuade them to join the ranks of NEA advocates. When all was said and done, AAA had secured funding for the NEA for another year. The Post-Its offered a refreshingly different approach from conventional lobbying tactics. Beyond being use- ful, they repeated the Alliance's message over and over again. 3-M, Post-It's manufacturer, claims that each sticky note is read three times before it is thrown out. Isn't repetition the key to understanding? Faxes Most, but not all, members of C ongress make their fax numbers available to the public, and letters can certainly be faxed to those who do.

(Sometimes, volunteer s are asked to participate for two days: the first day, for a tr aining session in lobby techniques; the second, to do the actual lobbying.) To maximize publicity, you can hol d a news conference before the lobbying begins and inform reporters who cover legislation for a newspaper, radio station, or te levision station not based in Wash- ington or your state capital that someone from their community is in town lobbying. Give citizen lobbyists persuasive materials to deliver to each legislator they visit. In addition to written materials such as those described above, they may want to distribute some item that would provide a good \"photo opportunity\" for the media (like the seat cushions Jan Garton and the Cheyen ne Bottoms task force distrib- uted to their Kansas legislators). Oral Testimony At some point in the legislative process, hearings will be con- vened to discuss a bill on which you are lobbying. (The only way to know precisely when this will occur is to keep in constant con- tact with the committee convenin g the hearings.) Someone from your organization may be invited to testify; you can also request the opportunity to testify.

But you should also submit written testimony for the record that can be much more detailed. In addition, you can offer eye-catching charts or exhibits that might result in newspaper photos or television cov- erage of your testimony. Expect tough questions during your testimony. Rehearse your statement beforehand, with other members of your group acting as \"hostile\" questioners to prepare yourself for the experience. Publicity Lobbyist Michael Pertschuk wrote in The Giant Killers: \"Ink is the public interest lobbyist's hol y grail. Almost any media cover- age of a campaign is panted afte r. All public interest advocates are confident that right would prevail if the people only knew.\" There are several steps you can take to ensure that the people do know. The following actions are appropriate to take whether you're lobbying Congress, the state legislator, or your city council: • Develop a comprehensive media strategy to complement your lobbying strategy. Organize committees that can be mobilized to write letters to the editor. Begin planning me- dia activities that will bolster th e efforts of your lobbyists. Time the staging of press conferences and media events and the release of reports to have maximum impact on the leg- islative process (remember to \"leave room for escalation\"; build up your press coverage over time and save events and activities that pack the bigg est punch for the time in the campaign when you really need them). Target individual legislators for media events, ad campaigns, and letters in their districts when you need to affect the votes of specific lawmakers. • Prepare a list of reporters an d editors whom you can ed- ucate about the issue and rely upon over time to write stories. The list should contain fax and phone numbers as well as addresses of reporters who cover your issue at radio and television stations, daily and weekly newspapers, news- letters and magazines, and other media outlets. The list should also contain the contact information for the capi- tol press corps, those reporters who are based in the capitol building (this is true whether you're focused on your state"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"L OBBYING 337 capital or on Washington, DC ) and who specifically cover the activities of the legislature. • Build relationships with reporters. The capitol press corps cover what the legislator fro m their district does, when the legislature is scheduled to consider a measure or vote, and other legislative issues. The ca pitol press corps is probably the easiest group of reporters to track down, because they al- most always work out of a pre ss room that's located in the capitol building. Drop by their desks, introduce yourself, and leave behind some bac kground information about the legisla- tion you're working on. Try to set up a on e-on-one lunch or meeting with individual reporter s to talk to them about your agenda for the current legisl ative session. Keep in touch through mail or faxes regularly. Invite them to attend press events, urge them to cover any testimony you present, and alert them to pending votes. Wh en your measure is being de- bated in a committee or by the fu ll legislature, seek reporters out so you can put your spin on the story and give them a quotable quote. • Meet with the editorial boar d of your local newspaper to explain your position and ask for support. Follow up with a thank-you note, and continue to send news releases and other press materials. • Mount a letters-to-the-editor campaign prior to an im- portant vote. Also send out letters to editorial writers ap- prising them of the situation and asking for a supportive editorial. • Draft an opinion editorial that concisely explains your point of view, and try to get it placed a couple of days be- fore the vote to help convin ce legislators to support you. Send legislators a copy as soon as it's printed. • Stage a media event either in the capitol or in the legis- lator's home district. Make sure the event is well covered by television, radio, and newspapers. • Organize a petition drive. Deliver the petitions en masse to the legislator's office, acco mpanied by reporters who will give the story good play in the local news. • Hold a press conference on the steps of the capitol to de- mand action. Distribute press releases and other materials to"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"338 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS reporters in attendance, and f ax copies to those who don't show. • Take out newspaper ads (weekl y papers are cheaper) or advertise on the radio (in tw enty- or thirty-second sound bites) to let your legislat or know you mean business. Send copies of the ads to reporters who might do st ories about the ad campaign. • Release a report that substa ntiates your concerns about the issue, and hold a news con ference to distribute copies and answer questions. Excerpt a portion of the report into an op-ed piece that you ask your newspaper to print. As with other media efforts you make, your chances of generat- ing publicity for your lobbying campaign will increase exponen- tially if the story you're pitching is \"newsworthy\": if it's new, timely, controversial and colorful: if it revolves around crisis or conflict; and if it will affect large numbers of people in a signifi- cant way (see Chapter 6 for a leng thier discussion on what the me- dia consider to be newsworthy). Here are some specific exampl es of when you have lobbying news: • When you petition the le gislature (or city or county council) for a change in the law. • When supportive legislators introduce a proposal. • When opponents lobby against your proposals. • When public debate and controve rsy over the issue develops (through talk shows, in terviews, debates, etc.). • When a group of your advocates congregates for a day of lobbying. • When editorial writers and colu mnists endorse your position. • When hearings on the bill are held. • When the legislature debates the measure. • When the legislature votes on the measure. • When the bill is enacted by the legislative body and signed by the executive. • When plans for its implementation are developed. • When activities commemorate th e date of implementation."},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"L OBBYING 339 When you generate news that endorses or substantiates your po- sition, reproduce the news clips an d send them to legislators.

ACTION AT THE POLLS E VERY VOTER EXERCISES a public trust, remarked Grover Cleveland in his inaugural address on March 4, 1885, and that is as true today as it was a hundred years ago. How voters exercise that trust is another matter. What do they vote for? Who do they vote for? These are the essential questions activists grapple with when they d ecide to try to motivate voters to cast their ballots for or against specific candidates or issues. Mounting a political campaign to a ffect the actions voters take at the polls is complicated, expens ive and intense.

Today, getting shot does the same thing. Victims who haven't given much previous thought to handgun control suddenly rea lize how important an is- sue it is—and they become determined activists on its behalf. In March 1981. Olen J. Kelley, an assistant man- ager of a suburban supermarke t, was shot in the chest by a robber wielding a short-barreled .38-caliber re- volver, the kind of cheap handgun known as a \"Satur- day Night Special.\" That same month. John W. Hinkley had used a Saturday Night Special manufactured by the same company to shoot President Ronald Reagan. Olen Kelley decided to do what no one had ever done before: sue Florida-based R. G. Industries, the manufacturer of that pistol, for damages. Doing the Unprecedented After three years of litiga tion, Kelley wound up with a landmark decision by the Maryland Court of Appeals. which ruled in October 1985 that the makers and sellers of low-quality Saturday Night Specials indeed could be held liable for the damages suffered when shooting vic- tims were wounded by one of their weapons. The Maryland court's preceden t-setting decision cre- ated the first legal definition of what a Saturday Night Special handgun is. But it also set in motion a chain of events involving legislators, high-paid political consul- tants, grass roots organizers and hundreds of volunteers in a multimillion-dollar battle between people like Mr. Kelley, who were seeking curbs on handgun sales, and the powerful National Rifle Association (NRA) and its allies in the retailing and insurance business."},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"A CTION AT THE P OLLS The Battle Lines Are Drawn The face-off began as soon as Maryland's Court of Ap- peals issued its Kelley ruling.

A member of the Maryland At- torney General's Office, Vi ncent DeMarco, and one of his former college roommates at Baltimore's Johns Hopkins University, Bernard Horn, correctly suspected that the NRA would try to ambush the Kelley ruling in the halls of the state legisl ature during its 1986 session by seeking passage of a law to invalidate the court's handgun decision. DeMarco and Horn, who was a private citizen and at- torney, formed a citizens gr oup, Mary landers for Vic- tims' Rights, to lobby agains t any NRA effort to void Kelley and began working in co alition with another one of their former college roommates, Len Lucchi, a pri- vate attorney representing the Maryland Fraternal Order of Police, to lobby hard against the NRA-backed bill. Intense lobbying against har dball progun lobbyists dur- ing both the 1986 and 1987 le gislative sessions helped the ailing survive those se ssions intact, though only by a thread. \"The full force of the House leadership was on the NRAs side, but you need seventy-one voles to enact a bill,\" DeMarco recalls abou t the bill proposed in 1987 to overturn Kelley. \"The progun side only got sixty- seven.\" More Legislative Wrangling Despite their victories, DeMarco and the other gun con- trol advocates realized that they could not defend the court's ruling in Kelley forever. During the summer of 1987, DeMarco began draftin g legislation that would \"codify\" the court decision —and create a handgun re- view process that would lis t handguns that could be banned in Maryland, using the criteria the appellate court cited in the Kelley ruling when it defined a Satur- day Night Special: concealability , barrel length, quality of materials, accuracy, re liability, and other factors."},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"344 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS A New Law Is Born In 1988, weary gun control advocates found themselves mobilizing for yet a third ro und of lobbying to defend the Kelley ruling.

With the stakes thus boosted to a new level, at least in the state of Maryland, the fight between the progun and antigun for- ces came to overshadow even the 1988 presidential con- test in Maryland. The Battle for Ballots Calling on its 49,000 Maryland members, the NRA helped create its own local citizens action group, the Maryland Committee Against the Gun Ban. Although the progun forces received some 3,400 small contribu- tions and sold thousands of $1 raffle tickets, they only raised $100,000 this way. The bulk of their money came from the NRA. The largest single contributor of the gun control forces was Handgun Control, Inc., which donated $95,000. The gun control advocates raised the rest of their money locally, obtaining much of it from the deep- pocketed supporters of Maryland governor William Donald Schaefer. Angered by the NRA's heavy-handed entry into Maryland politic s, the governor strongly backed the gun control law. Vincent DeMarco, the intense, energetic native of It- aly who was brought by his parents to the United States as a child, took an unpaid leave of absence from the Maryland Attorney General's Office to .serve as director of a new group, Citizens for Eliminating Saturday Night Specials (CESNS).

He knew the turf and had well-honed tactics ready to deploy—among them, mas- sive radio, television, an d print advertising campaigns aimed at convincing Maryland's voters that the gun con- trol measure was \"a bad law\" that ultimately would lead to banning the sa le of all guns. Taking Shots The NRA's ads hit upon them es that were cagey and almost—but not entirely— deceptive.

This further enraged the governor, whose well-connecte d former campaign asso- ciates began raising more money to counter the NRA's efforts. Some of the NRA TV adver tisements ran into trou- ble. In mid-September, seve ral stations declined to air the ads, deeming them distor ted.

REFERENDA, INITIATIVES, AND OTHER \"DO-IT-YOURSELF\" STRATEGIES Three election devices enable organizers to become \"citizen leg- islators\" by taking their issues directly to the public for ap- proval. As is evident from the Ma ryland handgun battle, a referendum is a process by which vo ters approve or reject a law the state leg- islature already has passed. Referend a can either be put on the bal- lot via a citizens' petition drive or by the state legi slature itself. Twenty-four stales out of fifty allow citizens to petition a law to referendum; twenty-five of the fifty states also give the legislature the power to put a law be fore the public for a vote. An initiative is a proposed new law that is put directly before voters for approval or rejection after organizers have collected a required number of signatures in order to place the issue on the ballot. Only twenty-three of fifty st ates allow the initiative process: Arizona, Arkansas, Alaska. Califor nia. Colorado, Florida, Idaho. Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan. Missouri, Montana, Ne- braska, Nevada, North Dakota. Ohio, Oklahoma. Oregon. South Dakota, Utah, Washington, and Wyom ing. (Though it is technically inaccurate to say so, once an initiative effort makes it to the ballot, it is generally referred to as a referendum.) Most frequent in plac- ing initiative questions on the ballot are California. Oregon, Colo- rado, Arizona, and North Dakota. Most organizations mount initiati ve and referendum campaigns to demonstrate popular support for an issue in order to persuade the legislature to act upon it, to curtail the efforts of their oppo- nents (which is what both the pro gun and the gun control forces in Maryland were doing), to ratify legislation that has already been passed, or to create laws when th e legislature is unwilling or un- able to do so."},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"354    T HE B UILDING B LOCKS A recall allows voters to petition for a special election to re- move an elected official from office.

Whether you're mounti ng a referendum, an in itiative, or a recall campaign, all three acti ons involve essentially the same steps. You must describe the action you are pr oposing in writing that is le- gally accurate, collect signatures (unless the issue has been put on the ballot by legislators) on petiti ons that describe your proposed action, and mount an intense pub licity and grass roots organizing campaign. What are the pros an d cons of engaging in this process? Taking an issue directly to voters via the polls is a very difficult, expensive, and time-consuming w ay to advance your political agenda. Before going ahead with such a camp aign, groups should make sure that neither an effec tive lobbying campaign nor pressure on the executive branch of government to pa ss an executive or ad- ministrative order would work to instate their law. The effort to collect signatures and mount a camp aign can take a year or more, detracting from your other organ izational business, exhausting your staff, and. should you fail, undermining the credibility of your group. On the other hand, a successful campaign can wo rk wonders for your organization and its goals by allowing you to take charge of the political process and achieve results that might otherwise be impossible.

However, half of those issues that do make it onto the ballot win voter approval. Given those odds, how can you insu re that your effort will be a success? First, before going ahead, determ ine whether a po pular vote is the best way to achieve the policy change you desire. Ask yourself the following questions: • Can you win approval for your proposals by waging an effective lobbying campaign instead? Don't launch an ini- tiative crusade if the issue is so narrow that the general pub- lic will have no intere st in it. Fight those campaigns in the state legislature, where you'll have greater opportunity to present the minute deta ils involving your i ssue in detail to an audience of lawmakers who will have more time to listen to your arguments. • Can the change you're seeking be achieved through an executive or administrative or der instead of by legislation or at the polls? Working through exis ting channels may be quicker—and much cheaper—t han going to the polls. • How strong is public support fo r your initiative or refer- endum? Your base of support shou ld be solid enough to sus- tain the withering attack you' ll probably receive from your opponents. If at least 50 percent of the public does not en- dorse the ideas behind your in itiative when you launch it. you may want to postpone t he campaign and spend a year cultivating more favorable public opinion. • Do you have the financial and organizational resources needed to mount a successf ul initiative or referendum"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"356 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS campaign? While, as the Mary land handgun campaign showed, you don't have to ma tch your opponent's war chest dollar for dollar, you do need enough capital to pay for es- sential salaries, office expe nses, printing, and advertising costs. • What allies do you have? You can't win an initiative cam- paign working all by yourself. The broader your coalition is based, the more likely it is you'll succeed. • How powerful is your opposition? Answer this question not only in terms of money, but in terms of clout. The Mary- land chapter of Gun Owners of America wa s intimidating because it was backed by the National Rifle Association, one of the country's most powerfu l political lobbying groups. • What will be the repe rcussions if you lose? Will defeat devastate your organization and render your issue irrelevant? Or will it raise needed visibility for your fight that will help you win next time around? Sometimes, as in the case of Maryland's handgun campaign, you have no choice but to engage in the process to protect gains you have made in the courts or in the legislature. In other cases, you may feel lik e you have to do what the legislature either can't or won't do. Regardless of wh at motivates you to go directly to the voters, you 've got to do your best to win.

Draft the Measure Assemble a small committee to wr ite an initial version or draft of your law. Use language that is not so radical it will offend a ma- jority of voters or so balanced th at it fails to inspire activists to participate in the campaign. In Be It Enacted By the People; A Cit- izen's Guide to Initiatives, published in 1981 by the Northern Rockies Action Group, author and grass roots organizer Mike A. Males urges activists to keep in mind the charges your opponents will inevitably throw against you: that your proposed law— whatever it is—is \"vague, unconstitu tional, will raise your taxes, will create more govern ment bureaucracy, will fuel inflation, will increase unemployment, is backed by special interests, and may even kill you. Vote no.\" Make a radical plan more app ealing by having it enacted in stages and allowing a period of vol untary compliance with the law before it becomes mandatory. Make the law \"readable\" by us ing short words and sentences and clumping information into subheadings, almost in outline form. Ask many people to review what you've written: Lawyers, who can check it for constitutiona lity; other constituency groups that will be affected by the b ill if it becomes law; even your op- ponents, who may identify nuances in the language that could be- come troublesome during the initia tive campaign later on. Perhaps most important, meet with professional bill drafters at the legisla- ture (you may need a legislator to formally request their help), who can tell you whether your law is t oo broad or too narrow to accom- plish what it intends. When filing a referendum measure, before signatures are gath- ered, you generally must include the text of th e law to be referred. The petition form then includes an official summary of the mea- sure and a ballot title written by the government—a short descrip- tion of the referendum that will appear on the ballot.

Be absolutely certain that the law says exactly what you want it to say. for once you file your draft with the secretary of stat e, you cannot change a word. 4. Design Your Petition Form The petition is the piece of paper that you will use to collect the signatures you need to put your proposed law on the ballot. It should contain the law as you have written it. plus signature lines allowing people to write and print their names and addresses. Check with the secretary of state to make certain that your petition form uses the exact headings, warn ings, and signature format pre- scribed in the laws governing your state's initiative and referendum procedure. 5. File Your Petition File the final draft of the law and the petition form with your secretary of state. Propose at least two titles for the petition that explain the issue the way you want it described. Then contact your state's attorney general, who wr ites the title, and closely monitor that titling process. A measure to regulate construction of nuclear power plants could be opposed on th e grounds that it constituted a \"ban\" on nuclear power as an energy source or supported be- cause it gives voters \"control\" over energy growth, depending on how the title is worded, 6. Organize Your Signature-Gathering Campaign While you are awaiting approval of your petition, identify coor- dinators for each area of the state who will be responsible for lin- ing up volunteers, distributing pe titions, getting petitions notarized. and returning them to the proper location. Hold an organizing meeting to motivate volunteers, build \"team spirit,\" and answer questions. Put together an organizing kit for each coordinator. It should in- clude: • The campaign timetable. • A \"fill-in-the-blanks\" news release to help kick off the cam- paign in each city."},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"A CTION AT THE P OLLS 359 • Instructions (gleaned from stat e regulations) on how to col- lect signatures properly. • A fact sheet on the petition and the reasons for circulating it. • Quotas for the number of signat ures you want each coordina- tor to collect. • Tips on how to recruit and manage volunteers. Once your petition is approved and titled, pr oofread it again for typographical errors. Depending on how many signatures you need, you'll probably have to print a few thousand petitions. Dis- tribute them to volunteers and hold a news conference (or at least issue a news release) announcing that your signature drive has be- gun. Your group may need to register as a political action committee when you file your petitions. Check with your state's campaign practice office so you operate within the law. Also, make sure you designate or elect officers of the group, especially a treasurer, who can establish a bank account and keep track of all financial trans- actions in which the group engages. 7. Gather the Signatures Collecting thousands of signatur es is a grueling task. Some states impose limits on the ma ximum amount of time you may have to amass the names you need . All states have rules governing the \"correct\" way a sign ature must be written, which usually ends up disqualifying a significant percen tage of those a group collects. To be safe, a group often must co llect a larger number of signa- tures than the law requires. Recognize that you'll be able to collect more signatures in large urban areas than in less populate d rural ones, and set up quotas for signatures accordingly. Focus on collecting signatures at shopping malls, on university campuses, outside transportation hubs, at county fairs, at sporting events —anywhere it will be easy to ap- proach a lot of people in a shor t period of time and in a concen- trated space. (In the recall example that follows, activists amassed their signatures from voters on election day.) You can also try can- vassing door to door for signatures, but this time-consuming tactic is not really effective if you're facing a tight deadline. Some states will ask that you su bmit your petitions to the sec- retary of state; in other states, you may have to turn the petitions over to the clerk and recorder in the county where the signatures"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"360 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS were collected. Determine the correct procedure for your state, and submit the documents accordingly. Eventually, your petitions will be tallied. If you have collected enough good signatures to qualify for the ballot, trumpel the news in a press release—and keep going! Even if you fall short of your goal, you can draw some positive conclusions from the experience and regroup for a future effort. Use Computers Because of the help they prov ide in managing large lists of names and addresses, word proc essing, streamlining accounting, interfacing with other computers , and data processing, computers can be an invaluable campaign as set. On the other hand, computers can cost campaigns a lot of money , especially when the purchase of an expensive computer leads to much greater expense in soft- ware, gadgets, and maintenance. The Republican National Com- mittee's State and Local Campaign Manual advises workers to clearly define their campaign goal s and then determine if a com- puter can help you reach those go als more cheaply, quickly, and ef- ficiently. If you do buy a computer , look for specialized software packages that generate ready-to-submit campai gn finance reports, create lists for mailing and phonin g, list donors, and perform other useful functions (see Chapter 6). 8. Develop a Persuasive Press Kit That Can Be Sent to the Press As Well As to \"Opinion Leaders\" The kit should contain: • News releases, updated as needed. • A backgrounder or fact sheet about the bill. • Lists of endorsements from other community groups and \"celebrities\" (the mayor, loca l sports heroes, business lead- ers, etc.). • Polling data supporting your initi ative, if it's available. • Background information about yo ur organization or coalition and why it is mounting the campaign."},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"A CTION AT THE P OLLS 361 9. Raise Money Once you collect your signatures and qualify for the ballot, your fund-raising efforts will probably pick up considerably. Neverthe- less, you're always going to have to raise more money than you have, and you'll almost never be able to matc h your opponents' war chest. Read the tips provided in the fund-raisi ng chapter of this book, Chapter 5, for more su ggestions on how to generate the resources you need to keep your campaign going. An d by the way, don't forget to comply with your state's cam paign finance report- ing requirements; you'll have to begin reporting as soon as you start collecting any money. 10. Conduct a Media Campaign to Convince People to Vote Your Way To a large degree, initiative ca mpaigns are media campaigns. A well-conceived publicity strategy w ill heighten the profile of your organization across the state, re cruit new members and contribu- tors, build media relations, and fo rm new coalitions. These benefits will accrue to your group even if you lose the campaign. As with any media campaign, the mo st successful strategy in an initiative effort is one that takes full advantage of the many public- ity tools available, targets the ri ght message at the right audience, and builds momentum throughout the campaign. You also need to expect to engage in a substantial advertising effort, so that you can counter attacks from your oppone nts and present your own mes- sage to voters in an undiluted way. You can review your publicity options from Chapter 6. As for targeting your audience, you'll probably want to focus on what is known as the \"swing vote,\" that block of citizens who haven't made up their mind about the issue and could either vote for you or against you. Try to identify the reasons voters may swing the other way, then present argument s that shore up your position. Generate momentum throughout the campaign by lining up a string of endorsements, schedu ling debates, and organizing media events every few weeks to keep your side of the story in the pa- pers. As the Maryland organizers of Citizens for Eliminating Sat- urday Night Specials showed, yo u can time your endorsements from prominent supporters at regular intervals—say, one a week—to build momentum; also sc hedule your press conferences before noon to get on midday TV news, \"drive-time\" radio later that day, and on the early even ing TV news.

Don't be shy about using gi mmicks and eye-catching tactics that will grab the attention of newspaper photographers and TV cameras. Remember the surprise \"handguns for breakfast\" stunt that got the antigun forc es in Maryland a lot of publicity, as well as contributions. As for the advertising side of it—well, resign yourself now to the inevitable truth: Chances are, you could be outspent by five or ten to one—and a lot of that money will be spent on a radio, tele- vision, and newspaper \"blitz\" inten ded to bury your issue once and for all. You can counterattack by being pr epared. Line up endorsers to come to your defense about the misleading content of the opposi- tion's materials, and paint your gr oup as the underdog. (If you be- lieve the opposition's ads are out-and-out distortions, file a formal complaint with the atto rney general and the TV or radio stations airing the ads, a move that will at least get you some media atten- tion.) Always try to keep your issue before the voters. Conduct one or more public op inion polls to determine what voters think of your measure and to track the impact of the oppo- sition's campaign on your supporters . If you can, hire professional pollsters to keep tabs on voters' attitudes; yo u should also pay at- tention to the polls your local newspapers conduc t on the issue. If you have built up any kind of an advertising war chest, use it judiciously. Consult with prof essional \"time buyers\" about the best periods of the day and prog rams for which you should buy time to air your radio spots, and perhaps television ads; compare costs and advantages of purchasing space in newspapers, on bill- boards, and on the backs of buses. Explore cable television for ad- vertising time, where, compared to its commercial counterpart, air time usually sells for a fraction of the cost. And don't ignore the \"free\" form s of advertising: bumper stick- ers, lawn and yard signs, posters, leaflets, door hangers, buttons, and banners. Though the design and printing of these items could be expensive (unless you can get those services do nated), placing them is free. By the way, don't overlook unexpected opportunities for help; one of the last places the Maryland handgun control forces expected to secure PSA pl acements was on the sides of two hundred city buse s. But secure them they did."},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"A CTION AT THE P OLLS 363 Evaluate the Results If you have won, uncork the ch ampagne—but keep a watchful eye over your opponents and any t actics they may use to try to cir- cumvent you (such as challenging the constitutionality of your law in court).

(Those states in clude Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado. Georgia. Idaho, Kansas. Louisi ana. Michigan, Montana. New Jer- sey, Nevada. North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota. Washington, and Wisconsin.)

Specific recall procedures differ fr om state to state, but the gen- eral steps involved in mounting a recall campaign are similar to those taken during an initiative or referendum effort. Concerned activists notify the city, county, or stale government (depending on whom they're trying to recall) of th eir intent to recall; gather a cer- tain number of signatures on pe titions to put the question before voters; have the signatures ve rified; and mount the recall cam- paign. in most states, in order to sp end money on a re call effort, your group must register as a polit ical action committee (PAC) with your state elections office. You must also appoint a treasurer, and record and report to the state elections office any campaign ex- penditures you make. Both the organization initiating the campaign (the \"initiator\") and the voters who sign the petitio ns must be registered in the same electoral district as the official they are trying to oust. When filing an intent to recall an offici al with the state elections office, the initiator often has to submit a statement explaini ng why the re- call demand is being made. The in itiator then has anywhere from three to nine months, depending on the state, to collect signatures showing that a substantial number of people in the official's dis- trict support the recall effort. Recallers print up their own peti tions, but the format and design are strictly regulated and must be approved before the petition is circulated. The number of signatures required to place the official's name on the ballot for a recall vote may be based either on a per- centage of the total numb er of eligible voters in the district or on the number of votes the official received when he or she was elected. After the signatures have been collected and the petitions have been filed, a special election is scheduled for the recall vote. Then both the recall forces as well as those who support the candidate begin to battle, developing and im plementing the same kind of me- dia strategies and get-out-the-vote tactics to recall an official as they would use in waging an in itiative or referendum campaign. In some states, voters must cho ose a new official during the same election in which they recall the existing one. New Jersey is one such state, and that requir ement could have be en the undoing of a group of Atlantic City reside nts seeking to oust their corrupt mayor. Fortunately, it wasn't. Read on."},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"366 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS Recall Roulette It was in many ways a \"num bers game,\" observed a re- porter for the New York Times, employing an appropri- ate metaphor for the ultimate ly successful effort by a group of citizens in the bele aguered gambling resort of Atlantic City, New Jersey, to obtain enough signatures on petitions to force a victorious 1984 recall vote against the mayor. Once a sparkling seaside vacation favorite of well- to-do and middle-class families, Atlantic City had fallen on hard times by the middle 1970s. Its formerly grand hotels had turned dowdy; its fabled Boardwalk attrac- tions seemed tame; visitors stopped coming. With a population of just forty thousand permanent residents, it had become, as the Times put it, \"an urban disaster\" with rampant unemployment and deteriorating housing conditions. The Casino Contro l Act was passed in 1977 to revitalize the city, but le galized gambling only served to increase crime and. many poor residents believed, worsen the housing situation. Attempts to improve the e fficiency of local govern- ment also initially backfired. Voters in 1982 approved a switch from the city's old-time commission form of government to a mayor-co uncil system and held their first direct election for a mayo r in seventy years. By just 359 votes they picked Michae l J. Matthews, a white Democratic state assemblyman, over James L. Usry, a black Republican assistant superintendent of city schools, in balloting that refl ected the city's racial divi- sion. A group calling itself the Citizens Committee to Make Mayor-Council Go vernment Work, formed largely by Usry supporters , believed Matthews was completely uninterested in their problems and doing nothing to help them.

Under New Jersey's compli cated law governing re-"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"A CTION AT THE P OLLS 367 call elections, at least 25 percent of a city's registered voters are required to sign pe titions in order to force a vote to recall a mayor. After one unsuccessful attempt at collecting signatur es, the Citizens Committee decided to start over. On election day, N ovember 9. they launched a second petition drive, conc entrating their efforts on polling places in the black areas of the city, where reg- istered voters who were Usry supporters would likely turn out in large numbers. The organizers distributed fli- ers to the homes in these areas and bought advertising time on local radio stations two days before the Novem- ber 9 election, urging voters to sign the petitions. The petitioners contended that Matthews, then sixteen months into his four-year te rm, not only ignored Atlan- tic City's problems of crim e, poverty, and inadequate public transportation, but spent too much money pro- moting casino interests and had created municipal jobs for political supporters. What the recall petitioners did not know then was that Ma yor Matthews also was under investigation by the U.S. De partment of Justice, which suspected him of having contacts with organized crime and of accepting bribes. On January 3, 1984. the city clerk of Atlantic City ruled that the signature driv e had fallen 257 signatures short of the number needed to force a recall vote. But after some legal wrangling, Superior Court Judge Philip Gruccio ruled on January 24, 19 84, that the recall peti- tions were valid and ordered the city clerk to certify them and set a date for the recall vote. Scheduling such an elec tion became a bureaucratic hassle. The committee had to work in an impossible time frame: According to New Jersey law at that time, the recall vote had to be taken within ninety davs of the first filing of valid petitions, which would be March 2, 1984. But the mayor's attorney s argued that the commit- tee would miss this deadline because the simultaneous election of a new mayor couldn 't be held until April 10, forty-seven days after new candidates' petitions were submitted, and those petitions had not even been printed yet.

Mayor Matthews's attorneys appealed the judge' s finding, but on March 6, the New Jersey State Supreme Court refused to block the recall election. Once agai n, Matthews's chief oppo- nent would be James L. Usry. In what state law required to be a nonpartisan elec- tion, with no political party affiliations listed on the ballot, voters actually had to decide two issues: whether to recall or keep Matthews as mayor and, at the same time, select who they wanted as the city's next mayor.

He might lose the recall vote, which would be decided by a simple majority, and yet simultaneously be reelected as mayor, since that bal- loting could be won by a plurality among Matthews, Usry, and a third candidate, John Pollilo, an activist who was a laborer in the city's Public Works Department. But this irony never came to pass. After just twenty months in office, Mayor Ma tthews lost the recall vote by a three to two margin and was replaced by Usry. Again the voting was along racial lines, but this time Usry had significan tly more campaign money to spend, while Matthews, hobbled by the corruption probe, had far fewer resources and campaigned little. Two weeks after the recall election, Matthews was in- dicted on federal bribery, extortion, and conspiracy charges, and on December 31 , 1984. a federal district court judge sentenced him to fifteen years in prison for extortion, calling him \"a crook . . . who betrayed the people of Atlantic City.\" Unfortunately for the people of Atlantic City, honest government was not in the cards for them with James L.

What Your Nonprofit Group Can and Can't Do Under the Law Before planning your political pr ogram, develop a clear under- standing of what activities you ca n conduct legally. Be aware that if your organization is incorporated as a nonprofit 501(c)(3) under the Internal Revenue Code, it is prohibited from engaging in any partisan political campaign activity, whether on behalf of or in opposition to a candidate for public office. If you want to engage in activities that directly or indirectly sup- port a candidate, consult applicable federal and state law. It is pos- sible to set up organizations separate from your 501(c)(3) to endorse candidates, make camp aign contributions, and provide other political services, but only if your organization conforms to state and federal tax and electoral laws. In general, if your group is classified as a 501(c)(3), follow these basic rules: • Don't endorse a candidate for public office; in fact, don't even recruit a candidate for publ ic office. (Of course, you as an individual can favor one candidate over another.) • Don't publish or distribute statements that either favor or oppose a candidate for public office. • Don't give money to a candidate, political party, or political action committee (PAC); a cont ribution to a political party constitutes indirect support for candidates and an expenditure to influence voter preference. (You may contribute your own money.) • Don't give \"in-kind\" contributions to a candidate, political party, or PAC. such as maili ng, membership or donor lists, office space, staff time, volunteers, or research on the candi- date's opponents. (Again, you may volunteer, but acting as an individual, not as a representative of your organization.) Violation of these rules may caus e the IRS to revoke your tax- exempt status or impose a tax on your organization and its manag- ers. Your 501(c)(3) can. however , provide the following services: • Publish voting records of incumbent members of the U.S. Congress, state legislature, or town council. (A voting record lists selected pieces of legislatio n, a brief description of each,"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"372 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS and an indication of how members voted.) The voting record should not identify which candi dates are up for reelection or relate the voting record to a political camp aign. Neither should it rate candidates or directly compare the voting rec- ord of a candidate you favor to one you oppose . Voting rec- ords that indicate whether the incumbent voted in favor of or against positions taken by your group can be distributed only to your members. Voting record s that include no editorial opinion or an indication of appro val or disapproval of votes may be distributed to the general public and media. • Prepare a questionnaire and circulate it among all candi- dates running for public offi ce. The questionnaire should cover a broad range of issues and avoid all appearance of bias. Results of the questionnaire may be distributed to the general public. • Educate the public about your issues—as long as you do so in a way that is strictly nonpartisan and educational. • Conduct and publicize the results of an issue survey or poll. However, no questions on such an issue survey may re- late to candidate or political party preference. • Organize a public forum to allow all candidates to present their platforms and answer questions from the audience. Make sure you invite all legally qualified candidates from the voting district in which a public forum is focused (see the step-by-step ch ecklist on page 373). • Conduct training workshops on the electoral process. Workshop sessions may focus on giving participants tips on mounting a voter registration drive or get-out-the-vote effort, fund-raising and media traini ng, how the political process works, or how to get elected as a delegate.

They ended up throwing their sup port behind an extremely unlikely candidate: a Minnesota college professor who was both a champion for so cial justice and a budding environmentalist. \"We liked Paul Wellstone from the very beginning; even though he was not well known and had little cam- paign money, we believed in him,\" Ginny remembers.

What he did: The Senator knows that regardless of how much a bill could accomplish (and the figure that he quotes is highly debateable), it will only be effective if it can be enforced . Yet on March 26, Senator Boschwitz voted twice in support of the Heflin -Nickles amendment which would have severly weakened the ability of the EPA and states to investigate Clean Air violations, to enforce air quality standards and to prosecute violators. It also would have shut the door on c itizen's rights to challenge unlawful permits and to sue sources that violat e their permits -- the most effective environmental law and order pr ovision in the Clean Air Act. Even if the bill does achieve 96 per cent of the original bill, it's no thanks to Boschwitz. When strengthe ning amendments were offered to reduce toxic emissions from automobiles (the source of half of all urban air-toxic related cancer cases) and to re instate the EPA's ab ility to institute smog cleanup plans, he voted against them. What he said: \"...the 96 percent bill we are agreeing upon costs about S20 billion a year. The Environment Committee bill would have gotten the last few percentage points by more than doubling the cost.\" (Minneapolis Star-Tribune, March 28) What he did: Senator Boschwitz is well aware (because Sierra Club has told him frequently) that an American Lung Association study determined that the cost of NOT cleaning up our polluted air is $40 to $100 billion a year in health care costs and lost productivity. The costs in terms of ruined resources, such as Lake Superior and smaller lakes in Mi nnesota which are being slowly poisoned by airborne toxics, are difficult to estimate. What he said: \"Over the years, I've learned this about bandwagons: They are often crowded, but frequently they are headed down the wrong road.\" (St. Paul Pioneer Press, March 28 - re ferring to the original Clean Air legislation). What he did: After doing his best to gut the Clean Air Act of 1990, Senator Boschwitz quickly jumped on the environmental bandwagon, voted for the weakened bill and hurried hom e to plant a tree and blow his own horn. Minnesota deserves much better th an Sen. Boschwitz's self-serving political manuevering and election year rhetoric.

There was a particular increase in action at the polls in 1991. when community groups in different lo cales around the country decided to oppose the candidacies of thei r city administrators and city council members who favored inci neration over more environmen- tally benign programs to reduce po llution and solid waste. Several of their stories are told in Facts to Act On: Stopping Waste Incin- erations through Lo cal Self-Reliance, published by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance in Washington, DC. For example, in Oyster Bay, New York, Angelo Delligatti, the in- cumbent Republican chief administ rator, supported a new incinerator as a method for dealing with the garbage crisis, contending that re- cycling alone was not enough to cure the problem. In fact, many ar- gued that the incinerato r would have created a cl assic case of overkill, costing taxpayers $400 million to bui ld and requiring the city to im- port garbage from other cities in order to operate it efficiently. When Lewis Yevoli, a Democrat, vigorously opposed the con- struction of the incinerator, the New York Public Interest Research Group and the Nassau-Suffolk Nei ghborhood Network jumped into the fray. The groups began distri buting flyers atta cking the eco- nomically and environmentally costly incinerator, which they iden- tified with Delligatti. Yevoli won, thanks in large part to the Nassau-Suffolk Neighborhood Network. Elsewhere, articulate citizens ga ve voice to the same sentiments that motivated voters in Oyster Bay.

If y ou're considering engaging in po- litical activity, the best advice is to consult with a lawyer who specializes in the provisions of election statutes in your state.

In such an \"independent expenditure campaign\" the group can have no inter- action with that candidate's official campaign. Mounting an independent expendi ture campaign has several benefits. It allows your organizatio n to inject your issue into the campaign in the way you wish to have it positioned. It enables you to throw more resources behind the candidate of your choice with- out needing to worry about violatin g federal or state election laws.

Advocates of reproductive choice in Colorado eagerly eyed the U.S. Sena te seat being va- cated by Timothy Wirth in 1992 and figured they might just have a shot at send ing Congressman Ben Night- horse Campbell, a staunchly pro-choice candidate, back to Washington as a U.S. senator. The Colorado chapter of the National Abortion Rights Action League (CO/NARAL) took the lead. Af- ter meeting with an outside consultant to develop a statewide campaign strategy th at would include efforts to support candidates for state office who were also pro- choice, organizers decided to mount an independent ex- penditure campaign on behalf of Campbell. The hard work began. In a massive effort to mobilize volunteers, CO/NARAL comm enced amassing a force of committed men and women that eventually amounted to eight hundred supporters available to attend demon- strations, telephone voters, and hand out leaflets and fliers. \"Our people were ev erywhere during this cam- paign,\" said CO/NARAL's Pat Blumenthal. \"It was nuts-and-bolts organizing.\""},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":" 381"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"382    T HE B UILDING B LOCKS A key task was to identif y voters who were pro- choice.

But \"nothing was automatic\" with the press, recalls Blumenthal. \"We had to work hard to get reporters to show up at our press confer ence.\" CO/NARAL sent out press releases, made follow-up calls to reporters, and of- fered to set up one-on-one in terviews to generate the successful coverage they did.

A Word About Volunteers Volunteers are the backbone of ev ery campaign. In fact, dedi- cated, enthusiastic volunteers are probably among a campaign's most important assets (and this is as true for an issue campaign as it is for one focused on politics). Few campaign treasuries can affo rd to pay workers to do the hundreds of jobs that voluntee rs do for free. But even if they could, it probably wouldn't be necessary, as long as volunteers are treated with respect and made to fe el like an integral part of the campaign. Even more than salaried workers, volunteers bring to a campaign a dedication and a willingn ess to work that are indis- pensable. How do you get people to volunt eer? Many citizens are just waiting lo be asked. The key is to convince pote ntial volunteers— people who already support your candidate or your cause—that they can make an important cont ribution to the campaign with their time and services. Volunteers may be motivated by many different reasons. Some are curious about the political process (more than one person who volunteered to work on Bill C linton's presidential campaign in"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"384 T HE B UILDING B LOCKS 1992 did so to \"be a part of history\"). Others have definite per- sonal political aspirations, so they want to make contacts now for a later effort of their own. Still others become volunteers because they care passionately about an issue and want to make it a focal point of the campaign. Staunch advocat es of the candidate will want to do everything possible to get him or her elected. (I volun- teered to work on a congressional race in 1974 because I had just moved to Denver. Colorado, and thought it would be a good way to make friends; I also supported the candidate. Later, I worked on an initiative effort in Colorado to ban the underground testing of nuclear weapons because I strongl y believed weapons testing had to stop.) Volunteers need good direction and supervision. It's better to give volunteers a variety of options than to ask people to do the same task day in and day out. And give them a job they can finish. \"Call these fifty names\" works be tter than \"Call as many people on this list as you possibly can.\" Here are some other tips for boosting volunteerism in your cam- paign: • Make the campaign headquarters as pleasant as possible to work in. Inevitably the office will get messy and crowded, but try to keep it from getting dirty and so jammed that no one has a place to sit down. • Ask volunteers to commit to a certain day and time. Let them know you are counting on th em to work when they say they will. • Invite volunteers to regular briefings on the status of the campaign. Whenever possible, have the candidate or the candidate's spouse personally thank the volunteers for their hard work. Make volunteers feel important; the more a part of the group they feel, th e more they'll volunteer. • Recruit volunteers from many places: interest groups, high schools and colleges, youth groups and civic associations, seniors organizations, political parties, labor unions, and so on. At a large event, set up a recruitment table to get names and addresses of people who want to help. You can also ad- vertise very cheaply in weekly newspapers and \"shoppers\" for volunteers. Always recruit more volunteers than you need, since some are more dedicated and reliable than others—and all of them"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"A CTION AT THE P OLLS 385 can be helpful. Undertaking an activity for which you need thirty volunteers requires you to recruit seventy-five. • Once the election is over, make sure you thank all your volunteers. Then work to integrate th e new volunteers into your organization. Many of th e skills they acquired getting a candidate elected are the same skills they can use in raising awareness around your issue an d advancing your issue agen- da throughout the year. Keep track of those who volunteer and the work they're willing to do by having each r ecruit complete a volunteer pledge card like the one on page 386.

Twenty-one states have al ready implemented such a system, and more states either ask license applicants if they would like to register or have registration forms available for the public to pick up at state offices. Another provision of the motor voter bill is that states must pro- vide opportunities for citizens to register by giving them forms when they sign up for services at certain federal agencies. This provision is designed to register people who do not drive; ten states already use this method. Twenty-nine states offer residents ways to register by mail.

Set an achievable numerical goal from the beginning, to inspire volunteers and serve as a guide for evalu- ation. Select a time period, targ et a group, pick sites, and so on. Focus on groups of citizens most likely to need help with voter registration, such as those who are newly eligible to vote, senior citizens, those with low incomes, or minorities. • Know the law. Become familiar with t he federal, state, and local laws that govern voter registration in your community. Voter registration practices—methods, deadlines, permissible sites, the role of volunteers—d iffer from state to state and often vary among local jurisdicti ons in the same state. Federal laws such as the Voting Rights Act and the Voting Access for the Elderly and Hand icapped Act protect the rights of minorities and other citizens to vote. Seek legal assistance if you believe that state or local registration practices violate citi- zens' voting rights. Be sure to keep your registration drive nonpartisan. • Work with election officials. Make sure local election offi- cials know about your plans. In some places, you will need their help to gel voter registration forms, to register voters at special sites, or to train and deputize volunteer registrars. In other places, only official registrars may be allowed to register voters. If you will need large numbers of forms or deputy registrars, inform election officials as earl y as possible and in writing so they can make any necessary ar rangements. If election officials are uncooperative or do not prov ide assistance allowed by state election laws, and you have made a good faith effort to work with them, seek legal assistance. • Form a coalition.

Consider fe stivals, fairs, sporting events, schools, colleges, public transit stops, or downtowns and shop- ping centers. Select your sites to make the best use of volun- teers. Schedule volunteers for peak attendance times. Visit sites ahead of time, and select the most visible and accessible places to station volun teers. Consider the needs of disabled people.

Impress volunteers with their responsibility to protect the right to vot e of the citi- zens they are registering by filling out the forms correctly and returning them promptly to electi on officials. Include training in techniques for approaching potentia l registrants and in messages that will motivate citizens to register.

Take your candidate's message directly to voters by handing out campai gn literature at fairs, farm- er's markets, shopping malls, rallies, and anywhere else where people congregate. • Monitor the media. Volunteers can keep files of favorable and unfavorable news coverage the candidate receives, mon- itor radio and television news for stories abou t the candidate and his or her opponent, track local issues about which the candidate should be aware, or identify events the candidate might want to attend. If the candidate is going to be on a call-in talk show, volu nteers can be ready to call in with sup- portive questions and comments. • Write letters to the editor. Volunteers can express their sup- port for the candidate or their distaste for his or her opponent through letters to th e editor of the loca l daily and weekly newspapers. • Research. Campaigns can always use more ammunition— about the candidate's opponent and facts and figures concerning especially important issues facing the com- munity. • Recruit volunteers.

Ask your friends and neighbors to he lp out, call lists of people who belong to groups sympathetic to the candidate, and sign up people who attend events where the candidate is speaking. • Prepare position papers on issues you're knowledgeable about.

Position papers can be distributed to the media, passed out at debates, and included in the packet of information ca ndidates send to donors and the general public. • Organize media events.

Overwhelmingly reelected in 1992 with 71 percent of the vote—higher than any other Senate Democrat—she now is the first woman in her party to become a mem- ber of the previously all-male Senate Democratic leader- ship. KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THE CANDIDATE AFTER THE ELECTION As soon as possible, arrange to meet with your newly elected representative. Make sure he or she realizes how much work you did on behalf of the campaign and how important the vole of your constituents was to its success. If you can, work on or with the o fficial's transition staff to begin implementing the policies the offici al advocated during the cam- paign. Arrange briefings for the official on your issue and with your is- sue experts. Introduce the official to other elected officials your or- ganization has supported. If the can didate has a campaign debt, help to retire it by planning a fund -raiser or making a direct con- tribution. If your candidate lost , make sure he or she knows that you're still supportive. Meet with the cand idate soon after the election to determine the candidate's plans and to discuss how you can con- tinue to work together. Even if your candidate lost, you should try to establish a work- ing relationship with the winner. No matter who's in office, you're going to have to work with them—at least until the next election rolls around."},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"A CTION AT THE P OLLS 397 ACTION AT THE POLLS DO's and DOIM'Ts • Do volunteer as an individual to help elect candidates you support or defeat those you oppose. .
