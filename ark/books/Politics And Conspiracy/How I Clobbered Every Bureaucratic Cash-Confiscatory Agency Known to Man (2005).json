Most wanted to ‘kill the messenger’ because their having been so conned by the alleged ‘authorities’ their entire lives was too painful to contemplate. Those with neither eyes to see nor ears to hear wanted to argue with me. Many suggested they were aware, yet upon further discussion they admitted to not really knowing. Our mind is of 3 categories: what we know, what we don’t know, and what we don’t know we don’t know. Not knowing is unfortunate; not knowing that we don’t know is tragic. - W. Erhart. Some actually did know about the fraudulent banking system and yet felt already defeated. They remain part of the problem by refusing to become part of the solution. The ultimate ignorance is the rejection of something you know nothing about and refuse to investigate. - Dr. Wayne Dyer I concluded that, unfortunately, only a few want to hear how to become free, stop identifying with their false beliefs, do what they want to do (instead of ‘working for a living’), and live in joy which is what we are designed to do. I felt as if I were my own minority group - I truly do want to know that which I don’t want to know. Most want security over freedom. As most people identify with their beliefs, giving them up would present the fear, ‘who would I BE?’ If they were to open their minds, drop their preconceived notions, their psychological prejudices, let go of the concept that their beliefs are who they are , they might become enlightened. Millions of unconscious people are not taking responsibility for their inner peace. - Eckhart Tolle. Needless to say, suggesting we have been conned into playing an insidious game which is destroying our lives, our futures, our fellowship, our spirituality, and our true natures, will meet with non-receptive minds. Consequently, in exasperation one night I resolved that my book would be futile - a waste of my time and energy. I declared I would put my efforts back into developing my Energy Psychology practice. In the middle of the night I was awakened by a voice saying, “Secret Oral Teachings”. I thought, “I’ll remember” and went back to sleep. Later I heard it again , and then again upon awakening I heard, “Secret Oral Teachings” at which point I leapt out of bed and went to my books and put my hand on a small brown book which I’d owned for 20 years and never read, entitled, Secret Oral Teachings in Tibetan Buddhist Sects by Alexandra David-Néel and Lama Yongden (1967). Within the first eight pages I read about the hesitation of the Buddha, before beginning His Mission: “I have discovered a profound truth, difficult to perceive, difficult to understand, accessible only to the wise. “Human beings busy themselves in the vortex of the world and find their pleasure. It will be difficult for men to understand the law of the concatenation of causes and effects, the suppression of the samskaras (ideas that one forms which depend upon ignorance). “Of what use to reveal to men that which I have discovered at the price of laborious efforts? Why should I do so? - This doctrine cannot be understood by those filled by desire and hatred .. it is mysterious, deep; hidden from the vulgar mind. If I proclaim it and men are unable to understand it, the only result will be fatigue and annoyance for me.” Brahma Sahampati exhorts the Buddha to conquer His hesitation: “May the Venerable One preach the Doctrine! There are beings whose spiritual eyes are hardly 3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"darkened by light dust, these will understand the Doctrine. In the land of Magadha a false doctrine has prevailed up to the present, elaborated by men whose minds were contaminated (by ignorance). Now open to them the gate of Immortality (literally, of the deathless). “Arise, O Victorious One ! Travel through-out the world, O Chief of Pilgrims (beings who wander in the round of successive births and deaths). There are some who will understand Thee.” The Buddha insisted strongly on the necessity of examining the propositions put forward by Him, and of understanding them personally before accepting them as true. The ancient texts leave no doubt on this point: “Do not believe on the strength of traditions even if they have been held in honour for many generations and in many places; do not believe anything because many people speak of it; do not believe on the strength of sages of old times; do not believe that which you have yourselves imagined, thinking that a god has inspired you. Believe nothing which depends only on the authority of your masters or of priests. After investigation, believe that which you have yourselves tested and found reasonable, and which is for your good and that of others.” “Doubt is an incitement to research, and research is the path to true knowledge.” “Why are these teachings secret? Does that mean I can’t write and tell about them?” “No, Alexandra, these teachings are not called ‘secret’ because it is forbidden to talk about them. They are ‘secret’ because so few who hear them understand.” *** Immediately I began writing, yet from a completely different perspective from my previous attempts. Following is the result of this inspiration. I ask that you take the Buddha’s suggestion - “investigate, believe what is reasonable and for your good and that of others.” I was asked - but there no words: it was a straight mental instantaneous communication - ‘What had I done to benefit or advance the human race? - The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying - Sogyal Rinpoche I have determined that writing this book is my responsibility. *** 4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Truth Each progressive spirit is opposed by a thousand mediocre minds appointed to guard the past. ~ Maurice Maeterlinck Contempt, prior to complete investigation, enslaves men to ignorance. - Dr. John Whitman Ray In a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act. - George Orwell If you want to make someone angry, tell him a lie; if you want to make him furious, tell him the truth.

Any “Logics” course will teach that we can have a completely logical system which reaches a logical conclusion yet it is not true because it is based upon a false premise. The mind seems not to care if it reacts from something that is untrue as long as it feels certainty . So, the best position from which to learn is from ‘uncertainty’ - ‘being in the question’.

After some perfunctory chit-chat he invited her to his house where she remained the entire weekend. The sex was great; the conversation was fabulous. They discussed their respective attitudes on every conceivable subject; they reminisced over their childhoods, school, and previous lovers. They talked about every member of their families; they described in detail their interests - many of which they shared, their occupations, and their friends. Throughout these intimate conversations they made love. He was a fabulous cook and so after going to the market on Saturday morning, he created sumptuous meals for the remainder of her visit. Each mentioned what s/he wanted in a mate and the other corroborated. There was even talk of a future together. By Sunday brunch, each admitted to feeling as if s/he had known each other his/her entire life and quite possibly even prior to this lifetime. Indeed, they had found their soul-mates. After supper on Sunday night when the end of their most ecstatic weekend was about to end, snuggled up watching a romantic movie, promising never to let the other go, she asked, “How much money do you make?” His response was, “That’s personal.” What is it about $$$ that keeps us from being with each other? I suggest that $$$ is the most glaring evidence of our belief that we are separate from one another. *** INTRODUCTION Remember the bumper sticker, ‘QUESTION AUTHORITY’. Everyone said it yet no one did anything about it. I did; I recognized it. I had known from a very young age that I, and none other, was my own and only authority. It seems I simply spent my life evidencing it. I never, ever, listened to anyone outside myself. The problem was that I also never listened to me. It took me decades to learn to trust my intuition. The most important thing we will ever learn is who we are and this will require that we change our minds about who we think we are. This will require that we throw out everything we think we know and replace it with what we have intuitively always known. We must listen only to what our intuition intends for us. 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"PART I WHAT HAPPENED Around 1996 I noticed that my family was getting broker by the month and my fear level increased exponentially. When I had to pay the telephone bill with a credit card I knew we were in trouble. I knew that the entire credit card game was a scam due to my having read, back in 1990, a book called, Truth In Money by Theodore R. Thoren. I also knew from my study of A Course In Miracles (ACIM) that nothing is as it seems. Still, I didn’t know what to do about the banks telephoning every day demanding ‘payment’. I detected, by the desperation in their voices, that at some subconscious level they also knew that I didn’t really have to pay any credit card debt, I just didn’t know how to remove myself from the ostensible obligation. If I had been truly obliged to pay credit card debt, these callers would have been kinder and just asked when and how I might be able to send them part of what was ‘owing’. Their rage was the tip-off that they were bluffing. One day, as I was out running, I burst into tears and was forced to ask my Creator what to do. I knew, from A Course In Miracles that ‘God’ would not put $50,000 on the kitchen table in the morning for me to pay the credit card bills. I also knew that my real problem was not the fact of the matter, rather, how I felt about it. As Krishnamurti said, There are no problems apart from the mind. If I could just change my mind about what seemed to be a problem I felt certain I could resolve it. So I found myself asking the Holy Spirit, et al, to change my mind about my circumstances. Seek not to change the world; seek only to change your mind about the world. - ACIM The next day a woman rang me requesting a session of Rapid Eye Technology (energy healing). Her anxiety was that the IRS had been confiscating her husband’s veterans benefits to settle her ‘debt’ with them. All I could tell her, from my years of studying $$$, taxes, etc. was, “You know there is no law compelling you to pay tax on your income.” She DID know! I was delighted. I also told her, “If it makes you feel any better, you’re not alone - the credit card banks think I owe them $40,000. I know that I don’t really owe them, I just don’t know how to prove it.” Lo and behold, she said, “You just send the letters.” I leapt from my chair - my prayer had indeed been answered - ask and ye shall receive. She then produced a series of letters, the drift of which was to request the bank to provide me with three things: 1. validation of the debt (the actual accounting); 2. verification of their claim against me (a sworn affidavit or even just a signed invoice); and, 3. a copy of the contract binding both parties. I was to write, as soon as I received these three documents, that I would be happy to pay any financial obligation I might lawfully owe. The banks can’t validate the debt because they never sustained a loss; they can’t verify any claim against me because I am not the NAME they are billing - more on this later. They can’t produce a copy of the contract because one doesn’t exist. What exists is an unenforceable unilateral contract. What the banks refer to as ‘your contract with us’ is not a valid bilateral agreement since the four requirements of a lawful, binding contract were not met on the credit card ‘application’, namely: 1. Full Disclosure (we are not told that we are creating the credit with our signature); 2. Equal Consideration (they bring nothing to the table, hence they have nothing to lose); 3. Lawful Terms and Conditions (they are based upon fraud); and 4. Signatures of the Parties (corporations can’t sign because they have no right to contract as they are legal fictions). Credit cards are win/ win for the banks and lose/ lose for everyone else - it is the slickest con game on the planet. My writing the letters worked for all but one account. The bank filed suit. I poured over all kinds of legal nonsense, none of which matters - how we handle banks now works beautifully, yet back in 1996, we were still fumbling - and so, since the card was in a NAME similar to that of my sons’ father, the bank came after him. He did not want to go to court and since I regarded this as research, not to mention adventure, I went in his place. (If you’re not living on the edge you’re taking up too much space.) When the administrator (aka ‘judge’) called his name, I stood up and said, “I’m here about that matter.” A year previous I had used a similar tactic when I went to court over a ‘seat belt violation’ and was promptly thrown into jail for stating that my name was nowhere on the ticket or the summons. Although I was accurate, I didn’t know the next step. This time I knew what I was doing. The District Court ‘Judge’ asked 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"me my name. I responded, “If I tell you, will I have entered into a contract with you?” He became irate. I knew I was onto something. He furiously said, “I’m going to ask you again; what is your name?” I said the same thing again and was literally, bodily tossed from court. On my way out I told the bailiff, “I believe I hit a nerve.” I was ecstatic. As it turned out, I had indeed hit on the only issue which matters. CONTRACT. Contract Law is the only law. There is no Constitutional Law, Bill of Rights, Charter of Rights and Freedoms, no codes, rules, regulations, ordinances, statutes, by-laws, or anything else which most people think of as ‘law’ which applies to free, sovereign people. They all apply only to corporate entities. There is only one law which applies to us: the law which protects the life, liberty, rights, and property of all living souls. That which causes us to think that all these ‘laws’ apply to us is the contracts/ agreements we have made, either wittingly or unwittingly. If there is no contract there is no case. Contract is the law. Contractual Financial Liability is all that matters; and it must be proven. Authority When I was in grade 3 (1957), my teacher was telling us about Magellan being the first white man to circum-navigate the globe. This wasn’t particularly difficult for me to accept, and yet, suddenly I sat back in my chair and looked at my fellow students and was hit by the realization, “She could tell us anything .” From then on, I became suspect of everything which might be construed as propaganda or about which my mother had warned me, “Consider the source”. By that she meant, always look for a vested interest. Question the credibility of the source. Who says so? Quo warranto (by what authority)? Who stands to gain? This is now commonly known as, “Follow the money”. From that day on, I became highly suspicious of the true purpose of my being ‘schooled’. For those interested in ‘education’ I suggest you read John Taylor Gatto and in particular, The Underground History of American Education . Schooling is a huge waste of time, talent, energy, and creativity. There is little to learn, that school offers, until we are out doing what we want to be doing. Apprenticeship worked which is why the PTB (powers-that-be) don’t want anyone apprenticing anymore, they want us in gov't-operated schools - to waste our lives learning what no one wants to learn, and what no one needs to know. The entire concept of life is that we learn as we go; schooling is anathema to this natural concept. Gatto wrote, Children allowed to take responsibility and given a serious part in the larger world are always superior to those merely permitted to play and be passive. At the age of twelve, Admiral Farragut got his first command. I was in fifth grade when I learned of this. Had Farragut gone to my school he would have been in seventh. A psychologist once told me, “Don't ever do anything for any male over the age of 10 unless you are specifically asked.” We are destroying our children by prolonging childhood. This is by design of the corporate monsters, Dewey et al. Kids ought to be out doing what they want by age 12 and we ought to be available ONLY for counsel. I told my boys that in my books, age 13 is the age of majority. It seems the purpose of the so-called educational system is not to educate us to be free-thinking natural beings, but rather to distort what is really going on in the world and also convince us that we will be happy if we just get a good education in order to get a good job in order to make a lot of money in order to buy as many worthless items as possible, and thereby become dependent upon them, in order to create as much debt as possible, thereby enslaving us on all counts - programming, slave-labour, debt, addiction, and ultimate confiscation of property - the first plank of the Communist Manifesto. Please keep in mind this goal as you read and it will become clear that not only is this precisely what is going on but also that there is a lawful and spiritual way out of it. Your peace of mind depends upon it - and isn’t this really all we truly want? I knew at age nine, when my parents pulled the “Eat your dinner; there are children starving in China” routine, that there was something drastically wrong. Certainly the mere fact that someone knew that there were starving children meant they had the means to do something about it and I noticed nothing was being done about it - by those with the means. Sure, CARE packages, which depended upon the generosity of the people , were being sent yet I soon learned that the reason the problem continued is because someone wanted it that way. It would have been easy to correct if indeed the PTB wanted it corrected - same as every other ‘problem’ in the world. So I learned at a very tender age that the entire system is ‘designed not to work’ and hence, ‘things are not what they seem’. At age 9 I experienced my first commercial success. I wanted a hula hoop and on my way home from 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"school I went to the local smoke and gift shop to look longingly at a big, red hula hoop hanging on the wall. The cost was $2.98. I was shocked and appalled. I told my father, who happened to work in the ‘plastic pipe’ business, the cost of the hula hoop, and he explained to me that it cost only pennies to make. I returned to the store the next day to stare at it with the thought, ‘if only...’. Finally, I said to the store owner, “I really want that red hula hoop. I think $2.98 is too much for a child my age to pay.” On my way home from school the same day I went in and noticed that he had dropped the price to $1.98 so I bought it. If you don’t ask, you don’t get. In 1968 I told my mother, “I don’t know what to do with my $$$; I don’t trust the banks”. I don’t know why I might have made this comment because my father thought the banks were great so I didn’t get any cues from him. Au contraire, when my brother failed a grade at school, he told him, “You just lost $10,000 dollars.” Clearly he saw life as the means to accumulate $$$ and anything which ‘went wrong’ in life was measured thus. Mum looked at me askance at first and then said, “You’re probably right. Buy ‘things’. Every day the value of ‘money’ diminishes through inflation and pretty soon you will rather have things than valueless money.” I think she anticipated another depression. If she were alive today, I feel certain she would be very aware of the imminent economic collapse. I like to think she might see this as ‘good news’ as opposed to how most people see it, if indeed they see it at all. When I was twenty I worked for a bank. After six weeks I told the teller next to me that I figured out how to rob the bank and I described to her my methods. I’d tell you but I don’t recall and besides it would no longer be true due to EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer) banking. I thought she would be excited but instead she was clearly horrified and the next day I was given notice to leave. My father always told me, “Get yourself with a good company”. This, coming from a man whose ‘good company’ had him working nights when he was 59, fueled my position that we are meant to do what we love to do... and nothing else. After I dropped out of university I went to work for American Airlines. After a month I told a fellow employee who had trained with me that I wanted to get my own place and then asked, “But how will I pay the rent when I no longer have the job?” She told me I was silly to worry about that. Within a month our training class of 5 was laid off. Each of the others was hired back; I was not. I learned later that I had scored too high on the aptitude test. Some hotshot executive had discovered that I was not within the ‘hiring range’ for that particular job. Its not so much that I am brilliant as much as apparently I am equally left and right-brained, which is somewhat uncommon. Most people do well in either the Math or the English part of an aptitude test, but not both, as I had done, and so my score was off the charts. Now I had this expensive apartment. I wished that I had listened to my intuition. I was always a Maverick. I told a friend, who happened to work as a teacher, that if I ever have children I will teach them that they are their own authority and never to let any teacher intimidate them. She was aghast and said in no uncertain terms that this was the problem in the schools today - no respect for authority. I mentioned that there is no authority outside oneself. I am my own authority. I added that teachers are part of the agenda which programs kids into believing that someone else knows what’s best for them. There is no limit to the agencies, professionals, and bureaucrats which exist solely to dictate how we ought to live our lives. Teachers, doctors, government, ministers, and bankers spend time, funds, and effort intending to convince children what to think. I determined that my children would think for themselves. Joseph Chilton Pierce, in his book, Magical Child , advises parents, “Children think their parents are perfect, so use this and be an example. As soon as we go to an ‘authority’ (doctor, teacher, minister) we lose our power. The child wants to think of us as omnipotent since he knows he can become that ... if we are.” I read that J. P. Morgan had said, “I don’t want a lawyer to tell me what I cannot do; I hire an attorney to tell me how to do what I want to do.” So I told my boys, “I understand that you don’t want me to tell you what you can’t do; you hired me to tell you how to do what you want to do.” Alas, I have since learned that my boys are too subjected to mind-manipulation (school, TV, friends) to grant me any credibility. (I was a great parent before I had children.) Parenthood is like a 20-year sentence, except in jail they let you read. The best thing about having children is finally getting to understand why we (all) felt neglected by our parents. We have, as they had, lives to lead and we children were only a part of it. As children, we presumed we were their entire purpose in life. Feeling the neglect was painful only because we blamed our lack of worth for any inattention. When we have our own children and realize, that as much as we love our children, they still are not our entire lives although for awhile we are theirs. It allows us to see it wasn’t our lack of worth which kept our parents from focussing on us 100% of the time, it was that they had a life of which we were only a part. About thirty years ago I heard Peter Fonda say, on a talk show, “Try not paying your taxes and find 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"out who owns your house.” My eyelids flew open like Venetian Blinds and I suddenly knew that I knew this and somewhere hidden in my psyche was the entire story. As a teenager, I worked for both corporations and smaller, privately-owned companies. Never conscious of it until much later, I noticed that while working for a small firm or real living souls, I would faithfully put 10¢ into the jar for coffee when doing so was based upon the ‘honour system’. The goods belonging to the privately-owned company were not mine until I compensated them in some way. Much later I realized that when I had worked for corporations, I would rob them to the extent of my ability. I think intuitively I knew that anything a corporation ostensibly ‘owned’ was already mine, because I had pre-paid everything (more on this later). For awhile I put it down to anonymity, but it wasn’t that; it was the fact that I knew it was mine ... and I was accurate. Again, my intuition was correctly guiding me and this is why I never felt any guilt. In the early 1970s I was in the car with my father and brother. My father was telling my brother to put the ‘maximum allowable’ into RRSP as it was a great investment as he won’t pay tax on that amount until he takes it from the account. I’m surprised my father didn’t see the problem with this since he was so acutely aware of the insidious graduated income tax not to mention the worst tax of all - inflation. My bro would pay much more tax later than he ever would then. Again, I recall sitting back and looking out the window and intuitively knowing that not only would he never see any of his RRSP investments but also he would never see any of his company pensions. If you think I am inaccurate, because you are already receiving yours, you must be older than I am. I’m referring to us baby boomers; we’re in our 50s and we will not see our pensions at age 65. If you feel fear from reading that, be certain to recognize that your fear is not about your future; it is about your belief in your powerlessness. Why would you think that there being no government financial security in your future has anything to do with who you are and what you can do? I’ll get to this in Part 3. In 2002 my friend told me she was frantic about $$$, in particular, paying the mortgage. She flailed her arms in frustration when I apprised her that there was nothing to pay, not to mention nothing with which to pay. She said, “If I can just hold out another 12 years (age 65) I can collect my pension. I told her she’ll never see it. She dismissed me with a wave of her hand. All the property of this country now belongs to the state and will be used for the good of the state. - FDR, 1933 For you Canadians who are feeling smug that this is not happening in Canada, consider that Canada is the 13th Federal Reserve District. Both USA/ CA, the corporations, are subject to the jurisdiction of the Crown/ Vatican. Can/Am is not ‘a free country’. We are not free until we realize ‘who we are’. What I write applies either to America (Canada and the united States) or to USA/ CA (corporations). There are certainly differences in our cultures but don’t kid yourself about jurisdiction. I always attributed to my cynicism these intuitive glimpses into the future until I learned that in 1993, in Canada, Bill C-124 was passed which states, approximately: In order to pay the national debt (as if there were any national debt) the government might be required, and now has the legislation in place, to confiscate the pensions, RRSPs, investments, property, and all other tangible assets of the people. This scheme is a ruse. I’ll explain later how the Feds will legally (not lawfully) be able to do this. Right now though, remember, the entire raison d’etre of the government is to confiscate your property under the guise of your having lost it because you couldn’t pay your ‘debts’. Unfortunately, most people have fallen for this and most will continue to do so until they have nothing left which, I’ll explain later, is not as horrific as you might think ... so lighten up. Living souls cannot have ‘debt’. There is nothing to fear about the imminent collapse of the global financial prison. - David Icke In 1975, after my mum died, I went into nurse’s training. During my psychiatric rotation I had a patient called Bruce, who had been diagnosed “paranoid schizophrenic”. I’d always thought schizophrenics simply interpreted the illusion of life on this planet a bit more accurately than the rest of us and that there was nothing ‘wrong’ with them; au contraire, there might be something wrong with someone who would label another as ‘paranoid schizophrenic’. My teacher asked one morning, “Mary, tell us about your patient; what’s wrong with Bruce?” “ Nothing is wrong with Bruce. He is a typical 19 year-old - a few drugs, a few problems .... nothing wrong.” She was incensed by my attitude and raged, “Of course there is or he wouldn’t be here.” I didn’t have to take this nonsense so I got up and left the room. On my way out I wondered what I was intending to do. Ah! - I’ll look through his chart for ‘evidence’ that there is “nothing wrong with Bruce”. Just as I went for his chart I noticed that a doctor was writing in it. I said, “Just the man I want to see! What exactly is wrong with Bruce?” He answered, “Nothing; I’ve 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"just discharged him.” Do I have horseshoes up my ass, or what? So, I said, “Will you go and tell my teacher this; she thinks I’m being contrary; and he did. I was a big hit with my fellow students. I realized just how important my timing had been. When another incident re-enforced this I vowed to act accordingly from then on. After a year or two of the frustrating nonsense of nursing - Idealism is what precedes experience; cynicism is what follows. - D Wolf - I was bored and thought I ought to go to Florida for the winter. I was hitch-hiking through Florida and I was picked up by a truck driver. They are well-known for being safe so without compunction I climbed aboard. After a bit, he told me he was going to stay at the Ramada Inn and carry on in the morning. It was only late afternoon so I thought I could make it to Orlando and told him that I was going to continue hitching. He graciously told me that if I didn’t get a ride I could join him for supper. He would even put me up for the night because he always got a room with two beds. On the road I noticed coming towards me from the direction I was heading, a man leaning out of the window of his VW bug. He got off the highway, swung around and stopped beside me. He was blond and blue-eyed, with a smile to beat the band. He asked me where I was headed. “Obviously not the same place you’re headed.” I told him I was from Toronto and was headed for Orlando. He mentioned he was going to an art show and that if I were still here on his way back, he’d pick me up since he lived in Orlando. This was laughable and I told him I would not be out here for long, because if I didn’t get a ride I had planned to go into the Ramada Inn and let the truck driver buy me dinner. He shrugged and waved good-bye. I did not get a ride and so I did get dinner with the truck driver. Then we went along to the bar where he proceeded to get very drunk. I told him I was going to bed and got the key. He stumbled in after another hour. I was in bed with my clothes on because I had become wary when I saw him so drunk. After several lewd propositions I told him if he said one more thing to me I’d have to leave. His last ditch was, “How would you like to wake up in the morning with a smile on your face and $50 richer?” That did it. I jumped up, grabbed my stuff and stomped out. If I couldn’t get a ride at 4:30 in the afternoon, where did I think I was going at 11:30 at night? I quickly thought I could approach a kind, married, business man in the bar - you know the type - one with a daughter my age.... and tell him my horror story. Men are always happy to protect young women from other lecherous men. Alas, there was not a soul in the bar. In a panic I just threw open the door to the bar which led outside. Coming up the driveway at that instant was the handsome man in the VW bug. “Hey, Toronto! Where are you going?” I threw my bag into the back seat, my body into the passenger seat, and said, “With you.” I learned from that incident that if I just be myself, everything works out, particularly my timing; it was precise. Due to this realization one would think that I might have the moxy to do anything I wanted with no fear of failure. Alas, the fear had been so ingrained over the years that I regarded that episode as a fluke rather than an example of the possibility for all circumstances in which I found myself. All I had to do is remember who I am. I notice that when there appears to be any struggle at all to do anything I feel compelled to do or accomplish, I can count on the timing being off. When I just “do what’s next”, everything works out. I worked as a nurse, on and off for 25 years ... ‘on’ when I needed the cash, and ‘off’ when I was bored and frustrated by the unethical nature of it all ... I never saw or knew of anyone - patient, friend, or relative - who died of cancer. They all died of the ‘medical treatment’ for cancer. Nurse’s training was cheap, brief, and I could go anywhere I wanted - like California, which I did. In the early 80’s I was earning $22 (USD) an hour. When the IRS sent me a bill for a tax they thought I owed, I smelled a rat. We’ve all heard horrendous IRS stories. Since we are programmed to fear, these stories can influence our behaviour, however, if we are aware that fear itself is the killer (“do not take counsel from your fears”) then we can notice it and behave in a manner which works for us. So I challenged them. I noticed that they could not support their claim. I also noticed that the amount they claimed I owed rose dramatically with each letter and for no apparent reason other than they added penalties, late fees, interest, etc. The higher the amount, the clearer their scheme became to me. I also noticed that every letter came not only from a different entity but also with no signature, thereby rendering it an invalid commercial instrument. All invoices, in order to be valid, must be signed by someone able to bind the corporation in contract. We are not lawfully bound to pay anything which is unsigned. Think of all the ‘statements’ you receive which read ‘amount due’, yet have no clout as they are incomplete. I shan’t outline my interim steps, yet here’s the drift about what allowed me finally to deal with the IRS. I admit it took years, however it’s interesting that of all the people with whom I not only chatted about the IRS but also treated for anxiety over the IRS, I noticed they all had one thing in common: the IRS sent them a bill, the amount of which was above and beyond anything credible. Anyone with a brain can see that 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"this is what blows their cover. If they sent a bill for $2,000, one might be inclined to pay it. But a bill for $23,000 when one earns only $30,000 is simply laughable. It is this which gets people to declare they will never file or pay again. There are now over 45 million people in the uSA who are no longer filing 1040s. Those who file 1041s can get back all the tax they have ever paid. I am just now learning about this. I’m sure there is something similar, that of filing for a ‘Trust’, in Canada. IRS agents now openly admit that they have what is termed, “fishing expeditions” whereby they send out a few million “Notice of Assessment” just to see who bites. The amount is not enough to create so much angst as to get questioned on it yet enough to make it worth their while. Most people will figure that a $2,000 bill from the IRS is not worth fighting and/or going to jail over so they pay it. If the bill were $25,000 all hell would break loose. Imagine $2,000 from several million unquestioning taxpayers; wow. I actually began to suspect that IRS agents, at some unconscious level, want to expose their own fraudulent activities - clear their conscience, so to speak, and this is why they send out these inane letters. Yet, as David Icke says, “Those at the top of the pyramid are the manipulators of human consciousness. They are sentient programs with no soul.” So, there is not one iota of divine intervention at the IRS/CRA; rather this is a case of four things; 1. they are desperate, 2. they are surreptitious, 3. they get a percentage of the $$$ they recover, 4. they require our fear in order to stay alive. They think the extortive ‘total amount owing’ frightens us when in fact it is laughable. 1. They are so desperate that they will do weird things which blow their cover. The IRS/CRA is so frantic about collecting cash in order to pay the interest on the loan from the World Banksters that it will even behave in a self-defeating manner. It frantically sends out statements from every remotely conceivable source - have you ever noticed that you never get one from the same person/ office more than once? This is because they are scrambling and no one knows what anyone else is doing, not to mention that the name at the bottom of the statement is the name of the computer which generated the letter. There is no living soul behind the letter. The timing is ludicrous and the wording is ridiculous as letters are actually based upon an IRS Manual called How to Write a Non-Response Response . Take a look at some of their letters and you’ll realize that they have been composed by a group of monkeys, not unlike those whom Bob Newhart describes in his skit, An Infinite Number of Monkeys . “If you take an infinite number of monkeys and an infinite number of typewriters, over an infinite period of time, they will ultimately type all the great works. Needless to say there would have to be people hired to monitor what the monkeys were turning out. Here is a day in the life of one of these monitors: ‘Oh, Harry, I think we might have something here! “To be ... or not ... to be ....... that is the ......... Gazornin Plan.”’” Next time you get a letter from the IRS/CRA, just picture this same scene in your mind and you’ll know with whom you’re truly dealing. 2. What the IRS/CRA want is for you to create a controversy. They make this ‘amount owing’ so ‘off the charts’ that you will either telephone or write to them about this ‘outrage’ thereby creating a contract with them. This is all they need to enforce their nonsense. I do not contract with thugs. They are worse than loan sharks. If you argue, then you have created a controversy and the entire issue can go to court in order to be adjudicated. If you accept their offer, where is the controversy? What is there to judge? The only reason any matter ever goes to court is because the officers of the court know that at some point you will unwittingly grant them jurisdiction over you. Until you do this, they cannot hold you - no matter what you think you might have done. Call it luck, but one day I got a (signed) letter from some hotshot at the IRS stating that my account is ‘paid in full’ and apologizing for any inconvenience. The only explanation I can think of is that I never testified, argued, or contracted further with them; I only asked questions. You might have read recently about the pilot who won against the IRS in Federal ‘court’. She won because she had documented that she had continually asked the IRS to provide the law compelling her to pay tax on her income and they had failed to respond. Her affidavits proved they had defaulted so the judge ruled in her favour. 3. Each agent is vicious because he stands to receive personally a percentage of the funds he recovers from you. Don’t fall for his intimidation. Know that he is as frightened for his job as you might be about losing your $$$. 4. About 15 years ago, a man received from the IRS, a letter saying they intended to audit him. He 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"was very frightened and intimidated. An IRS agent came to his house since this is where he claimed to have his office. I told him he was not required by law to let her into his house and he ought to demand by what authority she intended to investigate his business. He said, “If I’m co-operative and courteous, she will be reasonable.” His allowing her into his house was deemed his acquiescence thereby granting her jurisdiction. He thought it would end quickly yet it only allowed IRS to know they had another sucker who fell for their bluff. The IRS hounded him for another dozen years until they levied his bank account and confiscated his ‘pay cheques’ from his customers. Don’t keep your cash in a bank account. To this day, no one has ever stolen my $$$ from either my pocket or my house yet banksters have twice stolen my $$$ from my bank accounts. Realizing they would put him out of business he left the country. It was his fear which gave the IRS this incredible control over his life. Had he turned around and looked at the monster chasing him in his dream, he would have seen that it was not what he thought. The nonsense ended only after I wrote the IRS a cheque (on the private side of my closed bank account) for $284,000. (more later) The son of a fellow I know was fleeced by the IRS who confiscated from his bank account $11,000. He wrote them a letter which included five (5) questions. The IRS agent invited him to his office in order to answer his questions. At the time of the meeting the IRS agent returned to his account the $11,000. You might want to know what the five questions were. He asked for answers to the following to be made under penalty of perjury: the law requiring Americans to pay income tax, their regulatory authority and delegated authority to address him, the law which made the IRS part of the Constitution, the agent’s oath of office, and the contract with both signatures on it. Since NONE of these exists, his $11,000 was refunded. Since an oath of office by any ‘public official’ is their swearing to uphold our rights, we accept their oath of office into the matter at hand and they are bound to honour their oaths and stop attacking us. We are not bound to respond to anyone who has no oath of office. This Oath of Office limits those who are in the biz of confiscating our rights and freedoms. Always ask for it and if you don’t get one be sure to issue your own orders to them on what you want them to do. Remember who you are. One of my most memorable experiences was when I asked an IRS agent, in person, to show me in the Internal Revenue Manual, which is over 7,000 pages and about 5 inches thick - all of it bogus - where it is written that I must pay a tax on my income. He pointed to the book and said, “In there.” “I believe that you think it is ‘in there’; show me where.” This time he pounded the book and then fluttered the pages and again, this time more forcefully said, “In the manual!” “I see ... where exactly?” Now he got even more violent with his beloved manual at which point my friend and I burst out laughing and just left him spluttering in his office. Don’t take these twits too seriously. Call their bluff. CRA sent me a Notice of Assessment wherein they told me they had over-paid me and I was to return some $$$. This was due to their having confiscated funds from my ‘paycheque’, without my permission, when I worked as an RN. I sent them a Bond to discharge their debt and settle and close the account. Sure, I received a few subsequent letters from unknown entities. Since I had sent my Bond to Alan Nymark, the commissioner, I wasn’t about to correspond with anyone but him. He didn’t seem to have any complaint about my bond. I returned all the CRA correspondence, ‘acceptance denied for cause without dishonour’, since their letters were immaterial. I haven’t heard from them in months. If indeed I really ‘owed’ them something, my experience has taught me that they would confiscate, with impunity, the entire contents of my bank account. They did not. There was nothing wrong with my bond. We cannot pay for anything; there is nothing with which to pay . One day I was on my motorcycle with my 7-year-old son on the back. I again heard my intuition, “Put down both feet at STOP sign.” I laughed; any motorcyclist knows that we keep one foot on the brake. However, a few blocks later, I was stopped by a cop. When I asked why he stopped me he said that I hadn’t stopped at the STOP sign. I responded (this was before I learned never to testify or argue the facts) that indeed I had stopped. He said, “You didn’t put down both feet at the STOP sign.” I was stunned! I had been told precisely what to do by some entity who could foresee what was about to occur and cared enough to warn me - verbatim . I was shaken that I had not trusted my intuition since the subsequent ramifications became a bureaucratic nightmare. I became aware of many other times I had intended to warn myself about one thing or another and had ignored my intuition. Clearly my lesson in life was to trust myself - to BE my own authority. I had blatantly failed to behave according to what I knew to be true. I vowed always to listen to only me. About 7 years ago, I received one of those, “Here’s $3,500 (USD) for a Happy Christmas .... just sign the back of this check”,where it outlined how much I would pay over whatever period of time I took to repay this alleged loan if indeed I cashed the cheque. I loved it. I mozied over to my bank, endorsed the cheque and was handed $3,500 FRNs. They were right; I did have a happy Christmas that year. When they 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"sent me a statement about a month later, trying to collect something from me which not only didn’t exist but also didn’t cost them anything other than postage and printing, I requested proof of their loss. They were flummoxed. They didn’t lend me anything. Understand that banks do not ‘qualify’ you in order not to lose $$$, they ‘qualify’ you in order to gain $$$; they don’t want to lend to educated customers. They can’t lose anything they never lent. I hear where your ego just took you ... ‘well, you got something for nothing’. No, I didn’t; I sold my signature for $3,500 - a good price back in 1997. All I got was $3,500 in worthless FRNs. Since then, I’ve done the math. My signature is now worth 15 billion dollars (CAD). Then they got really jumpy and sent me threatening letters. I asked that they show me their loss. What loss could they possibly have sustained? Is my bank out any $$$? No, its books are balanced since they were electronically credited by the ‘other’ bank (there’s only one bank). Is the other bank out any $$$? No, the returned cheque with my signature was their credit. So their books were balanced. Were my books balanced? Of course! My debit was my signature and my credit was the cash. It is all just bookkeeping entries. Who owes what to anyone? The transactions are complete. It was simply an exchange of debit/ credit. Why would I give them anything more than what I already gave them - my signature, which is by the way, by far more valuable than $3,500 because they will lend funds against my signature many times, earning them, depending upon the rate of interest, at least 9 times that amount. This is called ‘fractional banking’ and their not apprising me of this is called ‘bank fraud’. So in fact I did them a huge favour by selling them my signature. They informed me that I had not ‘repaid my loan’. This is called ‘double billing’. ‘Double billing’ is fraudulent. Have you ever gone crazy when a corporation spends 50¢ on a stamp to send you a bill for 11¢ ? You wonder what they’re smoking to make such a fiscally inane blunder and yet, this is fabulous evidence for the fact that it has nothing to do with $$$, rather the balancing of their books. Their billing you is simply ‘a cost of doing business’, in particular, to be certain that the credits balance the debits on their ledger. The ‘money’ the banks issue is merely bookkeeping entries. It costs them nothing and is not backed by their wealth, efforts, property, or risk. From 1913 until 1933 the U.S. paid ‘interest’ with more and more gold. The structured inevitability soon transpired - the Treasury of the United States’ government was empty, the debt was greater than ever, and the U.S. was forced into involuntary bankruptcy. This means that the Crown laid claim to everything. In exchange for using notes belonging to bankers who create them out of nothing , based on our credit, we are forced to repay in substance - our labor, property, land, productivity, businesses, and resources - in ever-increasing amounts. At that time I did not know what I know today and so they did put a smudge upon my credit record yet it was worth it because at that point, with a black mark anyway, I figured that I might just as well ring up all the credit cards and ask the same question. The upshot was that I lived about 3 years without credit but since I came away with about $50,000 USD worth of credit along with the education on how not to re-pay more than double for something I never received, it was well worth it. Meanwhile, the process has improved and I intend there to be only temporary black smudges on my credit record. I’m still working on this. My signature is worth whatever I say it is at any given instance. I signed for $10,000 credit with MBNA Bank. They sold my signature for who knows how much. After I used all the credit I had created, I discharged their debt. Yes, their debt; I allowed them to use my credit, via my signature, and they created the debt in order to balance their books. Now they wanted me to send them over $11,000. I asked them to send me a copy of the contract between ‘MARY’ (the name in upper case letters) and MBNA. I guess they couldn’t find it ... maybe because it never existed. I also asked them for validation of the debt (record of their accounting) and verification of their claim against me, since what I am called (Mary) was nowhere on the alleged contract. They began to telephone asking me to send them $$$ yet never put anything in writing. What does this tell you? They had no valid claim. I told them I was very willing to pay any obligation I might owe, if they could provide proof of their claim. They could not. They were incapable of substantiating their claim. I never received anything from them suggesting that the manner in which I had paid them was insufficient, unacceptable, improper, or failed to discharge the debt. Besides, I did pay them; in fact I paid them more than double. They had my original signature and I also sent them another signature attached to the final amount they claimed I owed them, not to mention a few hundred I sent while I was busy ringing up the card, so they made a killing off me. If they had a legal leg to stand upon they most certainly would have written to me, not to mention sent their ‘legal counsel’ after me, which they did threaten, by the way, but only over the telephone, never on paper. Idle verbal threats have no lawful clout. I never stiffed anyone. The ‘contract’ they believe I had with them was invalid because there was no full disclosure - one of the requirements of a valid contract. It was not spelt out to me that they were in the business of perpetrating fraud upon unsuspecting people. Since most people are willing to have their funds 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"fraudulently confiscated, they generally leave people like me alone. They don’t want to let the cat out of the bag. It would mean the demise of their racket, not to mention the entire economic system. But isn’t this what we want? It isn’t working for us - 99% of the world’s population; its only working for them - 1%. About a year later MBNA did in fact file suit against the entity listed on the credit card account. Even according to Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, MBNA are thugs and they advise ‘consumers’ to avoid them. MBNA is particularly vicious and the reason is because they have their own legal team. They don’t sell their accounts to third party collection agents, as most credit card banks do. Collection agents have no standing in law because they are interlopers and never contracted with the entity they claim owes them; hence they are powerless to collect on ‘deficiencies’. Rather than produce for MBNA my plethora of documents evidencing that they were in dishonour, as they failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, that I had accepted their offer and returned it thereby vitiating any controversy requiring adjudication, I just settled and closed the accounting. First, I apprised the Minister of Finance that I would be authorizing MBNA to use my exemption via a Pre-Authorized Transfer and unless he could rebut my position with relevant, specific, lawful authority and how it applies to me, I’d go ahead and send MBNA a transfer instrument, which I did. I made sure that I created a contract with my terms and conditions between MBNA and me. After I sent a Notice of Agreement, a Statement of Account showing the balance as zero, and a Confirmation of Agreement that the accounting was settled and closed, I never heard from them again. I figure $14,000 from my $15,000,000,000.00 isn’t going to hurt me. A major law firm in Toronto threatened to sue me, on behalf of their client, CIBC, for about $11,000. We exchanged a few letters and finally I wrote, “I am not a corporation or a government-created fiction; I do not give you permission to make a legal determination about me or the entity you are accosting; you have failed to provide evidence of a contract between MARY and LAW FIRM, also evidence of your consideration, and you have failed to sign your offer of contract under penalty of perjury. Said failure constitutes your agreement that you are a third party interloper, you have no legal standing, no first-hand knowledge of the matter, and your claim is fraudulent.” I never heard from them again. I knew that I had succeeded when I got a call from a collection agent claiming to be collecting for CIBC. I could hardly contain my glee. This confirmed that the law firm had told CIBC that they could not sue me and so, in frustration, CIBC simply sold the account - again - to yet another collection agent that also threatened to sue me. I told him I look forward to it. You know I was dying to ask him, “If a major law firm in Toronto failed in its attempts to sue me what makes you think you will succeed?” I had no idea that speeding fines in BC are so extortive, yet, I actually like the idea since, the grander the charges for which I can stiff them, the happier I feel. My friend got a ticket for $358 for over 30 km. over the speed limit. Apparently, the fine for over 30 km. is automatically over $300. I just had her write across the ticket, “I reject your offer of contract”, complete an affidavit, and tell them she wants an affidavit made under penalty of perjury to accompany their offer of contract. That was the end of that. I ought to mention that since implementing any of the above-listed successful remedies, I have been even more successful with easier, faster, more succinct remedies which I would outline here for you yet we continually improve them. Is anyone tired of the GST or just sales tax in general? I drew myself up a “GST, Sales, Excise, and Use Tax Exemption Certificate”. No one is required to pay any tax on anything yet I use it just for big ticket items and gasoline. Gas tax alone is 37% of the gas bill. Or you can just let the feds know that you know there is no requirement for GST/ sales or any other tax and Notice them that since the taxes were paid ‘in error’ you are due a refund of the amount evidenced on the enclosed receipts. My suggestion for those in biz who are collecting GST for the feds and not being compensated for their time and labour is to enclose an invoice for your fee of maybe 90% for doing their dirty work for them, deduct that from what you have collected, and enclose a cheque for the remainder. Better idea is to quit charging your cusomers a tax they are not required to pay. I am still dealing with collection agents and credit card banks but I have way more fun with them now. I ask the credit card companies to send me a bill, not a statement, to include a copy of the contract, evidence their consideration (what they gave me, which was nothing, in exchange for the $$$ they want), and have it signed under the full, commercial liability of one who can bind their corporation in contract. Since they can’t do this and it would be fraud if they did, they pass it along to collection agents who are even more fun because, who are they? I never had any contract with them either. They are all third party interlopers/ debt collectors. I just tell them to get out of my commercial affairs. I like best the ones who have the attorneys write the letters because .... the bigger they are, the harder they fall. My latest ploy is I just pay them with a transfer instrument - makes them crazy. The economics of banking is counterfeiting. We have been deceived into thinking that we were lent 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"other depositor’s deposited funds. Banksters cause us to think that if we do not pay back those funds, the bank and its depositors will be out the cash. Remember, all you borrowed was monetized credit, which your signature created. You lent yourself the funds. Why are you paying back anyone? Ask a banker about this, as I did, and watch him stop breathing. If a counterfeiter counterfeits $$$ and lends it to us, do we have any moral or legal obligation to repay the loan? NO ! The law (statute) says counterfeiting is illegal and that we do not have to repay the counterfeiter. But the banksters are careful. The bank’s own published manual claims, “Money does not have to be issued by the government or be in any special form. Money is anything that can be sold for cash and which the banks accept as money”. Aren’t they a riot? The story about Dan Mahowney who allegedly defrauded the bank out of several million $$$ and also the story about Frank Abegnale in his book Catch Me If You Can never took anyone else’s cash. Dan and Frank signed for every note they received. They created the funds themselves. No one lost any $$$, neither the investors in Mahowney’s case nor Pan Am employees in Abegnale’s case. I’ll bet to this day, both these men think that they did something illegal. Yet, not one living soul lost any $$$ to either of them. The corporate entities pretended theft and had them punished in order to preserve and perpetuate the scam. When you purchase something from a shop and then return it, why are they so intent on getting back your receipt? No, not to prove you paid for it, because you can’t pay for anything. This receipt is the evidence of exchange. The goods don’t matter, any more than the principle on a ‘loan’ matters. All they want is the interest. Look at your minimum payment due on your credit card statement; its only the interest. The ‘loan’ doesn’t exist. They MUST pay the IMF the interest on the loan. A friend responded, “We don’t worry about money, if that’s what you’re asking.” I was glad to hear this but I know its only a matter of time. He and his wife are paying, via their labour, probably 4 times the price of their 5 bedroom house which translates into 30 years of paying for the cost of maybe 6 months labour plus the supplies it took to build. This disparate ratio seems never to be questioned. Whom are they paying? The banks. For what? Credit. Did they get anything for their labour? You might think they got their house for their labour yet they did not; they got their house for their signature on the promissory note. Their ‘labour’ is the confiscation of their lives. The actual process of money creation takes place primarily in banks ... bankers discovered that they could make loans merely by giving their promise to pay, or bank notes, to borrowers. In this way banks began to create money. Transaction deposits are the modern counterpart of bank notes. It was a small step from printing notes to making book entries crediting deposits of borrowers, which the borrowers in turn could ‘spend’ by writing checks, thereby ‘printing’ their own money. - Modern Money Mechanics , Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago I first became aware that all my suspicions about the banking system were accurate when I read Thoren’s book, Truth In Money . I learned that all money is ‘borrowed into existence’. It doesn’t exist until someone borrows it. It is ‘debt-based money’, hence it is not really money since real money is based upon substance - gold, silver, etc. If ‘money’ is borrowed into existence, then this is all that exists. So, where is the ‘interest’? It doesn’t exist. How can it possibly be paid? It can’t be paid because it is not part of what is created. It simply does not exist. The currency we use is based upon our future labour which the Feds have promised to the banksters. It also does not yet exist. Future generations are already enslaved to pay a debt which does not exist. We can’t pay debt with something of no substance. We also need to take a look at how the account statements were created. Goods and services are assigned a value; everything is only true because someone says so and someone else agrees to it. Do you ever question your bills, which are not true bills in commerce but rather ‘statements of account’? ... not the ‘amount due’, but the concept . What if you found out that everything you ever needed or wanted was already paid for? - that you didn’t ‘owe’ anyone anything? When you go into a store to buy a book and you pay in whatever manner you choose, what do you get for the payment? No, not the book; you get a receipt. The evidence for this is that the dollar amount on the receipt matches precisely the dollar amount on your payment. It is an exact exchange. The book is not even part of the equation. It was pre-paid; all you did was go to the store to claim and retrieve it. In order to understand the concept of ‘pre-paid’, imagine this: Suppose you want to open a restaurant and you just need another $10,000 and so you ask a friend to lend it to you. Knowing that there is no money and the currency your friend has is essentially worthless compared to what he truly wants in his life, he sure wouldn’t mind lending it to you. So after a couple of months you ashamedly go to him and say that there is no way you can ever pay him back, what with 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"interest and all, yet you are so ingratiated to him you tell him that he can eat in your restaurant any time he wants - for free. Not only that but also you would be so grateful if he would because, alas, it would assuage your guilt. All he is required to do when the waiter presents him with an itemization of his meal is to sign it; he is not required to pay for his meal - its ‘prepaid’. In the same way, our bills are already paid and in fact the corporate entity who is billing us would be only too grateful if we would take advantage of our having prepaid them because then they wouldn’t have to pay the tax on the $$$ we send them. So all that is required of us is to sign the invoice and return it to them. The telephone company is funded by the government; you and I, and everyone who has a birth certificate or socialist number have funded the government. So, we have an ‘exemption’ the same way your friend is exempted from paying for his meals at your restaurant. Why is the telephone company sending us a statement (not an invoice) with a ‘amount owing’ on it? We paid up front. All goods and services are now lawfully ours just for the asking. For a few years I have been traveling around in my ‘92 Cadillac, originally registered, licensed, and insured in New Mexico. I can’t tell you how many people have told me that I was supposed to have registered it in Alberta within 45 days of its being here. How is it that ‘everyone knows’ this? Well, that would have been four years ago, so I suppose by their standards, I’m slightly overdue. Since I know the difference between ‘registration’ and ‘recording’, I sent the Minister of Transport (I use the Ministers of the Canadian Government to work for me) a Proposal of Contract, the terms and conditions of which are that we agree that what I have put on my licence plate will identify my automobile as not one of theirs. It is mine. Also, I agree to carry with me a form of identification, which I created, in case there is an incident whereby they require to know who is involved. I enclosed a Surety Bond as security to settle any claim of liability in the event of an incident requiring compensation from another living soul. I sent a copy to the local gens d’armes. If I am asked about ‘proof of insurance’ I can honestly respond by providing evidence that I have posted a million $ Bond. The RCMP has been very accommodating whenever I have shown them my ‘International Driver Permit’ ... which came from my computer. I slapped onto it a pic of me taken by my son and ... voila. They pretend their interest is in the expiration date, however, I know they are really noticing that I have nothing which can be construed as their having jurisdiction over me. (more on this in the section on ‘Licensure’). If I’m ever stopped I have with me evidence of the tacit admission from the Minister himself that what I am doing is lawful. If it isn’t, he has tacitly agreed to be held culpable. Since I claimed the Cadillac on a UCC 3 Addendum to my Financing Statement (UCC 1) and also on a PPSA, I control the Caddy and I can evidence that none of the constabulary can legally confiscate it unless they compensate me for it. Over the date sticker on the plate I put, “NO EXP” (No Expiry) A fun thing to do if you are ever stopped by the cops, in response to, “Can I see your driver’s licence, please?” is “Why would I want one of those?” There is no answer because what legal lunatic would carry around the very thing which gets him into trouble. I think you’re safer with a 38 special on the passenger seat; at least it is not concealed. Imagine when everyone begins to do what I and many others have done, the PTB will cease to function. The only thing keeping everyone from doing what I do is fear, which is caused from lack of information, time, and clarity on the concept. I intend to change this for you so that you can begin to ‘live your life’, doing what you want instead of ‘earning your living’. Too many people are working way too hard to pay for: 1. things that are already theirs because they are pre-paid and all that is required is for them to claim them; and 2. charges which they are not required to pay because they are not liable for them in the first place. Since I caught on to how to make contracts work for me, my best example being the confirmation of agreement to the terms and conditions of the contract I have with the Minister of Transport Canada, I decided to have way more fun with this process. I wrote to the Minister of Justice Canada telling him I intended to grow, process, market, sell, transport, possess, and use cannabis, aka marijuana. After 30 days I sent him a confirmation of his agreement to the terms and conditions of our contract and if I ever opt to grow, sell, and smoke dope I’ll just notice the local RCMP so they know not to bother me. One of the terms of our contract is that if I get into any trouble he agrees to be culpable. Pursuing this adventure, I wrote to the Premier of the province and also the provincial Advisor for Procedure Policy for Municipal Affairs and asked them both about ‘property tax’. Neither could prove that I am required to pay property tax. The way to stop paying any tax, never mind property tax, is to remember you are a sovereign and begin to behave like one. I intend to show the contract I have with them to those 18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"who have what I require. I’ll show people, my dentist comes to mind, how to save thousands per year in property tax and I’ll negotiate with them for whatever I need. Property taxes where I live are $5,000 a year. I also sent a proposal of contract to Messieurs Nymark and McCallum (CRA Commissioner and Minister of National Revenue) along with my Tax Exemption Certificate, begging them to prove where I owe income tax. Time’s up. They have tacitly agreed that no one is liable for any tax, not income tax or any of the interminable list of other taxes, service fees, penalties, fines, etc. which keep people working at jobs they don’t like and from families they generally do. I estimated that the time I put into writing letters to credit card banks, along with putting up with their annoying calls, etc. works out to no more than 40 hours per creditor. Since the cash I receive from said credit is about $10,000, I realized that this is far more income per hour than I ever earned from the Medical Mafia. I admit it is inconsistent but certainly more fun. The law suit filed by MBNA was one of the highlights of my life. I love this stuff. Knowing that the Toronto law firm which represented CIBC was forced to drop their intended suit due to my letter which let them know that I know ‘who I am’ was even better. A few years ago I wanted to travel to Oregon. I always get nervous crossing the border, for no reason other than Border Patrol, like cops, have no sense of personal power so they obtain jobs which make them appear powerful; hence, their insecurity can be annoying. I hadn’t yet purchased a flight and so the cost had escalated by the day. By the time I got to the airport the price of the ticket was over $900 USD. I wrote a cheque on a closed US bank account and my relief that it was accepted assuaged my usual angst over crossing the border. To this day I wonder if the asset funds from my ‘closed cheque’ were ever credited to United Airlines or did I play a small role in their declaring bankruptcy only a few months later. For those of you who think I stiffed the airline, think again. The cheque was written on the private side of the account - the closed side - which is not to be confused with the public side which is where the cash comes in. Remember the ticket was ‘pre-paid’ and so the private cheque simply accessed my exemption. The airline wasn’t out anything. Their account was credited, not with cash but with credit via EFT - electronic funds transfer. The benefit of this is that the airline didn’t have to pay tax on that income since it did not receive ‘fiat money’ which is why we are required to pay tax on it - it is not real substance, it is a fabrication of the bankster’s mind and they want a fee from us for using it. Since I used real asset funds, there was no tax for the airline to pay. They loved me for it. On that flight I picked up one of those classy magazines which sell everything anyone could never need and for Christmas I ordered a bunch of high ticket items. I sent a ‘closed cheque’ written against a US bank account, had the goods sent to a friend in New Mexico and she forwarded it to me. (the company wouldn’t accept a check for delivery outside the USA). All worked out well except that my friend had sent the goods via Fed Ex which then sent me a bill for $75.00 USD. So, I accepted for value their offer and returned it for settlement and closure of the accounting. A month later I received not only another bill but also the ‘Summary Sheet’ detailing their ‘claim’. I wrote to them asking what they did with my payment. A month later I received another letter which I didn’t open immediately. The following day I received a letter from a collection agent claiming they are collecting for Fed Ex which prompted me to open the Fed Ex letter. It was an apology for any inconvenience they might have caused me and that the bill was ‘Paid In Full’. I telephoned the collection agent and suggested they contact Fed Ex whose most recent letter states the account has been paid. End of story. Have you ever taken a cheque to the bank on which a cheque was drawn and been told by the bankster that if you don’t have an account with the bank she will charge you a fee? The bankster is intending to convince you that she is doing you a favour by cashing the cheque for you. Nothing could be further from the truth. The bank is acting as fiduciary to its customer who wrote you the cheque and who also pays the bank a monthly service fee to do so. The drawer is the debtor who owes you, the creditor. He is obliged to come to your house and pay you cash. Since this is inconvenient for him he writes you a cheque and hires the bankster to save him the time and trouble. You shouldn’t even have to go to the bank; the bankster should drop by your house with the cash; and yet she has the audacity to charge you even though you made the trip. This is a business matter between fiduciary and client and you are not a party to it. Yet, the bankster will do anything to extort funds from you if she can con you into thinking that she is performing a service for you. She is not; she is doing what she was hired, by the bank’s client, to do. Don’t fall for it. If she insists on charging you have her call her client to tell him that he has to come to the bank and cash the cheque himself and hand you the cash. My guess is the client will tell the bankster that he wants to speak to the manager to whom he’ll say, “I hired you to cash cheques for me. What am I paying you for?” *** 19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"PART II HOW IT HAPPENED The Bankers Opt to Rule the World There is afoot, a brilliant, albeit treacherous, scheme to control ALL the people and ALL the property of ALL the world. I wish I’d thought of it. I did suspect it at a very young age but of course had no reason to think I was so intuitive and accurate. Over the past 45 years, my suspicions have been corroborated, evidenced, and in fact played out. One could say that I anticipated it and hence it became my reality, and I shall expound upon this later, yet right now I intend to tell what is going on in order for you to have the option of changing your mind about how you manage your commercial affairs. World domination via confiscation of your $$$ is already on tap. England and the Rothschilds control the $$$ of every country of the world and therefore its laws. Two hundred years ago, Governor Cornwallis said, “The US will bring in the New World Order and its seat will be England.” It may appear that what goes on is happenstance, but the gov’t most surely has planned it. - FDR FDR was giving us a ‘heads up’ on what is really going on. His head, along with that of every other world leader, was/ is at the end of a gun. They are doing as they are told by the Zionist Illuminati Masonic conspiracy/ Powers That Be (hereinafter PTB). What happened is all documented and if you investigate you can find a plethora of information along with case law, codes, rules, regulations, statutes, legislation, etc. to support my contentions. So as not to bog you down, I shall quote the sources of only the most significant. Bretton Woods Agreement - 1944 This was the birth of the International Monetary Fund and from there all the foreign agencies - CIA, FBI, IRS, BAR - control everything via the 14th Amendment citizen - those who contract to become US citizens as opposed to remaining sovereign Americans. The sole creation of these agencies was for the purpose of collecting the debt. The US is a corporation owned by England - the Crown - the Vatican. The 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the USA was in order to enslave those who contracted with the state, thereby giving up their natural-born freedoms in exchange for so-called benefits. Every ‘benefit’ you believe you receive from the state, whether US or Canada, is at a cost, huger than you could ever imagine - unless you can keep it all separate as I have done. By contracting with thugs we hand over jurisdiction to them and no longer have any claim to rights. Fortunately, it is easy to take back our rights by revoking, rescinding, and canceling anything upon which we have written our ‘name’, ‘date of birth’, ‘socialist number (SSN/SIN)’, and ‘signature’ which might have been construed by the state/ banksters as a contract. Even having our post delivered to our house is considered a ‘government benefit’. I used General Delivery for a period of four (4) months after which time they intended to charge me. I discharged the charge yet it didn’t work because I had requested this service. This creates a conundrum because I was forced to request it since I didn’t want my mail delivered to my house; it is my personal policy not to reveal, to those who would confiscate my rights and my labour, where I sleep at night. All this stopped bothering me when I realized I can not be sued and no constabulary will dare to come to my house as I have confirmations of agreements with several Canadian Ministers who ensure my rights and hence, my safety. By the way, Elizabeth, of the family of Windsor (who changed the name to sound British instead of the German royalty she is, but let’s not go there now) is not the Monarchy of Canada. HER MAJESTY QUEEN ELIZABETH II is a corporation just like any other fiction. It is unfortunate, not to mention treasonous, that all our politicians have sworn an oath to this foreign entity. Equally absurd is that Elizabeth, in her Coronation, swore to uphold the Laws of God. What laws might those have been? I’d like to hear her list them. There is none. Politicians’ oaths of allegiance to ‘the Queen’ are fraud and high treason. Back to the gruesome story: All those industrialists, those bankers, whose names you’ve heard a million times, Rockefellers, Rothschild, Morgan, etc. decided that owing the world would be a fun game since, they probably had done everything else they ever wanted to do and were now bored. They devised a scheme to control the world. Wouldn’t we all do this if we had the brains and the means? Well, they had and they did. It was a simple case of bribing US politicians to overthrow their own money-creating system. Congress was the creator of money and somehow congress was ‘talked into’(read ‘bribed’)handing this responsibility over to a private corporation owned and operated by these banksters. Not to make them wrong - I might have done this too if I’d thought of it - but they literally destroyed the united Sates of 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"America and every country which fell like dominoes thereafter once the corporation called USA was founded. The Illuminati bankers rule the world through debt, which is money they create out of nothing. They need world government to ensure no country defaults or tries to overthrow them. As long as private bankers, instead of governments, create money the human race is doomed. These bankers and their allies have bought everything and everyone. - Henry Makow I want either less corruption or more chance to participate in it. - Ashleigh Brilliant Registration vs. Recording “Registration” comes from Latin “rex, regis” etc. meaning regal. So think about what occurs to whatever you ‘register’ - you hand legal title over to the Crown. When you register anything with the public, it releases legal title to the government corporation and leaves you with only equitable title - the right to use, not own, and for that use you will pay a ‘use’ tax which is every tax, be it income, sin, sales, property, etc. as opposed to lawful taxes, excise and impost. So that it doesn’t appear that the government now owns the property which you have registered they put it in a name which so much resembles your own that you won’t suspect it, however, the NAME is owned by the government. If you choose rather to record your legal title to your property with the public, you maintain your status as Title Owner. This is one of the most important things you can ever learn for the sake of your commercial affairs. The best example of the effects of registration is the birth certificate. A bankrupt entity - city, state/ province, country - cannot operate in commerce. So how do they manage? Since USA/CA have been bankrupt for decades, having no substance such as gold and silver to back it, the only asset it has are men and women and our labour. We are the collateral for the interest on the loan of the World Bank. Each of us is registered, via the application for a birth certificate. The Treasury issues a bond on the birth certificate and the bond is sold at a securities exchange and bought by the FRB/BoC, which then uses it as collateral to issue bank notes. The bond is held in trust for the Feds at the Depository Trust Corporation. We are the surety on said bonds. Our labour/energy is then payable at some future date. Hence we become the ‘transmitting utility’ for the transmission of energy. The USG/CAG, in order to provide necessary goods and services, created a commercial bond (promissory note), by pledging the property, labour, life and body of its citizens, as payment for the debt (bankruptcy). This commercial bond made chattel (property) out of us all. We became nothing more than ‘human resources’ and collateral for the debt. This was without our knowledge and/or our consent, via the filing (registration) of our birth certificates. When mums apply for a birth certificate, the application is registered. The legal title of her baby is then transferred from mum to the State. Mum is left with equitable title of her baby whom she can use for a fee - a ‘use tax’ - and since the property does not belong to her, she has to treat it in the manner which the owner wants. Colonel Edward Mandell House is attributed with giving a very detailed outline of the plans to be implemented to enslave the American people. He stated, in a private meeting with Woodrow Wilson (President 1913 - 1921), Very soon, every American will be required to register their biological property (that's you and your children) in a national system designed to keep track of the people and that will operate under the ancient system of pledging. By such methodology, we can compel people to submit to our agenda, which will affect our security as a charge back for our fiat paper currency. Every American will be forced to register or suffer being able to work and earn a living. They will be our chattels (property) and we will hold the security interest over them forever, by operation of the law merchant under the scheme of secured transactions. Americans, by unknowingly or unwittingly delivering the bills of lading (Birth Certificate) to us will be rendered bankrupt and insolvent, secured by their pledges. They will be stripped of their rights and given a commercial value designed to make us a profit and they will be none the wiser, for not one man in a million could ever figure our plans and, if by accident one or two should figure it out, we have in our arsenal plausible deniability. After all, this is the only logical way to fund government, by floating liens and debts to the registrants in the form of benefits and privileges. This will inevitably reap us huge profits beyond our wildest expectations and leave every American a contributor to this fraud, which we will call “Social Insurance.” Without realizing it, every American will unknowingly be our servant, however begrudgingly. The people will become helpless and without any hope for their redemption and we will employ the high office (presidency) of our dummy corporation 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"(USA) to foment this plot against America. - Colonel Edward Mandell House This is why I coach those who intend to ‘marry’ not to sign anything. Centuries ago, a man put a ring on a woman’s finger and declared, “With this ring, I thee wed”. Family members were the witnesses and that was it. There was no state-issued licence to sign ... frightful! Children can be taken from their parents because of the marriage licence. Do not invite into your private contract a third party which happens to be public, cares not about the interests of the other two parties, and has every legal right to force them to acquiesce to its demands. Your marriage ceases to be your own; the third party will tell you if and when you can end the marriage; the third party will dictate that your children will: 1. require a birth certificate and SSN/SIN 2. require a gov’t-directed (AMA/CMA) doctor to attend to his health, 3. be vaccinated by mandate, 4. attend the Public Fool System, 5. be prescribed and drugged by Ritalin, 6. sign up with the armed forces, etc. Your child will be a ‘ward of the state’ and the state will have prior say in what IT thinks is best for your child - you will not have jurisdiction over him. The birth certificate created a FICTION (the name of the baby in upper case letters). The state/ province sells the birth certificate to the Commerce Department of the corporations of USA/CA, which in turn places a bond on the birth certificate thereby making it a negotiable instrument, and placing the fiction, called a STRAWMAN, into the warehouse of the corporations of USA/CA. Representation for the created fiction was given to the BAR (British Accredited Registry/Regency), owned and operated by the Crown, for the purpose of contracting the fiction (which most of us think is ourselves) into a third party action. Do not underestimate the power behind this trick. It is to con us into contracting with the feds so that they can ‘legally’ confiscate our property. All these contracts have only our signatures on them because corporate fictions cannot contract (only natural beings have the right to contract - and the right not to contract). Because there is no full disclosure - we are never told that we have just signed away what we believe to be our property - these contracts are fraudulent, and hence, we are still the lawful owner and the profit earned by the feds from selling securities (our property) belongs to us and must go into a fund for our benefit, otherwise it would be fraud. Not wanting to be charged with fraud, the feds had to create a remedy for us ... and hope we wouldn’t discover it. For decades, through its ‘public’ school system, the government has managed to deceive us about some very important facts. All facets of the media (print, radio, television) have an ever-increasing influence in our lives and are controlled by government and its agencies, via the issuance of licences. We have slowly and systematically been led to believe that any form of our names represents us, which is not so. History of the World All problems, depressions, wars, disasters, assassinations - ALL of them were planned, caused, instigated, and implemented by the International Banksters and their attempt to establish a central bank in every country in the world, which they have now done, thanks to corrupt politicians who have been bought and paid for. This is all you need to know about the history of the world. John Fitzgerald Kennedy, who issued silver certificates, and Abraham Lincoln, who issued treasury notes (greenbacks), were the only men who actively intended to stop them. Both were assassinated by the Banksters. Garfield and McKinley talked about stopping them. Both were assassinated by the Banksters. The Government should create, issue, and circulate all the currency and credits needed to satisfy the spending power of the Government and the buying power of consumers. By the adoption of these principles, the taxpayers will be saved immense sums of interest. Money will cease to be master and become the servant of humanity. - Abraham Lincoln The International Bankers were relentless in setting up central banks, which the uSA resisted for decades because their system was working - no debt money. They realized the phenomenal profit to be had by printing their own notes, threatening congress to accept this private banking system, then lending $$$ at extortive interest rates (e.g.: the graduated income tax - the second plank of the Communist Manifesto). 22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"They demanded that the interest on the money they lent the government was to be paid in gold, hence, when the gov’t ran out of gold (there is no gold in Fort Knox - it was handed over to the Bank of England for the interest on the loan), it had to find some form of asset to use as collateral for the loans which it claimed to continue to need. But for what? Not much revenue is required for the true federal functions, namely: a navy, international and interstate trade and commerce, and the general welfare of all. The rest is extortion. What could they use if there were no more gold? Ah! - The citizens themselves ... but ... we are a sovereign people. How can we be held as assets for a debt which wasn’t real? We can’t, at least not lawfully. We can however, be tricked into believing that we are responsible for the debt by transforming us into accommodation parties to a fictional entity (strawman) created by the government. In a circuitous and scathingly brilliant marketing scheme, we were led to believe that we were who we were not and that we must work to earn funds in order to pay a debt which not only is not one which we ourselves incurred but also is a DEBT WHICH INCREASES BY OUR VERY WORKING TO PAY IT. You are probably wondering how in God’s name this ever came about. It doesn’t really matter, yet, here it is in a nutshell from those who witnessed it. It is not what we learned in the Public Fool System. Capital must protect itself in every possible way, both by combination and legislation. Debts must be collected, mortgages foreclosed as rapidly as possible. When through the process of law the common people lose their homes, they will become more docile and more easily governed through the strong arm of government applied by a central power of wealth under leading financiers. These truths are well known among our principal men who are now engaged in forming an imperialism to govern the world. By dividing the voter through the political party system we can get them to expend their energies in fighting for questions of no importance. It is thus by discreet action we can secure for ourselves that which has been so well planned and so successfully accomplished. - 1924 US Banker’s Association Magazine When Rothschild said, Let me issue and control a nation’s money and I care not who writes its laws , it was the beginning of the modern era’s financial, political, social, commercial, and military strife and subversion. - perfecteconomy.com The financial system has been turned over to the Federal Reserve Board. That board administers a finance system by authority of a purely profiteering group. That system is private, conducted for the sole purpose of obtaining the greatest possible profits from the use of other people’s money. This (Federal Reserve) Act establishes the most gigantic trust on earth. When the president signs this bill, the invisible government by the monetary power will be legalized. The people may not know it immediately but the day of reckoning is only a few years removed, the worst legislative crime of the ages perpetrated by this banking bill. - Charles A. Lindbergh, R-MN We have in this country one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known. I refer to the Federal Reserve Board. This institution has impoverished the people of the United States and has practically bankrupted our government. It has done this through the corrupt practices of the money vultures who control it. A superstate controlled by international bankers and international industrialists acting together to enslave the world for their own pleasure. - Louis McFadden, D-PA Most Americans have no real understanding of the operation of the international money lenders. The accounts of the Federal Reserve system have never been audited. It operates outside the control of Congress and manipulates the credit of the United States. - Barry Goldwater, R-AZ I have unwittingly ruined my country. - W. Wilson, upon passage of Federal Reserve Act, 1913 If one understands that Socialism is not a “share the wealth” program but is in reality a method to consolidate and control the wealth, then the seeming paradox of super rich men promoting Socialism becomes no paradox at all. Instead it becomes logical, even the perfect tool of power-seeking megalomaniacs. Communism, or more accurately Socialism, is not a movement of the down-trodden masses but of the economic elite. - Gary Allen It (the Great Depression) was not accidental; it was a carefully contrived occurrence. The international Bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all. - Louis McFadden 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The Federal Reserve definitely caused the Great Depression by contracting the amount of currency in circulation by one third (1/3) from 1929 to 1933. - Milton Friedman There may be a recession in stock prices, but not anything in the nature of a crash. - Irving Fisher, leading U.S. economist, New York Times, Sept. 5, 1929 Practices of the unscrupulous money-changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion, rejected by the hearts and minds of men.

The central banks, through the IMF/World Bank have engulfed the world in a mathematically impossible debt-based debt/credit monetary system. Thirty-some-odd years ago, a high school student loosely formed a concept of mathematically perfected economy. In 1979 he published a mathematical proof that any economy conveyed by a currency subject to interest , ultimately terminates itself under insoluble debt. When Albert Einstein was asked what was the most fantastic thing he ever realized in all his studies, he responded, “ Compound interest. ” The Federal Reserve Bank is now in every country in the world - in Canada it is known as the Bank of Canada. The banksters are diabolical, unethical, ignoble, unconscionable, dishonourable, dastardly tyrants. Not to stoop to name-calling but it is exigent that you comprehend the insidiousness of their scheme and how it has destroyed every life to some degree or another. They have kept all of us in peonage and most of us in penury. I know not one single soul who is not obsessed to some degree with money or the lack thereof, or at least from the perspective that they are not obsessed. Our lives have become about ‘money and not money’, meaning we are never free of it - if only of the concept of it. So, the focus of everything we ever learned in history class was immaterial and irrelevant; the facts may be accurate but as you’ll see later, facts are immaterial; all that matters is honour/dishonour, contract, and credit/debit. We are entrenched in a game of commerce about which we have been kept in the dark for the purpose of our slavery. There may be a few centuries in the history of the world which were not about commerce, but certainly the past two millennia have been for the purpose of enslaving the masses for the profits and lifestyles of the global elite. It is nearly completely in place. I always suspected the banking system was fraudulent. It was simply a case of noticing the tallest, most lavish buildings in any city were bank buildings. One needn’t be particularly astute to see what’s happening. When I read Thoren’s book I was elated to discover I was accurate and yet disheartened to realize ... I was accurate. We are completely dependent on the commercial banks. Someone has to borrow every dollar we have in circulation, cash or credit. If the banks create ample synthetic money we are prosperous; if not, we starve. We are absolutely without a permanent money system. It is the most important subject intelligent persons can investigate and reflect upon. It is so important that our present civilization may collapse unless it becomes widely understood and the defects remedied very soon. - Robert H. Hamphill, Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank So, here is what we have today: A banking system controlled by a handful of private interests; the government with the ability to impoverish and terrorize productive people by controlling their take home pay and profits; a secret police bureau to track, harass, and occasionally murder dissenters while covering 24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"up the crimes of the elite; and a policy of social engineering in which the federal government actively forms public opinion. It is vitally important to understand how those in government turned our lives upside down and made us believe that we are subject under them; when in reality they are subject to us. Approximately the same thing occurred in Canada, only later, which means that when the US falls, Canada will be not far behind. 1865 - 13th Amendment - people could volunteer into slavery by accepting federal benefits. 1868 - The 14th Amendment created a new class of citizen, the ‘person’ subject to the Federal Gov’t. 1871 - the Federal Gov’t formed itself into a corporation - USA. I don’t know CANADA’s date of incorporation. 1913 - the Federal Reserve Central Banks were created. 1933 President Roosevelt put into effect the ‘Trading with the Enemies Act’. This applied only to Federal Citizens. 1933 - President Roosevelt took the gold away from the people, who were not lawfully required to relinquish it, and who then had no money with which to pay their debts. March 9, 1933 - ownership (legal title) of all property is in the State; individual ‘ownership’ is only equitable (user) title. Use must be in accordance with law and subordinate to the necessities of the State. (YIKES! Read that again.) 1933 - President Roosevelt passed HJR 192 June 5, 1933 - since the government had taken the gold, and the people had no money, the government would pay the ‘debts’ for the people, thereby giving them unlimited credit . Whoever has the gold pays the bills. This legislation states that one cannot demand from you a certain form of currency, since any form and all forms of currency are your credit . If they do, they are in breach of Public Policy, PL 73-10. Not only does this insurance policy protect the legislators from conviction for fraud and treason but also it protects the people from damages cause by the Feds. 1938 - Erie Railroad vs. Tompkins made contracts the rule in the courts. No other law prior to 1938 can be cited in cases. 1946 - government and court system was lost through the Administrative Procedures Act. 1965 - silver was removed as a means for paying debt, the Uniform Commercial Code became the supreme law of the land concerning the Banking System, the courts were pulled together in Admiralty/ Administrative and Civil (contract /commercial /corporate) Law, thereby removing the ‘innocent’ plea, thereby reversing ‘innocent until proven guilty’ to ‘guilty until proven innocent’. Securities replaced substance as collateral for debts; debt instruments with collateral, and accommodation parties could be used instead of money. The courts could uphold the security instruments which depended upon commercial fictions as a basis for compelling payment or performance. 1966 - The Federal Tax Lien Act: The entire taxing and monetary systems are hereby placed under the U.C.C. (Uniform Commercial Code) Since the declaration of bankruptcy, when our bodies and labour were pledged to pay for it, they stripped us of our title and rights and replaced these with privileges and benefits . We are now slaves/ chattel because we have unwittingly entered into adhesion contracts, albeit without full disclosure to the terms and conditions, thereby making them invalid and fraudulent, however, we are still bound to the terms until we undo the damage by rebutting the presumption. Statutes of Commerce - the UCC - replaced laws for natural beings with statutes for fictional entities. But we can not play a fictitious game; we need fictitious entities to play. So the gov’t created that game-token for us - the Strawman - and they tricked us by making the name of the Strawman appear to be the name that represents us. This is so we will think that it is we of whom they speak when they say words like ‘person’, ‘resident’, etc. except that we are not a ‘person’ or a ‘resident’. ‘person’ within the game applies to a fictional, non-existent, corporate, artificial, government-created entity, which has nothing to do with us other than the name they gave it seems as if it is the name we use to represent us. The entity to which the statutes refer and apply is always ‘person’ or ‘persons’. However, we know that this entity is a government-created fiction and does not exist. The feds/banksters have surreptitiously and carefully put the name of this corporate fiction into upper case letters to differentiate it from the real, flesh and blood living soul yet also to con us into believing it is we. This distinction is of paramount importance. Since we know that the corporation is the upper case name and that statutes apply only to corporations, and we know that statutes always use the word ‘person’ to describe to whom the statute applies, then we can conclude that ‘person’ is a corporation and not a living soul. We are not ‘persons’. Statutes do not apply to us. Only ‘laws’ apply to us; yet there is only one law so its easy for us to 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"remember: “we must not infringe upon the rights, life, liberty, or property of another living soul.” If we do, the living soul whom we have injured can file a witnessed, sworn complaint with the court and a jury will decide if that claim against us is legitimate and deal with us accordingly. What is going on in the ‘courts’ today is that the Strawman - the government-created corporation - is being charged with a crime based upon violation of a statute. This would be OK if we weren’t being held as surety for that entity which couldn’t possibly have done anything wrong because it exists only in the minds of those who would confiscate our freedom. We cannot be charged by the state with any crime because all crimes are commercial - and Commerce is an unreal situation in which we cannot involve ourselves because we are real. Fictions cannot connect with living souls; fictions cannot do anything which requires a meeting of the minds, eg: contract, or any of the senses of a living soul - hearing, seeing, thinking. Our use of the Strawman is to enable us to operate in Commerce. It is exigent that we learn how to do this so that we can begin to win by publicly ‘ discharging debt’ and privately , by ‘serving’. We were never meant to operate in commerce. We serve others best by serving ourselves . - Wm. Shakespeare The legal use of words is vastly different from normal English usage, the best example being when then-president Bill Clinton said, “That depends on what the definition of ‘is’ is.” We all laughed, yet Black’s Law Dictionary has eighteen (18) different meanings of the word ‘is’. Check every document which you think identifies you: birth certificate, driver licence, passport, voter registration, utility bills, etc. The name which represents you is nowhere on any of them. As fictitious entities cannot contract with natural beings, a transmitting utility is required for the connexion. The Strawman is the transmitting utility. So all contracts are between the Strawman and the Public entity, not between the Private living soul and a Public entity. Inasmuch as every government is an artificial person, an abstraction, and a creature of the mind only, a government can interface only with other artificial persons. The imaginary, having neither actuality nor substance, is foreclosed from creating and attaining parody with the tangible. The legal manifestations of this are that no government, as well as any law, agency, aspect, court, etc. can concern itself with anything other than corporate, artificial persons and the contracts between them. - Anonymous, in reference to US case: Penhallow vs. Doanes Administrators - 1795 Through the public fool system, the media, and other alleged ‘authorities’ in our lives we have been trained to believe that this Strawman name (a fictitious name identifiable by its being in upper case) is our name. It is not. The purpose of the Strawman name is to trick us into believing that we are the surety for any contract involving the Strawman. Since the feds created the Strawman, they control it and it is subject to its codes, rules, regulations, statutes, ordinances, and legislation. Private entities/sovereigns are not. If we are unaware of this we can be tricked into being held as surety for debts, liabilities, and obligations of the Strawman. If we ‘capture’ our Strawman by recording with the public its name via a Financing Statement - the one contract in the world which can’t be broken - (UCC-1 / PPSA - go to your Secretary of State website / ppsa.ca) in both our birth and domicile states/provinces we thereby claim it as our debtor. It is no longer subject to the feds; it is now under our control. We can also claim our birth certificate, which is the original title to the Strawman and so discharge and hence release us, the living souls, from any debt, liability, or obligation of the Strawman. All these debts exist only on paper, in a digital venue, in computers, in a fictional commercial world. They are not real, although the banksters would have us think so. Now, the property of the living soul is tax exempt and free from any levy. Accept for Value and Return for Discharge, Settlement, and Closure Fictional government can only function in a fictional commercial world - one where there is no real money, only fictional funds ... mere entries, figures, digits. All charges are a negative, commercial claim against the Strawman, not against us. Only the numbers move from one side of the account to the other - credit and debit. Our resisting these fictitious charges only gets us into trouble, so we accept them and discharge the charge, thereby balancing the account. Accepting the charge also removes the controversy, as I did with MBNA; there is then nothing to adjudicate so it can’t go to court. Accepting for Value the charge also allows us to remove the negative claim against the account thereby becoming the holder in due course of the charge/ presentment/ claim and can now request that the account be adjusted. As only we have the power to create credit, only we can balance the account. All debt is created on paper; therefore all debt can 26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"be discharged with ... other pieces of paper. Playing the Commerce Game as opposed to what most think is the Legal Game allows us to control the movement of figures, digits, and entries into the account for our benefit as opposed to the benefit of those who would confiscate our labour in the form of cash. Now, no statutes, codes, rules, regulations apply to us; they apply only to the Strawman of whom we now have control. So the feds have no jurisdiction over us, as they have not our consent, nor are we within their fictional, commercial venue. Those of us who opt to take charge of our commercial affairs become part of the solution instead of remaining part of the problem. In order to get one's liberty and independence back, one must first secure the title and ownership of the Strawman. Once one controls the straw man, then one controls the rights of the property that the Strawman acquires. For one to regain title to his body, the Birth Certificate must be secured. After we have redeemed it and filed public notice via a financing statement, then we have the right of property ownership through our Strawman whom we now control. The bond created and sold in the market place for the Strawman now becomes our property. Think of the board game Monopoly®™ where you pick up a ‘Chance’ card which reads, “Pay School Tax $150”, so you hand over the $$$ to the ‘banker’. (I think the Parker boys were trying to tell us something.) When the government charges the Strawman a tax we, the ostensible ‘players’, are held as ‘surety’ for our token/Strawman and ‘required to pay’ even though the charge is not directed towards us. It is directed towards our token (the top hat, race car, old shoe). We are paying for the token because our token isn’t real and so it can’t do anything. We are the energy for the token/ Strawman. Since the ‘money’ also is not real, there could be no real loss to us as natural beings except that this seems to be all there is. We used to be able to live real life with real money. Now we are playing a game with Monopoly money. We have been prevented from living real life; we are caught in a game. This did not come about by our conscious agreement. What if we want to go back to living real life? We’d have to get out of the game. This is tricky because the powers-that-be are capable of controlling us through confiscating our finances by keeping us in the game. Why would they allow us to opt out of a game which they are sure to win and which we are destined to lose? There is no way to stop playing the game unless we consciously do what it takes in order to extricate ourselves from the game. It is simple but not easy, mostly because the banksters refuse to lose. Also, most of us don’t realize we have a choice because most have never considered that we agreed to play a game we can’t win. Would anyone consciously choose to play such a game? The UCC is the rules of the game and any entity within that game is ‘corporate’, since no living soul can play this game, only Strawmen. Therefore, the Income Tax Act, being part of the Commerce Game, applies only to fictitious entities as they are the only entities who can play. Because the name of the game is confiscation of funds, they hold us, who want only to live life as freely as possible and ‘not infringe upon the rights of another’, as surety for our Strawman’s alleged debt. But Public Policy - in the US - HJR 192 of June 5, 1933, and in Canada, Order in Council April 10, 1933 - tells us that as there is no substance with which to ‘pay’ a debt, then all debt must be ‘discharged’. How can we ‘pay’ a debt when there is nothing with which to ‘pay’. We can’t; so all we can do is discharge it. Since there is no money, then the only thing left is credit, so we must ‘pay’ a debt with credit. How is credit created? VIA OUR SIGNATURE. Every time we sign our name to any promissory note, we have created credit. So, we must have a lot of credit. Are we using it? Or is some public entity using it? Every time we sign our name for any public purpose to any public entity, we are giving away our exemption. What are we getting in return? Example: If you go through a Stop sign, it is not you who is charged; it is your Strawman, because it is its name on this driver licence which you carry around and actually unwittingly use as ‘identification’. Also, any citation is directed to the Strawman; it does not have your name on it. However, since the Strawman doesn’t exist, it is you who is held as surety for the fine. Slick game, eh? I hear you saying, “but it was I who broke the law by going through the Stop sign.” What law? Remember, there is no law other than the one which protects the life, liberty, rights, and property of all living souls. So, you didn’t break any law, unless of course someone were injured, in which case I trust that, as an honourable soul, you would somehow make restitution. To this end I have posted a bond with the Minister of Transport in the event of an incident in which I might have to compensate another being. I will not pay a federally-owned corporation called an insurance agent to “protect” me. My uncle used to say, “Protect me from the Protectors.” The bond is backed by my exemption which is unlimited. Which is better? - slave-labouring to pay an insurance premium to an entity which might not cover your transgressions or might cancel your policy on a whim - or backing any commercial liability with your own unlimited exemption via a surety bond? I say the latter is safer. Soon we will again become ‘insurance’ for one another. When the farmer’s barn burned down his neighbours assisted him in rebuilding it, based upon their anticipation of needing assistance themselves 27"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"from neighbouring farmers - “good insurance”. The banksters infiltrated this workable plan by creating an insurance industry in the same manner they infiltrated the people’s trade by creating a debt-money system. “You now have to use our money/insurance companies instead of relying upon yourselves and your neighbours, but its going to cost you.” Who fell for this? Why would anyone put his trust into a fictional entity when he has trusted his neighbours for decades? I wouldn’t. Back to the traffic case. What actually occurred and for which you are being held for the charge against your Strawman is that you violated a statute. The statute applies only to fictitious entities and since a Strawman can’t do anything, never mind stop at a Stop sign, the cop (who might know this) will cause you to believe that it is you who made the transgression. But no statute applies to living souls, any more than ‘Go to jail; go directly to jail; do not pass GO; do NOT collect $200’ in Monopoly®™ applies to you ; it applies to the token race car. Too many of us are in fear. I notice that this fear translates into $$$. I’ve asked enough people of all ages if they could have what they want, they generally respond, “More money”. When people have what they believe to be a ‘problem’, they tend to want to fix the effect as opposed to the cause. They talk about getting a second job or getting another member of the family out to work, or borrowing $$$, in order to ‘make ends meet’. Did any of these frantic individuals ever sit down and ask, “ Why don’t we have any $$$ ?” If they did, the answer they came up with is the one with which we are programed every day, which is, “Can/Ams are spending way beyond their means and going into serious debt.” This is utterly FALSE . Most feel guilt and since they believe they themselves to be the cause of the problem, they do what they can to put a bandaid upon the effect instead of investigating the cause. NONE of what you have been led to believe about ‘national or personal debt’ is true. You have been conned by the masterminds of banking. I ask you again to keep in the back of your mind that this is ALL by design - a brilliant design to confiscate the property, land, cash, assets, and the ostensible intrinsic value of the people of the world - our labour - for the sole purpose of controlling us. ‘Loans’ A deposit created through lending is a debt that has to be paid on demand of the depositor, just the same as the debt arising from a customer's deposit of checks or currency in the bank. Of course they do not really pay out loans from the money they receive as deposits. If they did this, no additional money would be created. What they do when they make loans is to accept promissory notes in exchange for credits to the borrowers' transaction accounts. - Federal Reserve Bank, Chicago, Modern Money Mechanics, p. 6 When you entered into a loan contract with a bank, you signed a note or contract promising to pay back the bank, and you agreed to provide collateral which the bank could seize if you did not repay the loan. This contract supposedly qualified you to receive the bank’s money. The bank either sells or hypothecates our promissory note before we sign the final papers relative to the ‘loan’. In essence the bank is receiving the proceeds of the sale or hypothecation of our note before it purchases or accepts our note as a loan to itself . Banks are prohibited from lending their ‘own money’ from their own assets, or from other depositors. So from where did the $$$ come? The contract we signed (our promissory note) was converted into a ‘negotiable instrument’ by the bank and became an asset on the bank’s accounting books. According to the UCC 1-201(24) and 3-104, it was our signature on the note which made it $$$. Our promissory note (‘money’) was taken, recorded as an asset of the bank, and sold by the bank for cash ... without ‘equal valuable consideration’ given to us for our note. The bank gave us a deposit slip as a receipt for the money we gave them, just as the bank would normally provide when we make a deposit to the bank. It then created an account at the bank which would contain this $$$ which we just created. A check on this account was issued with our signature and this account is the source of funds behind the cheque which we received as a ‘loan’. The bank risked none of its own assets in the so-called ‘loan’ to us; rather it used our note to pay the seller, in order to raise an asset for itself, and also used the face value of our note as ‘principle’ which it claims it ‘lent’ us and against which it charged interest. Consideration on the part of the bank is non- existent so the bank has nothing to lose. It can not possibly sustain a loss. Since consideration is essential to an enforceable contract and the note was obtained from us via fraud, the entire transaction/ contract is fraudulent. In the Ashley case of 1988, fraud on the part of the bank was proven because the defendant revealed, 28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"“the banks told me they had ‘money’ to lend and they didn’t.” Mortgage contracts are written in such a way to appear as if the bank lent us funds before they received our promissory note/ mortgage contract so that the bank can use it as a receipt which they can sell. In fact, we signed and gave the mortgage contract/note to the bank prior to their giving us the funds. So, the application for the loan created the funds (it has our signature on it) and the note (with our signature) covered the funds to ‘repay’ the loan. Again, constructive fraud. My sons’ father obtained a ‘loan’ in 1972 in the amount of $46,000 USD to purchase a house. Since he continues to be the principal on the note and since the note continues to earn interest, including the fact that he ‘repaid’ the loan, his equity is now worth over $5,000,000 USD. We are, as I write, in the process of lending said equity back to the banks for a rental fee of 3% - 8% ... minimum $150,000.00 a year. If you continue to pay the bank that which it never lent you, you’ll now be paying me - maybe this will make you feel a bit better about it. Fraudulent National Debt Wars are major debt creators, which is what the banksters want - as much debt as possible - in order to collect more interest. In Canada, the income tax was implemented in 1917 as a temporary measure to pay for WW1. This is the true purpose of war and yet the people bought the ruse of either humanitarianism or worse, ‘making the world safe for democracy’, which is the most frightful system of government. All the players are manipulated by the banksters. They play both sides. The reason the banksters want democracy is because that is the only form of gov’t which they can manipulate and control under Law Merchants. Every democracy the world has known ends in an economic downward spiral. Don’t get me wrong about tyrannical dictatorships or archaic monarchies, however, when a regime is forced to change to a democracy it dies economically. Trust me, the PTB do not want democracy for our benefit; it is for theirs. Democracy is indispensable to Socialism . - V. I. Lenin Socialism leads to Communism. - Karl Marx Since we use debt notes to ‘purchase’, which denotes having only equitable title (‘buy’ denotes having legal title) then all we’re doing is passing along the debt and increasing the interest with each transaction. This is precisely the agenda of the banksters. This is the classic “the rich get richer and the poor get poorer”. It is they who get the taxes and it is we who get the worthless notes which we are trying to spend before they become completely devalued. Whenever anyone is offered the ‘package deal’, which is so common these days, thanks to lay-offs and downsizing, not to mention ‘outsourcing’, they ‘take the money and run’. Good strategy. Do not continue working; do not look back. Get out while you can and get doing something worth your time and energy. I suspect that when one is laid-off, it is not because the company can no longer afford to pay you your salary; it is because of their cost of your ‘benefits’. Remember that ‘benefits’ are already ours, because everything we could ever need or want is pre-paid, but we have been led to believe that said benefits are ‘privileges’, not rights, and therefore, we are slave-labouring for them. Our labour is off-set by our paycheque which we fund via our signature/exemption; yet it is the so-called ‘benefits’ which the corporations can no longer afford because it is a real cost to them. Why do you suppose the ‘package deal lay-offs’ are so attractive? It is because you are funding them via your exemption to which the corporation has access long after you are gone because they still have your SSN/SIN. If you are ever told you are being laid-off, try suggesting that you will work for “salary only, no benefits”. I don’t really think this will change their tune, only because you are a drop in the bucket, however, you might see their eyes go for a swim, presuming they are onto the scam, which, let’s face it, anyone who works in ‘Human Resources’ is not privy to this scam or they wouldn’t be wasting their days in HR - I like to think. The Federal Reserve Bank is privately owned by several private investors (Global Elitists). Their purpose is to manipulate financially the transfer of ostensibly ‘privately owned’ property back to themselves. Federal Reserve funds are not backed by any substance, yet, based upon bookkeeping entries, the currency can be moved thereby making the people slaves to this system. Their true income from this unlawful debt-money system is the interest from fictional loans. The surest way to overthrow an existing social order is to debauch the currency. - Lenin There are two methods, or means, and only two, whereby man's needs and desires can be satisfied. One is the production and exchange of wealth; this is the economic means. The other is the 29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"uncompensated appropriation of wealth produced by others; this is the political means. Albert Jay Nock In 1990, I read the Truth in Money Book by Theodore R. Thoren who claims that the national debt is an illusion because the interest on the debt created by this debt-money system under which we slave is unpayable; it simply accumulates endlessly. In order to force this system upon the people, the feds permitted the banksters to steal the gold of the people as payment of interest on the bankruptcy and make it illegal for the people to own gold. Howard Freeman said this about the gold standard: “We are now permitted to own gold again only because the intention is to force the Can/Am people onto a strict gold standard while we have no gold which will permit this system to operate even marginally. Forcing us onto a gold standard, under the guise of our ‘proven’ inability to manage debt, will complete the destruction of the middle class and finish our subjection to the International Bankers and the UN.” But sovereigns can never be in debt. We fix the price of gold and silver to make them valuable or not. - J.P. Morgan, in a letter to his son In the absence of the gold standard, there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation. There is no safe store of value. If there were, the government would have to make its holding illegal, as was done in the case of gold .... The financial policy of the welfare state requires that there be no way for the owners of wealth to protect themselves. This is the shabby secret of the welfare statists’ tirades against gold. Deficit spending is simply a scheme for the ‘hidden’ confiscation of wealth. Gold stands in the way of this insidious process. It stands as a protector of property rights. - Alan Greenspan, Gold and Economic Freedom Since all the (government-educated) financial advisors suggest buying gold in order to survive the coming depression, I suggest that if you think precious metals will save your life ... then buy silver. The banksters first bought all the politicians. Next they bought all the major media to promote the illusion that politicians represent our interests. Then they took control of the education system, ensuring kids stop thinking at an early age. The Office of Homeland Security is designed to control us in order to confiscate our funds for the purpose of paying the alleged debt of trillions of dollars. Its only a matter of time before we will have no more cash, no pensions, no government ‘benefits’. If we resist, there is an Orwellian police state and military police to ensure it. - author unknown The Media Give me control of the German media, and I can control the German people. - Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's propaganda minister In March, 1915, the J. P. Morgan interests, the steel, shipbuilding, and powder interest, and their subsidiary organizations, got together 12 men high up in the newspaper world and employed them to select the most influential newspapers in the United States and sufficient number of them to control generally the policy of the daily press ... They found it was necessary to purchase the control of only 25 of the greatest papers. An agreement was reached; the policy of the papers was bought, to be paid for by the month; an editor was furnished for each paper to properly supervise and edit information regarding the questions of preparedness, militarism, financial policies, and other things of national and international nature considered vital to the interests of the purchasers. - U.S. Congressman Oscar Callaway, 1917 We are grateful to The Washington Post, The New York Times, Time Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years. It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during those years. But, the world is now more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto-determination practiced in past centuries. - David Rockefeller, founder of, and in an address before, the Trilateral Commission, in June of 1991 Our job is to give people not what they want, but what we decide they ought to have. - Richard Salant, former President of CBS News 30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"The business of the journalist is to destroy the truth; to lie outright; to pervert; to vilify; to fawn at the feet of Mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread. You know it and I know it, so what folly is this toasting an independent press? We are the tools and vassals of rich men behind the scenes... They pull the strings... AND WE DANCE. - John Swinton, former chief-of-staff for the New York Times, in an address to fellow journalists. When you control opinion, as corporate America controls opinion in the United States by owning the media, you can make the [many] believe almost anything you want, and you can guide them. - Gore Vidal from The Golden Age The great mass of people ... will more easily fall victim to a big lie than to a small one. What luck for rulers that men do not think. - Adolf Hitler The man who never looks into a newspaper is better informed than he who reads them; inasmuch as he who knows nothing is nearer to the truth than he whose mind is filled with falsehoods and errors. It is a melancholy truth that a suppression of the press could not more completely deprive the nation of its benefits than is done by its abandoned prostitution to falsehood. - T Jefferson All media are negative, untruthful, and unreliable. Whatever information you get, about what is going on in the world, from TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, school, or the government, you can count on the opposite being the truth. They all ought to be required to file an affidavit stating: “Under full commercial liability, I claim the following to be true, correct, complete, and not misleading”. But why not just let the whore media be whores and just know that this is what they do? Media appeal to our ego minds; they align with our fears which motivate us. As long as we are aware of this, we can choose not to be influenced. Be aware that most of the media are controlled by just a few. Use discernment. Why is this information being presented to you? What is their real agenda? Is it a case of problem-reaction-solution? Do they create a problem so that we react and ask for the fix, then they offer their solution? The ‘solution’ is what they really wanted in the first place. About a year ago, my son apprised me that Michael Jackson was all over the news for the entire day. I asked him why he thought this was the only event on TV. I explained that there must be something going on in the world and that this was a red herring meant to draw our attention away from something vastly more significant. I learned later that G W Bush had been in London where there were huge protests against the war. CNN didn’t want us to know this and so we got to learn everything we never wanted to know about Michael Jackson. Advertising I want to stop wanting what they want me to want. Don’t you think that the deluge of advertising in schools is because major corporations have determined that their biggest and best market is children? What better way to sink families than by parents believing they are denying their children if they don’t get them what they want? Its one thing to deny ourselves, yet we all want our children to have what they believe they want. They don’t want these things; they only think they do because they are programed. Buy the kids what they want - bigger debt sooner. Yet, its not our debt - remember that. Here’s a rule of thumb on buying your children what they will ‘die without’. If it will enrich their lives by offering them a unique experience, then we want them to have this experience; however, if they want something because they will be more acceptable, accumulate more friends, placate their desire to ‘look good’, ‘be popular’, fill a hole in them which ought to be filled by something else - like parental attention, for example - you can pretty much forget about it. We have been programmed to want not only worthless items but also worthless pieces of paper which, we have also been programmed to believe, will get us as many worthless items as we desire and the more we have the happier we’ll be. 31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Complicity (vs. Conspiracy) When we are privy to any information and we choose to ignore it and remain uninvolved, our choice evaporates because the information itself is what involves us. The choice becomes whether we want to remain part of the problem or become part of the solution. There is no fence-sitting in life. We cannot be aware of what is going on and not do any opting. One who ignores what is going on justifies this by pretending he doesn’t have the information he now has. We can’t unlearn anything; we can only change our minds about something based upon what we have learned. There is no going back. The information in this book clashes with the belief system of most of the people on this planet. They uninvolve themselves by calling it “conspiracy theory”. This makes it more difficult for our true selves to do anything about it. They get to remain in their comfort zones from which I contend we are required to remove ourselves. If its comfort you want, life is not the place to be. - Werner Erhard If you see injustice and say nothing, you have taken the side of the oppressor. - Desmund Tutu. If you know something; say so! The fear of doing this will not even register compared with the consequences, for you and your children, of looking the other way. - David Icke No decision is, in itself, a decision. - William James. When I hear, “I don’t believe in conspiracy theories”, what I hear is, “I’ve made up my mind based upon what I’ve been told to think by the Media Mafia conspiring to propagandize via TV, radio, and newspapers; please don’t confuse me with the truth.” What’s true is these people do believe in conspiracy theories - the ones they’ve been fed. If what they believe - what they’ve been told to think - were true, they wouldn’t need to believe it. Belief is of the ego mind and hence, false. When we know something is true, we don’t need to involve our egos. This is why we don’t really have much emotional attachment to the truth. It just is. It is when someone becomes emotional about a subject that I know they only ‘believe’ it. This usually comes up around religious or political beliefs. They are protecting their programing which has settled in the ego mind. The truth is foreign to anyone who argues those two subjects. It is their not knowing which causes the emotional response. Anyone who has certainty, which is from their experience, has no emotional charge on it. Arguing, by definition, is a reaction of the ego. This is why no one wins an argument. There is no win when the ego thinks it has won. The Media are the sycophants of those promoting their agenda but it really is not ‘conspiracy’ - “plotting for treason, murder, sedition, or other evil-doing” (Oxford English Dictionary); it is complicity - “accomplice-ship; partnership in guilt” (OED). The word “theory” means premise yet to be proven. So when one puts it all together, “I don’t believe in conspiracy theories”, it sounds rather weak. I don’t believe in conspiracy theories either. I don’t need to; I know of the evidence of complicity ”. Along with being accused of “believing in conspiracy theories”, I am also accused of being a ‘cynic’. The cynics are right 9 times out of 10. - H. L. Mencken I’m also accused of being a pessimist, yet pessimism is great. I am not distressed about what is about to occur in the world; I look forward to the shift that must take place if we are to escape our prison. Besides, according to Thomas Szasz, pessimists are more often correct. Also, we get to be either ‘right’ or ‘happy’ - ‘right’ when things turn out as bad, or ‘happy’ when they don’t. Optimists are either ‘right’ or ‘worried’ - happily right when things turn out as good yet confused and distraught when they do not. From an emotional perspective, I have never been happier now that I am certain that there is going to be major upheaval. I welcome it - we must wake up from this nightmare and trust our spirit. Usury If I borrow your car and the gas tank is full, how can I return to you more car than I borrowed. I can’t because it doesn’t exist. There is only so much cash available. Someone, somewhere knows precisely how much is in circulation. According to Ron Supinski, of the Public Information Department in San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank claims that FRNs are backed by the power of congress to collect taxes. It costs the FRB 2¢ 32"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"to print a $100 note .... rather good return, I’d say. Isn’t this about a 500,000 % profit? ... and this doesn’t include the interest they put on the note EACH time it is passed. Since what we think is ‘money’ is borrowed into existence, meaning that it simply doesn’t exist until someone puts a signature to some numbers on a promissory note, how can interest be paid? It does not exist. If I borrow into existence (ie: create) $10,000, and this is all that exists, which has to be true because it doesn’t exist until I sign the note with this number on it, where am I going to get the 10% interest to cover the cost of the loan? Borrowing ‘money’ into existence, meaning ‘creating debt funds’, is like drinking sea water. It seems to work temporarily, but the resulting thirst by far exceeds any available means to compensate. There is NO ‘Money’ Powerful industrialists and bankers essentially bribed the politicians in almost every country of the world into giving up their Constitutionally-protected right to print notes for the Treasury. They handed that power over to a private corporation which issued notes called Federal Reserve Notes - not ‘federal’, no ‘reserves’ (well, maybe 10%), and not a true ‘note’ - they are ‘debt notes’. This can be difficult to understand. What we think of as ‘money’ does not exist; it is borrowed into existence. It is not a substance, or a commodity, or anything which simply exists, for example, as water exists. It does not exist until someone creates a debt. That debt can be created only by an equally non-existent entity. This causes ping pong balls to go jumping around in your head, doesn’t it? This non-existent entity is the ‘public’. First, make the distinction that we are the private and all corporations, bureaucracies, governments, etc. are the public - they do not exist except on paper. There is no money. There was, once upon a time - for example, Colonial Script, gold and silver, Lincoln’s Greenbacks, Kennedy’s Silver Certificates. Did you notice that both those presidents were assassinated for creating notes which were not based upon debt? The banksters didn’t like this. They had a monopoly on the currency and weren’t about to let anyone cheat them out of their con game. We neither spend ‘money’, nor are we paid ‘money’. It doesn’t exist. Any ‘money’ you think you have in the form of cash is borrowed the second you put your signature to anything - a cheque, withdrawal slip, an application, a contract - these requests for your signature are ALL for the SOLE purpose of creating debt money. With each signature, you, yes, you go farther and farther into debt. When we ‘borrow money’ from a bank, which seems to be the only entity from which we can borrow, our signature upon a ‘promise to pay’ is not only what gets us the loan but also what immediately repays the loan. Did the bank lend us money? No. There is no money. It didn’t lend ‘money’, it exchanged the credit we created for bank promissory notes. I watch people’s eyes glaze over when I mention this concept so think of this: I take my credit card over to Sears and purchase $100 worth of goods. I sign on the line which states, “I agree to pay...” I do agree to pay, just as soon as they can devise a method for me to do this. Since 1933, when the USA declared bankruptcy and who knows when in Canada (since Canada was on and off the gold standard for some time after the uSA fell to the banksters) public policy (in the uSA: HJR 192 of June 5, 1933, and in Canada, Order in Council, April 10, 1933) has dictated that since there is nothing of substance with which to pay, the best I can do is promise to pay. All public debt will be discharged by the feds. Those who hold the gold pay the debt. The only way to do this is to sign a note with the number attached to it. It is a promissory note, the same as that which we sign in a bank just before we are told they won’t lend us cash. I have asked ‘loan officers’ why they won’t just hand over to me the cash which we’ve just agreed I was going to borrow. They say, “I don’t have the cash right here; I’ll give you a cheque which you can take over to the teller and she’ll either deposit it into your account from which you can then withdraw cash, or you can just cash the cheque.” I ask, “If its right over there with the teller, why can’t you go over for me and get the cash?” They then tell me that I have to endorse the cheque they intend to give me. But I signed for cash. I promise to pay $10,000 plus interest for ... $10,000, not a piece of paper with numbers and a date on it. Why isn’t this a straight exchange - note for cash? Because they want two signatures. Keep in mind that every time we sign anything, we are creating credit, rather, bringing forth our unlimited credit, and if for some reason we don’t receive this credit, count on the fact that someone else did - by stealing our exemption. To boot, we have agreed to it - take a look at the (unilateral and hence, unenforceable) contract, whether it is your driver’s licence or your credit card application. Your exemption is being stolen through your signature. It is worth a fortune. Time to take control, eh? Let’s get back to Sears. When I went into the store for the goods and I made payment, in whatever 33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"form, what did I get for my payment? No, not the goods; I got a receipt. The direct exchange was signature for receipt. The goods were already mine; I just came to collect them. So, the merchant is happy because I signed for the goods; i.e.: he exchanged goods for my signature which that day was worth $100, so his accounts are balanced. He doesn’t see that he exchanged his receipt for my signature. My books are balanced because I exchanged my signature for his receipt, I also happened to get the goods, which were pre-paid. Then, the merchant sends to the bank, my signature along with the hundreds of others which he gathered that day. The bank then transfers funds electronically over to Sears. The bank did not gather up cash (or anything of substance) and send it over to Sears; it transferred to Sears, by the clicking of computer keys (Electronic Funds Transfer), the amount of credit matching, and hence balancing the amount of, the credit slips. I’ll say it again, because it is so stunning: NO MONEY ever left the bank to PAY Sears. The next thing I know I get a bill from VISA for $100. For what? I’ve already ‘paid’ - at least to the extent of my ability. Public Policy has dictated that this is all I can do. How do you want to ‘pay’ for goods which are already yours? Via working forty hours a week? Or via your signature, thereby giving them your tax exemption? Its important that we see the fraudulent banking system as rather outside of normal reality; sort of a middle-man. We ought to work for what we need - a direct exchange. Who deceived us into believing that we ought to work for a piece of paper - a cheque? Then we endorse this paper with our valuable signature. This signature is what creates the amount of funds mentioned on the cheque. Since these funds are debt funds, we just created more debt. Actually, we created the credit against which the entity, which handed you the cheque, will create a matching debt - yet, essentially, we are responsible for the creation of this alleged ‘debt’ because, since there is interest on debt funds, we climbed deeper into an inescapable chasm. The bank hands us other pieces of paper which we take out into the market place. Although you believe you bought goods, with these debt notes, you can’t possibly own these goods because you gave nothing of substance in exchange. All you did was double the debt. The $300,000 invoice for your house is based upon liability funds. If you hand over $300,000 in FRN/BCN you have not discharged or zeroed the debt - you have made the debt $600,000. You do not own anything for which you have not exchanged something of substance. You have only equitable title. Legal title can change hands only upon direct exchange (no middle man) of something of substance, ie: your labour. If you labour and you are given liability funds and you trade them for something, it vitiates not only your labour but also that which you think you bought. Why not simply labour for what you want? Labour is real and what you want, e.g.: your house, is real. Both become a fiction when you trade both for and from nothing. You have been programmed into believing you need money. Au contraire, it is money which keeps us from having what we want . The more ‘money’ we have, the more debt we have. WHY do we think we want ‘money’? I become quite perturbed when I hear a ‘financial advisor’ suggest, “Get out of debt!”. Listeners presume he means, “Pay off your debt” and this is not what he means - well, maybe it is, yet, if so it is because he doesn’t know. Once I heard Suze Ormond talk. After 30 seconds I screamed, “AARRRGH!” and walked away. Don’t listen to these government-educated ‘experts’. “Get out of debt” means to discharge the debt and quit accumulating debt notes. It also means to put those things which you have slave-laboured to acquire, into Your Name. He who dies with the most cash LOSES. Cash represents your labour and the amount of cash you have in your possession represents the worthlessness of your labour. How can we repay more than exists? Only our labour can begin to do this, so the banksters capture our labour in the form of taxes. They give us some of the proceeds of our labour for the purpose of keeping us in the dark about their scheme, yet take a huge amount in order to cover the interest on the loan which we lent them . EVERY tax we pay goes to ‘pay’ the interest on this loan that we lent them (or is kept by the politicians to enrich themselves). When one takes into consideration all these taxes - direct and indirect, excise and impost: income (federal, state/provincial, and local), sales, GST, Sin taxes (alcohol, tobacco), permits (firearm, building, septic, well), endless banking service fees (credit cards, stocks, bonds, accounts...), endless fines and penalties (traffic, invoice late fees...), travel (flight, hotel, rental), capital gains, corporate income, court costs, licences (marriage, dog, hunting, fishing, driving, piloting, all professional, all business), insurance (property, life, medical, vehicle, employment, workers compensation), fuel permit, gasoline (about 37%), inheritance, inventory, IRS/CRA interest and penalty charges (tax on top of tax), luxury, property, real estate, social security/Canada pension, truckers road usage, registration fees (birth, all professions, all vehicles), school, sports, communication (TV, cable/satellite, internet, fax, endless telephone service fees (universal, federal, state/prov., and local charges, surcharges, minimum usage.... ) tolls (road, bridge, tunnel), utility (water, gas, electricity, garbage), and the biggest, most insidious of them all: inflation which is tax on the ‘money’ itself, .... breathe ... we are being taxed well beyond any bracket which we 34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"might have previously estimated. If you add it up, and no one can do this and remain sane, you will see that 85% of your labour is going to ‘pay’... NOTHING. No, you are not paying to keep your country functioning. You are paying to make rich the politicians who have tricked you into believing their scam. People still think, for some absurd reason, that the game the politicians play, called ‘legislation’ or ‘law-making’, has something to do with us - the people. The politicians’ game is for themselves, not for us. If we make rules in our own homes or communal groups, do the politicians abide by our rules? No. Should they have to? No, so why would we possibly think that their rules apply to us? A friend once justified her paying income tax by saying, “I consider the income tax just rent for living in this country.” I told her, “This is tantamount to paying rent to live in a house you already OWN.” A true government’s purpose is solely to serve us and protect our inherent rights; we owe it nothing. You are labouring to pay for something that is unpayable - interest on a loan which you lent them . It is unpayable for several reasons: 1. the loan itself was not of substance so how can you repay something that never existed (except on paper) in the first place? 2. the energy for the interest does not exist since all the ‘money’ exists only on paper, and there is no more than that because it was lent into existence. So how can there be any more ‘money’ with which to pay interest than what already doesn’t exist. I know this sounds convoluted and you get to be right about that; it IS convoluted. This is how this scam has managed to stay alive - go back to Hitler’s comment about the bigger the lie, the easier it is to sell. The best example, of how they turned the tables on us, is your depositing into your bank account funds upon which you hoped to earn some interest and finding out that on your next statement, rather than paying you interest on the deposit (funds you lent the bank so it could lend out at a higher rate of interest than they agreed to pay you) they are charging you the interest; and in fact this is precisely what is occurring in the form of ‘service fees’. You can see how desperate the gov’t is about getting funds to pay the interest on the loan which the banksters lent them. Banksters make loan sharks look like nice guys. Loan sharks only smash your knee-caps; banksters hold you in slavery your entire life. The only reason you tolerate this is because they allow you some pleasures in life, yet, at a huge cost. Its rather like the frog in the tepid water who stays until it boils and then he dies, only because he doesn’t notice. If we were not indoctrinated gradually into this slavery we would notice; it is this insidious inflation - the devaluation of ‘money’ - that has encroached upon us at rather a slow rate. However, the feds, now in panic, have expedited the process because the banksters are about to call in the loans if they are not paid, and the plan for global control is upon us. Whenever someone takes a ‘loan’ from a financial institution, the signed promissory note is ‘deposited’ to the bank's credit. The bank then issues a check to the borrower. The bank’s books are now balanced. When the bank deposits this to the asset side of its ledger, the bank is indebted to the borrower. In other words, the borrower actually originates the credit so he winds up paying back, with interest, what he originally lent , but the bank doesn’t repay the ‘credit’ which the borrower issued. In fact, if there is collateral involved, the bank stands to confiscate this property if the ‘borrower’/creator of the credit does not pay back over three (3!) times the amount of his own creation. The entity which is entitled to the pay- back of ‘borrowed’ funds is always the ‘principal’ and that is you - the creator of the funds. The property which you think you own (and this includes your body) already belongs to the IMF and soon they will make this known by asking for proof of title which you cannot evidence. Birth Certificates are only evidence that the Title of Origin (legal title) rests elsewhere. You do NOT have legal title to your body, unless you have claimed it. This is why you are not permitted to put particular substances into it. When the feds become desperate enough they will come for all your property, including your body. They will demand all collateral ‘now’. Its nothing personal; its just business. This is the reason that more people every day are in (debtor’s) prison. All crime is commercial in nature. This is the reason for more and more traffic citations: the police are no longer peace officers; their role now is ‘revenue/ tax collector’. This is their job. Don’t let them kid you about why they want you to wear your seatbelt. It has nothing to do with saving your life - it has to do with protecting the potential revenue/ tax which you will earn/ pay over your lifetime, not to mention save the insurance companies (also corporate/ non-existent entities) the cost of claims. Don’t kill the goose which lays the golden egg. I’m not making this up. So, are we clear on government racketeering? If I borrow something from you and hand you collateral to guarantee you get back what you lent me, then upon return of said loan, you will hand me back the collateral. Usually with a personal loan it would be something of substance. In the case of the banks, 35"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"however, your collateral is your signature and if you fail to ‘repay’ the loan of credit they will come after you, but for what? Remember that debt exists only on paper; therefore, it can be discharged only with other pieces of paper ; it can not be ‘paid’ because there exists nothing with which to pay. This is Public Policy, which states that public debt can no longer be ‘paid’; it can be only discharged, and you’d better not go against Public Policy..... it has nothing to do with law (which we’ll get to shortly). Your promissory note IS the collateral and if you ‘repay’ the loan with the proceeds of your labour and then request the return of your collateral, the promissory note, they might indeed return the original note to you but not before having lent the alleged asset - the funds, in fact they’ve lent it several times. Your signature/ note is hypothecated at least seven times (according to the FRB in San Francisco) for at least 90% of the amount which you authorized by your signature. So, for your $10,000 loan of credit, which cost you at least twice that and which cost the bank nothing , the bank will profit over half a million dollars. WE are in the wrong biz. If we get 25 of us together and each kick in enough to pay for the licence to print $$$, about $150,000 USD or 1/4 million CAD, we can start sending out cheques just as finance companies/ credit card banks, etc. do. Start-up cost is low - just the cost of printing cheques, plus postage, and the return is a windfall - literally. We can make millions in very short order. Remember the bank which gave me $3,500.00 for Christmas in exchange for my signature. I presume your ethics, as mine, will not permit you to do this. The Commerce Game Since we are unable to pay debt, we are also unable to incur/ create debt. ‘Money’ is now created by bankers. Goldsmiths learned that they could issue gold certificates as ‘promise to pay’, rather than moving gold coins around. The present day bank notes represent the confidence of the people to be able to exchange them for goods and services. Its all just bookkeeping entries - shifting of credit and debit. We used to have real money, now only our ‘strawman’ has worthless notes. The gov’t created the strawman in order to engage us in their game. The strawman’s name is similar to ours, only it is in upper case - it shows up on everything which you think identifies you, but the identification is government-issued. All contracts we signed have the strawman name, not ours, on them. Have you ever noticed that your driver’s licence, bank statement, and any bill that you receive is in all capital letters? Even the now ‘corrected’ Cdn. Driver’s Licences lists ‘last name’ first which still makes it a corporate name because sovereigns don’t have ‘names’, they have titles. How is it that the feds can take our houses, property, bank accounts, children, cars, etc.? Because we don’t own them. Living souls do not have ‘names’; we have descriptions, e.g: Smith, from Blacksmith, the description of one’s trade. This is why the native peoples’ ‘names’ are the way they are. Only corporations have names; hence, when a cop or judge asks you your name, it would be foolish to answer him for several reasons: 1. You don’t have a ‘name’ so you would by lying; 2. What you believe to be your ‘name’ can’t possibly be ‘truth’; it can be only hearsay because you don’t have first-hand knowledge that this is you. It is only by hearing this name repeatedly in reference to you over the years that you believe this name refers to you. You do not know it as ‘fact’. 3. When you state a ‘name’ before the court, you have contracted with the court, thereby granting it jurisdiction. Remember the ‘name’ is the government-created corporation which they want you to believe is you. If you state it is you, you have just contracted with thugs. You’ll recall that when the ‘judge’ asked me my name, I responded, “If I tell you my name will I have entered into a contract with you?” and I was promptly thrown out of court. 4. Giving hearsay evidence in ‘court’ is fraudulent, not to mention “contempt of court”. Remember Peter Fonda: “Try not paying your taxes and find out who owns your house.” We don’t own anything. It appears as if our strawman does, only it is a fiction and so can’t hold legal title (a Manufacturer’s Certificate of Origin). The creator of this fictional entity (the government) holds the legal title. If the strawman incurs a debt, we are held as surety to ‘pay’ it, and yet there is nothing with which to pay, not to mention, why are we paying for something we can’t own and have only ‘use’ privileges? But the fictitious strawman can pay fictitious funds (FRN/BCN). So that the strawman can pay a debt, the banksters set up an account for it. This is your SSN/SIN. Notice your name/title isn’t on that card. The corporation name is in upper case letters. The gov’t now refers to us as ‘human resources’ - the collateral on the national debt. In the US Government’s demolition of the World Trade Center, the living souls who died were referred to as “collateral damage”. This tells us that we are considered ‘collateral’ by the government. Yet one must be 36"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"the holder in due course of the resource in order to use it as collateral and interestingly, the gov’t holds our birth certificates - our warehouse receipts. It appears that the feds are the holder in due course of our bodies, our labour, our finances, our property, our lives. They have legal title, we have only equitable title - we are allowed only the use of our bodies, finances, property, all of which are owned by the gov’t, yet the privilege of our ‘using’ them demands a ‘use tax’. By the way, the demolition of the WTC was to wipe out corporate debt. How can a phenomenal debt, created by the corporations of this world, be proven if all the evidence of said debt were lost in those collapsed towers? “Ground Zero” - the balance on the debt. I read about a man in the UK, John, who defended himself and his wife against two intruders by gaining control of a knife which one was wielding. One escaped and John stabbed the other who died. John was held by police, for how long I don’t know, but most people reading this story must have thought he was being held for murder and are wondering how absurd the laws have gotten when a man is held for murder in the name of self-defence! But it has nothing to do with murder. All crime is commercial crime. The feds have convinced us we are corporate entities and John impeded commerce. The Common Law which applies to all living souls is: We are free to do what we please, as long as we do not infringe on the life, liberty, property, or rights of another. It does not allow for any government to prosecute or fine us for victimless crimes. Statute laws have arisen for this purpose, but their power is limited by common sense and by the resolve of those who would stand up for their natural rights. One can be fined only if he has entered into or breached a contract. Under common law, however, a contract must be knowingly, voluntarily, and intentionally entered into or it is unenforceable. Remember that one of the requirements is full disclosure. Government departments are aware of this and circumvent it by intimidating us into signing agreements that are meant to void common law rights. This one law which takes all real crime into account has now been replaced by over sixty million statutes, all of which compel one to do something. Law cannot compel performance. These 60,000,000 statutes are all based upon commerce. So John is being held because of the only ‘crime’ now in existence - that of ‘impeding commerce’. What commerce? Let’s take a look at precisely who these intruders were and why they were in John’s house. They were ‘collateral’ belonging to the gov’t. John did not kill another living soul; he destroyed government property - collateral. Since thieves rarely break into occupied houses, we can safely assume that they were on drugs, desperate for something to steal and sell for funds for their next fix. Who is the creditor of these funds? The banksters - specifically, the CIA/ drug cartel. So, John’s taking the intruder out of the commerce game puts a damper on the expected funds which this man would have paid the banksters during his remaining lifetime, not to mention having funded the CIA to do even more biz - that of addicting kids to drugs. John thwarted business - this is why he was held - he was held as surety for his strawman since he was not the holder in due course of his strawman, so he likely will be charged, but with what? The courts cannot let the cat out of the bag on this commerce game, so once the attorneys and the courts collect an extortive amount of the strawman’s funds, via John, from his attempt to defend himself, they will drop charges which were never laid in the first place. I’m sure John has no idea what is going on and he will never understand until he learns the commerce game and how he can claim his strawman to perfect a superior claim to his debtor strawman which will no longer be the debtor of the banksters. In fact, all he had to do was decline to contract with the feds, but most are so unaware of the power of contract. Speaking of drugs, here is what Norman D. Livergood has to say about the ‘War on Drugs’: “ It 1. provides cover for US intervention and control 2. adds to military budget 3. increases foreign sales of US weaponry 4. keeps price of drugs up and costs down “Domestically the drug war is incarcerating millions of felons on the basis of mandatory minimum sentencing, provides profits for privatized prison companies, providing funds to US organizations and individuals through drug money-laundering: covert agencies for black-funding, politicians and bankers hired to protect drug revenues, politicians who receive drug money campaign contributions, inflating police spending and revenues - seizing assets, increasing repression in inner cities, and masking attack on civil liberties. In the uSA (2% of the world’s population) 7 people are in prison for every 1 in every other country in the world. “Drug use is down from 1979 but this is due to millions in prison, along with the fear of what crack can do. There are two Approaches: 1. incarceration for users and military action to stop drug production internationally, OR 2. decriminalization and treatment. 37"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"“Remember Prohibition. All the nonsense stopped once alcohol became legal again. Why would those in charge of the Drug War want to kill the goose that laid the golden eggs? The drug cartel/ banksters/ economic elite are making a killing on this “Drug War”. We’re now awaiting 300 tons of Heroin from the Afghan opium.” In the USA, the prison business is huge. Under the guise of punishment for a crime, prison owners have extremely cheap labour at their disposal. At least 86%, and possibly 94%, of all prisoners are non- violent. They are there because they contracted with thugs - those who convinced them that doing drugs, most of which is marijuana and possession thereof, and ‘under the law’ they are to be punished. Now they are working for pennies an hour. The drug biz is only the means to the end which is prison. Prisoners’ bonds are sold on the securities market to A G Edwards and Merrill Lynch. A felon is worth about $4 million, the city of the prison gets $40 million. Investors offer to buy for 40% and increases minimum 200% for bank securities. Over 50% of money market bonds are purchased in the Orient. The stockholders are the owners of Correction Corp of America which owns all the private prisons and sell the commercial paper on each prisoner/ slave. Paine Weber is the prime stockholder. If you hold stock with these international businesses you are betraying your fellows by keeping them in prison for a commercial crime, yet not the true crime of infringement on the life, liberty, property, or rights of another living soul. You wonder how the USA can afford a war? The banksters are selling your fellow living souls as goods which are warehoused in the prisons of the corporate USA/CA. Sixteen (16) pages of corporations are identified as involved in Prison Profit. Don't bother to ask to look at their books - this aspect of their biz is not published. hmmm. All investment firms work for the USA/CA. If you are involved, you might want to re-assess your intentions from a more ethical perspective. Every prisoner bond has a Committee on Uniform Securities Identification number so you can track the trade and how much the principal (the prisoner) is worth, the funds of which he’ll never see. When will we learn that ‘teaching someone a lesson’ never teaches anything but resentment -- that it only inspires the recipient to greater acts of defiance . - Harry Browne The ‘War on Drugs’ was designed not to work ... for us. It was designed to work for the Banksters. Same as Nixon’s ‘War on Cancer’- it worked for the Medical Mafia, in particular the Genocidal Pharmaceutical Industry, not for those who have developed cancer. The gov’t acts for our strawman which appears to us that it is we. In order to take back control of our lives, we must take control of our strawman. Fortunately, we now know how to do this. Since living souls can not ‘pay’ debt (HJR 192 /Order in Council), we can now only ‘discharge’ debt. Since all debt is created on paper, all debt can be discharged with other pieces of paper. When you take control of your strawman, you will no longer be held as surety for it and you can discharge its debts with your signature - a promise to pay, the same way the banksters do it.

I don’t think there is one movie about Nazi Germany where some English- speaking actor with a bad accent doesn’t demand, “Yah papahs, pleahs?”I don’t think this is any coincidence. Papers must have meant something. I do not think they are referring to passports. To what they refer are papers indicating whether one is a creditor or a debtor, whether one is the holder-in-due- course of one’s assets or is being held as surety for alleged debt, and whether one has legal title or only equitable title to one’s body, rights, and property. We must get our papers in order. It is not difficult to do. But we have to want to learn and know it and stop believing the propaganda. Naturally the common people don't want war: Neither in Russia, nor in England, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All I have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country. - Goering at the Nuremberg Trials In 1992, George H.W. Bush told White House reporter Sarah McClendon: If the people were to ever find out what we have done, we would be chased down the streets and lynched.  Federal Income Tax “These people just don't want to pay their fair share.” A woman once told me, “I owe Revenue Canada a fortune. Thank God there are no more debtor’s prisons.” She didn’t understand that debtor’s prison is ALL there is. Since the only crime is “impeding commerce”, this is the only thing that will imprison anyone these days. You might well wonder, ‘What about murder?’ Remember John. The feds consider everyone a taxpayer and intend to collect a certain amount of $$ through taxes up until that amount hits a peak and yet before they are required to begin to return $$ in the form of Social Security/ Canada Pension (SS/ CP), not to mention Medicare, etc. There actually is a line; take a look at actuaries. If someone kills another before that line is reached, the gov’t regards it as a financial loss and therefore prosecutes the murderer for ‘impeding commerce’ even though it appears to be under the guise of ‘taking the life of another’. Its books won’t balance. The gov’t doesn’t acknowledge living souls; it sees us as surety for a limited liability corporation (LLC) which is a government-created fictitious entity. But the real living soul, the surety/ accommodation party, will wind up going to jail for creating a debit on its books. What was the outcome of all the hurricanes in Florida? No more medicare costs for the feds - the majority of those who are either dead or ‘missing’ was the elderly; I told you the feds are desperate. Weather control has been used for over a decade in the USA; see: http://www.weatherwars.info/ Those hurricanes were most certainly strategically planned. Also, families of those who are allegedly ‘missing’ do not receive any insurance benefits because ‘missing’ is not one of the terms and conditions of the insurance contract - only ‘dead’. Florida hurricanes were designed for the same purpose as the gov’t demolitions of the WTC - to reduce corporate debt. When Nelson A. Rockefeller was being questioned by Congress prior to his installment to a government appointment, he was asked, “How much money did you make last year?” Rockefeller answered, “$650 million.” “And how much Income Tax did you pay on that?”, they asked. “Nothing”, was the reply. If you pay more taxes than Rockefeller does, don’t you think that you need more education? Research into who/what is liable to ‘pay’ income tax in Canada reveals in the very first line, to what (notice I didn’t say, ‘to whom ’) this applies. Needless to say, the equivalent from the Internal Revenue Code in the USA reveals the same thing. 39"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Income Tax Act, Canada, R.S.C. 1985, Chapter 1 (5th Supp.), updated to December 31, 2000 An Act respecting Income Taxes      SHORT TITLE 1. This Act may be cited as the income Tax Act. R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, s. 1.      PART I - INCOME TAX - DIVISION A - LIABILITY FOR TAX Tax payable by persons resident in Canada 2. (1) An income tax shall be paid, as required by this Act, on the taxable income for each taxation year of every person residing in Canada at any time in the year. This says it all. You are not a ‘person’. The definition of ‘person’ in Interpretive Laws of Canada and under the 14th Amendment in the USA is: a corporation. Remember that your strawman is a corporate entity created by the government. If you are the surety then you are liable for its taxes, however, if you are the secured party, the creditor to its debtor, then you have first lien against it and the feds have zero control over it and hence no jurisdiction over you. YOU do NOT owe ‘income’ tax; besides, no one has even been able to define ‘income’. Remember the spluttering IRS agent who couldn’t find in the IR Manual where it is written that I am required to pay a tax on my income. Go to H&R Block and pull the same stunt - it makes them crazy. Only if you’re bored that day, though, because you don’t really want to waste much time on their tax fraud stuff - knowing it is a joke might be enough for you. However, if you’re like me and you like to annoy the bureaucrats, trust me that it is very good entertainment. Or ring up CRA, ask them, and listen to them squirm. I now have in my possession ‘Confirmation of Agreement’ evidencing that IRS Commissioner, Mark W. Everson, Commissioner of CRA, Alan Nymark, and Minister of National Revenue Canada, John McCallum, all agree that we are not required to pay income tax, or any of the other taxes I listed above - unless we agree to the terms of their contract. Who would do that? Most people pay taxes on ‘income’ even though it is not their ‘income’ - it belongs to the Strawman. How can we have a tax liability on ‘income’ we never received? Even if it were we who received it there is no law requiring anyone to pay any tax, never mind an ‘income’ tax, but Canadians, in particular, justify the confiscation of their earnings by saying that there is a law, which is not true - not even in Canada. They complain about paying taxes yet they defend it. This conflict of emotions is tantamount to the Stockholm Syndrome - the behaviour of kidnap victims who, over time, become sympathetic to their captors (named after a 1973 hostage incident in Stockholm; after six days of captivity in a bank, several kidnap victims actually resisted rescue attempts and later even refused to testify against their captors). Captives begin to identify with their captors initially as a defence mechanism out of fear of violence. Small acts of kindness (read: ‘government benefits’) by the captor are magnified, since finding perspective in a hostage situation is, by definition, impossible. Rescue attempts (by those of us who intend for the sheeple to WAKE UP!) are also regarded as threat, since it is likely the captive would be injured during such attempts. So, it stands to psychological reason that mavericks like me are not trusted, in fact, I am feared - even more than the hostage situation in which most people are unwittingly being held by their governments. People’s lying to themselves is what saddens me. Those who pay taxes are aggravating the problem; they believe they have no choice - they have been held hostage. Whether they pay the tax or not is not important in the grand scheme. What IS important is what is going on in their minds, which happens to be fear. There is no freedom, no aliveness, where there is fear. People actually lie awake at night in fear of how they are going to pay their ‘taxes’. It cracks me up, but my heart goes out to them. Their angst is completely unwarranted. Your ‘income tax’ does NOT go to operate the Federal Government. You make out the check to the IRS/Receiver General - CRA (both private corporations). Who endorses it? Look at the back of the cheque. See who got the $$$? (a private corporation) the FRB, Inc./Bank of Canada, Inc. Then the cheque goes to The Governor-Secretary of the Treasury of the IMF, Inc. of the United Nations. Those who pay taxes on ‘income’ are giving away hard-earned ‘money’ to the United Nations, a world wide Communist organization, the intent of which is Collectivism. Five months of your income went to support Collectivism (I’d say, ‘Communism’ but this causes people’s minds to close, and the “I don’t believe in conspiracy theories” kicks in, so I say Collectivism. Tax funds do NOT run the gov’t or any of its alleged programs; the IMF runs the gov’t; your $$$ is inconsequential to gov’t operation. Taxing is simply the means to confiscate your personal power. No sovereign can be taxed; only corporate entities can be taxed and only by the agreement of the principle/ surety - you - if indeed you agreed to it. Why might you voluntarily, willingly, and knowingly do that? You wouldn’t. You’ve been tricked into it. 40"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Many people highly resent paying taxes. Since they feel thwarted in being able to do anything about it, they figure out ways to get something back for paying into a system which doesn’t work for them. They exact their dues by frequenting hospitals, doctors, filing insurance claims, workman’s comp, etc. and feel no compunction about doing this because they truly believe they’ve ‘paid’ for it. All this does is keep them locked into the belief that they’re ‘getting’ something. The problem is, because ‘intention is everything’, their behaviour is fueled by resentment. This won’t work for them in the long run. Worse, they become dependent upon gov’t benefits. We can not afford to be dependent upon any entity which doesn’t have our best interests at heart. Better, by far, would be to release the fear we have surrounding our beliefs about who we are not. VAT (Value Added Tax = Sales Tax, etc.) This is just another means to confiscate your funds and your personal power. GST (goods and services tax) is another ‘use’ tax which we are not required to pay, not only because there is no law compelling us but also because of who we are, which we have been persuaded to forget. I like to carry around “Tax Exempt Status” card or a “Tax Exemption Certificate” which I show the owner/ manager of places I frequent to prove I am not obligated to pay any tax, never mind I am not obligated to pay for anything. Not only did I already pre-pay whatever it is I want but also I am not subject to any ad valorem tax ( VAT). Again, sovereigns are not required to pay tax. We are sovereign until we acquiesce to behaviour which vitiates this fact. Do you think the queen is tax exempt? Is the Pope Zionist? So, we are tax exempt and all we have to do is say so, even though we have been taught no longer to believe in our sovereignty. My prime concern is gas because the total tax is 37%. I know I’m not required to pay it; I even have the corroboration of CRA, however, I am having trouble with the oil corporations. After perusing my gas receipts I sent the CFO (chief financial officer) a true bill for $146.00 He has yet to fork over so I paid for gas one day with a Transfer Instrument. He called the cops on me because his fiduciary (yes, a bankster) didn’t recognize it. I straightened it out with the RCMP and told the CFO that I wanted the name of the officer at his bank because the Receiver General probably wants to know who is not honouring my transfer instruments, particularly since he and I have an agreement that they will be honoured. I probably won’t bother to file a PPSA against this twit for a measly $146 in GST and fuel taxes, the financial liability of which he has unlawfully passed along to you and me. Law Should I abide by the rules until they’re changed, or help speed the change by breaking them? - Ashleigh Brilliant A cop once stopped me for seatbelt violation. I asked him, “Who is the injured party?” “The State of New Mexico.” The State of New Mexico doesn’t exist; New Mexico state exists. When I asked him, “If I were to call The State of New Mexico to the stand, who would show up?” He didn’t know how to answer me because no one would or could show up. No name in upper case can be an injured party because it is a fiction, an entity created by the government. Only flesh and blood living souls can be ‘injured’. So, he asked me for a driver licence which I didn’t have because having one would grant him immediate jurisdiction over me which, as yet, he didn’t have. I asked if I were required to have one and if so, could he provide for me the law which compels me. Later, he did actually show me the statute, “all operators must be licensed”, but I noticed that it did not apply to me , nor did it detail any consequences for said ‘operator’, which also was not I, if this person were not licensed. There was no implementing regulation - the enforcement clause. It was simply one of many traffic codes which apply only to those who thought them up. They have no clout with those of us who don’t agree to them. Laws can’t compel; they can only protect. If the law doesn’t protect me, the law doesn’t apply to me. Hence, there is only one law - the golden rule and the breaking of this law results in the infringement upon the life, liberty, property, or rights of a natural being who has every right to seek just compensation for the injury. Everything else is statute and applies only to those who are subject to them - namely those who thought them up. All codes, rules, regulations, statutes, and ordinances apply only to those involved within the departments who documented them. What?! So, the Internal Revenue Code applies only to IR Agents, CCRA codes apply only to government employees - and anyone else who might care to contract with those 41"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"agencies. Do you? I don’t. The function of the law is not to provide justice or to preserve freedom. The function of the law is to keep those who hold power, in power. - Gerry Spence - From Freedom to Slavery, 1993 When only lawyers can understand the law, then only lawyers should be required to obey the law. - Chuck Conces Under current law, it is a crime for a private citizen to lie to a government official, but not for the government official to lie to the people. - Donald M. Fraser Since ‘Equality under Law is Paramount and Mandatory by Law’, and we know everyone in court lies - its a dog and pony show - why was Martha Stewart sentenced to prison for .... ‘lying’ ? It is because she agreed not to. Since contract is the only law, she breached the contract wherein she agreed ‘to tell the truth....’. Had she declined ‘to tell the truth’, she would not be in prison. There is no law against ‘lying’. When you break the big laws, you do not get liberty; you do not even get anarchy. You get the small laws (codes, rules, regulations, statutes, ordinances) . - G. K. Chesterton The minute you read something you can’t understand, you can almost be sure it was drawn up by a lawyer. - Will Rogers Minding one’s business is the only moral law. - Frederic Bastiat, The Law I have been asked rather sarcastically, “So, you think you are above the law...” Of course , I am above the law. Bob Dylan said, “to live outside the law you must be honest”. It makes me more honourable. The creator is always above the created. If man made laws, then man is above what he made. I never said I was above the Creator’s laws, I claim to be above man’s laws, mostly because they don’t apply to me. But that’s not my point here. Think of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein. This is an example of the created being above the creator. Did it work for Dr. Frankenstein to create something more powerful than himself? Why then, would we think it would work for us? Stopping at a Stop sign when we can see well in advance of the intersection that there is no reason to stop is just being subject to idiocy. Is it our intention, in this example, to serve a Stop sign or was it our intention to create the sign in order to serve us? Why are we bowing to it ? Are you saying, “But I stop so the the police won’t charge me with not stopping at the Stop sign.” The role of police is changed. When I was a child, I was taught, “The policeman is your friend. If you become lost, find a policeman (who would, in those days, be walking his beat, deterring shop theft by his mere presence, so it would be easy to find one on almost any street corner) and he’ll bring you home.” Mums would be so grateful that he would be invited in for tea and biscuits. I have been obliged to teach my children, “The policeman is not your friend. If you become lost and go to a policeman, he might bring you home but he will take me to jail for child neglect and for allowing my child to get lost.” Remember, the presumption is that my children don’t belong to me but to the state and I would be charged with neglect of their property. It just so happens that my boys do belong to me because I have actively rebutted that presumption. Actually, my sentiments towards police have been learned as, I started out liking them. When I was 20 I was hitch-hiking up north in Ontario to visit my boyfriend. A cop stopped me and I thought I was in deep trouble. As it turned out, he truly did care for my welfare and stopped a car with a bunch of kids and told the driver to take me to Fern Resort in Orillia. The cop gave me the proverbial police escort to the exit ramp, and the kids thought it was a hoot and took me directly to my destination. I am reminded of the story of a fellow in Michigan who has five children, the first four of whom have birth certificates. The youngest was born at home and hence has no birth certificate (same as mine). One day the dad was in a store with his kids and was yelling at one of them. A ‘public-minded’ woman overheard this and, like all good informants, telephoned Child Protective Services to report child abuse. The next day the cops came by and confiscated all five of his children. The following day the cops came by and returned the youngest, saying, “This one’s not ours.” This is reason enough to make sure your children belong to you and not the state. For you Canadians who think that your public servants are above this type of seeming theft, think again. It is not theft. If you have signed over your children to the public via the birth registration I suggest you get your papers in order to prevent the feds from collecting their collateral - those whom you call ‘my children’ - for the interest on the loan. So, what is the job of policemen these days? It is not “to serve and protect”, unless this refers to ‘serve 42"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"and protect the World Banksters’. Their sole purpose is to collect revenue for the interest on the debt due to the bankruptcy. They are no longer ‘Peace Officers’. The Motor Vehicle Dept./ Dept. of Transportation (MVD/DOT) are under the Tax and Revenue Dept. What does this tell you? This is why there are so many idiotic statutes which are a result of Admiralty Law which simply do not apply to living souls; they apply to corporate entities. So how is it we get stuck with the fine if the statutes don’t apply to us? Since laws cannot compel performance, there can be no law telling a property owner that he must build his house on a particular area of his property. Because, what if he doesn’t? Upon whose rights is he infringing? Well, possibly his neighbour, in which case the neighbour would be obliged to file a signed, sworn complaint, ideally also signed by a deposable witness, and have a jury decide if he is indeed an injured party. Laws cannot do anything but protect the life, liberty, property, and rights of a living soul. Laws are to serve us; we are not here to serve laws. “if your laws don’t protect me, your laws do not apply to me.” So, yes, we are above the ‘law’(when the word ‘law’ refers to ‘statutes’). The problem is now statutes. Statutes are compelling. They seem to tell us everything we are obliged to do and everything we can’t do. Statutes have replaced the true ONE LAW. Where before, we could be found guilty for actively breaking the only law there was, we can now be found guilty for doing ‘nothing’, meaning neglecting to perform precisely as the statute dictates. Since there are so many, this will occur automatically just in the affairs of daily life. That cliché, ‘ignorance of the law is no excuse’ was true when ‘the law’ to which it referred was the only law we were required to know. But since that one law no longer exists, except in our hearts, that cliché now applies only to statutes. ‘Ignorance of the statutes is no excuse.’ Ignorance of the statutes is EVERY excuse because there are 60,000,000 of them, 59,999,973 of which no one has informed you. Trust me, you are guilty of ‘disobeying’ some, if not many. What happened? Attorneys make up statutes. So a few questions come to mind. 1) To whom do these statutes apply? 2) Who benefits when one does not adhere to statutes? 3) What is the purpose of having so many statutes, codes, rules, regulations, ordinances, legislation in the first place? 4) Since when can attorneys make laws? - rather, statutes? 5) isn’t law-making the job of gov’t? 6) Why would any representative of the people enact statutes which don’t serve his constituents? The “Trading with the Enemy Act” of 1917 reclassified us all as ‘belligerents’ under an emergency situation (actually a declaration of war). So your rights were suspended and a strawman created with an SSN/SIN. Since the politicians did away with the common law and other law which constituted the traditionally vested right of the people, what was put in its place? Commercial Law. This is why people lose trying to argue ‘Constitutional rights’. Courts are military tribunals sitting in summary court martial proceedings against civilians. Constitutional and common law arguments are not allowed in such courts. If we were to go back to the common law, as brutal as it might have been, the entire system of welfare, income taxes, bureaucracy, codes, ordinances, regulations, bylaws, legislation, and rules would cease to exist. Attorneys The Legal Profession has no more to do with ‘law’ than the Medical Profession has to do with ‘health’. So, when you hear nonsense such as, “practising law / medicine without a licence”, notice that the accused is usually practising ‘health’ or its counterpart in ‘law’ where a licence isn’t required. A licence is acquired only by those who choose to be under the jurisdiction of the entity issuing said licence. Those of us who choose to remain free make certain not to obtain any licences at all. A ‘licence to practise law” is procured by an attorney from the client who hires him and, until such time, does not have ‘a licence to practise law’. Yes, he has a bar card but this has nothing to do with a licence to take a case which must be obtained from the one who hires him. Consequently this is a great question to ask an attorney whom you don’t want involved in your commercial affairs. I like to tell them that I don’t give them permission to make a legal determination about me, because, until I do, they have no venue or jurisdiction. They are a stray looking for a home. They have nowhere near the power they like you to think they have. So, you want to be an ‘attorney’; here is your ‘job description’: - prosecute on behalf of IRS/CRA in order to imprison one for ‘failure to file’; - be appointed to (foisted upon) us by a ‘judge’ upon our being accused of a crime; - reject our filing of private documents into the public record 43"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"- initiate and file all criminal complaints (we are prohibited) - confiscate property & funds from marital partners; dictate child custody during divorce proceedings - regulate private property via land use, planning laws, and codes - advise employers to confiscate funds via withholding tax from paycheques - approve the confiscation, by Child Protection Agents, of children from their families - begin foreclosure proceedings when too many mortgage payments are missed; - confiscate property when property taxes aren’t paid; - pilfer our estate via probate after our death; - turn into a ‘crime’ an activity which has been natural and lawful for centuries, yet, due to current legislation, now requires a licence; - initiate actions against us for committing a crime which, until recently, was a lawful activity; - reap hefty fees for exaggerating personal injury claims causing insurance premiums to sky-rocket; - claim to be able to handle personal disputes better than those involved; - complicate simple contracts between 2 parties to where they are completely incomprehensible; - file unnecessary, embellished paperwork for what would normally be considered simple claims; - depersonalize and complicate intimate processes such as adoption; - be the only one allowed into a jail cell even though a friend might better assist us; - play both sides of the ‘court’; - through the BAR police your own, be in charge of accreditation of Law Schools, determine the curriculum in Law Schools by granting or refusing accreditation, make and enforce laws designed to work only for you, make and enforce statutes which are impossible not to violate because there are over 60 million of them. - be the power behind all agencies which control the rest of us; - be a henchman and revenue collector for the IMF/ International Banksters; - become ‘power of attorney’ when we hire you (grant you a ‘licence to practise law’), thereby rendering ourselves ‘incompetent’; Once I told an attorney, with as straight a face as I could muster, that I truly believed that he was an honest fellow. He responded with, “Well, I try to be.” I said, “Well, if you were truly honest, you wouldn’t need to try to be.” (He was as crooked as a dog’s hind leg). My all-time favourite attorney-routine is the asking of two questions for the price of one. “Did you or did you not ... ?” An attorney once asked me one of these double-edged questions and so I asked, “What is it you want to know?” He repeated the question so I answered, “Which question do you want answered?” He repeated it again, so I said, “no to the first question; yes to the second.” Not only didn’t he understand my answer, but also he didn’t understand his own question. If I had answered just “yes”, how could he know to which part I was referring? “Yes, I did not ...”? or “Yes, I did ... ”? As idiotic as it is, attorneys still use this inane manner of questioning. They must think it sounds daunting, when in fact it only makes them sound as if they don’t know what they’re talking about, which in most cases is true. But this stunt also allows them to twist any answer to suit their case. Don’t fall for it. Always answer with either “I did” or “I did not” ....... in fact, skip the court altogether - there is nothing requiring you to go in the first place. Whom did the court ‘invite’? You? I don’t think so. All you have to do is RSVP. An invitation to court is tantamount to an invitation to a Charles Manson party. Don’t go; graciously decline. Licensure A licence is “a permit to do some activity which would otherwise be illegal”. A licence is the authority to act on something which in its nature is lawful but prohibited by statutes except with permission of authority. This activity is now a privilege and can be revoked, leading to no liberty - ‘liberty’ being defined as: ‘freedom and exemption from extraneous control’. Take a look at all the activities for which most people have been conned to believe we are required to have licences: marriage, building, driver, firearms, business, professional, trade, BAR ticket, hunting, etc. which tells us that without these permits, the following activities are illegal: creating a home and family with someone you love, adding a room onto your house, traveling to a friend’s house in your personally-owned automobile, protecting your family from intruders, ‘earning your living’ from your privately-owned business, taking care of infirmed fellow living souls, fixing someone’s plumbing/electricity, going into a court of law (apart from the fact they no longer exist - they are now courts of commerce) about a matter between you and a colleague, shoot your food in 44"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"the wilderness, etc. etc. The list goes on. Why would a free man or woman require permission from the government to get married, drive a car, start a business, add onto one’s home, or improve one’s property? We are no longer free to do anything because statutes have been enacted requiring us to get permits in order to do some activity which does not infringe upon the life, liberty, property, or rights of another. Its all about control. The Catch 22 of this is that you’re damned if you don’t have a licence because you will get fined for not having one, and damned if you do because you will get fined for doing something which the permit does not allow. Either way one is asking for control. Personally, I take a chance on not having the licence. I have NO licences. I have given up all of them. I do have a ‘driver permit’ which I created for the purpose of facility - something to show the cops to pacify them as opposed to telling them “I don’t have a driver’s licence”, which I did years ago and only created problems as opposed to accomplishing what I intended. Yet, what I carry is not government-issued, it is self-issued. Those of us with self-issued ‘licences’ not only claim our rights in a responsible and organized way as a peaceful transitional declaratory offering for gov’t observance but also it introduces the concept of liberty to others. The problem is the contract. If we don’t have a contract with the ‘authority’, they have no authority over us. Alleged ‘authorities’ do everything in their power to intimidate us into getting these permits, such as telling us it is law, etc. when in fact they cannot make anyone get a licence for anything since this would be forced contracting, the very nature of which would make it invalid. Not only do we have unlimited right to contract but also unlimited right not to contract. So, since I graduated from a school which gave me a diploma stating that I obviously knew enough about nursing in order to get a job doing this, why do I need a licence to do it? Have you ever noticed that in obtaining a driver licence, the two things they most want from you is a signature and an address? They couldn’t give a damn if you know what to do with the car, they want to get your signature on this fraudulent contract and also know where they can find you if you do something they don’t like and they can come and get you and/or your car. Never put on any contract the location of where you sleep at night and never carry any ‘ID’ with an ‘address’ on it. I carry a very out-dated (15 years) passport because its picture of me is great. Actually, it is great ID because it has no ‘address’. One time a cop asked me for ID. I asked him if I were required to have ID. Sensing I could be causing trouble, I pulled out some “ID” and said, “Well, I do have ID but the info on it is only hearsay; I don’t know if its true, so how would you know? Is hearsay admissible in court?” That was the end of that. Never sign any contract unless you are given full disclosure and understand every term of the contract. Never agree to any terms and conditions which you know won’t work for you. This is the purpose and meaning of a contract - something to which both parties can agree to be bound without compunction - a meeting of the minds. So, feel free to line-out and be sure to initial what you don’t like. Then , in the place for ‘signature’, write, “By: (your autograph), agent”, as you are agent to the strawman, no doubt to which the contract applies. Once ‘signed’ it cannot be changed. As ‘acceptor’ or ‘rejector’, you are in control. Make it work for you. You can include, “without prejudice” or “All Rights Reserved”, or UCC1-207, which will protect your right not to be compelled to perform under any contract or commercial agreement that you did not enter knowingly, voluntarily, and intentionally , yet I recommend ‘agent’ or ‘authorized representative’ after your signature, which means that you, the living soul, are not the entity to whom the alleged contract applies. The word ‘By:’ right before your autograph is the best because it evidences your agency. Licences control, regulate, stifle, intimidate, rob, and destroy. Licensure is presented under the guise of protectionism. Governments license in order to make work for secretaries, boards, bureaucrats, and commissions whose function it is to assure government an additional source of revenue from the price of granting its permission. Tyrannical governments prefer that their subjects/ slaves be required to ask for their permission prior to, and as a condition of, doing nearly every kind of independent, public, or private activity. Such governments want servile subjects who do what they are told to do. So, entire administrations are created to promote the acceptance of licensing as ‘for the common good’ or ‘for public protection’. Protect me from the Protectors. - Don Croft Governments need armies to protect them from their enslaved and oppressed subjects. - Tolstoy Gov’t licensing is all about the difference between a ‘right’ and a ‘privilege’. A ‘free’ individual has the right to do anything as long as in doing so no threat or harm is done to the life, liberty, property. or rights of another. However, one must request permission to do something which transgresses the rights or 45"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"property of another, in which case only the one owning the right or property has the authority to grant the permission. As the government has no rights to give - it has only duties and limitations - and it has no authority to collect any revenues other than duties, impost, and excise taxes. Gov’t has no authority to profit financially from licensing. “Everyone knows” The only way that ‘everyone’ could ‘know’ anything is if someone had a vested interest in making sure that ‘everyone’ ‘knows’ something. In every case of ‘everyone knows’ is one who stands to benefit by what ‘everyone knows’; hence it can not possibly be a truth since all ‘truths’ seem to be known by very few because all truth can be known only intuitively and/or experientially. I don’t know of anything that ‘everyone knows’ which is true, do you? The only reason that ‘everyone knows’ anything is because they’ve been propagandized into allegedly ‘knowing’ - the public fool system being the best perpetrator of this fraud. How is it that an entire continent can know when to set clocks ahead and back, yet very few know that when we are upset it is never for the reason we think. Did someone forget to put that on the front page of the newspaper? So, if everyone knows something - anything, you can count on there being one with something to gain from our ‘knowing’ it. You can also count on its being untrue. Therefore, ‘everyone knows you have to pay income tax, get a driver’s licence, get a good education’, etc. - none of which is true. “Everyone Knows” You Have to Go to Court When You are Summonsed Never go to court. The court is only a third party debt collector for a foreign corporation. You are never named on any summons. Even that which you consider to be your name is not you; it only represents you. You are not a party to the action. You cannot be charged because no fiction (any public entity) can bring any claim against a living soul. So, when you are served a summons, check to see if your name is on it. It can’t be. The exception is, of course, if the Plaintiff is another living soul and is bringing you into court because you truly have injured him by breaking the one law, which he will have to prove. When you go into court, you are putting your fate into the hands of 12 people who weren’t smart enough to get out of jury duty. - Norm Crosby Since the courts get more mileage/ kilometrage from our thinking that the Constitution/ Charter of Rights and Freedoms is the law which the courts are bound to use and wasting our time citing it, they really don't want us to know that it doesn’t apply. Actually, this is good news, better news, and best news since relying upon these documents for legal argument just makes judges rule against us. These documents apply to sovereign entities, however, if you find yourself in court it is because you have relinquished your sovereignty or you wouldn’t be there. So, in fact, if you are in court these documents do not apply to you. The supreme law of the land is contract law and falls under the UCC. The significance of Erie vs. Thompkins case decision of 1938 is that no cases prior to 1938 are allowed to be cited. There can be no mixing of the old law with the new law. All lawyers are members of the BAR and controlled by the Lawyer's Guild of Great Britain. They created, formed, and implemented the new bankruptcy law and are sworn to uphold the bankruptcy. We can never know the true ‘nature and cause of the accusation’ because it is ..... the collection of interest on the bankruptcy. We are denied our right to challenge the creditor/ banker because if we could ‘face our accuser’ we could ask about our indebtedness and this would blow their cover. They would have to provide us with the contract proving we knowingly, voluntarily, and willingly agreed to pay the corporate public debt which, of course, we did not do. The PTB have apprised the government/ attorneys of the laws/ statutes under which this system works. We have moved from real law to statutes made up by the attorneys for the sole purpose of collecting revenue and property. You assist an evil system most effectively by obeying its orders and decrees. An evil system never deserves such allegiance. Allegiance to it means partaking of the evil. A good person will resist an evil system with his or her whole soul. - Mahatma Gandhi Read the ‘law’ and you will see that it suggests a circumstance which works for one and all. Read any statute and you will see that it compels one to a particular performance, which implies yet never states, if not performed, a fine is imposed. There is no mention of fines in any statute, code, rule, or regulation. Where is 46"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"the implementing regulation? They all just state what we are all supposed to do. The reason most have not squawked too much about these statutes is that they believe they are getting some privilege which compensates for the occasional fine, and yet just the opposite is true . A neighbour told me years ago that she was all for everyone getting Social Security Numbers. “If they can catch just one ‘dead-beat dad’, then it is worth it.” This is what she was led to believe. If you ask the wives of these ‘dead-beat dads’, you’ll discover that the pittance the feds give her, after ordering dad’s boss to garnish his wages, is taxable and she will be worse off than before, particularly if she has paid an attorney to bring dad into court in order to get the order. It is never worth it. Again, it is win/ win for the feds and lose/ lose for both parents. If only parents could to sit down and negotiate, they, along with their children, would all win. Involving the state means you lose all control. Just so you know that there is a light at the end of the tunnel - and it is not the light of an oncoming train - here is an encouraging story. In her book, Energy Medicine , Donna Eden tells of having taught a class wherein one of the attendees was a judge. Imagine a judge being so enlightened as to go to a class on ‘energy medicine’. A few months later he contacted her and related a case he had before him. A man had beaten his wife and the neighbour who had attempted to intervene. The children were aghast and everyone was stunned because this man was a true family man and good neighbour; he just went berserk one evening. The judge asked Donna Eden, “Just before I pass sentence on this fellow I wonder if this might be a case of that ‘triple-warmer’ thing we learned about in your class” - a meridian line of energy which when blocked causes chaos. Donna thought so from the description of the man’s behaviour. The judge sentenced the man to a dozen of Donna Eden’s Energy Medicine classes. So, you see, we are making our way into the light. Is this a judge we want our fellows and/or ourselves to face? You bet! Courts kangaroo court. 1. A self appointed tribunal or mock court in which the principles of law and justice are disregarded, perverted or parodied. 2. A court or tribunal characterized by authorized or irregular procedures, esp. so as to render a fair proceeding impossible. 3. A sham legal proceeding .

Unfortunately, the living soul thinks he is the Defendant. Everyone who is in jail is there because of something he said, or failed to say, prior to, or during, an administrative tribunal, not for some ‘wrong’ deed. * In an equity court, which is all there is since there are no more courts ‘of law’, when we are asked, “Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God?”, we must respond “No” - not to be contemptuous but rather because the ‘truth’ can not be told. Courts of equity can neither see nor hear ‘truth’. They are courts of fiction and cannot have any truth within. If indeed one tells the ‘whole truth’, the cat will be let out of the bag and he will thereby be in contempt and go directly to jail. We must tell ‘our’ truth, which is that we accepted and returned their offer, (more later), yet telling ‘the’ truth will land us in jail very quickly. Remember that Martha Stewart got herself into trouble not by having anything to do with ‘insider trading’ but by lying. Since there is no law against ‘lying’, the only way she could be convicted was for her to have made it a crime to lie. The only way that she could have made ‘lying’ a crime is by contracting and agreeing not to lie. The only way she could contract and agree to that was to ‘swear to tell the truth’ - it was her swearing in that created the contract which she later breached by lying - which convicted her. Had she never agreed /contracted to ‘tell the truth’, she never would have been convicted. Her conviction had nothing to do with ‘insider trading’ OR ‘lying’; it had everything to do with contracting . A game warden caught a man with furs in the trunk of his car. Every time the warden, and ultimately the judge, asked about the furs, the man responded with, “What furs?” Even when the furs were pointed out to him he asked, “What furs?” The had to let him go because he never contracted. Contracts I am not making this up; the courts literally trick us into contracting with them in order for us to slit our own throats by breaching the terms and conditions of the contract. This is WHY we are asked if we will ‘swear’. We have an option; we are not required to tell the truth unless we swear we will - i.e.: enter into a contract with someone and agree to tell the truth. The sole purpose of that question is to get us to contract. They have NO jurisdiction until we contract. As long as we do not contract with them - and no law can compel anyone to contract - we can remain free. We have the right to contract and .... the right not to contract. All they do is go along with us. They have no commercial energy of their own - they rely on us to 49"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"give it to them. “All law is commerce; all commerce is contract; no contract - no case”. The following “Toothpick Story” illustrates this concept. A fellow went to court and had managed not to contract right to the end when he said, “It seems my public business is finished here so I am now leaving”, and headed to the door. The judge yelled, “And take that toothpick out of your mouth!” and the man did. As soon as he did, the judge yelled to the Bailiff, “Arrest that man.” Why? Because by removing the toothpick from his mouth the man had contracted with the court. All Law is Contract; Every Interchange Between People is Contract; All Commerce is Contract. Contract Makes the Law Remember, anything that requires your signature, or a swearing thereto in order to give it application, is not law, but a contract. - Ron Branson (J.A.I.L. - Judicial Accountability Initiative Law) At common law, these eight elements are essential to the creation of a contract: offer, acceptance, intention, sufficient and equal consideration, mental and lawful capacity to contract, legality of purpose, genuine consent (knowingly, willingly, and voluntarily), certainty of terms and conditions. You are usually tricked into contracting. I heard of a woman who was charged with writing ‘bad cheques’ and prior to sentencing was asked by the judge if she had anything to say. This is called, ‘allocution’ and is the time for the ‘defendant’ to say what’s so. Unfortunately, most defendants fail to take advantage of this opportunity to set the record straight. She, however, told the judge, “With all due respect, I do not accept your sentence.” The judge then said, “I sentence you to 25 years.” Again she said, “I do not accept your sentence.” He called both attorneys, who were now visibly irate, to come forward. The judge then asked, “Well, Ms. ... , would you think it kind of the court to sentence you to only 10 years?” Again she said she would not accept his sentence. The judge's final words, to the dismay of the attorneys were, “I hereby dismiss this case and all charges are dropped.” He couldn’t do anything without her agreement. This is the power of contracts. By the way, it is impossible to write a ‘bad cheque’; there is no such thing. If it has a date, a payee, a $$$ amount, and an autograph it is a lawful commercial instrument because the funds are created by those four requirements. If it is kept by the corporate entity to which one has specified ‘credit/pay to the order of’, then it is clearly being used as such. Don’t let anyone tell you that you wrote a ‘bad cheque’. Sure, there might not have been debt funds in the account to cover it yet that doesn’t mean that the private side hasn’t been accessed. In fact, you can be certain that it has been if it weren’t returned to you and if it has been returned then keep in mind that a debt/ legal tender (payment) offered in honour (in good faith) and refused, is a debt discharged. There is no commercial crime here except on the part of the entity trying to charge you with ‘writing a bad cheque.’ Remember: A Promissory Note is a Promissory Note is a Promissory Note....... more later when I recount my latest adventures with RBC (Royal Bank of Canada) and CRA (which continues to change its name - so just remember it as the Canadian version of IRS). An offer of contract becomes binding after 72 hours (3 days); after seven (7) days there is a default and after ten (10) days there is a summary judgement. So handle your offers immediately. The basis of 99% of all legal actions is derived from a ‘person’ (strawman) being sued, or accused of having entered into and breached a commercial contract, or being presumed to have entered into and breached a commercial contract. If the contract does not meet the four legal requirements, it is void. In order to live free we must remain eternally vigilant of these invisible contracts and avoid the presumption of their existence. The most significant presumptions are: 1. that you are a resident; 2. that you depend upon the government for benefits; 3. that you are not responsible for your behaviour; and 4. that you need protection - an attorney, a financial advisor, a doctor, a fiat currency, etc. (Protect me from the protectors.) All the above are false presumptions, the existence of which is perpetuated upon the belief that all land and people are collateral for a debt which supports a fraudulent monetary system. All are based upon the presumption that certificates of ‘birth’/‘title’, etc., in commercial law, waive our right to take responsibility for our own affairs and own our bodies, plus life, liberty, and the property we accumulate through trading our labour with others or creating from raw materials, if we don’t object to or arrange our affairs otherwise. The PTB have established a long history (hundreds of years) of lending what is considered ‘money’ or ‘credit’ and then calling in debts, and creating wars around the world over these debts. 50"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Believe it or Not! 1.

USA: 27 CFR 72.11- code of federal regulations defines Commercial Crimes as any of the following types of crimes (Federal or State): “Offenses against the revenue laws; burglary; forgery; counterfeiting; kidnapping; larceny; robbery; illegal sale or possession of deadly weapons; prostitution (including soliciting, procuring, pandering, white slaving, keeping house of ill fame, and like offenses); extortion; swindling and confidence games; and attempting to commit, conspiring to commit, or compounding any of the foregoing crimes.

Peter McWilliams wrote, Ain’t No Crime If You Do about victimless crimes. “If there is no injured party, no deposable witness, no filed sworn complaint, how is it that the government gets away with charging you with a crime?” It cannot even be said that the State has ever shown any disposition to suppress crime, but only to safeguard its own monopoly of crime. - Albert Jay Nock 51"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Extortion How to handle a bully: 1. pay him; 2. obtain third party intervention; 3. learn his rules and beat him at his own game; 4. remove yourself None of these heals the cause, yet sometimes the cause can’t be healed and treating the symptoms will only encourage the bully.

Corporations and Corporate Entities Corporations are for unlawful purposes, primarily to escape punishment for their crimes by placing the blame on a fictional organization responsible to no one. Their sole purpose is to shirk responsibility . One who incorporates or even those who join a corporation are doing it for the purpose of avoiding personal responsibility for their own lives. I realize this sounds harsh, yet take a look at the results for the evidence. When corporations are established with the power to declare themselves ‘bankrupt’ that makes them criminal. This is the situation of governments today. Corporations are legal fictions; that is, they do not exist except in the minds of men. A corporation, being a legal fiction, cannot think, it cannot act in any manner, it cannot even communicate with natural man, and for this reason it must have somebody to speak and act for it, and the lawyers have set themselves up for this task. The enormity of corporate enterprises is limited only by imagination and they are gold mines for the bar associations, which are corporations themselves. Only 6% of all corporations pay any tax whatsoever and the rest they get by taking our exemptions - think Enron - or passing their tax liability onto us, e.g.: in the form of sales tax/GST . Remember, living souls are not required to pay any tax whatsoever. Powaquatsi (Powaq quatsi): life in transformation; a way of life or an entity which consumes the life forces of other entities in order to further its own life; e.g.: a corporation Yet, the most common and insidious corporation by far is the one for which you are personally being held as surety. You have been tricked into this by the gov’t which created this corporation. Since all corporations are gov’t-created, we can surmise that the sole purpose of all corporations is to generate revenue for the World Bank. The corporation for which you are being held as surety is the one whose name resembles yours. If you’ve ever worked for a major corporation, you’ve heard the constant lament about trying to save money for the corporation. Well, there is no money, and there is no corporation. So whatever they’re doing, they’re doing for entities which don’t exist, and at the expense of living souls. The real problem is that real living souls truly think that the corporation needs to save money and of course this is based upon the fear that if it meets its demise, through loss of some kind or another, then so will they. What corporate people need to do is walk away and privately contract out their talents. The wins to this are: no taxes withheld, SS/CP becomes optional, reduced tax (if you choose to file and use business deductions), control over time, etc. The benefits are endless. When the gov’t sends you a bill for taxes due and owing, you can’t ‘pay’ it yet you can discharge it. A friend used to work for Rand Corporation. As soon as he quit they hired him as a consultant; his income doubled and his taxes were reduced to a third. I always worked for agencies rather than hospitals because I was paid about 25% more by remaining somewhat independent. I’d ask the nurses on the ward why they didn’t do the same. “I want the benefits.” I told them that with what I earned I could easily afford to handle any ‘emergency’ which might come up, and which probably wouldn’t, yet they are working 40 hours a week for peanuts in anticipation of their need for surgery. These were young women. Talk about “getting yourself with a good company.” They were enslaved. The longer they were there, the longer they would have to stay - in order to collect whatever they thought they might get when it was all over. I know people who can consciously say, “I can’t leave; I’ll lose all my benefits.” YIKES! They don’t see that there is NO benefit in staying. I’ll say it again, there’ll be no pensions when its time for my generation to collect - 10 years from now. Yet, this is good, better, and best news. More, later. A corporation is an artificial, immortal individual. For an organization, e.g.: a church, seeking recognition of tax exemption under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (and who knows what, in CRA), in order to be an ‘organization’ in the legal sense, it is necessary to incorporate. As soon as it 52"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"incorporates it becomes a commercial entity and applies for and obtains an IRS 501(c)(3) status ruling (remaining non-political and non controversial) and it retains its tax exempt status. Essentially, the state then runs the church. If you think your pastor/ rabbi/ priest/ minister can speak his mind, think again. Yet, churches are automatically exempt from Federal Income Tax. Contributions to churches are deductible by donors so why would a church apply for gov’t stamp of approval when it was already free? A church that is tax exempt is not a ‘tax exempt church’ but a religious organization which applies for corporate status thereby going from ‘lawful assembly of private citizens’ to that of a ‘legal gathering of public subjects’. Religion is for people who are frightened of going to Hell; Spiritualism is for those who have already been there. - Gary Busey “God never gives us more that we can handle.” I want whoever said that to have a chat with those desperate enough to have committed suicide. The church teaches that thinking of extramarital sex (yet not doing it) is the same as doing it; however, thinking about putting money into the collection plate (yet not doing it) is not the same as doing it. - Red Pritchard, 1973 There is nothing to fear about the imminent collapse of the global financial prison. - David Icke Model Emergency Health Powers Act Needless to say, this has nothing to do with health; it has to do with gov’t control. Remember who owns your body, unless you have taken steps to secure it. Under this act: 1. you will have a mandatory vaccination or you will be charged with a crime 2. you will get a mandatory medical exam or you will be charged with a crime 3. doctors will give the exam or you will be charged with a crime 4. your property can be seized if there is “Reasonable Cause to Believe” that it may pose a public health hazard... it can be burned or destroyed and you will NOT have recourse or compensation. This sort of thing is flying around the Internet and although I have no doubt that it is accurate, whoever wrote it sees this as attack as opposed to desperation on the part of those charged with collecting the interest on the loan. The only reason things are getting more and more threatening for us and our alleged ‘possessions’ is because the powers-that-be are under the gun to “collect, ... or else.” Remember, the gov’t and all its branches are solely revenue-collecting agencies. If you have private, legal title to your property, there is no way it can be confiscated; your property includes your body. When they issue warrants for bodies to come in and get vaccinated, remember they are referring to the bodies to which they have legal title and to which you have only equitable title. If you already have legal title to your body, you can provide the papers proving this. I am grateful that I knew, a decade in advance of my birthing my boys, that vaccines are killers and so neither of my boys is vaccinated - or circumcised - and of all the diseases deemed “normal childhood diseases” they caught only chicken pox. National Debt The interest on fraudulent bonds also has to be created by more borrowing. The money supply has to be constantly expanded because the interest has to be paid. Interest on the bonds (national debt) is paid before any other gov’t expense. If not, the entire system will collapse. The debt can’t be reduced because when funds are paid to reduce the debt (buy back the bonds and retire them) the money disappears from circulation since it returns to from whence it came - nowhere. When there is no money, there is depression; the standard of living drops which is why there is no middle class any longer. This is why the debt must be ‘discharged’ as opposed to being ‘paid’, because it CAN NOT BE PAID. You might be interested in Jim Trafficant’s speech on The Bankruptcy of the United States. Look it up - he tells the entire story, which is why he is in jail - but the feds won’t admit to that.

Remedy There must be a remedy. Since we are operating in commerce, the remedy must be found in the Uniform Commercial Code. Remember: 1. signing the application for a licence is voluntary. You have the right to do these normal activities without such applications; 2. the applications are for ‘benefits’, ‘privileges’, and ‘opportunities’, which justify denial of your Creator-given rights with which you were born, but which were transferred upon birth registration; 3. we cannot acquire ‘true’ or ‘allodial title’ to any property purchased with such applications. We must ‘buy’ property in order to obtain ‘legal title’. This can be done only by exchanging your exemption for title . You can not own property by paying for it; 4. we cannot pay our debts at law; we can only discharge our debts in equity. Advantages of filing a UCC / PPSA Filing a PPSA/UCC-1 is rather like the husband putting an ad in the local newspaper (usually the case and not the other way around) stating he is no longer responsible for his wife’s debts. This reminds me of the husband who didn’t report his wife’s credit card as stolen because the thief was spending less than she had been spending. So, the filing is stating something similar. When completing a UCC/PPSA Financing Statement (FS) keep in mind that the Secured Party (SP) must be a fiction/Strawman because only fictions can function in commerce. So the SP claims the Strawman Debtor (SD). Then the SD signs over to the SP, for which you, the living soul, are the agent, everything it owns via a private contract called a Security Agreement (SA). Do not file the SA, only reference its number under General Collateral on the FS. The SA gives you, the agent for the SP, a superior claim over the SD thereby removing you as Surety for the Strawman. The only way you can rebut their presumption that you are surety is to notice them with the FS; yet you cannot operate in commerce so the strawman operates for you and files the FS. So, it is the SP which files the claim against the SD. Now, any charge against the SD can be discharged by you, the third party of interest, who now has a superior claim over all rights, titles, and interests of the Strawman. The problem the registries have in filing these claims is that the SD and SP appear to be the same entity since both are in upper case. So, be creative: come up with different spellings, or women can use a maiden name claiming the married name, or list minor children first in order to distract them from noticing that the SP is also listed amongst the Debtors. If they reject the filing do as I did: I woke up and remembered who I am. Since they are my servants, I realized that all I had to do is ‘Notice’ them that the document is registered with Canada Post. I am first in line, first in time. My records show they received it - rather the same as my car - it is not ‘registered’; it is ‘recorded’. We are to Notice, not request, our public servants to do our bidding. The Financing Statement is the one contract in the world which can not be broken. Since we have unlimited credit with the Fed we can access it through an account. Remember there is no money so it is not as if you can mosy over to the FRB/ BC and get cash. This is for the discharge of public debt only. We are intending to remove ourselves from needing cash so you don’t want to add to the problem by accumulating more. We now control the funds so that the Feds will move figures, entries, and digits for our benefit - no longer for their benefit. By properly filing a FS we can become the holder in due course of the Strawman. When we are charged, we can simply discharge the charge with our tax exemption. This is commerce - not law. None of the charade. We simply accept the charge for value and return it for discharge, settlement, and closure. Since the claim is pre-paid and our account at the Fed is exempt from levy, the alleged debt goes away - sort of - at least until we have something with which to pay it. Since any control, which any alleged authority has over you, comes from your giving it, I suggest you never inadvertently grant jurisdiction to any court or any public entity. Remember who you are . A ‘judge’ once asked me if I understood the charge (traffic). I told him we couldn’t proceed until he proved he had jurisdiction over me (I knew he had jurisdiction over the Strawman as I had yet to file my UCC 1). He just sat there stunned. Silence. Once we file a Financing Statement we can ‘discharge’ any public claim presented to us. If we ‘honour’ the claim by accepting it, we can discharge it. If we ‘dishonour’ the claim (by resisting, fighting, 54"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"ignoring, arguing) we create a controversy which must be taken into court for resolution. ‘Accepting’ doesn’t mean acquiescing; it means we now control the offer. E.g.: If you have paid the bank $10,000 on a vehicle you think you own and you get behind in the payments, the bank can take the car away from you because you don’t own it. If you show on a Financing Statement that you have invested $10,000 into the vehicle and then got behind in payments, the bank would have to pay you the $10,000 before they take it. The UCC in article 3, § 505 lists the rights of a party presented with a demand for payment, no matter who the alleged claimant, e.g.: IRS/CRA, or what the claim, e.g.: property tax/income tax. No one can ever show a liability on your part, only a demand for $$$. This is how I have so much fun with the alleged creditors. They continue to send me statements; I continue to demand an invoice, signed under their full, commercial liability and I’ll be happy to settle the accounting, but they never do! To do so would be committing fraud. How can I pay a bill if they won’t send me one? The Powers-That-Be - the Global Elite The top 1% of the world has the same combined income as the bottom 57%, and the disparity is growing. At the top of the decision-making pyramid we have the Ruling Elite. They utilize psychopolitics deliberately to influence all nine steps in the decision-making process. They control every step by: 1. Creating events and predetermining their outcome; 2. Manufacturing event details and controlling the information dissemination infrastructure; 3. Biasing the alarm faculties of common people by the selected dissemination of controlled information; 4. Molding knowledge and belief systems through ‘education’; 5. Intentionally providing the children of common people with inferior education through public instruction while Ruling Elite children attend premier schools and colleges; 6. Controlling the emotions of common people through social rhetoric and religious dogma; 7. Enacting rules and regulations that influence common peoples’ decisions based upon expected rewards and feared punishments; 8. Intimidating the decisions of ordinary people by enforcing codes, rules, and regulations with coercion, the threat of force, torture, fines, or imprisonment; and, 9. Erecting surveillance networks which have the ability to monitor the behaviors and actions of groups and individuals. Investments We will see neither our retirement investments nor our pensions. Do not get plugged in; this is good news. It means the economic structure under which we have been living is about to collapse, and about bloody time. Yes, there will be some casualties, but for the most part, it will wake us up to know that there is no security outside ourselves. A few years ago I took the advice of a friend who was encouraging me to get into the commodities market and buy ‘March coffee’. At every turn I was stymied. I could not get anything to go the way I wanted. With each passing week, the window of opportunity narrowed and my final exasperation came when the fax machine wouldn’t fax the order. I finally said, “Someone doesn’t want me to buy this trade.” I emailed my broker complaining that everything was holding me up: Christmas holidays, bankers, wrong telephone numbers, faxes, inability to get hold of my friend to ask for the stop date, etc. He wrote back and said, “Patience, my dear. If you had bought when you intended, you’d be down $2500”. I knew this wasn’t possible since the worst I could have done was a loss of $1400; nevertheless I went to the trade website and saw that had I bought March coffee, I’d have been out of the market for a nickel and lost my investment. I laughed so hard I couldn’t stand up. Unfortunately, my friend, who had bought while I was horsing around not knowing what I was doing, lost a chunk of funds. This was my final lesson in ‘there are no investments’, well, there are investments, but there are no returns of substance. The investment game is one which is run by the elite to get our funds. We can’t possibly win. Its like going to Las Vegas. If you’re going for any reason other than entertainment, you’re putting your faith into something that doesn’t exist. I’m willing to concede that many have made the proverbial killing in the market, yet they fail to see that what they have gained is a liability. Even more 55"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"important is they haven’t yet met the living soul who lost in order for them to win. I finally learned that I don’t have to become financially secure; I must forgive myself for thinking that I ought to become so - particularly because it is an impossibility. Sixty per cent (60%) of the stock market is the investments of the CAFR (Comprehensive Annual Financial Report) accounts of cities. This is where your funds from traffic tickets, property taxes, etc. go - to fund the gambling of the city officials. They are investing with our funds and winning; then they hide it in a CAFR account and then cry that they don’t have enough $$$ to pay for emergency services - firemen, paramedics, etc. A woman I know is quite panicky about her future and states, “Well, at least I have my company pension when I’m 65.” I laugh (almost as hard as when I’m told I ought to be saving for my children’s college education. That’s 3 years from now and the economy will be so vastly changed by then, it will be unrecognizable, not to mention that I don’t want my children programmed any more than they already are via ‘higher education’). So, where does my friend think she’s going to find this corporation which will have already absconded with her alleged pension? It is a fiction; it doesn’t exist; nor does its alleged assets. Four (4!) people have said to me, “My pension is ‘locked in’.” Chortle. The reason we have the corporate scams (like Enron) these days is because of bad bookkeeping. This is their only crime. There are no funds to steal; what they have stolen is the exemption of their (former) employees. Even after you leave the job the corporation continues to use your exemption because they have your SSN/SIN. The real question is, why haven’t the employees themselves been using their exemptions and not leave them lying around for the crooked corporations to steal? Bush’s ostensible upset about cracking down on corporate greed (what a skit!) is not to punish them but to remind them to clean up their act before the sheeple catch on that they’re cooking the books. Since there is no money it is only credit/ assets which they’re stealing by juggling the liability side of the accounts which they can do because the people have turned over their exemptions to them. The cat is out of the bag. These corporations are in for a big surprise. Civil Liberties Today, America would be outraged if U.N. troops entered Los Angeles to restore order [referring to the 1991 LA Riot]. Tomorrow they will be grateful! This is especially true if they were told that there were an outside threat from beyond [i.e., an \" extraterrestrial\" invasion], whether real or promulgated, that threatened our very existence. It is then that all peoples of the world will plead to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by the World Government. - Dr. Henry Kissinger, Bilderberger Conference, Evians, France, 1991 Bush is in place for only one purpose: to get the American people to give up the last of their few remaining rights.

There is NO American Government and hasn’t been in scores of years. To what they refer is USG, the belligerent, foreign corporation masquerading as ‘the American Government ’ . It has named itself The Government of the United States of America for the sole purpose of conning the American people into believing that it represents them and that it is its government. The USG, a private, fictitious, for-profit corporation, has no more to do with the American people or the American territory than does SEARS, another private, fictitious, for-profit corporation. ‘Americans’, which includes those of us in Canada, have long been subjected to the terrorism of the corporations USG and Government of Canada. No one alive today has experienced a representative government which brings us to another point: why would anyone vote in a foreign election for a foreign corporation? There is no one for whom to vote who could possibly represent us. Our country has been under siege for so long I wonder if we will ever get it back. Gouvernement - Canada The Constitution and Charter of Rights and Freedoms does not apply to Canadians. Remember the four elements of a valid legal contract: 1) full disclosure, 2) equal consideration, 3) lawful terms and conditions, 4) signatures of all parties. Is your signature on it? No, you are not a party to it. Since CANADA is a corporation, the Charter is precisely that - a charter for a LLC (limited liability corporation) not a contract involving you because corporations can’t contract; only living souls can contract. The Constitution is a body of law, written by the state, in order to control the government. The CAG is controlled by a belligerent, foreign, fictional corporation called the Anglican Church, and known as the British Crown. ‘Their’ Constitution does not apply to the people of the land mass known as Canada. It applies, just as every other code, rule, regulation, ordinance, and statute applies, only to the Crown’s employees - namely the federal and provincial governments and all their employees - and to anyone who chooses to volunteer. See ‘application of charter’ in Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 32. (1)This Charter applies: a) to the Parliament and government of Canada in respect of all matters within the authority of Parliament including all matters relating to the Yukon Territory and Northwest Territories; and b) to the legislature and government of each province in respect of all matters within the authority of the legislature of each province. As none of us signed this contract it doesn’t apply to us. Our ‘charter rights’ are violated with impunity by the privately-owned Anglican Church legal system franchise known as the BAR Association via the Vatican and British Crown. There is a difference between the CAG and the USG: the feds in Canada not only call themselves ‘civil servants’ but also believe, maybe, they truly are the servants of the people and hence it is easier for them to understand that the Canadian people truly are sovereign - maybe. Even though Americans are more inherently sovereign than Canadians, the feds in the US are nowhere near as likely to admit it. Government - America There were only 4 purposes of government: 1) to provide a military to protect the American Republics; 2) to monitor commerce/trade among the Republics; 3) to maintain the overall welfare for ALL (not just certain groups or individuals); 4) to govern international commerce of the union. The Bill of Rights dictates the limitations of government. The people of the united States of America never had ‘Constitutional Rights’, they had a government with limitations in order to preserve their ‘natural’ rights. Alas, no more.

Communism: gov’t owns and controls ALL productivity; Since the name on the deed for your house is a government-created NAME, the government owns your house. You’ll notice that this set-up falls into the last definition: Communism The sole objective of the Global Elite is to create an Economic Slave Force - “an economic system owned by the workers and controlled by the state, economic growth and planning controlled by a central authority, corporations and their stocks regulated by the gov’t, private FRB controlling interest rates and income tax, and political control by an authoritative party” - FDR. They must distract the people with inane subjects, like sports, politics (thinking there is any difference among party leaders), via TV, so that they don’t notice what’s really going on. The first plank of the communist manifesto is: abolition of private property. The agenda of the Global Elite is to steal land, control families, education, religion, implement a central private bank, promote immoral behaviour, and eliminate countries and nationalities. DONE! The real rulers in Washington are invisible and exercise power from behind the scenes . - Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, 1952 I am concerned for the security of our great nation, not so much because of any threat from without, but because of the insidious forces working from within. — General Douglas MacArthur Communism the 10 Planks of the Communist Manifesto 1.

His servitude is strictly objective. - Aldous Huxley - Brave New World Revisited, 1958 The problem with knowledge is that there is no going back - like taking the Red Pill in the Matrix. Do I want to exchange my freedom for an easier life as a good slave? Our freedom will ultimately depend upon whether we contract away our rights or remain aware of the nature of benefits implying the existence of a contract, and by our failing to object to the presumption of a contract. ‘Freedom’ is not the easiest road - yet we may be more satisfied with ourselves for having taken it. Your ability to ‘choose’ is what constitutes your freedom. If we were ever to live in harmony, politicians and bureaucrats would have to confine their lives to minding their own business and deriving what benefit they could from those who chose to co-operate with them.

One of the symptoms of an approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that one’s work is terribly important. - Bertrand Russell Commerce is a game only the banksters can win. They have programmed us to believe that the more money we have the better life can be - so now men work two jobs and every woman under 50 thinks she ought to be ‘working’. I never intended to work; I never fell for the ‘women want a career’ nonsense. I’ve never met a woman who isn’t angry and I contend this is why. Many women went into the work force believing they could change the world, that the world would be a more pleasant place to be if there were less testosterone in the powerful positions. Unfortunately, the women who rose to those positions became men. They donned the three-piece suits and in fact made the problem worse. The only thing worse than men running the world is women who think they are men running the world. What women want is a safer and happier world for their children to grow up, yet the result was they were conned into spending their days away from their children. On the last day I worked as an RN I got into my car and heard , “you will no longer slave-labour for the genocidal pharmaceutical industry and medical mafia”. I had long felt unethical about poisoning the old folks so this was perfect. It crossed my mind that I still had two work days scheduled so I intended to keep my commitment, however, as it turned out, through nothing I did or did not, that day was indeed my last. I had allowed my RN ‘licence’ to lapse. I refused to submit any longer to extortion - “obtaining money by compulsion or threat”(Oxford English Dictionary) - or to a licence - “permission to do that which is otherwise prohibited”. (OED) AARN is a corporation which will not permit me to work as an RN unless I pay it a fee; that’s extortion. RNs are required to pay yearly fees which in 2001 in Alberta cost me approximately six (6) days of labour - a total of $900 Cdn./$600 USD (a full year’s fee for the 7 months I worked prior to the next year’s fee, both of which came within the same calendar year, along with union dues of $400. The union, by the way, refused to assist me in getting wage compensation of $6 per hour for my 25 years experience. I was working for only 75% of my entitled wage). Taking care of the infirm is now illegal without a permit. What compassionate entity conjured up this plan? This is corporate/ bankster thinking at its best. I never went back and I never looked back; and they wonder why there is a ‘shortage of nurses’. Minimum wage is a huge joke and no one could live on it. These jobs are for kids in school who still live at home and who want some cash for the weekend. It is not designed for those who are intending to ‘earn their living’, and yet many are grateful that they have these worthless jobs because most of what used to be ‘good jobs’ have been exported out of America (‘outsourced’). Never have more people been out of work - not even during the Great Depression. After many years of my being concerned about $$$, I finally had to face the truth which is that I’ve never had to worry about ‘money’. I’ve always had cash. ALWAYS. I quit trying to figure it out. I don’t really know how this can be, since, over the same 35 year period that my colleagues have worked and saved 60"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"for their retirements, I estimate I’ve actually ‘worked’ only one quarter of that time. I have never worked full time, except for 2 brief periods in my twenties, both of which were less than a year. There have been entire years during which I haven’t worked and this is not including when my boys were young and I was being financially supported by their father. I wonder how I’ve managed to survive. I’m not suggesting I did it all on my own; I am suggesting that I’ve never had to worry about $$$ and it is not due to my having worked hard all my life. While it is true that no woman works harder for her money than when she marries it, this was very short-lived. I attribute much of it to learning the credit card scam, probably worth $90,000 to me. Cash has just always had a major presence in my life - not so much that I can take year-long trips around the world or live in the lap of luxury, and, I’ve never owned my own house, but then ..... neither have you. You’ve just worked to pay for one. From a psychological perspective, I say I am better off - at least I know it and I am not deluding myself. No one can take anything from me - I have nothing to take and that which I do have I know how to protect. You’ve heard stories of wives who go off to work and, after commute/ clothing/ childcare expenses along with what the gov’t confiscates in income tax, the family is actually farther behind in net income. What were they thinking? I have enough trouble with the concept of anyone ‘working’ but particularly women. Their job in life is huge enough; - that of dragging their men from the ‘world’ into the spiritual realm. I haven’t even touched upon the time and energy consumption of minding children and creating a home. My divorced friend had to pay tax on her husband’s child support payments, which he got to ‘write off’ as an expense, but she, who desperately needed the extra funds, got to hand over the bulk of it in tax. Something’s wrong, yet this is no surprise to anyone. So why are women working? I am reminded of the woman who left a note on the refrigerator for her husband. “Supper’s in the oven; I’ve gone to law school - I’ll be back in 4 years.” When the simple truth about banking is revealed, we’ll see that the economic effect of their stealing and counterfeiting has meant that wives must work for the family to survive. If the banking problem is corrected, wives will have the option to stop working while keeping the same standard of living or working and doubling the family’s wealth. If enough of us learn about the fraudulent banking system our loans could be forgiven or discharged, the government’s budget balanced, and the personal IRS/CRA tax cut to zero with no other taxes. If the banks paid their debt, we could all be out of debt. Unlimited Credit The amount of credit the feds earned from investing in securities the credit borrowed from us via the registration of our births has pre-paid anything you might ever want or need. We are the creditors, and the federal mafia is the debtor. They owe us interest for using our credit, yet, since they (the Public) are bankrupt, there is no ‘substance money’ so we, as creditors, will have to get paid by taking equity, in the form of our houses and cars, as the ‘set-off’ - the balancing of the account. They owe us interest on our credit which they are using to pay for the manufacturing of all the goods and services we are buying. We have already paid for the product before we buy it. We are still the principals of the securities because said investment was never disclosed to us. The feds are hoping we won’t request the profits of our investments, however, if and when we do, it is substantial enough that we would never have to work again. We could never spend it all. WE DO NOT NEED, NOR WERE WE EVER MEANT, TO ‘WORK FOR A LIVING’ The government floated a bond against our future earnings by using our birth registrations as the collateral for our ‘promise to pay’. Income tax is just their having ‘educated’ you to pay the interest on the loan YOU lent THEM. When we access our Direct Treasury Accounts, those held at the BC/ FRB under our SINs/ SSNs, we will no longer ‘have to’ work. Meanwhile, we will continue to: 1. slave-labour for entities which do not exist except for the purpose of profit, 2. do something other than what we were designed to do, and 3. believe that we (extensions of our Creator) are worthless enough to have to pay for our existence. Our life’s labour and everything we’ve created, have become the legal, commercial collateral of the bankrupt USA/CA Inc. The feds give us back from our labour just enough to keep us convinced that we are actually earning 61"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"enough of a living to buy what we want, when what is true is that most of us cannot afford what we think we want; and even if we truly did want what we think we want, it is already pre-paid. So, not only are we not supposed to be working for any one (banksters) or any thing (corporations) other than for each other and for our own enjoyment but also we already have enough credit to buy anything we want or need; we have just been, so far, prevented from accessing it. Since that is what ALL currency is today – our credit – it ought to be easy to realize that we can use our OWN credit - credit from our exemption, not credit which only creates more debt. Think what would happen to the banksters if we all suddenly had everything we wanted. They would lose their control over us. We wouldn’t need to work, nor worry about ‘paying the bills’, nor believe that there was any authority outside ourselves. (We are an extension of , not separate from, our Creator.) It is our concern and worries over ‘money’ which allow them control over us. How could the powers-that-be - those who are running the world in what seems to be about as disastrous a manner as can be - continue to do what they want to do, e.g.: WAR? There would be no more slave-labour. We would all be working at something that is way more fun. It is said that if we all ‘worked’ at doing what we wanted, all necessary jobs would get done. The remainder, the manufacture of WMD, for example, would either cease to get done or the powers-that-be would have to do it themselves. What a concept! What an interesting place to live this world might become! If you want to make someone angry, tell him a lie; if you want to make him furious, tell him the truth. So, at the risk of infuriating you, isn’t it strange to think that all these years you have been working for what you wanted and unbeknownst to you, everything you ever purchased from every corporation was already paid for. All you had to do was go and claim it, sign for it, and take it home; and this includes your home - it too was prepaid. You never had to work a day in your life to ‘pay for’ anything. All these years you could have been playing and doing what you love to do. We were conned into getting a good education so we could get a good job; all based upon the presumption that this is what we wanted. Would you work as hard as you do if you knew that nothing, which you think you own, belongs to you?

This system forces them to live in a debt cycle which never ends. The system perpetrates an addiction to materialism for the purpose of producing interest which is created from debt. Since debt does not really exist, then neither does interest. Hence, the national debt is a hoax perpetrated by the PTB. The biggest con game the world has ever known was perpetrated by those who control education, law, media, churches, banks, medicine. They played upon our innate belief that we must earn our right to life, that we are unworthy, not to trust our intuition, that we must depend upon the authorities, that any punishment we sustain is justified and deserved, that we have no self-generated power, that what is outside our minds is real. They have confiscated our health, wealth, love, and peace of mind under this ruse. This scam is known as The Matrix. How did we ever get conned into believing that we are required to ‘earn’ our living? The perpetuation of this myth is destroying our true spiritual nature. If my Creator and I co-created my physical existence, then this makes me sovereign, right? Why would I do anything other than just be free to live, to experience? Someone thinks we must pay for the privilege ... who? How did this ever come about? How could we ever have fallen for this nonsense? Someone on this planet had the most brilliant, scathing idea in the history of mankind - to appeal to our egotistical belief that we are all guilty and deserve punishment, that we are something other than who we truly are ... and capitalized upon it. When I began to study law, with the intent of understanding why the world is as stupid as it is, I got only further entrenched. The expanding gap between my demand for peace of mind and that for resisting authority made me crazier than I already was. I knew that what I resist persists and yet I kept trying to make work, something that was designed not to work - the entire corporation/ banking system aka “the military- industrial-congressional complex”, after Eisenhower’s suggestion. I was trying to make sense of something completely nonsensical. However, it does make sense when one realizes that the system under which we function was designed by the ego mind. Our spirit mind is continuously intending to show us that getting upset by trying to change something that isn’t real is the epitome of ‘effort in futility’. It took me years to stop trying to change what isn’t and focus on changing the perceiver - me. The world was the way it was only because I said so. Finally, I opted to learn how to make the system - the one ‘designed not to work’ - work for me. Most of the so-called ‘Patriots’ I knew were busy studying laws, the Internal Revenue Code, statutes, Code of Federal Regulations, US Code sections, US Supreme Court cases and decisions, judges’ rulings, etc. For some reason I just wasn’t interested. They could quote all this stuff yet, intuitively, I felt ... so what? The only one which I found to be significant and worth remembering was Miranda vs. Arizona, wherein we are told, “... Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.” (read EVERY thing you say WILL be used AGAINST you.) No ‘maybe’ here. This particular supreme court ruling stuck with me as being one of the most important things I could ever learn, and ... I was accurate. This is the entire purpose of learning to say nothing - learning NOT to contract unwittingly. A Course In Miracles After thirty-three years of knowing something was seriously wrong, yet not knowing how things could possibly be the way they seem to be, my demand for peace of mind led me to a set of three texts called, A 63"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Course In Miracles . The Course teaches that all which we experience is only a projection of our minds based upon our belief in our guilt due to our belief that we separated from God, which of course is impossible. So .... none of this is happening except in our minds. Every event is just another opportunity to forgive ourselves for thinking that we abandoned God, which is a laughable concept. I think that everything about ACIM requires faith only until the evidence becomes obvious through experience. The Course incorporates both the Big Bang and God's ‘creation’ of the universe. Actually, what ACIM says is that we (all one of us), as an extension of God, and hence God, thought of everything in an instant . This amount of focused energy must have seemed like a ‘big bang’. All of what seems to exist - all time, all dimensions, etc. were ‘created’ as a hologram in an instant, yet it was not a true creation because all of this exists only in our minds - as a thought. The Course tells us that ‘thoughts leave not their source’, hence, what we call ‘creation’ is in fact a ‘miscreation’. That which evidences that it does not extend outside our minds, i.e.: that our Creator is not directly involved, is the duality of everything in our known universe - up down, light dark, male female, bad good, etc. If love is all there is - God being only a light/love energy (and not an entity with human characteristics which the ego mind continues to threaten) - then what is all-encompassing can have no opposite. Whatever we perceive which is not love (and let’s face it, this is most of what we perceive, thanks to the ego), then it can’t possibly exist except in our minds. We made up the entire thing as a dream and our Creator is just waiting for us to wake up and ‘return home’ even though we never left, except in our thoughts, for how could we leave something that is omnipresent? Our only sin is that we believe we separated from God, when, how could we? Think of our Creator/God as a loving parent watching her child experience a bad dream (life as we know it is often referred to as a ‘nightmare’). The parent has no idea what her child is dreaming; she knows only that it is terribly upsetting to the child. The parent can’t intervene into the dream and change it to be more pleasant because the dream exists only in the child’s mind. There is nothing to be done other than to get the child to awaken and realize that he made up the entire dream. Only when the child awakens, will he see how he caused himself such unnecessary grief. But while he is in the dream it seemed completely real. The following night, does the child go back into the dream with the intent to change the previous night’s bad dream, or does he just move on with the next night’s dream’s adventures? The intent of the child is not only to move on but also to experience his dreams as pleasant. Wouldn’t it be particularly convenient if he remained conscious within the dream so that if a bad dream showed up, he could know that none of it was real - that it was just a dream from which he would awaken and have no fear? Thomas Szasz, in his book Myth of Mental Illness , acknowledges the dualities of life and those things which we believe to be scourges of society are really just creations in order for us to be able to see ourselves as opposites, e.g.: to assuage guilt, attorneys need criminals; to feel healthy, medics need sick patients; to feel erudite, professors need students; to feel righteous, church-goers need sinners; to feel privileged, the rich need the poor; to feel generous, philanthropists need welfare recipients, to feel powerful, the ‘authorities’ need the obedient, etc. We each created the opposite of ‘who we think we are’ in order to believe in our own existence. We’re all just continuously attempting to define and defend our existence. The reverse is also true in that our spirit selves - who we really are - do not require the projection of the opposite of us because there is no duality in reality. We actually do exist apart from our belief about who we think we are. Our ‘fear of death’ is not of death per se but of ceasing to exist as who we think we are. Those in Medicine don’t know ‘health’ Those in Schooling don’t know ‘education’ Those in Media don’t know the ‘news’ (what's really going on in the world) Those in Religion don’t know ‘spirituality’ Those in Finance don’t know ‘commerce’ Those in Legal don’t know ‘law’ Those of us outside these disciplines tend to be aware of the mind-manipulation within them. Those within these disciplines cannot escape due to fear for their identity - who they ‘think’ they are. If they ever woke up, who might they BE? Hence, we often reveal what we most loathe about ourselves via our jobs. They represent how we want others to perceive us. I ask every nurse, “Why did you become a nurse?” “I wanted to help people.” Anyone who has ever done any inner work knows that we can’t ‘help’ anyone. We can only assist others in their healing. We all must do our own work. Nurses tend to believe that taking care of others is more honourable than taking care of themselves and their self-loathing is revealed by their rampant addiction to 64"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"substance as well as behaviour. Most nurses are one of or any combination of: overweight, smokers, drinkers, or druggies. Those who aren’t don’t claim to identify themselves as BEing a nurse. They are likely to know, “I am not my job.” Those who try to hide-out with their professions are doing themselves a disservice, not to mention those with whom they come into contact. Cops, collection agents, and all others who intend to intimidate people want the world to perceive them as ‘powerful’ - but only because they believe they are not. Since at some visceral level we all know this, the cop becomes the bully because their jobs fail to assuage them of their belief in their powerlessness. The status of one’s job might seem powerful yet those behind the titles are powerless, by their own estimation, or they wouldn’t have chosen that particular vocation. As Ram Dass said, “Cops are just God in drag.” Lose the Fear, Mare Because we attract only people, places, and things which vibrate at the same level at which we vibrate, it is easy to discover at what level we are vibrating by taking a look at what we have attracted. I never had a clue how frightened of life I was until I outgrew it enough to see the level of fear in my boys’ father. I must have been that frightened and obviously operated at that low level in order to have attracted him to me. At the time I couldn’t see how frightened he was of ‘authority’ because I was seeing him from my perspective which was equally frightened - no contrast. I can now see that my entire quest in life was to outgrow this fear and the route I chose was to test my knowledge about who I truly am - my real, sovereign, powerful, spiritual self - against the alleged ‘authorities’ of this world. Like an ex-smoker’s loathing of the presence of a cigarette smoker, it is difficult for me to be around frightened people - those who still do as they are told by the ‘authorities’ in their lives - the doctors, attorneys, teachers, bureaucrats, ministers, police, etc. Guilt Based upon the belief that we separated from our Creator - the one entity which loves us beyond what we can comprehend - as long as we have an ego mind - we feel somewhat stupid about having left such a loving energy. Who would do that? So, not only do we feel guilt over being stupid but also our ego has convinced us that we have our Creator’s punishment to fear if and when we finally do get back ‘home’. Our spirit mind does its level best to persuade us that this Creator is loving and isn’t even capable of blame and punishment, but our ego mind tells us we are bad and deserve punishment and upon our death, we will ‘meet our maker’, we will be judged, and there will be Hell to pay. This is just more of the same bad dream. We have projected our ego thinking onto an entity which has no ego. This is simply a love energy, the highest ever to exist, and our petty little minds think that It cares about punishing us? For what? Making up nonsense in a bad dream? Does our parent punish us upon our awakening from a bad dream? No, mum is overjoyed that our peace of mind has been restored and we are no longer suffering. Does she have us tell her all about our bad dream and what horrible role we played in the dream, thereby prolonging the agony? No; if she’s smart she will tell us that its all over and nothing to worry about - it was “just a bad dream”. But, in this life on this planet - which we made up - we feel as if what we are dreaming - that we separated from God - is an attack against God who will most certainly seek revenge when He gets His mitts on us. Why do most of us fear death? Because we fear the punishment that God is going to bestow upon us as soon as He judges how bad we were. Did mum punish us even when we told of the horrible things we did in our bad dream or did she just hug us and say how glad she is that we are out of our nightmare? We cannot usurp the power of an all-powerful entity, a ubiquitous loving light. What kind of arrogance has this ego which thinks it can remove itself from something which is everywhere always? Nevertheless, we are stuck with this absurd guilt from which we run our entire lives. What our egos tell us though is, that what works better is to inflict this guilt onto someone else so that we don’t look so guilty in the eyes of God, so that, upon our arrival ‘home’, our fellows will catch more Hell than we will. Well, the glitch to this is that if it is all my bad dream, there is only one of me and so inflicting guilt onto someone whom my ego tells me is not I, is just making my own circumstances worse. There is no one out there to accept my guilt and the only thing I have accomplished is to go further unconscious. Now I am in a situation which will ultimately cause me more grief because I feel more guilt for having attacked another aspect of myself. There is no one out there. It is ALL my bad dream. Life is quite interesting in parts but no substitute for the real thing. - Douglas Adams 65"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"A Course In Miracles No meaning that comes from outside ourselves is real. Nothing real can be threatened; nothing unreal exists. Herein lies the peace of God. The crux of the Course is the relinquishment of fear and the acceptance of love. As this process of mental realignment works within the individual, it spreads through him to revitalize the lives of those around him. The means of this transformation is the practice of forgiveness. The goal of the Course is the attainment of inner peace. We were given the Course for several reasons which include: 1) the necessity of healing the mind of its belief in ‘attack is salvation’; this is accomplished through forgiveness and the undoing of our belief in the reality of separation and guilt. 2) correcting the errors of Christianity , particularly where it has emphasized suffering, sacrifice, separation, and sacrament as inherent to God’s plan of salvation. 3) emphasizing the importance of Jesus and/or the Holy Spirit as our loving and gentle Teacher, and developing a personal relationship with this Teacher. Whatever I think is going on in the world is going on only in my mind. Many other aspects of myself, those of me of different colour, race, economic status, location, creed, sex, build, etc. seem to agree with me - well, its my dream, right? I can have it any way I choose, unless of course I am so unconscious that I am not in control of my dreams. I notice, just for the sake of drama, my dream includes those who appear to disagree with me. I call them Banksters. No good dream is without the ‘bad guys’, eh? Take a look at what is going on in my dream: 95% of the wealth is held by 5% of the people, so at age 65: 1% are wealthy 4% can retire 29% are dead 63% are on SSA/ CP or charity You can see where this makes my ego want to blame the PTB for making miserable, most of the other aspects of myself in this world. The problem with blame is that I make it real. If I think someone is trying to hurt me, this is indicative of my belief that I deserve punishment. Since I now fully understand that I do not and I do energy work daily to release our ancient belief in guilt, I notice that where my now much- more-peaceful mind takes me is into actions which benefit all of us - even the black hearts. They also will ultimately be better off when the rest of us wake up. I intend not to fight them or even to make them particularly miserable; my intention is to do what works for me and any other aspect of myself who happens to know that resistance only causes the persistence of a situation. It gives it energy. I use my energy to get what I want, not to stop anyone else from having what my ego doesn’t want them to have. As with everything else, our chances of becoming wealthy are always 50/50 - either we will or we won’t, however, the odds of the gov’t confiscating it increase daily. So, among the solutions to this are: 1. give up 2. work ‘harder’ 3. find a better way, i.e.: change my mind about the whole thing. Only the last one affords us any freedom. Digging in the same hole will only get us deeper. We must make a lateral move and look somewhere other than what the PTB tell us to do which is to ‘work’ longer / harder, invest astutely, and take a chance on the lottery. Each of these alleged solutions only keeps us chasing after ‘nothing’. It will not get us what we want. People are desperate to ‘make money’. What does this tell you? The FEAR surrounding $$$ is the best indication that we are barking up the wrong tree. All I ask is a chance to prove that money won’t make me happy. - Ashleigh Brilliant If women truly want to work, and I’ve met four who do, then this becomes a case of their doing what they want to do. If they don’t want to work and are doing so solely for the $$$, they need to understand that this is an effort in futility. They will have much of it confiscated in one form or another; they will be denying themselves time to do what they want to do; they will become a number on the federal books; and 66"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"most important, they are believing that the solution to the problem of ‘not enough money’ is to get more money. It is not. The solution to the problem of ‘not enough money’ is to learn that there is no money and going after something which not only doesn’t exist but also is digging them into an even greater hole, is at best, bandaid solution and at worst, literally ignoring the cause. Remembering that cause and effect are always reversed from what our egos believe, the idea is to get rid of our alleged money. I know this sounds anathema to most people but if $$$ represents debt, why would we want it? Anything we think we are ‘buying’ with it doesn’t belong to us because how can we own anything for which we did not give value. Those of you who are proud of yourselves that you have worked hard all your lives and can now admit to living in a house that is ‘paid off’ and driving a car which is ‘paid for’, and have enough $$$ for retirement due to wise investing, are in for a big surprise. All you have done during those years of labour and slick investing is moved from steerage up to first class on the Titanic. The system is about to collapse. Having more of ‘nothing’ than everyone else still leaves you with ... nothing. Have you ever been playing a game of Monopoly®™ and part way through the game you realize that there is no way you can win: your opponent owns most of the good properties, you own most of the cheap properties and there are no properties, utilities, or railroads left to buy. Racing your car across the yellow/ red and green/blue sides of the board is like going through a mine field. You know you’ll never make it without landing on something with a hotel and 3 houses. You look at your available cash, the chances of getting to ‘GO’ for a measly $200, and yet another trip around the board, the odds of your opponent landing on your hardly built-up properties, and decide to throw in the towel. Is this just being a sore loser? - a quitter? Or is this wisdom? Why not concede? Why suffer any further indignities? What is the gain in playing until completely bankrupt? Why waste any more time? Why not play ... something else ? The IBs’ Commerce Game is a game only they can win. The Banksters can not lose; they have forced everyone to play and they have forced everyone into a debt from which we cannot escape. US/CA, as a bankrupt corporation, is owned completely by its creditors - the Bankers. They own all levels of the media, government, education, religion, everything; if you have a birth certificate, they own you too. They control every transaction; they control what is going on in the world; they even control the puppet whom the world blames for the terror and threat of war - GW. Do you like the results of this control? Are you enjoying the game? The only way to win the Commerce Game is not to play. We were never meant to operate in commerce; they tricked us into it and for their benefit. Isn’t there something we’d rather be doing? What do banks do with this credit which we created with our signing of promises to pay? They lend it. Banks are not permitted to lend their money or their assets; they are allowed to lend only credit; credit which WE created. There is only liability which is being spread around with the added liability of interest attached to it each time it is used to ‘pay’ someone. The value of the note is thus diminished each time. Hence, we have inflation. When I ostensibly ‘pay’ you $50 for a service you provided me, since I am paying you with notes which were borrowed into existence, and now have interest attached to it, how can it ever get paid? From whence comes the interest to pay when the interest has yet to be borrowed into existence. If I borrow your car, how can I bring back more of your car than I borrowed? It doesn’t exist. Every transaction gets us further into a debt which does NOT exist, except in the minds of the Banksters. The only way for us to win is not to play. Earning and/or using the bankster’s notes is tantamount to the alcoholic's drinking to obliterate his stark realization of his horrible circumstances created by his drinking. Talk about a downward spiral! There is no recovery unless one simply stops drinking, i.e.: gets OUT of the Commerce Game. We can NOT win by accumulating more of what is impoverishing us. But how can one opt out? What is vastly more important than this alleged debt from which we can never escape, are the emotional and spiritual repercussions of the circumstances created by this vicious cycle, which are intentional, by the way. What better way to control people than to impoverish them? Only one way - keep them in FEAR over poverty. Herein lies a seeming dilemma. How can we exempt ourselves from a game which everyone is playing? To think that we will be farther ahead “if we just had more money” is pure folly. Many take on second and third jobs in order to ‘make more money’. They are just taking another drink. They are snow- ploughing the problem which removes them only farther from recovery. We might have to bear the pain of withdrawal, but think of the freedom if we can survive it! We might have to apply the 12-step program and simply have faith that the energy of our Creator will direct us if we will only remove our souls from the addiction which is causing our sense of powerlessness. We must intend for our freedom from our attachment to the belief that ‘money’ will keep us safe. It will not. It is keeping us dependent and, like alcohol to the addict, making our situation worse as each day passes . We might have to quit our jobs in order to remove ourselves from confiscatory taxation, from the belief that there will be a pension when we 67"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"retire, from the hope that if we get sick our ‘health benefits package’ or the ‘National Health will kick in. How might we feel if we became totally dependent upon ourselves, each other, and our Creator which has revealed in no uncertain terms that we will not perish if we apply the energy of faith into the concept of ‘our needs will be met’. We must develop the faith of our Creator; not faith in our Creator, but the faith of our Creator. What if God intended to do something and then wondered whether it would work or not? - Dennis Krum. We can not find safety and security in something that does not exist. There is no money . Many ‘New Age’ people talk about there being “enough money for everyone’. I want to tell them: Of what you think as ‘money’ there is only $263 billion US in circulation. Considering Bill Gates alone is worth $46 billion (or so), much of it is off-shore, much of it is unaccountable because of its entanglement with the drug trade, and still millions are out there under mattresses, etc. leaves only a maximum of about $700 per living soul, $1,400 if you want to count only adults. So, there is NOT enough ‘money’ for everyone. What there is, is credit and that amount is unlimited. One woman lamented that she and her husband had been $30,000 in debt. She quickly qualified that as “not cash that we handed over; it was credit card debt”. This alleged ‘credit card debt’ does not exist. It is ‘credit’, not debt’; the secret of this is revealed in its name - ‘credit card’ as opposed to ‘debt card’. She is under the misconception that she ‘borrowed’ credit when in fact she created it and the bank extended to her only a fraction of that which she created with her own signature. She does not ‘owe’ credit card debt; there is nothing to re-pay. It is all EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer). The bank never gave her anything. Who among us will step out of the belief, “the more money I have, the safer I will be? Who will quit the corporate career which keeps the average man enslaved for a lifetime of labour for barely enough to get by. There is no power in continuing this. Upon our death beds, will we wonder why we kept doing what we did? I imagine meeting my Creator and being asked, “So why didn’t you do what you wanted to do?” There is no acceptable response to this. What, ... “fear”? My Creator laughs and asks, “Didn’t you believe me when I told you that I would provide for you ... that you had nothing to fear ... that you are an extension of me and so you have access to my power? What could possibly have frightened you?” “I was told I had to work for a living; I had to justify my existence; I had to do something useful; I had to prove my worth, the Protestant Work Ethic ...” - blah, blah, blah. The Creator just laughs, “Why would you listen to the propaganda of those who would take your power from you, who would frighten you, who would enslave you, when you could have chosen to recall what I promised you, which would have granted you peace?” What’s to say? So, we must begin to work for each other. I must do for you what I know best to do - my talent bestowed upon me by my Creator - what I love to do. Isn’t this what I ought to be doing? Will you do for another what you love to do? Will this feel like ‘work’? No. Will your friend do for me what I want done and yet am not particularly good at doing? Will he be happy to do this for me? You bet. Are we not our happiest when we serve ourselves through serving others? If indeed ‘we are all one’, won’t I see that doing for another living soul is the same as serving me? Whom are we charging and how much and for what? Let there be peace on earth and let it begin with me. Will I, somewhere along my path of doing what I want to do, just happen to notice that I am no longer serving a major corporation, but rather my fellow living souls? Corporations, by definition, do not exist. They are legal fictions. The purpose for their alleged existence is for their limited liability and that of the living souls who operate them. The ‘law’ does not go after an entity who ‘owns’ nothing. Corporations have nothing to give. You can’t get blood from a stone. Now you see why the wealthiest in the world ‘own nothing yet control everything’. We ought to take a lesson. We ought to stop wanting to own things, since we can’t anyway because we do not have legal title to the things we think we own; we have only equitable title. We are allowed to ‘use’ that which the state allows us to use. This includes our bodies. We can not ‘own’ anything for which we haven’t ‘paid’ or for which we have relinquished title, e.g.: our bodies via the birth registration. Since we have nothing with which to pay, we ‘own’ nothing - unless - we use asset funds to ‘pay’ for legal title. Unfortunately, unless we have handled our commercial affairs properly, we also can not ‘control’ anything. We must take back our lives and do what we want to do before we will be forced to do what corporate entities want us to do and for less than we’re getting now. We must put our commercial affairs in order. We must get OUT of the Commerce Game and get used to the idea of ‘service’. As an interim part of getting there, for those of us who can’t make the leap, we can and are doing ‘exchanges’. We can exchange’ time, our talent, our labour, or some other commodity upon which we agree. This is commonly 68"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"known as ‘barter’ and yet, it still involves accounting of which we will ultimately have to let go - rather like going from alcohol to candy - eventually, we have to clear the anxiety which is behind the addiction since it is ‘fear’ which keeps us chasing $$$. We will have arrived when we can admit, ‘I do for you what I do and you do for me what you do’. That’s it - just the joy of doing what we know we were meant to do. Since I have been doing what I want to do I have never been happier and I have received more, in ways I could never have anticipated, than I ever have. Even this book is free for the asking. My analogy is that the Commerce Game is tantamount to the Nightmare; not so ruthless is Barter/ Exchange; this will transform the nightmare into a pleasant dream. Yet, pleasant or not, a dream means we are still asleep. So barter/exchange/pleasant dream still means we haven’t made the quantum leap to service and doing what we love to do which is tantamount to Waking UP! I wonder if we can skip the interim step. Maybe, as Ian Lungold (mayanmajix.com) suggests, we are being watched by others from an alternate dimension (time or space) in the same manner as one might watch a sporting event - empathizing with those who err and cheering on the winners, all the while knowing that none of it matters because its only a game. The day I read his article it just so happened was the same day I received, via registered post, a threatening letter from the Alberta Association of Registered Nurses which listed all the terrible things which would happen to me if I didn't submit to their RICO (extortion and racketeering) licensure. One is they will no longer permit me to slave labour for that fictional, corrupt, extortive, corporate entity referred to, euphemistically, as ‘Alberta Health and Wellness’ without paying them to let me. I am no longer permitted to poison people for them, nor to support my family, which is now illegal if I don't pay them off. Of course my ego taunted me with not being able to ‘earn a living’, the repercussions of which might have caused me to vacillate. “Burn no bridges”, it told me. Essentially, I would no longer be permit ted to work (taking care of old people in the nursing home is illegal unless one has paid the PTB for a permit rendering it legal) as of the end of 2002. I intend to do what I want to do. I can’t help thinking maintaining my RN licence was in fact part of what was keeping me from breaking free because it represents fear as opposed to faith in my right and ability to do that which I feel certain is my purpose in this lifetime. Lungold suggests that when we take a stand and do what we know to be ethical, energy from the collective unconscious (those cheering us on) allows us to succeed. Our ethical choices begin an upward spiral for getting the results which our true selves intend for us. It is the shift from fear which creates the vacuum for these results to show up - creating the space to have it be the way we want it. Wouldn’t you just hate to find yourself in the ‘after death dimension’ and have your Creator ask, “Why did you do what you knew was unethical? Why did you breach your integrity?” Eeeeewwww. “Getting Ahead” aka “Divide and Conquer” The belief that we need money in order to pay debts gets really shabby when we realize that we are operating from fear. Haven’t we been promised that we will be ‘provided for? Yet we operate our entire lives from competing with one another. Does this suit the banksters, or what? If they can keep us in a position of either envying or holding in disdain, another whose financial circumstances differ from our own, they have succeeded in upholding our belief that we are separate from one another. Divide and conquer. As long as we believe we are separate, we will continue to compete, and we will remain alone against those who wish to enslave us. It is happening . For commerce to work there must be a debtor and a creditor. An account is created to keep track of the debts and credits. In commerce, the only way one can win is to have more debtors than creditors. This is done by starting a business. We then sell to others, our time and talent. The more people you find with needs the more debtors you have. The problem with this system is that we are forced to be in competition with others who are offering the same time and talent. In order for one to win, the other must lose. The more people I put out of business the better I can support my family. We make our brother a debtor to us by working for the ‘love of money’ instead of the ‘love of service’ and giving our time and talent in love. When we keep accounts - who owes whom - we keep a record of wrongs. Also, to win in commerce we must destroy the competition. Nothing personal, it’s just business. - Nicholas Grachanin It is lose/lose because it is based upon the concept of separation. The Commerce Game is the epitome of the manifestation of our egoistic belief that we are separate from one another . Not only are we entertaining the elite, but also they live off our energy which is translated into the tax we pay for our licences which allow us to work - a vicious cycle which is a lose/lose for us, as our time, 69"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"talent, energy, and spirituality is wasted and misdirected.

Each progressive spirit is opposed by a thousand mediocre minds appointed to guard the past ~ Maurice Maeterlinck It does not require a majority to prevail, but rather an irate, tireless minority keen to set brush fires in people's minds. - Samuel Adams There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root. - H.D. Thoreau Commerce has to do with the buying and selling of goods having ‘profit as the chief aim’ which means ‘gain’. ‘Gain/ profit’ is not a matter of mere exchange but includes the idea of increase, usually at someone else’s expense. There is no ‘getting ahead’ - getting ahead of what or of whom? Your present status? The other fellow? The only way to get ahead of someone else is first to regard him as someone other than yourself. Those who get ahead by moving up in the world are not getting anything but ‘more world’. ‘Getting ahead’ usually means getting better than ‘breaking even’, i.e.: living paycheque to paycheque, but there’s nothing wrong with that because clearly our needs are being met and we’re breaking even - jumbo limbo. What ‘breaking even’ does is simply instill us with fear ... ‘what if?’ We all want a cushion. Those who believe they need cushions, generally create a need for a cushion - like those who spend a fortune on every type of insurance - medical, car, professional, etc. - at those prices I sure hope they get to use it. I spent my life trying to get ahead and realized I wouldn’t do much else because my ego held no defining line on this. What is enough? As long as it keeps us wanting more, we’ll never be at peace. To the question, “How much is enough?”, Rockefeller responded, “Just a little more than I have.” A friend is concerned that her taxes are going to fund this and that with which she doesn’t agree. Taxes don’t go anywhere - except to the IMF - to fund anything - except Communism. Communism got a bad rap in the 50s when McCarthy went bonkers over the House Committee for un- American Activities, but let’s face it, what is Communism but state-owned/ controlled everything. The state now owns the securities on your body, your house, your automobile, your marriage, your children, your property, so don’t pretend we don’t live under Communism - we do; we’ve just been tricked into thinking otherwise because it has been disguised precisely the way Kruschev declared - “We’ll get you without bombs, in a way you’ll never realize.” They will destroy us from the inside - not a shot will be fired. Why do you think they came up with the ‘Hate Crime Bill”? To remind us to hate. Just like the feds’ War On Everything - it reminds us where to put our energy and our attention. On what we put our attention increases. Energy flows where attention goes. These people aren’t stupid; they are diabolical. How do you keep your children from doing something which doesn’t work for them? Keep telling them not to do it? No, all that does is remind them to do it. (Don’t think of a pink elephant) This is Psych 101. Doesn’t anyone remember? If the feds can get you to hate another - done best by reminding you not to - then forcing you to hand over your $$$ to fund the needs of the ‘other’, then they win. People aren’t seeing the whole picture because they are seeing it from inside the frame. Our five-sense reality is unreliable. The feds keep our egos in survival mode and convince us that what is not true is true. Let me repeat that the ego’s qualifications as a guide are singularly unfortunate. - ACIM Remember an old Twilight Zone episode where a bunch of small town folks all gathered in the street in the middle of the night because something strange had happened and they were attempting to get to the bottom of it. I don’t recall if it were a flying saucer or a loud noise or strange lights but they were frightened as they began to guess what happened. Because of their fear they began to accuse one another of previous suspicious behaviour and therefore their possible connection with this. As each man or woman felt attacked, s/he became defensive and attacked someone else. This escalated into nonsense and then into viciousness. The camera panned farther and farther back until we saw two men in some sort of strange environment (like a spaceship) who have been watching all this. One said to the other, “See? We don’t have to do anything - they’ll destroy themselves.” Rod Serling was ahead of his time. Although I knew for years that I had attached my own value to that of my economic assets, the penny dropped only recently, thereby allowing me to see all the times I had equated my value, as an extension of my Creator, with something which didn’t even exist except in the ‘minds of men’. It was a rude awakening and very freeing. It allowed me to see others in the same light. I promptly forgave us all for not having 70"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"‘made it in the world’; I even forgave those who had, since, after all, we’re all just doing the best we can. We’ve heard all our lives that we ought not to take life so seriously, that we must stop and smell the roses, that we need time for relaxation, that “upon our death beds we will not be wishing we’d spent more time at the office”, etc. This is a classic example of something we know in our hearts is true and yet behave completely contrariwise. This is what causes our distress, commonly heard as “I’m under a lot of stress.” If what we were doing - working too hard for too many hours a day away from our loved ones - were in keeping with our true natures we would not be feeling distress. It is the conflict which causes our angst. We have innate knowledge that our Creator did not intend for us to be anything but joyous or doing anything which does not bring us joy. I have a continual vision of my Creator slapping its forehead (if indeed Creators even have foreheads) wondering why we insist upon torturing ourselves. Nightmare How is it that both the ‘good guys’ and the ‘bad guys’ think that God is on their side? The Course teaches that God has nothing to do with any of this, that we made up the entire nightmare and that God (love/light energy) is simply waiting for us to wake up and remember that we never left except in our insane thought system. We are extensions of our Creator, not separate from it, as most religions teach. Religions teach that God created the beauty of the world and yet not the starving children of the world. How can any mind reconcile this contradiction? God had nothing to do with this world and the evidence of this is the duality of the world. The concept of God is that it just is - there is no other side of it. What is all- encompassing can have no opposite. God can not impact events which are occurring only within our minds. Since a creator can not create anything which is not of itself, how could God create something which is not God-like? We are all a shattered pane of glass - each shard, seemingly separate from the other is all from the same pane; why bother thinking of it as anything but a part of us. So, God couldn’t possibly have any idea what we’re up to. It knows only love and light. As convincing as our nightmare is while we are in it still does not make it true. All we have to do is WAKE UP. What am I doing at a level of consciousness where this seems real? - Werner Erhard This is where we are headed with this process. EVERYTHING we have been taught as true is NOT. We must start over. The biggest culprit is the Education system. John Taylor Gatto got out of teaching because “I refuse to harm another child”. Read his latest, The Underground History of American Education . Its the same story as the banksters. Our entire world/universe is a hologram which is solely a projection of our FEAR. Makes you wonder what we’re doing here, doesn’t it? We’re all involved in the biggest con game ever. Can we wake up in time and get out of it? If so, how? Most solutions of the world are bandaid solutions - fixing the effect - the signs and symptoms. A better way to change the effect is to heal the cause, however this still keeps us stuck in believing there is a problem. Treating either ‘cause’ or ‘effect’ focuses on the problem. The only solution is to create a third option which has nothing to do with either ‘cause’ or ‘effect’. It has to do with the creation of what works. Focus on what we want. Focus on something which ‘appears’ not to be in existence right now. Just create its appearance because its always been there - just like everything else within the hologram. Affirmations Affirmations will get you what you think you want, but that won’t bring you peace. - Ken Wapnick I always knew affirmations didn’t work because every time I said any, all I could think was, “Who am I trying to convince?” I realized that if something were true, I wouldn’t need to affirm it. It would just be. If something is the truth you don’t have to believe it. - Werner Erhard So, putting notes on my bathroom mirror didn’t remind me of anything other than the fact that I didn’t yet have what I claimed I wanted. In Rapid Eye Technology we learned to do Energy Circles. We put all our “I AMs” into the circle, then added a bunch of energy, and became part of that energy. So, thinking I had a better idea, I continued to affirm, but instead of using an energy circle, I tapped on energy spots (meridians) on my body: I AM safe, I AM prosperous, etc. - still didn’t work. One morning I suddenly knew that the glitch in all this is that what I am affirming is already true; the 71"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"problem was that I didn’t feel it. Whether something is true or not became irrelevant; what mattered is how I was feeling . I was reminded of Paul McCartney who claimed that with all his millions he still feared the day when he might be destitute. The ultimate matter is always peace of mind. Clearly his $$$ had not (at that point in his life) brought him peace. Yes, I hear you saying, “Well, it would me.” It would not, so nevermind. What we want is to feel prosperous and safe, since all that matters anyway is what is going on in our minds. Whether the evidence bears out is immaterial and irrelevant. We want to feel . Since everything we experience is interpretation, who cares what seems to be the material? If its all a dream, do you want a happy dream or a scary dream? So, in changing my affirmations to “I feel safe, I feel prosperous, etc. everything began to change. Since my state of mind - my attitude - is everything - and it is my thoughts which have the power to create, I now had the means to create everything I need and everything I consciously desire. Thoughts originating from the high vibratory state of love/joy emotions will naturally and quickly attract like. The trick is to monitor one’s thoughts and state of mind. We must remain vigilant. The secret to life is ‘Mind Management’. We must change our minds about what we think about the world. Seek not to change the world; seek rather to change your mind about the world - ACIM The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable man persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends upon the unreasonable man. Progress is impossible without change, and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything. - G. Bernard Shaw Imagine how we would feel if we knew we were just dreaming everything, that we were making up all of it, that none of it mattered, and we could feel any way about it that we chose to feel, and that the feeling itself would create the next part of the dream. Remember those who turn around to see the monster chasing them. What if we laughed? Norman Livergood talks about Von Senden’s book; “... persons who have gained their sight through surgery show a remarkable unwillingness to ‘see’. For most of us, it would seem that one who was given one’s sight would be immediately eager to learn how to use this new capability. But the old habits of blindness are powerful influences. “In the same way, ordinary sighted people who are given the opportunity to ‘see’ the world often refuse to look at what is really happening. They prefer their ‘blindness’: being told what to think and do by others. It does no good to show these people what the truth is; they simply do not want to see it. The old habits of prejudice and subjection to ‘authority figures’ is much too comfortable. “It is ignorance that causes us to identify ourselves with the body, the ego, the senses, or anything that is not the Higher Consciousness. He is a wise man who overcomes this ignorance by devotion to the Higher Consciousness. - Shankara, The Crest Jewel of Wisdom” During the 70s and 80s the human potential movement seminars categorically stated that one must have not only goals but also the means written in triplicate in order to execute said personal or professional goals. They had us writing affirmations up the yin yang in the hope that somehow our subconscious mind would implement what our conscious mind seemed incapable of doing. Our lists were endless. In 1989 I went to a spiritual retreat at the Foundation for A Course In Miracles during which Kenneth Wapnick said, “Affirmations work. They will bring you what you think you want. Yet getting what we think we want will not grant us peace. We have no idea what we truly want.” The only way to master the physical plane is by avoiding goal-oriented actions. Barbara Miller A ‘want’ comes from the ego mind which is based upon fear - “seek but do not find”. My friend corroborates this by telling me that a woman could write her list of all the qualities she wants in a man and when she finally gets the man, she thinks, “YIKES ! Did I forget to write ‘ non -homicidal maniac’?” I have a tape wherein Marianne Williamson is coaching a fellow who had been writing affirmations about getting a bit part on Hill Street Blues (it’s an old tape) and he asked if she were saying it’s wrong for him to do this. She told him, “No, you will probably manage to land a bit part on Hill Street Blues if you continue to write affirmations. The problem lies in the possibilities which you are excluding. When God/ the Universe/ Life/ Your Higher Self/ creates a role for you in a major movie, you will be unavailable because you’ll be under contract with Hill Street Blues.” In other words our ego minds are not playing full on. We are playing small because we are operating from fear created by a belief that we don’t deserve to have what we want. The PTB hope we will continue to believe this and thwart any attempts to gain consciousness - keep us watching TV where they can control what we think. What might be in store for us 72"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"is much bigger than we could ever imagine. Our egos limit us. Our spirits free us. The PTB keep us in anger and fear - this is how they survive - on our low vibratory energy. They need us for everything; they need our psychological low negative energy and they need our commercial energy. If we just agree not to play, they can’t survive. They are the projected ego mind. When we don’t tolerate our ego’s negative chatter, it goes away. We need to stop giving these thugs our energy because they love it. We need to ‘Focus Higher’. We must keep our psychic energy high. We must be ‘light’ workers. Negative circumstances will fail to survive when we refuse to sustain them with emotional energy. Today, the stranglehold of the controlling negative forces upon Earth is extremely advanced and is choking the very life from our planet. The effects of this are evident everywhere in the form of fear, separation, war, disease and multifarious kinds of disharmony on all levels. David Icke, The Veil of Tears Further to illustrate that there is nothing outside the mind, not even what our five senses tell us, David Icke tells the story of a man being hypnotized to believe his daughter is not in the room and although she is standing directly in front of him, facing him, he cannot see her. He can , however, see the inscription on the watch held, by the hypnotist, to the small of her back. His mind was most certainly reading from outside his physical vision. We think we know what we want and swear that we are not happy because we don’t have what we want and that we won’t be happy until we have what we want. In a Twilight Zone episode a man wanted only to read. Everything else in his life was a distraction which kept him from his books. His wife, his son, his work, everything was a problem for him because he just wanted to be left alone. One day he awoke and everything in life was the same except there were no people in his world to keep him from reading. His wife and son were not at breakfast so he could read the newspaper in peace; and when he arrived at work all was in order but there were no colleagues demanding his time so he got to spend the day reading. He was finally happy. He arrived home, his supper was on the table but no wife to keep him from his book. Life was finally perfect. Everything seemed to be the way he had always wanted it and not one living soul to keep him from his passion - reading. One evening he went down to the basement for something. Upon his climbing the stairs, for some reason he bent over and his glasses fell out of his pocket and smashed on the cement floor. His stark realization that there was no optician to replace his glasses put such fear into me (not to mention him) that from then on I questioned everything I ever again thought I wanted. We have all heard, “you can’t change anyone but yourself.” Trying to change those who govern us is a waste of time and energy. The gov’t doesn’t exist; it is a fictitious entity, so the only entities attempting to govern us are simply living souls/ private entities just as we are. They are not the gov’t (as in, “I’m from the gov’t and I’m here to help you.”) If they personally have no claim against us, they have no clout. They must have a claim in order to exact performance from us. We can change either our minds about how we interpret what they’re doing and not doing, or we can change our status - ideally both, so we are no longer at the effect of those in the business of confiscating our funds. Fortunately, there are ways to do this. Root of All Evil ? Many ‘New Age’ therapists, practitioners, make a huge deal of the terms, ‘prosperity, abundance, manifesting money, deserving wealth’, etc. Needless to say, this point is being made due to our innate belief we don’t have it, don’t deserve it, or that we are in some way resisting it. Many books have been written about the fact that there is nothing wrong with ‘money’ and that we need to get over our psychological trauma, whether from childhood or just our present belief in ‘poverty consciousness’ in order to thrive in our world. Even the Bible is used to clarify that the quotation, “for the love of money is the root of all evil” is not “ Money is the root of all evil”. Inevitably someone will mention Jesus in the temple throwing over the tables of the tax collectors. Why did he do this? Its one of the few references in the Bible where Jesus allegedly loses his temper. Was it the tax collectors he so loathed or was it that commerce was being carried out in his temple? Who knows? I have had a love/ hate relationship with money my entire life and I’m certain I’m not alone in this. It took me years to reconcile; I realized that ‘money’ is indeed the problem - rather, represents the problem. I became ripping tired of hearing, “money is just an exchange of energy”, “its only bad if you say its bad”, “there is nothing inherently wrong with money - its how its used that matters”, “money, as with everything else in the world, is only how we think of it”, “there is enough money for everyone”, etc. All this is rubbish for the sole purpose of justifying and assuaging our fear as in our hearts we know there is something inherently wrong with the concept of ‘money’. All the ‘wrong’ 73"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"on this planet is due to someone’s belief that ‘money’ will improve their circumstances. In her book, Atlas Shrugged , Ayn Rand says, “The lovers of money are willing to work for it. They know they are able to deserve it.” As much as I love Rand’s philosophy, Objectivism - an ethic of rational self-interest, she is approaching it from a belief that ‘money’ exists since her books were all written prior to the revelation that “there is no money”. It was virtually unknown until somewhat recently even though the bankruptcy is 70 years old (in the US, older in Canada since Canada was never solvent). This, and all philosophies about money include that we are meant to work for it. I have no fear of work but not for something of no substance and not for something which is keeping me enslaved. I notice that it is the pittance which keeps people stuck in jobs they hate. If there were no ‘pay’ would you continue to do what you are doing? We living souls were never meant to operate in commerce; only the strawman can do so. Money is the most tangible evidence in our entire existence of our belief in our separation from one another. This, and only this, is why it is the root of all evil. It is the biggest, most common demonstration of our belief that we are not ‘all one’. We use money every day, albeit often interpreted as an exchange, yet by far more often it is clearly regarded as a ‘payment for’ .... not much. One of my favourite stories to demonstrate this is Ram Dass’ making an album years ago. His father asked him what he intended to charge for it. “About $6 - just my costs.” His father (an attorney - need I say more?) was stunned. “You can get way more for it than that.” Ram Dass responded, “Remember last summer Uncle Harry came to you for legal advice? What did you charge him?” “Nothing, Uncle Harry is family.” Ram Dass replied, “Anyone who buys my album is family.” We have all experienced the feelings of importance, gratitude, love, and also relief when someone gives us a break on cost. Is it possible for us to expand our circle of friends and family to “Any friend of yours is a friend of mine”? It is said that we are only 6 people away from anyone on the planet. I think that we are all so connected at a particular level of consciousness that somehow we all realize that anyone, even from a completely different culture, religion, country, race, IS “my self”. If we were all family, we would feel no compunction about doing what we do and charging nothing. Well, we are all family - why are we charging for what we do? Is it because too many of us are doing what we don’t want to do and so we are subconsciously demanding compensation for our suffering? Whose fault is it that we are doing something that doesn’t grant us joy? Why not stop doing what we don’t enjoy doing? What if we were all doing what we love to do? Would we feel as if we needed to be compensated? Why? I have heard several Rapid Eye Technicians, including me, claim, “I love doing Rapid Eye so much, if I didn’t need to pay the rent, I’d do it for free.” Along the way we’ve also conjured up this absurd idea that if we don’t pay for something we don’t appreciate it. Says who? Some of my dearest possessions I have received at no cost. Think of an item you bought ‘on sale’ - don’t you actually feel better about the object for having gotten a bargain? I agree that the ego believes it doesn’t deserve ‘something for nothing’, however, this is a problem with an egotistical belief system which requires release and healing; it is never the circumstances which require healing - there is nothing outside the mind. So paying for something in order to ‘appreciate’ it is just another con game of the ego mind and anyone who repeats it is again falling for the belief that we are separate from one another. My mother said of my father, “He knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.” I have learned that: 1. the higher the cost of something the less value it ends up having; 2. if someone is charging me an extortive amount for something then he doesn’t really want me to have it. If he doesn’t want me to have it why might I want it? 3. since I began doing what I want to do I have received by far more than I would have received had I charged someone for ... my doing what I want to do or doing what I don’t want to do. The big win is that I have more people in my life. Since it is only people who can get me what I want and need, this is by far better than having cash to hand over to the corporations for something they have caused me to believe I want - and don’t truly want. So, what about ‘paying the rent’? My guess is the answer to this lies in trust and faith. If we are indeed doing what we love to do we find ourselves vibrating at a very high level at which we manage to attract not only what we require but also what we desire. Many books, e.g.: Lynn Gladhorn’s Excuse Me, Your Life is Waiting , reference this and so I shan’t elucidate. One who so appreciates what we do might want to show his appreciation and ask how he can do this. A good response might be, “Well ... the rent is due...” I figure for all those who are still believing that they lose when someone else wins, doing what we love to do will set us at such a high vibrational level that we will automatically attract those who have nothing better to do than to hand over to you that which you need since contractually it would seem to them that you have 74"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"already done the same. After years of having understood intellectually, I finally ‘got it’: if I go into anything with a sense of what I might lose, whether $$$, time, compensation, or energy, I am not doing what I love to do and hence, it simply won’t work for me. When we do precisely what we want to do, for the sole purpose of pleasing ourselves, it is a win/ win for all involved - objectivism vs. collectivism We have been so deceived by everyone in every place we have ever frequented - school, church, family - that selfishness won’t work and charitability does work ... for whom? All that has occurred is that those with the vested interests have essentially emotionally blackmailed us into doing for them and not for us. This can be interpreted as ‘slavery’. The guilt attached to it serves not us but those who suggest we work for them. The Protestant Work Ethic was made up by slave-owners, not slaves. “Don’t quit your day job” is a perfect example of emotional blackmail. My son is a musician; my job is to encourage him and not say, “But how are you going to support yourself?” A definition of ‘evil’ is: selling or trading our aliveness for survival. Deepak Chopra told his children: “You are meant to do whatever allows you happiness. I will always make sure you are fed and housed. Your job is to reflect the power and love and joy of your Creator by doing what you’ve been created to do.” Now, let’s attach these ideas. When we ‘work’ for anyone, including “I work for myself” , or how about, ‘self-employed’? (aren’t these great clichés to manipulate us into working but making it sound as if we are the beneficiaries?) When we ‘work’, by definition, financial compensation is the result. But what exactly is the financial compensation? NOTHING. $$$ is a very poor show of appreciation for what we do out of love, never mind for what we are not wanting to do. I know you think you receive something for your hours of labour. You do not. You receive a piece of paper with numbers on it, the date, a ‘dollar’ figure, and a signature. So far, you have received nothing of value for your labour. Now, take it over to the bank and sign your name on the back, commonly called endorsement, and lo and behold, you receive ‘money’. Nice try. There is no money. What you received are other pieces of paper with more numbers on them. Can you use them? Sort of. If you are smart, you’ll get rid of them as fast as possible, for several reasons: 1. They have no intrinsic value; notes cost pennies to make, no matter what their denomination. It costs the Feds as little to print a $500 note as a $5 note, so your dollar is barely worth the paper its printed on. 2. You are holding debt notes; debt notes carry liability in the form of interest. You will get stuck with the interest on this debt if you don’t trade them for something of value - asap; 3. As long as they are in your possession you have yet to be compensated for your labour. Since they will do you no good until you trade them, hanging onto them will not serve you. I am reminded of a Native poem: Only after the last tree has been cut down Only after the last river has been poisoned Only after the last fish has been caught Only then will you find that money cannot be eaten. Attachment to anything outside ourselves depletes our peace of mind. Can we ever detach from $$$ ? Since $$$ and its use represent the belief that we are separate and in competition with each other, if we were to change our minds about this, then $$$ would cease to exist. We simply wouldn’t need it. When we clear our personal stuff, we can go cosmic. - Barbara Marciniak Property Taxes I don’t think we have a lot of time. We must discharge the bankster’s debts for them or they will become more and more desperate. “Desperate times call for desperate measures.” If the debt that the banksters created, using as collateral the properties we are presently using and which we believe belong to us - houses, autos, our bodies, etc. - is not discharged, and only we have the lawful right, means, and energy to do this, we will find ourselves without the use of said property because we have neglected to claim it as such. Property taxes along with all other taxes will increase to the point where we can no longer afford to hang onto the property. (I recall Dr. Zhivago, upon his arrival home, discovering many families living in his house.) Never mind the mortgage, the interest, or the market; the banks/ feds will raise property taxes past the point where we can afford them and they will simply foreclose. The name of their game is to confiscate as much of our property as possible. The feds become more frantic as each day passes as the IMF tightens the screws on them. The fact that interest rates are at an all- time low ought to give one pause. Think about it: low interest rates are prompting us to buy property. 75"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"When we are all ‘indebted’ they will hike property taxes and get all ‘their’ property back - unless we know how to stop paying property tax, which is simply a case of declining to do so. Get onto it. I have written my Premier, the Finance Minister, the provincial tax advisor and none has been able to provide me with any law requiring me to pay property taxes. When I asked a woman at the Province of Alberta for an example of a ‘provincial tax’ as opposed to a ‘federal tax’, she said, “Oh, ma’am, there are hundreds of provincial taxes!”. Did this make my day, or what? .... I was seized and put into jail because, as I have elsewhere related, I did not pay a tax to, or recognize the authority of, the ‘state’ which buys and sells men, women, and children like cattle at the door of its senate house. I had gone down to the woods for other purposes but wherever a man goes men will pursue and paw him with their dirty institutions and if they can, constrain him to belong to their desperate odd-fellow society. It is true I might have resisted forcibly with more or less effect, might have run amok against society, but I preferred that society should run amok against me, it being the desperate party. - Henry David Thoreau 1854 There will always be men who will try to talk us out of our freedom . - Rice McLeod Think of the game of musical chairs. There simply are not enough chairs ($$$ to pay interest) to go around. Those who are forced to leave the game, as there is not enough money in the economy to pay back all the debt the banks have created by their expansion of credit, and profited from creating it, will lose all they have worked to accrue. It is the banks which will receive the hard asset, representing the fruits of your labour, and you have to start all over, with nothing. Who sets the interest rates in this country? The interest rate, e.g.: 6% is always commensurate with the percentage of those who will go bankrupt. The bankster’s crime of premeditated expansion of the debt beyond the amount of money in circulation will create a predetermined number of innocent victims, commensurate to the percentage of interest that the banks charge each year. Yet, banks cannot commit this crime without our giving them our signed promissory note so we can hypothecate a certain number of years of our future labour in order to use the bank’s equivalent of money, right now, in the present. Until the interest, which is being applied to the credit extended by banks, is eliminated the people will remain slaves to the ‘credit system’ which is the banking and monetary system of the world . The property will be lost - all because we have been deliberately misled into believing that it was ours and we failed to take the necessary steps to protect it, namely being sure property is in our true lawful names, and discharging the alleged debt which they have made up as a means to confiscate it. The entire process is their means to take what we think is ours for their ultimate purpose of control. This does not need to happen. It will be via our neglect. All they want is to have their debts discharged. Only we can do this for them. As long as we ‘pay for’ what we believe to be our debts with debt instruments, their debt becomes only more massive. Already they are saying it is impossible to ‘pay back’; well, of course it is impossible to ‘pay’ because there is nothing with which to pay. It is, however, so simple to discharge; it can be done in an instant. You might well ask, “Well, if they want us to discharge their debt for them, why don’t they just say so and we’ll be only too happy to comply; then we’d all be happy. Why the subterfuge?” You forget that they want the debt for the sole purpose of confiscating our property for their ultimate control. The fact that we think we laboured for it is more of the same propaganda. All property will revert back to a belligerent foreign corporation, the IMF, and where will we be after we all lose our houses and cars? Dare I say detention camps? Where else will we have to go? Properties are being foreclosed by the thousands every day. Do you still believe it is because we “lived beyond our means”? We never had to pay for any of those things we believed we ‘bought’ anyway; they were already ours. Many of us are filing the correct papers to ensure that what we believe we ‘paid for’ does indeed remain ours. This must be done. If you have not actively recorded your property (including your children and grandchildren) in your true title/name, you will lose your property (and your descendants) ; it is just a question of time. None of this has to occur. We have two ways out and I suggest you begin now to implement them. The first is to establish your property as your own and the second which is vastly more important is to practise remembering that none of this matters. What does matter is our peace of mind. We must do that which will grant us the greatest peace and the greatest joy. We must forgive those for what we think they did to us, including the International Banksters (this is blatantly the one I’m working on). We must grant our souls some freedom by knowing that house or no house, we can live in joy. Most of the people on the planet live without the houses like what we have; I’m not saying they live in joy, yet I contend they might be 76"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"able to live in joy if they weren’t incessantly reminded of how we live. They actually think we are happier than they because of the things we think we own. All minds think alike. This is classic egoistic belief in punishment. They, like the rest of us, believe they are not ‘good enough’; it only manifests in a different manner based upon their individual experiences. Remember the Grinch who stole Christmas. He was forced to realize that the people in Whoville could remain happy even after he had taken from them what he believed they required to make them happy. The joke was on him. I ask that you keep this in mind when you are forced to give up your alleged assets, which are really your liabilities as long as you let your possessions possess you, whether it be your $$$, your house, or even ..... your body. Erhart said, “The only thing I don’t have is the direct experience that there is nothing I need and nothing I don’t have.” We are already complete and whole and we don’t require the almighty $$$ for our survival and if what we are doing for ‘survival’ is what we don’t want to be doing, then we ought to recall that, from a spiritual perspective, trading our aliveness for $$$ is ‘evil’. The Holographic Mind All the energy that ever was, is, or can be, is already here. Energy is all there is. Energy is neither created nor destroyed. Our thoughts are energy; nothing else is energy since everything occurs in our minds. So, the Big Bang was the manifestation of our thought - just one thought which occurred in an instant and with that thought, we created/ miscreated the entire known universe - all at once, the entire hologram - everything. Our consciousness can go anywhere it wants and focus on anything, any time, any space, any entity that it wants. Within a hologram there is no time and no space. Herein lies our consciousness. What we continue to do is just run around in this hologram just like a kid at the midway - trying different perspectives, lives, times, places, people, etc. Great fun! What an experiment! Understanding the way the mind works is exigent. What happens is that we have a thought, rather, ‘thoughts have us’. 85% of them are negative because they arise from the ego mind which lives in fear. This is why what we experience in life seems to be somewhat negative. Thoughts are the energy which creates ... everything. Because we have senses we sense that things are not as we would like them and we strive to change the circumstances rather than change our thoughts. As Marianne Williamson said, “Changing our circumstances is like re-arranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.” What sometimes happens is that through increased information, unbeknownst to our conscious mind, we do change our thoughts, which fleetingly affords us to change our circumstances, which then change our perceptions, which then change our beliefs, which then begin to create more workable thoughts which create circumstances more to our liking. What works best is if we can release the old programming because then we are clear to create what we want. We need to stop the fear-based thinking which is so ingrained in us that we consider it natural. It is not. Collectively we have ‘created’ our world. Truth is, if we want to know what is going on in our minds, we need only observe our circumstances. If we are happy with our circumstances, we can conclude that our minds are somewhat happy and vice versa. Our circumstances follow our thoughts. Nothing is created without thought, thought is the only source of energy, energy is what it takes to create, and energy is all there is. We have ‘cause and effect’ reversed. Our belief in time and space is what keeps us from knowing real cause and effect. Our circumstances are the result of our thinking, so our judging any situation is based upon our belief that circumstances came first and our response is the result. You don’t get to vote on the way it is; you already did. - Werner Erhard Since thoughts are creative energy, we must be vigilant about how we spend our energy. Praying for things that don’t exist, i.e.: things of this world, will gets us nothing. So we pray to change our perceptions or we pray in gratitude: “it is done” (wasa). Prayers are then ‘answered’ - and so it is (espavo). I prayed for a bicycle until I realized God doesn’t work that way. So, I stole a bicycle and then prayed for forgiveness. - Emo Philips The powers that be don’t want us, whom they consider the ‘enemy’, to know their secrets. They promote each of us as the other’s competition, when in fact our opposition is way closer to home - our very own ego mind. If we continue to believe that ‘what is going on in the world’ is real and creates fear for us, we must consider that we are continuing to create it. If we want to change the world, which exists only in our own minds, we must first change our minds about the world. When we fear, we serve only the dark entities which David Icke claims thrive on our fear. When we rise above fear, they cease to exist, at least in 77"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"our minds.... and seeing as everything exists only in our minds... they will cease to exist - except for those who choose to keep them alive by paying their attention to them. We will win. We are watching a horror movie which ends well. Keep up your spirits in anticipation for the famous final scene. When we are told something over and over, as in programming and mind-manipulation, the public fool system, media, gov’t propaganda, TV advertising, TV news, satanic ritualistic cult abuse, billboards, sexual abuse, etc., with any emotion surrounding it (e.g.: the official story on the WTC demolitions) ... then the subconscious mind/ ego accepts it as true and incorporates it into its belief system. When the truth confronts us it is automatically rejected; it simply doesn’t fit into the belief system. Its like trying to file into your documents folder, two separate articles with the same title; the computer rejects the second one, even though the second file has the more accurate information (or you wouldn’t be bothering to file it). The computer is at least smart enough to request you either change the name of the second file or dump the original, which is what most people do, since the original is no longer true. But the ego mind is more tenacious than a computer because there is emotional identity behind it. Hence, we find closed-minded people who actually think they know what’s going on in the world, when in fact, its all just propaganda. Based upon this premise I offer a solution to what appears to be the sole problem of the world with the intention that once we have information about what seems to be yet isn’t, we can change our minds about it, which will empower us to change our beliefs about who we are, which will allow us to change the world, which, by the way, doesn’t exist except as a projection of our minds. Thoughts never leave their source - they boomerang. Problem - Reaction - Solution The ego mind tells us that it will solve all our problems for us. What it doesn’t tell us is that it is the cause of all our problems. Does this sound like something we’ve heard from some other entity? “I’m from the government and I’m here to help.” The ego/gov’t has a plan: 1. Create a problem; 2. Wait until their is outcry and demand to solve said problem, 3. Reluctantly agree to find a solution for said problem, the cost of which is, in some form, further erosion of our rights and/or integrity, not to mention, already in the works because this was the plan of the ego/ problem-creators in the first place. There are no problems apart from the mind - Krishnamurti Gary Renard wrote a book, based upon ACIM, which is entitled, The Disappearance of the Universe . Intuitively, I sense that those of us who are taking action based upon our knowledge of who we are, are in fact in the process of ‘disappearing’ the universe. We are stopping our projection of the ego mind and hence its manifestation of fear. Since the gov’t is only a projection of the ego mind and we are choosing to rise above it and function from a perspective of knowing who we are and treating the feds et al accordingly, we will soon cause their demise - they will cease to exist. Renard makes it very clear that as soon as we stop paying attention to low energy level mirages, they simply disappear because the only thing which allows them to exist in the first place is our attention, our energy. When we choose no longer to focus on what the PTB want us to focus, and begin to look elsewhere - towards our fellows, they will simply cease to exist. When we change the way we look at things the things we look at change. - Dr. Wayne Dyer Those who are worried about a ‘cashless society’, for example, are only keeping alive the terrifying plan of the ego’s solution for salvation. I think that it is we who will create the ‘cashless society’, which will appear scary at first, but it will come as a result of our removing ourselves from the Commerce Game. It will cease to matter to those of us who no longer choose to play the game. Mind and time are inseparable - if we’re experiencing time we are in our minds and if we are experiencing our minds we are in time. Aging is the passage of time and those who seem not to age are those who spend less time in their heads. Nothing happens without energy. The only source of energy is thought. If one feels the emotion of joy, the vibration in the body is increased and extends out and attracts similar. Thoughts are low energy, hence the vibration in the body is diminished and can alter cellular structure. It extends out and attracts similar. 78"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Psychotherapy All emotion comes from a thought which comes from an interpretation which comes from a perception of an event which comes from a projection of the mind. If we don’t see this and the emotion is negative and fails to get released, it WILL get stashed into the body part which we associate with the alleged event. Psychotherapists make ‘real’ a traumatic incident by lecturing a client on how to ‘cope’, rather than acknowledging the client’s anxiety and allowing for its release. Their purpose is to make up plans to handle various situations so the client gets stuck with ‘solutions to problems’ as opposed to being ‘empowered to create’ a perception whereby everyone wins. Too much time and talk and hence, cost is wasted by the learning of this worthless information when all that’s necessary is to be vigilant, see any and all ostensibly negative situations as the same - the opportunity to heal - and heal them in the NOW - because there is no time. Rather than many strategies which only reinforce the belief that what is happening is real, there is only one creative answer: acknowledge it, release it and forgive it. Simple, but not easy. With children, and adolescents in particular, not only will they not hear but also there exists no lecture on ‘what to do about a problem’ because there is no problem . We who employ energy psychology see clients as whole and perfect; their only need is to release the blocks to their realization of this. The ego gets a bunch of mileage/ kilometrage out of ‘psychotherapy’. Sadly, most therapies reinforce a problem by making it real and then pretend to solve a problem which never really existed except in the mind and their attempt usually involves solving it outside the mind. They encourage ‘talk therapy’ and teach coping mechanisms, further making the alleged problem real, come from a presumption that it has a past along with a cause that can be changed, and in the end there is erosion of our personal rights, when all that is required is to get the problem released. The more we put our egos onto the job, the more real it seems and the less chance there is to rid the alleged problem. Our behaviour is always the result of our emotions, which is why we do such strange things ... most of the time. We are reacting from old emotional trauma which has imprinted not only the event but also the reaction. We just keep returning to what was once upon a time a great solution to a traumatic event, yet, as adults, it no longer works. This is why I do energy work - to release trauma and ego programming from childhood. It is difficult for us to behave as adults when our responses to upsets were formed when we are very young. Since there is no new upset, except maybe war, yet keep in mind we have probably all had access to that experience within the hologram, everything is just a reminder of an older similar upset, our responses are never inventive; they are the old tapes playing over and over again. Remember Ram Dass’ book, Be Here Now . He wasn’t kidding. None of us is really here now - usually. Episodically, we might be here, yet if we are, it isn’t now, and if we are in the ‘now’, we’re probably not ‘here’. Based upon Krishnamurti’s “There are no problems apart from the mind”, all problems can be healed only within the mind, yet since our ego mind thinks that it is our only mind, it tells us that it has the answer. Yet it is the mind which creacted the problem in the first place. Talk about the blind leading the blind. In Rapid Eye Technology talking is kept to a minimum. Blinking and breathing is the way to release trauma. Imagine the hours wasted and dollars spent in therapies where the very cause of the problem is placated, pampered, and allowed to exacerbate by a therapist who has been hired to rid the problem. Since release of something that doesn’t really exist, except in the mind, is instantaneous, any more than a few hours of ‘therapy’ is redundant. People are getting fleeced into believing that their problems will take time and money to solve when in fact they are unsolvable; all that needs to occur is that they get released. This is a very brief process. But since the ego is already in charge, and we know this because of the effect it has had on us, all we are doing in consulting a psychotherapist is going along with an insane notion set forth by the ego, which is getting agreement to the idea that we have a problem. The therapist in fact does more harm than good by supporting the ego’s belief that a problem exists. Most of our problems in life clear up simply by the process of living life itself. - Werner Erhard ‘Statistics’ show that 66% of clients are cured with psychotherapy; what statistics don’t show is that 72% are cured without it. - Thomas Szasz, The Myth of Mental Illness Women handle their problems by complaining and having their friends listen with compassion. That is usually all that is required. Psychotherapists are just expensive friends. Women vent, they feel listened to, (they do not solicit advice, which men are wont to give and hence, why any woman with a brain does not tell a man her problems), they feel loved which is all any ego wants anyway, and they go home feeling much better. Those who detect that it is not so much a present day problem that is holding them up but rather something in their programming which must be dragged to the trash and a new program reinstalled, must 79"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"seek assistance with the release of the program. Energy therapies can do this. I am reminded of the joke, ‘how many psychotherapists does it take to change a light bulb? Only one but the light bulb really has to want to change.’ This honestly is true. People can not and will not become who they want to become unless there is a desire to change their minds. I’ve noticed that most suggestions to people go unheard because they don’t really want to change. “If I change, who will I be?” Most people identify with their problems. They believe that this is who they are. The ego believes itself to BE that who it thinks it is and that entity is defined by the ‘problems’ it creates. After a break-up with a man, when I was 33, my friend asked me to picture my life at age 45. She described it as perfect - career, friends, love, $$$, everything. I began to cry. She explained my tears thus: my ego dictated that in order for me to become who I wanted to be the woman I believed I was right then would have to die. My ego was actually experiencing grief over its own death. This is how I learned that I am not who my ego thinks I am. I am not my experiences, I am not my body, I am not anything. I AM. Since the part of our entire existence, of which we are conscious, is a dream, if something goes wrong, as it often does in our dreams, do we go back into our dream the following night to fix what went wrong? No, we carry on. Trying to correct something that never happened is a waste of our energy, not to mention our time, which we never had in the first place. * If you have a constant need to help other people, notice how you must keep them helpless. * Hope is what keeps all suffering in place. * Feelings of inferiority and superiority are the same. They both come from fear. Guilt/ Blame/ Punishment The object of your blame is always less of an obstacle than your decision to blame. - D. Patrick Miller There is only one disease - guilt - and it is curable. - Kenneth Wapnick The Energy Psychologist facilitates the release of guilt because all negative emotions stem from guilt. Anger, for example, is never justified. It is solely a projection of our lack of self-forgiveness. Guilt makes the world go ‘round. As soon as we all stop feeling guilt, we will stop projecting it onto others and making them pay for what we think we did. We did nothing but ‘think’. The only way to release the guilt is to forgive ourselves. Never forget that to forgive yourself is to release trapped energy that could be doing good work in the world. Self-prosecution is never noble; it does no one a service. - D. Patrick Miller I incorporate ACIM into Energy Psychology by getting to the client’s emotion allowing her to be ‘right’ about her feelings. In other words, I allow her to blame whom she thinks wronged her when really what is happening is her ego is simply projecting onto another its belief in its own guilt. Since everyone ‘out there’ is only a reflexion of oneself, I gently allow her to see that what she is really doing is blaming herself (for putting herself into that situation), then release the guilt for which she is punishing herself, then forgiving herself. Sometimes it is easier to forgive the one whom we believe has wronged us than it is to forgive ourselves, yet since everyone else is our self - we are all one - then it really doesn’t matter. Without fail though, I have seen that guilt/blame/punishment is always the issue in the final analysis, so I always treat the guilt, even when anger seems to be the cause. Once we see how our ego minds have twisted it, we can begin to forgive. “Whenever two or more of you are gathered” means that all we have to do is ‘join’ with another, ideally the one with whom we have the grievance. Forgiveness is the means to peace. I don’t attempt to undo a lifetime of ‘catholic guilt training’ in my sessions, yet I tell my clients this: Of all the patients whom I’ve ever watched as they were dying, it was the Catholics who lingered and suffered. I finally realized that although they tell a good story about their faith in God, in their hearts they are filled with a fear of God’s punishing them for the guilt that has been thrown at them their entire lives from the church. RCs are the most guilt-ridden people I’ve ever known and their manner of dying proves this. I’m sorry for those who have been terrorized by the church and I hope that they can begin to undo the damage so that they don’t have to suffer needlessly. Our belief in someone’s malady only strengthens their fear, thereby corroborating their belief that they need ‘help’. As long as we ‘fight cancer’, we strengthen it by making it real. In fact, doing anything about anything, even if it seems positive, only strengthens our belief that something is wrong. I’m not talking about doing what comes next in life. Something occurs and we do what it takes to make it the way we want it. I’m talking about the judgement that something is ‘wrong’. We make things real by acknowledging 80"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"them. We bring into existence, and/or keep in existence that which we resist simply by directing our attention to it and trying to correct it. What we resist persists. Energy flows where attention goes. I no longer complain that cancer patients won’t work with me to release the anger, grief, and guilt over their trauma. I now complain that they are not only deceiving themselves and their loved ones but also paying Genocidal Big Pharma and Medical Mafia to cause them great physical and/or financial suffering. It seems as if they believe they deserve this treatment based upon their belief in their guilt over the circumstances they created - and yet care not to mention - due to its already debilitating effect upon them. I don’t mind their subconscious declaration, “I’d rather die than face this” as there is nothing wrong with wanting to die any more than there is something wrong with wanting anything our ego minds want; it is the lack of awareness which is unhealthy. I only wish I could get my mitts on them before they go through this pretense of wanting to live. I might be able to point out to them that there is a much easier, faster, more agreeable way of dealing with their trauma than dying. There exist many energy therapies to assist them in releasing their emotional trauma surrounding an event which they can not face. Energy work is safe, quick, and does not require the patient to re-live the trauma. Trauma just energetically disappears. Cancer is not a ‘terminal disease’. That belief is a result of manipulation, as are beliefs concerning finances, education, religion, relationships, etc. I want people to stop believing nonsense, take charge of their circumstances and resultant state of health by realizing that they, and only they, were powerful enough to have created said circumstances and so they are powerful enough to create something else. My best example of Drs. Simonton’s theory was a patient I had with cancer of the larynx. What does this tell you? He believes he either said something he wished he hadn’t or didn’t say something he wished he had. So, after rapid calculation of trauma to diagnosis, I asked his wife what occurred about two years ago. “We got married.” Yikes! What’s to say to that? Then I realized that saying, “I do” is too easy to undo, ergo, not something over which to develop cancer. So I asked, “Anything else? “Well, the minute we got married his daughter quit speaking to him”.... and he had quit speaking to her. I rest my case. For years I told people, “Curing cancer is as simple as releasing the emotional trauma which caused it” and for years no one seemed interested in my assistance. I remained flabbergasted until I realized that one of the aspects of the ‘cancer personality’ is that at an unconscious level, cancer patients want to die, or they wouldn’t have developed cancer. It is their belief, thanks to medical propaganda, which causes them to think that cancer means they will no longer have to face the trauma or, rather, their interpretation of the trauma which is diminishing their basic life force. Cancer is just socially-acceptable suicide. Medical intervention does NOT cure cancer. No one I’ve ever known has ever died of cancer - only from the medical treatment of cancer. Yet, again, subconsciously one submits to the medic’s recommend- ations because in him, one has an ally in not taking responsibility. One knows she can avoid the reminder of the trauma sooner by acquiescing to the medics/ ego’s plan for salvation and dying. Since loved ones are generally horrified by the fact that the patient is dying, as they have been equally conned, they express sadness, etc. and the patient pretends, for their sakes, to want to get healthy again. Nothing could be farther from the truth. If one truly wanted to get better, she would reveal the cause of her illness, the emotional trauma which is literally destroying her; yet she rarely does. Those who do and who support their bodies in the healing process, recover. However, most take their trauma to their graves because, although initially they feel anger towards another involved in the event, they inevitably blame themselves, feel horrendous guilt over it, and wouldn’t dare tell anyone of their part in it, even when the telling would be the first step in saving their lives. I know of many people who have cured their cancer via forgiveness. The body doesn’t heal because the body isn’t sick; only the mind can heal because only the mind is sick. The body doesn’t suffer; the body doesn’t DO anything. It only does what the mind tells it to do. - Kenneth Wapnick. So, I suggest to my clients to begin, for their own sakes, the process of forgiving whomever it is they believe has caused their distress, remembering that it was only their interpretation of the situation which caused their pain, not the incident itself. Remember Krishnamurti said, “there are no problems apart from the mind.” As I say, if it is easier to forgive oneself - same sameness, because anger at another is only the ego’s attempt to hide from our conscious mind the guilt we feel and the punishment we believe we deserve. Foisting our guilt onto another might afford our egos some vindication, however, we create a downward spiral of anger/ attack/ guilt/ blame/ punishment/ anger ... ad infinitum. Anger Management classes suggest that we ought to hang onto our anger and manage it when if fact we ought to release it. Then we would no longer have it to manage . This behaviour demonstrates that we believe either: 1) causing someone else suffering will ease our own or, 2) we all deserve only suffering. The only way to end it is to forgive, absolve the guilt, and stop an otherwise endless cycle of what 81"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"doesn’t work for anyone. Ultimately, we all will be required to do this. The introduction to A Course In Miracles reads, “This is a required course; only the time you take is optional.” So, we can do it now or we can do it later. Most still haven’t truly integrated the concept that all disease is caused by the mind’s interpretation of an emotional trauma. Unfortunately, however, due to the continuous decline of nutrients in our diet for the past 60 years, not to mention an ever-increasing toxic environment, our bodies are operating in a state of starvation. The basic life force required to handle distress, formerly known as ‘living life’, is simply no longer available. Our bodies are operating at a deficit - hence, the preponderance of exhaustive immune system diseases and early aging. Nutrients from food used to provide us all we needed to bear the emotional horrors of life. Now, due to lack of nutrients, along with 75,000 environmental toxins which didn’t exist prior to 1930, the instant we interpret an event as traumatic our bodies are overwhelmed and become ill. Sixty years ago we could handle whatever came at us; now we succumb. The despondent mind slows the vibration of, and thereby restricting oxygen to, the cells which the patient subconsciously relates to the emotional trauma. Cancer cells are anaerobic - they thrive in a condition of reduced oxygen. We all know that toxins are ubiquitous in our present environment - food, air, water, clothing. So, clean that up to the extent of your ability. The one which I consider the scourge, because most are unaware of its effects, is fragranced fabric softeners. No one can heal in a toxic environment and those who are subjected to that poison are energetically out of alignment 24/7 as it is in bedding as well. I used to tell parents who asked me to work with their “ADD/ADHD” children that if they wash everything, with which the child is in contact, in a natural detergent about 9 times - this tells you how toxic this stuff is - and they don’t see dramatic improvement in the child, I will treat the child for free. They always reported an improvement. Science has discovered that our bodies require essential vitamins/minerals, essential amino acids, essential fatty acids, and now essential long-chain monosaccharides. These 8 sugars are making the most significant and dramatic difference in increasing and prolonging one’s health. The latest and greatest of the food supplements - nutriceuticals - is “glyconutrients”. No matter what your health problem, feeding your body what it requires will allow your body to heal itself. Glyconutrients are not disease-specific, as are all pharmaceuticals, so you can take them “for whatever ails you”. Bodies of cancer patients who are taking glyconutrients are healing cancer in two to four months. It is one of the easiest diseases to heal as usually only one system is involved - the immune system - and once it is up and running it can handle cancer very quickly and efficiently. The body can heal itself; the only issue is the time it takes to do so which depends upon the number of systems involved - endocrine, neural, etc. Go to: glycoscience.org. Then, if you want some, email me. Maybe when your body feels better you can handle facing the emotional trauma which caused the disease in the first place. The way to health is: 1. release the emotion surrounding the trauma; 2. exercise and oxygen, 3. nutritional supplements which the body desperately requires in order to handle toxic emotions and a toxic environment, and, 4. stay away from the Medical Mafia. Separation / Forgiveness Our interpretation of every event in our lives is based upon our previous experiences. We bring our past experiences to every perception. This is why “we are never upset for the reason we think.” We are rarely in the present. We base our every experience upon past events since this is where we go in the file (brain computer) in order to determine how to respond. So nothing is new. Ram Dass wrote in his book, Be Here Now , that if we could stay in the present, which our ego minds so loathe, we could not possibly have any upset. Our upsets are always only a reminder of something which exists only in our recollection of our pasts. Next time you are upset, ask yourself of what this situation reminds you. Now bring it forward and see how you are simply re-watching a bad movie and responding the same way. Turn off the bad movie and see it as neutral; not good, just neutral. The circumstances we create in life are solely for the opportunity for us to forgive ourselves for having ‘judged’ (generally as ‘bad’ and hence holding ourselves as the guilty party) previous similar circumstances. This is why what we deem as, ‘the same damn thing over and over’ does indeed continue to show up in our lives. The upset itself is the opportunity to take responsibility, release the emotion, and forgive the judgement. Every day I release any energy I might have on “regret of the past, fear of the future, fear-based emotions, and anything unlike love.” We all have a commitment to looking good because we think it has something to do with our 82"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"lovableness; - it hasn’t. Our perception of circumstances can cause us to override the purpose of relationship, thereby causing their demise. This is tragic demonstration that we believe there is something more valuable to us than the knowing that the living soul before us is our own self and whose sole purpose is to remind us that we can overcome any suffering we experience by joining with him/her and remembering to forget the seemingly important incident. Burt Hotchkiss, in his book, Your Owner’s Manual , describes a car collision where ‘the other guy’ was clearly at fault, very apologetic, and got his insurance company onto it immediately. For years Burt had suffered with back pain and now, this incident inflamed his back. A woman from the insurance company came to his house and asked Burt how much money it would take to “make him whole”. Burt had to remember that he was already “whole”, and what an interesting way of relating the concept of compensation. The amount of ‘money’ he could recover from this ‘accident’ was substantial; all he had to do was complete the claim form and mail it in. He spent days pouring over this form, never feeling quite right about it, however, finally did finish it up and headed for the post. He drove around the block several times considering the fact that this claim form was evidence that the other driver was separate from him. Finally, he did NOT post the form; he tore it up, and put the entire incident behind him. He awoke the next day, completely free of back pain, and never ever again experienced any of the pain which he had suffered for years prior to this ‘accident’. What an opportunity this auto accident was! How many of us can see that this sort of ostensible problem in our lives is the proverbial ‘blessing in disguise’. Its ALL up to us and our perception of it. I healed my arthritic thumb via the same process. For about 5 months I noticed that I could not lift a 1 lb. jar with my right hand without having to use my left to support it. Since I was only 45 at the time the anticipation of this being the beginning of arthritis in my hands was so frightening that I tried not to think about it and hence, didn’t do anything about it. One evening I’d had enough, I was feeling quite powerful, and so I asked myself about what I was being so ‘inflexible’, of which I had in fact been accused by a certain family member. I got my answer and after a promise to myself that I would no longer take so seriously the stand I had been taking, I forgave myself for my ‘rigidity’. From that instant on, I have had no pain or lack of strength in that thumb. Burt’s story about our all being one is obvious as it involved $$$, the grandest measure of our separateness. It separates the ‘haves’ from the ‘have nots’, the CEOs from the blue collars (and you know it has nothing to do with brains), the jet-setters from the couch potatoes, the mansions from the shanties, the Riviera from the campground, the lender from the borrower...... the creditor from the debtor. Yet, not so obvious are the every day situations in which we choose to make someone our debtor, whether it was someone’s not doing his job and thereby forcing us to do it, or someone taking advantage of us, stealing our time, effort, talent, love, - whatever, we translate it into their ‘owing’ us. Except in the case of wrongful death, we seem capable of allowing money to compensate us for whatever we feel we are ‘owed’ by the one who has grieved us. This is why there is inordinate litigation - we believe in compensation, we believe $$$ will make us whole again, restore us to who we think we are. But we cannot feel as if someone owes us without simultaneously feeling he is separate from us. Our belief that someone owes us keeps us believing in something which is untrue . THE DEGREE TO WHICH WE ALLOW ‘MONEY’ TO KEEP US STUCK IN THE CONCEPT OF DEBTOR/ CREDITOR IS THE DEGREE TO WHICH WE BELIEVE WE ARE SEPARATE. OUR BELIEF THAT WE ARE SEPARATE FROM EACH OTHER IS DESTROYING OUR LIVES. I think we feel shame over the entire concept of $$$ solely because we know at some level it is what keeps us from completely joining with another. A prenuptial agreement is a great example. ‘What’s mine is mine; what’s yours is yours’. What better way to begin a relationship, which by definition means a degree of ‘oneness’, than by declaring up front what is separate. I laugh at myself when I think that there was a time when I probably could have gone into such a contract with a straight face. I used to think that volunteering for anything was stupid. The more often I behave as if no one is separate from me, the more evidence I will gather that this is true since the results of my offering will prove it. It is spooky thought, taking every opportunity to assist others when my life matters most. But I’d always take care of myself first, because if I didn’t, I wouldn’t be capable of assisting another. So I must consider first my own well-being. Remember the oxygen masks in airplanes - put yours on before assisting another. My resultant sanity, strength, intuition, and courage will allow me more ability to be present for others. My friend, the crazy doctor, told Medicare she will no longer require their services, meaning she will treat patients who can not ‘pay’ her and she will not be submitting bills to Medicare for reimbursement . If 83"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"patients choose to compensate her in some fashion, which might mean vegetables from their gardens, or not at all, she could not care less. True, she did have other private paying patients yet she realized supporting Medicare was, in a circuitous manner, supporting gov’t benefits - which makes slaves of us all. Her ensuing peace of mind was by far greater than any funds she might receive from the feds. Declaring we will no longer charge for our services is scary, but it is something we must do if we intend to become our true selves. As long as we stay in the smallness of the Commerce Game due to fear of the repercussions of getting out of it, we will never rise above it to become the powerful living souls we are meant to become. The day dawned when to remain enclosed in a bud became more painful than the risk it took to blossom. I know that what I intend to implement will catch on, if only because people’s lives will work better. David Hawkins, in his book, Power vs. Force outlines precisely what level of consciousness, measured in energy, is required to counterbalance the lower levels of consciousness. When enough of us become enlightened (allegedly calculated to the square root of 1% of the world’s population which is just over 8,000 people), the level of consciousness of the entire universe will shift. Hawkins even states the numbers and claims that we have, in fact, already reached ‘critical mass’. ACIM states that when this level of consciousness reaches this point the manifestation of our thought energy will be the disappearance of the entire universe since as it stands now is also a manifestation of our energy. When we wake up and know that none of this is real, it is only the Matrix, it will cease to exist. Upon our awakening from the dream we will be back home in the Infinite Energy with our Creator. As yet, the only reason we have yet to experience this is because of the slow vibration of the dense physicality in which we live. It has occurred already at the spiritual level. As David Icke says, those who want to keep us entrapped in the density of the never ending matrix, what the Hindus call the never-ending cycle of death and re-birth will simply fail, which is why they are flailing in their desperation to keep us from becoming enlightened. Yet it is already done. This is a very exciting time. Very soon we will experience it. The End of the World As We Know It Why is this such a threat? I think life on this planet ‘as we know it’ is unacceptable to about 95% of the world’s population. I look forward to ‘the end of the world as we know it’. Not only does my intuition tell me that it is about to change drastically but also many other sources suggest the same thing. I used to think that the Mayan Calendar was akin to the Gregorian Calendar in that it measures the passage of time. It does not; it measures the Levels of Creation. mayanmajix.com has a bunch of info to help us understand where we’re headed and even more important, that this can be only good, better, and best news. Here’s just a brief outline of the past and next few years. Dates are approximate. 1999 - seeds of consciousness are planted 2000 - consciousness is activated 2001 - polarity is displayed 2002 - old and new consciousness collide 2003 - Truth rolls out whether we like it or not 2004 - adjustments to Truth (don’t hang on - go with the flow) 2005 - new foundations of human relations 2006 - ethical procedures are implemented 2007 - we meet our Galactic neighbours 2008 - end of manufactured lack - !!! 2009 - consciousness surpasses technology 2010 - bliss - we need to practise 2011 - we evolve to conscious Co-Creation of existence and experience ....... ....... the End of the World As We Know It . Exciting, eh? We are all faced with a series of great opportunities disguised as impossible situations. I want freedom and imperturbability more than control, security, and approval. If you think something outside of yourself is the cause of your problem, you will look outside of yourself for the answer. Do you feel fear when I say there will be an economic collapse, one of the results of which will be no SS/CP when it is our time to collect? Be certain to recognize that your fear is not about your future; it is about your belief in your powerlessness. Why would you think that there being no government-issued financial security in your future has anything to do with who you are and what you can do? If you want to 84"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"come from a powerful position, if you want others to think of you as powerful, then come from love. People perceive love as all-powerful ..... because it is. Remember who you are. You are not what you think you are; What you think - you are. Red Pritchard Inevitably I am asked, “You think you can change the world?” Well, yes and no. Yes, because the world is only a huge manifestation of my consciousness so I can change it anytime I choose. And no, because there is no world to change; it is all just a manifestation of what is going on in my collective mind. Once I change my mind and raise my level of consciousness, which Ram Dass says, “equals energy, love, light, awareness, wisdom, beauty, truth, purity” I can change what appears to be out there in the ‘world’. The Mayans state this will occur in less than eight (8) years. There are innumerable sources of this information; do not take only my word for this. I continue to discover it in every imaginable manner; I am stunned by how ‘known’ this really is. Do not expect to see this on the 11 o’clock news. This concept is anathema to the PTB and the agenda of the NWO. It serves them not; their design to keep us in fear will ultimately fail; we will prevail as long as we keep in mind that they also are a projection of our fears. When we clean up our thinking they also will cease to exist. They are only part of the nightmare which we have dreamt due to our belief in guilt. Those in our dream, the International Banksters, are simply the boogie men whom we have created to punish us for our belief in our guilt. They continue to keep us thinking we are guilty - of one thing or another - in order for them to control us. But it is we who must simply say, “NO!” It is simply a case of turning around in our dream in which we are being chased by the monster and facing it and realizing it is something we made up to scare us for the purpose of furthering our fears thereby creating a vicious cycle. If we stop feeling fear, the bad guys simply dematerialize because it is our fear which feeds them. They are only a manifestation of our fear. If we raise our level of consciousness we can no longer manifest this type of horror. They require our fear in order to exist. We release our fear and they cease to exist. We are simply watching the ugly parts of the horror movie because we know the ending is happy. It is just a question of ‘time’ - which also exists only in our minds. But we must become conscious enough to recognize this. Many are putting this entire ‘end of the world as we know it’ on the back burner - pretending it isn’t happening. This is tantamount to ‘ignore it and it’ll go away’. We must acknowledge that we are the creators of all this nonsense and just as we were powerful enough to create it we are powerful enough to create something better. Remember who you are. How do we raise our level of consciousness? By remembering the Golden Rule. Whenever I feel anger towards someone - usually a family member - as it is the purpose of everyone in my life to get me to face myself, I immediately notice that this is a result of my belief that he is separate from me and that my response to his behaviour is only the opportunity for me to forgive this belief. As quickly as possible I remember that what my ego is presently telling me is that he is separate from me and deserves punishment for his behaviour. What is true is that he is another manifestation of my consciousness and that I (the real me - the extension of my Creator, the God in me, my Spirit self) created that instant solely for the purpose of reminding me of the truth. I created it all - since it is my dream - I created people and circumstances only for my ultimate benefit. The opportunity is for me to stop my ego from telling me that the way I can save my soul is to project my guilt onto another. But: 1. there is no guilt, only my belief in my guilt; 2. there is no ‘other’, only my belief that this manifestation of my energy/ consciousness is not connected to me in any way; 3. projecting my guilt onto another - getting angry - only reinforces my belief in my guilt, thereby reducing, not increasing, my level of energy and consciousness. I am convinced that this is the biggest cause of exhaustion - physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual. The solution is to remember that I created the entire scene for the salvation of my soul and do I want to take this opportunity right now, since ‘now’ is all there is, or do I want to waste more eons of ‘time’ and energy? (There is no ‘time’, however, we do experience it in that we want to spend it in joy and not in pain.) I quickly recall that the only reason this entire circumstance exists is for me to forgive my belief in my guilt. I can take the opportunity or leave it. I grab it and remember that this ‘other entity’ is myself and how do I want to be treated? I want to be treated with love. This is the only acceptable answer. I want to feel love. How can I do this for myself ? As soon as I choose to do this, my belief in my guilt disappears. I am happier, more joyful, and I have raised my level of consciousness enough to counterbalance a bit more of the negative energy of the universe, which I have created in many other aspects (times and places) of the hologram which I created in an instant. I am now capable of seeing every single second of my day as this opportunity - this is all there is. I no 85"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"longer really have a life with a past and a future and this is the way I want it. I just continue to create opportunities for me to forgive my belief in my guilt. I have no goal other than this. I do intend certain circumstances in which to allow these opportunities to occur, e.g.: to find a friend who has this identical intention. This becomes easier for me to attract because with each forgiveness opportunity my level of consciousness increases and I am likely to attract whatever my consciousness deems significant. When our level of energy (vibration) is slow, we attract things and entities which resonate at that level. We can actually remain at a low level of energy for long periods of time which cause us to believe that the world is not good. This in turn causes us to feel despondent, which lowers our energy and consciousness even more and we continue to create low energy circumstances. This is how we got to this slow, dense, thick, heavy level of the Matrix in the first place. It continues to get thicker and the evidence is that which is going on in the world. We can change our minds and begin an upward spiral out of this mess. Yet energy must remain balanced which means that the worse it all seems to get, the better it is getting at the same time. When we raise our consciousness we change the world - except that there is no world, except in our minds. Keeping in mind that this level of consciousness is what works for those who are running the world, doesn’t it behoove us to raise our consciousness in order to shift it? We must remain vigilant, yet not react to them, and most certainly not fear them. I recall hearing Ken Wapnick years ago saying, “If you really want to change something in the world, whether it is child abuse, war, environment pollution, do your work at home - forgive your parents, your children, your spouse...” I thought he was out of his mind. I now know he is completely accurate. There is child abuse, war, pollution, etc. only because I think that the people in my life are separate from me. It is as simple as that. Apply the Golden Rule, yet know what it means; don’t accept it as religious dogma; realize it is our ticket out of this mess. We can only become wealthy by eliminating $$$ from our lives. The means to do this is to remember to do unto others as we would have them do unto us. The bulk of our behaviour is motivated by fear which is due to the programming of our subconscious mind. Unless we actively take conscious action to behave from love, we are automatically behaving due to our having been hypnotized to believe in fear. This is no co-incidence. All our programming, school, TV, print, audio, visual, news, everything is for the purpose of programming us to fear and hence to behave from fear as opposed to from love. When we feel fear we can be controlled and manipulated. Knowing this, we can subsequently know that every circumstance which our programmed subconscious mind creates is for the purpose of choosing whether to believe it as it appears or to see it as the opportunity to forgive ourselves for creating something fearful. When I forgive my father for loving me only when I work and earn $$$, the following shifts occur: 1. I realize he and his behaviour exist only in my mind for the sole purpose of forgiveness; 2. I realize that it was I who was loving me only upon the condition that I work and earn a lot of $$$; 3. My energy and consciousness both increase; 4. I remember that the whole thing is my creation for the purpose of remembering that Infinite Love is all there is; everything else is illusion. There is a story of a monk who moved into a new town and when a young girl became pregnant the people wanted to know who was responsible. She answered, “the Buddhist monk”. The people stormed his house and demanded that he financially support the child, to which he agreed. Years later the girl confessed that the monk was not responsible and so the people of the town asked him why he agreed to pay. He responded, “You requested I do this and so I did. It was just the next thing in my life which showed up for me to do; it was what was needed and wanted.” He didn’t get caught up in the meaning of it all and most certainly did not defend himself. In my defencelessness my safety lies - ACIM Thoughts left unattended are about 85% negative. If we are vigilant we can choose to think something else when we detect them. If our choice is kindness, we just saved us all much time and energy. Love is exponentially more powerful than fear. USE those close to you for this purpose - this is their sole function in your life. This is why you created them - to serve you. But they are to serve you in only one way because this is the only way any of us can function. Life is only ‘love’ or ‘not love’; there is no other option. Choose what works. I know it can be difficult to wrap one’s mind around this, however, I suggest that if you are diligent and do it as an experiment, the results will convince you. We must do this every instant - sorry, but this is the only way it will work. Take heart as, so we must breathe almost every instant also, so just incorporate ‘forgiveness’ into your perception as your means to your survival. Stay conscious. 86"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Barter Although I feel certain that we will ‘arrive’, I think barter will be the interim step. There is nothing wrong with this. The locals of Ithaca, NY use Ithaca Hours, notes which are worth ‘hours’, not $$$. The dentist’s hour is no more valuable than the chambermaid’s hour. Apparently, Cambridge Ontario is using its own currency called Community Dollars. The people of Argentina learned the hard way. The IMF stole all their property, their production, their labour, and their lives because they could no longer pay the arbitrarily increasing rate of interest on the fictitious loan. As one woman put it, after the banks collapsed, and the people returned to bartering their labour and productivity among themselves, “We just figured, if they won’t give us their money, fine - we’ll make our own.” And they did. They are now thriving on their own interest-free currency. No more poverty. They no longer have to produce three times their needs and sell two thirds of it to pay artificial interest payments to banks! They will not accept cash of any kind or even the fictitious value of gold. Barter, whether we use our own self-created currency or whether we use electronic trade credits from barter exchanges and networks is a perfect next step in our realization that we are all one because it will move us away from the FRN/BCN which are literally stealing our health, wealth, love, peace of mind, labour, production, talent, spirit ... our lives. Barter is a fabulous way to get out from under the International Banksters; the government itself uses barter and 68% of all Fortune 500 corporations are involved in barter. You think they don’t know it works? Since banking is fraud, then any other ‘alternative banking system’, e.g.: the gold standard, is still fraud. Unless, as Tim Madden says, someone out there has a quadrillion dollars to bail out the banks, we are headed for a financial collapse. If we do not have barter in place, there will be suffering. ‘Money’ is purely and simply an illusion used by the banks to steal the efforts of your production and to enslave us all. It would behoove us all to get out of the fraudulent banking system sooner than later. Barter however, still suggests a debtor/creditor relationship. We are at our happiest when we are being who we really are, whether this is lending our energy, exuding our talents, giving our time. I contend that women will be the first to get moving on this because, while men continue to compete, our nature is to be co-operative. We women can and will make the quantum leap from Nightmare to Awake ..... $$$ to Love. Peace Time is actually speeding up (or collapsing). For thousands of years the Schumann Resonance or pulse (heartbeat) of Earth has been 7.83 cycles per second. The military has used this as a very reliable reference. However, since 1980 this resonance has been slowly rising. It is now over 12 cycles per second! This means there is the equivalent of less than 16 hours per day instead of the old 24 hours. The message is to follow our hearts, our gut feelings and intuition, not our intellect. We must be discerning with the feelings and information we process. Does it resonate with us? Work towards healing the planet and self and say ‘no’ to those who wish to control us. The Mayan calendar can help free us from the time/$$$ circle, liberate the mind, and open the way to the new age beyond time and $$$. Erhard said, “When I’m enlightened, everything trains me”. I had no idea what he was talking about. We are to seize every opportunity to forgive and remember that what seems to be adverse is only to remind us of this, thereby making it easier and less time-consuming. This is what ‘relationship’ is all about and in particular with those to whom we are closest ... those who make us crazy ... those with whom we live. Tara Singh explained that prior to a chosen lifetime we know the purpose of life is to forgive and we promise that if we are given the chance to live another life we will only love and forgive. Alas, when we arrive we tend to forget our vow and live life in a manner which doesn’t work - from fear. Only forgiveness allows us truly to live. Every illusional circumstance which our programmed, subconscious mind creates is an opportunity consciously to forgive our belief in our guilt via forgiving others who are ostensibly involved. I want freedom and imperturbability more than control, security, and approval. We never do anything wrong ..... or right for that matter; we simply make choices which must be made in order to stay in the game. Our interpretation of them dictates our state of mind. The events are immaterial and irrelevant - the facts are on the moon; where we go with our choices is all that matters. Commerce itself is only a manifestation of what is going on in our minds. Everything is only a manifestation of the energy from our thoughts. We believe we are separate from each other and we believe we are separate from our Creator. The PTB are only reflecting back our beliefs. They are literally ‘laughing all the way to the bank’. Yet they are our saviours because they are teaching us, albeit brutally, in my 87"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"opinion, that we are to honour our contracts, our word is our bond, and not to make promises we can’t keep. If there is the slightest doubt in our minds about what we are entering into, we have the authority to reject any offer of contract. This applies to every area of our lives - commonly called, Learning to Say No. If we dishonour ourselves by contracting when we really don’t want to, there are serious consequences - the main one being our integrity and ethics are compromised. Since this is paramount in our spiritual growth, I say the feds are just reminding us, however harsh this generally is. If we can regard them in this manner, we can use them to improve our lives by setting our intentions higher. Again, we must listen to our intuition and not let anyone seemingly outside ourselves have any authority over us. We are not to let fear run us. No answer which comes from outside of us can have any value to us. ‘If You Meet the Buddha on the Road Kill Him’ means, have no gurus - you are all knowing. Do not take counsel from your fears. The Commerce Game is a direct result of our own projected thoughts - that we are separate from each other, from our Creator, that we are competing not only with each other but also vying for the love and acceptance of our Creator - all based upon our belief that we will be punished for ... our having separated from It. How can we separate from something that is omnipresent? One of the most glaring manifestations of this fear is that we believe there is an ‘authority’ outside our self. Our true authority is our own self, which is the extension of our Creator. There is NO authority outside ourselves. We can’t even say that God is our authority because God is not separate from us although our egos most certainly want us to think it is, solely for the purpose of perpetrating the fraud that we are alone, unsafe, unconnected. We can choose at any instant to change our minds. “Earning Our Living” How did we come to be coerced to believe that we are required to ‘earn our keep’? The movie, The Matrix states we are just batteries - the energy to fuel the pleasure of the PTB, those who never did, never will, never even thought to work a day in their lives. When one is born into slavery, one tends not to question it. Unfortunately, the Protestant Work Ethic is still alive and well, shaming us into ‘earning a living’. Many of us have had jobs/ careers which we loved, but rarely do I find anyone who is doing what he truly wants to do. The term, ‘working for someone else’ is vastly misunderstood. Everyone complains about it; few understand its gravity. Usually it is said within the context of “you’ll never get rich working for someone else”, yet it far more serious. Why would anyone do anything for someone else when it doesn’t serve oneself first? This is not about serving or not serving; this is about not fulfilling our God- given right, not to mention our God-given order to ‘BE joyful’. As extensions of our Creator, we are co -creators. All we experience, we create. With our signatures we create the funds we use to obtain what we think we want, yet this has little to do with money; it has to do with our ability, desire, right, and expectation to create. Why are we made to feel as if we have to pay for this .... or anything? I always wondered about the 144,000 mentioned in Revelations. Surely there are more than this number on the planet who consider themselves worthy of the alleged Rapture, so who are they really ? It might be the number of us who at the precise moment at which it matters, will no longer be operating in commerce. We who have put our faith in our spiritual survival will simply be able to leave our bodies when it gets too gruesome. We will already have ended our concern over our physical survival - the reason for commerce in the first place. It was the government’s sole weapon of FEAR which is what kept us playing this insidious game - chasing the almighty buck, believing it would save us. We will have removed ourselves from that which kept us bound by the rules of the Elite - those who intend to enslave us - physically, intellectually, emotionally, and spiritually. The only way to win is not to play. Success I asked myself, “What would the success of my book look like?” ‘Fame or fortune’ became my options. I realized that acknowledgement in the form of commercial success would be anathema to my peace of mind. The alternative was ‘fame’. Acknowledgements such as, “I read your book - you’re weird” would be preferable. My intention is to hear remarks such as, “I’ve rung up my credit cards - what’s the latest?”, “Your book empowered me to tell the IRS to sign their ‘offer’ under penalty of perjury.”, “I no longer charge for my art - I just love painting.”, “After I read your book, I quit my job - spooky, yet .... I’m now in control”; “I read your book - what are you living on?”, “I got a traffic 88"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"citation; I know I’m not required to pay it, so tell me how”, “I know I’m not required to pay property tax....”, “I received an offer of contract from CRA; I just told them I don’t want to contract with them ....”. Question Authority We all knew the alleged authorities had no right to tell us what to do and yet no one bothered to ask the right questions which evidenced the fact, ‘the only authority in my life is I.’ So, I ask that you question everything - in particular every time you find yourself handing over your cash for no apparent reason. Ask to see the law that requires you to do so, even more important the enforcement clause - the part about ‘what will happen if I don’t?’, and most important, the proof that the ‘law’ applies to you . Remember it only applies to the entity whose name resembles your name, which is a gov’t-created fiction designed to get you to pay what the feds ought to be paying you . Use your intuition; do not use any books, e.g.: the Bible, people, agencies, associations, etc. as your ‘authority’. None of them is real. Only your knowing is reliable. Spiritual Economics The most difficult thing we will ever have to do in life is change our minds about what we believe to be ‘truth’. For our entire lives we have been programmed, coerced, propagandized, tricked, manipulated, lied to, deceived - almost out of living life itself. We’ve all heard the many clichés, aphorisms, and quotations which suggest that we must evolve and learn. The lesson is: We are the source of all we experience. If we want to change what we think we are experiencing, we must change our minds about our perceptions. The greatest discovery of any generation is that a living soul can alter his life by altering his attitude. - William James The only thing that keeps me sane is recalling that since I made it all up, as I make up any and all of my dreams, I can change my mind about any part of it at any time. By remembering that none of this is real and none of this is really happening, except in my mind, I know that all I have to do is forgive myself for judging my circumstances, since, why judge something that isn’t really happening? Why go back into a dream the next night to fix the ‘bad parts’? The bad dream never happened except in my mind. I feel great compunction in permitting previous principle to prevent present progress - I’m willing to change my mind. How are we going to remove ourselves from a system designed not to work if we continue to do what they want us to do - slave-labour for them as they control us with their worthless pieces of paper? What will it take before we say, “Not only ‘NO’, but ‘HELL, NO!’” I think it will require great numbers of us only because we will have to change the actual medium of exchange. We must stop using Monopoly money. Most of the people I know are complaining about ‘not having enough money’. Rather than busy ourselves with second and third jobs, which is precisely what the feds want us to do because it will generate more taxes from those who don’t know that they are not required to hand it over, we must spend some time and effort on removing ourselves from such a self-defeating system. We are in a downward spiral and working more is only digging us deeper. We must begin to ‘work smarter’. This is not about attack, since attack only breeds more guilt which creates anger which perpetuates further attack. This is not about vengeance - getting them for all the distress they have caused us; this is about simply choosing no longer to play the game. When enough of us want out of a game which we cannot possibly win, the game will meet its demise, along with those who are depending upon us to continue their charade. We will be free. I understand that a very poignant question might be, “Why do we believe that our true freedom is so dependent upon money?” This is a very difficult belief to bust up, as the entire world functions, rather does NOT function, on this belief. We can only further convince ourselves that it is real by continuing to play and hence be at the effect of this. When we change our minds about the ostensible power of those who intend to destroy us and realize that we are our own power and authority we will change our circumstances. Freedom from financial tyranny and oppression will cause us to believe that we are not financially oppressed which will change our minds about our financial freedom. Finally we will see that our freedom is not dictated by the state of our finances. What is so mind boggling is that all of this is being financed by the American people themselves through their own taxes. In other words, the American people are underwriting the destruction of their own freedom and way of life by lavishly financing through federal and state grants the very social 89"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"scientists who are undermining our national sovereignty and preparing our children to become the dumbed-down vassals of the new world order. Samuel L. Blumenfeld Those whom we believe to be thugs are really just very frightened because they know the IMF can call in the loan at any time and they are frantically trying to confiscate as much cash as possible to give them. The longer they can do this, the longer they can stave off the crash, but if we don’t pay them as much as we can, the system will collapse like a house of cards. Be willing to put their minds at rest - sign over as much of your exemption as they ask. Remember, their intent is not to hurt you as much as it is to save their own skins. Have some compassion; remember - its only business. Let’s be kind to the servants and give them whatever they require - particularly when we have billions - my personal exemption is worth over $15 billion in Canada and $2.27 million in the USA. It doesn’t hurt me in the slightest to sign over $14,000 to MBNA. It is a drop in the bucket. Remember they are the frightened servants in the basement conspiring to steal the cash of the master of the house, who has so much he doesn’t know what to do with it. What we, the masters/ sovereigns, don’t want is their stealing our productivity, labour, and property. If all they need is $$$, then we can surely let them have that in the form of our exemption via a transfer instrument drawn on our unlimited credit . But if we let them intimidate and scare us into giving them our houses, shame on us for falling for their fear tactics. Lawfully Avoiding the Draft With all the angst over the allegedly imminent mandatory draft, soon to include Canadians, it is urgent that all young men and women who are waking up to the horrors of this war know that the Draft Notice, as with everything else the Feds present us, is only an offer to contract. We are free to accept it or reject it. The Feds present the rather compelling case that one is legally obliged to complete the questionnaire and sign it, but ... who said so? If we know who we are we don’t have to do anything we don’t want to do. They are pulling every trick in the book to get us to sign our lives away - literally. Once our signature is on that contract, we have only three (3) days to rescind it. Never sign any contract unless you agree completely with the terms and conditions therein. One question on this contract one signs when he registers for the draft is: Are you a US Citizen? What this question really means is: “Are you a 14th Amendment Citizen? - in which case you are a government- created, fictional, corporate entity and hence will do as we say” - as opposed to: “Are you an American National / American Sovereign? - in which case all your rights are reserved not only in common law but also in commerce”. War IS Commerce. If you were to answer “No” to that question, you would not be drafted. You, as sovereign, are always free to volunteer, but only 14th Amendment Citizens can be drafted. They are required to do what they are told to do. Why do you think the US wants the illegal aliens, in fact, everyone, to get a driver’s licence / voter’s registration card? They are contracts to become US Citizens who immediately lose any freedoms and rights they would otherwise have had as sovereign Americans. If you don’t want to go to war - and who would, knowing what that private, belligerent, foreign corporation, known as the USG, has in store for anyone who signs up? - then don’t sign the contract, the terms of which are not to your liking. Under Article 1 §10 of the Constitution, you have the right to contract and the right NOT to contract. The entire matter becomes very simple when you remember who you are. Those who go to war are each insured for 10 million dollars. The beneficiary is the USA. Family members get $600,000. The more soldiers who die, the richer become the Feds. If the draft becomes ‘mandatory’ it will be very important that you remember that you are the master and the Feds are only the frightened servants conspiring to steal the property and/ or the life of the master of the house. If you let them scare you into giving up your life, then shame on you for accepting that fear. As with any offer of contract do not go to the basement (read: ‘court’) and contract with them; do not argue with them; do not study their laws to find a loophole which allows you out of their schemes; do not mention the Constitution/ Charter of Rights and Freedoms - they can’t hear it; do not give them anything other than your firm word that you decline to contract with those who do not have your best interests at heart. Remember they are desperate; we are to be only kind to them, not to give up our lives to them. This rejection of offer to contract works with any invitation you receive - whether it is an invitation to war or an invitation to court; its all the same. They are trying to get you to contract and you want to remain free. If you remain vigilant, you can spot them coming a mile away, along with their surreptitious tactics. *** 90"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"For those of you who might have read this from the perspective of your public capacity and believe I am “giving financial/ legal advice” or “practising law/ medicine without a licence”, no doubt you have realized by now that I am practising only common sense and suggesting a better way to play the Commerce Game and better yet, no longer to play at all. For the rest of you: Remember Who You Are. EPILOGUE Two days before I left for Peru, my boys’ father received a statement from CRA as I had applied for Child Tax Benefits and CRA wanted a tax return from ‘spouse’ so I sent one, autographed By: Me, not signed by him. I wrote on the T1 form, “This is not to be construed as filing a tax return, only for you to calculate how much you owe me .” The statement read that he owed $2,490. Fortunately, I already had a binding contract with CRA Commissioner and his tacit agreement that no one is required to pay income tax (or any other tax, for that matter) so I just returned the statement, “acceptance denied for cause without dishonour to you or recourse to me for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted”, along with a copy of our contract and copied the Winnipeg office. Had I missed their offer to contract, after 3 days all offers are presumed accepted; after 7 days I would have been in default, and after 10 days they could get a summary judgement against me/him. My timing couldn’t have been better. I was in Peru 18 days; this would have been difficult to undo had I not responded when I did. If I, and/or my ‘spouse’, actually owed CRA, they would have circuitously confiscated it from me, namely via the CTB and GST refund - i.e.: the $1,200 I discovered deposited, by CRA, into my bank account upon my return from Peru. The following day, the actual day I left town, I received a letter from a ‘barrister/solicitor’ representing RBC (Royal Bank) saying, “Please pay up” and that my previous letter, in which I had requested an invoice evidencing their consideration in order to pay off the entire account, was “without legal effect”. I told him that his time to provide me with a substantiated claim had expired and that I was not a corporation. Again, just in the nick of time. I have received nothing from RBC. The barrister and I have established that he has no claim, so there is nowhere he can go with it. He knows that it would be a complete waste of his time and $$$ to file suit. I can NOT be sued. Update: Obviously the barrister reported back to RBC that he couldn't file suit and RBC got their knickers in a knot, resorted to petty larceny, and stole from my account $775.00. So, I stole it back - plus $300 for my time and trouble. I deposited MBNA and AMEX credit card cheques and withdrew the cash. So, now we are square. I sent the CEO a True Bill for the 2 hours I spent in the bank manager’s office coaching him on the banking system. I noticed that my account was about $1,100 in overdraft. The MBNA cheque was returned to me stamped ‘Account Closed’ which is not true. I settled and closed the ‘account- ing’, not the account. I’m waiting for RBC to tell me that I wrote a cheque on a ‘closed account’. So, what? I created the funds by signing it; what’s the problem? A Promissory Note is a Promissory Note is a Promissory Note. Why do they insist upon our using IMF notes when my note, according to the Bills of Exchange and Bank of Canada Acts, is equally good. If they refuse my tender then the debt is discharged. They’ll whine they didn’t get ‘paid’ and this is why my account was debited. Who ever gets ‘paid’? No one can get paid until they supply us with something with which to ‘pay’ unless we use our exemption which, being an asset, not only ‘pays’ them but also exempts them from paying tax on liability funds. Since they still have my cheques they must be using my exemption to enrich themselves at my expense. Mysteriously my account was balanced to zero which means they did an EFT of $1,100 credit - evidence that they do this electronically on a whim. Then they closed my account. What are they smoking? CRA/CTB told me they wanted a refund from me for an overpayment of $454. Knowing that if I told them “Acceptance denied for cause.....” they would confiscate it from my CTB so I wrote them a transfer instrument for the $454.00 and on the next statement they noted the “non-negotiable cheque” was credited to the account rendering the debt on the account as paid and the balance zero. The cheque was in the amount of my usual monthly benefit with no deductions. So, CRA accepted my transfer instrument. I’ll say it again; when creditors get vicious or if you have something to lose by not paying them .... quit fighting and just ‘pay’ them - with your exemption - not your labour. You have billions - it won’t hurt you to be generous. Would you feel compunction about drawing up a contract with your domestic servants? No? Then why would you feel any compunction about drawing up a contract with your federal servants? Fear? Lose the fear; remember who you are and you’ll be able to do anything you want to do. I wouldn’t be having this much fun if I were ‘gainfully employed’ and if I did not know that all banking is fraud. 91"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"SUMMARY 1. The name on any ‘charging instrument’, e.g.: traffic tickets, tax bills, statements, loans, lawsuits, debts, etc. is not your name . It is the name of a government-created corporation, cleverly disguised, in upper case letters, by the bureaucrats, to resemble your name. Do not blow off this fact. It is to deceive you into believing you are liable for its debts. You are not. Check the name on any government-issued ID you have. Your name is not on it. By the way, this applies also in reverse: what you think you ‘own’, e.g.: your house, because you think it is in your name, is not in your name, ergo, you do not own it . The Commerce Game was set up by the Global Elite/World Bank to confiscate your funds and property in order to make economic slaves of the entire population of a New World Order under their complete control. 2. The only law in existence today is Contract Law. What you think of as ‘laws’ are only statutes and do not apply to you; they apply only to corporations. If you have no contract with the entity from which you receive a charging instrument, you are not financially liable ... and ... you couldn’t possibly have a contract because corporations cannot lawfully contract. What you signed was a unilateral, and hence, unenforceable contract. All Law is Commerce; All Commerce is Contract; No Contract - No Case. There is not one government agency, department, or ministry in the world that can prove that you must pay what we have all been indoctrinated to believe we are ‘bound by law’ to pay. Do not fall for this incredible deception any longer. Your ticket to financial freedom is to REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE . 3. The only way out of this mess is to remove ourselves from the Commerce Game - completely - so that we are no longer dependent upon entities whose sole agenda is to control and destroy us. The only way to win is not to play. Cash compensation is not a ‘win’; we can create for ourselves all that is way bigger and better - love and light, peace and joy, compassion and forgiveness - that which we were meant to Be, Do, and Have. By remembering who we are we will learn to do what we love to do and serve ourselves by serving others, thereby leaving the banksters completely out of our new way of life. It is happening. Be the change you want to see - Mahatma Gandhi Namaste I honour the place in you in which the entire universe dwells. I honour the place in you which is of love, of truth, of light, and of peace. When you are in that place in you and I am in that place in me ~ we are one. *** 92"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"All behaviour unlike love is motivated by our fear of punishment based upon our inaccurate belief in our guilt.
