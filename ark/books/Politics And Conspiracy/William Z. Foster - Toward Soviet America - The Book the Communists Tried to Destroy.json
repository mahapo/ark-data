But the Communists themselves suppressed it; and, for all its fame, only a handful of Americans have actually seen the Foster work.

There are, however, additions: the story of the book, the story of its author, and comments on the chapters. It was in 1932 that TO WARD SOVIET AMERICA first made its appearance.

The 1932 copyright expired, and the original pub- lisher neglected to renew. Af ter an appropriate interval, the present enlarged edition is being brought out under a copyright of its own. When TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA was written, Wil- liam Z. Foster was an open, admitted Communist. He was, in fact, the National Chairman of the Communist Parly of the United States of America. What Foster said in this book was said by the highest official of American Communism. Moreover, his every word had Moscow's approval, or he would not long have re- mained at the head of the Moscow-directed American Communist apparatus. But he did remain National Chairman for many years, so he must have obeyed faithfully all the while. A dedicated Communist to the end of his life, William Z. Foster, since 1957 Chairman Emeritus of the Com- munist Party, USA, died in Moscow, of natural causes, on the first day of September 1961. In a massive state funeral, his ashes were deposited in the Kremlin itself. That made him the third \"American\" to achieve this dubious distinction: John Reed and Big Bill Hayward had preceded Foster in similar propaganda entomb- ment. Later, however, Foster's remains were removed to Chicago. A cynical Kremlin thus publicly honored its Amer- ican branch manager for forty years of service. The hollow mockery of a state fu neral suited the purposes of the Communist International. It was tossing a crumb to its people in the United States. For the American Communist Party is simply a chain-store retail outlet iv"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"FOREWORD for a global wholesaler of espionage, sabotage, sub- version, and revolution. William Z. Foster put the text of TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA on paper. The book's real author was Karl Marx, with the collaboration of Nikolai Lenin and Josef Stalin. It is the poisonous ideas, and the destruc- tive plans, of Marx and Le nin and Stalin, not merely those of Foster, that make this book so meaningful and so frighteningly authentic. For TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA disclosed exactly what those geniuses of evil planned for this country under the hammer and sickle. The plan has not changed. TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA still reveals what your fate under that symbol of slavery is intended to be. The Foster blueprint for conquest was written when the Communist line was \"hard.\" The masters of the worldwide conspiracy sought openly to Communize the earth by force. TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA is, quite literally, a handbook of violence. A little later, however, the line changed (as the Com- munist line continually doe s). Because the schemers who run the Red International thought it would accom- plish their aims more effectively, a \"soft\" policy was adopted. Instead of battering down our ramparts from without, victory now was to be achieved from within. Trojan Horse tactics would be employed. In the face of this altered strategy, a book that advo- cated violence became a liability. Obviously, TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA had to be swept under the rug. More to the point, it had to be obliterated. Cartago delenda est. That is why, for years, the Kremlin's agents, includ-"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"FOREWORD ing those in its American s ection, have been striving to expunge this hook from the record. Copies have been hidden. They have been destroyed. They have been burned (oh, yes: Communists burn books — just like their counterparts, the Nazis). But really indicative of Communism's grim determi- nation to wipe out TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA is the fact that, in a relentless year-after-year campaign, the hook has been systematically stolen from the shelves of public and private librarie s. The object: to keep it out of the hands of American officials and the Amer- ican people. This campaign of illegal extermination has been un- believably thorough, and unbelievably successful. A§ an unintentional result, the original TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA has become a collector's item of no mean worth. The very few copies still extant in libraries are kept (or ought to be) carefully under lock. Even the original publishing house no longer can find a copy of its own hook in its own library. (Most of that publishing firm's other records and files con- cerning the Foster book have vanished mysteriously, too.) In the memorable Smith Act trials of leading US Communists some years ago, the principal charge was conspiracy to teach and advocate the overthrow of the United States Government by force and violence. And there simply couldn't have been a piece of evidence more likely to nail down the case against the Commu- nists than Foster's TOWA RD SOVIET AMERICA. From first page to last, it is an order for force and a demand "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"FOREWORD for violence. Accordingly, the Department of Justice put out what journalists like to call a dragnet — and could only locate a handful of copies in the entire United States! Fate decreed that one of the twelve top Communists due to face trial in the first Smith Act case was William Z. Foster. And of course Foster had written the very book the Government wanted to use as evidence against him. However, Foster pled serious heart trouble. He was allowed to slip off the hook when his doctors insisted he probably would not live through the rigors of a long trial. He lived another thirteen years. During the trial, with Foster abed at home, United States Judge Harold Medina sent a court representative to ask certain questions. The invalid was required to answer them under oath. In his replies, Foster admitted that the Communist line wriggles like an eel. As far as the official Red posi- tion, at the time he wrote TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA, was concerned, he provided the court with a beautiful sample of Communist double-talk: \". . . we understood that to propose a Socialist Gov- ernment as the alternative to Capitalism would surely be met by the most extreme violence on the part of the capitalists, and we proceeded to warn the people ac- cordingly. . . .\" Translated, that Aesopian language goes something like this: \"When a Communist mob sets out to seize the gov- ernment of a given country, and sheds blood in the "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"FOREWORD process, this is not overth row by force and violence. Communism always proceeds peacefully. But if the more responsible citizens are so foolish as to oppose that takeover, and people are killed and property de- stroyed, why, Communists are not to blame. It's those selfish, greedy Capitalists: they shouldn't have resisted. They employed the force and violence. Therefore, they are the guilty ones. So they are the ones who must pay.\" Here was one of the most staggeringly dishonest arguments in the whole Comm unist arsenal of lies and distortions: this perversion about poor, peaceloving Communist conquerors having to defend themselves against inexplicably resisting victims. Lenin himself had warned that the \"ruling cl asses\" never would §urrender their power voluntarily. In other words, the capitalist system, the system of free enterprise and free men, must permit itself to be wiped out without even putting up a fight! Lenin said the \"ru ling classes\" would resist. And, he went on, the more the owners of property re- sist, the greater the violence they compel Communists to use in crushing them. Lenin's twisted rationalizati on has persisted. In the new Communist Manifesto pr oclaimed on the sixth day of January, 1961, Nikita Khrushchev declared: \". . . if the ruling classes counter revolution with force and are unwilling to bow to the will of the people, the proletariat must break their resistance. ...\" With that brutal statemen t in 1961, the circle was complete. World Communist strategy was back where it was in 1932, when William Z. Foster wrote TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA. The hard line under which he wrote it had given way, about 1935, to a soft one. Now the soft has given way, in its turn, to the hard. Force and violence again are the order of the day. As a matter of fact, Khrush chev boasted in that Jan-"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"FOREWORD uary speech that the new-old program was entirely official: \"The path to Socialism lies through proletarian revo- lution and the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat.\" (What we call Communism, Communists call Socialism. They like to think that true Communism is so exalted a condition it cannot be attained until after Communism's preliminary, Socialism, has been utterly perfected. Only then, according to the high priests of Marxism, will a Communist become a Communist.) Judge Medina's official asked the ailing Communist Chairman about TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA. William Z. Foster thereupon publicly renounced the book that was embarrassing world Communism. He said TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA was obsolete; it \". . . no longer represents the tactical line of our party and is not used in any sense as an indicator of present policy.\" Foster could orphan his book, but he could not wipe out what it reveals about Communism. With the revival of the era of force and violence, TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA once more has come into its own. Again it fits the international Communist line. And again it threatens the United States with the stark horrors of becoming a conquered province, under the bayonets of a Red Army. The Communist line changes often. The Communist purpose — to conquer the world — does not change at all. William Z. Foster was born in Taunton, Massachu- setts, in 1881. He was one of twenty-three children, all the progeny of the same mother and father. At ten, the boy quit school and went to work. He knocked about ix"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"FOREWORD the country for a quarter-cen tury before settling into a rut of Leftist leadership. When he was nineteen, in 1900, Foster formally be- came a Socialist. What he joined, incidentally, was the genuine Socialist Party, not a Communist Party wear- ing a Socialist label. The Socialists ejected him eight years later on the grounds that he was too Radical for them. Foster moved to the still more Radical IWW (Inter- national Workers of the World). In 1912, at the age of thirty-one, he was out of the IWW and founding the first of various small independ- ent labor organizations he would try to launch. Most of them failed. But Foster was stubborn. By 1917 he was a member of an organization he had once fought bitterly: the American Federation of Labor. Here he discovered that he was a talented labor organ- izer, after all. Within a year he had unionized two hundred thousand meat-packing employees. Within two years he was leading four hundred thousand steelwork- ers in a colossal strike. William Z. Foster built himself a reputation. In 1920, Foster was out of the AFL and occupied in putting together another of his labor independents. This time it was the Trade Union Educational League (TUEL). He was not a Communist. But the Communists had their eyes on him. Only a year earlier the country's extremist Radicals had come together to create, for the first time in this country, a recognizable Communist movement. It needed numbers, and it needed leaders — especially labor leaders who knew how to organize. In a word, the new Communis t groups needed William Z. Foster. In Chicago, Foster learned that Moscow was drawing together a worldwide organization for far-Left trade "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"FOREWORD unions. In 1921 he went to the USSR — as an observer. When the international labor network (it was called, for the sake of convenience, the Profitern) was brought into being officially, Foster was watching. He could en- vision vast horizons in the United States for a man like himself, with a world labor organization behind him. Always the opportunist, William Z. Foster let it be known that he could be persuaded to join the US Com- munist Party. There was, however, a condition. He would join only if the Kremlin would build its Amer- ican operations around his TUEL. The Kremlin was willing. A bargain was struck. How- ever, Foster insisted upon a few subordinate clauses. For instance, he demanded that there be no public an- nouncement of his conversion for several years (and there was none, until 1923). As a result of another of Foster's ideas, Moscow was obliged to make it plain to the heads of the youthful American Communist appa- ratus that labor henceforth was to be as important as all the rest of the organiza tion's activities put together. It was further decreed that , while political headquarters might remain in New York, a parallel, co-equal head- quarters for Communist labor operations was to be opened in Chicago. Naturally, it would be under the command of newcomer Foster. More or less concurrent with Foster's advent into Communism, there was a merger of the two nationwide branches of the American movement — the Communist Party of the United States, and the Communist Labor Party. Together, they called themselves the Workers* Party. In 1924, a brief year after Foster had made public the fact that he was a Communist, he was named as the Workers' Party candida te for President of the United States. "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"FOREWORD Though he tried five successive times to hoist the hammer and sickle over the White House, William Z. Foster never entertained the faintest idea that he could become the duly elected President. He knew how he could become the Communist dicta- tor of the United States, though. He told all about it in TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA. In 1923-1924, not long after Foster joined the Com- munists, an Austrian fanatic behind prison bars in Ger- many was busily scribbling a book. It was called MY STRUGGLE — or, as it is somewhat better known, MEIN KAMPF. For all its literary faults, MEIN KAMPF is one of the most important books ever written. For it revealed, in detail, exactly what Adolf Hitler intended to do. At the time of publication, a single minor official who read MEIN KAMPF and believed it could have stopped Hitler before the ex-corporal grew strong. Such an act would have prevented World War II; would have kept such ghastly names as Auschwitz, Belsen, Buchenwald from defiling history's page s; and would have saved human lives by the million. But no one believed. No on e acted. Even after the power-mad house painter began his rush to heights from which he could threaten the whole world, Western statesmen paid no more a ttention to Adolf Hitler's book than if it had never existed. Yet there it was, in black and white — the outline, the statement, the whole in- credible future as Hitler planned it. (One terrible result of this negligence toward Hitler, among countless terrible results, is that it put the Soviet Union in a position, after World War II, where it could"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"FOREWORD thereafter play Russian roulette with civilization itself.) The book you hold in your hand — TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA — is the American Communist MEIN KAMPF. In 1932, the fateful volume put the United States squarely on notice. Never again could this nation say it hadn't known what Communism had in store for it. America was warned by Foster exactly as Europe was warned by Hitler. It is all here, between these covers. We are told that the Communist International is work- ing to overthrow our Government. We are told how this is to be accomplished. We are told what is to hap- pen, after that, to our nation, our society, and ourselves. Foster's TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA is not simply a book; it is a roadmap to Terror. In 1957, Foster, a sick man, was pushed aside. One of the toughest Communists ever to give orders took over the direction of the conspiracy in the United States. This was a Moscow-trained, bred-in-the-bone revolu- tionary born Arvo Mike Hal berg, hut calling himself Gus Hall. Gus Hall became General Secretary of the Communist Party, USA. Foster was give n an honorary title (Na- tional Chairman Emeritus), and, as the new National Chairman, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, an antedeluvian party hack, became the first woman to preside over the Communist conspiracy in this nation. A man more appropriate to a hard Communist line than Gus Hall would have been hard to find. Said FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover of Hall's ascendancy: \". . . an energetic, coldly calculating, aggressively pro- Russian ex-convict now is directing the visible forces which are dedicated to the destruction of individual "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"FOREWORD freedom in America. Gus Hall is an utterly ruthless Communist. He believes that the ends of communism justify the use of any means to achieve those ends.\" Where does the loyalty of such a man lie? Even before the swing hack to a get-tough policy, Gus Hall had testified: Q. But you would prefer . . . to be in Russia? A. I prefer America with a Soviet government. Q. Are you willing to fight and overthrow this gov- ernment? A. Absolutely. Q. And you are willing to take up arms and over- throw the constituted authorities? A. When the time comes, yes. Gus Hall meant it, too. He is a throwback. He be- longs to Communism's Neanderthal wing: the Com- munism of brass knuckles and shortened baseball bats. Hall is ideal for the job — if it is a tough job that requires a tough man to handle it. Communist boss Foster did not merely want the workers of this nation to arise. His dangerous text advocates merciless revolution. The book calls for the complete and final destruction of the United States as Jefferson, Franklin, Adams, and the rest conceived the country . . . and as we are fortunate in knowing it. According to the book, overthrow would be followed by still more force and vi olence. A permanent Red Terror would be imposed. Private property would be abolished; schools turned into vast vats for brainwash- ing; churches boarded up; whole skyscrapers emptied of their lawful tenants and handed over to the \"prole- tariat\"; private automobiles and private watercraft "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"FOREWORD taken from their owners and given to a new aristocracy shoved up from the bottom; social and fraternal organ- izations crushed; the well-to-do as well as the wealthy stripped of every possession even before being exter- minated . . . and. as rapidly as possible, the United States of America turned into the United Soviet States of America, a distant and enslaved province of the all-victorious USSR. The Kremlin, global headquarters for the interna- tional Communist conspiracy, is wholly convinced that it shall have its Soviet Amer ica. Nor does Moscow great- ly care whether the US is conquered by a \"hard\" method or a \"soft\" one; whether victory is won by force and violence or achieved through subversion. Foster's book tells what will happen if the takeover is accomplished through force and violence. Would the result, for America and Americans, he any different if this country fell to Communism the \"soft\" way? No, it would not. Freedom still would be wiped out. The bourgeoisie — the vast mi ddle echelon — still would be crushed. Private property still would be seized. Capitalists (and to Communism a Capitalist is not neces- sarily a man of great wealth) still would be shot. Re- ligion still would he stamped out. Children still would be torn from their parents, to be brought up as Red zombies. Slave camps still would flourish. Women still would be turned over to the victors. Iron dictatorship still would be imposed. Worst of all, there would be no hope. For there would be no one, anywhe re, to rescue us. That is why TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA is every bit as important today as it was when first it appeared. There was a time when the international Communist line called for openly naming Communism's objectives, openly stating how Communism proposed to achieve "},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"FOREWORD them, and openly boasting about what was to happen when Communism was victorious. William Z. Foster wrote the book in that time of arrogance. The time of arrogance is hack. . . .

The masses are beginning rightly to sense that Commu- nism has an important me ssage for the human race, and they want to know what it is.

Foster, was that Capitalism is doomed. This is the burden of the chapter that follows. And if Capitalism goes, what is to replace a system under which the world has prospered since the end of feudalism? Why, say s Foster, Communism. If this chapter does not quite get into the ugly story of a Communist America, it has an adequate unpleasant- ness of its own. It tells what Communism thinks is wrong with Capitalism — the free enterprise system. And it passes judgment. Capitalism, intones the open- ing chapter solemnly, \". . . is sentenced to death as a social order.\" However, like good busin essmen, Foster's interna- tional Communist co-conspirators believed in insurance. Not only did they count upon the \"decline and decay\" of Capitalism, and its \"final dissolution\", as something ordained by the God they said does not exist; they also sought to hasten the end of the system by \"revolu- tionary overthrow\". You can't be much more practical than that. But why does Communism want to destroy Capital- ism? For humanitarian reasons, is the pious Communist reply. As William Z. Foster puts it in the opening chap- ter, Capitalism \". . . does not carry on production for 1-A"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"1-B NOTES ON CHAPTER 1 the benefit of society as a whole but for the profit of a relatively small owning clas s.\" In other words, it is wrong for the man who takes the big financial risk to expect some of the benefits — small as they are, after taxes. Furthermore, to operate in the hope of a profit \". . . generates the whole series of contradictions and conflicts — economic, political and social — which torment present day society, causing disruption in the economic life and violent struggles between individual capitalists, between social classes and between capitalist States.\" Communism's remedy is simple: Cut everything down to a dead level. Let there be no individual initia- tive (and, in fact, no individualism), no social classes (and very little of man as a social being), no independ- ent nations (and positively no independence). Inasmuch as Foster's book paraphrases Communist scripture, it might be well to see what the cult's holy men themselves have said about the evil thing, Cap- italism. In the first half of last century, a poverty-ridden, hate- filled German expatriate in London unknowingly per- petrated the greatest and crudest hoax of all time. His name was Karl Marx. He gave us the unrivaled catas- trophe called Communism. Marx was an unmitigated crackpot. Collecting the ill-assorted arguments of He gel and dozens of others, the untidy eccentric concocted a quack \"science\" as vicious as smallpox, and just as quick to infect. Karl Marx thought his rag-hag \"theory\" (he called it, sometimes, \"scientific Socialism\") proved that his- tory has been nothing more than the record of strug- gles between classes of society; that classes merely divide men into oppressed and oppressor groups; that "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"NOTES ON CHAPTER 1 1-C it is possible to point out certain \"laws\" governing such struggles; that these \"laws\" force history to move along paths from which it cannot deviate; and that the whole progress of history inexorably leads to, and reaches its climax in, Communism. So Marx proposed to turn the world upside-down. The lowly laborer should be elevated to the top of the social structure. The powerful Capitalist should be pulled down from his height. Even the smallholder on the ladder's middle rungs must be tumbled from his place. Nor did Marx want to stop there. He maintained that the rich as well as the middle-income propertyholders must be eliminated altogether. The crime was owning something. To Karl Marx, the blackest villain of history is the man who possesses private property: the bourgeois, the despised Capitalist. The hero is \". . . the proletariat, the modern working-class ... a class of laborers, who live only so long as they find work, and who find work only so long as their labor increases capital. These laborers, who must sell themselves piecemeal, are a commodity, like every other article of commerce. . . .\" Thus Marx and his co-theorist, Friedrich Engels, in The Communist Manifesto (1848). Just in case you missed the point, they remind you that \", . . The prole- tarian is without property. . .\" However, they intend to remedy that. W ith your property. The working-man, says the Manifesto, is to fight a \". . . more or less veiled civil war, raging within exist- ing society, up to the point where that war breaks out into open revolution, and where the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie lays the foundation for the sway of the proletariat.\" Or, as Marx and Engels put it, soon thereafter:"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"1-D NOTES ON CHAPTER 1 \". . . the immediate aim of the Communists is the for- mation of the proletariat into a class, overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy, conquest of political power by the proletariat.\" So, \". . . the theory of the Communists may be sum- med up in the single sentence: Abolition of private property.\" Farther along in the Manifesto, the penniless Marx and his wealthy collaborator, Engels, drive the Com- munist nail home. They speak for all Communists: \", . . you reproach us with intending to do away with your property. Precisely so; that is just what we intend.\" Marx saw property as the root of all social, political, and economic evil; kill the root and the evil dies. The profit system — that is to say, Capitalism — is going to come crashing down in ruins one day, prom- ised Marx, because of its \"inner contradictions\". The bad guesses of Karl Ma rx about Capitalistic so- ciety set an international record of some sort. But the cunningly practical Communist bosses who came after Marx — the men whose job it was to make woolgather- ing Marxism work — were smart enough to pretend that The Master was always right. The Satan-faced little fanatic who called himself Nikolai Lenin, a hundred ti mes cleverer than Marx, was chief among those who kept the founding father on his pedestal, even when th ey were aware that Marx had set out to build a house and had wound up with an insane asylum. Lenin retained the form, but he changed the content. Propping up the roof, he gradually re- moved the old floors and the old partitions and ceilings, and substituted new ones. All that remain of the house "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"NOTES ON CHAPTER 1 1-E that Marx built are exterior walls and the roof. Lenin's remodeling job was explained by Doctor Gerhard Niemeyer, professor of political science at Notre Dame University, in his \"The Communist Mind\". Where Marx said the exploiters are greedy factory- owners, Lenin expanded that to wealthy nations. Where Marx said the exploited are industrial workers, Lenin broadened it to colonies. Where Marx said the mark of bondage is the spectacle of a man selling his labor- power on the commodity market, Lenin said bondage is the political control of territory and the economic control of markets. Where Marx condemns the hated factory-owning Capitalist for making a profit from his employees' labor, Lenin enlarges him into a black- hearted international financier who makes a profit from entire nations. In short, Marx created a philosophy, Lenin converted it into an organization, Stalin made the organization a striking-force for world conquest, and Khrushchev sent it into open aggression against the Free World. In this initial chapter, F oster happens to refer to a number of things that were going on in the United States at the time he was wr iting. Instead of sounding like events of 1932, they might, instead, have been occurring no later than th is morning. There is the matter of an approaching Federal deficit (two and a half billions of dollars). The \"Chinese Soviets\" are big and getting bigger. Military hardware is piling up.

A Congressman tells the House of Representatives that the American people \"are right up against Com- munism.\" The New York Times, in what must be a stick of standing type, remarks lugubriously, \"Western civil- ization has begun to look furtively around, listening be- hind it for the silent tread of some dread specter of destruction.\" The World Congress for Social Planning bemoans the shortcomings of Capitalism while rhap- sodizing over the superiority of the Soviet system. The United States is accused of being \"the most powerful and ruthless of imperialist powers.\" Communism de- cries US investments in Canada, Latin America, Asia, and Africa. There has been an international \"raid on the dollar\", menacing the American gold supply. Fas- cism in the United States, according to Comrade Foster, is just around every corner. The Soviet Union has be- come a \"deadly rival\", destined to outstrip the USA in everything at practically any moment. Communism has gobbled up \"one-sixth of the globe\". The US suffers an international \"loss of prestige\" because of \"the great advance of the U.S.S.R.\" Am erica is warmongering, par- ticularly where the Soviet Union is concerned. There are futile disarmament conferences, futile peace con- ferences, and futile conferences about conferences. The starry-eyed international organization — called, then, the League of Nations — in which countries are sup- posed to chirrup together like happy birds \"is not a peace-striving institution, as the capitalists and their Social Fascist flunkeys woul d have us believe.\" \"New and hideous weapons are constantly being devised. . . .\" Pacifists are saying that wh en war does erupt, the very first bombing will bring \"civilization ... in something like half an hour, to a close.\" In Southeast Asia there is \"fiercest terror, mass s hootings, the annihilation of whole villages\" in guerrilla warfare.

Our enemy simply is not Communism as Karl Marx constructed it. It is only barely Communism as Lenin rebuilt. It is not altogether Communism as it was changed by Stalin. Even Khrushchev's Communism is a name rather than a fact. In place of the vaporings of the false prophet Marx, we have something far, far older than Communism in any of its forms. The foe that now confronts us is as old as man. It is nothing more, and nothing less, than a stark, brutish, cave-man lust for power. Moscow long since ceased to be the center of \"sci- entific Socialism\". It has become GHQ for a global army of deceit: carefully trained soldiers without uniforms, masters of espionage, riots, Fifth Column operations, guerrilla tactics, blackmail, Trojan Horse methods, sabotage, psychological warfare, revolutions, conspir- acy.

Throughout t h e capitalist world, without exception, the picture is one of increasing chaos and crisis. The capital- ist, industrial system is paralysed as never before. Tremendous masses of workers are thrown into un- employment and destitution. The standards of living of the producing masse s have declined catas- trophically, mass starvation existing in every capi- talist country, including th e United States.

Capitalism is manifestly in serious crisis. On the other hand, the S oviet Union, born in the midst of the capitalist wo rld slaughter of 1914-18, presents a picture of growth and general social advance. The Russian i ndustries and agriculture are expanding at an unhea rd-of rate, the Soviet Union being the only country in the world not pros- trated by the economic cris is. The masses of pro- ducers of factory and farm are all employed; their standards of living and culture are rapidly rising. They are building a new and free proletarian de- mocracy. In short, as cap italism goes deeper and deeper into crisis, the Soviet Union forges ahead faster and faster upon every front. The meaning of all this, as will be developed in the course of this book, is that the capitalist system is in decline and is histor ically being replaced by a new social order, Social ism. Capitalism, based upon the private ownershi p of industry and land and the exploitation of th e toiling masses, has ex- hausted its social role; the revolutionary forces, under the leadership of the Communist Interna- tional, are gathering to sw eep it away and to build in its place a social sy stem based upon the com- mon ownership of the m eans of production and the carrying on of production for social use.

We are living in the histori- cal period of the revolut ionary transition from capitalism to Socialism. The Present Economic Crisis L IKE a tornado the present ec onomic crisis struck the capitalist world. It is a crisis of over-produc- tion. The first signs of th is threatening over-pro- duction manifested themselves in Germany and central Europe generally in the latter part of 1928. The industrial decline began in the U. S. towards the middle of 1929, follo wed by the great October Wall Street crash, afte r which every capitalist country was swiftly drawn into the vortex. The inevitable result is the worst economic crisis, by far, in the whole history of ca pitalism. It is the deep- est, the most far-reaching and the longest. Every branch of industr y, every capitali st country is affected. Only the Soviet Union is immune. And as Stalin says, \"The cris is has struck deepest of all at the principal country of capitali sm, its cita- del, the U.S.A.\" The crisis is setting in motion forces that threaten the ve ry existence of the capi- talist system. Statistics constantly pile up to indicate the en- tirely unparalleled severity of the economic crisis. In industry the drop in production has been catas- trophic and, after 30 mont hs of crisis, it still de- clines. Production in th e basic industries has "},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"4 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA fallen more than 50% be low 1929 levels and more than 30% below 1930. Steel has dipped to 20% of capacity and \"even order inquiries for tacks are seized hopefully.\" Building is off about 70% since 1928, notwithstanding \"emergency\" building pro- grams, etc. In 1931 Amer ican exports declined about one-third, or $1,418, 000,000. The total na- tional income fell from 89.5 billions in 1929 to 52.4 billions in 1931, or 41%. The drop in wholesale prices, 24% between 1929 a nd 1931, is wholly un- precedented, the previous record being 7% in the crisis of 1873-75. New fi nancing decreased from 6 1/2 billions in 1929 to 2 1/2 billions in 1931. The general business index, at this writing registering 60, a drop from 113 in Aug., 1929, is the lowest in American economic history, the nearest low to this being 72 in 1894. Internationally there is a similar picture, world production levels at this time being about those of 1913. According to League of Nations' figures, world trade has fallen off 40% from the Spring of 1929 until the end of 1931, a decline entirely with- out precedent. 1 In England production is at 65, or far below pre-war levels . In Germany, says the German Institute for Busi ness Research, \"Indus- trial production is about as large as it was in the years 1900-03.\" Production in France has dropped 20% since the mi ddle of 1930.

The Balkans are deep in crisis, Japan's industries have been similarly paralysed. Unemployment has developed internationally upon an unheard-of scale. In Great Britain there are 3,000,000 unemployed, in Germany 6,500,000, in France unemployment regi sters an all-time rec- ord, and in the United States over 12,000,000 are unemployed. There are almost as many more part-time workers. Throughout the capitalist countries there are not less than 40,000,000 unem- ployed and the number co nstantly increases. In agriculture the crisis is no less ravaging and general. According to th e Department of Agri- culture bulletin of Dec. 16, 1931, the value of farm products declined from $8,765,820,000 in 1929 (which was already about 50% below 1919) to $4,122,850,000 in 1931, as against a decline of only 10% in prices of commod ities that farmers must buy. The terrific fall in the prices of agricultural products is graphically illus trated by th e fact that on Oct. 4, 1931 wheat reach ed 44 1/2 cents a bushel on the market, the lowest po int since the Civil War, with farmers getting as low as 25 cents. And world agriculture in the ca pitalist countries is in a similar crisis, prices recei ved by the peasants hav- ing fallen from 40% to 70% for the great staples, wheat, cotton, rice, rubber, silk, coffee, etc. In finance the world econom ic crisis also mani- fests itself with devast ating effects.

Stock exchange prices in many countries have dropped 50% to 75%, the general average in France de- clining from 437 in 1930 to 230 at the end of 1931. Huge deficits exist in a ll the national government budgets. Repudiation of in ternational debts is the order of the day, with the United States standing to lose, counting war debt s and other loans now in default, from 10 to 15 billion dollars. The United States, home of the world's strongest capitalism, presents a sim ilar picture of financial crisis. During 1931, 2,290 banks with deposits of $1,759,000,000 closed their doors, and 17,000 retail stores failed. In 1931, ba nk deposits declined by seven billion dolla rs. From the mi ddle of 1929 to the end of March, 1932, the average prices of 30 leading industrial stocks on the New York Stock Exchange dropped from $381.17 to $61.98. 2 The total loss in security \"values,\" according to B.

T HROUGHOUT capitalism the policy of the ruling class is to try to find a way out of the crisis by throwing its burden upon th e shoulders of the working class, the poor fa rmers and the lower sec- tions of the city petty bou rgeoisie. This is being done by a vast system of starving the unemployed, wage-cuts, speed-up, infl ation schemes, taxes di- rected against the masses , etc. In consequence, with the development of the crisis, there has been an enormous increase in th e impoverishment of the toiling masses. 3 Current History, November, 1931."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"8 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA Wholesale starvation, spre ading like a plague, is the order of the day in all capitalist countries. The bourgeoisie, intent only upon its own pleas- ures, cynically shrugs its shoulders at the whole terrible misery, when it does not hypocritically di- rect the masses towards religion for consolation. Nor are there \"scientists\" lacking to justify this mass starvation. Thus Pr of. E. G. Conklin of Princeton University says : \"Some of the weaker, according to the law of na ture, will naturally die under the stress of the times. Others will not propagate their kind. The strong and hardy will survive and reproduce, and thus the human race will be strengthened.\" 4 Since the onset of the present economic crisis American workers and poor farmers, through un- employment, part-time work, wage-cuts, reduced prices for agricultural prod ucts, tax increases, etc., have suffered a general decl ine in their living stand- ards of at least 50%. Prof. Leiserson estimates that the total income of industrial and office work- ers was about 22 billion do llars less in 1931 than in 1929, and this is supp orted by the figures of Business Week (Feb. 10). This is by no means offset by the decline in living costs which, accord- ing to the U. S. Dept . of Labor, amounted to 11.7% from June, 1929, un til June, 1931. On the farms, the Alexander Ham ilton Institute says, the average income per h ousehold has dropped from 4 New York Times, Jan. 28, 1932."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"THE DECLINE OF CAPITALISM 9 $887 in 1929 (already a cris is year in agriculture) to but $367 in 1931. By these gigantic reductions in their real income masses of toilers of field and factory have been forced down to actual starvation conditions. Even before the crisis the wo rking masses stood at the very threshold of destit ution. The average wage of industrial workers during the height of \"pros- perity\" did not exceed $2 3.00 per week. Conse- quently, the vast body of Am erican toilers existed from hand to mouth. They had very little re- serves. Paul Nystrom sa ys that 9,000,000 people in the United States li ved below the subsistence level. 5 Then came th e economic hurricane. The result is real destitutio n, verging in to actual starvation, on a broad s cale in the United States. \"Only in countries like India and China are there today larger numbers of workers suffering from mass unemployment, hunger, semi-starvation, dis- ease and other manifold evils of wholesale poverty than in the Unite d States — the richest country in the world,\" says the Statement of the National Hunger Marchers to C ongress, Dec. 7, 1931. \"One-third to one-half of our population is at vari- ous stages ranging from hunger to the pressing danger of losing homes and farms,\" says Governor LaFollette. The New York American, (Feb. 21, 1932), says: \"Food is lacking in 81 per cent of the New York City homes that have been stricken by 5 Economic Principles of Consumption."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"10 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA unemployment, the Emer gency Unemployment Relief Committee reported last night.\" William Hodson, executive director of the Welfare Council of New York City, informs us: \"Relief in New- York City is now on what might be called a disaster basis . . . the spectre of starvation faces millions who never were out of work before.\" The Balti- more Post, (Mar. 11, 1932), declares; \"40,000 face starvation in Baltimore.\" An Associated Press dispatch of Mar. 23, 1932, from Tulsa, Okla., says: \"Ten thousand persons have been living here since Nov. 1 on a charity ration costing six cents a day per person.\" So it is all over the count ry. The cities are full of \"Hoovervilles\" and brea dlines, where tens of thousands of homeless, hungry workers are com- pelled to exist in tin can shacks and to stand for hours to get a miserable bowl of soup. Workers fall famished in the street s in front of stores and warehouses that are crammed with the necessaries of life. Daily we read in the capitalist press of families actually starving to death. No longer is it \"news\" for a confused and desperate unemployed worker to blow out his brains or to do away with his family. The workers are losing wholesale the houses, radios, furniture, etc., that they so laboriously got together during the upward swing of American capitalism; thousands of farmers are losing their farms to the usurers. The Nation, (Mar. 23, "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"THE DECLINE OF CAPITA LISM 11 1932), says that in Detr oit alone 50, 000 workers lost their life savings in the collapsed banks, and similar huge losses have be en suffered all over the country. In 1931, according to the New York Journal, (Jan. 28), 198,738 workers' families were evicted from their homes in New York City for non-payment of rent. The worker's life has be- come an endless round of worry and misery. The j a i l s are filled to overflow ing, thousands preferring prison rigors to life unde r the Hoover regime of \"rugged individualism.\" Pr ostitution spreads like a poison weed in every American city. Tubercu- losis runs riot among the half-starved masses, and the hospitals are packed wi th sufferers of diseases bred of under-nourishment , etc., etc. To such a debacle has come the Hoov erian pre-election prom- ises of the \"abolition of poverty,\" \"a chicken in every pot\" and \"an autom obile in every garage\" for the workers. And da ily the whole maze of poverty, starvation, misery and death gets worse. Manifestly, a fundamentally necessary measure against actual starvation among the workers is the establishment of a system of federal unemploy- ment insurance, financed by the gov ernment and the employers. This must be of a permanent char- ncter, because what we have to deal with is not a temporary condition of une mployment, but a huge mass unemployment on a permanent basis. This, however, has not been don e. The capitalists and their government have forced the workers into "},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"12 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA wholesale starvation whic h is now infesting the country like a plague. The entire question of unemployment relief has been reduced to a charity basis. Although the worker has spent his life producing the wealth of the country, now when the capitalist system has broken down he is treat ed as a mendicant and a criminal. He is thrown a beggarly handout like a starving dog. Mr. Giffor d, head of Hoover's Emergency Employment Committee, boasted that in the 1931 Fall relief driv e about $150, 000,000 had been raised in the various localities. So far as the Federal government is conc erned, this money (what the workers get of it after the grafters are through) has to last the unemployed for the whole year. Thus it figures out at about $1.00 per month for each of the 12,000,000 unemployed. In New York, richest city in the world, after a disgusting campaign of begging, $18,000,000 of Gifford's fund was raised. This w ould give about $1.50 per month to each of New York's 1,000,000 unem- ployed. The unemployed relief program of the Hoover Government is a real hunger plan. It is the policy of the capitalist class an d it has the support of both big parties and the A. F. of L. That the Progressives also agree fu ndamentally with it is shown by the new unemploym ent insurance law in Wisconsin. This law adds insult to injury. Ac- cording to its beggarly provis ions unemployed "},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"THE DECLINE OF CAPITA LISM 13 workers can receive only a maximum of $100 yearly. And this applies only to those now em- ployed, for whom insuran ce funds will be gradu- a l l y built up. As for the masses of those totally unemployed now and part- time workers, they are left out of consideration altogether. If the capitalists have callously forced the toil- ing masses into starvati on conditions they have, however, very carefully looked after their own in- terests. \"During the firs t nine months of 1930, our national industrial a nd business system was able to and did pay $432,000,000 more in dividends and $191,000,000 more in in terest than it did in 1929; in the first nine months of 1931, the second year of the depression, it paid $347,000,000 more in dividends and $338 ,000,000 more in interest than it did in the first nine months of 1929.\" 6 The Publishers Financial Bur eau, (New York Ameri- can, Mar. 19, 1932), states that the industrial divi- dends paid in 1931 are \"t he largest for any year previous to 1929.\" Anna Rochester says: \"In September, 1931, the New York Times reported that of 5,000 companies, 50% had continued divi- dend payments without re duction; 20% were pay- ing smaller dividends; and only 30% had omitted payments entirely. . . . For October, 1931, the to- tal dividends plus bond in terest by a large group of corporations were only 4% below the high record 6 America Faces the Future, p. 370."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"14 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA of October, 1930.\" 7 Besides, every appeal of the bankers and other capitalis ts to the government for assistance has met with immediate response. The two billion dollar Reconstr uction Finance Corpora- tion has been organized and the Glass-Steagall inflation bill is being prep ared to absorb the worth- less paper of the banks and to underwrite the dividends of industrial co rporations. And in the new Federal taxes the ca pitalists are further shielded from the economi c effects of their own bankruptcy. In the other capitalist countries starvation con- ditions also grip the ma sses. In Germany, with wages down 30% since the hunger period of 1929 and millions getting no unemployment benefits, actual famine exists in many cities. The great masses in England are al most as badly-off. In Poland miners got 69 cen ts a day and have re- cently had another wage-cut. And the offensive to cut wages and reduce unemployment benefits and social insurance in ge neral goes on ever faster throughout Europe. In the colonial and semi- colonial countries crisis conditions also prevail. Famine stalks in China and India. In Brazil, says E. Penno, Brazilian Public Health Director, \"30,000,000 people are slowly dying of starvation, malaria and syphilis.\" Th e world over, the bank- rupt capitalist system is physically destroying the producing masses.

The capitalists cannot cure their deepeni ng crisis and have been unable to check its prog ress. The old tricks and slogans for making capitalism \"go\" are no longer potent. Pessimism and confusion begin to appear in the ranks of th e bourgeoisie. They start to see, not prosperity, but the re volution, \"just around the corner.\" Spengler asserts: \"It is no mere crisis, but the beginning of a catastrophe. 9 The chief economist of the Stock Exchange, Dr. Irving Fisher of Yale, in a sp eech cited by the United Press on Jan. 3, of this year, issued \"a warning to capitalism 'to clean the dirt of depression' from its foundation or be devour ed by some form of Socialism.\" In the recent debates in the House on the sales tax Rep. Rainey declared that the Ameri- can people \"are right up against Communism.\" Mr. Raymond Fosdick, (New York Times, Dec. 27, 1931), shrinks at the pr ospect of a revolution, stating that: \"Western ci vilization (read capital- ism, WZF) has begun to look furtively around, listening behind it for the si lent tread of some dread specter of destruction.\" W. F. Simms, Scripps- Howard Foreign Editor, in a dispatch of Oct. 5, 1931, says: \"The object of these epochal comings and goings (the various international conferen ces), it is admitted behind the scenes, is nothing more or less than to prevent, not merely the collapse of this or that particular country, 9 The American Mercury, January, 1932."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"THE DECLINE OF CAPITALISM 17 but of the white man's universe as a whole. For recent events have driven Washington, London, Paris, Berlin and Rome to the startling realization that only some sane accord on international fi nances, economics and arma- ments — and that promptly — can prevent a general smash.\" Such elements among the bourgeoisie become especially lugubriou s when they think of the Soviet Union. They begin to sense Communism as a higher and inevitable order of society. They more and more realize, as their own society goes deeper into crisis, that the U. S.S.R., forging ahead, is having a profoundly revolu tionary effect upon the masses of starving workers and poor peasants still under capitalism. Prof. Pollock, a bourgeois sci- entist, at the 1931 World C ongress for Social Plan- ning, said: \"The Soviet Union has filled millions of workers and peasants with hope and belief in a better future and of the possibility of further progress. With us, on the con- trary, things get worse every year. If capitalism is not capable of arousing equal en thusiasm and readiness for sacrifice in the masses, then there can be no doubt that they will finally choose the path of the Soviets.\" It is well known, of cour se, that the European bourgeoisie, animated by such fears, are taking many precautions for their personal safety. But it is \"news\" that American capitalists fe el the need for similar measures. In Liberty, Jan. 2, 1932, Cornelius Vanderbilt, Jr., says, speaking of the "},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"18 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA ultra-rich: \"They see the possibility of long vistas of hungry faces in breadlin es again this winter, and they fear the red specter of revolution. . . It is interesting to note th at since the beginning of the depression the yachts of society millionaires (in New York Harbor) have i nvariably been anchored in places where their ow ners could board them on short notice.\" These dark forebodings ar e true expressions of the fear eating at the consciousness of the capi- talist class. They serve to stimulate the offensive against the worker s. But, of course, the general policy of the capitalists does not limit itself to spreading such pessimism. On the contrary, espe- cially in the United States, they systematically cul- tivate optimism. As the ca pitalists intensify their drive against the workers' standards of living, they at the same time increase their propag anda about the impending return of prosperity. The burden of their song is that this is \"just another crisis,\" that the crises of the pa st have been overcome and have been followed by \"p rosperity,\" and that the same thing must happen again. The cultivation of such prosperity illusion s is one of the principal methods of the capitalists to break the resistance of the workers against wage -cuts, starvation, relief systems, etc. This pollyanna propaganda is best illustrated in the policy of the federal government. President Hoover started out, at th e time of the Wall Street "},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"THE DECLINE OF CAPITALISM 19 crash, by assuring everyone that this was only a financial bubble, that the great \"prosperity\" was safe. Then, when the indu strial crisis was upon us on all sides, he assured us, March 8, 1930, that \"the depression will be over in 60 days.\" And from that time on every department in the govern- ment has harped upon a similar string. Undoubt- edly, the effect of sowing such illusion s has been to facilitate the wholes ale cutting down of the workers' living standard s that has taken place. The theory that the crisis will cure itself and that all will be well again, is further classically illus- trated by Prof. Taussig, who advi ses us: \"Don't spend too much; don't hoard; don't worry; just live normally and everything will right itself in due time as it has always done.\" 10 The capitalist optimists are wrong; the fears of the pessimists are justified. What we have to deal with is not \"just another crisis,\" which will soon liquidate itself and be followed by a higher and worldwide wave of \"prosper ity.\" It is a profound economic crisis developing on the basis of a rapidly- deepening general crisis of capitalism. Arising out of fundamental weakne sses of the present so- cial system, it is setting on foot forces that are drastically undermining the very ec onomic, po- litical and social foundati ons of capi talism, and hastening that system ever faster towards the prole- tarian revolution. 10 Radio Broadcast, Jan. 23, 1932."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"20 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA Cyclical Crises I N ORDER to understand what is the matter with the capitalist system, why it is torn with economic crises, war and revolution and why it is sentenced to death as a social order, it is necessary to take at least a brief glance at the basic pr ocesses of capi- talism. If this is done it is readily seen that the capitalist system is a shak y house built upon sand. It is full of incurable in ternal contradictions which cause its conflicts and crises, which deepen with the development of capita lism, which produce its decline and decay, and whic h must culminate in its revolutionary overthrow. Over 80 years ago Marx pointed out these innate weaknesses of capitalism. The basic contradiction of capitalism, the source of all its weakness and of its final dissolution, is found in the fact that this system does not carry on production for the benef it of society as a whole but for the profit of a rela tively small owning class. The great industries by wh ich society must live are owned by private individuals who ruthlessly exploit the masses who work in these industries. Under capitalism producti on is regulated not by the needs of the masses but by whether or not the capitalist class can make a profit by such produc- tion; commodities are not produced primarily for use, but for profit.

This maze of con- flict turns around the two major contradictions into which the basic contradiction of capitalism re- solves itself. The first of these is economic, the tendency of capitalist pr oduction to exceed the buy- ing capacity of the masses a nd thus to cause crises of over-production. The se cond contradiction is social in character, the di vision of capit alist society into classes of exploiters and producers, with re- sultant class struggle between them. The first contradiction, making for the disruption of capi- talist economy and the impoverishment of the masses, provides the obje ctive conditions for even- tual revolution; the second, organizing the political struggle of the toiling masses, prepares the sub- jective factor, the revo lutionary working class. Now let us examine briefly the first of these major contradictions, the tendency of capitalist production to outstrip the markets, to cause over- production. Over-production is inherent in the capitalist system because the toiling masses, robbed in the industries by the em ployers, are paid back in the shape of wages only a fraction of the value they create. The wage of the worker remains essentially at the subsisten ce level, regardless of his productive capacity. "},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"22 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA This exploitation results in a piling up of com- modities in the hands of the capitalists, for natu- rally a worker getting a wage of three to five dollars a day cannot buy back the ten to twenty or more dollars' worth of commodities he has pro- duced. This gap between his producing and buy- ing powers widens by the c onstant increase in the workers' productive capaci ty through machinery and the speed-up and also by the lowering of their standards of living. The gigantic booty in the possession of the capitalists is further increased by their wholesale robbery of the poor farmers by pay- ing them low prices for their products, charging them monopoly prices fo r the commod ities they must buy, loading them down with exorbitant taxes, usurious loans, etc. The capitalists waste huge masses of these stolen commodities through luxuriou s living, by the crea- tion of hordes of parasitic occupations, by immense military establishments an d wars. They seek to dispose of them by expo rt trade. But the sur- pluses are not exhauste d by these means. There is an inevitable tendency to glut the market with unsaleable commodities. Ev en though, as now, the millions of producers, who make up the bulk of the population, may actua lly starve and die for want of the barest necessities of life, the market suffers from over-production. This basic tendency of capitalism to over-pro- duction (while the masses starve) results in actual "},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"THE DECLINE OF CAPITA LISM 23 economic crisis because of the competitive character of the capitalist system. Under capitalism there is and can be no general plan of production to fit social needs. Capitalist production is anarchic. The innumerable individua l capitalists and com- panies, ruthlessly explo iting the toiling masses, produce whatever they think they can sell by dint of sharp competition with each other. The results are, the impoverished masses not being able to buy back what they have produced, over-expansion of the industries, a genera l flooding of the markets and a hastening of the cap italist crisis of over- production. But the basic tendency of capitalism towards over-production does not re sult in immediate and chronic industrial stagnation, because it is partially offset by a counter tenden cy towards the expansion of the capitalist market . Among the principal factors historically in this market expansion have been the extension of cap italism upon a world scale, with a consequent wide development of transporta- tion and communication industries, the gradual conquest of the peasant a nd handicraft occupations and their re-organizatio n upon a capitalist basis, the large increase in population in all countries, the building of elementary pu blic services such as water and lighting plants in many countries, the huge growth of munitions making and the military establishment, etc. These developments of the capitalist market have"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"24 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA provided outlets for the investment of the capital robbed from the workers in the shape of surplus value. But the te ndency for the ma rket to expand has always lagged behind the tendency to clog the market with over-production. In consequence there is periodic need for the readjustment of these mutually antagonistic tendencies. These re- adjustments are the cyclical crises of capitalism. Marx made the first anal ysis of the causes and consequences of these cris es. Cyclical crises are common to all capitalists countries, including the United States, which has experienced 15 of such major economic disturbances since 1814. In the various countries the cycl es have averaged from seven to nine years. The development of the capi- talist system has not been even and steady, but by a series of jerks. The zi gzag graph made by the cyclical crises is the no rmal graph of capitalist growth the world over. The general course of the capitalist cycle is quite familiar. First, the upward trend, a period of in- dustrial expansion, with rising prices and wages, an era of good employme nt, \"prosperity\" and op- timism, gradually developi ng into a boom, with its characteristic orgies of fe verish produc tion, stock speculation, etc.; second ly, the downward trend, with the gradual surfeit of the market from excess production, slowing down of industry, wage-cuts, fall of prices, mass unem ployment, financial \"pan- ics\" and general economic crisis; and thirdly, the "},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"THE DECLINE OF CAPITALISM 25 trough of the crisis, in wh ich the productive forces are diminished and the choking surplus of com- modities, in the low state of production, are con- sumed or wasted in vari ous ways and the markets thus cleared for a fresh race between the swiftly expanding productive forces and the more slowly developing cap italist market. But the cyclical crisis is more than an economic disturbance. It also gr eatly sharpens the major social contradiction of cap italism, the ever-active antagonism between the working class and the capitalist class. In economic crises the capitalists always seek to shift th e economic burden onto the workers through wage-cuts, etc., and this still further stokes the class st ruggle. Hence, the capi- talist cyclical crises have been especially periods of great strikes fiercely fought, growing class con- sciousness of the workers, etc. The present economic crisis bears this cyclical character, but it develops under the special condi- tions of the deepening gene ral crisis of capitalism, which profoundly change its character and deepen its effects in every direction. The General Crisis of Capitalism T HE TREND of capitalist development is not, how- ever, a simple repetition of cycles, with capitalism necessarily having a broa dened base and stronger sinews after each cyclical cr isis. It is a bourgeois "},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"26 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA fallacy that production and exchange, in the long run, automatically balan ce each other under capi- talism, that the capitalist market mechan ically ex- pands to accommodate the increased production. On the contrary, as we have seen, the capitalist system, in its very esse nce, leads to over-pro- duction. This tende ncy to over-production is vastly strengthened as capitali sm develops. The pro- ductive powers of the wo rkers more and more outrun their consumptive capacity. Thus the ma- jor economic contradiction of capitalism, that be- tween production and exch ange, becomes ever deeper and more devastating, and with it, like its shadow, grows an intensification of the revolu- tionary class struggle. Capitalism can live only by a rapid extension of its market, so that the ev er-increasing masses of surplus value r obbed from the wo rkers may be disposed of through ne w capital investment. Therefore, the widening of the gap between the productive forces and the consuming power of the impoverished masses progressively brings the whole capitalist system into br oader and deeper crises, into sharper class struggl e, and eventually into decay and decline. Karl Marx clearly foresaw the development of this gene ral crisis of capitalism when, speaking of the manner of liquidating the cyclical crises, he said it was \"paving the way for more extensive and more destructive crises and diminishing the means wh ereby crises are pre- "},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"THE DECLINE OF CAPITALISM 27 vented.\" As Varga says; \"Each cycle is at the same time a step in the hi story of capitalism, bring- ing it nearer to its termination.\" 11 So far, in fact, has this general trend gone that the world capi- talist system can be said definitely to have entered its period of decay. That is, capitalism no longer has to deal simply with cyc lical crises, each of which left it upon a higher plane, but a growing general crisis, political as well as economic, which marks its decline as a world system. The history of capitalist development may be divided into two general er as, industrial capitalism and imperialism. The former was the period of \"healthy\" capitalism, of its rapid rise and exten- sion; the latter is the peri od of its decay and de- cline. As Lenin says, \"I mperialism is the final stage of capitalism.\" Re garding the early phase of capitalism, the Program of the Communist In- ternational states: \"The period of industrial capitalism was, in the main, a period of 'free competition,' a period of a steady develop- ment and expansion of capitalism throughout the entire world, when the as yet unoccupied colonies were being divided up and conquered by armed force; a period of continued growth of the inherent contradictions of capi- talism, the burden of which fell mainly upon the sys- tematically plundered, crushed and oppressed colonial periphery.\" Imperialism is the era of monopolistic capitalism. It has been analysed by Lenin in his Imperialism, 11 International Press Co rrespondence, No. 27, 1931."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"28 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA which may be summarized as follows: (a), the con- centration of industry and the development of trusts and other monopoly fo rms; (b), the concen- tration of banking capital and its amalgamation with industrial capital un der the hegemony of fi- nance capital; (c), the e xport of capital from the imperialist countries; (d), the division of the world among monopolistic unions of capitalists, cartels, syndicates and trusts; (e), the territorial division of the world among the great imperial powers. The correctness of this el ementary analysis is clear. It would serve no purpose to summon sta- tistics to show th e gigantic growth of trusts and powerful banks in all capit alist countries, and the supremacy of finance capital. The significance of the export of capital is th at when it takes place it means that the faster de veloping productive forces have quite outrun the slow er developing home mar- ket in the given country a nd that it becomes neces- sary to find foreign ma rkets for the excess of capital and other commoditie s. All the great capi- talist countries have reach ed this stage, England being the earliest and most classi cal example. The growth of the internationa l trusts and cartels and \"spheres of influence\" are a matter of common knowledge. And as for Le nin's final proposition, the division of the worl d among the capitalist pow- ers with the growth of imperialism, he says: \"In 1876 three powers had no colonies; and a fourth one, France, had hardly any. In 1914 those four pow- "},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"THE DECLINE OF CAPITA LISM 29 ers had acquired a coloni al empire of 14,100,000 square kilometers, or approximately one and a half times greater than the area of Europe, with a popu- lation of some 100,000,000 souls . . . the division of the world was 'completed' by the dawn of the 20th century.\" 12 The United States began cl early to show its im- perialistic character about 1900. This was evi- denced by the intensific ation of the growth of trusts, the rapid rise to dominance of the great bunking interests, and by the beginnings of a sys- tem of colonies through th e seizure of the Philip- pines, Cuba, Porto Rico, etc., and the development of \"spheres of influence\" in China, Latin America, etc. All these tendencies increased with the pas- sage of the years, but it was only after the World War that American imperi alism came to maturity. Fattening upon the slain of that great slaughter, with the other imperialis t countries pa ralysed by the murderous struggle, Am erican imperialism was able to export capital (i ncluding the war loans) to the gigantic amount of 27 billion dollars. It has widely penetrated into a score of Latin American countries, reducing them to semi-colonies. Its in- fluence in Canada is treme ndous. It tries, with its Young Plan and ot her financial sche mes of enslave- ment, to reduce Europe to its control. It has a hand in every imperialisti c robbery in China and Africa. With its great navy and pote ntially tre- 12 Imperialism, p. 66."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"30 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA mendous military es tablishment, it has become the most powerful and ruthless of imperialist powers, aiming at hegemony over the world. The development of world imperialism enor- mously sharpened all the c ontradictions of capital- ism. The major economic contradiction between the producing and consumi ng powers of the masses was vastly deepened. Th e productive powers were increased, the exploitation of the workers in the in- dustrial countries and the colonial masses was in- tensified. The class str uggle became more acute, the war danger more menacing. The great pow- ers began to fight more re lentlessly to conquer the lagging world markets to di spose of their choking surpluses of commodities, to wi n new sources of supplies of raw materials for their industries and to re-divide the world to their respective advan- tage. Capitalism began defi nitely to show signs of the developing general crisis. The World War was a great clash of the sharp- ening imperialist antagonism s, an acute expression of the growing general cris is of the capitalist econ- omy. It was an attempt of the various powers to solve their deepening proble ms by eliminating each other as competitors in th e world market and by re- dividing the colonial world. The capitalist na- tions, developing with un even tempo, could not tolerate the pre-existing division of markets and colonies. The great capitali st crisis which was the World War naturally cau sed a tremendous inten- "},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"THE DECLINE OF CAPITA LISM 31 sification of the class struggle. Revolutionary upheavals took place in many countries. The out- standing result was the loss to capitalism of one- sixth of the globe, Russia, and what prevented its losing Germany, Italy and several other countries were the counter-revolutiona ry activities of the So- cialist parties against th e revolutionary workers, which defeated the revolut ion in these countries. After the great war and these revolutionary up- heavals, which nearly kill ed it, capitalism got a brief breathing spell. By 1924 it had achieved what the Communist Intern ational called a \"par- tial and temporary stabili zation,\" both economi- cally, and politically. Econom ically this was based upon the replacement of th e material destruction wrought by the war, catc hing up with the war- caused building shortage, and by investment of capital necessary to ratio nalize antiquated indus- tries in various countries ; and politically it was based on the defeat of th e revolutionary attempts of the proletariat. But this breathing spell for capitalism did not last long. The tendency for capitalist production to outrun the markets s oon manifested itself stronger than ever. In a number of capitalist countries there has been an intense rationalization of industry. Thus in th e United States, which is the extreme illustration, from 1923 to 1928 there was a total of 200,000 less workers required to pro- "},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"32 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA duce 42% more in the industries. 13 On the rail- roads a given quantity of fr eight is transported now by 33% fewer workers than 20 years ago. 14 Tug- well shows increases in e fficiency in the various industries, 1914 to 1925, of from 10% (meat pack- ing) to 210% (automobiles). 15 And in agricul- ture, 14% less farm workers produced 20% more crops in 1925 than in 1910. 16 Besides, in the colonial and semi-colonial countries, such as India, China, Africa, Australia, etc., there has been con- siderable industrialization in spite of the deter- mined efforts of the imperi alist countries to prevent it and to retain these coun tries simply as markets for their manufactured ar ticles and as sources of raw materials. The purchasing power of the masses has in no sense kept pace with th is increased producing capacity. On the co ntrary, there has been a vast crippling of the capitalis t market through whole- sale reductions in the re al wages of workers and the incomes of farmers the world over; that is, by the widespread impoverishme nt and decline in the living standards of the ma sses. The result is a great clogging of the world markets and the present unprecedented economic crisis. 13 A.

In the United States this has been marked by the whol esale wiping out of small business, the mergers of banks, the liquidation of stock-holdings of the petty bourgeoisie, the con- fiscation of great areas of farm land by foreclosure, etc. This rapid concentrat ion of capital intensifies all the contradictio ns of capitalism. It has produced, togeth er with the unparalleled depth and breadth of the ec onomic crisis and mass starvation, previously di scussed, many other mani- festations which, in sum, constitute the general crisis an d decay of capitalism in this, its final stage of monopoly and imperialism.

They intensify the contradiction between the capitalist methods of production and exchange; they broaden and deepen the struggles between workers and capitalists, be- tween t h e various capitalist countries, between the imperialist countries and the colonies, and between the two world systems represented by capitalism as a whole and the U.S.S.R. They are undermining "},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"34 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA the foundations and breaking down the very fiber of capitalism. They make more and more for in- dustrial paralysis, mass st arvation, war, revolution. Some of the more outstan ding of these manifes- tations of the growing gene ral crisis are, without analyzing in detail the specific gravity of each: (a) Over-expansion of In dustry: In view of the limited capacities of the capitalist markets, there is a large over-expan sion of the industrial plant in all the leading ca pitalist countries. This constantly grows more pronounced. The United States is a striking example of this condition. It is typically illustrated by the automobile industry with a capacity estimate d at 10,000,000 cars yearly and a record output of but 4,500,000; the bitumi- nous coal mines with a cap acity of 750,000,000 tons yearly and an output ( 1929) of 535, 000,000; the steel industry with a capaci ty of 65,000 ,000 tons and a maximum output (1929) of 56,000,000; tex- tiles with 50% excess plan t capacity, etc. Even in the greatest boom periods these capacities can- not be fully utilized. Su ch conditions, common to the most highly industrialized countries of capi- talism, are not only basi c causes of the economic crisis but also prolific br eeders of the ultra-reac- tionary practices of the de struction of commodities and such dismantling of i ndustry as the present proposal to tear out 100,000 British looms and 10,000,000 spindles. "},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"THE DECLINE OF CAPITA LISM 35 (b) Chronic Industrial Stagnation: In the growing general crisis of capitalism there is an intensification of the wh ole phenomenon of the eco- nomic crisis. As Varg a says: \"Crises now follow more speedily upon one another, attain a greater depth, and shake bourgeois rule more violently than before.\" Besides this, whol e sections of the capi- talist economy, even before the present crisis, had fallen into a state of more or less chronic depression. Thus England and Germany, the one with its for- eign trade ruined and the other hamstrung by its imperialist rivals, had been in practically perma- nent crisis since the end of the war. Besides, the older industries (coal, te xtiles, shipbuilding, etc.) had suffered a similar stagnation in all industrial countries including the United States; only the newer industries (automobile s, chemicals, electri- cal, etc.) experiencing substantial growth and ex- pansion. As for agricu lture, it had been in a p r o longed world-wide cris is of unprecedented di- mensions, due primarily to a vast over-production of wheat, cotton, rubber, co ffee, sugar, etc., caused by the lowered buying power of the world's toilers, improved methods of prod uction, increased acre- age, etc. The present economic crisis , despite eventual re- covery here and there, wi ll unquestionably intensify and spread this condition of chronic industrial stag- nation. At the same time that the purchasing capacity of the produci ng masses drops, the ra- "},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"36 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA tionalization of industry is procee ding apace, at least on the stronger sectors of capitalism. A. T. Sloan says, for example: \"As a result of the re- adjustment and refinement that is going on, our industrial machine is more efficient, more effective from every standpoint than ev er before in its his- tory.\" 17 That is it exactly; mo re able than ever to flood the sickly market with a fresh mass of un- saleable commodities. We can be sure that the present economic crisis w ill involve the older indus- tries and weaker sections of capitalist economy into still deeper and more permanent stagnation. (c) Permanent Mass Unemployment: Through- out the leading capitalist co untries, as one of the most basic features of th e growing crisis of capi- talism, is an ever-increas ing army of unemployed. Capitalism, unable to prov ide work for the work- ers, faces permanent mass unemployment on a gigantic scale. This te ndency was typically illus- trated by the la rge army of jobless in England ever since the end of the World War, and by the fact that in the United States, even during the boom period of 1929, there were at least 3,000,000 unemployed. In Germany and England it has reached the point where many youths graduate from school and reach ma nhood without ever hav- ing had a job, and with little prospect of getting one. In the present economi c crisis this perma- nently jobless mass of wo rkers, full of fatal por- 17 New York Times, Jan. 7, 1932."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"THE DECLINE OF CAPITA LISM 37 tent to capitalism, is being added to by many mil- lions. 18 (d) The Choking of Inte rnational Trade: One of the sure signs of the decline of capitalism is the systematic strangling of in ternational trade that is now taking place. This is being done principally by high tariffs and under slogans of \"economic na- tionalism\" and \"aut archy.\" In their bitter fight for markets, the capitalist countries generally have adopted the double-phased policy of high tariffs and dumping. Tariffs everywhere are at un- precedented heights and constantly going higher. \"Free trade\" England has now become a leader in this reactionary movement. The general result is to greatly intensify the i ndustrial paralysis and trade stagnation. The tendency is for each capi- talist country to wall its elf off from the commerce of the others. Mussolini says: \"This blockading of the free flow of trade has caught hold of the world and the grip is pl aced like that of a power- ful wrestler on his adversary. It cannot move its component parts and though it writhes and rebels it is helpless.\" 19 Then, to show what a construc- tive program Fascism has, he jacks up the Italian tariff a few notches and launches a \"Buy Italian\" campaign to match th e \"Buy British,\" \"Buy 18 Marx (Capital, Vol. I, p. 308) indicated the revolutionary significance of the rapidly growing army of unemployed when he said: \"A development of the productive forces which would diminish the actual number of laborers . . . would cause a revolution, be- cause it would put the majority of the population on the shelf.\" 19 New York American, Dec. 27, 1931."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"38 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA French,\" etc. movements. This \"economic na- tionalism\" cannot lessen, but must intensify the general crisis of capitalism. (e) The Breakdown of the Medium of Ex- change: An important sign of the general weaken- ing of capitalism is the breakdown of the medium of exchange in the indivi dual countries and inter- nationally. More than half of the capitalist world is now off the gold standard, and the percentage constantly grows; in ev ery capitalist country, in- cluding the United States (Finance Reconstruction Corporation, etc.), various systems of inflating the currency are in effect. No t only are the individual capitalist countries of them selves unable to main- tain a stable currency, but, in their brutal struggles with each other, they ar e breaking down the capi- talist exchange medium ge nerally. They fight to bankrupt each other. The raid on the mark early in 1931 smashed the German and Austrian finan- cial system, compelled the United States to grant the moratorium, forced Germany and Austria to their knees before French imperialism and almost provoked a gigantic economic collapse in Central Europe. The raid on th e pound following soon after drove Great Britain off the gold standard, wrecked the Labor governme nt and deposed Lon- don as the world's money center. Then came the raid on the dollar, which co st the United States the loss of $500,000,000 in 20 days and which menaces the gold standard in this co untry. All this was "},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"THE DECLINE OF CAPITALISM 39 tied up with the internecine struggle over the ques- tion of the international war debts and reparations. (f) The Development of Fascism: Another of the pronounced symptoms of the decline of capi- talis m is the growth of Fascism in various forms in all capitalist countries. The capitalists, faced with the task of drastic ally slashing the living standards of the workers and poor peasants and, where the political crisis is acute, the job of trying to save the capitalist syst em itself, no longer find adequate their bourgeois \"d emocracy,\" of which the Social Democracy is a pa rt, to hold the rebellious masses in check. Consequen tly, with the aid of the Social Democrats, or Social Fascists, 20 they are t r a n s forming the masked \"democratic\" capitalist dictatorship into open Fasc ist dictatorship, with its extreme demagogy and use of violence against the workers and poor peasants. Mussolin i is not the symbol of a new era of capitalist development, but the sign of a decadent system of society vainly try- ing to hold back the clock of social progress. (g) The Birth of a New World Social System: The most significant of a ll signs of the decline of capitalism is the rise of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics. Cap italism no longer stands dominant in the world with its only rival the de- clining remnants of feudalis m. Today it faces a new and deadly rival, th e forerunner of the new 20 Communists use the terms \"Social Democrat,\" \"Social Fascist\" and \"Social Reformist\" practically interchangeably; why, we shall see in Chapter IV. "},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"40 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA world social order. The ri se of the Soviet Union enormously weakens the wo rld capitalist system. Capitalism has thereby lost territorially one-sixth of the globe, and it is rapidly losing more to the Chinese Soviets; it has lo st control of the great markets and raw materials of what was old Russia; it suffers enormously in loss of prestige in the com- parison of its industrial crisis and generally de- cadent conditions with th e great advance of the U.S.S.R.; it confronts th e deadly menace of its workers inspired and organized by this great ex- ample of the success of Socialism. And all these losses and dangers for capital ism in the rise of the U.S.S.R. will increas e as time goes on. To the foregoing signs of the growing capitalist crisis and decline many mo re could be added, in- cluding the increase of the socially parasitic classes of mere bond clippers, the gr owth of artificial stimu- lants for the market such as instalment buying, the reversion to pre-capitalis t forms of production and barter, the smothering of inventions and improved methods of production, et c. But most significant are the menacing danger of war and the world-wide revolutionary upsurge of the toiling masses. The War Danger W AR IS inevitable under the capitalist system. Imperialism is the era of great world wars. The capitalist imperialists cons ciously use war as a "},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"THE DECLINE OF CAPITA LISM 41 weapon for furthering their interests just as they do tariffs and dumping. They cold-bloodedly send millions to slaughter in order to eliminate their imperialist competitors and to reduce whole popu- lations to their programs of exploitation. The general crisis of capitalism, with its vastly sharpen- ing antagonisms, is fast driving capitalism to a new world war; in fact, war is already here, in Manchuria and China prope r. Only 14 years after the great \"war to end all war\" we stand on the brink of a still more frightful shambles. How deliberately capitali sts consider war as a necessary part of their business was shown by the New York correspondent of the London Daily Telegraph who, on Dec. 23, 1916, wrote: \"The rumors of peace which were current during the last week caused alarm on the New York Exchange and a sharp drop in the value of bonds. The price of wheat dropped heav ily. Everybody is talking about the disasters which will occur upon the con- clusion of peace.\" Now the capitalists of the world are just as cynically looki ng to war as the broad way out of the present cr isis. They see in mass murder on the battlefields the way to make busi- ness good with bonanza pr ofits for themselves. They are circulating pr opaganda am ong the un- employed workers that war is the only way to re- start the crippled indust ries, to do away with unemployment. They prep are war to beat back the advancing world revolu tion, to overthrow the "},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"42 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA Soviet Union. The cyni cal militarist, General William Mitchell, says: \"M any nations think that at this time a foreign wa r would do them a great deal more good than domestic insurrection and revolution.\" 21 But capitalism, characteri stically, hides its war plans behind a mask of paci fism. This is to throw dust in the eyes of the masses who would rebel against a frank statement of imperialist war aims. As the war nears the cap italists multiply their camouflage peace conferences , disarmament meets, etc., behind which the pr eparations for war pro- ceed ever faster. For mode rn warfare pacifism is just as necessary as airpla nes. It is characteristic of capitalist pacifist hypoc risy that the principal architect of the militaris tic French imperialism, Briand, is hailed as the great apostle of interna- tional peace. The League of Nations is not a peace-striving institution, as the capitalis ts and their Social Fas- cist flunkeys would have us believe; it is a grouping of imperialist bandits intent only upon their own schemes of mass explo itation and war making. The Kellogg Pact, instead of being, as Nicholas M. Butler says, \"the supreme act of the age in which we live,\" is a monstrous lu re to blind the masses to the slaughter that is be ing prepared. In Man- churia, Japan, a member of the League and a signer of the Pact, wiped its feet on this \"scrap of 21 Liberty, Jan. 30, 1932."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"THE DECLINE OF CAPITALISM 43 paper\" and exposed the League of Nations' im- perialist character. And what could be more bankrupt than the present \"disarmament\" confer- ence of the League now being held in Geneva. The Social Fascists and bourgeois pacifists who support the various \"peace\" plans of the capitalist governments (while at the same time they vote the war budgets) are only catspaws; they play the game of imperialism by creating illusions among the masses that the war like capitalist governments actually want peace. Only by the mass resistance of the workers can the war plans of the capitalists be delayed; only when the toiling masses have de- feated the world bourgeoisi e can war be abolished altogether. Behind the smoke-screen of pacifism war arma- ments pile up. Now they are greater than ever before in \"peace\" times. Over 10,000,000 men are now under arms and 35,00 0,000 are in reserve.

Among the great capita list powers there exist many antagonisms, any of which may produce a devastating war, and these antagonisms constantly become more acute under th e pressure of the deep- ening crisis of capitalism. Of them the more important are: the struggle between the United States and Great Britain for world imperialist hegemony; 25 the conflict between the United States and the rising system of French imperialism; the four-cornered fight between the United States, Japan, Great Britain and France for domination of the Far East; the struggle between Great Britain and France for financial supremacy and general leadership in Eu rope; the struggle of France and her vassal States (Poland, Rumania, Czecho-Slovakia, etc.) to choke Germany into submission and to hang on to their Versailles Treaty blood booty; the sh arp antagonisms between France and Italy over co ntrol of the Mediter- ranean area; the tangle of potential war conflicts in the Balkans; and, of pres ent special acuteness, the struggle between the Unite d States and Japan for imperialist control in th e Far East.

The antagonisms between the imperialist coun- tries and the colonial a nd semi-colonial countries likewise grow constantly more sharp. Stalin says: \"The European bourge oisie is in a state of war with 'its' colonies in India, Indo-China, Indo- nesia and Northern Africa.\" 26 One of the basic indications of the growin g decline of world capi- talism is the weakening of the hegemony of the imperialist powers over th e colonial countries, the necessity of the imperialis ts to use more and more armed force against the colonies. These growing conflicts are caused primar ily by the at tempts of the imperialist countries to shift the bu rden of the crisis onto the colonial countries by means of in- tensified exploitation of th e peasants and workers, tariffs, high taxes, the crippling of local industry, etc., all backed by imperialist troops, and by the rebellion of the colonial masses against this im- poverishment.

But the greatest and most imminent of war dangers is that between world imperialism and the Soviet Union. This antag onism is the most fun- damental of all economic, political and social con- flicts.

The im perialist powers, faced by dauntless revolutionary soldiers, fearing revolu- tion at home and learning to their dismay that their armies of workers and peasants often mu- tinied rather than fight against the Russians (this being the case also with the 310th United States Infantry at Archangel), had to abandon for the time being their pr ogram of violent overthrow of the Soviets. But the capitalist power s did not give up their counter-revolutionary determination.

But this was defeated by the prompt and victorious action of the Red Army.

Now, in the Manchurian invasion by Japan, world imperialism is developing a new and still more dangerous attack against the Soviet Union. In its present imperialist war against the Chinese, Japan has clearly in mind the following objectives: (1), the dismemberment of China and the capture of its markets; ( 2 ) , th e crushing of the rapidly spreading Chinese Soviets; (3 ), the establishment of a strong base in Manchuria from which to launch an early attack upon the Soviet Union.

It seems that the inevitability of crossing swords with Russia on the fields of Mongolia in order to ga in possession of the wealth of North Manchuria is part of our program of national de- velopment.'* While the general strategy of world imperialism is to develop the attack against the Soviet Union, this does not go forward on th e basis of a solid bloc or united front of all its leaders with Japan, spear- head of imperialism, in China. This is because the violent antagonisms between the imperialist powers prevent such a fi rm unity. France, which actively prepares the offensive against the U.S.S.R. through Poland, etc., is solidly united with Japan and supports it. But England man- euvers against France a nd Japan and has its eye on its Chinese interests, es pecially in the Shanghai district. As for the United States, it views with alarm the strengthening of its traditional enemy in the Pacific, Japan. But all these powers are violent enemies of the Soviet Union, and thei r mutual antagonisms do not prevent the developmen t of the imperialist at- tack generally against the U.S.S.R. In the In- "},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"52 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA ternational Press Corres pondence, Mar. 10, 1932, a writer puts the situation thus: \"The sharpness of the imperialist antagonisms renders difficult the formation of new groupings of power. But — as the Japanese campaign in Manchuria and in the Yangtse valley shows—it not only does not form an in- surmountable obstacle to the immediate war preparations but is also no obstacle preventing the world from creep- ing into the world war, into military intervention against the Soviet Union. As expe rience shows, these groupings are formed at the outbreak and partly even in the course of war, in the carrying out of military operations.\" The danger of imperialist war against the U.S.S.R. is now most acu te. The imperialist ban- dits are trying to force the Soviet Union into the Manchurian war. That is the purpose of Japan's studied insolence and pr ovocation, its massing of troops on the Soviet border, its organization of the counter-revolutionary Wh ite Russians. And the significance of the attemp ted assassination of the Japanese ambassador in Moscow by Vanek, a Czecho-Slovakian diplomat, was that France tried to organize another Sarajevo. Only the steadfast peace policy of the Soviet Union has prevented its being enmeshed in war. But there is a limit to such provocation.

The World-Wide Revo lutionary Upsurge. T HE MOST basic indication of the growing general crisis of capitalism and its decline as the social or- der is the increasing revolutionary upsurge throughout the world. The toiling millions, find- ing it impossible to live in the star vation condi- tions everywhere developi ng, are gradua lly getting ready to wipe out capitalism and to establish So- cialism. In his profound analysis of capitalist society, Marx says: \"Along with the constantly diminishing number of the magnates of capital . . . gr ows the mass of misery, op- pression, slavery, degradation, exploitation, but with this grows the revolt of the working class, a class always in- creasing in numbers, and disciplined, united, organized by the very mechanism of cap italist production itself.\" 27 27 Capital, Vol. I, p. 836."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"54 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA Reformist Socialists have always violently at- tacked this conception of growing working class pauperization and revolt. They have put in its stead their own theory of the gradual rise in the standards of the workers and their progressive acceptance of capitalist evol ution as the way to So- cialism. For a period, during the rise of impe- rialism in the leading indus trial countries, bringing about improved conditions for the labor aristoc- racy, largely at the expe nse of the exploited co- lonial masses, the worki ngs of Marx's principle were somewhat obscured. The opportunist Social- ists were able to lend an air of plausibility to their bourgeois theories about the advancing standards of the working class under capitalism. But now, with the development of the general crisis of capitalism, the truth of Marx's formula- tion stands out with crysta l clearness. Truly, as the Communist Manifesto says, \"pauperism de- velops more rapidly than population and wealth,\" and \"it becomes evid ent that the bourg eoisie is unfit any longer to be the ruling class in society . . . because it is incompetent to assure an existence to its slave in his slavery, because it cannot help let- ting him sink into such a state that it has to feed him, instead of being fed by him.\" That is, on the one hand, as we have alr eady seen, there is mass impoverishment developing upon the most gigantic scale, and on the other, as we shall now indicate, "},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"THE DECLINE OF CAPITA LISM 55 there is the growing revolt of the workers, so clearly foreseen by Marx. The revolutionary upsurg e of the workers and peasants is worldwide. It varies in intensity, corresponding to the uneven development of capi- talism in the several count ries, from intensified strike movements to act ual struggles for power. Its tempo is greatly incr eased by the deepening of the capitalist crisis. Ho over had a smell of its significance when, in his message to Congress on Dec. 8, 1931, he inform s us that: \"Within two years there have been revol utions or acute social disorders in 19 countries, em bracing more than half the population of the world.\" The resolution of the XI Plenum of the Ex ecutive Committee of the Communist International, (April, 1931), thus analyses the situation: \"There has been a further increase in the revolutionary upsurge bound up with the sharp reduction in the stand- ard of living of the working class, the monstrous develop- ment of unemployment, the ru ination of the office workers and urban petty bourgeoisie, the mass robbery of the peasantry, the extreme impoverishment of the colonies and the growing revolutionizing role of the U.S.S.R. \"The growing revolutionary upsurge found expression in: (a) the further intensification of the strike struggle and the unemployment movement, (b), the development and strengthening of Soviets and of the Red Army over a considerable area in China, ( c) , the growth of the revo- lutionary movement in the colonies, (d), the development of the revolutionary peasant movement, (e), the growth "},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"56 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA of the political and organizational influence of a number of important Communist Parties (Germany, China, Czecho-Slovakia, Poland), (f), the sharp intensification of oppositional ferments within the Social Democracy, (g), the growth of an opposition among the petty bour- geois masses of the towns, office employees and civil servants.\" In the months since the foregoing was written the revolutionary upsurge has been accelerated on every front. In the indus trial countries of Eu- rope the strike movement has been greatly broad- ened and intensified, in sp ite of the efforts of the powerfully intrenched Socialists to stifle all strug- gle. The strikes are more numerous, they include more workers and they ar e more militantly carried on. During this period one of the most striking events was the mutiny of the British Navy sailors against a wage-cut. This affair sent a shiver along the spine of the world bourgeoisie. The United States is not exempt from the de- veloping world-wide m ovement of struggle. American workers, faced by intolerable conditions, are also exhibiting the characteristic signs of radi- calization. During 1931 th e number of strikers doubled over the previous year. A series of im- portant strikes have been carried on (coal miners in Western Pennsylvania , Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky and the anthracite districts, textile work- ers in Lawrence, Allentow n, Paterson, etc.) in spite of the rankest betray al by the A.

The unemploye d are also showing increased radicalization, indicated by such im- portant movements as th e National Hunger March, the Ford Hunger March, the big demonstrations in Chicago, Cleveland, etc.; notwithstanding the extreme brutality of the po lice, nine workers hav- ing been killed in the thr ee latter movements. The Negro workers, in strikes and unemployment movements, have been distinguished for their mili- tancy, the Camp Hill and Scottsboro outrages be- ing attempts of local au thorities to terrify them. Among the skilled workers a striking demonstra- tion of the radicalizatio n taking place is the rank and file referendum of une mployment in surance in the A. F. of L., a move ment involving hundreds of thousands of workers and going directly contrary to the policy of the reactionary leadership. These are only a few indications of the deep-going radi- calization now taking place among the American working class. But, of th is subject, more will be said in Chapter IV. In Germany events are moving towards a revo- lutionary political crisis. The masses of workers, in spite of Socialist tr eachery and Fascist repres- sion, are preparing to fr ee themselves from the tyranny of the Versaille s Treaty and its Young Plan, and with it, from th e capitalist system itself. The Communist party, rapidly growing, now counts almost five million votes. The proletarian "},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"58 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA revolution advances irresi stibly in Germany. It is in the vain hope of de feating it that the employ- ers are building up Fasc ism through the Social Fascists, the Bruening gove rnment and the Hitler movement. Poland is another country where the revolution begins to menace capitalism. The industrial and agrarian crises are acute . More than half the workers are either wholly or partly unemployed. One wave of wage-cuts follows another. The peasants are expropriated in masses for non-pay- ment of rent. The country is burdened with militarism. The various national minorities are ruthlessly repressed. Th e country is stagnant from the loss of its former Russian markets. In this situation the Communist party, in spite of the ferocious terror of Pilsudski and Social Fascist treachery, steadily ga ins ground. Th e workers and peasants are becoming rapidly revolutionized. Great strikes, unemployment demonstrations and anti-tax and rent movement s in the villages develop in rapid succession. Th ere is a revolutionary storm brewing. Spain is also a country where capitalism faces a developing revolutionary crisis. The producing masses suffer intolerabl e exploitation and misery from capitalist and semi -feudal conditions. The first phase of their revolt swept away the mon- archy; now it turns sharply against capitalism it- self. Social Fascist, Anarchist and Syndicalist "},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"THE DECLINE OF CAPITALISM 59 illusions still act as a brak e on the movement, but the revolutionary Communist party constantly be- comes stronger. The recent seizure of many towns and villages and the hoistin g of the red flag are forerunners of the revolu tionary struggle that is on its way. Throughout the whole As ian colonial and semi- colonial world the revolu tionary upsurge manifests itself upon a gigantic scal e. The basic trend of the hundreds of millions of toilers in th ese countries is towards Socialism, not capitalism. The efforts of the national bourgeoi sie, led by the Gandhis, Chang Kai Sheks, etc., to build up a powerful capitalism shatter themselv es upon the rocks of the world industrial and agrari an crisis, the determina- tion of the imperialists (to whom the native bour- geoisie always surrenders) to prevent the in- dustrialization of the co lonies, and the revolu- tionary struggles of the va st masses of incredibly exploited and impoverished workers and peasants. Under the increasing leader ship of the Communist International, these revo lutionary national strug- gles develop more and more, not only into fights again American, British, Japanese, French and Dutch imperialist dominati on, but against the whole capitalist system. Asia is now undergoing pro- found revolutionary developments. In China, 70,000,000 people are already living under the Provisional Chinese Soviet government, organized Nov. 7, 1931. The Chinese Red Army "},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"60 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA controls one-sixth of China and is constantly- spreading its influence. It is now hammering at the gates of Hankow. Strikes and peasant move- ments develop in many other parts of China. The prestige of the Kuomintang diminishes; that of the Communist party rises. \"Everywhere a decided swing to the left is evident\" said a New York Times Chinese correspondent on Jan. 20, 1931. And 11 days later another said in the same paper: \"Again the Communists are making rapid progress in or- ganizing town and country Soviets as rapidly as they overrun new territory . . . the peasants and common people are giving a hearty welcome to the returning Communists. They say that after com- paring their status under previous Communist rule with the bad government a nd confiscatory taxation enforced upon them after the arrival of the Nan- king troops last Summer, they enjoyed greater lib- erty and a greater degree of prosperity under the Reds than under Nanking.\" It was largely the fear of the growing Chinese revolution, its tre- mendous effect upon the vast millions of Asia, the danger of a great Russian-Chinese Soviet Union, that determined the imperialists upon their present war to partition China and to lay the basis for an attack upon the Soviet Union. In India the revolutionary struggle, while not so advanced as in China, rapidly gains momentum. The masses of peasants and workers are beginning to break with the counter-revolutionary non-re- "},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"THE DECLINE OF CAPITALISM 61 distance policies of Ga ndhi, which paralyze their struggle and enable a hand ful of British troops to rule the country. Th e failure of the London Round Table Conference is being followed by a great intensification of re volutionary activity in India. Over 50,000 \"politicals\" are in jail. The newly-organized Communist party consolidates itself and strengthens its position. Great strikes, militant peasant movement s, etc., which sharpen to the point of armed cl ashes with the government, are the order of the day in India. And the revo- lutionary blaze will spread, despite the announced policy of the \"Socialist\" Ramsay MacDonald's gov- ernment to \"make a desert out of India.\" British imperialism and Indian capitalism have nothing to offer the Indian workers and peasants but starva- tion; and the inevitable re ply of the latter will be revolution. In Indo-China, controlle d by French imperial- ism, a similar revolutiona ry foment exists. De- spite terrific repression by French troops, there is a growing wave of strikes, mutinies, seizures of food supplies and local governments, leading to armed conflicts and guerilla warfare. In the North, where the influen ce of the Chinese revo- lution is strong, there ha s been the formation of local Soviets.

The conditions of the workers and peasants, in the deep industrial and agrarian crises, go from bad to worse. A growth of revolutionary spirit is everywhere evi- dent. During the past th ree years many govern- ments in South America ha ve been overthrown by coups d'etat. While th ese \"palace revolutions\" were largely engineered by American and British imperialism in their struggles against each other, they nevertheless had as a background the discon- tent of the masses. This discontent, by under- mining the strength and prestige of the existing governments, made it easy for rival imperialist agents to overthrow them . In recent months, how- ever, the struggles in Lati n America assume a more revolutionary character. The working class and radicalized peasantry are developing real mass movements. The Communist parties are becoming more and more the leader s. This development of revolutionary struggle in Latin America is exem- plified, among other even ts, by the Chilean Navy mutiny and general strike , the Peruvian general strikes and armed struggles, the big Cuban strikes and the revolutionary str uggles in Salvador.

The Revolutionary Perspective T HE GENERAL capitalist crisis heads inevitably, but not at the same speed in all countries, towards the revolutionary overthrow of the world capitalist system. To the American with a bourgeois out- look, such a perspective will seem remote indeed. The American capitalism that he comes in contact with appears strong and no revolutionary danger seems to loom from the toiling masses. But the perspective of revolution in general and in the United States in particular cannot be determined simply upon the basis of th e present si tuation in this country. American capitalism is part of the world capitalist system, subj ect to its general laws and bound up with its fate. This is the first point to be born e in mind. The second is Lenin's theory of the \"weakest link.\" The world capitalis t system, as Marx has taught us, is not of unifor m strength in all its parts. Hence, because of its une ven development in point of time, extent, etc., in th e several countries, it is like a chain of stronger and weaker links. The revolution advances, not by breaking the chain si- multaneously everywhere, but by beginning the break at the weakest links. Old Russia was such a "},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"64 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA weak link and the Russian revolution was such a break. The capitalist chain, with the progress of the general capitalist crisis, is becoming full of weak links. The entire chain is weakening. As we have seen, among the especially weak links are Germany, Spain, Poland, China, India, etc. So far has the capitalist cr isis developed in these countries that the toiling masses may make a revolutionary break thr ough at any time, with disastrous results upon the whole chain. Such revolutionary breaks may come either as an ac- companiment of imperia list war, or by the ma- turing gradually of the inner contradictions of capitalism in a given coun try, culminating in a struggle for power by the workers and toiling masses. And world capita lism is faced with im- minent danger from both these directions, which are, of course, intimatel y related to each other. The revolutionary danger to the capitalist sys- tem from the developing wa r situation is acute and menacing. If and when the imperialist powers launch a great war among themselves we may be sure that in many c ountries the workers and peasants, following the famous strategy of Lenin and under the leadership of the Communist Inter- national, will transform th e imperialist war into a civil war against the capitalist system. The World War of 1914-18 result ed in the formation "},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"THE DECLINE OF CAPITALISM 65 of the first Soviet Republic; another great war can well produce a Soviet Europe. Capitalism will run no less a danger for its existence when it launches its eventual attack upon the Soviet Union. The Ja panese were astounded at the brave resistance put up by the half-armed Chinese soldiers in Shanghai, fi ghting to defend their country from imperi alist invasion. And the capitalist powers that attack the Soviet Union will be doubly and fatally surprised when they go against the Red Army. They will learn that their drafted masses of workers and peasants will have no taste to fight their Ru ssian brothers; they will find out also that revolu tionary soldiers fighting for Socialism are worth ma ny times their number of toiler soldiers pressed into the service of capi- talism. The capitalists wi ll learn, finally, that they will have to face th eir aroused workers at home, for the defense of the Soviet Union will be carried out not only by the Red Army but by the militant working class all over the world. And the way this job will be done will bode ill for capi- talism. But the development of the revolution does not depend upon the in itiation of impe rialist war. As we have remarked, it also grows out of the sharp- ening of the economic a nd eventually political crisis within the given c ountries. This revolution- ary process now goes ahea d on a world scale with the deepening of the genera l crisis of capitalism. "},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"66 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA We have seen how rapi dly the revolution ap- proaches in this way in Germany and other countries. The proletarian revolution in Germany would be a deadly blow to th e whole capitalist system throughout the worl d. Such a revo lution would in all probability draw wi th it Poland and other countries on the Russian border. Thus, with the U.S.S.R., there would be cr eated a gigantic Soviet bloc. This great Soviet Union, supported by the growing revolutionary movement in the remaining capitalist countries, would be well able to defend itself from the inev itable military attacks of the capitalist imperialists. Mo re than that, it would certainly be in a dominant world position as against the decadent capitalist system. The center of gravity in the world relation of class forces would be shifted definitely on th e side of the revolution. These far-reaching possibilit ies are now, with the sharpening of the crisis in Germany, already within the scope of practical political perspectives.

George Bernard Shaw is right: the time will surely come when the victorious toilers will build a monument to Lenin in New York. It is upon the background of this growing gen- eral crisis of capitalism that the present economic crisis develops. That is why it is of such un- precedented scope, dept h and duration. Those who compare the prevailing crisis with the cycli- cal crises of the pre-wa r period are deluding them- selves, living in a r ealm of false hopes. The pre-war economic crises developed during the period of the upward trend of capitalism; the pres- ent one, although retaining the cyclical character, "},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"68 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA occurs during the decline of capitalism. The former liquidated themselves into wider circles of capitalist growth; the latt er leads to deepening crisis and decay. In view of all this, the questions arise: can the capitalists secure even a temporary respite from the onward march of the re volution by a revival of industry ? Is the present one the last crisis of capitalism ? In answering these questions there must be borne in mind th e considerations that, first, the present economic crisis is of a cyclical character, and, second, the question of the relation of forces between the wo rking class and the capi- talist class, with the possi bility of breaks at weak links in the capitalist chai n where the working class takes the revolutionary path. Where there is no strong revolutionary moveme nt the capita lists will find a way out at the expens e of the toiling masses; that is, the economic crisis , following the laws of cyclical crises, will eventu ally wear itself out by reducing production, slashi ng prices and wages and drastically reducing the living standards of the masses. But that such a turn will come soon or extend far is doubtful. Already, as we have seen, in the deepening general capitalist crisis, whole sections of the capitalist economy ha ve fallen into more or less chronic paralysis, a nd the tendency is for this paralysis to spr ead. The economic crises become "},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"THE DECLINE OF CAPITALISM 69 more frequent, more widesp read and more lasting. Varga points out, in illust rating the severity of the present crisis, that co ntrary to all previous experience: \"so far there has been in general no diminution of visible (wor ld) stocks; nay, some commodities even having increased in this re- spect.\" 28 Any recovery, therefore, that may be registered from the pres ent economic crisis can, at most, be only very partial and temporary in character. It must soon be followed by another crash still more far-reachi ng and devastating to the capitalist system. Capitalism is doomed. The capitalist system of private ownership of i ndustry and land, produc- t i o n for profit, and exploita tion of the workers is reaching the end of its course. It has outlived its historic mission. In its earlier stages capitalism was a progressive system; it constituted an ad- vance over feudalism, which preceded it. Under capitalism there has been bu ilt an industrial sys- tem, at least in the imperi alist countries; industrial technique has been devel oped; the proletariat has been created and discip lined. But even the lim- i t e d progress that capita lism has accomplished for humanity has been achieved at the cost of incred- ible misery, poverty, ignor ance and slaughter of the working class.

If you could stand exactly hehind your image in the glass and look out, your left hand would have to do what your right does when you face the mirror; you'd find your hair parted on the wrong side; you'd be compelled to wink one eye when you meant to wink the other. And in Foster's mirrored view of the USSR, that is the way things are. Nothing is what it seems. Foster's basic \"proof\" of the superiority of Com- munism is his hald insistence — in 1932 — that the USSR soon would outstrip the whole world in industry, agriculture, and th ings cultural. With in ten years, as- serts Foster flatly, the Soviet Union would lead all other nations. Considerably more than a quarter of a century later, the USSR still is making th at claim. During an ex- tremely important Moscow speech, 6 January 1961, Nikita Khrushchev shouted, \". . . hy 1965 the U.S.S.R. will outstrip the United States in volume of production, and will outstrip the United States in per capita pro- 2-A"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"2-B NOTES ON CHAPTER 2 duction by approximately 1970.\" In October of the same year, Khrushchev boasted to the Twenty-second Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union that by 1980 the USSR will be the foremost industrial nation of the world. Even if the Soviet should move into first place, in- dustrially, in 1980 (an altogether unlikely prospect in a world carpeted with the Kremlin's broken promises), that would put the USSR exactly thirty-eight years be- hind William Z. Foster's schedule. Having advanced glittering arguments about the wonders of Communist management, Foster seeks to sweep us away with a sudden spate of statistics. To examine them all would require at least an equal num- ber of pages. However, here is a sample. Within the Soviet Union, Foster promises \". . . The completion of 138 airlines with 100,000 miles of airways\" by the end of the year. If that is a triumph, it is only a triumph of brevity. One hundred and thirty-eight airlines flying a total of a hundred thousand miles means that each airline was only about seven hundred and fifty miles long — roughly the air distance between Beaumont, Texas, and El Paso, Texas. Another trick of reflection is Foster's use of com- parisons. For instance, he says that, in the production of electrical power, \". . . the Russian figure in 1937 will exceed that of the United States in 1929.\" The statement may even be technically true, but by this kind of logic, if the Soviet Union in 1970 has as much as one Polaris-type missile, it will boast that it has one hundred percent more Polari s-type missiles than the United States had in 1955 . . . before such weapons existed. Nevertheless, Foster insists that \". . . Planned econ- omy is one of the great contributions of Socialism "},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"NOTES ON CHAPTER 2 2-C [Communism] to humanity.\" Poor man, it is no easy task for William Z. Foster (or anyone else) to prove the virtues of economic and social planning. Even the plan- ners who have had the inside track through every ad- ministration in Washington since the very year in which TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA was published have had no romp to victory. It is true that they moved the United States far down the Socialist road — but the fact that we have not yet been dragged the full distance is a living monument to the doggedness with which Amer- ican Conservatives resist th e coming of an Orwellian 1984. Desperately, Foster in Chapter 2 strives to show that Communism is the solution to all the problems of the cosmos. To prove his claim, he points to Communism in action in the Soviet Union. Or let us say he appears to point to Communism in action in the Soviet Union. On closer inspection, it becomes clear that what he is pointing to is only what he says is Communism in action in the Soviet Union. There is a difference. Unfortunately, a wasteland of statistical arguments makes this part of the book the least interesting. It is not so much that the statistics are too far out of date to prove anything as that they never proved much to begin with. Foster claims, for example, that the end of Mos- cow's second Five-Year Plan \". . . will put the U.S.S.R. within hailing distance of the United States in the mat- ter of industrial output.\" (Sound familiar ?) About the only way in which the USSR could have come within industrial hailing distance of the United States, circa 1940, would have been with the assistance of a very large bull-horn. It certainly could not have made con- tact via its factories or machinery, any more than it is within long bellowing distance to this day.

In this chapter is the unblushing declaration that \". . . the Soviet Union, advancing with giant strides, is fairly running past the industrially stagnant and de- clining capitalist countries,\" a group which necessarily includes the USA. Now, the overthrow of Capitalism is to be accomplished, Foster has been claiming, by such things as outstripping the Un ited States industrially. Thus Red eflfrontery outdoes even itself when Comrade Foster objects, indignantly, that American businessmen weren't helping the Communists enough. For it was those same Communists who were out to cut American industrial throats, and Foster is the man who makes that plain: \" . . Were credits available,\" he asserts bitterly, \"they would double or triple their orders for machinery in the capitalist countries.\" We sold scrap iron to Japan before Pearl Harbor, too . . . with the Nipponese doubling and tripling their orders, when- ever we could fill them. You trade with your enemy at your peril, not his. As for agriculture, about wh ich Foster presents more of his the-world's-largest talk, the situation in the USSR is perhaps best summed up in the declaration by our Communist writer that \". . . The farmers are being proletarianized and revolutionized.\" With the health and happiness of the Soviet farmers in mind, this state- ment is ominous enough. Bu t it is rendered downright gruesome by the remark that accompanies it: \". . . The remnants of competitive, individualist farming are being liquidated, and the rich kulaks with them.\" The last part of the declaration just quoted covers one of the most staggeringly evil acts in the whole his- tory of crime. The liquidation of the kulaks will be a black page in the story of humankind for as long as there is anyone left to read it. "},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"NOTES ON CHAPTER 2 2-E The kulaks are Russian farmers who are just a little better off than most. Their death-knell began to sound early in 1930. That was when the compulsory collec- tivization of Soviet farms was launched. And that was when Dictator Stalin decr eed the \"liquidation of the kulaks as a class.\" In 1928, according to Soviet statistics, there were five million, six hundred and eighteen thousand kulaks. Six years later, in 1934, no more than a pitiful one hundred and forty-nine thousand remained. More than five million of the more intelligent, more provident, more competent peasants had been driven at gunpoint from their homes and jammed into cattle-cars for the long, slow, suffocating ride to government slave-labor camps in the northern part of Great Russia and the eastern portion of Siberia. T hose who resisted — pro- tested, even — were shot immediately, unless they were unlucky enough to be dragged off to a dungeon. That few of the millions of kula ks survived goes without saying. But, what was worse, the result of removing the kulaks was that another five million peasants who were not kulaks starved to death in the ghastly famine of 1932-1933 alone ... a famine induced as much by the removal of kulak skill and kulak ingenuity as by any act of Nature. It was a catastrophe so frightful that even cannibalism was not unknown. Stalin was not disturbed. He wanted the peasant farmers reduced in number. And reduced in number they were. In time, Marshal Stalin himself remarked that his agricultural collectivization cost the Soviet Union far more lives than the nation lost in World War II.

Comrade Foster gives no details concerning the por- tion of the kulak liquidation that had transpired by the time he wrote TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA. But he could have boasted that here was one field in which the Soviet Government held, and still holds, an undisputed global superiority — if that is the word for it. Yet William Z. Foster manages to level the unblush- ing charge, in Chapter 2, that \". . . mass starvation is a common phenomenon\" in the United States! And what of politics under Communism? Foster makes the important point that in the USSR \". . . only those doing useful labor\" are allowed to vote. But — vote for whom? There is one party, a single set of candidates. \"In a Socialist [Communist] society,\" Foster ex- plains, \". . . where the aim of the government is to ad- vance solely the interests of the toiling masses, there is room for only one Party, the Communist party.\" He is almost pathologically frank about it: \". . . what stupidity it would he for th e victorious workers, whose aim it is to liquidate all cl asses, to permit these counter- revolutionary elements to organize themselves into political parties and thus enable them to sabotage the new regime, to fight for the re-establishment of their system. . . .\" In other words, when you've got a man down, don't he a fool!

[the dread secret police] to defend the revolution against the cap- italist attacks from within and without.\" Despite which, Foster somehow finds the stomach to boast that \". . . The Communist party is the bearer of the first real democracy in the modern world.\" And science? Science among the Capitalists, as Foster tells it, is merely the slave of money. But in the Com- munist world, science is of course the freest, the purest, the most important, the best-equipped, the most pro- ductive, and whatever else anyone desires to make it, so long as they garland it with superlatives. How else could Russians have invented the airplane, the type- writer, the submarine, the telephone, the automobile, the printing-press, instalment buying, Christopher Co- lumbus, and the better mouse-trap? Religion is something else. Here the effort is not to make it the largest in the world, but the least. \"In the U.S.S.R., as part of the general cultural rev- olution,\" Foster explains calm ly, \"religion is being li- quidated. Religion, which Marx called, 'the opium of the people', has been a basic part of every system of exploitation that has afflic ted humanity — chattel slav- ery, feudalism, capitalism. It has sanctified every war and every tyrant, no matter how murderous and reac- tionary.

In the Soviet Union, where the economic and political foundations of Socialism have been laid, production is carried on for the soci al good, not for the profit of an exploiting class. What deter- mines the character and volume of production is not whether capitalists can sell it at a profit for themselves in a clogged ma rket, but the needs of the masses of people. Socialism thus liquidates the basic contradiction — that is, the production of social necessities for private profit — out of which originates all the mi series and chaos of capi- talism. Socialism thus re volutionizes the aim of production from production for profitable sale to production for social use. In so doing it frees humanity from the narrow limits of capitalist economy and embarks upon a totally new era of social development. This social advance is made in an orderly and intelligent way.

In the Soviet Union this systematic advance on every social front is pr oceeding under the famous Five-Year Plan. In a worl d thrown into deepen- ing disorder and demora lization by its growing general crisis, the superi ority of the system of planned Socialist economy stands out like a great mountain. Even the capita lists themselves are compelled to recognize it and they try vainly to adapt it to th e capitalist syst em.

This cripples their purchasing power, making the markets lag behind the more rapidl y expanding productive forces, and thereby causing over-production and economic crisis.

There can be no clogging of th e social economy with unsaleable surpluses of commodities. The way is wide open for continuous industrial growth. The economic crisis is a capita list thing foreign to So- cialist society. The expe rience in the U.S.S.R. proves this beyond ques tion. Not even the fact that the Soviet Union has to trade with capitalist countries, and therefor e feels the heavy downpull of their sagging industrie s and declining prices, has been able to disrupt its fundamentally sound Socialist economy. The existence in the Soviet Union of this con- stant and huge impulse for the development of the productive forces explains why it has no unemploy- ment and why its industries are developing at a pace totally unequalled in the whole world history of industry.

It was one gran d laughing stock. \"The Bolsheviks,\" the argument went, \"are losing their grip upon the masses, so now, to hold on a bit longer, they come forwar d with this fantastic project.\" Especially the Social Democrats dis- tinguished themselves in \"proving\" the \"absurdity\" of the Five-Year Plan. Kr amer, President of the Union of German Industrialists, typically ex- pressed capitalist world op inion when he said: \"If the Five-Year Plan could be realized in 50 years, it would be a magnificent achievement. But that is Utopian.\" The Russian Communist Party replied to this barrage of ridicule and cynicism by putting out the slogan, \"The Five-Year Plan in Four Years,\" and mobilized all possible forces to achieve this her- culean task.

We have not fulfilled the tasks in regard to the recon- struction of transport, in particular of railroad transport.\" These weak spots are now the center of special attack.

It is made possible by the sound economics of th e Socialist system, which makes for a rapid growth of the productive forces, by the determination of th e workers to build So- cialism (and thus prosperity) as quickly as pos- sible, by the pressure of the swiftly rising living standards and demands of the toilers, by the revo- lutionary enthusiasm of th e masses in building the industries, by the burning necessity to render the U.S.S.R. economically independent of the capital- ist world at the earliest possible period and to enable it to defend itself against the developing capitalist war attack, by the determination to show the workers of the world th e superiority of Social- ism over capitalism. One of the basic factors, as we have indicated, in the stormy advance of Russian industry is the blazing enthusiasm of the workers. They have this enthusiasm because they realize they are build- ing the great industrial system for their own bene- fit, not for a small clique of capitalist exploiters. Thus they have developed the celebrated \"Social- ist competition,\" by whic h factory an d factory, industry and industry, city and city, compete with each other in comradely ri valry to carry through sooner and better their production plans.

The workers submit their \"c ounter-plans\" of production against those formulated by the industry heads. Examples: In the \"Electric Apparat\" plant in Leningrad the management planned a 72,000,000 ruble output for this year , whereupon the workers presented their counter-plan to increase the output to 94,500,000 rubles; the gr eat Saratov agricultural machine plant was official ly scheduled to begin operations by Jan. 1, 1932, but the workers' counter-plan called for a production of 200 ma- chines daily by that date.

And the joke of it all is that only a year or two ago the Communists were universally con- demned by capitalist wise acres as hopeless tyros industrially. Now they are teaching the whole world an entirely new perspective of industrial possibilities. The Revolution in Agriculture I F S OCIALISM proceeds with great speed in indus- try, it goes still faster in agriculture. The vast development of the producti ve forces and the re- organization generally that is taking place with almost lightning speed in Russian agriculture is something altogether ne w in the world. During the 30 days from Jan. 20 to Feb. 20, 1930, one- third of all the peasants entered the collective farms in the monster orga nization campaign, rais- ing the total of collec tivized homesteads from 4,300,000 to 14,000,000 at one stroke. Anna Louise Strong thus describes this tremendous movement: \"Can one give a smooth account of an earthquake ? The storm of collectivization that I found on the Lower Volga in late November, 1929, was as elemental as an ea rthquake, as a tidal wave, as a whirlwind.\" 8 The Five-Year Plan was completed in two years in the collectivized farms, in three years in the 8 The Soviets Conquer Wheat, p. 24."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"THE RISE OF SOCIALISM 89 State farms. The Plan called for 20% of all farms to be collectivized by the end of 1933; al- ready there are 62% and this year will raise it to 75%, which will practically complete the most im- portant districts. Ther e were 1,000,000 collec- tivized farms in 1929, now there are 22,000,000 organized into 200,000 coll ectives; there were 143 State farms in 1930, now there are 4,000, or far in excess of the quota called for by the Five-Year Plan. Duranty says (N. Y. Times, Jan. 2, 1932) that nine-tenths of the ch ief grain centers are al- ready collectivized. These new farms are huge in size. In 1927 the average size of Russian farms was 11 acres, now it is 973. The State farms range as large as 100,- 000 to 200,000 acres; the co llectives are still more gigantic, some running as great as 500,000 acres of cultivated land, exceedi ng thus in size by four or five times the biggest farms in any other coun- try in the world. Whole districts have become practically single farms, worked in common by the organized farmers. Russian farming is fair ly leaping ahead from a condition of almost mediev al primitiveness to the most advanced in the world. In many parts of the Soviet Union farming methods of 2,000 years ago were still in use up till the great drive for col- lectivization. Even close to Moscow things were not much better. Says A. L. Strong: \"In the district of Ivoshira, onl y three hours by rail from "},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"90 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA Moscow, a survey made in 1930 of farm equipment showed a population of 62,000 souls and some 6,200 plows, of which 2,65 9 were of the home-made wooden style.\" But so swif t is the pace of develop- ment that Kalinin could sa y on Mar. 6, 1931, at the Sixth Congress of Soviets: \"In industry great may be the advance in co mparison with our back- ward past, we are still only striving to overtake the technical development of more advanced coun- tries. But in farming we are leaders on a new road. Here we go before all nations.\" The farms are being rapidly and scientifically mechanized. Lenin said: \"If 100,000 first class tractors could be produced and supplied with gaso- line and tractorists tomorro w (and you know that this is still but a fantasy ), the middle peasant would say: 'Yes, I am for the commune,' that is, for Communism.\" Well, the tr actors are now in the fields, 150,000 of them, and the middle peasants are practically won for So cialism, as Lenin fore- saw. One of the revoluti onary features of the new mechanization is th e \"tractor stations.\" These are centers that fu rnish machinery and re- pairs, instruction, recreatio n, etc., to the peasants. In Dec, 1931, there were 1400 of them; in 1932, 1700 more are being orga nized, thus covering the entire country with a network of farm machine local centers, radiation point s of all that is needed to build the new farming a nd Socialism.

Already, although the general movement is just getting under way, vast im provements are to be registered in farming resu lts. In three years there has been a 21% increase in the total cultivated area. The cotton acreag e now amounts to three times pre-war, and other i ndustrial crops show ac- cordingly. Despite a still great lack of machinery and fertilizer, the yield on the collectives runs from 25% to 50% better than on the old individual farms. The year 1931 wa s a drought period; for- merly it would have produ ced a famine, but with collectivized farming the general output equalled the previous year. In 1932 there will be a further stimulation of the whole movement. The total new capital in- vestment in the Socialist se ctor of agriculture will be 4,360,000,000 rubles instead of the 3,600,000,000 in 1931. There will be in creases of the State cattle ranches of 40%, St ate piggeries 200%, State sheep ranches 40%, cott on sowing 14%, sugar beets 13%, spring wheat 5%, and a myriad of other developments of agricultural production.

The coll ectivized farms lay a solid So- cialist basis in the coun try. The remnants of competitive, individualist farming are being liqui- dated, and the rich kulak s with them. The farms are being mechanized and industrialized, the unity of city and country established. The workers in the cities and on the farm s are being knitted into one solid working class.

The winning of the \"fundamentally anti-Socia list\" middle peasants to Socialism has been practically accomplished.

It is com- pelled to see that the Sovi et Union, advancing with giant strides, is fairly ru nning past the industrially- stagnant and declini ng capitalist countries. \"In the U.S.S.R.,\" says Premier Molotov, \"24 new blast furnaces were st arted in 1931, while 29 were closed down in th e United States from Janu- ary to September of the same year.\" \"In the U.S.S.R.,\" states Brand, \"we are building work- shops, in Europe and the United States they are closing them down; the U. S.S.R. is launching new ships, in Hamburg, L ondon and New York ships are being converted into scrap iron.\" In 1931, while the Soviet Union was advancing its general industrial production 21%, that of the capitalist countries declined on an average of 25%. Since 1928 Russian industrial production has increased 86%, and that of the capit alist world has fallen 29%. 9 While the national inco me of the U.S.S.K. increased 14% in 1931, th e general drop in capital- ist countries ran from 15% to 20%.

In the steel industry it is overt aking one capitalist coun- try after another; in 1929 Belgium was passed, in 1931 England was outdista nced, only three coun- tries now being ahead of the Soviet Union in steel, and they also are being rapidly overhauled. In the matter of total national income the U.S.S.R. now stands second in the world, its figure of 38 billions for 1931 bei ng twice that of 1913 and exceeding the pre-crisis fi gures for Germany, Great Britain and France. In total volume of i ndustrial production the U.S.S.R. also occupies second place. The Eco- nomic Review of the Sovi et Union (Apr.

The XVII Party Conference of the C.P.S.U. says in its resolution: \"In the s econd Five-Year Plan the Soviet Union will advan ce to the first place in Europe in regard to technique.\" The purpose of the new plan is to \"tra nsform the whole national economy and to create the most modern technical basis of all branches of national economy.\" The first Five-Year Plan grea tly frightened the capi- talist world; the second in creases its demoralization. The tremendous scope of the second Five-Year Plan may be realized from the fact that it provides for a total new capital investment of 150 billion rubles, or about 78 billi on dollars. What this gigantic sum means in th e way of development is indicated by the comparis on that it is equal to three times the I.C.C. valu ation of the total rail- road mileage of the United States — 26 billion dol- lars, a figure which includes one-third to one-half of watered values. Some of the details of the immense second Five- Year Plan are the following: the development of six times as much electr ical power in 1937 as in 1932, extension of the machine building industry 3 1/2 times, increase of coal production from 90 million tons in 1932 to 250 million in 1937, 300% increase in the production of oil, the yearly pro- duction of 22 million tons of pig iron, (requiring a tempo of development twice as fast as that of the United States and Germany in their best days), "},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"96 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA an output of 170,000 tractors per year, the build- ing of 30,000 kilometers of railroads, accompanied with a complete reorganiza tion, including the estab- lishment of the block sy stem, automatic couplers, bigger locomotives and cars, new bridges, extensive electrification, etc. The main aim will be to build the heavy industries and power base, but the light industries will also be developed 200% to 300%. In agriculture similar great advances will be made, including a large extension of the sown area (cot- ton and flax 100%, sugar beets 200%, etc.), com- plete collectivization of th e land, complete mechan- ization of the main branch es of agriculture and the beginnings of electrificati on, including the electri- cal stimulation of plant gr owth, a huge increase of livestock, a large expans ion of wheat production to insure against drought years, the construction of automobile roads on a vast scale, etc., etc. The Party resolution expresse s \"the firm conviction that the main tasks of th e second Five-Year Plan will not only be fulfilled, but even surpassed.\" The accomplishment of this stupendous plan of development will put the U.S.S.R. within hailing distance of the United States in the matter of in- dustrial output. In one fundamental (not to mention many lesser ones), that of the production of electrical power, the Russian figure in 1937 will exceed that of the Un ited States in 1929. En- gineer C. A.

By that time Lenin's famous slogan, \"to overtake and surpass the most advanced capi- talist countries,\" will be fully realized. Real Prosperity for the Toilers B UT THE Soviet Union is not only rapidly increas- ing its industrial and ag ricultural production; it is at the same time build ing an industrial (and social) system superior in structure and function to that of capitalism. Instead of a hodge-podge of competitive and unprogr essive industry and agriculture, it is creatin g a great, modern, pro- gressive industrial-agricultu ral machine; instead of a profit-making apparatus to fatten a few while millions starve, it is build ing its industries for the benefit of the producing masses. That is why the Soviet Union is a land of no strikes. That is why the Russian workers and peasants are toiling so resolutely to build their new industrial system, un- deterred by either the appa lling difficulties of an undeveloped economy or the endless obstacles placed in their way by th e world capitalist enemy. The growth of Socialism marks the birth of the 10 New York Times, Feb. 19, 1932."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"98 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA first era of prosperity for the workers. Under capitalism everywhere weal th piles up automat- ically in the hands of th e parasitic owners of the industries, while the ma sses of actual producers live at the bare suhsistenc e line. But in the Social- ist Soviet Union all this is fundamentally changed. There production is carried on for the benefit of those who actually work. There are no artificial limits placed upon production by the need to sell in a clogged mark et. Hence product ive forces de- velop freely and rapidly, and as production in- creases the added output inev itably translates itself into higher wages, shorte r hours, better working conditions, more elaborate cultural institutions, etc., for the toilers. \"T here are no beggars or lines of unemployed in S oviet streets — no rent evictions, no ragged despai r,\" says Duranty. One of the most infamous and ridiculous capitalist lies against the Soviet Union is that the Russian work- ers are \"exploited.\" How can they possibly be \"exploited\" when there is no ruling, owning class, no class to get a rake-off from the worker's pro- duction ? 11 It is a revolutionary fact of first importance that only in the Soviet Union, of all the world, are the conditions of the toilers now being improved. In every respect they are adva ncing, while in all capi- talist countries, the United States included, the 11 A typically absurd argument against Socialism is made in The Forum, Nov., 1931, by Andre Maurois that, \"a permanent better- ment of standards will again build up a bourgeoisie.\" "},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"THE RISE OF SOCIALISM 99 standards of the workers have catastrophically de- clined, until mass starvati on is a comm on phenome- non. The workers everywhere, penetrating the lies of capitalism, are be ginning to understand the significance of this rise of workers' standards under Socialism and their dec line under capitalism. That is the reason millions of them want to go to the Soviet Union; it explains why the working class everywhere is more and more looking to the Soviet Union as the guide it must follow in its fight for freedom and prosperity. The main task of all cap italist governments is the suppression and expl oitation of the toiling masses; but the very reas on-for-being of the revo- lutionary Soviet government is the fundamental improvement of the condi tions of these masses. This, characteristically, th e Soviet government does according to plan. Not on ly is the development of industry and agriculture the object of the State planning, but also the systematic improvement of wages, hours, living and cu ltural conditions, etc. Up till now, in or der to lay a solid Socialist founda- tion for real worker prosperity, the government has had to apply every possible energy and re- source to the development of industry. Neverthe- less, it has been able to accomplish profound bet- terments in the worker s' conditions. Let us briefly review some of them: Unemployment, that te rror of the capitalist system, has no place in a Socialist system. The "},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"100 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA consuming power of the masses keeps pace with and outstrips their pro ducing power. Hence, unemployment has been wiped out in the Soviet Union. The right to work , alien and unknown to capitalist society, has be en fully established. While millions of hungry workers desperately seek employment in capit alist countries, in the Soviet Union every worker has a job. And it will so remain. From 1922 to 1928 there was consid- erable unemployment in th e Soviet Union, despite the steady growth of industry and increase in the number of workers employed, this being caused by large numbers of workers coming from the villages to the cities. Originally , the Five-Year Plan did not contemplate the comple te elimination of un- employment by 1932. Nevert heless, this has been accomplished. Moreover, ther e is a huge shortage of workers in every indu stry. The working class, the most basic element in the productive forces of society, either stagnant or actually declining in numbers in capitalist count ries, is rapidly on the increase in the Soviet Union. In 1927, there were (except agricultural) 8, 866,000 workers and in 1930, 12,429,000. The last year of the Five-Year Plan, 1933, called for a gr and total of 15,800,000 workers, but this year the number has already reached 18,700,000. In 193 2 another 3 millions will be added, raising the total to over 21 millions or 133% of the Plan. T hus the very basis of the "},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"THE RISE OF SOCIALISM 101 revolution, the working cla ss, is being enormously strengthened, and that, too, by plan. Under Socialism wages are as high as the total economy will permit; under capitalism they are as low as the workers can be compelled to accept. Hence, with the rapidly expanding economy in the U.S.S.R,., wages are swiftly on the increase, in contrast to rapid wage declines in all capitalist countries. In the U.S.S. R. average yearly wages (except in agriculture) were; 1927 — 729 rubles, 1930 — 956 rubles, 1931 — 1010 rubles. Calculat- ing upon the principles of purchasing power and socialized wages, (which include social insurance, vacations, etc.), the wage s of Russian workers are now about double what they were before the revo- lution. And the tempo of wage advance becomes ever faster in the Soviet Union, as the general economy expands, even as the rate of wage decline increases in the industrially decaying capitalist lands. Last year the Russian average wage in- crease was 18%, in 1932 it is planned to be 27%. 12 The final year of the Five-Year Plan called for a total wage fund of 15,700 ,000,000 rubles; but in 1931 it had already reached 21,000,000,000 and in 1932 it will be 26,800,000,000, or 171% fulfillment of the Plan. In the question of wages the prin- ciple of \"overtaking and surpassing\" the capitalist countries also applies. The Russians in this re- 12 Associated Press dispatches of Mar. 31, 1932, announce a gen- eral wage increase of 11% to 20% in all the light and heavy indus- tries of the U.S.S.R.

In all likelihood, considering the incomes of the working class as a whole, the sec ond Five-Year Plan, which will at least double the wages of the workers, will put the Russian workers in the lead of the whole world. In the question of the short working period, the Russian workers already ar e in the forefront of the world's working class.

In the U.S.S.R the maximum workday is 8 hours, with the 6-hou r day for the youth and workers in dangerous and unhealthy trades (mines, chemicals, etc.,); in the United States the sky is the limit for hours, with the 10-hour day widespread, 53% of the wo rkers in the steel in- dustry working 10 to 12 hours daily and 27% working the 7-day week, 13 little or no limitations upon the hours of youth an d women workers, etc. The Five-Year Plan cont emplated completing the introduction of the 7-hour day by the end of 1933, but this also will be acco mplished in four years, at 13 Labor Fact Book, p. 87."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"THE RISE OF SOCIALISM 103 present about 90% of the industrial workers being upon the 7-hour day basis or less. In the capital- ist countries, despite the huge unemployment, there is actually a tendency to increase the length of the working day; whereas, of course, in the Socialist Soviet Union the working day is constantly being cut. The second Five-Year Plan will make the 6-hour day practically universal in the Soviet Union. The social insurance of the Russian workers, already the most comprehens ive in the world, also is being rapidly developed. It covers every form of disability — sickness , accident, unemployment, old age, child-birth, etc., et c.,— and is fast reach- ing the stage of full wages under all conditions of disemployment. In the ca pitalist countries, as part of the program of thrusting the burden of the crisis upon the shoulders of the working class, the workers' benefits unde r State social legislation are being drastically reduced. In the Soviet Union, of course, the re verse is the case. Even the radical provisions of th e Five-Year Plan in this field are being greatly exceeded in accomplish- ment; the Plan provided th at the social insurance budget for 1933 should be 1,900,000,000 rubles; as a matter of fact, howev er, it had re ached 2,500,- 000,000 already in 1931, and will mount to 3,400,000,000 in 1932, or a bout double the original Plan figure. \"Russia,\" sa ys Rep.

The health and safety of the workers, in indus- try and in social life generall y, is in the very nature of Socialism a first concern of the Soviet govern- ment. Tremendous progress is being made in these fields. In the same series of articles, Siro- vich says, \"Russia has a widespread and thorough health program. The Co mmissariat of Health gathers the best medical knowledge in the world and places it free of charge at the disposal of the Russian people.\" While in capitalist countries, under the pressure of the speed-up system in in- dustry, unemployment, lo w wages, undernourish- ment, etc., accidents pile up in industry and the health of the working cla ss is undermined; in the Soviet Union just the reve rse tendencies are mani- fest. The old-time plague s of choler a and typhus are now only terrible memories; the health of the masses is being scientifical ly cultivated. Industry is being made safe and healthy. No workers in the world have the vacatio ns with pay, free rest homes and sanatoria, free medical services, etc., that the Russian work ers have. In 1929 the Soviet government spent 54,500,000 rubles for safety and sanitation in i ndustry; in 1931 this work absorbed 124,000,000 rubl es, and further huge im- "},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"THE RISE OF SOCIALISM 105 provements are planned. For the general health services, including sport, the national budget for 1932 calls for 1,737,000,000 rubles. Such figures, of course, do not include the hundreds of millions more spent by the local Soviets. The housing problem in the Soviet Union is a se- vere one, what with the he terogeneous collection of miserable shacks left over from the Czarist regime and the terrific growth of urban population. But this problem is also be ing solved rapidly. The national government housi ng program, which does not include innumerable la rge local projects, in- creases in volume from year to year: in 1926 it amounted to 292,000,000 r ubles; in 1931, 1,117,- 000,000; and in 1932 it will be 2,892,000,000. Whole new cities are bei ng built from the ground up, and the old ones rebui lt, on Socialist lines. Under the State Institute for City Planning 100 of such gigantic build ing projects are being pushed. Never was pla nned city building car- ried out upon such a huge scale. Such places as Leningrad and Ni zhni-Novgorod are being rebuilt into model Socialist cities , with great systems of schools, theatres, clubs, muni cipal baths, libraries, athletic fields, factory k itchens, laundries, crema- toriums, stadiums, hospita ls, refrigeration plants, etc. Besides, Socialist cities are also being built in the country, the most striking of these being the already famous \"Socialist Farm City\" of Filanova. This city, to be completed by 1934 , will contain a "},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"106 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA population of 60,000, now s cattered in 127 villages, and it will have all modern facilities. The whole district will be one great farm, the toilers living in the city and going to thei r work in automobiles. This revolutionary city is being built in a district where the peasants are just emerging from the darkness of the middle ages. The improved living sta ndards of the workers are paralleled by similar a dvances in the peasants' conditions. The whole villag e life is being trans- formed. More food, better clothing, better hous- ing, a raised standard of living generally is the order of the day in the country. The collective farm movement is freeing the peasants from the hopeless drudgery of the past; it is giving them a much greater return for th eir work; it brings edu- cation and a new cu lture; it makes a huge saving in labor power wh ich is being used to rebuild and modernize the whole life in the country. The Russian peasants are now taking the most gigantic and swiftest steps forwar d in culture and well- being ever made in any c ountry in the history of the world. The general rise in Russian living standards is manifested by a large increase in consumption of the more nutritious foods . The consumption of meat, for example, has increased 25 % in four years, with a further h eavy increase planned for in 1932. The production of eggs and potatoes, exceeded last year by 20% to 50%; the produc- "},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"THE RISE OF SOCIALISM 107 tion of meat, butt er, sunflower seed s and linseed by 50 % to 100 % ; that of poultry and tobacco 100%. Whereas government expert s in the United States are now teaching the workers how to live on a few cents a week, while masses of foodstuffs rot in the warehouses, the Soviet government is bending every effort to increase food production — which automatically means to in crease consumption. In 10 years it is planned to quadruple the present number of cattle, sheep and hogs. The resolution of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet government says: \"In the year 1932, the fund allotted to goods intended for mass consumption will be greatly increase d. This fund is rising (computed according to the retail prices of last year) from 27,200,000,000 rubles to 35,000,000,- 000. That is to say, th e retail turnover of the Socialist sector increas es 30%.\" What govern- ment other than that of the U.S.S.R., would thus plan the betterment of th e toilers' conditions ? The second Five -Year Plan will greatly accel- erate the rise in Russia n living standards. This will be possible with the more developed industrial base. Wages will be doubled or tripled. The six- hour day will become almost universal. The social insurance system will reach the stage of full wages for every form of disability. Production of consumption goods will be enormously increased. Vast housing plans will be completed. The reso- lution of the XVII confer ence of the Communist "},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"108 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA Party of the Soviet Union provides: \"In the light industries and in the food industries production is to be extended and a th ree-fold incr ease in the standard of consumption of the population is to be secured.\" The Russian workers and peasants, it is true, are still poor. This poverty is their heritage from Czarism and capitalism. Bu t with control of the industries and the land, with capitalist exploita- tion and robbery stopped, with rapidly developing Socialist industries and farm s, they have the solid basis for such a prosperity as no working class in the world has ever even remotely approached. The rapidity with which this prosperity will de- velop and its great dept h and breadth will soon astound the world. Capita lists everywhere under- stand this. They sense th e revolutionizing effect it will have upon the millions of workers in their countries who, in the growing crisis of the capi- talist system, are falling deeper and deeper into poverty and starvation. Th is is the basic reason why the capitalists are redou bling their efforts to develop war against the Soviet Union. The Cultural Revolution T HE PROLETARIAN revolution ushered a new era of social culture into what was old Russia. Culture, instead of being the monopoly of the few ex- ploiters and a tool to main tain their class rule, has "},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"THE RISE OF SOCIALISM 109 now become the boon of the broad masses, and a means for their emancipa tion. Instead of being designed to make intellectual slaves of the toilers, as is always the aim of th e capitalist \"culture,\" the new culture in the Soviet Union is free and scien- tific. For the first time in history the working masses have a chance to understand life and to enjoy the intellectual trea sures that modern condi- tions are able to produce. It is a veritable cultural revolution which, in the ne xt few years, by drawing out the repressed intell ectual capacities of the masses under the c onditions of Socialism, will pro- foundly transform every feature and phase of human thought and intellectual activity. The Russian revolu tion is giving the greatest stimula- tion to science, literature, music, the theatre, etc., that the world has ever known. In the Soviet Union the foundations of the new culture are being laid by a huge campaign of popu- lar education. This is also being conducted ac- cording to the principles of Socialist planning. In providing for the building of great factories, the Five-Year Plan also utilizes the new industrializa- tion for the education of the masses. Mass educa- tion in the Soviet Union assumes the aspect of a great \"cultural offensive\" which also develops with \"Bolshevik tempo.\" Even foreign capitalistic observers must remark th e breadth and depth of this unprecedented movement. Duranty cor- rectly says, (New York Times, Dec. 1, 1931): "},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"110 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA \"There seems to be no pa rallel in history to the drive for learning in all branches of knowledge, from reading and writing to the abstruse sciences, now in progress in the Soviet Union.\" Before the revolution only about 7,000,000 chil- dren attended school; now there are 23,000,000. The whole school system is growing by leaps and bounds; the teaching is accor ding to the most scien- tific methods, it is carrie d on in 70 languages, there being over 100 peoples goi ng to make up the Soviet Union. A system of compulsory schooling has been adopted and everyw here applied. In the secondary schools there are now eight times as many pupils as in pre-war days. All told, 46,000,- 000 people, one-third of the population, are at- tending educational ins titutions. In 1932 the national government budget calls for an expendi- ture of 9,200,000,000 rubles for social-cultural enterprises. This is aside from a veritable net- work of educational instit utions of the Communist party, the Communist Yo uth League, the trade unions, cooperatives, factories, the Red Army, etc. There is a whole deluge of books pouring from the printing presses, the Sovi et Union being already the world leader as a publ isher of books — not to speak of their superior quality. The theatre, the swiftly-growing ra dio and motion pict ures, are also tremendous educational instruments. One of the great achievemen ts of this vast work is the rapid wiping out of illiteracy. In 1913 only "},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"THE RISE OF SOCIALISM 111 25% above the age of 10 could read; 90% of women were illiterate. Illiteracy has now been practically eliminated fro m the industrial centers and it will also soon go fr om the villages. By the end of 1932 illiteracy is to be liquidated com- pletely. The fight agains t illiteracy is not simply a matter of the regular ed ucational institutions; a real assault is being made upon it by the more educated sections of the masses under the historic slogan, \"Literate, Teach the Illiterate.\" The struggle against illiterac y and for education in general keeps pace with th e growth of industry and the collectivization of th e farms. Thus in those districts where th e collectivization is well advanced the whole body of illiterates are undergoing in- struction. But the cultural revolution, as we have already indicated, is much more than merely giving the masses an elementary educa tion. It is also more significant than simply a rapid extension of schools, scientific institutes, theat res, etc., that is now taking place in the Soviet Union. It is a pro- found revolution in a ll culture. A whole new cultural system is being born. Under capitalism science is a slave to the class interests of the bourgeoisi e. Thus biology justi- fies the mad class struggle and war; economics puts an unqualified blessing up on wage slavery; history proves that capitalism is society perfected; psy- chology explains away poverty on the basis of "},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"112 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA inferior beings, etc. Capitalist science is also a veritable fortress of metaphys ical concepts of every kind. But Socialism strike s all these fetters from science. The working class exploits no subject class. Therefore, it has no interest to degrade science into a subtle system of propaganda, but on the contrary to give it the freest possible develop- ment. Marxian dialectical materialism destroys the metaphysics that para lyzes bourgeois science. Capitalist scien ce is planless and anarchic, the hit-or-miss task of whoe ver may be. But Social- ism organizes science. In the Soviet Union scien- tific work is being done on a planned basis, with full government support. There is a special Scientific Research Sect or of the Supreme Eco- nomic Council. Bukharin sa ys: \"The plan of So- cialist construction is not only a plan of economy; the process of the rationali zation of life , beginning with the suppression of ir rationality in the eco- nomic sphere, wins away from it one position after another; the principle of planning invades the realm of mental production, the sphere of science, the sphere of theory.\" 14 Capitalist science sets up a metap hysical separa- tion of theory and practi ce, and a corresponding arbitrary division of intell ectual from ma nual labor. It is based upon a caste theory and do es not de- velop the creative abilit ies of the masses. But Socialism liquidates this reactionary system.

In the U.S.S.R., as part of the general cultural revolution, religion is be ing liquidated. Religion, which Marx called, \"the opi um of the people,\" has been a basic part of every system of exploitation that has afflicted humanity — chattel slavery, feu- dalism, capitalism.

Religion is now in deep crisis throughout the"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"114 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA capitalist world. The quarre ls between \"modern- ists\" and \"fundamentalists \" in American churches are one form of this crisis. Religion, born in a primitive world, finds it extremely difficult to sur- vive in a world of indust ry and great cities. When capitalism was young and str ong its great scien- tists, the Darwins, Spen cers and Huxleys, were Atheists; but capitalism, grown decrepit and in crisis, tries to preserve religion in order to check the rebellion of the worker s. This is why Einstein (\"cosmic religion\"), Millikan, Eddington, and other bourgeois scientists now are trying so dili- gently to \"harmonize science and religion.\" In the U.S.S.R., as it must be in any Socialist country, religion dies out in the midst of the grow- ing culture.

But the workers have overcome all these \"im- possibilities.\" One of the most stubborn of all the problems they have had to meet is that of securing an adequate supply of re liable managers, engi- neers, technicians and sk illed workers, of building 10 Russia in the Shadows."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"THE RISE OF SOCIALISM 119 up whole new industrial ca dres. This problem has been attacked in various ways; the old engineers have been disciplined and paid highly, foreign spe- cialists have been br ought in, including many Americans; but the basic approach to the problem is the education of new cadres of industrial tech- nicians. This is being done on a huge scale. In 1931 there were 21,000 engi neers and technicians graduated; in 1932 there will be 38,000. In 1932 it is planned to graduate from technical colleges and schools of all kinds 175,000, from \"rabfaks\" (workers' faculties) 121, 000, from factory schools 364,000. By the end of 1932 there will be a grand total of 4,000,000 students in technical colleges, rabfaks, factory schools, etc., as against 2,700,000 in 1931. One of the most striking developments in this direction is the So ciety of Worker Inventors, with 700,000 members, at the recent Congress of which the slogan was put forward of, \"Save one billion rubles for th e U.S.S.R. in 1932.\" In the second Five-Year Pl an it is planned to train 1,500,000 technician s and specialists and to give technical instruction to from six to seven mil- lion workers. Such meas ures have cracked the backbone of this gigantic problem. But the need for skilled technical help in the Soviet Union is still a burning one.

In Feb., 1931, Stalin, at a great national work- ers' production congress, declared: \"The Bolsheviks must become masters of technique ! It is said that technique is difficult. Untrue ! There are no fortresses that Bolshevi ks cannot capture. We have solved a series of most formidable problems. We have overthrown capitalism. We have seized power.

The New York Times, D ec. 1, 1931, declares: \"The Stalingrad plant began work with 10,000 hands, a great majority of whom were peasants, mostly illiterate, many of whom had never seen a machine.\" It is in the face of such unparalleled difficulties that the Russian work ers are building Socialism. And what has since happened in this plant, the \"failure\" of which was gleefully hailed all over the capitalist world ? Duranty says fur- ther: \"In Stalingrad toda y the latest American machinery is being handled by girls of 20 no less efficiently than by men in the factories of Detroit.\" The official production reco rds show for the latter months of 1931: Aug. 1866 tractors, Sept. 2151, Dec. 2735, Feb. 2875, thus bringing the plant to a full program basis.

Duranty says (New York Times, Jan. 2, 1932), \"1931 did for the first time demonstrate that the Soviet Union no t only could build great producing units but could operate them success- fully.\" And lo, another great capitalist \"impos- sibility\" has gone to smas h in the face of the revolution. Almost overnight the Russian work- ers have mastered ma ss production. The whole history of capitalist deve lopment cannot register an equal achievement. But the extra-special, grand \"impossibility\" confronting the revolution was to win the peas- antry to Socialism. This, indeed, it was said, was utterly out of the question. The great masses of farmers, making up an overwhelming majority of the population, were hopele ssly attached to the institutions of private property and bred-in-the- bone enemies of Socialism. Sooner or later they were bound to organize and drown out the Com- munist party and all its works. How the world capitalists and their Socialist allies gloated over this pros pect; how they depended upon the peasants as thei r great ace-in-the-hole. But alas, it was not to be; the Russian workers and peasants also found the answer to this terrific problem in the gi gantic growth of collectivized farming. This has not only won the masses of middle peasants for Social ism but has enabled the practical liquidation of the rich kulaks as a class. Driven from one propaganda \"impossibility\" to"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"THE RISE OF SOCIALISM 123 another by the achievemen ts of the revolution, capitalist apologists are now hard-pressed to find new \"arguments.\" An example of their bank- ruptcy was given by Isaac Don Levine in a recent series of sensationalized articles in the New York American. The thesis of Le vine is that the capi- talists should not worry ov er the successes of the Five-Year Plan because th e Soviet Union has no basic natural resources a nyhow and the whole busi- ness is hollow and unimpo rtant. Levine, after a reckless twisting, misrep resenting and distorting of official Soviet reports , says: \"Singularly poor in iron, copper, gold and silver, the Soviet Union lacks the four es sential metals for the attainment of the goals set by Stalin 's jazzed edition of the Five-Year Plan.\" He says further: \"The iron found above ground in Ameri ca in the form of ma- chinery, buildings and e quipment, exceeds all the reserves, visible and possibl e, in the immense terri- tory of the Soviet Uni on.\" Then he goes on to negate the supply of coal and water power in the Soviet Union, to belittle its oil and timber reserves, etc., reducing the U.S.S.R. to a beggarly country indeed in point of resources. Now what are the facts ? First of all, it must be borne in mind that th e U.S.S.R. has been as yet but sketchily prospected for its mineral wealth. It is only now that this wo rk is being systematically undertaken, and almost daily reports arrive of the discovery of new resources. Already, with vast "},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"124 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA regions still practically unexplored, the U.S.S.R. has known raw materials resources of gigantic, if not unequalled proportions.

Besides this, however, there are rich, undeveloped deposits in Siberia, stretc hing over an area as large as Belgium.

(3) Water power: already, as we have seen, the second Five- Year Plan definitely prov ides for a greater elec- trical power development than that of the United States, the most of it from water projects, and with much still undeveloped. The Angara River power possibilities are 30 times as much as the great Dnieperstroy. ( 4 ) Iron: the largest iron ore deposits in the world are the new Kursk fields; Prof. Gubkin (Soviet Y earbook, 1930), estimates these at 40 billion tons of high class ore, and says, \"Preliminary computations permit us to conjec- ture that the Kursk iron ores will probably double the known world resources of iron ore.\" (5) Cop- per: until recently the kno wn supplies were lim- ited; but large deposits have lately been found in "},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"THE RISE OF SOCIALISM 125 Kazakstan, and in Feb., 1932, a great new field was reported from the Okhostk-Udsk region, with deposits of rich quality and extending over 20 square kilometers.

The capitalist arguments th at \"it is impossible\" also found their echoes with in the Communist party of the Soviet Union, wh ere they reflected the despair of the defeated and declining capitalist remnants in the U.S.S. R. Their outspoken rep- resentative was Trotzky. He formulated theories that it was impossible to build Socialism in one country — that first the world revolution was nec- essary; that the Party wa s degenerating and sur- rendering to a rapid growth of capitalist elements in city and country; that the Socialist industry development was destined to go on in a declining curve of new production; that the Soviet Union had abandoned th e world revoluti on, etc. The logic of his position would have led to the precipi- "},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"126 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA tation of aborti ve and fatal Communist revolts abroad and disastrous ci vil war at home against the great middle masses of peasants. All this would have surely defeated the revolution. Such, in brief, was the \"left\" deviation, which was Menshevism in thin disguise, an opportunist retreat from the hard struggle under cover of \"left\" phrases. Then there was the openly right deviation, led by Bukh arin, Rykov and Tomsky. The rights were alarmed at the rapid speed of in- dustrialization; they were frightened at the sharp class struggle against the kulaks; they feared the workers would not stand the strain of carrying out the Five-Year Plan; they believed it impossible to raise the gigantic amounts of necessary capital in the face of the world capit alist financial blockade against the Soviet Union; they scoffed at the pros- pect of building the Stat e farms and collectives. As a result of their wrong analysis, they wanted to make concessions to the kulaks and to slow down the fast tempo of industr ialization. This, like Trotzky's plans, would have been a fatal error. It would have strengthened the capitalist elements in the U.S.S.R. and disastrously checked the growth of Socialism. The capitalist world wa s filled with great hope by the development of these deviations, which were the subject of wide discu ssion in the Russian Com- munist party from 1926-29. Surely now, it was said, the Party will be split and the Soviet govern- "},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"THE RISE OF SOCIALISM 127 ment disastrously weakened, if not overthrown. But again their hopes cam e to naught. Under the leadership of the Central Committee so ably headed by Stalin, the Party ma sses, supported by the working class generally, rejected and completely crushed first Trotzkyism and then the openly right deviation. Trotzky later developed a definitely counter-revolutionary position; he is now capital- ism's chief maligner and slanderer of the Soviet Union, the whole bourgeoi s press being open and willing to pay for his attacks upon the Party and the U.S.S.R. Life has fully justified the position of the Party in these historic controvers ies. The final answer to both the \"left\" and right de viations is the tremen- dous success of the Five-Year Plan, with its gigantic growth of Social ist industry and collectiv- ized farming, burning ent husiasm of the workers, rising living standards of the toiling masses, the winning of the middle peasan ts for Socialism, the practical liquidation of the kulaks and nepmen, the great perspectives opened up by the second Five-Year Plan, the grow ing world pr estige and revolutionizing effect of the Soviet Union upon the enslaved masses in all countries, and, in conse- quence of all this, the greatest degree of unity that the Russian Communist party has ever known. The building of Socialis m in the Soviet Union still confronts many great problems. And the Socialist system there wi ll continue to face grave "},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"128 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA dangers and difficulties until the world power of the bourgeoisie is broken by the world's workers. But its inner problems are those of a successful, growing new social order. Socialism in the U.S. S.R. has definitely prov ed its soundness. At the XVI Party Congress Stalin thus put the question: \"When we speak of our difficul ties, we have in view not decline and not stagnation in our development, but the growth of our forces, the surging upwards of our forces, the forward march, of our economy. How many points to advance by a given date, by what percentage to in- crease our output, how many more million hectares to sow, how many months earlier than the plan to build a works, a factory, a railway — our difficulties, in contra- distinction to the difficulties of, say, America or Britain, are difficulties of growth, difficulties of progress.\" Socialism and Communism T HE FINAL aim of the Communist International is to overthrow world capitalism and replace it by world Communism, \"the basis for which has been laid by the whole course of historical development.\" On this the Program of the Communist Interna- tional says: \"Communist society will abolish the class division of society, i.e., simultaneously with the anarchy in produc- tion, it will abolish all forces of exploitation and oppres- sion of man by man. Society will no longer consist of antagonistic classes in conflict with each other, but will represent a united commonwealth of labor. For the first "},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"THE RISE OF SOCIALISM 129 time in its history mankind will take its fate into its own hands. Instead of destroying innumerable human lives and incalculable wealth in struggles between classes and nations, mankind will devote all its energies to the strug- gle against the forces of nature, to the development and strengthening of its own collective might.\" The future Communist soci ety will be Stateless. With private property in industry and land abol- ished (but, of course, not in articles of personal use), with exploitation of th e toilers ended, and with the capitalist class finally defeated and all classes liquidated, there will then be no further need for the State, which in its esse nce, is an or gan of class repression. The revolutiona ry State of the period of transition from capitali sm to Communism, the dictatorship of the proletar iat, will, in the words of Engels, \"wither away\" and be replaced by a scien- tific technical \"administr ation of things.\" The present planning boards in the Soviet Union are forerunners of such a Stateless society. Under Communism the gui ding principle will be: \"From each according to hi s ability, to each accord- ing to his needs.\" That is , the distribution of life necessities — food, clothing, shelter, education, etc. — will be free, without let or hindrance. Commu- nist production, carried ou t upon the most efficient basis and freed from the dr ains of capitalist ex- ploiters, will provide such an abundance of neces- sary commodities that ther e will be plen ty for all with a minimum of effort. There w ill then be no "},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"130 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA need for pinch-penny m easuring and weighing. Proletarian discipline and solidarity will be quite sufficient to prevent po ssible idlers from taking advantage of this free regime of distribution by either refusing to work or by unsocial wasting. The Communist system will bring the greatest advance in culture and general well-being of the masses in the history of the human race. The present progress in the S oviet Union in this re- spect is only a bare i ndication of the tremendous developments to come. Industry, freed from capi- talist anarchy and exploita tion, will develop a high efficiency and lay the ba sis for genuine mass pros- perity. Culture, emanci pated from bourgeois class ends, will become th e property of the masses and pass to new and higher levels. The road to this social development can only be opened by revolution. This is because the question of power is involved. The capitalist class, like an insatiable blood-sucker, hangs to the body of the toiling masses a nd can be dislodged only by force. But when the wo rkers have conquered power, how- ever, then the way is cl ear for an orderly de- velopment of society by a process of evolution. Naturally, even after cap italism has been over- thrown and the power taken by the workers, society cannot simply leap to a complete Communist sys- tem. There are stages of development to be gone through. The first of thes e is the transition period from the overthrow of cap italism to the establish- "},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"THE RISE OF SOCIALISM 131 ment of Socialism; then there is the period of Socialism, which is the first phase of Communism. The complete realization of Socialism and Com- munism in any country implies the defeat of the world bourgeoisie. The Soviet Union has been passing through the transition period from the overthrow of capitalism to the establishment of Socialism. It has been laying the economic and social foundations of Socialism by the building of a great system of socialized industry and agriculture, by raising the living and cultural standard s of the toiling masses, by decisively defeating the nepmen and kulaks, remnants of the old expl oiting classes. The foun- dations of the Socialis t economy are being com- pleted with the carryi ng out of the Five-Year Plan. Capitalism has been decisively defeated in the Soviet Union. Molotov says: \"The funda- mental Leninist question 'who will beat whom' has been decided against capit alism and in favor of Socialism.\" The second Five-Year Plan carries the Soviet Union definitely into the period of Socialism; the resolution of the XVII c onference of the Com- munist party of the Soviet Union says: \"The funda- mental political task of the second Five-Year Plan is the final liquidation of the capitalist class and of classes in general, the complete removal of the causes which produce class differences and exploi- tation, the overco ming of the remn ants of capital- "},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"132 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA ism in economy and in the minds of the people, the conversion of the whole of the working population of the country into conscious and active builders of the classless Socialist society.\" But, says Molo- tov, the stage of Socialism, \"will not by a long way be ended in the second five-year period.\" On the general characteristics of the Socialist stage of development a nd its relation to Com- munism, the Program of the Communist Inter- national says: \"This higher stage of Communism, the stage in which Communist society has already developed on its own foundations, in which an enorm ous growth of social pro- ductive forces has accompanied the manifold development of man — pre-supposes, as an historical condition prece- dent, a lower stage of development, the stage of Socialism. At this lower stage Communist society only just emerges from capitalist society and bears all the economic, ethical and intellectual birthmarks it has inherited from the society from whose womb it is just emerging. The pro- ductive forces of Socialism are not yet sufficiently de- veloped to assure a distribution of products of labor according to needs; these ar e distributed according to the amount of labor expended. Division of labor, i.e., the system whereby certain gr oups perform certain labor functions, and especially the distinction between mental and manual labor, still exists. Although classes are abolished, traces of the old cl ass divisions of society, and, consequently, remnants of the proletarian State power, coercion, laws, still exist. Consequently, certain traces of inequality which have not yet managed to die out altogether, still remain. The antagonism between town "},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"THE RISE OF SOCIALISM 133 and country has not yet been entirely removed. But none of these survivals of former society is protected or de- fended by any social force. Being the product of a definite level of productive forces, they will disappear as rapidly as mankind, freed fr om the fetters of the capi- talist system, subjugates the forces of nature, re- educates itself in the spirit of Communism, and passes from Socialism to complete Communism.\" The Dictatorship of the Proletariat T HE PROLETARIAN revolution marks the birth of real democracy. For the firs t time the toiling masses become free. Under cha ttel slavery, feudalism and capitalism they were oppressed and enslaved, merely the forms of this slavery changing with the varying modes of exploita tion. All the capitalist \"democracies,\" the Unite d States included, are only the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, masked with hypocritical democra tic pretenses. But the proletarian revolution, by doing away with private ownership of the social means of production and distribution and by abolishi ng the exploitation of the toilers, destroys the very foundations of en- slavement and lays the gr oundwork for the estab- lishment of a true democr acy in which there are neither oppressors nor oppressed. The first form of the new toilers' democracy after the overthrow of capit alism is the dictatorship of the proletariat. Of this type of State Marx "},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"134 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA said, with wonderful pene tration, over two genera- tions ago: \"Between capitalist and Communi st society there lies a period of revolutionary transformation from the former to the latter. A stage of pol itical transition corresponds to this period, and the State during this period can be no other than the revolutionary dictatorship of the pro- letariat.\" The dictatorship of the proletariat, unlike the capitalist dictatorship, ma kes no pretenses of heing an all-class democracy, a democracy of both ex- ploiters and exploited. It is frankly a democracy of the toiling masses, directed against the ex- ploiters. Its freedom is only for useful producers, not for social parasites. Lenin, writing before the Russian revolution, says: \"Together with an im- mense expansion of democr acy — for the first time becoming democracy of th e poor, democracy of the people and not democracy of the rich folk — the dictatorship of the prolet ariat will produce a whole series of restrictions of liberty in the case of the oppressors, exploiters and capitalists.\" 17 The dictatorship of the pr oletariat, or the Work- ers' and Farmers' governme nt, is a kind of State. Lenin thus define s a State: \"The State is a par- ticular form of organization of force; it is the or- ganization of violence for the holding down of some class.\" Thus the capitalis t State, strong right arm of the bourgeoisie, has as its basic function, the 17 The State and Revolution, p. 90."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"THE RISE OF SOCIALISM 135 holding by force of the working class under capi- talist exploitation. But, Lenin goes on to ex- plain: \"What is the class which the proletariat must hold down? It can only be, naturally, the exploit- ing class, i.e., the bourg eoisie.\" The fundamental difference between the capi talist State and the dic- tatorship of the proletaria t, however, is that the former is the rule of a small, exploiting minority, and it perpetuates this rule by force and dema- gogy; while the latter is the rule of the great toil- ing majority and it di rects its power towards abolishing every form of exploitation and the liquidation of the exploiting classes. The Pro- gram of the Communist International says: \"The dictatorship of the pr oletariat is a continuation of the class struggle under new conditions. The dicta- torship of the proletariat is a stubborn fight — bloody and bloodless, violent and peacef ul, military and economic, pedagogical and administrative — against the remnants of the exploiting classes within the country, against the upshoots of the new bourgeoisie that spring up on the basis of the still prevailing commodity production.\" To establish the dictator ship of the proletariat it is not merely a questi on of making over the de- feated capitalist government. Engels states in his 1888 preface to the Communist Manifesto: \"One thing especially was prove d by the (Paris) Com- mune, viz., that the worki ng class cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made State machinery and wield it for its own purposes.\" The capitalist State "},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"136 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA must be broken down and the Workers' State built from the ground up on enti rely different princi- ples, and this was done in the U.S.S.R. In doing so it has been necessary to set up a powerful Red Army and the well-known O.G.P.U. to defend the revolution against the capitalist attacks from within and without. The dictatorship of the proletariat is the demo- cratic rule of the toiling masses, with the working class in the lead, develo ping the revolutionary program and forming the co re of the revolutionary organization. The Program of the Communist In- ternational says: \"The dictatorship of the proletariat implies that the industrial workers alone are cap able of leading the entire mass of the toilers. On the other hand, while represent- ing the dictatorship of a single class, the dictatorship of the proletariat at the same time represents a special form of class alliance between the proletariat, as the vanguard of the toiling masses, and th e numerous non-proletarian sections of the toiling masses, or the majority of them. It represents an alliance for the complete overthrow of capital, for the complete suppression of the opposition of the bourgeoisie and its attempts at restoration, an alliance aiming at the complete building up and consoli- dation of Socialism.\" Only when the cap italist class is decisively beaten on a national and internati onal scale and class lines finally broken down will th e workers' need for a State die out and the pr oletarian dictatorship \"wither away.\" Under the classless, Stateless "},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"THE RISE OF SOCIALISM 137 regime of Communism there will exist a broad and genuine freedom such as the world heretofore has not even remotely approached. Lenin says in his The State and Revolution, p. 91: \"Only then will be possible and will be realized a really full democracy, a democracy without any exceptions. And only then will democracy itself begin to wither away in virtue of the simple fact that, freed from capitalist slavery, from the innumerable horrors, savagery, absurdi- ties, and infamies of capitalis t exploitation, people will gradually become accustomed to the observance of the elementary rules of social life, known for centuries, re- peated for thousands of years in all sermons. They will become accustomed to their observance without force, without constraint, without subjection, without the spe- cial apparatus for compulsion which is called the State.\" The government of the Soviet Union is a dicta- torship of the proletariat, or rule of the workers. For the toiling masses of factory and farm it es- tablishes a genuine democr acy, a democracy totally different from and incomparably in advance of the so-called democracy of the capitalist countries. But, as we have remarked , this democracy does not extend to the exploiting classes, or rather what is left of them. The Soviet government, as a Work- ers' State, is liquidating these classes and the whole system of robbery upon whic h their rule was based. The economic and political power of the big capi- talists and landlords has b een completely shattered and they no longer exist as a class; now the kulaks (rich farmers) and nepmen (petty trad ers) are "},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"138 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA going the same way into soci al oblivion as classes. All this has not been accomplished without the sharpest struggle which, in its early stages, amounted to civil war. But the current blood- curdling stories of violence and persecution are gross fabrications , circulated by capitalist agents to discredit the Soviet Union in the eyes of the world's toilers. Citizenship in the Sovi et democracy is based upon work, only those doi ng useful labor being allowed to vote. The para sitic remnants , such as ex-nobles, Czarist officers, landlor ds, capitalists, clericals, etc., are disfranchised. There are no qualifications of sex, nati onality, residence, etc.; whoever works can vote. The Soviets are made up of representa tives coming dire ctly from the toiling masses, from the fa ctories and the villages. Not wealth, as in all the capitalist countries, but actual service to society, is the foundation of citi- zenship in the U.S.S.R. Not only in politics do the toiling masses exer- cise their democracy, but also in every field of social organization and ac tivity. The trade unions, based upon factory committe es, establish an indus- trial democracy completely without parallel in any other part of the world. Even in the realms of art and science and literature, the influence, direct and indirect, of the worki ng masses in the factories and fields is felt. For example, the formula- tion of the second Five-Y ear Plan is being made "},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"THE RISE OF SOCIALISM 139 on the basis of the broadest mass discussion. Duranty says, (New York Times, Mar. 5, 1932) : \"Every stage of the work is subjected to full dis- cussion by worker s, party members, executives and government officials.\" In no country in the world do the toilers enjoy such free speech, right of or- ganization and general partic ipation in every social institution as in the Soviet Uni on. Tales about the personal dictatorship of Stalin, about \"forced labor,\" about the suppression of the freedom of the masses, are, like the earlier stories about the \"nationalization of women,\" etc., plain lies. Charges by enemies that th e Soviet system is an oppressive autocracy conflict fatally with their other charges that there is so much democracy in industry that it interf eres with efficiency. Lenin says: \"The Soviet democracy consists of workers organized so inform ally that for the first time the people as a whole are learning to gov- ern.\" 18 To carry out their democratic activities in all social fields, the Russian workers and peas- ants have built up the most gigantic ma ss organiza- tions in human history. These stretch over all phases of the economic, po litical and social life, and are of decisive influence. Among the more impor- tant of them are the Communist organizations proper (the Party, the Youth and the Pioneers) with about 15,000,000 memb ers all told , the trade unions with 17,000,000, and the consumers' co- 18 The Soviets at Work."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"140 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA operatives with 70,000,0 00. Besides, there are many more vast organizations for culture, defense, sport, aviation, etc., containing scores of millions of members. The Soviet electorate, numbering 85,000,000 voters, is by far th e largest in the world. These tremendous mass orga nizations of toilers, entirely without comparison in capitalist countries, are the very bac kbone of the whole Soviet system. They are all growing very rapidly, an example being the Party, which has increased seven-fold, from 440,000 members to 2, 800,000, since the death of Lenin. While the workers in all capitalist c ountries face ever-increasing tendencie s towards Fascism and the denial of their most elementary rights, in the Soviet Union the workers and peasants are build- ing a great new freedom . In the comparison, fatal to the world capitalis t system, of the decaying capitalism as against the risi ng Socialism, this fact has a vital significance th at the oppressed toilers of the world will not fail to understand. It is one of the revolutionary nails th at are being driven into the coffin of mo ribund capitalism. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union T HE LEADER and organizer of th e proletarian dic- tatorship is the Communist party. In a Socialist society, based upon the wo rkers and farmers and where the aim of the government is to advance "},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"THE RISE OF SOCIALISM 141 solely the interests of these toiling masses, there is room for only one Party, the Communist Party. Of course, in the capitalist countries the Socialists and other defenders of the pseudo-democracy of capitalism protest agains t this situation and de- mand the right of political organization for the remnants of the old exploiting classes. But what stupidity it would be for the victorious workers, whose aim it is to liquidat e all classes, to permit these counter-revolutionary elements to organize themselves into political parties and thus enable them to sahotage the new re gime, to fight for the re- establishment of their syst em of robbing the work- ers and generally to act as a barrier to the progress of the new society. It is a capitalist lie th at pictures the Russian Communist party as a sort of clique ruling over the masses. On the cont rary, the doors of the Party, although they are closed against the rem- nants of the former ruli ng classes, are wide open to all earnest workers a nd poor farmers who accept its full program and are willing to perform the hard tasks which it demands of its members. A great mass organization itself and growing by leaps and bounds, the Communist party gives all possible stimulation to the other vast mass organiza- tions which, under its ge neral leadership, are the foundations of the prol etarian democracy. The toiling masses of the Sovi et Union know that the Communist party is thei r great leader and they "},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"142 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA give it their enthusias tic support. They have learned from long years of the bitter est struggle any people has ever passe d through that the Party of Lenin is the only Pa rty of the revolution. The Russian Communist party is unique in function and structure. As the Party of the toil- ers it has the responsibility of facing and solving every major problem of the revolution. It is the Communist party that work s out the basic line of action in all spheres of the economic and political life. As the crystallization of the most class con- scious elements of the to iling masses, it gives the revolutionary lead in ev ery direction. For this purpose its structure is es pecially adapted, being based upon nuclei (units) in the shops, villages, army, trade unions, coope ratives, schools, Soviets and every other institution. It is thus part of the very flesh and bone of the toilers everywhere. Without a doubt, th e Russian Communist party, with its manifold tasks and roots deep into the masses, is by far the most complicated and highest type of organization ev er developed by mankind in all its history. The Communist party is the brain and heart and nerves of the Russian revolution, and so it must be in any proletarian re volution. It makes the most severe demands upon its membership. They must be models of prolet arian courage, initiative, energy and resourcefulness . They are the leaven that lightens the whole lump.

In the dark period of the great hunger and famine it was the Communists who set the example of self-denial and encouragement for the masses. And now, in the building of Socialism, it is they, who, in the face of incredible obstacles, are carrying through the gr eat Five-Year Plan to success, to the amazement of the whole capitalist world. In every crisis it is the Communists who fling themselves into th e breach; for every great problem it is they who co me forward with the solu- tion and militantly apply it. That is why the Party of Lenin stands unc hallenged as the leader of the masses in the Soviet Union. The Communist party of the U.S.S.R. is based upon the principles of demo cratic centralism, de- veloped by Lenin. That is , first the decision is democratically arrived at by the widest mass dis- cussion and then, the disc ussion closed, the policy is executed with strong di scipline and the mobiliza- tion of all possible forces. This is an irresistible combination. The mass disc ussion lays the basis not only for a correct decisi on but also for the dis- cipline necessary to carry it through effectively. The Communist party of the Soviet Union is in- comparably more democratic than the Socialist parties, the A. F. of L. and other conservative trade unions of the worl d. These organizations, with their hard bureaucratic ruling cliques and their contempt for the ma sses, are true expressions "},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"144 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA of the autocratic capitali st system of which they are such loyal defenders. The Communist party is the bearer of the first real democracy in the mod- ern world. A recent example of th e workings of Com- munist democratic centra lism was seen in con- nection with the struggle against Trotzkyism and the right deviation. Thes e issues were the sub- jects of the broadest mass discussions, no other country or organization in the world has seen the like. Not only the Party membership but millions of other workers were i nvolved. The results were briefly: a fundamental and mass analysis of every angle of the industriali zation and other problems confronting the U.S.S.R.; the crystallization of a clear policy, backed by a solid mass opinion united and clarified in the great discussion; the over- whelming defeat of Trot zky and Bukharin, both ideologically and by the al most unanimous vote of the workers; the achieveme nt of an unparalleled unification of the Party; and finally, the building up of a militant and intell igent mass discipline and mobilization of forc es which is the basis of the ter- rific pace in carrying thro ugh the Five-Year Plan. Democratic centralism, th e expression of the fun- damental democracy of th e workers and their natu- ral discipline, bodes ill for the capitalist system.

The Soviet Union, the crystall ization of the Communist program in life, and the s hock-brigade of the world proletariat, rising and flourishing with its great revolutionary strength in the midst of a decaying, declining capitalist system, is the hope and guar- antee of a new life for the starved and exploited of the earth.

Ignoring the fact that converting Capitalists into Fascists was his idea, Foster would have us know that they can't expect to get away with it. Says he, \"Fascism is not an alternative to capitalism; it is capitalism, the most extreme expression of the capitalist dictatorship.\" Having populated the American countryside to his satisfaction with sheeted bearers of rope, faggot, knout and moneybags, Foster announces solemnly that Fas- cism cannot \"... save the present decaying social sys- tem.\" There, for once, Foster is right. Fascism is too corrupt to save any system, including its own. Comrade Foster proceeds to state that Fascism \". . . cannot liquidate the class struggle; it cannot permanently hold down the workers and poor farmers by force. Faced by constant ly worsening conditions and mass starvation, these masses will, under the leadership of the Communist party, eventually break through every system of Fascist terrorism and establish a Soviet re- gime\" in the United States. Man the barricades. Toward Soviet America! But when William Z. Foster trumpets for the rising of the proletariat, what kind of revolution is he seeking to incite? Marx saw success in terms of swift and decisive vio- lence, the result of a widespread mass uprising. After that, he preached, the turnabout would have been ac- "},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"NOTES ON CHAPTER 3 3-D complished; Communism, by whatever name, would be in the saddle and all would he right with the world. But Lenin, revi§ing almost everything Marx handed down to him, even rewrote the revolution. Both men believed in overthrow. Both believed in force anil violence. It was in their ideas of what was to happen afterward that Lenin differed from Karl Marx. The German dreamer had conjured up a sort of and- they-all-lived-happily-ever-after picture of life under the triumphant Red banner. Lenin, much more practical, understood that the principals in such a far-reaching upheaval — those who had siezed power and those who had lost it — were not simply going to kiss and make up. The struggle would go on for a long time, until every vestige of the old order had been elimi- nated. The pragmatic little Lenin therefore asked him- self how best the victors might achieve complete and permanent control. The answer was the answer that has come to every despot in history: Get rid of the opposition. Some conquerors, a little less vicious than most, have tried to solve their pr oblem by a process of amal- gamation, by absorption, by mass repopulation, by dispersion. Beyond such relatively humane aproaches there is always the standard remedy: murder. Herod applied it to Israelites; Sa racens to Christians; Hitler to Jews; Soviet Communists to kulaks. Red Chinese are annihilating non-Red Chines e. Fidel Castro is elim- inating political opponents of his own language and blood. To Nikolai Lenin, the \"opposition\" was not com- puted merely in terms of humankind. There were also such stumbling-blocks as \"social forces\", \"habits\", ways of life. The dictatorship of the proletariat would have to grind them into the dust. "},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"3-E NOTES ON CHAPTER 3 To Marx, the revolution wa s simply \"the revolu- tion\". Lenin's more far-seei ng concept ha§ been labeled the \"protracted struggle\". Karl Marx thought Communism had but one enemy: Capitalism. He wanted its abolition, down through the upper half of the bourgeoisie. He was willing to leave the small tradesmen, the white-collar workers, and other lesser elements of the system more or less undisturbed. It was his theory that these survivors soon would sub- side into the commonality. Lenin knew better. Accordingly, there came a time when he extended the proscription list — those to be purged after the takeover — to the lesser bourgeoisie as well. Whoever could be called a \"producer\", even a \"small producer\", must go. And Lenin admitted that his definition actually covered such \"small producers\" as peasants! \", . . The abolition of classes not only means driving out the landlords and capitalists,\" he decreed, \". . . it means abolishing the small commodity-producers. . . . They encircle the proletariat on every side with a petty- bourgeois atmosphere. . . .\" (the italics are Lenin's). So — clear the atmosphere by doing away with the small-commodity producers! Even the least of the bourgeoisie must be exterminated. There must, in fact, be no bourgeoisie at all. The sole element of the population permitted to go on existing, under the Leninist system, is the working man. More specifically, the working man in industry. Whether in mine, mill, or factory, he is Lenin's true proletarian. Obviously, the dictatorship of the proletariat is to be a sharply segregated affair, if none but the industrial rank and file may share the crown.

Until that dread and distant date, all that lies ahead in Lenin's world of toilers — a world of which Lenin's successors continue to dream — is an iron-fisted au- tocracy intended to go on practically forever. The State will not exist for the good of all its people, but only for the good of a privileged portion of its people — the \"proletariat\". Where Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels thundered, \". . . Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communist revolution,\" the renegade Capitalist, Engels, in October 1872 brought it down to specifics: \". . . A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets, and cannon — authoritarian means . . .; and if the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the reaction- aries.\" In TOWARD SOVIET AMERIC A, William Z. Foster echoed them all: Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin. We are offered something of each: the blood and thunder of Karl Marx, the authoritarianism and bayonets of Engels, the \"protracted struggle\" of Lenin, mass murder by Josef Stalin. Whole classes are exterminated. And, as Foster does not hesitate to inform us, all of these approaches are to be applied to the United States when the planned violence erupts here."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3 CAPITALIST ATTEMPTS TO LIQUIDATE THE CRISIS I N CHAPTER I we have seen that the capitalists all over the world try to find a way out of the crisis for themselves by thro wing the burden of the crisis upon the workers a nd poor farmers through wage-cuts, reducti ons in social insurance, speed-up in industry, leng thening of worki ng hours, tax laws directed against the producer s, inflation of the cur- rency, etc., by intens ifying their competition against each other through tariffs, dumping, rate wars, etc., and by preparing to deluge the world with a new blood-bath of war. This is the main line of capitalist policy. Be- sides, and in connection with it, the capitalists have developed a whole series of additional \"remedies\" to cure the economic weakne sses of capitalism and to shield the capitalists fro m their effects. It is with these measures especi ally that we shall now deal. They have to do with both of the major contradictions of capita lism; the economic gap be- tween the producing and c onsuming powers of the masses, and the class conf lict between the capital- 146"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"ATTEMPTS TO LIQUIDATE CRISIS 147 ists and the exploited mass es of workers and farm- ers. First let us deal with those of an economic character. The Rationalization of Industry I N THE years following the World War the capi- talist countries, under stress of the growing eco- nomic crisis, developed a world-wide movement for the rationalization of indu stry. In this the United States took the lead. Mass production, the speed- up in industry, became the cure-all for capitalism. Ford was worshipped as the patron saint of the capitalists everywhere. Am erican speed-up meth- ods spread themselves throughout the capitalist world. The League of Na tions officially supported rationalization. True to their role as \"agents of the bour- geoisie,\" the Socialist par ties in the various coun- tries took up th e program of the rationalization of industry and made a fetish of it. They even be- came more enthusiastic th an the capitalists them- selves. They put it forward to the masses not only as the way to capitalist prosperity, but also the golden road to the gradual establishment of So- cialism. The British Labor Party and trade unions became a tail to th e speed-up plans of Mond and other industrialists, endorsing the League of Nations' rationalization pr ogram, the first pro- vision of which is \"to secure the maximum efficiency of labor with the minimum of effort.\" The Ger- "},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"148 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA man Social Democracy wa s no whit behind, its unions declaring that: \"I n full agreement with the memorandum of the German industrialists, we con- sider that rationalizatio n is the most important condition for the well-being of the nation.\" The Socialist party of the Unit ed States, including the Muste \"left\" group, grew no less enthusiastic over this bosses' plan to still more sharply exploit the workers. The leaders of the American Federation of Labor, of course, fell into step with the bosses for the rationalization of in dustry. Their main pol- icy, variously expressed as the B. & O. Plan, the \"higher strategy of labor,\" and the \"new wage pol- icy,\" was collaboration with the bosses to increase production. Industrial efficiency became the tin god of trade unionism. Win. Green said, Ameri- can Federationist, (Jan., 19 28) : \"The Union is the workers' business agency for industrial efficiency.\" The trade union leaders made a strong plea to the capitalists to le t them organize their workers for joint exploitation. They declared that the labor movement had come to maturity; the class struggle was over; class consciousness was out-of-date; now nothing remained to do but cooperate with the capitalists for the indust rial speed-up, which would automatically benefit everybody. They hired ef- ficiency engineers for the unions and set out arm- in-arm with the employers to drive the workers ever faster in industry. "},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"ATTEMPTS TO LIQUI DATE CRISIS 149 But now the whole rati onalization of industry movement is ideologica lly bankrupt. While the bosses, of course, seek to increase the speed-up in the plants that are operatin g, it is patent for all who have eyes to see that it offers no solution for the crisis. The entire rationalization of industry philosophy was based upon the illusion that capi- talist markets automatically extend themselves to absorb capitalist producti on. But in reality the rationalization movement , by hugely developing the productivity of labor while the consuming power of the masses lagged far behind, greatly sharpened the major contradiction between capi- talist production and mark ets, and it was one of the main factors in brin ging about the present world-wide economic collapse. That which was to save capitalism just about ruined it. The American \"New Capitalism\" T HE NATIONALIZATION movement reached its high- est pitch in the United States. Here it was based on the principles of mass production and \"high\" wages, \"protection\" and in flation of the home mar- ket by sky-high tariffs and installment buying, and a militant imperialistic dr ive all over the world to conquer markets for capital and other commodi- ties. This was the so-called new capitalism. This \"new capitalism\" was hailed as ushering in a new era. Its proponen ts declared that it pro- "},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"150 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA vided the way to liquidate the conflict between capitalist production and exchange, and that, con- sequently, it had solved the tormenting cyclical crisis. The \"new capitalis m\" was to abolish pov- erty, to do away with th e class struggle and to open up an endless perspect ive of industrial devel- opment. Its champions bo astfully shouted that Ford had hopelessly beaten Marx and that there never could be a revolution in the United States. And all the capitalist worl d, harassed by the ever- encroaching general crisis , looked to the American capitalist h eaven with wonder and hope, patterning after it as best they co uld. The Social Fascists of the world hailed the movement as the savior of capitalism. Even in the ranks of the American Communist party the theory found expression; Lovestone, later expelled, developing the notion that American capitalism provided an exception to the general laws of capitalism. But what a sad awakeni ng was in store. The American capitalist dream has turned into a dread- ful nightmare. The terri ble economic crisis is upon us again and with mo re devastating effects than ever before. It is exactly in the United States where the drop in production has been most catastrophic, wher e the army of the unemployed is the largest. Mass produc tion has flooded the lim- ited markets with a tidal wave of unsaleable com- modities; \"high\" wages ha ve turned out to be a tragic joke in the face of the gigantic unemploy- "},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"ATTEMPTS TO LIQUI DATE CRISIS 151 ment and wholesale wage-cuts. The \"new capi- talism\" has proved itself to be very much a part of the old capitalism of the rest of the world. The savior very badly needs saving. And the purse- proud American businessm an is humiliated in the eyes of the whole capitalist world. Indeed, his erstwhile admirer, Mussolini, was unkind enough recently even to blame th e world economic crisis upon exactly the boasted American mass produc- tion. After all, Marxis m has triumphed over Fordism. In the \"new ca pitalism\" the thing counted upon to cure the basic economic weakness of capitalism was \"high\" wages. Its a dvocates, with Ford at their head, had a glimmering of the menacing con- tradiction between the producing and consuming powers of the masses, of the folly of going ahead developing production on the simple theory of unlimited markets. In word s at least they recog- nized the necessity of in creasing the low purchas- ing power of the masses. Their whole conception was best developed by Foster and Catchings in their books, Business W ithout a Buyer and The Road to Plenty. They ar gued, with their theory of \"financing the buyer, \" that economic crises could be averted if, at the first sign of such, the declining purchasing power of the masses was promptly bolstered up by the initiation of broad building programs. Pres ident Hoover, as is known, was an advocat e of this theory. "},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"152 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA But it was all a sham and a delusion. The so- called \"financing of the buyer\" never took place under the \"new ca pitalism,\" nor could it. To sup- pose otherwise is to assume the possibility of the capitalists progressively gi ving up their profits. The alleged high wages du ring the heyday of this theory were confined almost entirely to the skilled workers. The gains to the buying power of the masses in this respect were more than offset by the accompanying huge incr eases in industrial and agricultural productivity. The whole thing was only an elaborate method of intensified rational- ization of industry. The exploitation of the work- ers was increased, not diminished. The mass of surplus value taken by the employers was relatively and actually greater, not less. The basic economic effect was to still furt her widen the gap between the producing and consuming powers of the masses. This deepening of the economic contra- diction is graphically illus trated by the following figures, taken fro m Tugwell's Indus try's Coming of Age and the 1927 U. S. Census of Manufac- tures : Wages paid Value added by manufacture 1914—$ 4,009,000,000 $ 9,224,000,000 1923— 11,000,000,000 25,832,000,000 1927— 10,800,000,000 27,500,000,000 During the Coolidge period American capitalism was able to make a great show of prosperity, not because it had overcome the major economic "},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"ATTEMPTS TO LIQUI DATE CRISIS 153 contradiction of capital ism, but because of a whole series of temporaril y advantageous factors. Among these were the huge loans to war-stricken Europe, which translated themselves largely into exports of manufactured goods; the easy conquest of world markets by powerful American imperial- ism, unscathed by the wa r, in the face of the broken-down European comp etitors; the growth of the automobile industry; the development of in- stallment buying, which for a time artificially stimulated th e market, etc. But these erstwhile favor able factors have now radically altered. The au tomobile industry has become more than saturate d; the installment sys- tem has exploded; exports have fallen off, with the European capitalist pow ers constantly meeting the United States with a sharper competition, etc. Hence, the inner contradi ctions of American im- perialism are able to mani fest themselves with full force and they are doing so with a vengeance. When Hoover blames Eur ope and the war for the crisis he is only a shallo w apologist for capitalism. The fact is that Ameri can capitalism, like world capitalism in general, is rotten at the heart. The present great economic worl d crisis began in the United States. The crisis has shown conclu sively just how feeble and artificial was the Amer ican plan of \"financing the buyer.\" At the outset of the crisis President Hoover made many spectacular gestures in line "},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"154 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA with this theory. He cal led national conferences of industrialists, bankers, and \"labor leaders.\" Then he filled the country with rosy prophecies that the crisis would be promptly liquidated by the gigantic building, no-wag e-cut progra m outlined by his conferences. But the whole thing turn ed out an inglorious fizzle. The \"fin ancing of the buy er\" degenerated into an attempt by Hoover to exorcize the crisis by pollyanna prosperity ballyhoo. The \"great\" construction program developed into the biggest sag the building industry has ever known. Even the government building program failed to mate- rialize, the New York Am erican, (Mar. 16, 1932), stating, \"The total expend ed on public works (na- tional, state, local) was actually less in 1931 than in 1929.\" And as for k eeping up wage scales, hardly were the Hoover conferences concluded than the wage-cuts began, and since then sweeping slashes have taken place in the railroad, mining, steel, textile and many other industries. The Grand Lama of the \"high\" wage theory, Ford himself, has also put th rough general wage-cuts. Likewise, the government, locally and nationally, is reducing wages in every direction. But the most graphic repudiation of the scheme of \"financing the buyer\" is to be found in the starvation unemployment relief system of the Hoover government. The throwing of 12,000,- 000 workers into unemployment gave the market "},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"ATTEMPTS TO LIQUI DATE CRISIS 155 an awful jolt beca use of the reduction in the gen- eral purchasing power of the masses. Here was a good chance to \"finance the buyer\" by giving the unemployed a system of government insur- ance. But instead they have been given only the most miserable charity dole. To do otherwise would touch the sacred profits of the bosses. The only elements to which the Hoover government has extended assistance in the crisis are the banks, the railroads, the big taxpayers. Thus the fire of the ec onomic crisis exposes the fact that the results of the \"new capitalism\" are the same basically as those of capitalist imperialism generally, only more ruthless and devastating. The American capitalist cl ass is as deep in the mud as its European riva ls are in the mire, and like them, it throws the burd ens of the crisis upon the working class, it ra tionalizes its industries, enters more desperately th an ever into the struggle for international markets, and takes the world lead in preparing war as a wa y out of the crisis. The \"new capitalism\" has not cured the contradictions of capitalism, but has enor mously sharpened them. Trusts and Cartels I N HIS work, Imperialism, (p. 12), Lenin says, \"Half a century ago when Marx wrote Capital free competition was consid ered by the majority of economists as one of Natu re's laws.\" But the "},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"156 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA development of imperialis m and the inte nsification of competition on every front has ended such no- tions. Now capitalism everywhere strives to eliminate competition a nd to establish monopoly. Thus the maze of trusts and cartels on a local, national and internationa l scale. The aims of these monopolistic organizations is to screw up prices, to cut labor costs, to control markets, etc. One of their major objectiv es is to restrict pro- duction, to cramp the e xpansive productive forces within the confines of the narrow markets. To this end every reactionar y practice has been used, from suppression of important inventions to whole- sale destruction of co mmodities and means of production. This is typi cal of the anti-social, parasitic character of decadent monopolistic capi- talism, to attempt to limit production for the benefit of a few idle owners in a world where the overwhelming majority of the people are lacking the necessities of life. In Solidarity, (Nov., 1931), P. Boyden gives a number of examples of such commodity destructio n, from which the fol- lowing items are culled: \"A few months ago, in Oa kland, CaL, 100,000 gallons of milk were dumped into the river. At about the same time, 40,000 salmon were dest royed in Ketchikan Bay, Alaska. In Los Angeles 120 carloads of cabbages were plowed under in the fields. Not long ago in California a Rotary Club played baseball with 60,000 eggs that were destroyed to keep them out of the market. And it "},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"ATTEMPTS TO LIQUI DATE CRISIS 157 is the same in other parts of the world; in Brazil 2,000,000 sacks of coffee were thrown into the sea, in Australia vast herds of sheep are simply massacred to keep the price of lamb high. Corn Is poisoned so that it will be unfit for human consumption.\" 1 But trusts and cartels ha ve not proved a cure for the economic crisis, any more than has the American \"new capitalis m.\" This is true, both for capitalism as a whol e and for the respective industries. Instead of \"stabilizing\" industry, as their proponents say, thes e organizations are, on the contrary, feeding the cr isis with their policies of rationalization of industr y, mass lay-offs, wage- cuts and intensified exploitation of the workers. Even their very resistance to price declines pro- longs and intensifies the cr isis. As Stalin said in a recent speech, \"The capitalists are chopping off the branch that supports them. Instead of escap- ing the crisis, they are aggravating it, piling up new causes for a still more severe crisis.\" Consider the plight of the United States, home of the trusts. Here 24 banks hold assets worth more than those of 20,000 small banks; four great financial interests control 95 % of the total output of electrical power; the en tire railroad system is dominated by a half do zen New York banks. Yet the whole industrial-financial machine is prostrate in deepest crisis. Nor have the individual trusti- 1 Press dispatches announce that the Brazilian government has decided to burn 12,000,000 sacks of coffee and to cut down 400,- 000,000 coffee trees in the State of Sao Paulo. "},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"158 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA fled industries been able to shield themselves. The great automobile industr y, erstwhile boast of American industrialists, in which three of each four cars are constructed by either Ford or Gen- eral Motors, is working, as I write these lines, at only 20% of capacity. Or take steel, with two big corporations controlli ng 52% of the industry, operating at only 20%. Th e oil industry, home of great combinations, is likewise a picture of an- archy, over-production a nd paralysis. The other industries, whether trustif ied or not — coal, tex- tiles, chemicals, etc.— are in a similar pickle. Also the railroads, government-regulated and most highly-monopolized of all American industries, ex- perience the general econo mic crisis, with two- thirds of their workers either totally unemployed or working only part-time and with bankruptcy knocking at the doors of many companies. It is exactly in the mo st trustified countries— the United States, Germany, Great Britain, Japan — that the crisis bears down most heavily. The trusts do not escape the laws of capitalist society. They cannot ge t away from competition. They compete against the untrustified sections of their own industries; agai nst other industries (coal against oil and waterpower, railroads against auto- trucks, etc.) and against the industries of other countries. Besides, their whole position is under- mined by the crisis in backward, hopelessly com- petitive agriculture. Bu t more important than all "},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"ATTEMPTS TO LIQUI DATE CRISIS 159 this is the fact that the whole trend of the trusts is to increase the exploitati on of the workers and poor farmers and thus to render these masses still less able to buy back what they produce. The trusts unavoidably widen the fata l gap between capitalist production and distribution, the basic cause of the crisis. The cartel movement has had no better success than the trusts in chec king the economic crisis, either in general or in individual industries. The cartels have the same major objectives as the trusts, to curtail producti on, boost prices, etc., but their inner organization is more frail, even when headed by \"dictators\" lik e Will Hayes and Dud- ley Field Malone. In th e present crisis the cartels, so hopefully welc omed by capitalism gen- erally, are breaking under th e strain. It is no con- tradiction for the cap italists of the various countries to drastically rationalize their industries so that they can the more effec tively compete with each other, and at the same time set up international cartels presumably for the purpose of limiting competition and production. This is because these international cartels, in reality, are only new battle- grounds for the competitors ; the fight for markets goes on inside their limits, with the stronger groups pushing the weaker ones to the wall, forcing them to accept smaller produc tion quotas, poorer mar- kets, etc. This is clearly reflected in the experience of the"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"160 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA famous European Steel and Iron Agreement, signed in 1926. This orga nization faced not only ruinous competition from w ithout, from the steel harons of Great Britain, Poland, etc., but also from within. The New York Ti mes, (Sept. 9, 1931), says that the members of the cartel \"engaged in a free-for-all scramble fo r orders, cartel regula- tions and prices being entirely disregarded.\" It is not surprising therefore that this great cartel has collapsed. Chadbourne's in ternational sugar car- tel is fast going the same road because of the same disease. The New York Ti mes, (Mar. 19, 1932), states that the Chadbourne plan is now \"practically abandoned\" because of in curable dissensions among the sugar producers. Mr. Chadbourne attaches very great impor- tance to his cartel. He ha s declared that in this attempt to limit the worl d production of sugar and to boost prices \"the capitalist system itself is on trial.\" If so, then capitalism will surely be found guilty and sentenced to death, for the cartel movement cannot overcome the over-production that causes the capitalist crisis. On the contrary, as I. Lippincott says, the cartel \"is a great stimu- lant to further production , and it thus aggravates the problem whic h it is designed to solve.\" 2 Sum- marizing the experiences of the cartel movement, a dispatch to the Scripps-Howard papers (Mar. 3, 1931) says: \"European cartels in steel, rayon, 2 Economic Resources and Industries of the World, p. 55."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"ATTEMPTS TO LIQUI DATE CRISIS 161 cement, aluminum and coal, and international agreements in nitrates, sugar and coffee were studied by the U.

The period through which we are passing is a period like the fall of the Roman Empire, like the Re- naissance, like the beginni ng of the political and social revolution in Engl and and France; it is dif- ferent from them all, is more powerful than them all and holds the world more in its grasp than any of them.\" Mr. Butler then cries out somewhat hys- terically for \"an internatio nal plan desi gned to show that capitalism is a superi or system to Communism.\" Such clamor has resulted in a whole series of \"plans\" being devised to stabilize the anarchistic capitalist economy. The country is infested with a plague of 5- and 10-year plans, and the deepening crisis will bring more. Am ong them are the proj- ects of Swope (General Electric), U. S. Cham- ber of Commerce, Associat ed General Contractors of America, Civic Federation, A.

What these \"plans\" usua lly have in common is a demand for more active participation of the gov- ernment in the trustificati on and control of indus- try. Capitalist \"planning\" is a step still further into State capitalism. The capitalist government, as the instrument of the ruling class, always has as its main function the furtherance of capitalist industry and the increase of profits at the expense of the workers, and it more and more directly in- tervenes in industry, but never was this interven- tion so direct and far-reaching as the capitalist \"planners\" now propose. The movement for capi- talist \"planning\" is an effo rt to hasten the process of monopolization with still more vigorous aid of the government. It also te nds in the general di- rection of Fascism, It is characteristic that the Social Fascist and Fascist leaders of the Socialist party and A.F. of L., together with ma ny liberals, are advocates of capitalist \"planning.\" They try to prove that the revolution is not n ecessary for an ordered economy and prosperity for the workers. As agents of finance capitalis m, these elements always manage to find \"progress\" in every new step that the capitalists find necess ary for the exploitation of the workers. The A.F. of L. leaders' demand now for \"planning\" and the abrogation of the anti- trust laws is just as mu ch in the service of the "},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"164 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA employers as their support of the tariff, the ration- alization of industry, the present wage-cut drive, etc. But these capitalistic ec onomic \"plans\" must and do fail. They are wrecked on the same reefs as the trusts and cartels: viz., the inability of capital- ism, whether \"planned\" or not, to sell its commodi- ties in a market that lack s the wherewithal to buy them; and the hopelessly competitive character of the capitalist system. Ca pitalism \"cannot eat its cake and have it.\" \"Planned\" capitalist economy cannot bridge over the basi c economic and political contradictions of capitalism. It is as fruitless as capitalist \"efforts\" to end war. In fact, capitalist ec onomic \"plans\" are not plans at all, in the sens e of a fundamental control of the whole resources and production of society, as the Russians practice it . At most they are only a crude sort of governme nt regulation. Private ownership of industry, ex ploitation of the work- ers, production for prof it, competitive scramble for markets — all founda tion stones of capitalist economy — make totally impossible the orderly balance between production and exchange and the thorough mobilization of a ll economic forces, either by agreement or compulsion, that is f undamentally necessary for real soci al planning.

By going in fo r \"planned\" production, capital- ism would steal a leaf fro m the Soviet book, despite the frenzied denials of Matthew Woll. Stuart Chase says: \"The American problem is to 'plan' without revolution.\" But th is will not work; it is a case of the whole So viet book or nothing. Planned economy and cap italism are mutually ex- clusive. Rubenstein corr ectly declares: \"A plan is in contradiction to the very structure of capital- ism.\" 3 As Milyutin says: \"Planned economy pre- supposes the dictatorship of the proletariat, the abolition of private propert y in the means of pro- duction, the socialization of the means of produc- tion— in other words: th e victory of Socialism.\" 4 Only when the industries are socialized, when ex- ploitation has ceased, when production and the markets, freed of the pr ofit motive, automatically balance each other — that is, under Socialism — is a genuine planned economy possible. The central principle of Socialist pl anning cannot be grafted onto the alien capitalist sy stem. Socialism in the Soviet Union works with a plan, because its whole nature calls for planfuln ess and system.

All the capitalist \"planners\" enthusiastically cite the experience of the Wa r Industries Board as a glowing example of the success of their principle. But they overlook one fundamental fact which wrecks all their calculations . This is that during the war period the question of finding a market for the products of industry presented no problem. Capitalism's task now is not to improve produc- tion, which was all the Wa r Industries Board did, but to find markets for its commodities. The movement now for capitali st \"planning\" will come to a no better end than the even more enthusiastic movement for the famous slogan, \"Mass produc- tion and high wages,\" in the \"new capit alism\" era. But the capitalist \"planners\" have also passed from the word to the dee d. Only calamitous fail- ure has been the result. In the United States capitalist \"planning' has pr oved no more effective in checking the crisis than have the Economic Councils of Germany an d France. We have already remarked the sad fate of Hoover's \"planned\" building boom an d his \"planned\" main- tenance of high wages, bu t the most outstanding examples of Hoover's \"planning\" are the adven- tures of the Federal Farm Board in wheat and cotton. These are comparable only to the exploits of Jack, the giant-killer, or Sindbad, the sailor. With wheat and cotton in deep crisis from"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"ATTEMPTS TO LIQUI DATE CRISIS 167 over-production, the Hoover government set out blithely to \"stabilize\" thes e great crops, of course, in the interests of the capit alist elements in agricul- ture. The government's co nfidence was equalled only by its arrogance and stupidity. It set up the Federal Farm Board an d gave it $500,000,000 with which to begin its great work of capitalist \"planning\" by cu tting production, regulating sales and boosting prices. Let us first see what happened to wheat: the Farm Board bought some 330,000,000 bushels of wheat and carried on a wi de propaganda for re- duced acreage, backed up by refusals of the banks to make loans to small farmers. The general re- sult was that the price of wheat dropped about 40 cents a bushel, production was 35,000, 000 bushels more in 1931 than in 1 930, the unmarketable sur- plus of wheat is larger than ever and the Farm Board has thrown away vast sums of money. Quoting Stone, the head of the Farm Board, the New York Times, (Nov., 1931), says, \"The Farm Board's holdings of whea t on Oct. 31, totalling 189,656,187 bushels, re presented an investment of $1.17 a bushel . . . about $222,000,000. It was worth on Oct. 31 about (57 cts. a bushel, WZF) $120,000,000 or $102,000,00 0 less than cost.\" Capitalist \"planning,\" Hoov er brand, made a no less brilliant showing in co tton. Again, as in the case of wheat, th e market price of cotton has fallen about 60%, many millions of dollars have been "},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"168 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA squandered, and producti on, despite the Farm Board's notorious slogan, \"Plow under each third row of cotton,\" has been increased 700,000 bales over last year. Says the New York Times, fur- ther quoting the \"planner,\" Mr. Stone: \"In cotton the Farm Board on Oct. 31, held 1,310,789 bales, representing on the same basis as wheat, an in- vestment of 18 cents a pound, or about $120,000,- 000. The value of the cotton at quotations on Oct. 31, was about (6 cents a pound, WZF) $45,- 000,000, or a loss of $75,000,000.\" These official figures of the Farm Board show a loss to the governmen t of $177,000,000. But this by no means covers all; it accounts only for the devaluation of the stocks now on hand. There should be added another $100,000,000 or so on ac- count of the vast quantities of wheat and cotton sold for less than the purchase price. Besides, there are the many hundreds of millions lost by the farmers themselves. Thus operates capitalist \"planning\" even under powerful American imperialism. The wheat and cotton farmers have been im poverished to the point of pauperization; the crisis of over-production has been intensified; hundreds of mill ions of dollars have been handed over to the bankers and specu- lators in wheat and cotton. And meanwhile, as the storehouses are bursti ng with the unsaleable wheat and cotton, millions of unemployed workers and their families clamor in vain for bread and "},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"ATTEMPTS TO LIQUI DATE CRISIS 169 clothes. All this is a clear example of the suicide economics of capitalism, of the forces that impel the workers and poor farm ers towards the estab- lishment of a Soviet United States. The Question of an Organized Capitalism T HE DEVELOPMENT of the movement for capitalist \"planning\" raises afresh the question of whether or not an organized capita list system is possible, for proposals of a \"pla nned\" capitalist economy- are proposals of an \"org anized capitalism.\" Here the Social Fascists come forward in full panoply. They are the special cham pions of the theory of organized capitalism, alt hough the present crisis has given them a sad jolt. Hilferding, (Arbeiter Zeitung, Vienna, Jan. 1, 1930), says: \"The year of 1928 was a year of powerful development of organized capitalism. A ne w capitalist era com- menced in 1929. Modern capitalism is overcom- ing and removing everythi ng which made for the anarchy of capitalist production.\" The theory of organized capitalism is found best developed in Hilferding's and Kautsky's conception of super-imperialism, and it is a foundation premise of Social Fascism in ge neral. Kautsky and other Social Fascist theoretician s hold that the process of capitalist trustificati on is overcoming and will continue to overcome the c ontradictions of capital- ism. That is, eventual ly trustification will become "},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"170 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA world-wide, thus at once liquida ting the economic crisis, abolishing the clas s struggle, and dissolving the war conflicts between the rival imperialist na- tions into an organized and monopolized world system of production and distribution. Mean- while, as this develops, cap italism will at the same time, by a process of pur chase by the ever-more democratic State, be gradua lly turned into a system of Socialism. This is th e theory of the peaceful evolution of capitalism into Socialism. But this whole theory of organized capitalism goes contrary to the most basic development of capitalism. The capitalist system cannot be \"or- ganized\"; it is fundament ally competitive and chaotic. An ordered, bala nced social system is incompatible with the private ownership of the industries and land and with production for profit. Monopolization, instead of diminishing the contra- dictions of the capitalist system, is in creasing and deepening them. While tr ustification undoubt- edly brings a modicum of regulation and system within the confines of its direct organization, it at the same time, aggravates the conflicts within capi- talism as a whole. With the development of mo- nopolization, in this period of imperialism, of the decline of capitalism and of the rise of Socialism, the collisions increase in severity between trusts and untrustified industry, between the trusts them- selves, between industries as such, between the vari- ous imperialist nations, between the producers and "},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"ATTEMPTS TO LIQUI DATE CRISIS 171 the exploiters, and between the decaying capitalist system and the advancing Soviet Union. This process of growing conflict and struggle is thus stated in the Program of the Communist Inter- national: \"The development of capitalism, and particularly the imperialist epoch of its de velopment, reproduces the fundamental contradictions of capitalism upon an in- creasingly magnified scale. Competition among small capitalists ceases, only to mate way for competition be- tween big capitalists ; where competition between big capi- talists subsides, it flares up between gigantic combinations of capitalist magnates and their governments ; local and national crises become transformed into world crises af- fecting a number of countries and, subsequently, into world crises; local wars give way to wars between coali- tions of states and world wars; the class struggle changes from isolated actions of sing le groups of workers into nation-wide conflicts and subs equently, into an inter- national struggle of the worl d proletariat against the world bourgeoisie. Finally, two main forces are or- ganizing against the organized might of finance capital — on the one hand the workers in the capitalist states, on the other hand, the victims of oppression of foreign capital, the masses of the people in the colonies, marching under the leadership and hegemony of the international revolutionary movement.\" The decisive trend in ca pitalism is towards the sharpening of its contradi ctions. Nor will this be overcome by the process of trustification. As the tendency develops to \"organ ize,\" that is, to trustify sections of capitalist econom y, this tendency is out- "},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"172 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA run by the counter-tendenc y to sharpen and deepen the antagonisms within th e capitalist system and between it and the new Socialist system of the Soviet Union. In short, th e very process of capi- talist monopolization speed s capitalist society ever faster along the road to imperialist war and pro- letarian revolution. Lenin thus analyses capital- ist development: \"There is no doubt that the development is going in the direction of a single world trust that will swallow up all enterprises and all St ates without ex ception. But the development in this di rection is proceeding under such stress, with such a tem po, with such contradictions, conflicts, and convulsions—not only economical, but also political, national, etc., etc.— that before a single world trust will be reached, before the respective national finance capitalist will have formed a world union of 'ultra-imperialism,' imperialism will inevitably explode, capitalism will turn into its opposite.\" 5 (b) Futile Efforts to Qu ench the Class Struggle T HE MAJOR social contradiction of the capitalist system is the conflict in interest between the own- ing capitalist class an d the producing working class. This gives rise to class struggle, the capi- talists always seeking to more intensely exploit the workers, and the workers struggling to retain the products of their labor. The class struggle, as we have already seen, becomes ever sharper with the 5 Preface to Bukharin's Imperialism and World Economy, p. 14."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"ATTEMPTS TO LIQUI DATE CRISIS 173 intensification of the gene ral crisis of capitalism, and it eventually culminat es in the proletarian revolution. Necessarily, the capitalis t class has always had as a fundamental objective the liquidation or soft- ening of this revolutionary contradiction. But the facts demonstrate that it is proving no more suc- cessful in accomplishing this than it is in its ef- forts to wipe out the basic economic contradiction of capitalism, the conflict between the capitalist modes of production and di stribution. In spite of all the efforts of the capitalists to quench the class struggle, by damping dow n or beating out the workers' opposition, it flar es up ever broader, more vigorously and more menacing to capitalism. Throughout the capitalist wo rld the trend of the exploiters is towards Fa scism; that is, to push through their offensive ag ainst the working class by policies of extreme demagogy and violence. The speed of the developm ent of Fascism and the forms that it takes in th e various countries depend upon the extent to which th e capitalist crisis has progressed. Fascism develops along two main channels; that is, open Fa scism and Social Fas- cism. In Italy and some of the Balkan countries, where the revolutionary cr isis early became acute, Fascism came into power by the violent seizure of the State power, followed by the wholesale smash- ing of workers' uni ons, cooperativ es, political "},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"174 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA parties, the complete li quidation of bourgeois de- mocracy, the setting up of government trade unions, etc. In other coun tries the capitalists, ap- proaching the crisis at a somewhat slower pace, follow, at least at the out set, the \"dry road\" or \"legal\" way to Fascism. By this process of fas- ciszation the Bruening government in Germany is gradually developing the Fascist dictatorship; the MacDonald government in Great Britain is going in the same direction; Ja pan is openly menaced by Fascism; and in the Unite d States many Fascist tendencies are in evidence, as exampl ed by the dic- tatorial methods of Hoove r in the question of un- employment relief, etc.; by the decline in prestige of parliamentary governme nt and the demand for a \"strong man\" dictator; by the demand of the American Legion conven tion for a \"peace-time National Council of Defe nse\"; by the appearance of many Fascist \"planning\" schemes (Swope, Woll, etc.), and by the wa ve of unpunished lynch- ings, wholesale arrest a nd deportation of militant workers, etc. One of the most basic features of this trend of world cap italism towards Fascism is the gradual fasciszation of the conservative trade unions and Socialist parties. From Social Reformism to Social Fascism I T HAS always been a policy of the capitalist class, especially in the imperialis t countries, to split and "},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"ATTEMPTS TO LIQUI DATE CRISIS 175 weaken the working cla ss by making certain con- cessions to the skilled work ers. This provided the base of Social Reformism. The Socialist parties of the world and such trad e unions as the Ameri- can Federation of Labor fitte d themselves into this bosses' strategy, seeking to develop the skilled workers as a privileged ar istocracy of labor. They based their organization, economic and political, upon the skilled workers, ignoring or openly be- traying the unskilled work ers, as a thousand sold-out strikes testify. They cultivated illusions among the skilled workers th at their interests lie in collaboration with the bourgeoisie rather than in class struggle of the workers. Social Reform- ism was and is a tool of the capitalist class in its struggle against the work ing class. The Social Reformists are in realit y, as Lenin called them, \"agents of the bourgeoisie in the ranks of the workers.\" The hey-day of Social Reformism was during the early, \"peaceful\" stage of capitalist develop- ment and in the first phase of imperialism. This general period may be said to have closed with the beginning of the World War. In this period, with the world capitalist system generally on the upgrade, the capitalists, especially in United States, England and Ge rmany, could and did make many concessions to the skilled workers. Few of these, however, seeped down to the un- skilled and semi-skilled, who remained in a state "},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"176 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA of poverty. Upon this economic foundation So- cial Reformism built for it self a strong mass fol- lowing among the workers. But the development of the general crisis of capitalism has changed th e complexion though not the basic role of the Soci al Reformistic \"lieuten- ants of capital.\" The empl oyers, trying to find a way out of their difficultie s and to preserve their profits at the expense of the workers, intensify their wage-cut drive, reduction of unemployment benefits, etc.; not even the skilled workers, al- though they are partly shielded, escaping the rapid downward trend. The old system of concessions to the skilled workers, th e basis of Social Reform- ism, becomes increasingly narrowed down and is succeeded by more direct and rigorous methods of repression. Adapting themselves to the needs of the em- ployers, the reformist So cialist and trade union leaders have developed their movement into an organ of the bosses for the Fascist repression and intensified exploitati on of the working class. They have practically gr afted the Social Democ- racy and the conservative unions onto th e capitalist State and the employers' exploitation machinery. They devote to capitalism their long-established prestige as workers' leaders, their strong organi- zational control over the ma sses, and their unques- tioned demagogic skill in co vering up thei r services to capitalism with pleas th at it is all necessary in "},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"ATTEMPTS TO LIQUI DATE CRISIS 177 the building of Socialism. Where necessary they do not hesitate to use open violence against the revolutionary toilers. The policy of the Social Democracy is basically that of Fascism; the beat- ing back of the proletar ian revolution, the saving of capitalism and the prof its of the employers at the expense of the worker s. The principal differ- ence is that Social Demo cracy hides its Fascism under a mask of Marxian Socialism. Thus, in the period of the decline of cap italism, Social Reform- ism becomes Social Fascism. The Fasciszation of the American Federation of Labor I N THE A.F. of L. the process of fasciszation is far advanced. In fact, the top leadership of this organization, the Greens, Wolls, Lewises, etc., are already practically open-F ascist. They are brazen defenders of capitalism. They have become the chief strike-breaking agen cy of the employers. To this end they work hand-in-glove with the Hoover government, the American Legion, the Ku Klux Klan, the National Civic Federation, the Chambers of Commerce, th e churches, and all and sundry other institutions of the employers for the exploitation of the workers. Thei r policy is to make the trade unions more company-union-like than the company unions themselves. Politically illiterate and with the syco phancy typical of para- "},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"178 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA. sites, these leaders take their \"opini ons\" ready- made from the most reactionary sections of the bourgeoisie. They greedily lap up every mess of capitalist economics and politic s that their masters set before them. Developi ng Fascism in the United States has a main foundatio n in the lead ership of the American Federation of Labor. Their sys- tem of craft unionism, main tained as against in- dustrial unionism to prevent unity of action by the workers and to furnish additional jobs to officials, is a shameless method of union scabbery. Their endorsement of election cand idates of the capital- ist parties, or \"reward- your-friends\" po licy, is a plain sell-out of the wo rking class. Their support of the rationalization of industry is part of the speed-up program of the bos ses. Their systematic betrayal of the Negroes, women and young work- ers dovetails into the employers' special exploita- tion of these sections of the workers. Their long years of peddling the in terests of the unskilled workers and their breaking up of attempts of these workers to organize constitutes the greatest of all their crimes against the working class. They are saturated with graft — racketeering was born in the A.F. of L. With th eir huge salaries, ranging from $10,000 to $20, 000 yearly or as much as those of United States governors, senators, etc., they have nothing in common with the workers in their way of living and thinking. So faithful a servant of capitalism is the A.F, of L. leadership that, if "},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"ATTEMPTS TO LIQUI DATE CRISIS 179 one wants to know its polic y in any field of politics or economies, all that is n ecessary is to find out the policy of the bosses an d you have the answer. The present tasks of the A.F. of L. leadership, dictated by the employers, are to defeat the de- mand of the workers for unemployment insurance and relief, to push thro ugh the employers' wage- cutting campaign, to advance the preparations for imperialist war, to beat back the advance of the Trade Union Unity League and the revolutionary minorities in the reformist unions. In the question of unemployment the A.F. of L. leadership sinks to the gr eatest depths of cynical betrayal of the worker s. The Vancouver, 1931, convention of the A.F. of L., re-affirming the ex- isting policy, said: \"C ompulsory unemployment insurance legislation such as is now in effect in Great Britain and Germany would be unsuited to our economic and political requirements and are unsatisfactory to Amer ican workmen.\" When Green, Woll and Co. say th is they speak for their capitalist masters, not for the workers. The A.F. of L. convention which co uld adopt such a decision was made up of 90% high-pa id officials; the work- ers had no voice or representation. The A.F. of L. membership, who favor unemployment insur- ance, have never in any way been consulted or given an opportunity to express their opinion on the question. The A.F. of L. leadership, either openly or by th eir silence, have endorsed every "},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"180 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA attack of the police upon unemployed demon- strations. The millions of unemployed workers, destitute of unemployment insurance and in a con- dition of semi-starvation, have the A.F. of L. very much to thank for their present plight. It may be that under the growing mass pressure many A.F. of L. leaders will be forced to tip their hat to \"unemployment insurance\" of the Groves Law type, (half a dozen governor s having endorsed it), but this demagogy will not change their real op- position. The A.F. of L. leaders are a central pillar of the Hoover program of starving the unem- ployed. The A.F. of L. leaders are also a principal in- strument of the bosses for cutting the workers' wages. During the past two years, despite the Hoover-Green no-wage-cu t agreement, the wages of the workers in practica lly every industry have been slashed and the A.F. of L. has not waged a single major strike against this offensive. Where the militancy of the workers has forced strikes, (Ohio miners, needle trades , etc.), these have been betrayed into means for accomplishing wage-cuts. Agreeing with the bosses that the standards of the workers must come down, the A.F. of L. leaders have adopted a policy of \"voluntary\" wage-cuts. They are accepting cuts off- hand in th e building, textile, printing, clothing and other industries all over the country, and glorying in them as victories. Matthew Woll called the recent \"voluntary\" "},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"ATTEMPTS TO LIQUI DATE CRISIS 181 cut of the railroad work ers, which was a most shameful sell-out, \"an achievement such as we have never before witnesse d in the United States.\" In their wage-cutting program the A.F. of L. leaders do not hesitate to cut the wages of organ- ized workers even below those of the unorganized. In the Colorado mines of the Rocky Mountain Fuel Co. the U.M.W. of A. leaders \"voluntarily\" gave up 50% of the workers' pay in order to enable that company to out-comp ete its competitors. In West Virginia, the U.M. W. of A. leader Van Bittner declared that he would \"outscab the scabs,\" and signed an agreement with the Purs- glove Company, cutting the already starvation wages of its 1600 workers from 30 to 22 cents per ton, thereby reducing them far below the unorganized miners of the vicinity. The Ameri- can Federation of Full Fashioned Hosiery Work- ers, (U.T.W.), in the Fall of 1931, accepted a cut of 35% to 45%, sham elessly announcing that its purpose was to undercut the production costs of the non-union mills and to drive them out of business. In all this wage-cutting campaign no unions have been more active than the Socialist- controlled needle trades organizations. Not only does the A.F. of L. take the initiative in forcing through wage-c uts, but it also actively breaks the resistan ce of the workers, the unorgan- ized or those united in the Trade Union Unity League, when they strike against reductions of "},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"182 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA their standards, examples of this being the recent strikes in Western Pennsy lvania, Kentucky, Law- rence, Paterson, New York, etc. It used to be that when the employers broke strikes of their workers they called in su ch professional scab- herders as Farley, Pinker ton, the Feltz-Baldwins, etc., but now they use the Greens, Lewises, Doaks, Schlessingers, Hillmans, etc. Notoriously, the A.F. of L. leaders are milita- ristic jingoes, and suppor t every phase of the im- perialists' war program. They are rabid enemies of the Soviet Union. Th e A.F. of L. convention poisonously declar ed: \"We regard the Soviet re- gime in Russia as the mo st unscrupulous , most anti- social institution in the world today. Between it and our form of political and social organization, there can be no compromise of any kind.\" Their hatred of the U.S.S.R. is a class hatred, as is that of the employers. They fear the revolution like all other exploiters of labor, usually mo re acutely than even the capitali sts themselves. Naturally, to enforce in the unions the poli- cies of wage-cuts, star vation of the unemployed, speed-up, etc., more and more use has to be made of Fascist methods of control of these organiza- tions. Democracy, never vigorous in the A.F. of L. and railroad Brotherhoo ds, has now been prac- tically wiped out. The or ganizations are domi- nated from top to botto m by bureaucrats and "},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"ATTEMPTS TO LIQUI DATE CRISIS 183 gangsters; including the \"Socialist\" unions. The rank and file have little or nothing to say on vital questions of policy. Uni on elections are a farce, the ruling cliques stealing as many votes as they may require. Often they even refuse to put the opposition candidates on th e ballot. Conventions are packed with admini stration henchmen. The union journals are closed to all serious discussion. And when the workers object to this growing Fas- cist regime they face gangsterism and expulsion from the organizations. The employers directly as sist the reactionaries in controlling the unions. Rebellious workers in the unions are, upon the proposal of the union leaders, blacklisted fro m the industries. More than ever the check-off is used to hold the work- ers in the organizations by force (anthracite, needle trades, textiles, et c.). In Illinois, for ex- ample, the miners have le d several revolts against the U.M.W.A. but are st ill compelled, by the check-off, to remain members. Fascism everywhere seek s to amalgamate the trade unions with the Stat e, so that the workers may be the more effectiv ely controlled, Musso- lini's \"trade unions\" being actual State organs. Gradually the A.F. of L. and railroad unions are becoming Statized, being already practically the official government uni ons. Their foreign policy dovetails completely with that of American im- perialism and obediently follows all the windings "},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"184 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA of the State Department. Significantly, Mr. Hoover, together with a flock of governors, sena- tors, mayors, generals, etc., went to the Boston, (1930), convention to tell the A.F. of L. leaders to fight against unemplo yment insurance. And during the 1931 coal strike of the National Min- ers Union in Western Pennsylvania, President Hoover, Secretary Doak, and Governors Pinchot and White actively interfer ed to break the strike, assisting and often calling upon the coal operators to rebuild the U.M.W.A. and arranging confer- ences to this effect. Between the police and the A.F. of L. bureau- crats there is a close working arrangement. At the top Matthew Woll an d the Department of Justice cooperate in the issuance of their periodic joint \"red scares\"; at the bottom, the lesser officials turn the names of revolutionary workers over to the police. The Departmen t of Labor, when 35 members of Local 28 of the Sheet Metal Workers got out an injunction agai nst their crooked offi- cials, sent its agents to terrorize these workers as \"Reds,\" (New York Worl d-Telegram, Apr. 1, 1932) this being a direct support of A.F. of L. racketeer leaders by the Federal government. Nor do the courts fail in protecting the A.F. of L. officials against attacks by the workers. They issue injunctions against the TUUL unions on be- half of the A.F. of L.

In summing up their intellectual fasciszation, the Program of the Communist International, says: \"In the sphere of theory, So cial Democracy has utterly and completely betrayed Marxism, having traversed the road from revision to complete liberal bourgeois reform- ism and avowed social-imperialism; it has substituted in place of the Marxian theory of the contradictions of capitalism, the bourgeois theory of its harmonious de- velopment ; it has pigeon-holed the theory of crises and of the pauperization of the proletariat; it has turned the flaming and menacing theo ry of class struggle into prosaic advocacy of class peace; it has exchanged the theory of growing class antagonisms for the petty bour- geois fairy tale about the 'd emocratization' of capital; in place of the theory of th e inevitability of war under capitalism it has substituted the bourgeois deceit of pacifism and the lying propaga nda of 'ultra-imperialism'; it has changed the theory of the revolutionary downfall of capitalism for the counterf eit coinage of 'sound' capi- talism transforming itself peacef ully into Socialism; it has replaced revolution by evolution; the destruction of the bourgeois State by its active upbuilding, the theory "},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"186 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA of proletarian dictatorship by the theory of coalition with the bourgeoisie, the doctrine of international soli- darity — by preaching defense of the imperialist father- land ; for Marxian dialectical materialism it has sub- stituted the idealist philos ophy and is now engaged in picking up the crumbs of religion that fall from the table of the bourgeoisie.\" The practice of the Soci alist parties and trade unions conforms to this Fa scist theoretical degen- eration. There have b een no demands made upon them by capitalism in cris is which they have not obeyed. When the capitalists of the various coun- tries called upon them to organize the great World War they responded by id entifying everywhere their interests with those of their national bour- geoisie and by mobilizing the workers for the slaughter. And ever since they have worked with their capitalist masters to help them prepare the next war. In Great Britain the MacDonald \"So- cialist\" government main tained intact the great war machine of British im perialism; in Germany the Social Fascists voted for the rebuilding of the German navy; in France they prepared the in- famous universal military service law now in force; in Poland, Czecho-Slovak ia and many other coun- tries they vote the war budgets. Ev erywhere they are the special decoy ducks of capitalist pacifism, the shield of imperialist war. In the war plans of the capitalist nations against the Soviet Union the Social Democrats play a lead- "},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"ATTEMPTS TO LIQUI DATE CRISIS 187 ing role. They scoff at the danger of capitalist war against the Soviet Union and thus disarm the workers' defense; they ma ke the capitalist war ap- pear as a fight against au tocracy in the U.S.S.R. The Social Fascists hate the Soviet Union because they see in it the living refutation of their whole policy, a menacing threat to the capitalist system of which they are the mo st profound theoretical and practical defenders. They have never hesi- tated, (in Georgia and elsewhere), to take up arms against the Soviet Union. The exposures in the recent political trials in Moscow showed that the Second International is working hand-in-glove with the French imperia lists in preparing armed intervention against the U.S.S.R. As a recent resolution of the Communist International says: \"The Social Democracy ha s turned itself into a shock-brigade of world im perialism which is pre- paring for war against the U.S.S.R.\" The special task of the Soci al Fascists is to dis- credit the Soviet Union among the workers. As we have seen, they are th e most skilled in building up arguments against the Soviet Union, covering their sophistries with a cloak of pseudo-Marxism. They take up every capi talist anti-Soviet lie and assiduously propagate it among the workers. These they alternate with hypocritical pretensions of friendship, knowing that the masses are sympa- thetic to the U.S.S.R.

In Great Britain, by their betrayal of the great general strike and by the debacle of the Labor government, the Social Fascists threw demoralizati on into the ranks of the workers and petty bourgeois sympathizers, giving direct encouragement to Fascism. In Germany the Social Fascist lead ers are clearing the way for Fascism through their theory and practice of \"the lesser evil.\" With the argument that the starvation capitalist system is a \"lesser evil\" than the dictatorship of the proletariat they support the Bruening government, with its wholesale wage- cuts, suppression of the workers' rights and pro- gram of gradual fasciszation. Under the name of Socialism they call upon the workers to vote for the monarchist, von Hind enburg. In many places they join hands with the Hitlerites and police for armed attacks on the Communists. To the Social Fascists the major danger is the Communist revo- lution; to defeat this th e end justifies the means. The \"fight\" between Social Fascism and Fas- cism is so much \"sound and fury signifying nothing.\" The two movements are blood-brothers.

The Social Fascists would maintain the semblance of capitalist democracy as the best means of forestalling the revolution and they would be its administ rators; whereas the Fas- cists would sweep aside this fake democracy and its champions and proceed to more direct methods of repression. But an accommodation of these conflicting ideas and intere sts is being arrived at by the gradual fasciszation of the State and of the mass organizations of th e Social Democrats. In due season the Social Fascist leaders, in the name of Socialism, will join with the Hitlerites in shoot- ing down the revolutionary workers. It is because of the essential unity of Fascism and Social Fas- cism that Hamilton Fish, one of the most conscious Fascists in this country, could enthusiastically en- dorse Norman Thomas for office in the 1931 elections. 10 The Mussolinis, P ilsudskis, Briands, and MacDonalds are only fully-matured Social Democrats.

Its aim is to delude the worker s with promises of dras- tic relief, while at the same time holding them tied in practical policy to th e basic capitalist program of exploitation. It is a means to prevent the masses from following the leadership of the Com- munists. Of such demagogues the Fascists are outstanding examples. Before Mussol ini seized power his program was extremely \"rad ical,\" containing de- mands for a republic, supp ression of all chambers of commerce and stock comp anies, confiscation of church properties, nationa lization of the war in- dustries, etc., all of which he completely repudiated in practice. At the present time Hitler is trying to carry out the same Mu ssolini strategy, to de- ceive the German masses with pretenses of radi- calism as a screen fo r the naked capitalist dictatorship and exploita tion he has in store for them. The new-found radi calism of the Roose- velts, Pinchots, LaFollet tes, Murphys, Father Coxes, etc., is of essentially the same stripe in this country, so much empt y demagogy to win a mass following of the discontented. The Social Fascists are still more dangerous mas- ters at this demagogic art. As we have seen they have, under pretense of righting for Socialism, backed up every plan th at capitalism has put for- ward for saving itself and more intensely exploiting the toilers. Under the fig-leaf of Socialism they "},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"ATTEMPTS TO LIQUI DATE CRISIS 195 supported the World War, the Versailles Treaty, the Dawes and Young Plan s, the Kellogg Pact, the Chinese butcher, Chan g Kai Shek, and the In- dian faker, Gandhi. Even as these lines are being written, they are working together with the Span- ish coalition government to shoot down the heroic revolt of the Spanish wo rkers, (Dai ly Worker, Jan. 23, 1932). Nor ar e the Greens and Wolls lacking anything in demagogic ability, with their blather about the 5-hour day, their vague talk of \"revolution if someth ing is not done,\" etc. But the most insidious and dangerous to the workers of all this crop of demagogues are the so- called \"left\" Social Fasc ists.

They are the radical phrase-mongers par exce llence. Their objective task is the confusion of th e most advanced elements of the workers and ther efore the breaking up of serious movements against the capitalist s and their reactionary labor henchmen. Throughout the Sec- ond International there are such gr oupings, in- cluding the Maxtonites in Great Britain, the \"left\" Social Democrats in Germany, the various renegade Communist gr ouplets, etc. Trotzky belongs to this general category. The harm of such elements is typically illustrated by Trotzky's present denial of an im mediate war danger between "},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"196 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA Japan and the U.S.S.R., while at the same time he poses as an ultra-revolutionist. During the post-war revolutionary upheavals in Germany and other countries such pseudo-left ele- ments sprang up, formin g a separate world or- ganization, the so-called 2 1/2 International. These \"lefts,\" despite many radical phrases, always supported the right Social Democrats against the Communists, thereby doing much to break up the revolutionary attacks of the worker s upon capi- talism. After the worker s were defeated the \"lefts\" amalgamated with the Second Inter- national, of which, at a ll times, they were essen- tially a specialized part. Now, in this great crisis, they are attempting to come forth and repeat their treacherous role of 1918-23. In the United States the principal representa- tive of this insidious pse udo-revolutionary tendency is the Conference for Progr essive Labor Action, or the so-called Muste group. This is made up of miscellaneous \"progressive\" petty trade union bureaucrats, remnants of the old Labor party movements, libe rals and Brookwood intellectuals, dilettante churchmen, so cial workers, etc. Its chief political expression is the \"left\" Stanley group in the Socialist party and its principal activi- ties are on the trade union field.

Th ey serve to give the whole tendency a more \"red\" tinge with their pre- tense at Communism; but their practice dovetails with the Muste group. The \"left\" Social Fascists are in reality specialized troops of the reactionary bureaucrats for struggle ag ainst the revolutionary sections of the working class. The line of the Muste grou p is typical of such tendencies the world over. While criticising the betrayals of the A.F. of L. leaders and the So- cialist party, they nevert heless give them practical support. They are bitte r enemies of the Com- munist party and the Tr ade Union Unity League. They are special opponents of the policy of in- dependent revolutionary uni ons, seeking to draw the unorganized workers under the control of the American Federation of Labor. They are the loyal \"opposition\" within the A.F. of L. They talk of starting a more radical Socialist party as a rival to the Communist party. In its short life of abou t three years the Muste group has clearly shown the unity of its basic policy with that of the A.F. of L. How this \"radical\" group ma kes a division of labor with the A.F. of L. leaders is typically illustrated by the campaign of the A.F. of L. to \"organize\" the Southern textile worker s recently. On the one hand, Mr. Green, accompanie d by an efficiency en- gineer, Jeffrey Browne, pr oposed to \"organize\" the textile workers by offering to speed them still more "},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"198 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA and to kill off radicalis m among them. Along this line he spoke to many Sout hern Chambers of Com- merce and employers' asso ciations. \"The policies he advocated,\" says the Memphis Commercial Ap- peal , \"might have come with propriety from the President of the American Banking Association.\" On the other hand, the Muste group got into action to help Green control the workers within his reac- tionary scheme. Muste grew enthusiastic over the campaign, called upon the workers to give the A.F. of L. misleaders an organizing fund of $1,- 000,000, sent his speakers to talk radical to the workers at the mill gates, and his organizers to play a shameful role in the final strike sell-outs. Thus this \"progressive\" wing of the A.F. of L. cooperated perfectly with the top bureaucracy to defeat the militant movement of the Southern workers and to keep them away from the revolu- tionary National Text ile Workers Union. The recent Lawrence stri ke was another typical example of the Musteites as auxiliaries of the A.F. of L. leadership. W ith the A.F. of L. ac- cepting wage-cuts all over th e country on principle, manifestly it could not affo rd to have these 23,000 unorganized textile workers win their strike against the wage-cut. The A.F. of L. organizers went into Lawrence to bring a bout the acceptance of the cut, that is, to sell-out the strike. The Musteites helped them.

In the 1931 Pater- son strike of silk work ers there was a complete united front of capitalist politicians, A.F. of L., Socialist Party, Muste group, Lovestoneites, etc., against the National Textile Workers Union. Every \"left\" maneuver of the A.F. of L. bu- reaucrats to deceiv e the masses has the enthusiastic support of the Muste gr oup and their renegade Communist allies. The puttin g over of the recent general wage-cut of the railroad workers provided a good example of Musteism in practice. From the outset of the negotia tions between the com- panies and the union lead ers it was evident that the latter intended to acc ept the cut after making a few maneuvers to creat e the impression among the rank and file that th ey were fighting the com- panies' proposition. Manifestly, the task of every militant was to expose this plot and to organize the workers against it. But no sooner did the latter begin their sham ba ttle against the cut than Muste's paper, The Labor Age, Dec, 1931, declared: \"The fact that the twenty-one railroad labor unions in this country have informed a com- mittee of railroad presiden ts that they will not accept a 'voluntary' cut in wages of 10% is a hopeful sign.

The Bankruptcy of Social Fascism Now LET us see whether or not capitalism is de- veloping in Social Fascis m a means with which it can quench the class str uggle and beat down the surging proletarian revol ution. Even a cursory glance shows that with the narrowing of the eco- nomic base of Social Fascism, caused by the in- ability of capitalism to so widely corrupt the labor aristocracy, goes a narrowi ng of its mass base among the working class. So cial Fascism is bank- rupt in theory and practice and, despite (and be- cause of) the support it ge ts from the employers and the State, it is entering into a period of disin- tegration. By its daily role in the class struggle Social Fascism shows itself to be the road, not to Socialism but to the still deeper en slavement of the workers. The Social Democratic th eory that th e capitalist \"democracy\" would gradually evolve into a Social- ist government leads in ha rd reality to Socialist support of growing Fascis t dictatorships all over the capitalist world; its conception of a steadily rising standard of living for the workers under an organized capitalism leads, in the decaying capi- talist system, to the acce ptance of wholesale wage- cuts, starvation of the un employed, preparations for war against the Soviet Union, etc. "},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"ATTEMPTS TO LIQUI DATE CRISIS 201 Inevitably the meaning of all this is seeping into the minds of the ma sses of workers who have hitherto followed the lead of the Social Democrats. Although they still have many stubborn illusions, they are learning that the Social Democracy is their enemy, and they are starting to turn against it. Hence, there is beginn ing a world-wide decline in the mass influence and organizational strength of the Social Democracy and a growth of the Com- munist movement. In Germany, where the capi- talist crisis is farthest advanced and the process of fasciszation of the Soci al Democracy most com- plete, the above trends ar e best illustrated. Thus, while the vote of the So cial Democratic party steadily falls off, that of the Communist party, 4,982,000 in the recent elect ion, as rapidly increases. Nor is the United States an exception to this general tendency. Since the war the A.F. of L. has lost about 2,000,000 members. The United Mine Workers, once the ba ckbone of the A.F. of L., has been reduced to one-fourth of its former membership and, because of its reactionary poli- cies, it has become a sten ch in the nostrils of the miners. During the past two years the building trades unions have lost at least one-third of their members and other unions accordingly. Moreover, throughout the A.F. of L. , there is brewing an explosive rank and file oppo sition to the reactionary policies of the leaders. Never was the prestige of the A.F. of L. so low among its members and the "},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"202 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA broad masses of workers. As against all this, there is the spreading mass in fluence of the Communist party and the Trade Union Unity League. The capitalists, naturally, do not passively ob- serve the disintegration of Social Fascism, but try to save it. Thus Ameri can employers are defi- nitely cultivating the reactionary unions more and more. This amounts, in substance, to a modifica- tion of their historic open-shop policy. This tendency manifests itself in many ways, such as the \"re-build the U.M.W. of A.\" movement; the \"granting\" of the check- off to the anthracite miners; the close collabor ation of the bosses, the government and the union leaders in the fake needle trades strikes; the recognition accorded the shop unions by th e railroad companie s in the recent wage negotiations for many roads where they had no members, the close coope ration of th e A.F. of L. and the Federal government, etc. One of the most recent and striking mani- festations of this tend ency was the practically unanimous passage of the Norris-La Guardia Anti-Injunction bill. This bill, which presuma- bly abolishes the \"yellow dog\" contract and limits the power of federal courts to issue injunc- tions, in reality does not do away with injunctions at all, but lays the ba sis for their application primarily against the revo lutionary unions. It is a definite move to facili tate the organization of the A.F. of L. unions, a nd to give their reactionary "},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"ATTEMPTS TO LIQUI DATE CRISIS 203 leaders a \"paper victory\" to support the paralyzing non-partisan A.F. of L. political policy. It does not originate in a sudden burst of liberalism on the part of the government, but in a realization of the necessity to develop th e A.F. of L. leadership still further as a stri ke-breaking organization. The capitalist policy to strengthen Social Fascism as a barrier against the Communist party and the Trade Union Unity League is further ex- pressed in the distinct cu ltivation of the Socialist party that is now to be seen all over the country. The S.P. has become a thoroughly respectable party of \"opposition.\" The capitalists realize that the lack of a strong social reformist movement is a great disadvantage for them , hence, they are con- sciously building the Socialist party as a weapon against the Communist party. Its candidates and activities are given access to every avenue of pub- licity. The endorsement of Norman Thomas by most of the capitalist press in New York in the recent elections shows the way the wind is blowing. The capitalists know their own. Such methods of galvaniz ing Social Fascism into life must fail. The masses of workers can never be dragooned into organizati ons that are so mani- festly carrying out policies hostile to their interest. But this is not to minimize the danger. The Social Fascist method of obscu ring the capitalist policy under the guise of Socialis m is an insidious menace. It is now and will remain until the revolution the "},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"204 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA most dangerous capitalis t influence among the working class, the most serious brake upon the class struggle. The progress of the revolutionary movement is to be measured by th e breaking of the Social Democracy's grip upon the workers, ideo- logically and organizationally. That there is such a br eaking-down process now going on is self-evident, a nd this disintegration will increase with the sh arpening of the general crisis of capitalism. The Social Demo cratic illusions of the masses are weakening, desp ite the frantic efforts of the \"left\" phrase-mongers to keep them alive. Less and less able are the employers to put into effect their traditional policy of corrupting the strategically situated labor aristocracy and thus to play them off against the re st of the wo rking class. The differences between the skilled and unskilled are diminishing, the worki ng class is becoming uni- fied. More and more skil lful become the newly- organized Communist part ies in mobilizing the rebellious masses. Conse quently, the employers are compelled to make ev er greater use of open force against the workers, to resort to a policy of naked Fascism. The Futility of Fascism A BOVE , we have pointed out the tendency towards the development of Fascis m in all capit alist coun- tries. Italy is the cl assical example of this tend- "},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"ATTEMPTS TO LIQUI DATE CRISIS 205 ency carried to its logi cal conclusion. Defenders of capitalism the world ove r have looked hopefully towards Italy for a solution of the capitalist crisis. Mussolini, as well as Ford , seemed to have the an- swer for capitalism's woes . But we shall see that this is not so. Fascism is not an altern ative to capitalism; it is capitalism, the most extreme expression of the capitalistic dictatorsh ip. As Manuilsky says: \"The Fascist regime is no t a new type of State; it is one of the forms of the bourgeois dictatorship in the epoch of imperialism.\" 11 Fascism does not amend capitalist economi cs. The economic policy of Fascism is the familiar capitalist program of the exploitation of the work ers and poor farmers. The difference between Fascism and a bourgeois democratic regime is that the former is more ex- treme and brutal in its e xploitation of the toilers. As Manuilsky says further: \"The main factor in Fascism is its open offens ive against the working class with the employment of every form of vio- lence and coercion.\" Th us, inevitably, Fascism deepens the contradictions of capitalist society. It must result in intensifyi ng the economic crisis and in stimulating the revolutionization of the toilers. The wide development of Fascism in various forms in the several capit alist countries is not a sign of capitalism growing stronger, but weaker. Fascism arises with the deepening of the capitalist 11 The Communist Parties and the Crisis of Capitalism, p. 36."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"206 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA crisis. It is the desper ate means by which capi- talism in its extremity of cr isis vainly tries to save itself. It is significant that Fascism is most de- veloped in exactly those countries that are the weakest links in the capitalist world chain. In some instances, to crush the workers, it incorpo- rates the Social Fascist parties and unions into its machinery; in others, it de stroys not only the So- cial Fascist organizations but also Liberal group- ings. Fascism is the instrument of finance capital. It speeds the development of State capitalism, linking the employers' organizations , \"trade unions,\" etc. directly to the government. Here, indeed, is a heaven for capitalist \"pla nners.\" Hence, all over the world, the advocates of an \"organized capi- talism\" have looked hopefully towards Italy. We even find people who fa lsely dub themselves Com- munists asserting that Fa scism can li quidate the economic crisis and do away with the class struggle. Thus V. F. Calverton says in The Modern Quar- terly, (Jan.-Mar., 1931) : \"In either case (Com- munism or Fascism, WZF) industry can be organized into a scientific unit, the pres ent dissipa- tion of energy be saved, and the friction of democratic struggle be destroyed.\" But capitalism's hope in Fascist Italy has been no less futile than its en thusiasm for the \"new capitalism\" in the United States. Italy is just as deep in the mud of the capitalist crisis as other "},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"ATTEMPTS TO LIQUI DATE CRISIS 207 countries are in its mire . During the past year Italian industrial produc tion has rapidly declined, examples of this decrea se being steel 16%, cotton 30%, automobiles 50%, etc., the general average of decline being about 40 %. Exports, notwith- standing government for ced-draft methods of dumping, have dropped seri ously. The crisis also manifests itself heavily in the realm of finance; the stocks of the larges t and most important in- dustrial undertakings ha ving fallen off 50% to 75% since 1929; in November the Banca Com- merciale Italiana, the la rgest bank in Italy, was saved from bankruptcy onl y by drastic govern- ment aid; in 1931 the government faced a deficit of 896,000,000 lire as agains t a surplus of 150,000,000 lire in 1930. The living standards of the Italian workers and peasants have also catas trophically declined. An Associated Press dispatch of Mar. 15, 1932, says: \"Italy's unemployed at th e end of February to- talled 1,147,000, a new hi gh and an increase of 96,000 in a month.\" Only one-fourth receive the beggarly unemployment benefits. Wages have been slashed as much as 40 % in the past four years. The prices paid to the peasants for their products have been similarly cut. So greatly have the masses been impoverished that Mussolini could cynically remark: \"It is fortunate for Italy that the Italian workers and p easants are not in the habit of eating more than once a day.\" "},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"208 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA The inevitable resu lt of such conditi ons is a rising revolutionary movement in Italy also, despite the ferocious terror. The Chi cago Tribune, (Feb. 20, 1932), says: \"A wave of unrest is sweeping Italy from North to South and in many places disturb- ances have taken on the character of mass risings of the countryside against the authorities . . . the ordinary police forces ar e helpless and only the ar- rival of reserves prevented the rioters from lynch- ing the authorities.\" Fascism, the weapon of big capitalists, bankers and land-owners, finds its chief mass base among the petty bourgeoisie until these eventually be- come revolutionized by the intolerable conditions. The mass of the worker s cannot be won over to Fascism. They see in Fa scism a murderous enemy of the working class. Th e most that the Musso- linis and Hitlers can do is to temporarily win the support of sections of office employees and agricultural workers and ot hers of the more back- ward and politically in experienced toilers. As the workers free themselv es from Social Demo- cratic illusions they go to Communism, not to Fascism. In his new book, As I See It, Norman Thomas develops the theory that the revolt of the workers cannot succeed in the face of the highly-destructive arms possessed by the capitalis ts, that the airplane can defeat the barricade. But this is only a call to the workers to surrende r. The ruling class, "},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"ATTEMPTS TO LIQUI DATE CRISIS 209 also under Fascism, must ha ve a mass base. It can not maintain power wit hout one, notw ithstanding all its airplanes and artillery . Fascism, as we have seen, has such a base in the pett y bourgeoisie, and Fascism will disintegrate as this base collapses. In Italy, Poland and other Fascist countries this dis- integration is clearly pro ceeding with the develop- ment of the capitalist crisis. The revolution attacks Fascism not only from without but from within. The proletarian revolution cannot be crushed by force, even wi th the assistance of the most tricky Social Fascist and Fascist demagogy. Chang Kai Shek slaughtered 200,000 militant workers and peasants in the greatest reign of terror of modern history, but the wave of revolution in China mounts higher and higher. Poland, in spite of its extreme Fascist terrorism, goes rapi dly to the revolutionary crisis. De Rivera in Spain learned something about trying to rule by violence, and the Russian Czar likewise. Hitler, if he comes to power in Germany, will eventually le arn the same bitter les- son. And in Italy there is a revolutionary storm brewing that will blow Fascism to bits. Mussolini was able to se ize the power in Italy because of the Socialist be trayal of the great metal strike of 1920, which demo ralized the workers who had hoped to make the re volution. Fascism is not an inevitable stage of th e capitalist dictatorship; the revolution may forestall it.

He means, a nd bluntly says he means, the real thing: revolution by force and violence.

Foster or the Communist organization he headed. But if it is not, the Americans who drafted the Constitution of the United States were wasting their words when they wrote Section 3 of Article III: \"Treason against the United States shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort.\" Naked, brutal, insolent, it is probable that Chapter 4, as much as anything else in TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA, spurred the order for the book's destruction. But was that because it was naked or brutal or insolent? No. The reason was more practical: TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA talked too much. It revealed far more than the Communist International was ready to reveal. There were other reasons, of course, why the men who direct the Communist conspiracy wanted the hook removed from the land of the living. For one thing, Josef Stalin was reversing directions. As early as the end of 1931 he had begun quietly to swing the Com- munist International away from the rock-hard Soviet line which for years had been the Comintern's official policy vis-a-vis the West. Stalin assured himself that he had the best of mo- tives for altering the Soviet position: the survival of the USSR. A dozen years before, World War I had struck down German militarism; now he could see it reviving. In the Far East, Japan had begun to loom as a definite threat — likewise militaristic — to the loose peacetime conditions under which Communism and the Soviet Union had been flourishing. Marshal Stalin smelled war. He decided he had better throw up some defenses. .. . The cost of one of the fortifications Stalin erected, so that Communism might be kept alive, has been "},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"NOTES ON CHAPTER 4 4-C borne, ever since, by the American taxpayer. Devious Josef Stalin euchered this country into pressing diplo- matic recognition upon the Soviet Union (1933). With the US having conferred respectability as well as survival upon the Kremlin, Stalin felt he might as well go so far as to join (1934) the League of Nations, though Moscow regarded it as an international alliance against the proletarian revolution. Naturally, Stalin's new smile of peace and friendship did not reach full bloom overnight. While Foster was writing TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA, his master's official attitude disclosed little evidence of a coming thaw. It came slowly. That is why some three years were to pass before the order came to destroy the Foster volume. Despite a wide-ranging campaign of suppression, TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA remained a thorn in the Comintern's side. After being troubled by it for seven- teen years from the time the book was published, his international bosses requir ed William Z. Foster to disassociate himself — publicly — from his magnum opus. Obediently, Foster cut loose: in a sworn deposi- tion introduced into the record of the first and most famous Smith Act trial of Communist leaders, in New York City, in 1949. Nonetheless, the old unyielding line had been the authoritative line when Foster wrote the book. And that line called for violence. \", . . the workers of the world,\" Foster proclaims, \"including those in this country, must and will take the revolutionary way out of the crisis. . . . they will abolish capitalism. . . . \" And, Foster goes on, \"By the term 'abolition' of capitalism we mean its overthrow in open struggle by the toiling masses , led by the proletariat.\" And, later in the chapter, he adds: \". . . To put an end to the capitalist system will require a consciously revo- "},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"4-D NOTES ON CHAPTER 4 lutionary act by the great toiling masses, led by the Communist party; that is, the conquest of the State power, the destruction of the State machine created hy the ruling class, and the organization of the proletarian dictatorship.\" Also, there is the statement in this chapter that \". . . the final solution of this intolerable situation can he achieved only by the overthrow of the capitalist sys- tem and the establishment of a Workers' and Farmers' government.\" Those who will carry out this bloody program, it is made plain as Chapter 4 progresses, are \". . . the work- ers, farmers, Negroes, lesser city bourgeoisie . . . suffi- cient potential revolutionary forces to put an end to capitalism.\" Are there really enough of these groups in the Com- munist Party of the USA to overturn the Government? No. \". . . The actual strength of the Communist move- ment in the United States is not something that can be accurately stated in just so many figures,\" Foster ad- mits. But he adds, darkly, \"\"It has to be measured largely by the general mass influence of the Party and its pro- gram.\" That 1932 situation is true to this day. The organized Communists are relatively few in number (to keep the \"Party\" small and ineffectual-looking is dis- arming to the US Government and to the American people), but their influence is enormous. It was enormous even in 1932. In that year, as TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA appeared, Communist Na- tional Chairman William Z. Foster was a candidate, on the Communist ticket, for th e US Presidency. In 1932 the known membership of the American Communist Party was only about twelve thousand. Foster nonethe- less polled just short of one hundred and three thou- sand votes! "},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"NOTES ON CHAPTER 4 4-E Incidentally, the Communist platform for that 1932 election, as shown in this chapter, contained an early reference to what has developed into one of the most troublesome cankers of the present-day world: Red China. The platform, as Fost er quotes from it, said that the Communists of the United States were \"Against imperialist war; for defense of the Chinese people and of the Soviet Union.\" It is a plank the Communists might have written today. Foster commits sacrelige in Chapter 4. He defies Karl Marx. The heretical assertion is made that \". . .

Instead, Foster says, \". . . capitalism will die sword in hand, fighting in vain to beat hack the oncoming revo- lutionary proletariat.\" At the center of that pr oletarian horde, Chapter 4 declares, are \"the workers\". To William Z. Foster, as to all Communist theoreticia ns, a \"worker\" is a wage- earner, in industry. A somewhat distant second in their scale of values is the \"working farmer\" or \"poor farmer*\", a species the Communists contrast with the agricultural \"small producer\". The latter is frowned upon as being the American kul ak, marked for eventual destruction. In bringing off the revolution, according to Foster, the \". . . small farmer will play a vital role in the de- veloping Communist movement in the United States.\" "},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"4-F NOTES ON CHAPTER 4 (Foster erred: the small farmer hasn't played a sig- nificant role in US Communism at all, much less a vital one.) Next, Comrade Foster discloses that the men at the controls of the Communist revolution in the United States were counting heavily on the Negro — \" . . . a great potentially revolutionary force.\" Actually, Amer- ican Communism regards the Negro with contempt, and holds that he is little more than cannon-fodder. Perhaps that is why Foster can declare so smugly that \". . . The Negro masses will make the very best fighters for the revolution.\" Furthermore, the revolution is to get recruits from \" . . the lesser city bourgeoisie\"; the \"\"small tradesmen, petty manufacturers, professionals, intellectuals, etc., that make up this big class.\" What Communism plans to do with them, after it wi ns, is another and not very happy story. Shortly thereafter comes a statement as shameful as it is true: \"Especially is there a trend among the petty bour- geois intellectuals towards Communism.'\" Another element the Communists are expecting to number among the revolutionaries is the United States military: \". . . The armed forces are not impervious to Communism simply because they have patriotic prop- aganda dinned into their ears and are subjected to a rigid discipline.\" (In saying that, Foster apparently knew something. A little over a decade later, he was to state that during World War II there were fifteen thousand members of the Communist Party in the US military forces!) Still other areas in which Communists are building their machine for overthrowing the Government, as in- dicated by this chapter, are: schools and colleges, the "},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"NOTES ON CHAPTER 4 4-G unemployed, \"mass organi zations\", ex-servicemen, heavy industry, defense plants, labor unions, the press, and legislative bodies (\". . .

But by no means does the list stop there, it is doubtful if there is any field of activity, from academy to zootomy, which the Communist conspiracy has not penetrated — and with intentions strictly dis- honorable. But not all of the conspirators' working hours are devoted directly to revolution. Many of those hours are expended upon subversion of other sorts. William Z. Foster mentions some of these in the chapter which follows. They include: agitating for the release of \"political prisoners\"; demons trating againsl \"imperial- ist war\"; taking control of various nonpolitical disagree- ments and turning them into \"broad class struggles\" having a \"political character\"; defending the Soviet Union, Red China, and other Communist countries; de- manding more and more unemployment insurance; fomenting racial trouble; pushing for higher taxes on the wealthy; insisting upon shorter working hours with pay for a full day's work; pressing for rent reduction; claiming the right for people on relief to operate the relief agency that is supporting them; urging steadily increasing trade with the USSR; calling for larger re- lief payments; trying to force the withdrawal of Amer- ican armed forces from areas of Communist aggression; proposing old-age benefits from the Government; clam- oring for cash payments to farmers; ordering dock workers and longshoremen not to handle military ship- ments; proclaiming solidarity with \"the masses in Latin- America in their fight against American imperialism\"; "},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"4-H NOTES ON CHAPTER 4 opposing the deportation of foreign-born agitators and law violators; struggling to oust Conservatives from all positions of leadership; making \"special demands\" for women in industry, in order to obligate working women to the Communist Party; organizing students in Young Communist groups; resisting the finger-printing of foreign-horn workers; forming \"mass organizations\" (Communist fronts) as needed; combating injunctions and court decisions by \"a policy of mass violation\"; carrying on agitation for \"rights of free speech, free assembly\"; working inside labor unions to split labor from management; striving to elect pro-Communist candidates to public office; creating Communist cells in mines, mills, factories, and other locations; maintain- ing an extensive Parly press; and ranting for the right of US Negroes to set up their own nation in the South's \"Black Belt\". (Communists continued to advocate this \"right\" until 1956, when the Party line softened even further. More recently, how ever, with the coming to power of dictatorial Gus Hall, there have been indica- tions that American Communists again look with favor upon the idea of turning the South over to Negro revolutionaries.) \"In short,\" Foster boasts, \"in every phase of life where capitalist exploitatio n and persecution bear down upon the masses, the Communist party comes forward with . . . demands. . . .\" Remember: the foregoing, too, is only a partial list. It merely represents some of the \"demands\" mentioned by Comrade Foster in his Chapter 4. Small wonder, then, that William Z. Foster makes this arrogant announcement: \". . .

The implications of all th is are clear: to escape the encroaching capitalist starvation and to emanci- pate themselves, the worker s of the world, includ- ing those in this country, must and will take the revolutionary way out of th e crisis.

This is the way the whole capita list world development goes. For the workers, the capitalist way out means deeper enslavement and poverty than ever. The capitalists will neve r voluntarily give up control of society and abdicate their system of ex- ploiting the masses. Regardless of the devastating effects of their decaying capitalism; let there be famine, war, pestilence, terrorism, they will hang on to their wealth and pow er until it is snatched from their hands by the re volutionary proletariat. The capitalists will not give up of their own accord; nor can they be talked, bought or voted out of power. To believe otherwise would be a deadly fatalism, disarming and pa ralyzing the workers in their struggle. No ruling class ever surrendered to a rising subject class without a last ditch open fight. To put an end to the capitalist system will require a consciously revo lutionary act by the great toiling masses, led by the Co mmunist party; that is, the conquest of the Stat e power, the destruction of the State machine create d by the ruling class, and the organization of th e proletarian dictator- ship.

The bourgeoisie resort to every means of violence and terror to safeguard and strengthen its predatory prop- erty and its political domination.

Thus Mr . Hilquit, the million- aire leader of the Socialis t party says: \"In the more democratic countries, especi ally those in which the Socialist and labor moveme nts constitute important political and social factor s, the necessary transi- tional reforms, or at least a large part of them, may be gradually conquered th rough the direct control by the proletariat of important organs of the State, "},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"REVOLUTIONARY WAY OUT OF CRISIS 215 such as municipalities or legislatures, or through the indirect influence of the growing labor move- ment.\" 1 Mr. Hillquit, like So cial Fascists gen- erally, goes on to say th at the present imperialist government is actually th e \"Socialist transitional State, although it would be impossible for us to say just when we entered it.'* We have seen in the previous chapter just what this \"gradualness\" theory of the Social Fascists means in practice — simply the creation of a united front with the capitalists to throw the burden of the crisis upon the workers, to try desperately to save the capitalist system and to crush back the revolution. Nor do es the future hold any better perspective for this theory so far as the workers are concerned. Nowhere in the experience of the world class struggle can any justification he found for the conception that th e capitalists have per- mitted or ever will permit themselves to be shifted from their ruling position without an open strug- gle. On the contrary, the evidence is entirely in the other direction. The capitalist class always brutally uses its armed forces against rebellious workers, meanwhile throwing its democracy and parliamentarism into the waste-basket. What the capitalist class does when it is in a revolutionary situation is conclusively shown by the experience in Italy.

Par- liamentary representatives were expelled or assas- sinated, unions and coope ratives broken up, etc Who but a political illiterate or a plain betrayer of the working class can a ssert that these Italian Fascist capitalist bandits can ever be voted out of power ? The situation in Germany teaches the same les- sons. The German bourgeoi sie, fearing the revo- lution, are developing Fasc ism to drown it in blood.

Or perhaps India and China present valid examples of how the toiling masses can achieve thei r emancipation without struggle? Chang Kai Shek would be especially responsive, mayhap, to parliamentary action by the workers and peasants ? But the history of the American capitalist class offers ample evidence that the toilers can defeat the "},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"REVOLUTIONARY WAY OUT OF CRISIS 217 ruling class only in an open struggle. The Ameri- can bourgeois revolution of 1776, even as the Rus- sian Bolshevik revolutio n of 1917, was carried through on the basis of ar med struggle. This fact the patriotic ladi es of the D.A.R. , fearful of the \"bad\" example set to the rising proletariat, would like to forget. \"American history gives us another example of the same prin ciple when, by the elec- tion of Lincoln, the overwhelming majority voted out of power in the United States government the southern slave holders, th ese slave holders took up arms to maintain their par ticular system of exploi- tation against the will of the majority.\" 2 Nor has the American capitalist class ever hesi- tated to use violence agai nst the toilers whenever its smallest interests were involved. Have we not seen that time and again when workers have struck against actual starvation conditions they have had to face troops, as well as armies of police, gunmen, etc. ? Ludlow, Paint and Cabin creeks in West Virginia, Gastonia, Kent ucky, and i nnumerable other examples of the use of armed force tell their own story. If the capitalists of this country pass so quickly to the use of violence against the work- ers when the latter are ri ghting for the simplest economic demands, what w ill they do when they face a revolutionary situat ion in which their whole system is at stake ?

The es- timated farm population on Jan. 1, 1931, was 27,430,000, a decline of 4,500,000 since 1910. The great masses are poor and getting poorer. The income of the whole group, including the richer farmers, amounts only to about 10% of the total national income of all clas ses in the United States, although the farmers comp rise about 22% of the entire population. Capitalism has nothing to offer the poor farmer except more and more pauperi- zation. An official of the Federal Reserve Bank, quoted in Current Histor y, Mar., 1932, brutally states this as follows: \"O ur farmers should stop buying radios and Ford ca rs and live like peas- ants.\" Talk about collec tivization of the farms under capitalism is Utopian ; this can take place only under a Soviet syst em.

The capitalists try to keep the Negroes isolated by cultivating race pr ejudice among the white workers; but this ca nnot permanently succeed. The white workers will learn that only in the most complete solidarity with the Negro masses can they make headway in de fending their interests. The Negro masses will make the very best fighters for the revolution. The ma nner in which they are turning to the Communist party for organization and leadership constitutes one of the most impor- tant political fa cts in American life. The Negro petty bourgeois leaders are non-plussed by it. In a symposium of 17 non-Communist Negro editors in The Crisis, (April, 1932), a Social Fascist jour- nal, on the issue of Communism among the Ne- groes, W. M. Kelly decl ares: \"the wonder is not that the Negro is beginning, at least, to think along Communistic lines, but that he did not embrace that doctrine en masse long ago.\" "},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"226 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA The revoluti on will not fail to recruit many sup- porters also from the ranks of the lesser city petty bourgeoisie. The advance of capitalism inevitably crushes down into the proletariat great masses of the small tradesmen, petty manufacturers, profes- sionals, intellectua ls, etc., that ma ke up this big class. The steady progress of trustified capital in industry has long since br oken the backbone of the petty bourgeoisie in this field, and now the chain store is ruthlessl y invading its greatest stronghold, retail trade. According to Ray B. Westerfield in Current History, (Dec, 1931), there were in 1930 in the United States 7837 chains of stores with 198,145 uni ts, and the movement is growing like wildfire. This wholesale ruin of the petty bourgeoisie, brought about by the normal development of capitalism, is hastened by the in- dustrial crisis, during which the process of the con- centration of capital pro ceeds faster than ever. Large masses of the petty bourgeoisie are being impoverished. These elements are the natural re- cruiting ground for Fascism, but the Communist party does not su rrender them to the Fascists. Experience, especially in Germany, where the ex- propriation, proletariani zation and even pauperi- zation of the petty bourge oisie has developed to unprecedented degree, show s that great numbers of these people logically become convinced that capitalism holds no hope for them and that only in Communism is there a pros pect for life and happi- "},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"REVOLUTIONARY WAY OUT OF CRISIS 227 ness. The recent significan t mass protest against the proposed Federal sales tax was principally a movement of the discontented petty bourgeoisie. Especially is there a tr end among the petty bour- geois intellectuals towards Communism. This is shown by the many prominen t writers in Europe and the United States w ho in the past few years have declared for Communism. In the past pe- riod American imperialism provided a good living for the intellectuals and professionals generally. Those already carr ying on their active work had easy pickings; those wh o were graduating from the innumerable colleges and universities found soft berths awaiting them . So the American in- telligentsia, almost unanimously, united in a hymn of hundred percentism. Bu t the capitalist crisis has changed all this. Many intellectuals and pro- fessionals now find their means of making a live- lihood either wiped out or drastically curtailed, with consequent heavy drop s in their standards of living. \"A short time a go,\" says The Nation, (Mar. 3, 1932), \"it was re vealed that 45 members of the Detroit Bar Associ ation were on-the-wel- fare — recipients of m unicipal charity.\" It is such conditions of keen co mpetition, inferior re- muneration and actual unemployment that the budding intellectuals still in the schools and col- leges have to face. It is not surprising, therefore, that currents of radicalis m begin to develop among intellectuals generally. Of this the recent student "},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"228 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA strike at Columbia Univ ersity was an example. Even the intellectuals are being compelled to think. At first, in this discont ent there may be strong Fascist or semi-Fascist currents, but eventually much of it will develop in the direction of the revo- lution and Communism. In measuring the pote ntial forces for and against the revolution, na turally the question of the role to be played by the army and navy is one of fundamental importance; for, in the final show- down, it is upon them that the bourgeoisie relies to maintain its control. If it loses the armed forces, then all is lost. Here, certainly, the revo- lution will recruit powerfu l forces, with fatal ef- fects to capitalism. The armed forces are not impervious to Communis m simply because they have patriotic propaganda dinned into their ears and are subjected to a ri gid discipline. The great bulk of these forces orig inate in proletarian or farmer families and they ev entually respond to the sufferings and miseries of their close relatives. Especially is all this true of conscript armies. Be- sides, they have their ow n deep grievances in the service. Experience teach es that such worker- peasant forces are very unreliable for the bour- geoisie. This was exemp lified by the armies of the Czar and the Kaiser in the Russian and Ger- man revolutionary situations. It was only a few months ago that the capita lists of the world got a "},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"REVOLUTIONARY WAY OUT OF CRISIS 229 shiver of fright and a foretaste of the future by the revolts in the Briti sh and Chilean navies. Within these great bloc s of the population — the workers, farmers, Negroes, lesser city petty bourgeoisie — there are suff icient potent ial revolu- tionary forces to put an end to capitalism. They constitute the overwhelming majority of the people. And the deepeni ng capitalist crisis will revolutionize them. The obj ective that the Com- munist party aims at in the mobilization of these forces is the winning of the majority of the work- ing class. With a majority of the workers, which in a revolutionary situati on would necessarily carry along with it large numbers of the other revolu- tionary elements, the Party would be within strik- ing distance of the revolution. But, of course, the Am erican Communist party is only making a beginning in the accomplishment of this great task. Form ed in 1919 by a split-off of the left wing of the So cialist party, it is now laying its foundations among the workers. Al- though the Party is still lagging very much behind the objective possibilities and has by no means mobilized the masses who are ripe for its leader- ship, it is, nevertheless, s ubstantially increasing its membership and influence in all the key industries and localities. The actual strength of the Com- munist movement in the Un ited States is not some- thing that can be accuratel y stated in just so many figures. It has to be measured largely by the gen- "},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"230 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA eral mass influence of the Party and its program. The membership of the Communist party is approximately 15,000. To this should be added 5,000 members in the Yo ung Communist League. These figures represent th e number of dues-payers, the body of Communists who are thoroughly con- scious of the necessity of maintaining a permanent, disciplined Party. But the influence of the Party stretches far and wide beyond the limits of its actual membership. Thus the nine daily papers of the Party have a combin ed circulation of about 200,000. Besides this ther e are 20 weekly, semi- monthly, and monthly pape rs with about 100,000 circulation. This is th e Party press proper. In addition, there are a large number of weekly and monthly papers in the revolutionary unions, de- fense, relief, fraternal and other organizations, with at least another 100,000 circulation. In the 1928 elections, with the Party on the bal- lot in 34 states, it poll ed 48,770 vote s. In the \"off-year,\" 1930, in 18 states it polled 82,651. The Fish committee, in its report, with great alarm pointed out that th ere was an increase of 229% in 16 states. In th e 1931 elections consid- erable increases were scor ed in many localities, two Communist councilmen being elected in Ohio and four in Minnesota. Doubtless, the 1932 national elections will register a la rge increase in the Party vote. But elections, fo r a number of reasons, are "},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"REVOLUTIONARY WAY OUT OF CRISIS 231 not an exact register of the Party strength. For one thing, large numbers of the poorer-paid work- ers, to whom naturally the Party makes the strongest appeal, are disfranchised because of shifts of residence, th rough unemployment, through tax delinquencies and fore ign birth. Also, in a great many cases Communist votes are scornfully ignored by the usual u ltra-reactionary election machines and are not coun ted. Moreover, in the ranks of revolutionary wo rkers there are many who underestimate the great importance of voting in the elections. The real power of the Party is seen in the mass movements which it initiate s itself, or which, ini- tiated by other revolutionary organizations, it gives its full support. The biggest of these are the movements of the unemployed. In the March 6th, 1930, national demonstration for unemploy- ment insurance no less than 1,250,000 workers participated throughout th e country. This huge outpouring was followed in the ensuing months by many large local demons trations, state hunger marches, etc. A demand upon the federal gov- ernment in 1930 for the ad option of the Workers' Unemployment Insurance Bill contained approxi- mately 1,000,000 individu al and collective en- dorsements. The big National Hunger March of December, 1931, put in motion during the many hundreds of local demonstr ations held in connec- tion therewith, at least 1, 000,000 workers. The "},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"232 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA unemployed councils, organi zed under the National Committee of the Unemployed Councils and made up of workers of all political opinions, number at least 75,000 members. The Communist party also exerts a wide and growing influence in the trade union field. Its main support is given to the building of the revolutionary unions of the Trade Union Unity League. It also lays great stress upon the forma- tion of revolutionary mi norities and movements in- side the A.F. of L. unions. During the past several years the revolutionary unions and minori- ties have conducted a numbe r of large mass strug- gles. Among these were the New York cloak (35,000) and fur (12,000) strikes in 1926-7, and the Passaic textile stri ke (15,000) during the same period. In the United Mine Workers of America, in 1926, the left wing candidate polled 101,000 votes, or an actual majority, but was robbed of the election by the corrupt Lewis ma- chine. In the big U.M.W.A. strike of 1927-8 at least 100,000 miners followed the lead of the left wing. The important strike of the Gastonia tex- tile workers in 1929 was conducted by the revolu- tionary National Textile Workers Union. In Lawrence, in Feb., 1931, the N.T.W.U. led a short strike of 10,000. It has since led a dozen smaller strikes in many New England textile towns and played a big role in the strikes later in the year in Paterson and Lawrence. During the Spring "},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"REVOLUTIONARY WAY OUT OF CRISIS 293 and Summer of 1931 the National Miners Union of the TUUL conducted a st rike of 40,000 miners for three months in Western Pennsylvania, East- ern Ohio and Northern West Virginia. At pres- ent it is leading the heroic strike of the Kentucky miners. The foregoing are some of the larger struggles of the revolutio nary union forces. The total membership of the unions of the TUUL is approximately 40, 000, the minorities in the trade unions, less definitely organized, are double or triple that number. In the case of the TUUL unions and minorities, as wi th all the revolutionary organizations, their influe nce over the masses ex- tends far beyond the border s of their actual mem- bership. Among the Negro masses the Communist party is developing a \"wide following. In the unem- ployment campaigns, especially in Chicago and Cleveland, many thousands of Negroes militantly participated. In the 1931 , N.M.U. mine strike more than 6,000 of the strikers were Negroes. The Party leads the fight to defend the nine Scottsboro boys, whom the S outhern capitalists are trying to legally lynch. It is es timated that no less than 1,000,000 , a large percentage of whom were Negroes, took part in the innumerable mass meetings in which this case played a central role. The Negro membership of the Party and the Party's influence among the Negro masses are rap- idly on the increase. "},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"234 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA The Communist party also conducts movements and supports revolutionary organizations in many other mass activities and struggles. It is a strong and leading factor in the fight for the release of political prisoners, includi ng Mooney and Billings, the Kentucky miners, the Centralia and Imperial Valley prisoners, etc. It has organized great dem- onstrations against imperialist war. Among the farmers, the Party carries on considerable work and is gradually laying the basis for a mass or- ganization. The foregoing facts and figures give at least a general idea of the strength of the Communist party at the present stage of the development of the class struggle in th e United States. While they indicate that the Pa rty has only made a start at the mobilization of th e potentially revolutionary forces in the United States , they, at th e same time, sum up into a picture of a Party gradually en- trenching itself among the masses, especially the most exploited sections, and slowly building youth- ful bone and muscle in pr eparation for the gigan- tic revolutionary work that lies ahead. The Communist Party; th e Party of the Toilers T HE C OMMUNIST PARTY is the only Party that rep- resents the interests of these toiling masses of workers, farmers, Negroes, lower city petty bour- geoisie. It alone fights for their welfare now and "},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"REVOLUTIONARY WAY OUT OF CRISIS 235 provides the means for thei r ultimate prosperity and freedom. The other parties and groups — Republican, Democratic, Pr ogressive and Social- ist — are the enemies of th ese classes and the tools of the big capitalists. The Republican party is the party of finance capital, of the great banker s and industrialists of Wall Street, of which th e Morgan interests stand at the head. The Hoover government is the in- strument of these owners and rulers of America. It uses all its power to oppress the producing masses for the benefit of the capitalist exploiters. The present situation, with its economic collapse and hunger and misery for the broad masses, is the logical result of this capitalist policy. From the Republican party no relief, but only a worsen- ing of existing conditi ons may be expected. The Democratic party is no less the party of the big capitalists. Raskob, the dictator of the Demo- cratic party, is notorious ly the representative of the Morgan - Gene ral Motors - D upont interests. The corrupt and reactionary Tammany Hall of New York City is indis tinguishable politically from the rotten Republican Vare machine in Philadelphia. The Democratic party is directly re- sponsible for the unspeakab le regime of lynching, Jim-Crowism and discrimination against the Ne- gro masses in the South, although in this it has the full support of the Repub lican Federal Adminis- tration. Wherever the Democratic party is found "},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"236 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA in power its practical po licies are identical with those of the Republicans and they sura up into a defense of the interests of the capitalists at the expense of the producing masses. In recent years the Democratic party has ever more clearly exposed its big capitalist character. It long ago abandoned its demagogic attacks on the gold standard, impe rialism and the trusts. And then, when the Morgan representative Ras- kob took over the party leadership a few years ago, this was immediately followed by the giving up completely of the old Democratic policy of low tariffs and the adoption of a high tariff policy on the Republican model. The thoroughgoing po- litical unity of th e two capitalist parties was fur- ther emphasized by growing tendencies to link them up organizationally without, however, aban- doning the two-party principl e which is so valuable to the capitalists. This developing organizational unity reached its highest poi nt in the open alliance between the heads of both parties in the present Congress to put across the Hoover-Wall Street program of subsidizing th e great banks, starving the unemployed, cutting the wages of the em- ployed, shifting the tax burden upon the masses, preparing for imperialis t war, etc. All went swimmingly for this two- party machine until it slipped a cog in trying to put across the sales tax. In 1932 elections, the Demo cratic party is sched- uled to play its historical role as the second party "},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"REVOLUTIONARY WAY OUT OF CRISIS 237 of capitalism. Although its basic policies are identical with the Repub lican party, it will make a great show of oppositi on. Large masses of the working class, farmers, Negroes and petty bour- geoisie are deeply discont ented at their impossible conditions under the Hoov er government. There- fore, it is the task of the Democratic party, with a flood of demagogy, to de lude these masses, and to prevent their taking serious steps against the capitalists, by keeping th em fettered with the two capitalist party system. This is the menace of the Roosevelts, Garners, Murra ys, Bakers, etc. They are among the most effect ive instrume nts of the capitalists to enforce upon the producing masses a continuation of the present hunger regime. The Progressive bloc also does not represent the interests of the producin g masses. It represents the rich farmers and certain sections of small capi- talists, and it supports the basic policies of Wall Street. During the pr esent Congress the so- called Progressives supported the elementary pro- posals of the Hoover gove rnment to throw the burden of the crisis upon the producers. Their \"fight\" against the sales tax developed only when, in a broad movement of indignation, many mil- lions of the small farmers, city petty bourgeoisie and workers demanded its rejection. Then, under the lash of Wall Street, th ey fled preci pitately and proceeded, with later taxa tion, to undo the defeat of the sales tax. The only fight th e Progressives "},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"238 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA ever make is for a few cr umbs from the rich man's table. The Progressive leaders, like their reactionary cronies at the head of th e American Federation of Labor, fit themselves co mfortably into the in- famous two-party system . This constitutes a be- trayal of the exploited ma sses into the hands of their capitalist enemies. The \"non-partisan\" pol- icy is not simply an expres sion of political timidity, of hesitation to take th e initiative in forming a new party; it is essentia lly based upon a political unity with the capitalists . We may be sure that if and when, under the pr essure of the masses, a third party is formed, these elements will adopt the familiar devices of the Social Fascists to render it subservient to th e capitalist class. Practice shows that the Progressive policies are antagonistic to the inte rests of the exploited masses. They cultivate in the wors t forms the democratic illusions so esse ntial to capitalist con- trol. For the unemployed the Progressives have produced the typical masterpieces of the massacre in Dearborn, for which Mayor Murphy, as well as Ford, is responsible; and the Wisconsin Groves Law, which, under the name of \"unemployment insurance,\" provides even le ss relief for the unem- ployed than they now receive in many cities under the Hoover charit y-hand-out system. For the em- ployed the Progressives have provided wage-cuts, on the Hoover-Green mode l; example, the maneu- "},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"REVOLUTIONARY WAY OUT OF CRISIS 239 vers of Pinchot in Pennsylvania with the U.M.W. of A. bureaucrats to break the strikes of the min- ers in the Pittsburgh a nd anthracite districts against wage-cuts. As fo r the farmers, the Pro- gressives have kept them thoroughly disorganized by the non-partis an system: the Federal Farm Board, with its wheat and cotton speculation and enrichment of the rural bankers and rich farmers at the expense of the poor farmers, is the fine flower of Progressivism on the farms. Regarding the Negroes, the policies of the Progressives, al- though dressed up in radi cal phraseology, are in practice indistinguishable from those of the ultra- reactionaries: suff icient proof of this being the enthusiastic support given to the candidacy of Gov- ernor Roosevelt, Progressive Mogul, in the most Bourbon sections of the South. Progressivism is a grave danger to the working class. This is because of the widespread existence of petty bourgeois illusi ons among the workers. The LaFollettes, Borahs, La Guardias, Norrises, Pinchots, Murphys, etc., are disorganizers and de- moralizers of the worker s and poor farmers. The Progressive bloc is just another lightning rod to shield the capitalist profit edifice. The Socialist party is th e third party of capi- talism. This is amply de monstrated by its history in the United States and all other countries. The Socialist party has nothing c onstructive to offer the workers in their daily struggles now or for their "},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"240 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA ultimate emancipation. The fact that this party hides its capitalist face be hind a pretense of radi- calism makes it more, not less dangerous. Already we have dealt in considerable detail with the policies and activ ities of the Socialist party. Its advocacy of ca pitalist trustification under slogans of nationalizati on, cultivation of illu- sions regarding \"planned economy\" under capital- ism, support of the Lea gue of Nations, militarist imperialism cloaked with p acifism, alliance with the corrupt leadership of the A.F. of L., policy of putting through wage-cuts by fake strikes, rule of unions by gangsterism, syst ematic slander of the Soviet Union and minimizing of the war danger, etc., is all directly an tagonistic to the working class. That is why the capitalists and their press look with ever more favor u pon the Socialist party. The Norman Thomases are being groomed to play in the United States some day the role of the Mac- Donalds in Great Britain, Boncours in France, Scheidemans in Germany, etc. The wage-cutting, dole-slashing activities of the British Labor party and the German Social Democracy in their attempt to bolster up the decayin g capitalist system pre- sent clearly the perspectiv e for which the Socialist party is being built in this country. The Socialist party all over the world is a main pillar of the capitalist sy stem. Its function is to demoralize the workers' de fense in the face of the "},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"REVOLUTIONARY WAY OUT OF CRISIS 241 capitalist offensive, to break up the workers' counter-offensive against the capitalist system. The Socialist party is a sp ecialized section of the capitalist machinery for exploiting the toiling masses. It is particular ly dangerous in that it takes the workers, just breaking the ideological chains of capitalist slavery, and confuses them with a defense of capitalism unde r the pretense of fight- ing for Socialism. The Socialist party stabs the working class in the back . It, together with its fringe elements of Muste ites, Lovestoneites, Trot- zkyites, etc., has nothing in common with So- cialism. The Present-Dai/ Task s of the American Revolutionary Movement T HE TASKS of the Communist party in a given country at a specified time, in carrying out its pro- gram of class struggle, are, of course, determined by the objective situation and the state of the workers' mood and organi zation. Thus these tasks vary in the several countries, from the building of Socialism in the Soviet Union, open armed war- fare in China, and prep arations for an early revolutionary crisis in Ge rmany, to the most ele- mentary phases of mass education, organization and struggle in the Unite d States, the stronghold of world capitalism. In the United States — a nd this is basic in Com-"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"242 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA munist strategy everywhere — the action program of the Communist party has its starting point in the every-day pressing economic demands of the workers. It is not enough that the Party should propagate its general slogans among the masses and then organize them for the eventual revolu- tion. Such a course, as Lenin so forcefully pointed out in his famous pamphlet, The Infantile Sickness of \"Leftism\" in Communism,, would con- demn the Party to isolation and sectarianism. For the workers the class stru ggle is a never-ending matter of their daily lives; constantly they are confronted with the most urgent necessity to fight against the employers, in de fense of their interests. The Communist party must lead in all these strug- gles. It is in such fights that the wo rkers become class conscious and orga nized around the Com- munist party. Never woul d the masses recognize as their revolutionary Party one that ignored these daily fights and confin ed itself to a high and lofty agitation of re volutionary slogans. It is a favorite slander, however, that the Com- munist party utilizes th e daily struggles of the workers merely for agita tional purposes. Norman Thomas repeats this, sa ying that Communist im- mediate demands are \"designed to be impossible and so to 'show up' the capitalist system.\" 6 But the truth is just the opposite: the Communist party always places as immedi ate demands those mani- 6 America's Way Out, p. 152."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"REVOLUTIONARY WAY OUT OF CRISIS 243 festly possible of achi evement under capitalism and then it makes the most determined effort to win all it can of them in the struggle. This is be- cause the Party has no in terests apart from those of the working class; it also realizes that such vic- tories, instead of destr oying the militancy of the workers, stimulate it. Le nin called such reforms or concessions forced from the employers \"by- products\" of the revolu tionary struggle. The Party understands clearly that the workers logi- cally expect that a Part y which proposes eventu- ally to overthrow the whol e capitalist system should know how to organi ze them to defe nd their inter- ests here and now. As for \"showing up\" capital- ism, this is done by agita tion and propaganda and by the daily experiences of the workers in the class struggle, not by leading th e workers to defeat in strikes and other movements. The Social Fascists try to create the legend that the difference be tween them and the Communists is that while they fight for immediate demands, the Communists confine them selves simply to ulti- mate aims. This is not so . The difference is that while the Communists fight for the immediate de- mands as well as the final goal, the Social Fascists betray both. In the present stage of development of the working class and of the revolutionary struggle in the United States the fight of the workers is essen- tially a defensive struggle against the capitalist "},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"244 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA offensive. On all fronts the employers, with the government in the lead, are worsening the living and working standards of the toilers through wage- cuts, throwing millions of workers into unemploy- ment, seizing the lands of poor farmers, shifting the tax burden onto the pr oducing masses, etc. It is the policy of the Communist party to organize the workers and farmers an d to lead their resist- ance to the capitalist offens ive, to prevent the capi- talists from finding a way ou t of their crisis at the expense and further enslavement of the toiling masses. That is why the Communist party is to be found everywhe re giving its fullest support to all struggles of the workers and poor farmers against the capit alist attack. But the Communist party policy is not simply to organize the defense; it seeks also to transform the workers' defensive struggles into a counter- offensive. It strives to unite the scattered fights of the workers into broa d class struggles and to give them more of a pol itical character. This politicalization becomes th e more urgent with the sharpening offensive of the employers and their increasing use of the Stat e against the workers. The general effects of po liticalizing the workers' struggle are to draw larger masses of workers into the fight, to direct this fight against the State as well as against the employers proper, and thus to strengthen the wo rkers' struggle in every respect. This politicalization is br ought about by the rais-"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"REVOLUTIONARY WAY OUT OF CRISIS 245 ing of political demands which grow out of the very struggle itself, not me rely by the active propa- gation of the ultimate revolutionary program of the Communist party. T hus during a strike de- mands are made for the right to meet, to picket, to strike, for the release of political prisoners, for the adoption, enforcement or repeal of labor leg- islation, against governme nt arbitration, for the withdrawal of troops, etc., and the workers are mobilized in various ways for mass action in sup- port of these demands. In this way, not only are the workers educated to th e class character of the State, but the broadest cl ass front and most mili- tant action is secured in the struggle. In acute conditions of class strugg le this line of strategy- leads to the development of the mass political strike, during which the more fundamental politi- cal demands may be raised. In the question of political demands, as well as of economic demands, the central Communist st rategy always turns around the winning of the immediate struggle in hand. In the present period of intense capitalist offen- sive against the workers, the question of immediate, partial economic demands becomes of decisive importance. The workers have to fight des- perately for the very right to live. Becoming ever more radicalized, they make this fight with constantly sharpening milita ncy. Even the small- est issues readily blaze in to great conflagrations. "},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"246 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA How quickly economic conflicts develop into major political struggles was ev idenced again by the re- cent mutinies in the Br itish and Chil ean navies, both of which began over wage-cuts. It is inter- esting to recall, also, that the mutiny in the Ger- man fleet at the end of the World Wa r, although prepared by the whole cour se of events, actually began in a flare-up of th e men because their ration of soap had been cut off. All of which emphasizes the correctness of the st ress that the Communist party places upon the question of practical partial demands and the necessity of developing the scat- tering economic fights of the workers on to a higher political level. In thus politicalizing the struggle, the Com- munists come into sharpest conflict with the labor reactionaries of the Socialist party and the A.F. of L. type. As part of these misleaders' general policy of choking back the workers' struggles, they seek to keep these fights upon a purely economic basis. They resist all a ttempts of th e workers to militantly fight the State, thus exposing them to the sharp political attack s of the employers. A typical example of this was the surrender of John L. Lewis to the government injunction in the na- tional coal strike of 1920 under the slogan of \"We can't fight the Government.\" Another outstand- ing example of this tr eacherous policy was during the British general strike of 1926. In this great fight, with the bosses us ing every power of the gov- "},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"REVOLUTIONARY WAY OUT OF CRISIS 247 ernment to break the stri ke of the 5,000,000 work- ers, the Social Fascist leaders, eager to find a way to sell out the strike, pu t out the slogan that the struggle was purely an econ omic one and they bit- terly fought every effort to give it a political char- acter. Thus the government was given a free hand and a terrific defeat was suffered by the workers. The Communist Party Program of Immediate Demands T HIS is not the place for a de tailed statement of the program of action of the Communist party. But at least an indication of its general character may be given. As stated before, the Party bases its immediate struggle u pon partial demands cor- responding to the most urgent necessities of the toiling masses. The most important of these de- mands are concentr ated in the Part y's 1932 elec- tion platform, as follows: 1.

The workers can get from the employers only what they have the power to take . The A.F. of L. theory (which corresponds to the Socialist party practice) of the \"harmony of interest between capital and labor\" is the theory of the surre nder of the working class to the bourgeoisie.

This slogan expresses "},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"REVOLUTIONARY WAY OUT OF CRISIS 253 the elementary fighting policy of the revolutionary movement. In applying it, the Communist party actively promotes the mass organization of the workers, regardless of polit ical opinion, into trade unions, unemployed councils, organizations to de- fend the rights of Negr oes, ex-servicemen's leagues, labor defense an d strike relief bodies, leagues of poor farmers, proletarian sports or- ganizations, labor fraterna l insurance societies, organizations to defend th e foreign born, societies of working class culture, et c., etc. Where no mass organizations exist in thes e fields the Party takes the initiative in forming them; where such are al- ready in existence and ar e headed by conservative officials, the Party follow s the policy of building an opposition within th em and fighting for the revolutionary program and leadership. This is the so-called boring-from-within policy. The application of the \"Class Against Class\" policy requires the maki ng of united front move- ments with workers who, while not prepared to accept the whole revolutionary program of the Communist party, nevert heless are willing to struggle for immediate, partial demands. It also means the carrying on of joint struggles with the poor farmers and impoverished sections of the city petty bourgeoisie. But in all such united front movements the aim always is for the workers to lead and for the attack to be directed against the capitalist class and its govern ment. By the use "},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"254 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA of the united front the fi ghting ranks of the work- ers are extended far beyond the limits of the exist- ing revolutionary organizations; the united front bridges the gap between the organized and un- organized workers and li nks them up for common struggle. United front orga ns may take a variety of forms, such as joint strike comm ittees, shop com- mittees, grievance committee s, relief committees, defense committees, etc., being composed in each case of representatives of a ll the unions, A.F. of L. and revolutionary, as we ll as of the unorganized workers in the given situa tion. The united front is organized from the bottom; that is, not with the reactionary leaders of the various labor organiza- tions, but with the ra nk and file workers. The Communist party base s its work directly upon the mills, mines, and factories. Its prin- ciple is to make every shop a fortress for Com- munism. It follows closely the life of the workers in the industries, adapting its immediate program of struggle to their need s. It concentrates its work upon the heavy industr ies and those of a war character. The Party and the revolutionary unions are organized especi ally for this intense shop work. Instead of being based upon terri- torial branches, as is the Socialist party, the Com- munist party has as its basic unit the shop nucleus; the TUUL unions are ba sed upon the shop branch, instead of the craft and ge neral locals of the A.F. of L. type. "},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"REVOLUTIONARY WAY OUT OF CRISIS 255 In carrying out its cla ss struggle program the Communist party practices revolutionary parlia- mentarism. It places cand idates during elections and makes every effort to elect them.

It utilizes the election ca mpaigns to educate the workers and to mobilize th em for every phase of its program on the economic and political fields.

They are enemies within the gates of the working class and must be treated as such. They head the labor movement only in order to behead it. They are a menace an d an obstacle to all struggle by the workers. With their prestige as labor leaders, their demagogy is especially demoral- izing; with their contro l of the workers' mass organizations, they are able to effectively sabotage the struggle. It is idle to try to \"convince\" the Social Fascist leaders or to \"force them to fight by mass pressure,\" because they are class enemies of the workers. They must be politically ob- literated. To accomplish th is is a first condition for successful working clas s struggle and it is one never lost sight of by the Communist party. The Communist party draws a clear line of dis- tinction between the orga nized workers and their Social Fascist leaders. It calls upon the workers to take the control of their struggles into their own hands. The policy of independent leadership "},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"REVOLUTIONARY WAY OUT OF CRISIS 257 by the rank and file workers is fundamental in the general Communist acti on strategy. The Party promotes the formation of the revolutionary oppo- sition in reformist trad e unions; it organizes the workers to oust their reacti onary leaders, to them- selves take over the leader ship of their strikes and other struggles, to break through the cliques of gangsters who control the local unions and sup- press all trade union democracy, to disregard the maze of trade union lega lism that has been built up by the bureaucracy to prevent the development of real struggles. In the trade union field the necessity for inde- pendent rank and file leadership has led to the formation of several inde pendent revolutionary in- dustrial unions in the mini ng, textile, metal, ma- rine, needle and other industries. These are united in a national cente r, the Trade Union Unity League, formed in 1929 through a reorganization of the Trade Union Ed ucational League. The old TUEL was made up solely of revolutionary opposition groups in the reformist unions; the TUUL is composed of both revolutionary opposi- tions and industrial unio ns, with its center of gravity in the latter. Th e formation of the inde- pendent revolutionary un ions was made impera- tive by the systematic sabotage of the struggle by the more and more Fasc ist A.F. of L. leaders through open strike-break ing, suppression of democracy in the unions, mass expulsions, be- "},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"258 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA trayal of the unorganized , etc. The TUUL is not a dual organization in th e sense of the I.W.W. It does not make war upon the A.F. of L. unions as such, but agai nst their reactionary leaders. With the A.F. of L. rank and file the TUUL makes united fronts and conducts joint strike struggles. It organizes a nd supports the work of the A.F. of L. opposition movements. The TUUL revolutionary unions concentrate their attention upon the great masses of unorganized who make up about five-sixths of th e working cl ass, build- ing separate organizations where the fighting spirit of the workers, lack of mass A.F. of L. unions, etc., make this course the most practical one in defense of their intere sts. The TUUL is the American section of th e Red International of Labor Unions. It is made up of workers of all political opinion's. Its relations towards the Com- munist party are those of mutual support and co- operation in the struggle, without organizational affiliation. The Communist party of the United States, in line with its program of cl ass struggle, unites with the revolutionary workers of the world. It is the American section of the Communist International. The Communist Internati onal carries out a united revolutionary policy on a worl d scale, with the nec- essary adaptations for the special conditions in the various countries. The Communist International is a disciplined world party; only such a party can "},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"REVOLUTIONARY WAY OUT OF CRISIS 259 defeat world imperialism. Its leading party, by virtue of its great revolu tionary experience, is the Russian Communist party. In its general work it applies the principles of democratic centralism, even as its affili ated parties do in their respective countries. That is, the policies of the Interna- tional are worked out jo intly with the several parties and then applied in the usual disciplined Communist way. Charges of the Matthew Woll brand that these parties \"take orders from Mos- cow\" are ridiculous. Th e united world revolu- tionary policy of the Communist International differs fundamentally from that of the Socialist Second International, w hose autonomous sections follow the policies of th eir respective national bourgeoisie. It is only with the foregoing Communist prin- ciples and program of cla ss struggle that the work- ers can defeat the efforts of the capitalists to find a way out of the crisis through more unemploy- ment, wage-cuts, and mass starvation, more Fascist terrorism and the unleashing of devastating war.

They confidently assure themselves that, no matter what may happen in other countries, the toili ng masses here will have nothing to do with Socia lism. And, on the surface of things, the workers of the United States are the most conservative of any great industrial country. This is primarily because, living in the land of the most powerful and rapidly rising imperialism, their standards of living have been somewhat higher than those in other countries. Be sides, their class con- sciousness has been greatly hindered by the so- called democratic traditions in the United States, harking back to the days of free land. There has also been a retarding influence in the lack of homo- geneity among the workers—many races, many nationalities, many traditi ons. All of which fac- tors capitalism has thor oughly understood how to exploit in the unparalleled flood of propaganda that it has poured into the workers through the countless newspapers, schools, churches, labor leaders, politicians, radi os, motion pictures, etc. But this conservatism is more apparent than real; it is merely a surface and temporary indica- tion.

In Germany the workers are rapidly becoming revolutionized and in Great Britain they are traveling the same road, if at a somewhat slower tempo. This revolutionization of the workers develops because Germany and Great Britain have been caught deeply in the maelstrom of the general capitalist crisis: Ger- many, crushed by its imperi alist rivals, approaches a revolutionary upheaval; Great Britain, ousted from its position as world industrial leader, slips deeper and deeper into chronic crisis. The erst- while \"conservative\" worker s of these countries, now facing mass starvation, are beginning to see the logic of the situatio n and are gradually pre- paring themselves for the fight to overthrow capi- talism and to establish Socialism. The American workers inev itably must go in the same direction and for th e same reasons, although, for the causes above-mentione d, their pace is as yet much slower.

Especially are the hunger policies of the Hoover government in the unem- ployment question a potent factor in the growing radicalization. The time will come when the capi- talists of this country will realize that one of the greatest mistakes ever made by a ruling class was that of forcing the milli ons of unemployed to go without the necessaries of life while the warehouses were bursting with riches. Under the pressure of the deepening crisis the workers are throwing off their conservatism with a speed and decisiveness that will soon startle the ruling class. The British bourgeoisie were astounded at the recent sudden and significant mass upheavals in St. Johns and Auckland. In Chapter I we have pointed out some of the signs of the new radicalization. But doubtless the proc- ess has gone faster and fart her than the open signs indicate and than even the closest observers realize. The radicalization is la rgely hidden because the American working class, almost completely un- organized industrially an d politically, shamefully Betrayed by the trade uni on leaders and terrorized in the industries, has great obstacles in the way of expressing its discontent.

Besides, it has un- hesitatingly used strike-b reaking methods (among the worst of which were th e fake strikes, or lock- outs in the Socialist-cont rolled needle trades) to defeat the workers who trie d to beat the wage-cuts by struggle. This deadening influence of the A.F. of L. extended far beyond the ranks of its organ- ization into the unorganized industries. The A.F. of L. leadership has been the principal instrument of the bosses to force th e workers to accept lower conditions of living.

The intensification of th e crisis will inevitably bring with it a sharpening and broadening of the class struggle, despite all efforts of the bosses, the government and the A.F, of L.-S.P. leadership to check it.

Or take the case of the Kentucky miners: facing starvation wages, murder ous terrorism by com- pany gunmen and police t hugs, wholesale arrest and railroading of militant workers, flagrant be- trayal by the U.M.W. of A., they turned to the Communist party and the National Miners Union for leadership. These miners, almost without ex- ception, are American-born. They and their for- bears for generations back are of the old pioneer stock. They are intensel y patriotic and religious; race prejudice against th e Negro has been culti- vated amongst them from their earliest childhood. The coal operators, r ealizing these facts and believing that they made the miners immune to revolutionary leadership regardless of their griev- ances, met the advance of the National Miners Union into the Kentucky -Tennessee coal regions with a frantic appeal to the prejudices of the miners. They made it appear that the developing strike was an attempt to overthrow the government, that it meant wiping out religion and the estab- lishment of Negro domination. But the miners stood firm in the face of this unprecedented \"red hysteria\"; the strike we nt on despite all the demagogy and terrorism.

Here are the working drawings for a Soviet America. It is a plan that should shock no one. Yet it is pro- foundly shocking.

In truth, the prospect of armed uprising, savage fighting in the streets, an Amer- ican Red Army suppressing other Americans whose only offense is patriotism, drum-head Communist courts for opponents of the New Order (\". . . an iron fist for counter-revolution,\" Foster puts it), expropriation of property without paying for it, the extermination of whole classes — with, at the end, the firing squad for millions: these anticipated events are presented with surprising restraint. But restraint is only the wrapping. Inside, the ugly fact remains. Reading TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA, many a wishful thinker will fall back upon the tired old phrase, \"It can't happen here.\" And they will be catastrophically wrong. It can happen here.

Then, suddenly and unbelievably, in- ternational Communism was on our doorstep.

He left; and Fidel Castro, Raul Castro, and Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara reigned supreme. Well, not actually supreme; there was still Mo§cow to obey and Peking to follow. . . . But there had been armed and violent revolution, and it had succeeded. Cuba had fall en. A raving Fidel Castro and a deadly dangerous Guevara were giving the orders. And they proceeded to carry out, hardly more than seventy-five miles from US soil, almost exactly the kind of enforced Sovietization that William Z. Foster prom- ises the United States in TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA. Foster's volume might almost have been the hand- book by which Castro came to power in Cuba. A Communist America (Foster calls it the United Soviet States of America) becomes an indescribably horrifying prospect. In the face of what is planned for us, the simple retention of the country's name, with its added \"Soviet\" like some cancerous growth, is a leering and terrible blasphemy. It is vital to remember that everything Foster says in this chapter, as in all of TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA, was said in deadly earnes t. Writing that a Communist slave state would replace our republic, William Z. Foster believed there would be such a state. And though superiors ordered him to repudiate his book, the dis- "},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"5-C NOTES ON CHAPTER 5 avowal nowhere renounced the idea that a Soviet Amer- ica would come to he. Foster only said that, the Com- munist Party's \"tactical li ne\" having changed, the hook was not to be taken as representing the Party's \"present policy\" (1949). He did not say this policy couldn't shift back, overnight, to its former toughness. However, the line did not shift hack so swiftly. Only in the early 1960s did the international Communist position really begin to harden again. No doubt many good folk will be surprised to learn that the Communist policy with which they have been compelled to live, from 1935 onward for nearly twenty- five years, was a \"soft\" on e all the while. It may not have appeared to these Americans that some of the things Stalin said, and Khrushchev said (\"We will bury you,\" for example), were words of conciliation. But by contrast with the kind of thing that is uttered when the Kremlin decides to be really tough, Khrushchev's shoe- pounding and the rest of it are acts of warmest friend- ship. Chapter 5 is the least theo retical, most informative, and most appalling of the Foster book's five major divisions. But while it is the easiest to read, it is the most difficult to read calmly. In fact, for sufferers from high blood-pressure, it is not recommended reading at all. In spite of its cardiac content, this chapter was not written to shock. It was written to convince. The Communist conspirators are great convincers. As a matter of fact, they have done their job so well that the Soviet Union often does not have to do a given thing. Its pitchmen merely have to say it has done that thing, and we believe them.

Or you talk about it as if you have built it. Make no mistake about this: nothing the Kremlin has done in any other field has been half so important, or half so effective, as Soviet achievements in psychological war- fare. In that category is William Z. Foster's TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA. Foster asserted with an air of ab- solute conviction that there would be a Communist USA. And by giving his blueprint the look and feel of a fait accompli, Foster was playing the game. He was building belief, conditioning Americans to think that a Soviet America was as certain to come into being as the sun is sure to rise. \"The American Soviet gove rnment will be organized along the broad lines of the Russian Soviets,\" promises William Z. Foster in Chapter 5. Furthermore, \"The American Soviet government will join with the other Soviet governments in a world Soviet union.\" And, as you would expect, \"The leader of the revolution in all its stages is the Communist party.\" Those are the basic statements upon which the final chapter is built. The rest is detail — stark, abhorrent, sometimes unbelievable, but inevitably part of the ruinous price Americans would pay for a Communist victory. There is not space enough here to describe the Soviet America laid out for us in such gruesome particulars by Comrade Foster. Let it suffice that we permit a few "},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"NOTES ON CHAPTER 5 5-F items to stand proxy for the whole. First, we must assume (with a soul-wrenching shud- der) that Communism has gained control of the United States. It is much less lik ely to happen the way Foster predicted it would — by a mass uprising of workers — than by infiltration, or surrender. However, for our purposes the way it occurs is of far less importance than the fact of its occurrence. Once there is a Soviet America, all else will be academic. During the takeover, the Kremlin expects Americans (\"Capitalists\") to resist, a nd resist desperately. Ac- cordingly, they, and all who do not submit, are to be branded \"counter-revolutionaries\". All counter-revolu- tionaries are to be dragged into temporary courts, Cuba- style, where swift and savage punishment can be meted out for the crime of resisting. Mopping-up operations will be conducted by what Foster calls the Red Guard — an irregular, unofficial force with all the social responsibility of a lynch mob. (Later, when the new regime has an iron grip on the country, the Red Guard will be organized formally into an American Red Army.) Still under the guns of the Red Guard, however, local and regional governmental units will be set up. They will be called \"soviets\". A pretense of electing delegates to these units is to be made . There will, of course, be but one \"party\" and one set of \"candidates\". Only the workers will be allowed to vote; \". . . Citizenship is restricted to those who do us eful work, capitalists, land- lords, clericals and other non-producers being dis- franchised.\" Beginning then with the smallest local units, the Red government will be rigidly organized, step after step, up to the national level. At every level, the appropriate \"soviet\" will exercise complete legislative, executive, "},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"5-G NOTES ON CHAPTER 5 and judicial authority. The national American Soviet government must have a capital. It will not be in Washington, but \"in Chicago, or some other great industrial center.\" The dictatorship of the American proletariat will consist of a Soviet Congress, composed of elected dele- gates (chosen, that is, without opposition, and repre- senting only a single party). The Congress will meet once a year or oftener, and it will confine itself to con- ferring an appearance of legality upon governmental decrees. \". . . Between its meetings the government will he carried on hy a hroad Central Executive Committee, meeting every few months. This C.E.C. will elect a small Presidium and a Council of Commissars, made up of the heads of the various governmental departments, who will carry on the day-to-day work.\" Ahove the national level will come the international organization. There, Soviet countries will be chained together in a worldwide Soviet Union. A brief look at the judiciary in the proposed United Soviet States of America tells us all we need to know about the whole dictatorship—local, regional, national, and international. \". . . The Supreme Court,\" Foster declares, \". . . will be entirely under the control\" of the Central Executive Committee. \". . . The civil and crim- inal codes will be simplified, the aim being to proceed directly and quickly to a correct decision.\" Naturally, in a Communist America th e only ''correct\" decision is a decision that advances world Communism. Lawyers, according to Comrade Foster, will be abol- ished. Then comes the most revealing statement of all: \". . . The courts will he cl ass-courts, definitely war- ring against the class enemies of the toilers.\" They will \"make no hypocrisy like capitalist courts,\" we are told; "},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"NOTES ON CHAPTER 5 5-H there will be no pretense of dispensing impartial justice. When that is said, all is said. For justice, by defini- tion, is impartial. And without justice there is nothing. Chapter 5 contains the lines most often quoted from TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA, even by those who have never seen the book. They quote from each other: \". . . Under the dictatorship all the capitalist parties — Republican, Democratic, Progressive, Socialist, etc. — will be liquidated, the Communist party functioning alone as the party of the toiling masses. Likewise, will be dissolved all other organizations that are political props of the bourgeois rule, including chambers of commerce, employers' associations, rotary clubs, Amer- ican Legion, Y.M.C.A., and such fraternal orders as the Masons, Odd Fellows, Elks, Knights of Columbus, etc.\" Dozens of equally ominous paragraphs from this chapter might be cited. But they can be read for them- selves — and more profitably, too; for reading them in Chapter 5 puts them in their proper context. A few, nonetheless, stand out by their very grotesqueness. For instance, this: \". . . There will be no place for the present narrow patriotism, the bigoted nati onalist chauvinism, that serves so well the capitalist war-makers.\" Or this, about the American woman under Commu- nism : \". . . On all sides she confronts mediaeval sex taboos, assiduously cultivated by the church, State and bourgeois moralists . . . . The free American woman, like her Russian sister, will eventually scorn the whole fabric of bourgeois sex hyprocrisy and prudery.\" Or this: \". . . Freedom will be established for anti-"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"5-1 NOTES ON CHAPTER 5 religious propaganda. . . . God will he banished from the laboratories as well as from the schools.\" And, finally, this from atheis t Foster: \". . . not Chris- tianity but Communism will bring peace on earth.\" To read TOWARD SOVIET AM ERICA is to look into— what? The future? No. Despite all of Marxism's claims about having discovered immutable laws which govern not merely past and present but the millennia ahead, no one, not even a dues-paid Communist, can foretell the future. What William Z. Foster describes is not the future. It is only a wish concerning the future. Foster tells us what Communism wants. Bu t Communism, by itself, does not possess the power to earn or to take what it wants. Only we who are outside Communism, outside it and above it, can give Moscow its wish. Only we can permit the coming of a United Soviet States of America. And if by our apathy we are given the ability to put our country into the Kremlin's clutch, by an equal vigilance, an equal determination, we can keep the country free. It is not for Communism to say what shall happen to us. It is for us to say. A look into TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA is not a look into the years ahead. It is a look into the past. Com- munism is not progress, but regression. It is a step backward across the centuries, backward across years counted in the hundreds of thousands, to the primordial struggle for the merest existence, the law of the lawless, "},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"NOTES ON CHAPTER 5 5-J the rule of force, the gnawing of the bone.

Its parliamentary democracy, rampant patriotism, robot-like education of th e masses, reformist trade unionism, etc., fitted naturally into the capitalist scheme of things everywhere. By the same principle, the Soviet Union now forecasts the general outlin es of the new social order that the world is approaching. The Soviet system was not an inventi on.

It foreshadows the broad lines along which the future Soviet America will develop. Here our ta sk is not to work out all the details of an Amer ican Soviet system, as that would exceed the scop e of this book, but to trace out, upon the basis of actual experience to date, the general structure and workings of such a regime. From capitalism to Co mmunism, through the intermediary stage of Soci alism; that is the way American society, like soci ety in general, is headed. It represents the main lin e of march of the human race to the next higher social stage in its historical advance. It is the trend to which all the economic, political and social forces of today are contributing. The American revolution, when the workers have finally seized pow er, will develop ev en more swiftly in all its phases than ha s the Russian revolution. This is because in the Un ited States objective con- ditions are more ripe for revolution than they were in old Russia. In his work, Imperialism, Lenin states: \"Capitalism, in its imperia list phase, arrives at the threshold of the complete socialization of production. To some extent it causes the capitalists, whether they like it or no, to enter a new social order, which marks the transition from free competition to the socialization of production. Production becomes social, but appro- "},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"270 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA priation remains private. The social means of produc- tion remain the private property of a few.\" This means that in such a highly-industrialized country as the United States the industrial base for Socialism is already at hand. The great problem before the workers is to get the political power. The Russian workers, however, not only had to conquer power but also to build a great industrial system. At the Eighth C ongress of Soviets, in 1920, Lenin declared that , \"Communism is the Soviet power plus the electrification of the coun- try.\" In the United Stat es, the problem of the American working class in achieving Socialism may be summed up, as Browder has put it, as the present American industrial technique plus Soviets. Besides this more favorable industrial base, American workers, once in control, will have other advantages which will greatly speed the tempo of revolutionary deve lopment. These are, first, the vast experience accumulated in the Russian revolu- tion, and, second, the prac tical assistance of the Soviet governments existing at the time of the American revolution. Th ese are enormous ad- vantages. As for the Russi an workers, they were pioneers blazing the revolu tionary trail. They had to work out for themselves a maze of unique problems and to struggle against a whole hostile capitalist world. The sum of all which is that the period of transition from capitalism to Socialism "},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"UNITED SOVIET STATES OF AMERICA 271 in the United Soviet Stat es will be much shorter and easier than in the U.S.S.R. The American Soviet Government W HEN the American working class actively enters the revolutionary path of abolishing capitalism it will orientate upon the building of Soviets, not upon the adaptation of th e existing capitalist gov- ernment. Capitalist govern ments have nothing in common with proletarian governments. They are especially constructed th roughout to ma intain the rulership of the bourgeoisi e. In the revolutionary struggle they are smashed and Soviet governments established, built according to the requirements of the toiling masses. The building of Soviets is begun not after the revolution but before. When the eventual revolu- tionary crisis becomes acu te the workers begin the establishment of Soviets. The Soviets are not only the foundation of the future Workers' State, but also the main instrument s to mobilize the masses for revolutionary struggle . The decisions of the Soviets are enfor ced by the armed Red Guard of the workers and peasants an d by the direct seizure of the industry through factory committees. A revolutionary American working class will follow this general course, which is the way of proletarian revolution. The American Soviet government will be or-"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"272 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA ganized along the broad lines of the Russian Soviets. Local Soviets, the base of the whole Soviet State, will be established in all cities, towns and villages. Local Soviets combine in themselves the legislative, executive and judicial functions. Representation, based on occupation instead of residence and property, comes directly from the shops, mines, farms, schools, workers' organiza- tions, army, navy, etc. The principle of recall of representatives applies throughout. Citizenship is restricted to those who do useful work, capital- ists, landlords, clericals and other non-producers being disfranchised. The local Soviets will be combined by direct rep- resentation into county, stat e, and national Soviets. The national Soviet government, with its capital in Chicago or some other great industrial center, will consist of a Soviet Congress, made up of local dele- gates and meeting annually, or as often as need be, to work out the general policies of the govern- ment. Between its meetings the government will be carried on by a broad Central Executive Com- mittee, meeting every few months. This C.E.C. will elect a small Presidium and a Council of Commissars, made up of the heads of the various government departments, who will carry on the day-to-day work. The American Soviet government will join with the other Soviet governments in a world Soviet Union. There will also be, very probably, some "},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"UNITED SOVIET STATES OF AMERICA 273 form of continental union. The American revolu- tion will doubtless carry with it all those countries of the three Americas th at have not previously accomplished the revolution. The Soviet court system will be simple, speedy and direct. The judges, chosen by the corre- sponding Soviets, will be responsible to them. The Supreme Court, instead of being dictatorial and virtually legislative, as in the United States, will be purely juridical and entirely under the con- trol of the C.E.C. The civil and criminal codes will be simplified, the aim being to proceed directly and quickly to a correct decision. In the acute stages of the revolutionary struggle special courts to fight the counter-revol ution will pr obably be necessary. The pest of la wyers will be abolished. The courts will be class-c ourts, definitely warring against the class enemies of the toilers. They will make no hypocrisy like cap italist courts, which, while pretending to deal out equal justice to all classes, in reality are in struments of the capitalist State for the repression and exploitation of the toiling masses. The American Soviet government will be the dictatorship of the prolet ariat. In Chapter II we explained this dictatorsh ip as the revolutionary government of the workers and toiling farmers. In the proletarian dictator ship the working class is the leader by virtue of its revolutionary program, superior organization and gr eater numbers. To- "},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"274 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA wards the farmers, the a ttitude of the government will vary from an open alliance with the poor farm- ers and cooperation with the middle farmers, to open hostility ag ainst the big, exploiting land- owners. Towards the city intelligentsia and petty bourgeoisie generally, its attitude will be one of friendliness and cooperation, insofar as these ele- ments break with the old order and support the new. The new Workers' government, as part of its task of building Social ism, necessarily will have to hold firmly in check the counter-revolutionary elements who seek to ov erthrow or sabotage the new regime. To suppose that the powerful American capitalist class and its vast numbers of hangers-on will tamely subm it to the loss of their power to the work ers would be to ignore the whole history of that class. Th e mildness or severity of the repressive measures us ed by the workers to liq- uidate this class political ly will depend directly upon the character of th e latter's resistance. While the whole trend of the revoluti onary work- ers is against violence, th ey always have an iron fist for counter-revolution. In order to defeat the cl ass enemies of the revo- lution, the counter-revoluti onary intrigues within the United States and the attacks of foreign capi- talist countries from withou t, the proletarian dic- tatorship must be supported by the organized armed might of the workers, soldiers, local militia, etc. In the early stag es of the revolution, even "},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"UNITED SOVIET STATES OF AMERICA 275 before the seizure of po wer, the workers will or- ganize the Red Guard. Later on this loosely con- structed body becomes develo ped into a firmly-knit, well-disciplined Red Army. The leader of the revoluti on in all its stages is the Communist party. With its main base among the industrial work ers, the Party makes a bloc with the revolutionary farmers and impoverished city petty bourgeoisie, drawing under its general lead- ership such revolutionary groups and organizations as these classes may have. Under the dictatorship all the capitalist partie s — Republican, Democratic, Progressive, Socialist, etc. — will be liquidated, the Communist party functioni ng alone as the Party of the toiling masses. Likewise, will be dissolved all other organiza tions that are political props of the bourgeois rule , including chambers of com- merce, employers' associ ations, rotary clubs, American Legion, Y.M.C.

The whole pur- pose of such a government will be to advance the welfare of those who do us eful work. This is not the case with the present government of the United States. It is dominated by the Morgans, Mellons and other big bank ers and industrialists. Its func- tion is to protect the interests of the capitalist "},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"276 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA class — in first line finance capital — at the ex- pense of the working masses. Every piece of legislation, every strike , every demonstration of the unemployed illustrate s this afresh. In no matter what field, wherever the interests of the workers are involved, they find the powers of the government arrayed agai nst them. The Ameri- can government is as mu ch the property of the capitalists as their mills, mines, factories and land. Only a Soviet governmen t can and will represent the will of the workers. The establishment of an American Soviet gov- ernment will mark the birth of real democracy in the United States. For th e first time the toilers will be free, with industry and the government in their own hands. Now th ey are enslaved: the industries and the governme nt are the property of the ruling class. The right to vote and all the cur- rent talk about democracy are only so many screens to hide the capitalist autocr acy and to make it more palatable to the masses. Consider the economic and political gulf between the Southern textile workers slaving for $5 a w eek and the rich South- ern capitalists; between the hungry unemployed workers in the Northern cities and the fat capital- ist parasite masters lolling the Winters through at Palm Beach; between the semi-slave Negroes in the South and their expl oiters; between the out- rageous treatment visite d upon Mooney and Bill- ings, Sacco and Vanzetti and many other class war "},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"UNITED SOVIET STATES OF AMERICA 277 prisoners and the protec tion given to the Falls, Daughertys and the whole clique of capitalist rob- bers of the poor — then one gets the true measure of the American capitalist \"democracy\" and \"free- dom.\" Ambassador Gerard blurted out the truth that the American governm ent is a capitalist dic- tatorship when he declar ed that 59 bankers and captains of industry are the real rulers of the United States. The Expropriation of the Expropriators \"The victorious proletariat utilizes the conquest of power as a lever of economic revolution, i.e., the revolu- tionary transformation of the property relations of capi- talism into relations of the Socialist mode of production. The starting point of this great economic revolution is the expropriation of the landl ords and capitalists, i.e., the conversion of the monopolistic property of the bour- geoisie into the property of the proletarian State.\" 1 After providing for the emergency defense and provisioning requirements, the first steps of an American Workers' and Farmers' government, which is the dictatorship of the proletaria t, will be directed towards the revo lutionary nationalization or socialization of the large privately-owned and State capitalist undertakings. In industry, transport and communication this will mean the immediate taking over by the State of all large factories, mines and power plants, 1 Program of the Communist International."},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"278 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA together with all munici pal and State industries; the whole transport services of railroads, water- ways, airways, electric car lines, bus lines, etc.; the entire communication orga nization, including tele- graphs, telephones, post office, radio, etc. In agriculture it will invo lve the early confisca- tion of the large landed estates in town and country, including church property, together with their buildings, factories, live stock, etc., and also the whole body of forests, mineral deposits, lakes, rivers, etc. In finance it will mean the nationalization of the banking system and its concentration around a central State bank; the taking over of the depart- ment stores, chain stores, and other large wholesale and retail trading organi zations; the setting up of a State monopoly of fo reign trade; the cancel- lation of all government debts, reparations, war loans, etc., to the big fo reign and home capitalists. The socialization program will be carried through on the basis of c onfiscation without re- muneration, except for sp ecial consideration to small investors. Such a program naturally evokes loud protest from capitalis ts and the defenders of private property, especial ly the Social Fascists. The latter's idea, again expressed by Norman Thomas in his book, Amer ica's Way Out, is for the workers to buy the i ndustries and land from their capitalist owners. Thomas even proposes the absurd plan that , through holding companies, the "},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"UNITED SOVIET STATES OF AMERICA 279 workers can secure contro l with a minority of the stock. Such Social Fascist pr oposals have nothing in common with Socialism. They represent a defi- nite support of the capita list class and the land- lords in their claims for the right to exploit the workers; they seek to conserve the dominant position of these classe s in a new form, State capitalism. The workers will never buy out the capitalists, nor could they if they would. There is no warrant in common-se nse or historical prece- dent for the workers to buy the industries and natu- ral resources from the pr esent ruling class. In confiscating this property of the big landlords and capitalists, the work ers and poor farmers will sim- ply be taking back that which has been ruthlessly stolen from them. This lesson of expropriation without compensation by a revolutionary class has been amply taught in the British, French, Russian and many other revolutions. The revolutionary American colonists did not compensate the British landlords; the Northern capitalists did not pay the Southern planters when they transformed the Negro chattel slaves into wage slaves; and the working class will follow th e same course of revo- lutionary confiscation. The socialization of the ke y sections of industry, commerce, agriculture and finance will lay a solid economic foundation for the building of Socialism. Doubtless, private property will survive in small "},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"280 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA farms, in petty industry and in trade. But this will be only temporary. With the consolidation and growth of Socialism a nd the general spread of well-being all the land will eventually and without serious difficulty be na tionalized, and all industry will be concentrated into the Socialist Soviet economy. The Improvement of the Toilers' Conditions T HE CENTRAL purpose of the revolut ion is to con- quer political power fo r the workers and to fundamentally improve th e economic and social conditions of the produci ng masses. Immediately an American Soviet governme nt is established, the shut-down factories will be opened. Production will be started to relieve the impoverished work- ers and farmers. The great stores of necessities, now piled up and unsaleable, will be released to the masses. The unemploy ed will be fed, housed and given work. Pending any delay in putting the industries into full opera tion, the unemployed will be paid social insurance on the basis of full wages. The general policy of the Soviet government will be to at once put into effe ct at least the immediate demands that the workers are now demanding of capitalism, and which we have discussed in the pre- vious chapter. Wages will be sharply ra ised, espe- cially for the lower-paid cat egories; then there will be established the 7-hour day or, very probably, "},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"UNITED SOVIET STATES OF AMERICA 281 less, with a correspondingl y still shorter workday for young workers and those engaged in dangerous occupations; there will also be the development of the system of social in surance against unemploy- ment, old age, sickness, accidents, etc., on a full wage basis; the aboliti on of the many discrimina- tions against Negroes, wo men, and young workers in industry; the establishment of free medical services, vacations for workers, etc. The Soviet government will initiate at once a vast housing program. All houses and other buildings will be socialized. The great hotels, apartments, city palaces, country homes, country clubs, etc., of the rich will be taken over and utilized by the workers for dwellings, rest homes, chil- dren's clubs, sanatoria, et c. The best of the sky- scrapers, emptied of thei r thousand and one brands of parasites, will be used to house the new government institutions, th e trade unions, coopera- tives, Communist party, et c. The fleets of auto- mobiles and steam yachts of the rich will be placed at the disposition of the workers' organizations. A great drive will be made to demolish the present collection of miserable shacks and tenements and build homes fit for th e workers to live in. The Soviet government wi ll immediately free the poor farmers from the oner ous burdens of mort- gages and other debts wh ich now hold them in slavery. Of the total income of all farmers in "},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"282 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA 1927, 17% went for loans and mortgages. 2 Land rent will be abol ished, both in the form of cash and share-crops. The land will be to the users. The present monopolistic pric es for agricultural ma- chinery, fertilizer, etc., will be drastically cut. Taxes will be slashed and shifted off the backs of the poor farmers. For the millions of \"one-horse\" farmers now living at the verge of starvation in many states, more land will be allotted; they will also be furnished with th e necessary seed, machin- ery, fertilizer and expert instruction. Food and other necessities of life wi ll be given to those in need. Production of foodstu ffs will not be cur- tailed, but greatly stimulated. Such a program is not a ma tter of mere specula- tion. This is the line that developed in the Soviet Union and it is the one that will develop here. Even in the face of their gigantic tasks, the neces- sity to build industry from the ground up in the teeth of world capitalist opposition, the Russians, as we have seen in Chapter II, have been able vastly to improve the conditions of the toilers of factory and farm. In th e United States, however, the revolution, because of the superior industrial equipment here, will be ab le to advance the Amer- ican workers' standards of living much more quickly and drastically. It will also make it pos- sible to lend assistance to the more undeveloped countries. It is true that the powerful and ruth- 2 Recent Economic Changes, Vol. II, p. 784."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"UNITED SOVIET STATES OF AMERICA 283 less American capitalist cl ass will seek to prevent all this by destroying the industries during the revolution, which only em phasizes the need for breaking their resistance the sooner. The above measures of improvemen t for the workers and farmers will re present only a bare be- ginning. Already the mate rial conditions are at hand in the United States fo r an enormous increase in the well-being of the masses. The barriers to this advancement are th e incredible robberies, wastes and the general id iocies of the capitalist system. The revolution will clear away this mass of exploitation, inefficien cy and reaction, and will open the road fo r such an industrial development and general rise in material and cultural standards of the masses as now s eems only the stuff of dreams. The Liquidation of Ca pitalist Robbery and Waste T HE REVOLUTION will put a stop to the whole series of capitalist leaks, wastes and thieveries which now prevent the rise in standa rds of the masses. It is the marvel of the capital ist world how the Soviet government, with virtually no foreign credits, manages to raise the many billions necessary to finance the Five-Year Plan. The explanation is to be found in th e gigantic economi es inherent in the Socialist system as against the inefficiencies and "},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"284, TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA grafts of capitalism. Th ese economies will be much greater in the United Soviet States of America. First of all, the American Soviet government, by taking over the owners hip of industry and the land, will put a sudden stop to the manifold forms of robbing the workers and farmers of monster masses of value on the ba sis of private ownership of the social means of livelihood. All forms of capitalist interest, rent and profit will be abol- ished. Capitalists, mortgage holders, landowners and coupon clippers perf orm no useful function in society. Their rake-off from industry and the land is sheer robbery. This is one of the great les- sons of the Russian revolu tion. They are a deadly detriment. The first re quirement for further social progress is to abolish this class of parasites. Veblen states the case very mildly when he says that \"the capitalist financier has come to be no better than an idle wheel in the economic mecha- nism, serving only to take up some of the lubri- cant.\" 3 In reality, the ca pitalists, with their program of mass poverty, ex ploitation and war, are a menace to the human race. Ending the gigantic robbery which is the very base of the capitalist syst em will at once release vast values for useful social ends. How vast may be realized from the fact that in 1928 the total national income in the Un ited States was approxi- 3 The Price System and the Engineers, P. C6."},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"UNITED SOVIET STATES OF AMERICA 285 mately 90 billion dollars, of which, it is estimated by Varga that no less than 46% was taken by capi- talist exploiters in the sh ape of corporation profits, ground rents, interest on mortgages, official sala- ries and bonuses, etc. An American Soviet gov- ernment, stopping this monstrous expropriation of the toilers, will turn thes e great sums to the im- provement of the living and cultural standards of the producing masses. Secondly, the setting up of a Socialist system will greatly increase the productive forc es and pro- duction itself. By liquid ating the contradiction between the mode s of production and exchange, it does away with economic cr ises, with all their waste and loss. Where there is no capitalist class to de- mand its profit before production and distribution take place, and where th e producers as a whole receive the full product of their labor, there can be no economic over-produc tion and crisis. Con- sequently, unemployment, w ith its terrible misery and suffering, will become a thing of the past. The many millions who now walk the streets un- employed will have fruitful work to do, to the bene- fit of all society. With the deadly limitations of the capitalist market rem oved, the road will be opened to virtually unlim ited expansion of indus- try and mass consumption. Thirdly, Socialism will result in an enormous increase in industrial and agricultural efficiency. It is the proud boast of the capitalists, particu- "},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"286 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA larly the Americans, that their system represents the acme of economy and efficiency. But this is so untrue as to be grot esque. The Socialist sys- tem of planned product ion, based upon social ownership of industry and the land, is incompara- bly more efficient than th e anarchic capitalist sys- tem founded upon private property, competition and the exploitation of the workers. In his book, The Tragedy of Waste, Stuart Chase estimates that of the 40,000,000 \"gai nfully employed\" in the United States about 20, 500,000, or 50%, waste their labor totally. Recently Iron Age stated that by putting all the industrial plants in the United Stages on the basis of modern technique it would be possible to shorten the working day to one-third of the present, while at the same time doubling the output. Socialism wi ll wipe out these great wastes, inherent in the pl anless, competitive capital- ist system. It will liquidate the hundreds of use- less and parasitic occupati ons, such as wholesalers, jobbers, and the entire crew of \"middlemen,\" real estate sharks, stock brok ers, prohibition agents, bootleggers, advertising specia lists, traveling sales- men, lawyers, whole raft s of government bureau- crats, police, clericals, and sundry capitalist quacks, fakers, and grafters. It will turn to useful social purposes the immense valu es consumed by these socially useless elements. Socialism will also cons erve the natural re- sources of the country which are now being ruth- "},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"UNITED SOVIET STATES OF AMERICA 287 lessly wasted in the mad capitalist race for profits. Chase points out, among ma ny examples of such criminal waste, that by wrong production methods 16 billion barrels of petr oleum have been lost; every year 5 billion feet of lumber are likewise wasted; and although as ye t only 2% of the total coal in this country has been mined, 33% of the best beds has been gutte d. Natural gas and the various minerals are be ing similarly wasted. A Soviet government will, of course, put a stop to this criminal recklessness and have as one of its principal aims the careful conservation of all the natural resources. Finally, the eventual vict ory of the workers on a world scale will liquidate the monster, War, with all its agonies and social losses. The ghastly bill of the World War comprise d, in terms of human life, 12,990,000 dead and a to tal casualty list of 33,288,000, not counting th e thirty millions more who died in various c ountries from famine and pestilence as a result of th e war. The direct prop- erty loss and general fina ncial cost of the war is estimated at 340 billion dollars. It is along these broad channels that the Amer- ican Soviet government w ill find the means for the early and far-reaching improvement of the toilers' standards. The abolition of the monumental rob- bery of the workers by th e capitalists in all its myriad forms; the liquida tion of the capitalist eco- nomic crisis, with it s mass unemployment and "},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"288 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA general crippling of the productive forces; the de- velopment of an industria l efficiency and a volume of production now hardly dreamed of; the careful conservation of natural re sources; the abolition of war; — these revolutionary measures will provide the material bases for a well-being of the toiling masses of field and fact ory now quite unknown in the world. The Reorganization of Industry A MONG the first tasks of the American Soviet government will be the reorganization of the chaotic capitalist industri es upon Socialist lines. To do this the banks will all be centralized in one great system. The railroads will be completely consolidated; duplicate line s will be eliminated; bus, truck, airplane, interu rban electric and steam- ship lines will be scientif ically coordinated with the railroads, thereby making a saving of at least 50% in transportation efficiency. The scattered units of the other industries will be similarly organized, with an even tual program of rebuilding industry into larger units, regroup ing of plants at more strategic points, elimina tion of small and uneco- nomic plants, etc. The industrial system as a whole will be headed by a body analogous to the Supreme Economic Council of the U.S.S.R. The S.E.C. is made up of a series of \"united industries,\" \"trusts,\" and "},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"UNITED SOVIET STATES OF AMERICA 289 \"combines.\" There is th e necessary sub-division for the special char acter of the industry, local con- ditions, etc. Each industri al unit, with an estab- lished budget and allocated capital and credit, operates upon the principl es of cost accountancy and individual an d collective resp onsibility. The whole industrial apparatus — production, distri- bution, financing — while each part retains the necessary organization, sp ecialization and initiative required for the fulfillment for its particular func- tions, constitutes a great industrial machine, each cog of which fits into an d works harmoniously with the rest. The superiority of such an organized Socialist industry over the present piece-meal and anarchic American industrial system is evident at a glance. Compare this scientific i ndustrial organization, as a coordinated and coopera ting whole, with the present maze of 206,556 se parate American manu- facturing concerns, incl uding coal mi ning 6,000; textiles (cotton, wool, silk, rayon) 5,833; metal (main branches) 23,000, etc., 4 not to speak of the hundreds of thousands of separate retailing, job- bing and financing concerns. And all these mul- titudinous units are engaged in a dog-eat-dog competition with each ot her, blindly producing and throwing their products aimlessly into the markets. Socialist industry means sy stem, cooperation, effi- 4 Figures based on U. S. Department of Commerce Census Bul- letin, Dec. 31, 1930. "},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"290 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA ciency; capitalist industry m eans chaos, conflict, waste. Naturally, American Socialist industry will be operated upon the basis of a planned economy. The aim of the whole indus trial machine will be to achieve the highest possibl e standards for the pro- ducing masses, not the welf are of a few capital- ists. Production will be scie ntifically calculated in advance. The needs of th e people and the possi- bilities of the industries will be carefully studied and met. With a thoroughly organized industrial system the carrying out of the production plans will be easy and natura l. A Socialist society without a planned economy is unthinkable, even as it is unthinkable that a capitalist society should work on the basis of scientific planning. Under the American Soviet government with such an organized indus trial system, economic crises, clogging of the markets through over-pro- duction, cannot take place. The toilers as a whole receiving the values they produce and there being no parasitic capitalists whos e special class interests have to be preserved, ga ins in production will ex- press themselves automati cally and immediately in higher wages, shorter work ing hours and generally improved conditio ns. In a Soviet America there could not possibly exist the present hideous anom- aly of millions of worker s and their families unem- ployed and starvi ng while the mark ets are glutted "},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"UNITED SOVIET STATES OF AMERICA 291 with commodities and th e great industries stand idle. The operation of Socialist nationalized industry is, of course, not to be compared with government- operated industry under capitalism. This is be- cause the capitalists, fe aring to endanger their beloved system of privat e ownership, always see to it that industries opera ted by their governments are thoroughly sabotaged, mismanaged and gen- erally discredited. But under Socialism the whole interest of the government is to manage the indus- tries efficiently and to eliminate bureaucratism, and this is done to a de gree quite unkno wn in the capitalist world. In Socialist society the trade unions play a fun- damental role. They are a gigantic factor in the Soviet Union. They draw the masses directly into the work of Socialist cons truction, in the building of the new society. They attend to the protection of the immediate needs of the workers. They con- stitute the mass basis for the Soviets. They are the great schools for Communism. No important activities are embarked u pon without their consent and cooperation. No labor law can go into effect without their endorsement. Their representatives occupy key positions in every stage of the eco- nomic, political and social organization. Com- pared to these great mass bodies, the American Federation of Labor, whic h presumes to sneer at "},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"292 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA the Russian unions, plays an insignificant role in the life of the working class. The Russian trade unions base their organiza- tion directly upon the industries through shop com- mittees. Their general st ructure follows the lines of the economic organization of their industries. There are 45 national i ndustrial unions in the U.S.S.R. They are not St ate organs, being based entirely upon the principl es of voluntary member- ship. The trade unions look af ter the formulation and enforcement of the whole elaborate body of social insurance (unemployment, sickness, old age, ma- ternity, accident, etc.). They enforce the gov- ernment sanitary and sa fety regulations. And especially they work out the wage scales jointly with the government economic organs. This is not a matter for strikes an d struggles, there being no ruling, owning class to contend with; it is a question of amicable ar rangement upon the scien- tific basis of the genera l returns from industry and agriculture, taking into account the needs for the further expansion of indu stry, the upkeep of the government, etc. In industry the trade unions perform a very important part. But they do not of themselves actually lead the production, this being the task of the government economi c organs, with close local and national supervision from the Party and the unions. The Syndica list theory that the trade "},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"UNITED SOVIET STATES OF AMERICA 293 unions could directly carry on production is one of the many theories that were proven false by the actual practice in the Russian revolution. The unions, locally and nationa lly, hold periodic pro- duction conferences with th e technical heads of the industries, hearing reports from them and checking up on their work. They have representatives in all the higher economic organs, as well as in the Soviets proper. The trad e unions are the very basis of the vast mobilization of the working class in the industries for the carrying through of the Five-Year Plan. The trade unions are also a vital means in the education of the masses. They have a great net- work of factory schools, newspapers, libraries and theatres. They have thousands of rest homes, clubs, sanatoria, hospitals, gymnasiums, etc. They swell in many directions the great wave of en- lightenment, organizati on and prosperity among the toilers. In building Socialism in this country the trade unions will play essentially the same role as in the U.S.S.R. The revolutionar y unions of the Trade Union Unity League are th e nucleus of the even- tual great labor organizati ons of Soviet America. Whatever remnants of the present A.F. of L. may exist at the time of the revolution will be merged into the series of industrial unions based on all- inclusive factory committ ees. The revolutionary workers, both before and during the revolutionary "},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"294 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA crisis, will ruthlessly drive from office the reac- tionary A.F. of L. leaders as the most servile and dangerous of all tools of the bourgeoisie. The cooperatives are also a foundation stone in the Socialist economic system. The cooperatives form the great retail distributing mechanism; they are directly connected with the factories, thus cut- ting out all useless and parasitic middlemen. En- tering into every city and village, they constitute a gigantic distributing agency, beside which even the biggest American chain stores and mail order houses are only small potatoes. The cooperatives also play a very important role in production, espe- cially in agriculture. The tremendous collective farm movement in the U.S.S.R. represents the co- operative grown to revolutionary maturity. As in the case of the American trade unions, the existing cooperatives in this country will have to be profoundly reorga nized and rebuilt to per- form their new tasks. They will be developed from the skeleton organizations they are today into a gigantic mass movement. This will be one of the first and most urgent tasks of a revolutionary American government. In building Socialist industry the greatest prob- lem the workers will have to solve, as the Russian experience shows, is to secure mastery over indus- trial technique. Although the great industrial base will be on hand, desp ite capitalist efforts to destroy it in the revolutionary struggle, there will "},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"UNITED SOVIET STATES OF AMERICA 295 remain the task of giving the industries Socialist form and leadership. It w ill be impossible to take over, as is, the capitalist economic organs and per- sonnel and start them off running as Socialist institutions. But in the United States this problem of devel- oping the new Socialist forms and cadres will not be so acute as in the Soviet Union. This is be- cause of the general reasons previously cited: the greater ripeness of the objective situation and the existence of Soviet count ries and a great body of revolutionary experience. Inasmuch as American industry is much more deve loped, the workers have more skill and experience than the Ru ssians had; the trusts and the advan ced industrial technique will lend themselves more readily to Socialist re- organization, and besides th ere will not be the need for such swift industria l expansion as in the U.S.S.R. Also the Amer ican capitalist engineers do not form such an air-tight clique as the Russians did and they will not be so strategically situated to sabotage the industries ; in the existing surplus of technicians doubtless large numbers of them, suffering from unemployment and generally bad conditions, will go along wi th the revolution and they will be give n every opportunity to use their skill in the i ndustries. Besides, and this is of de- cisive importance, the Am erican Soviet govern- ment will have at its disp osal the vast experience "},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"296 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA of the Russian workers in the building of Socialist industry and also, if necessary, actual help from their engineers. The American Soviet government will immedi- ately proceed with the diff icult task of creating an adequate supply of reliab le technicians and mana- gers for the industries. The scattered technical in- stitutes, trade schools, co rrespondence schools, etc., will be organized, expande d and linked up directly with the industrie s. Technical school s will be es- tablished at all factories. Workers and their chil- dren will be given the preference in the study of industrial technique. The Collectivization of Agriculture T HE S OVIET system provides a scientific method of organizing agriculture as well as industry. Stalin says: \"To create an economic basis of So- cialism— that means to unite agriculture with Socialist industry into a single economy, and to place agriculture under the leadership of Social- ized industry.\" Private property, production for profit, competition and all the rest of the capital- ist chaos and robbery, have no more place on Soviet farms than in the factories. An immediate and fundamental problem to confront the American Soviet government, theref ore, will be to carry through the Socialist collec tivization of the land. "},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"UNITED SOVIET STATES OF AMERICA 297 This, for the poor and middl e farmers, will be done upon a voluntary basis. In the agrarian question the experience in the Soviet Union is of the most fundamental impor- tance. In their vast move ment of collectivization, described in Chapter II, th e Russians have devel- oped several forms of fa rm organization. Chief among these are the \"kolkoz, \" or artel, with land, draft animals and implements pooled and the joint returns distributed upon the basis of the work done, and the State farm, (\"s ovkhoz\"), with the land farmed directly by the Stat e, (State Farm Trust), and the workers pa id upon a wage basis. There are also the societies fo r the joint cultivation of the land (TSOS), with private property in draft animals, crops, etc., and fi nally, there are the com- munes, with common proper ty in tools, horses, products and dwelli ngs. In all cases the land is owned by the government. The State agriculture organization is grouped un der the Commissariat of Agriculture, and is formed into trusts for various crops and geographical di visions of the industry; such as Grain Trust, Co tton Trust, Flax Trust, Livestock Trust, Hemp Trust, Tea Trust, etc. Crops are sold either di rectly to th e government, to the cooperatives, or, in a very rapidly lessening extent, upon the op en local markets. All these forms have been widely applied. But the most adaptable and basic are the artels and the State farms. The State farms are an unq.ues- "},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"298 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA tioned success, but it is especially along the lines of the artel that the many millions of Russian peas- ants are now regrouping themselves. The collec- tives and State farms, de spite the still existing shortage of machinery, et c., have already proved, by greatly increased outpu t, their vast advance over the old forms of farming. The superiority of such an organized agriculture over the present unorganized American system is evident at a glance. It is like comparing a mod- ern automobile with an ox cart. The Russian farmers, with their vast farms, are producing crops under increasingly scientif ic conditions and then disposing of them to a government which they, to- gether with the industri al workers, completely control. American farmers, on the other hand, in 6,300,000 separate units destitute of organization except for a few cooperat ives and other associa- tions largely controlled by the bankers, capitalist politicians and rich farmers, are all producing, helter-skelter, and then, ha rassed by capitalist loan sharks, industrial trusts, and a hostile government, are selling their crops in open competition with each other and the whole wo rld. It is no surprise, therefore, that while the Russian farmers are blaz- ing ahead to progress an d prosperity, the Amer- ican farmers slump deeper into poverty, stagnation and crisis. The central policy of the American Soviet gov- ernment in agriculture w ill be to reorganize the "},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"UNITED SOVIET STATES OF AMERICA 299 farming system primarily upon the basis of State farms. The position of American agricultural technique and the experience in the U.S.S.R. will justify such a policy. The great ranches of the Far West, the big corporation farms of the Middle West, the huge private esta tes of the millionaires in the East — all confis cated by the new govern- ment — will provide i mmediate bases for many such great State farms. These will be vast model farms, equipped with the most modern machinery and technique. They will raise the level of agri- culture production generally to a new and higher stage. But, doubtless, the artel type of collective farm will also be widely organized. It will be the policy of the government to stimulate the collec- tivization movement, furn ishing the poor farmers with the necessary impl ements, etc. The artel form of farm will provid e a convenient bridge, leading away from individua list, competitive farm- ing and towards the State farm. Once the political power is in the hands of the workers and peasants the collectivization of Amer- ican agriculture, the winni ng of the poorer cate- gories of farmers for the bu ilding of Socialism, will proceed very rapidly. It is true that the American farmer on the average ha s a bigger farm than the Russian peasant had and th at the private property idea is perhaps more deeply ingrained in him, but he is, as we have alrea dy seen, caught between the millstones of capitalist e xploitation and is being "},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"300 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA crushed. The vast majority of the farmers will have everything to gain from the outset by a So- cialized agriculture. Today, despite popular notions to the contrary, the average farmer seri- ously lacks machinery. Th e one million American tractors, not to speak of other costly machines, are now concentrated very largely in the hands of the well-to-do and rich farmers. The poor farmer also lacks fertilizers and has little or no chance to apply modern methods. Collectivization under a Sovi et system will radi- cally change all this. No t only will it furnish the farmer with a boundless ma rket for his products, hut it will also provide hi m with machinery, fer- tilizers, selected seed and general scientific meth- ods on a scale entirel y unknown even on the largest present-day Amer ican farms. The mar- ginal mountain and rocky fa rms in the South, New England, etc., will be ab andoned and the farming industry concentrated and intensified in the most adaptable sections. The revolutionary collecti- vization of the land will effect a profound advance in American agriculture a nd cause a veritable leap forward in the living st andards of the farmer. The Liberation of the Negro T HE CAPITALIST class not only robs the workers as a whole, but it visits special exploitation upon those sections of the working class — Negroes, "},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"UNITED SOVIET STATES OF AMERICA 301 foreign-born, women, youth, the aged, etc.— who, for one reason or another, ar e the least able to de- fend themselves in the class struggle. The Amer- ican Soviet government will drastically eliminate such special discrimination, along with capitalist exploitation generally. Above all, as we have remarked, it is the Negro who is singled out for th e bitterest exploitation and persecution by the capitalists. His condition is comparable only to th at of the \"untouchables\" of India and is the most crying outrage of Amer- ican capitalism. He is set apart as a pariah, an object of contempt and scor n, a victim of the most systematic suppression and enslavement to be found anywhere in the m odern industrial world. The purpose of all this tyranny and repression is, of course, the most in tense robbery of the Negro toilers; for the vast major ity of Negroes are either poor farmers or workers. The Jim-Crow system, with all its cultivated snobbe ry of race, is a device of the ruling classes to whip extra profits out of the hides of the oppressed Negroes by splitting them off from the re st of the toilers. The Republican party, boasted friend of the Negro, is equally responsib le with the Democratic party for the maintenance of this criminal outrage. Such Negro organizations as the Urban League and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, domi nated by the white and Negro capitalists and pett y bourgeoisie, also have "},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"302 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA this responsibility; they li ve by cultivating segrega- tionalism; they sabotage ev ery real fight for the liberation of the Negro. In the case of the framed- up nine Scottsboro Negro boys, the attorney of the N.A.A.C.P. made a purely formal defense, practically coinciding with the prosecution. As for the American Fe deration of Labor, its record on the Negro questi on is one of shame and treachery; it falls into st ep with the whole capitalist policy by barring Negroes from its unions, by blocking their entry into the better-paid jobs, by refusing to fight for thei r burning demands, by cul- tivating the insidious white chauvinism. The measure of the policy of the A.F. of L. on the Negro question is to be seen, for example, in At- lanta, where Negroes are not even allowed to en- ter the local labor temple. The Socialist party, despite all its parade of radi- calism and alleged friendshi p of the Negro, follows the same basic Jim-Crow line as the A.F. of L. This was clearly shown by Heywood Broun, So- cialist leader, when he said: \"If I were a candidate for high executive office, or judiciary office, I would say, even without being cornered, that I would not now sanction the efforts to enforce the 14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\" 6 The Communist party, al one of all the political parties, fights for the lib eration of the Negro, both 6 New York Telegram, Apr. 28, 1930."},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"UNITED SOVIET STATES OF AMERICA 303 in the present-day struggle and as an ultimate goal. The American Soviet gov ernment, immediately it takes power, will deal a shattering blow to the whole monstrous Jim-Crow ism. To destroy it ruthlessly will be one of the real joys of the vic- torious proletarian revolu tion. Every remnant of slavery will be abolished. In a Soviet system, the Negro will have the most complete equality — eco- nomically, politically, soci ally. The doors to every occupation, to every social activity, will be wide open for him. He will have ample land, confis- cated from the great white landlords. He will be free to do and go as any other citizen, without let or hindrance. Attempts to maintain the capitalist white chauvinism and os tracism of the Negroes will be punished as a serious crime against society. Socialism will mean the fi rst real freedom for the Negro. He is beginning to realize this, hence his mass turning to the Comm unist party for leader- ship, and the consequent d eep alarm of the capital- ists and big landowners at this growing unity of white and black toilers. The status of the American Negro is that of an oppressed national mi nority, and only a Soviet sys- tem can solve the questio n of such minorities. This it does, in addition to setting up real equality in the general political and social life, by establish- ing the right of self-d etermination for national minorities in those parts of the country where they constitute the bulk of th e population. The con- "},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"304 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA stitution of the Soviet Un ion provides that, \"Each united republic retains the right of free withdrawal from the Union.\" The Program of the Com- munist International declares for: \"The recognition of the right of all nations, irrespec- tive of race, to complete self-determination, that is, self-determination inclusive of the right to State separa- tion.\" Accordingly, the right of self-determination will apply to Negroes in the American Soviet system. In the so-called Black Belt of the South, where the Negroes are in the majori ty, they w ill have the fullest right to govern th emselves and also such white minorities as may live in this section. The same principle will apply to all the colonial and semi-colonial peoples now dominated by American imperialism in Cuba, the Philippines, Central and South America, etc. And logically, foreign-born workers, now denied the right to vote and ruthle ssly deported, will enjoy the fullest rights of citize nship. One of the most monstrous features of the present attack upon the working class is the deportation of tens of thou- sands of foreign-born workers by Doak's Depart- ment of Labor. These masses of workers, torn away from home and familie s, are sent back to countries with which they have lost all touch. Doak's deportation campaign, part of the capital- ist offensive, is an attempt to terrorize the "},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"UNITED SOVIET STATES OF AMERICA 305 foreign-born workers, to crush every semblance of resistance among them, to split them off from the American-born workers. The wholesale deporta- tion of radical workers and leaders is an attempt to illegalize the Communi st party and the TUUL. The experience with self-determination of na- tional minorities in the S oviet Union shows that the Russians have solved this problem with the revolu- tion. The many national mi norities have the right of self-determination; they have their own lan- guages, their own culture. Yet they all live to- gether in the strongest unity under the general constitution of the U.S. S.R. Where there is no capitalist or feudal exploitation there can be no suppression of weaker na tionalities. The radical liquidation of the \"insolubl e\" Jewish problem in the U.S.S.R. testifies to the completeness of the Bolshevik cure. Murderous pogroms, a curse of old Russia, are now totally eradicated. The Jews enjoy absolute equality wi th all other nationalities. The solution of the question of suppressed nation- alities, a question which causes untold misery in the capitalist world, is one of the greatest achieve- ments of the Russian revolution. The American Soviet will , of course, abolish all restrictions upon racial intermarriage. The argu- ments of Ku Klux Klanners and the like that Negroes are an inferior race and that \"mongrel\" peoples are less capable, have no justification in science and social experien ce. Those \"scientists\" "},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"306 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA who endorse such \"white supremacy\" theories are only so many bought-and-paid-for upholders of the prevailing mode of exploitation. The facts are that all the big peoples of today are already hope- lessly \"mongrel\" and that wherever Negroes have half a chance they demons trate their intellectual equality with the whites. Geographic isolation of the early human stock into widely separated groups brought about its differenti ation into individual races; contact between these various races, bred of modern industrialization, is just as irresistibly breaking down these racial differences and bring- ing about racial amalgamation. The revolution will only hasten this proce ss of integration, already proceeding throughout th e world with increasing tempo. The Emancipation of Woman W HEN woman emerged historically from feudal- ism she was burdened with a whole series of cus- toms, prejudices and restri ctions enslaving her in her work, her personal life and her political status. Characteristically capitali sm, which respects noth- ing in its greed for profits , quickly seized upon all these handicaps of woman and used them to doubly exploit her. This is true of the United States as well as other capitalist countries. The so-called freedom of the American woman is a myth. Either she is a gilded bu tterfly bourgeois parasite or she is an oppressed slave. "},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"UNITED SOVIET STATES OF AMERICA 307 The life of the working class woman and poor farmer's wife is one of drudgery and exploitation. Capitalism sees in her ma inly a breeder of wage slaves and soldiers. The boasted American home, enslaving the woman thr ough her economic in- feriority and her childr en, makes her dependent upon her husband. On a ll sides she confronts medieval sex taboos, assi duously cultivated by the church, State and bourgeoi s moralists. When she goes into industry she has to toil for from a third to a half less than the ma le worker; she works at a killing pace under unhealthful conditions and she is barred from many occupations under the hypo- critical and reactionary slogan, \"The woman's place is in the home\"; th e A.F. of L. betrays her every attempt to organize an d to defend her inter- ests. Politically, she is pr actically a zero, having little or no opportunity to educate herself or to function in an organized manner. Finally, to cap the climax of woman's enslavement, capitalism maintains in full blast the \"oldest profession,\" prostitution. The proletarian revolution will profoundly change all this. The Amer ican Soviet government will immediately set about liquidating the elaborate network of slavery in which woman is enmeshed. She will be freed economic ally, politically and so- cially. The U.S.S.R. shows the general lines along which the emancipati on of woman will also proceed in a Soviet America. "},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"308 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA The Russian woman is free economically, and this is the foundation of all her freedom. Every field of activity is open to her. She is to be found even in such occupations as locomotive engineer, electrical crane operator, machinist, factory di- rector, etc. There are wo men generals in the Red Army, women ambassadors, etc. Two-thirds of the medical students are women. In i ndustry the women are thoroughly organized in the trade unions. They get the same pay as men, and are protected by an elaborate system of maternity and other social insurance. In politics the women of the Soviet Union are a ma jor and militant factor. The Russian woman is also free in her sex life. When married life becomes unwelcome for a couple they are not barbar ously compelled to live together. Divorce is to be had for th e asking by one or both parties. The woman's children are recognized as legitimate by the State and society, whether born in official wedlock or not. The free American woman, like her Russian sister, will eventually scorn the whole fabric of bourgeois sex hypocrisy and prudery. In freeing the woman, Socialism liquidates the drudgery of housework. So important do Com- munists consider this que stion that the Communist International deals with it in its world program. In the Soviet Union th e attack upon housework slavery is delivered from every possible angle. Great factory kitchens are being set up to prepare "},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"UNITED SOVIET STATES OF AMERICA 309 hot, well-balanced meals for home consumption by the millions; communal kitchens in apartment houses are organized widespread. Every device to simplify and reduce hous ework is spread among the masses with all possible dispatch. To free the woman from th e enslavement of the perpetual care of her chil dren is also a major ob- ject of Socialism. To this end in the Soviet Union there is being deve loped the most elaborate system of kindergarten s and playgrounds in the world — in the cities and villages, in the neighbor- hoods and around the factories. Of this develop- ment, Anna Razamova says: \"All these institutions for child welfare mean a great deal in the life of the work ing woman. They free her from the necessity of spending all her time at home, cleaning, cooking and mending. While she is at work she can be sure that her child is being well taken care of, and that it is supervized by trained nurses and teachers, and gets wholesome food at regular hours.\" 6 The free Russian woman is the trail blazer for the toiling women of the wo rld. She is beating out a path which, ere long, her American sister will begin to follow.

The starved ma sses of workers, har- assed by low wages and une mployment, are unable to feed their children pr operly, and the State cal- lously shrugs its shoulders at the problem. Great masses of them slave in the industries, while their parents go around jobless. The position of the workers' children has na turally grown immeasur- ably worse during the present industrial crisis. The Nation, (Mar. 23, 1 932), exposes a typical condition when it declares : \"5,000 to 10,000 chil- dren in Detroit are daily in child bread lines.\" Regarding a recent inve stigation of conditions among continuation schoo l boys in New York, Grace Hutchens states: \"Of 2,700 working boys, less than one in seven was found free from physical defects. One-fifth of them were under-weight from under-nourishment. Three-fifths needed dental care.

Most of these difficulties could have been prevented.\" 7 The Labour Research Association says in its Bulletin of Nov. 9, 1931: \"In Detroit, in a single scho ol in the working class dis- trict, 500 children refused to report for classes. Investi- gation showed that more than half of them lacked even clothes and shoes. In Chicago, children are fainting from lack of food and 15,000 ar e starving. In Cleveland, the number of under-nourished children in the elementary schools will reach 15,000 before the end of the present term. A recent study of 290 typical children in West Virginia coal towns by Dr. Ruth Fox of the Fifth Avenue Hospital in New York City, s howed that in Ward, W. Va., their average weight was 12% below the standard.\" The generally disastrous effects of such condi- tions may be better imag ined than described. Capitalism, besides thus feeding, vamp ire-like upon children, no less ruthless ly exploits the youth, who are becoming an ever-greater factor in industry. It drives their immature bodies at a pace in pro- duction which even adu lt workers cannot endure; it forces them to work at lower wages than grown- ups; child labor laws are \"more honored in the breach than in the observance.\" Special victims in this raw exploitation are the Negro youth. Such barbarous conditions for the youth are, of course, utterly alien to Socialism.

Not even in the darkest days of the ci vil war, when hunger and pestilence were rampant, was the welfare of the youth ever lost sight of in the U.S.S.R. They always had plenty, alt hough often their parents were semi-starved. A bourgeois correspondent, Julia Blanshard, says: \"Youth is one of the first concerns of Soviet Russia.

And such driving as exists among the millions of youn g workers in American industries is unhear d of. The Russian young workers work only six hours daily; they are shielded from night work and especially danger- ous or heavy toil. The Soviet Union is the only country in the world where the youth are paid equal wage rates with ad ults for similar work. The health and education of the young workers is promoted by vast sport and cultural organizations. In politics the youth are a real factor, the fran- chise being based upon th e principle, \"Old enough to work, old enough to vote.\" In every walk in life the antiquated prejudices that the \"elders\" alone must lead have been broken down and the path is clear for the deve lopment of full leadership on the basis of ability and regardless of age.

The prevailing systems of education, morality, ethics, science, art, patriotism, religion, etc., are as defin itely parts of capitalist exploitation as the stoc k exchange. The schools, churches, newspapers, moti on pictures, radio, thea- tres and various other avenues of publicity and mass instruction are the organized propaganda ma- chinery of the ruling class. The chief aims of bourgeoi s culture, so far as it is directed towards the wo rking class, are to de- velop the workers into, (1) slave-like robots who will accept uncomplainingly whatever standards of life and work the owners of industry see fit to grant them; (2) unthinking soldiers who will en- thusiastically get themselv es killed off in defense of their masters' rulershi p; (3) superstitious dolts who will satisfy themselves with a promise of para- dise after death as a s ubstitute for a decent life here on earth. To these e nds the workers are regi- mented in the schools, poi soned by the militaristic Boy Scouts and C.M.T.C., en meshed in fascist-like sport organizations, herded into the strike-break- ing Y.M.C.A., stuffed with endless rot in the news- papers and movies, jammed into religious training before they are able to think for themselves, etc. As for real education, ab out all the workers get of it in school is the minimum of the three R's re- quired to enable them to perform the tasks allotted them in industry. So far as this culture is directed to the bourgeoisie"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"UNITED SOVIET STATES OF AMERICA 315 and petty bourgeoisie, it results in a mass produc- tion of capitalist intellect ual robots. The schools and colleges, firmly in the grip of finance capital, as Upton Sinclair so co mpletely showed in his book, The Goose Step, are great manufacto- ries of Babbitts. In no c ountry is culture so de- based by capitalism as in the United States. Essentially a gigantic e ffort to perpetuate the robbery of the workers, it is sterile, hypocritical, colorless, lifeless. Americ a's capitalist ic writers are engaged in trying to convince the working class what a glorious thing it is to be a wage slave; her artists and poets are bu sy glorifying Heinz's pickles and the advertising pages of The Saturday Evening Post; her drama tists and musicians are cooking up patriotic slush and idiotic sex stories to divert the masses from their troubles and the hopeless boredom of capitalis t life; her scientists are trying to prove the un ity of science and re- ligion, etc., etc. The proletaria n revolution in the United States will at once make a devast ating slash into this maze of hypocrisy and intellectual rubbish.

In making the cultural revolution in the United States, the workers and farmers, faci ng the same general prob- lems as the Russians, will solve them along similar lines. Curing Crime and Criminals C APITALISM , by its very nature, is a prolific breeder of crime. It is a system of legalized robbery of the working class. The w hole process of capitalist business is a swindle and an armed hold-up. In capitalist society what c onstitutes crime and what does not is a purely arb itrary distinction. The capitalists do not recogni ze any line of demarca- tion for themselves. They do whatever they can \"get away with.\" The reco rd of every large for- tune and big corporation in this country is smeared not only with brutal robbery of the workers but also statutory crime of every description, from the bribery of legislatures to plain murder. Wall Street is full of uncaught Kreugers. In a society where each grabs what he can at the expense of the rest, naturally the government of- fers a wide field of corruption. It is a well-known fact, emphasized afresh by the Seabury investiga- tion in New York, that every city and State in this country is controlled by grafting politicians, allied with the criminal underwo rld. The Teapot Dome scandal, not to mention numerous others, shows that the national government is also permeated with "},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"320 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA this gross corruption. Such corruption is not a special condition, but of the very tissue of capi- talism. It is not surprising that in a system of society where the aim is to get rich by any means, crime of every kind should flouri sh. Faced by low wages and other impossible economic conditions on the one hand and by the co rrupt example of capi- talism generally on the other, many naturally take to lives of open crime and try to seize at the point of a gun what the capita list \"big shots\" steal through exploiting the work ers, by a corner on the stock exchange, or by corrupting the government. The main difference betw een their operations is primarily one of dimensi on. Al Capone is an al- together legitimate child of American capitalism, and it is no accident that he is an object of such widespread admiration. The American Soviet gove rnment will liquidate the mounting crime wave wh ich, according to the Wickersham committee, co sts the government a billion dollars yearly. So cialism, by putting an end to capitalist exploitati on, deals a mortal blow at crime of every descri ption. The economic base of crime is destroyed. Th e worker is enabled to live and work under the best possible conditions. There is no place for human sharks to prey upon their fellow men. Not onl y does the abolition of capitalism destroy the basis of the so-called crimes against property, but the revolutionized economic "},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"UNITED SOVIET STATES OF AMERICA 321 and social conditions, invo lving an intelligent moral code and effective educati onal system, also greatly diminish the \"crimes of passion.\" These facts are already demonstrated in the Soviet Union, which is fast becoming a crimeless country. While the exigencies of the revolutionary struggle against the counter-revolution made it necessary, from time to ti me, to confine a consid- erable number of political prisoners, this need is now fast passing with the consolidation of the So- cialist regime and the liqui dation of the last rem- nants of the exploiting classes in the Soviet Union. Life and property are safe r now in the U.S.S.R. than in any other country in the world. Crime is rapidly sinking into abeyance and this will be more and more the case as the new society becomes strengthened. Capitalism blames crime upon the individual, in- stead of upon the bad social conditions which produce it. Hence its trea tment of crime is es- sentially one of punishmen t. But the failure of its prisons, with their terrible sex-starvation, graft, over-crowding, idleness, stupid discipline, fero- ciously long sentences and general brutality, is overwhelmingly demonstr ated by the rapidly mounting numbers of pris oners and the long list of terrible prison riots. Capitalist prisons are actually schools of crim e. Even the standpat Wickersham committee had to condemn the atro- "},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"322 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA cious American prison syst em as brutal, medieval and fruitless. Socialist criminology, on the other hand, attacks the bad social conditions. While the American Soviet government will ru thlessly break up the underworld gangs that brazen ly infest all American cities and will also give short shrift to grafting politicians, its prison system will be essentially educational in character. In the new Russian prisons, for example, the prisoners have the right to marry and to live with their families; they are taught useful trades and are paid full union wages for their work; there are no guards or walls or bars; the discipline is organized entirely by the prisoners themselves. The prisoners are also al- lowed freely to visit their friends in other towns. The lengths of the terms to be served are deter- mined by the prisoners' committees, on the basis of the fitness of the given prisoners to resume their places in society. The whole terminology of crime, criminal, prison, etc., has been abandoned in such institutions. Upon release, a prisoner is not only able to make his way in society but is welcomed. He is eligible to belong to the Communist party. It requires very little imagination to see the great advantages of this Socialist system over the bar- barous prisons of capitalist countries. Congress- man W. I. Sirovich, (Dem ., N. Y.), said, after a recent visit to th e Soviet Union, \"The Russian "},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"UNITED SOVIET STATES OF AMERICA 323 prison system sets an ex ample that is worthy of emulation by any nation in the world.\" 10 Prohibition, based upon a criminal alliance be- tween capitalists, crooked politicians and gang- sters, has bred a growth of criminals such as the world has never seen before. And the \"best minds\" of the country stand powerless before the problem. The American Soviet government will deal with this question by eliminating prohibition, by establishing government control of the manu- facture and sale of alcoholic liquors; these meas- ures to be supported by an energetic campaign among the masses against excessive drinking. This way of handling th e prohibition question is working successfully in the Soviet Union. Shortly after the October revoluti on the Soviet government prohibited the sale or manufacture of alcoholic drinks. But soon bootleggi ng began, with familiar demoralizing consequenc es: poisonous liquor was made, much badly-needed grain was wasted, open violation of the law existed on all sides. Then, with characteristic vigor and clarity of purpose, the government legalized the making and selling of intoxicating beverages. At the same time, a big campaign was initiated by the government, the Party, the trade unions, et c., to educat e the work- ers against alcoholism. Th is program is succeed- ing; the evils of alcoho lism are definitely on the decline. Do ubtless, the Russian s have found the 10 New York Journal, Dec. 1, 1931."},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"324 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA real solution of the liquo r question. Just as So- cialism is abolishing so many other evils, it is also rapidly wiping ou t alcoholism and the mass of misery and degradation that accompanies it. The Abolition of War O NE OF the revolutionary achie vements of victori- ous world Communism will be the ending of war. In Chapter I we have seen the great and growing danger of a new world war and also the utter futility of all the capitalist peace pacts and dis- armament schemes as war preventives. We have also seen the economic forces of imperialism be- hind the war danger. So long as capitalism lasts war must continue to curs e the human race. It is the historical task of the proletariat to put an end to this hoary monster. Th is it will do by destroy- ing the capitalist system and with it the economic causes that bring about war. It is characteristic of capitalism to justify all the robbery and misery and terrors of its system by seeking to create the impression that they are caused by basic traits in human nature, or even by \"acts of god.\" Thus we find current many metaphysical and mysterious explanations of the present crisis and unemp loyment. These pre- ventable disasters are made to appear almost as natural phenomena over which mankind has no control, like tornadoes and earthquakes. The "},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"UNITED SOVIET STATES OF AMERICA 325 same general attitude is taken with regard to war. War is put forth as arisi ng out of the very nature of humanity. Man is pictured as a war-like ani- mal, and therefore capita lism escapes responsi- bility. War becomes mo re or less inevitable. This is all nonsense, of course. Ma n is by na- ture a gregarious and friendly animal. He does not make war because he dislikes others of his own species, differing from him in language, religion, geographical location, etc. His wars have always arisen out of struggles over the very material things of wealth and power. This is true, whether he has been living in a tribal, sl ave, feudal or capitalist economy, and whether he has obscured the true cause of his wars with an intense religious garb or with slogans about making the world safe for democracy. The cause of modern war is, as we have already seen, the impe rialistic polic ies of the capitalist nations to rob the colonial peoples, to smash back the growing revolutionary movement, to crush each other in the world struggle for mar- kets, raw materials and territory. In a society in which there is no priv ate property in industry and land, in which no e xploitation of the workers takes place and where plenty is produced for all, there can be no grounds for war. The interests of a Socialist so ciety are fundamentally opposed to the murderous and unnatur al struggle of inter- national war. Under capitalism the work ers, by militant and"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"326 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA well-organized struggle, can check the develop- ment of war. By the threat of revolution they can, for a time, force the capita lists to hold in leash their dogs of war. This fe ar has contributed basi- cally to holding the capital ist governments so long from making another open armed attack upon the Soviet Union. But pressure from the workers can only delay the war, not stop it permanently. The irresistible and incurabl e antagonisms of the capi- talist countries inevitabl y force them into war, revolution or no revolution. Only the proletarian revolution itself can solve these war-breeding con- tradictions and put a fina l end to war. Not Chris- tianity but Communism will bring peace on earth. A Communist world will be a unified, organized world. The economic system will be one great organization, based upon th e principle of planning now dawning in the U.S.S.R. The American Soviet government will be an important section in this world organization. In such a society there will be no tariffs or the ma ny other barriers erected by capitalism against a free world interchange of goods. The raw material supplies of the world will be at the disposition of the peoples of the world. Politically, the wo rld will be organized. There will be no colonies, no \"s pheres of influence,\" no hypocritical \"open doors.\" The toilers will then have fully realized Marx's famous slogan, \"Work- ingmen of the World, Un ite!\" The interests of the toiling masses in the various countries will not "},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"UNITED SOVIET STATES OF AMERICA 327 be in conflict, but in harmony with each other. Those who speak of \"red imperialism\" repeat the calumnies of capitalism. Once the power of the bourgeoisie is broken intern ationally and its States destroyed, the world So viet Union will develop towards a scientific administration of things, as Engels describes. There will be no place for the present narrow patriotism, the bigoted nationalist chauvinism that serves so well the capitalist war- makers. Armies and navies, rendered obsolete, will be disbanded. Grim war will meet its Waterloo. At the meeting of the League of Nations' Pre- paratory Commission for Disarmament at Geneva in November, 1927, the representatives of the Soviet Union presented a proposal for complete world disarmament. It wa s later re-enforced by the Soviet Union's proposal for a general economic non-aggression pact, by its non-aggression treaties with individual governments, and by its generally firm peace policy in the face of imperialist provo- cation. But, of course, the impe rialist capitalist nations did not accept the Soviet Union's plan for doing away with war. The U.S.S.R. is the only country that genuinely struggle s for peace; the capitalist powers need war in their business. War is not to be ended in capitalist p eace conferences, but by revolutionary struggle of th e toiling masses against capitalism itself. Henc e, inevitably, the capital- "},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"328 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA ists at Geneva ridicule d the Soviet 1927 proposals and shortly afterwards adopted as a substitute the supremely hypocritical Ke llogg Peace Pact, mean- while intensifying their own war preparations. They have again rejected the Soviet Union's dis- armament proposal at the present Geneva con- ference. Thereby they expose afresh to the workers of the world the fact that they do not want peace, but war. It will be only when the workers and peasants have finally defeated international capitalism and are assemb led to re-organize the world on a Socialist basis that a proposal for gen- eral disarmament will be adopted and carried into effect. This event, being irresistibly prepared by the deepening capitalist crisis and the growing mobilization of the world's toilers under the leader- ship of the Communist International, will take place sooner than the worl d bourgeoisie dare think and it will be one of the ve ry greatest steps forward ever taken by the human race. Socialist Incentive O NE OF the classical capitalist arguments against Socialism is that it would destroy incentive; that is, if private property in industry and the right to exploit the workers were abolished the urge for social progress, and even for day-to-day produc- tion, would be killed. But the Russian revolu tion has shattered this"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"UNITED SOVIET STATES OF AMERICA 329 contention irreparably. The Russian workers and peasants are building Social ism with a mass energy and enthusiasm quite unparalleled in history. Manifestly, they are prope lled by a great incen- tive. This is a marvel to the bourgeois newspaper correspondents. But it is ju st as Marx, three gen- erations ago, said it w ould be under Socialism. The incentive of the Russian toilers is easily ex- plained. They own the c ountry and everything in it. There is no exploiting class to rob them of the fruits of their toil. Th ey welcome better produc- tion methods because they get the full benefit of them. They have broken th e chain of capitalist slavery and are building a new world of liberty, prosperity and happiness for themselves and fam- ilies. It is equally unde rstandable w hy the pro- ducing masses in capitalist countries betray no such enthusiasm in their work . The latter are robbed of what they produce; for them improvements in production mean wage-cuts and unemployment. Incentive under capitalism is confined practically to the exploiting classes and their hangers-on. It is only with the advent of Socialism that the great masses develop real incentive. Socialist incentive in the Soviet Union explains why the workers so militan tly defended the revo- lution against the many ca pitalist armies in 1918- 20, and why they have en dured famine and pesti- lence for the revolution. In the industries it is an intelligent mass incent ive that provides the basis "},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"330 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA for the keen Socialist comp etition, for shock-bri- gades to speed production, for the self-imposed labor discipline, for the heroic present-day self- denial in putting the Five-Y ear Plan into effect so that a solid base of hea vy industry may be quickly laid for the Socialist prosperity. In view of all this mass interest and initiative of the workers in Soviet industry current capitalist charges about \"forced labor\" in the U.S.S.R. stand exposed as ridiculous. Forced labor is native to capitalism, not Socialis m. The whole Socialist system is utterly antagon istic to any enslavement of the workers. Even bourgeois writers and poli- ticians are beginning to admit this. H. R. Mussey says: \"If anybody wants a bargain in forced la- bor, or any other kind of labor, I should advise him not to look fo r it in Russia just now, as far as I have seen it; for it is a seller's market in labor if ever there was one.\" 11 Rep. H. T. Rainey, Democratic House leader, declares: \"Labor is freer in Russia than in any other country in the world.\" 12 The differentiated wage scales, including piece- work, in the Soviet Union constitute no contradic- tion to the prevalent strong mass incentive. Temporarily, they must se rve to stimulate the less conscious elements to acqui re skill and to produce. The wage system as a w hole is a hang-over from 11 The Nation, Nov. 4, 1931. 12 New York World-Telegram, Apr. 8, 1932."},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"UNITED SOVIET STATES OF AMERICA 331 capitalism, part of the baggage that has to be dis- carded during the tran sition from capitalism to Communism. Improved production methods and general education will so lve that problem. Re- cently Stalin said, in polemizing against tendencies to at once equalize wages: \"Marx and Lenin said that the differences between skilled and unskilled work would continue to exist even under Socialism and even after the classes had been anni- hilated, that only under Comm unism would this difference disappear, that therefore, even under Socialism 'wages' must be paid according to the labor performed and not according to need.\" 13 Besides the revolutionary enthusiasm and initia- tive of the masses and ma ny other indications al- ready present of the eventu al wageless system there is the \"Party maximum. \" That is, the members of the Communist party have a set wage limit above which they cannot go. Thus Stalin gets the same wages, as many hundreds of thousands of other workers and much less th an large numbers of non- Party mechanics and engi neers. \"Russia,\" says Stuart Chase, \"has achie ved more progress and de- veloped more initiative on $150 a month, the of- ficial Party salary, than any other nation has ever dreamed of in an equal period.\" 14 It is exactly in the in centive of the workers and poor farmers that the pr oletarian revolution has 13 Speech delivered on June 23, 1931. 14 The Philadelphia Record, Nov. 22, 1931."},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"332 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA its great motive force. Th is is what gains it the support of the masses, wh at carries it through a thousand trials and tribulations, what is driving through the Five-Year Plan successfully and what will eventually build a world system of Commu- nism. Mussey, in the a bove-quoted article from The Nation, issues the following warning to the capitalist class: \"If the rulers of the western world would retain their leadership, even in part, then I am persuaded that they and their apologists would do well without further delay to recognize the profound significance of that combina- tion of motives on the basis of which the Russians have accomplished the impossibilities of the past 14 years and to cease their parrot-like ite ration of the impossibility of successful appeal in industry to anything except in- dividual cupidity. The Russian construction marvels of 1931 — and they are marvel s — are not built on indi- vidual cupidity.\" Collectivism and Individualism D EFENDERS of capitalism declare that Socialism destroys individualism. Bu t when they speak of individualism they have in mind the right of freely exploiting the workers. Th ey mean that the anti- social individualism of ca pitalism will go. Under Socialism no one will have the right to exploit another; no longer w ill a profit-hungr y employer be able to shut his fact ory gates and sentence thou- sands to starvation; no more will it be possible for "},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"UNITED SOVIET STATES OF AMERICA 333 a little clique of capitalists and thei r political hench- men to plunge the world in to a blood-bath of war. Yes, such deadly indi vidualism is doomed. But the revolution will create in its stead a new and better development of the individual. The collec- tivist society of Socia lism, by freeing the masses from economic and political slavery will, for the first time in history, gi ve the masses an opportunity to fully develop and ex press their personalities. Theirs will be an indivi duality growing out of and harmonizing with the intere sts of all. It will not have the objective of one's getting rich by robbing the toilers, but will develo p itself in the direction of achievement in science, industrial technique, art, sports, etc. A typical ex ample of this new motive was the case of Lensky, a worker in the \"Pneu- matics\" factory of Leningrad who recently in- vented a very valuable electric-pneumatic meter: given 120,000 rubles as a reward, he immediately presented the money to various cultural organiza- tions. The boast of capitalist a pologists about the equal opportunity which their soci ety affords, that it is a case of the survival of th e fittest, is a tissue of lies. What equality is there betwee n a Vander- bilt and a poor miner ? And as for the fittest sur- viving, under capitalism, th is means those strongest financially. Harr y K. Thaw is a glowing example of capitalist survival of the fittest. Only Social- ism can provide equality of opportunity, which "},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"334 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA means a genuine occasion for the masses to enjoy life and to develop their latent personalities. Socialism, it is also argue d, kills the spirit of competition in society. That is more nonsense. Under Socialism men and women strive for supe- riority in achievement just as naturally as boys do in a foot race. But not on the basis of privately- owned, competitive indus try. Indeed, Socialism will introduce the first r eal competition since the days of primitive Communi sm. Lenin, in an ar- ticle written in 1918, says: \"Socialism does not only not extinguish competition but on the contrary for the first time creates possibilities to apply competition widely, on a real mass scale, to draw the majority of the workers into the field of this work, where they can really show themselves, where they can develop their abilities, disclose their talents which are an untouched source among the masses and which capitalism trampled upon, crushed and st rangled by thousands and millions.\" Stalin thus describes the basically different capi- talist and Socialist competition: \"The principle of capitalist competition is defeat and death for some and victory for others. The principle of Socialist competition is, comradely assistance to those lagging behind the more advanced, with the purpose to reach general advancement\" The history of the Russia n revolution to date en- tirely bears out these statements of Lenin and Sta- lin. Socialist co mpetition is one of the main "},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"UNITED SOVIET STATES OF AMERICA 335 driving forces of the re volutionary de velopment. In view of the basic tasks now confronting the Soviet Union, it is inevitab le that the most striking manifestation of the ne w Socialist competition should relate to the bu ildng and operation of the industries. This, which we have described in Chapter II, is a gigantic factor in carrying through the Five-Year Plan. But Socialist competition runs into every other field of endeavor as well, and it will play an increasing role as the new Socialist system gets a more solid foundation. The existence of a stro ng mass incentive and a lively spirit of competition under Socialism effec- tually disposes of the time-worn \"dead level of Socialism\" theory. Not So cialism, but capitalism, with its exploitation, te rrorism, war, superstition, and cultivated illiteracy, creates a dead level in its poverty and ignorance fo r the uncounted millions of toilers of field and factory. It is precisely Socialism that will de stroy this dead level. But the capitalists, as is their wont, seek to jus- tify their destructive type of competition by assert- ing that it is rooted firmly in human nature. Such appeals to \"human nature,\" however, must be taken cautiously. By that met hod of reasoning it would be quite easy to conclude that the rich capitalist who heartlessly casts workers out of his shops pen- niless and gives no thought as to their future has quite a different \"human nature\" than the African Negro hunter who, with his high sense of clan soli- "},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"336 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA darity, before eating his kill, calls loudly in the four directions in case perchance there may be another hungry hunter nearby. Changed social conditions develop differe nt \"human natures.\" Thus competition, a ruinous , anti-social thing un- der capitalism, becomes, under Socialism, highly beneficent. In recent years the ar gument against the ap- proaching \"dead level\" of Socialism has taken on a new development. Now machinery itself is be- ing roundly denounced as a \"dead leveller.\" Wide fear is expressed that we are going into a regime of such standardization an d mechanization that life is becoming merely a mach ine-like process and the people so many robots. This fear is essentially a class fear. The petty bourgeoisie, including th eir writers and poets, dread the machine because it wipes out their class base, small industry; becau se it brings the further subjugation of their class to the bankers and big industrialists. Many capita list economists, like Foster and Catchings, Tugwell, Chase, 15 etc., also fear the machine and mode rn methods of mass pro- duction, because they sens e their revolutionary con- sequences. They see the growing volume of production, the sh rinking markets, the increasing 15 Chase, although stating that, on the whole, the effect of the machine has been progressive, is manifestly alarmed. In Men and Machines, p. 348, his fear and confusion are expressed by his empty program of meet ing the problem of the machine without a plan, \"with nothing to guide us but our naked intelligence and a will to conquer.\" "},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"UNITED SOVIET STATES OF AMERICA 337 unemployment, the radicalization of the producing masses, the growing revo lutionary struggle, and they tremble at the pros pect. In Montreal, ac- cording to a United Press dispatch of Feb. 23, 1932, the Canadian governme nt buried a toy steam- shovel ceremoniously, decl aring that its \"future policy will be to engage manual laborers and to scrap machinery wherever advisable.\" Anti-machine propaganda like that of Gandhi, Spengler, etc., is the absu rdity of capitalism in despair and decline. None such will be found in the Soviet Union. The Sovi et workers do not fear the machine. They see in it an emancipator from the drudgery and poverty of the past. They have no dread of ensuing indus trial crises and unem- ployment. They will contro l the machine; not let it enslave them as it ha s done under capitalism. Nor do they fear that it will create a \"dead level,\" standardized, un interesting world. Such con- ditions can only develop under capitalism where everything is made for profit's sake. Capitalism naturally develops a hopeless babbittry in every direction; but Socialis m produces inevitably the intelligent and the beautiful. Under Socialism th e machine will be used on the broadest scale possible to produce the necessities of life in the great industr ies, transport systems and communication services. It would be the sheer- est nonsense and quite impossible not to take ad- vantage of every labor and time-saving device. "},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"338 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA But Socialist society will also know how to develop the variegated and artis tic. Where the creative impulses of the masses ar e not checked by poverty and slavery, where the arts and sciences are not hamstrung by the profit-making motive, where the masses are not pois oned by anti-social codes of morals and ethics, and where every assistance of the free community is given to the maximum cul- tivation of the intellectua l and artistic powers of the masses — there we need have no fear that so- ciety will be robotized by the machine. Life under a Communist society will be varied and interesting. Individual will vie with individ- ual, as never before, to create the useful and the beautiful. Locality will co mpete with locality in the beauty of their arch itecture. The impress of individuality and origina lity will be upon every- thing. The world will b ecome a place well worth living in, and what is the most important, its joys will not be the niggardly monopoly of a privileged ruling class but the herita ge of the great producing masses. Building a New World T HE PROLETARIAN revolution is the most profound of all revolutions in hist ory. It initiates changes more rapid and far-reachi ng than any in the whole experience of mankind. Th e hundreds of millions of workers and peasants, striking off their age-old chains of slavery, will c onstruct a society of liberty "},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"UNITED SOVIET STATES OF AMERICA 389 and prosperity and intell igence. Communism will inaugurate a new era for th e human race, the build- ing of a new world. The overthrow of capitalism and the develop- ment of Communism will bring about the immedi- ate or eventual solution of many great social problems. Some of these originate in capitalism, and others have plagued the human race for scores of centuries. Among them are war, religious superstition, prostitution, famine, pestilence, crime, poverty, alcoholism, unem ployment, illiteracy, race and national chauvinism , the suppression of woman, and every form of slavery and exploita- tion of one class by another. Already in the Soviet Union, with the revolution still in its initial stages, the forces are distinctly to be seen at work that will eventually liquidate these handicaps to the happiness and progress of the human race. But, of course, only a system of developed world Com- munism can fully uproot and destroy all these evils. The objective conditions, in the shape of scien- tific knowledge and the mean s of creating material wealth, are already at ha nd in sufficient measure to do away with these menaces to humanity. But the trouble lies with the s ubjective facto r, the capi- talist order of society. Capitalism, based upon human exploitation, stands as the great barrier to social progress. Communi sm, by abolishing the capitalist system, liquidates this subjective diffi- "},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"340 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA culty. It releases ther eby productive forces strong enough to provide plenty for all and it de- stroys the whole accomp anying capitalist baggage of cultivated ignorance, strife and misery. Com- munism frees humanity from the stultifying effects of the present essentially animal struggle for ex- istence and opens up before it new horizons of joys and tasks. The day is not so far distant when our children, immersed in this new life, will look back with horror upon ca pitalism and marvel how we tolerated it so long. Communist society, in it s battle onward and up- ward, will attack and carry through many pro- found measures besides those mentioned. Among these will be the organiza tion of the economics of the world upon a rational and planned basis, the systematic conservation a nd increase of the world's natural resources, the development of a vast con- centration upon all the gr eat problems now con- fronting science, the beauti ficat ion of the world by a new and richer artistry, the liquidation of con- gested cities and the comb ination of the joys and conveniences of country and urban life, and the solution of many other great problems and tasks now hardly even imagined. Communist society, however, will not confine it- self simply to thus deve loping the objective condi- tions for a better life. Especially will it turn its attention to the subjective factor, to the funda- mental improvement of man himself. Capitalism, "},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"UNITED SOVIET STATES OF AMERICA 341 with its wars, wage slavery, slums, crooked doctors, etc., undermines the health of the race and destroys its physique. Communism, with its healthful dwellings and working conditions, its pure food, physical culture, etc., wi ll make good health, like thorough education, the pr operty of all. Already this is becoming so in the Soviet Union. But this will be only a beginning. Communist society will go farther. It will scie ntifically regulate the growth of population. It will especially speed up the very evolution of man himself, his brain and body. Capitalism has chec ked the evolution of the human species, if it has not actually brought about a process of race degeneration. But Com- munism will systematica lly breed up mankind. Already the scientific know ledge is at hand to do this, but it is at present inapplicable because of the idiocy of the capitalis t system, its planlessness, its antiquated moral codes, its warp and woof of exploitation. For many generations the long list of Utopians, the Platos, Mores, Fourie rs, Owens, and Bellamys, have dreamed and planned id eal states of society. Their strong point was th at they sensed mankind's capacity for a higher soci al life than the existing wild scramble. But their w eak point, and this was decisive, was that they di d not know what was the matter with society nor how to cure it. They had not the slightest concepti on of either the objective or subjective conditions necessary for social revo- "},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"342 TOWARD SOVIET AMERICA lution. Their Utopias, mere speculations discon- nected from actual life, fell upon deaf ears. It has remained for the modern proletariat, un- der the brilliant leadership of Marx and Lenin, to find the revolutionary wa y to the higher social order, on the basis of the i ndustrial and social con- ditions set up by capitalis m. Marxians have been able to analyze capitalism scientifically, to work out a correct program and st rategy of struggle, to establish effective orga nization among the workers and peasants, to master ge nerally the laws of so- cial development. Consequently, with the objec- tive situation becoming ever more ripe, the revolution no long er appears as an abstraction, a mere theory. Today, Soci alism is a great living world reality. As Polakov says, \"The Russian 'experiment' is an experi ment no more.\" In the Soviet Union the first great breach has been made in the walls of capitalis m. The rest will follow apace. And we may be sure that the revolution, in its upward course, will carry humanity to heights of happiness and achievement far beyond the dreams of even the most hopeful Utopians. American imperialism is now strong. Its cham- pions ridicule the idea of a revolution. But their assurance is not now quite so sure as it was a couple of years ago, before the great industrial collapse. They are beginning to f eel a deadly fear. The Russian revolution is to them such a terrible reality. But they console themselv es with the thought that "},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"UNITED SOVIET STATES OF AMERICA 343 \"it can never happen in this country,\" and they scorn the at-present weak Communist party. But they overlook the detail that the same attitude was taken towards the pre-revolution Bolsheviki. Especially did th e Socialist Mogul s of the Second International look upon them as narrow sectarians and upon Lenin as a fana tical dreamer. But one thing is certain, American capitalism is part and parcel of the world capitalis t system and is subject to all its basic weaknesse s and contradictions; it travels the same way to it s destruction as capitalism in general. The world capitalist syst em is in decay. All the king's horses and all th e king's men cannot save it. Its general crisis deep ens; the masses develop revolutionary consciousness; the international revo- lutionary storm forces ga ther. Capitalism, it is true, makes a strong a nd stubborn resistance. The advance of the revoluti on is difficult, its pace is slow, and it varies from country to country, but its direction is sure and its movement irresistible. Under the leadership of the Communist Inter- national the toilers of the world are organizing to put a final end to the long, long ages of ignorance and slavery, of which cap italist imperialism is the last stage, and to begin building a prosperous and intelligent society commensu rate with the levels to which social knowledge and production possibilities have reached.
