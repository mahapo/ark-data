[{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Informal Alliance Informal Alliance is the first archive-based history of the secretive Bilderberg Group, the high-level transatlantic elite network founded at the height of the Cold War. Making extensive use of the recently opened Bilderberg Group archives as well as a wide range of private and official collections, it shows the significance of informal diplomacy in a fast-changing world of Cold War, decolonization, and globalization. By analyzing the global mindset of the postwar transatlantic elite and by focusing on private, transnational modes of communication and coordination, this study provides important new insights into the history of transatlantic relations, anti-Americanism, Western anti-communism, and European integration during the 1950s and 1960s. In formal Alliance also debunks the persistent myth that the Bi lderberg Group was created by the CIA and repudiates widespread conspiracy theo - ries alleging that Bilderberg was some sort of secret world government.

What went wrong during the 1930s was, to a considerable degree, a failure of the industrialized world to cooperate in the face of a global economic crisis, as well as a failure of the civilized world to respond jointly to Ita lian, Ja panese, or German aggression. This, at least, is how many of those in - volved in rebuilding the world after World War II saw it. These international - ists were determined not to repeat that mistake; accordingly, they developed an interlocking system of multilateral institutions designed for the more ef - fective functioning of international cooperation and coordination. If the initial thrust of internationalism had been economic and global – with the creation of the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) – the emerging Cold War quickly forced internationalists in the United States and Europe to become more and more Atlanticist, needing to concentrate their attention on questions of regional security in Europe and the Atlantic area. This explains why the Marshall Plan soon turned into a program for military assistance, and it explains why the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 quickly turned from a paper treaty into an integrated mil - itary organization (NATO) with a vast US military presence on European ground. It also explains why, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the United States became so much more deeply involved in European affairs than any - one had thought necessary at war’s end. Introduction"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"2 Introduction No t surprisingly, this deepening American involvement in European affairs caused frequent transatlantic tensions and misunderstandings. Eu ropean interests, after all, did not always coincide with American inter - ests, and Europe’s economic and military dependence inevitably generated anti- Am erican resentment as European prestige and pride took a hit. The need to coordinate policies, moreover, frequently displayed the truth of Churchill’s dictum: “there is only one thing worse than fighting with allies, and that is fighting without them.” The official institutions and leaders of the Atlantic alliance, for one, turned out not to be very good at dealing with these tensions. 2 In part, this reflected the intricacies of US foreign pol - icy decision- ma king, which involved such a large number of executive and congressional players that the added complexity of allied consultation fre - quently proved too much. But it was also the quite natural reaction to the sudden rise of the United States as the superpower chiefly responsible for Western Europe’s security. This is where the Bilderberg Group, founded in 1952, came in. One of the main arguments set forth in this book is that the Bilderberg Group formed an important part of what I call the informal alliance – as opposed to the official alliance consisting of NATO, the Organization for Economic Co operation and Development (OECD), and other multilateral institutions. The informal alliance had its origins in the early Cold War and consisted of a fast-growing group of private or semi-private transnational organiza - tions engaged in fostering and promoting cooperation and understanding within the Western world. The fact that global communication systems and intercontinental air travel were creating what Wendell Willkie, in his 1943 bestseller, had called “One World” made frequent transatlantic contacts and networking physically possible for the first time in human history. 3 As a result, the informal alliance came to play an important role in the difficult process of adjustment to the fundamental shift in power relations between the new world and the old. Some of the organizations in the informal alliance were continental Eu ropean undertakings, whereas others were transatlantic or bilateral in nature; some focused on cultural or political issues, while others brought to - gether defense intellectuals or economists. What united them was that they operated transnationally and that their members broadly shared a global mindset : the belief that the nations of the ‘Free World,’ after two devastating world wars and facing a wide range of global challenges, could not confront the modern world in isolation. Needless to say, the exact nature and meth - ods of cooperation – from world government to Atlantic union, from eco - nomic functionalism to political federalism – remained the subject of much debate and disagreement. 4 The Bilderberg Group was one of the first organizations of the infor - mal alliance. Its main purpose was to improve and solidify relations be - tween Western Europe and the United States through secret, non-partisan discussions. 5 The Bilderberg Group’s private nature and its high caliber,"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Introduction 3 mu ltifaceted membership made it an ideal platform for engaging in infor - mal diplomacy and for developing transnational connections . The Bilderberg Group was unique not just in inviting participants from virtually all NATO members (as well as some of the neutral European states) for its yearly meet - ings but also in bringing together a surprisingly broad range of participants representing various political groupings, trade unions, the business and fi - nancial world, civil society, and government. Despite its secretive nature, Bilderberg in fact contributed to a democratization and broadening of the transatlantic foreign policy elite in the 1950s and 1960s. Its organizers were convinced that international understanding would only take hold if as many societal groups as possible were represented. Given the immense imbalance in power between the United States and Europe in the immediate postwar period, the history of transatlantic re - lations is often written through the lens of American agency, hegemony, or empire. The term Americanization, for example, implicitly posits a one- di rectional flow of influence and power. The history of the Bilderberg Group suggests, however, that the actual dynamics of transatlantic relations were much more complex, and that American primacy was not as straightfor - ward as it seemed. US leadership of the alliance, after all, depended upon a certain level of support from European publics and foreign policy elites. This became clear as soon as Western Europe started to recover econom - ically in the early 1950s and a wave of anti-American sentiment swept the continent in the wake of the Korean War and McCarthyism. Believing that transatlantic cooperation was in jeopardy, this wave of anti-Americanism prompted Joseph H. Retinger, Bilderberg’s Polish-born founding father, to create a new type of forum for informal transatlantic exchanges. 6 He argued that “private initiatives” would be more successful than public diplomacy because Europeans were “tired of official [American] prop ag a nd a.” 7 The Bilderberg Group, in other words, was not an American invention – the group was based on a decidedly European initiative and, though it soon turned into a transatlantic organization, its leadership and direction would continue to come predominantly from Europe. The story of how the Bilderberg Group, despite initial American reluc - tance to cooperate, became one of the most important bodies of the in - formal alliance reveals much about the dynamics of transatlantic relations during the Cold War and provides new answers to the question why, despite its frequent crises, the Atlantic alliance turned out to be resilient as well as enduring. This book tells that story in different ways, focusing more on the political than on the economic dimensions of the Bilderberg discussions. It relates, first of all, the history of Bilderberg’s founding and its institu - tional development. Who organized the Bilderberg meetings? How were they financed? Who set the agenda and sent out the invitations? Why did the Bilderberg Group continue to meet even after European anti-Americanism seemed to have subsided in the late 1950s? And how did the group change over time?"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"4 Introduction A se cond, closely intertwined storyline examines how the manifold con - nections between members of the transatlantic elite led to new modes of communication and a sense of shared, transnational, or global identity. 8 It traces the ideas, values, interests, and emotions that united as well as di - vided the members of this elite. This can provide us with important insights into how members of the informal alliance perceived and responded to chal - lenges of the Cold War, decolonization, and globalization. Fi nal ly, Informal Alliance interweaves the narrative of the Bilderberg Group and the transatlantic elite with the broader history of transatlantic relations, thus bringing in a new perspective that has largely remained out of view because of the dominant state-based historiographies. To a consid - erable degree, this history was one of crisis and failure – from the European Defense Community (EDC) to the Suez and Sputnik crises, or to the French withdrawal from NATO’s integrated military command structure in 1966. An important function of the informal alliance was therefore to keep the basic consensus underlying the institutions of Western cooperation alive as well as to search for new avenues of cooperation. From the American point of view, meanwhile, the informal alliance provided opportunities to legiti - mize US leadership, as long as a more equal Atlantic partnership remained elusive. Throughout these different storylines, the question of the Bilderberg Group’s influence emerges. I argue that this influence was mainly indirect. The historical record shows that the Group was not involved in decision- ma king, nor were any specific, actionable conclusions reached. However, the Bilderberg organizers did hope and expect that through the agency of the Bilderberg participants, the discussions would have an impact on decision-makers and public opinion. They did not hesitate to bring the results of their discussions to the attention of government officials and political leaders, yet they had little control over what was done with this information. The actual power of the Bilderberg Group hence mainly consisted of in - troducing new ideas, sustaining a sense of community among the members of the transatlantic elite, and enhancing understanding for differences in at - titudes and political cultures – in short, indirect influence . As the Bi lderberg organizers themselves realized, such influence was impossible to measure with any precision. Ultimately, it depended both on how the Bilderberg participants influenced each other and on what they did with the informa - tion, impressions, and contacts gathered at the Bilderberg meetings. For the Bi lderberg participants themselves, meanwhile, the meetings were useful as a source of information, connections, and status. Of course, they could also be interesting and enjoyable; the atmosphere of the meetings was a key in - gredient for their success. Informal Alliance is the first research-based history of the Bilderberg Group. Although much has been written about Bilderberg, most of it is highly speculative and very little is based on actual archival research. 9 One"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Introduction 5 ex planation for the surprising lack of serious research about the group is that Bilderberg’s official archives were long closed, governed by a 50-year access rule (meaning that for this book I have been able to access all material up to 1967). In addition, the fact that Bilderberg’s membership was so diverse makes the group challenging to study. Even after multilingual archival re - search in dozens of private and official collections in more than 40 archives in seven different countries, this book inevitably provides only a partial view. The main geographic focus of Informal Alliance lies on the United States, Great Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, and the Ne therlands, which means that countries such as Denmark, Greece, Italy, Sweden, or Turkey do not get as much attention as they deserve. The wealth of material in the Bilderberg archives and in a range of other collections does make it possible to write a detailed history of the Bi lderberg Group and its role in transatlantic relations in the period until 1968. Pa rticularly, the first three Bilderberg conferences (one in 1954 and two in 1955) are well documented because verbatim transcripts of these conferences are available. Official reports exist for all other conferences; although these detailed summaries of the discussions do not identify the names of most speakers, it is oftentimes possible to reconstruct who said what by combining the reports with the private notes and correspondence of participants. 10 Many participants, moreover, wrote accounts of the meet - ings for official or private purposes, adding more evidence for analyzing Bilderberg’s indirect influence. 11 Informal Alliance combines a chronological with a thematic approach. The first three chapters examine the origins of the Bilderberg Group. The first chapter begins with the fascinating story of how the penniless London- ba sed Polish writer Joseph Retinger turned into an influential informal dip - lomat who stood at the origins not just of the Bilderberg Group but also of the European Movement. It then addresses the question of US involvement in funding the European Movement against the background of the Cold War. The second chapter shows how Retinger assembled a leading group of Europeans to analyze Europe’s anti-American turn in the early 1950s and how this led to the first Bilderberg conference. It demonstrates that the Bilderberg Group was a decidedly European creation and that, in fact, the Eisenhower Administration was initially reluctant to support Retinger’s initiative. Chapter 3 concludes the first part of the book and gives a detailed ac - count of the first conference held at Hotel de Bilderberg in May 1954. This conference represented a new phase in postwar transatlantic relations as Eu rope’s most immediate dependence on the United States slowly receded. The su ccess of the first Bilderberg conference had much to do, I argue, with the emerging global mindset of an expanding foreign policy elite in the West. The chapter also shows how emotions turned out to be an impor - tant category of analysis for understanding the transatlantic alliance and its anti- co mmunist underpinnings."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"6 Introduction Ch apter 4 takes a step back from the chronological approach and looks more closely at the Bilderberg Group’s organization and membership. It addresses the question of influence and elaborates the concepts of infor - mal diplomacy, the transatlantic elite, and the informal alliance. Taking Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski as two prominent examples, it also shows how the informal alliance allowed relative outsiders to become influential members of the transatlantic elite. Chapter 5 returns to the Bilderberg story and looks at how the Bilderberg Group responded to the failure of the EDC in August 1954. The Bilderberg discussions on European integration provide an important correction to existing explanations of the creation of the European Communities. They show that anti-communist motivations played a much larger role than is often recognized and they underline the profoundly interconnected nature of the many political and socioeconomic motives and interests on which the 1957 Rome Treaties were based. Chapter 6 turns to the topic of decolonization and asks why the so-called colonial question continued to bedevil transatlantic relations throughout the 1950s, culminating in the 1956 Suez crisis. A mixture of different cul - tural attitudes, emotions, Cold War pressures, and divergent national in - terests are part of the answer. At the same time, the emerging global Cold War forced the transatlantic elite to grapple with questions of economic and political development, as well as with the strong wish of many newly inde - pendent nations not to be drawn into the East-West conflict. Chapter 7 deals with a problem that essentially remained unsolved: the question of nuclear strategy and control within NATO. It shows that the Bilderberg meetings provided an important platform for the dissemination of expertise and strategic thinking on nuclear issues and a key venue for transnational criticism of the Eisenhower Administration’s doctrine of mas - sive retaliation. This became all the more important after the Sputnik shock of 1957 exposed the increasing vulnerability of the American mainland to Soviet nuclear attack. Chapter 8 examines how the Bilderberg Group responded to President de Gaulle’s return to power in 1958. The discussions about the relationship between the Inner Six of the European Communities – now united in a com - mon market – and the rest of Europe uncovered disturbing challenges to the internationalist consensus of the informal alliance. The debate about the Kennedy Administration’s ideas about a NATO defense strategy of flex - ible response provided further confirmation that nationalism (primarily in the shape of Gaullism) had returned to the European mainstream. The Bi lderberg meetings reveal how the debate about the future of transatlan - tic relations became a struggle between competing concepts of how nations should cooperate. Chapter 9 analyzes how this struggle culminated in the transatlantic crisis of 1963 (when President de Gaulle vetoed Great Britain’s admission to the European Communities) and how it triggered a process of renewal within"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Introduction 7 th e Bilderberg Group itself. This process received further impetus from the Vietnam War, the rise of Goldwater conservatism in the United States, and the global upsurge of youth and student movements. The conclusion returns to the question of the wider significance of the Bilderberg Group and the informal alliance in the history of transatlantic relations and attempts to explain why the Bilderberg Group has become a favorite object of so many conspiracy theories.

During his lifetime, opinions about Retinger ran the gamut from hero to traitor. His friends nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize and Denis de Rougemont called him the “spiritual fa - ther” and “midwife” of the Council of Europe. 1 Paul-Henri Spaak, himself one of Europe’s founding fathers, described him as one of the “pioneers of Europe.” 2 In stark contrast, his enemies accused him of being a secret agent for the British, the Soviets, the Mexicans, or the Jesuits. The fact that Retinger’s detractors have frequently tainted him with the brush of conspiracy is understandable, as we shall see, but it has had the unfortunate effect of deflecting attention from his real accomplishments and his innovative approach to international relations. Based on the ex - isting evidence, the judgment on Retinger’s more controversial activities – pa rticularly during the two world wars – remains undecided. Yet very little credible evidence has emerged to substantiate accusations of spying and dubious loyalties. Retinger’s preferred methods of operation partly explain the abundance of conspiracy theories about him. Retinger’s métier was informal diplo - macy . 3 He never ran for public office, he held few official positions, and he lacked a traditional power base. His diplomatic tools consisted of high-level connections, a talent for personal persuasion, and the occasional bottle of vodka. He was at his most effective outside of the limelight, and he preferred operating in the dining rooms of Europe’s finest restaurants and hotels. His footprint in the diplomatic archives is correspondingly small. 4 Arguably, however, his impact on both transatlantic relations and European integra - tion was greater than that of many leading politicians and diplomats of his time. The reason for this was that Retinger’s talent for informal diplomacy was particularly well suited to the fast changing post-1945 world of globali - zation, technological change, Atlantic alliance, and European integration. Joseph Retinger was born in 1888, the son of a prominent Polish fam - ily in Cracow, Galicia. Galicia was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, but Retinger was raised as a Polish patriot and educated as a cosmopolitan Eu ropean. The struggle for Polish independence was the central political 1 Joseph Retinger – informal d iplomat"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Joseph Retinger – informal diplomat 9 ca use of his life. Retinger studied at the Sorbonne in Paris and received a PhD in literature at the remarkable age of 20. With the help of his wealthy mentor and family friend Count W ł adys ł aw Zamoyski, he became an ac - tive participant in Parisian high society, befriending André Gide, Maurice Ravel, Eric Satie, Francis Poulenc, and a number of influential political fig- ures such as Marquis Boni de Castellane. After further studies in Munich and a brief period back in Cracow as the publisher of a literary review, Retinger moved to London. There he worked for the Polish National Council, a small Galician organization working to advance the cause of Polish independence. Retinger published his first po - litical treatise, an analysis of the relationship between Russia and Poland, and became a close friend of émigré-writer Joseph Conrad. 5 In August 1914, Retinger arranged Conrad’s first return to Poland in 20 years. They used their visits to Cracow and Lviv to discuss Polish independence with religious and political leaders. Then the outbreak of the World War I forced them to make a hasty retreat. Although the details of his journey are sketchy, Retinger ended up in a French prison, having to rely on Count Zamoyski’s contacts to get released. 6 During the war, Retinger embarked on his first major mission as an informal diplomat. Using his access to high-placed British and French politicians such as H. H. Asquith, David Lloyd George, and Georges Clemenceau, as well as bombarding the British Foreign Office with plans for solving the Po lish question – some of them co-authored by Conrad – Retinger convinced London and Paris to allow him to try to negotiate a separate peace with the Habsburg Austro-Hungarian Empire. Supported by Boni de Ca stellane, Prince Sixte de Bourbon, Lord Northcliffe (the British publisher of The Times ), and leading Catholic officials, Retinger traveled back and forth between Paris, London, and Switzerland. In his memoirs, Retinger admits to the naïveté of these efforts given the complexities of the Polish situation. Different Polish factions and parties regarded him as too pro-Austrian or suspected him of being an agent for Britain or the Vatican. Conrad, however, expressed his admiration for Retinger’s “... brilliant piece of work [...] as an unofficial intermediary between the British and French Gove r n m e nt s.” 7 The collapse of Retinger’s efforts in 1917 left him severely depressed. His marriage dissolved, he started a disastrous affair with the American adven - turess Jane Anderson, and he apparently even made a half-hearted suicide attempt. 8 Meanwhile, his opposition to the creation of a Polish exile army in France – which would destroy his hopes of solving the Polish question with the help of Austria – made him persona non grata in Great Britain and France. British diplomat Harold Nicolson noted in September 1918 that Retinger was likely “an international spy.” 9 Despite the failure of Retinger’s informal diplomacy during the Great War, his remarkable talent for persuasion and gaining access to decision-making elites stands out, particularly considering his relative youth (he turned 26 in"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"10 Joseph Retinger – informal diplomat 1 914). In terms of strength of personality and relentlessness in pursuit of new ideas and solutions, Retinger resembled another young European first cata - pulted to prominence during the war: the Frenchman Jean Monnet. Several decades later, their paths would cross in the struggle to unite Europe. Immediately after World War I, Retinger acted as an advisor to the rev - olutionary government in Mexico. His role in opposing American oil com - panies operating in Mexico landed him in a series of American prisons in 1921. 10 A young American intelligence officer named J. Edgar Hoover noted that Retinger might have been a German spy during the war. 11 At some point, Retinger returned to London, married Stella Morel, the daughter of the leftist political philosopher E. D. Morel, and continued his involve - ment in Polish affairs. One of his political friends in this period was General W ł adys ł aw Sikorski, who had served briefly as Poland’s prime minister in the 1920s. In addition, Retinger was involved in the work of the interna - tional trade unions movement. 12 1940–1945: Wartime diplomacy and the European idea The outbreak of World War II propelled Retinger back onto the international stage. In June 1940, as German tanks rolled towards Paris, he convinced the British Air Ministry – probably with support from Prime Minister Winston Churchill – to provide him with a plane to rescue Ge neral Sikorski from the South of France. 13 Retinger succeeded in bringing Sikorski to London, where the general immediately met with Churchill. As soon as Sikorski be - came head of the Polish government-in-exile, he named Retinger his dip - lomatic counselor. In this function, Retinger maintained contacts with the British government and played a key role in negotiating the controversial Polish-Soviet Agreement of July 1941, acting as a translator during the many meetings between Sikorski and Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden. Retinger then briefly served as the first Polish chargé d’affaires in Moscow. Despite the fact that the 1941 agreement obliged Stalin to free all Polish prisoners- in -arms in the Soviet Union, many exiled Poles, united in their hatred of Russia, strongly opposed it. The upheavals of war set off a global rethinking regarding the nature and future of international relations. New ideas about sovereignty, security, na- tionalism, and international cooperation found their way into the Atlantic Charter and a number of resistance manifestos in Europe and the colonial world. Wartime London, above all, served as a fertile breeding ground for new ideas, and Retinger was one of the central drivers of change. 14 In order to safeguard Poland’s future independence and security, he proposed to es - tablish regional blocs with the ultimate aim of a federated Europe. As he put it in his memoirs: In my frequent conversations with General Sikorski before the War, I pointed out the advantages for Poland of a federated Europe, and the"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Joseph Retinger – informal diplomat 11 im possibility for a small country like Poland to live surrounded by jeal - ous neighbours, since she would be unable to withstand any pressure that might be brought to bear on her by the two big Powers nearest her, Russia and Germany. 15 In early 1941, Sikorski and Retinger initiated regular meetings with rep - resentatives of several other small European powers to discuss future co - operation. The Belgians – represented by Foreign Minister Paul-Henri Spaak, Marcel-Henri Jaspar, and Paul van Zeeland – were the first to show a strong interest in regional federations. The Czechoslovakian leadership, represented by Jan Masaryk, soon joined. By the fall of 1942, Si korski and Retinger had set up an Inter-Allied Committee on postwar issues for the Po lish, Belgian, Dutch, Greek, Norwegian, and Czechoslovakian governments- in -exile. Retinger was the linchpin of these efforts. As Spaak remembered in his memoirs: An intelligent, active and slightly mysterious individual, he would have luncheon every day with one British politician or another, or with a member of one of the governments in exile. He knew everybody and no door was closed to him. 16 Retinger’s initiative gave an important boost to the idea of Europe during the war. One indirect result was the postwar Benelux Union, which Spaak had first discussed with Eelco van Kleffens, the Dutch foreign minister, and Pieter Kerstens, the Dutch minister of trade, at Retinger’s table. 17 Another result was that, as Retinger put it in his memoirs, [t]he Foreign Ministers’ meetings, although not publicized, created great interest in Great Britain and America. One of the Americans par - ticularly interested was Mr. John Foster Dulles [....]. I remember spend - ing several hours with him and discussing not only Polish affairs, but also the general idea of the unity of Europe. 18 The British, however, were afraid of anything that risked complicating their difficult relationship with the Soviet Union. Because the Polish plans were clearly directed not only against future German aggression, but also against possible Soviet meddling in Central European affairs, Soviet dip - lomats communicated Moscow’s concerns to London. As a result, Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden repeatedly warned General Sikorski about the im - plications of his proposals in terms of relations with the Soviet Union and refused to give strong British support. 19 As part of their efforts to win support for the Polish government-in-exile and the Polish resistance, Retinger and Sikorski traveled to Washington, D.C. in March 1942. Despite his earlier dealings with American law enforce - ment, Retinger managed to meet with a number of influential members of"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"12 Joseph Retinger – informal diplomat t he Roosevelt Administration, including W. Averell Harriman and Adolf Berle Jr. In Retinger’s telling, his discussions with Berle resulted in a phone call to President Roosevelt and the promise of $12 million in annual assis - tance to the Polish resistance. Two weeks after their return to London, the American Ambassador to Poland, Anthony Drexel Biddle Jr., showed up with a suitcase containing the first 2 million in cash. 20 Following General Sikorski’s death in a plane crash in July 1943, Retinger lost much of his influence in the Polish government-in-exile. His conserva - tive enemies resurrected old spying stories and suggested that he was a Soviet agent. Despite these attempts to discredit him, in late 1943 Retinger man - aged to persuade the new Polish Prime Minister, Stanis ł aw Miko ł ajczyk, to send him on a secret mission to Poland for discussions with the Polish under - ground. Retinger felt that he could be useful in establishing closer contacts between the government-in-exile in London and local Polish resistance lead - ers in order to plan for Poland’s future. He also felt that these leaders needed to be convinced of the need for cooperation with Soviet forces once the Red Army had crossed the Polish border. This was a highly fraught issue given the revelation, earlier in 1943, of the Katyn massacre and the subsequent breaking-off of relations between Moscow and the Polish government- in- e xile. Retinger felt, however, that the Polish should be pragmatic, par - ticularly in view of the fact that the British were unlikely to support any anti-Soviet action taken by the Polish underground or government-in-exile. Prime Minister Miko ł ajczyk told Marek Celt, the young Polish officer chosen to accompany Retinger, that Retinger was the right man for the mission because “he has a lot of important English friends; they trust him, they’ll believe without reservation whatever he tells them about the state of the Underground in Poland.” 21 Of course, Retinger’s closeness to British decision-makers also meant that anything he heard from the Polish under - ground would likely be shared with the British government. Miko ł ajczyk did not believe that Retinger was a British agent, but he did order Celt to warn the Polish resistance leadership not to tell Retinger anything they did not want the British to hear. 22 British historians Stephen Dorril and Norman Davies have interpreted Retinger’s airdrop over Poland in April 1944 as proof that he was indeed a British agent, employed by the Special Operations Executive (SOE), yet they provide no evidence for their claims. 23 It is far more likely that Retinger, supported by Miko ł ajczyk, used his excellent connections with SOE – whose director, Major-General Colin Gubbins, had been deeply involved in Po lish affairs and considered Retinger a friend – to organize the jump over Po lish territory. Moreover, because of the crucial role the British government would play in any postwar settlement, Retinger closely coordinated his plans with the Foreign Office. 24 A recent study of Retinger’s mission based on British Foreign Office re - cords confirms that it was Retinger who approached Frank Roberts, the acting head of the Foreign Office’s Central Bureau, and Anthony Eden to"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Joseph Retinger – informal diplomat 13 wi n their support. Eden was hesitant at first because he did not “entirely trust M. Retinger.” However, Roberts managed to convince his superiors that Retinger’s mission served a useful purpose and Eden agreed to meet with Retinger as a result. 25 After the war, Roberts told Harold Ma cmillan that Retinger had played “a helpful and certainly an important role in An glo-Polish relations before and even after General Sikorski’s death. He certainly showed great personal courage in being dropped by parachute into Poland to make a personal report on conditions there.” 26 Retinger’s parachute jump over enemy territory was indeed risky. He was probably the oldest, and certainly the least fit, parachutist of the entire war. Yet he somehow managed to land in Poland without serious injury, met with most of the Polish resistance leadership, and avoided arrest by the Gestapo. He even survived an assassination attempt by opponents within the Polish Home Army, who tried to poison him. 27 Retinger ended up being partly paralyzed, but made it out of Poland alive and immediately briefed Mi ko ł ajczyk and the British government. 28 Retinger and the European Movement During their weeks of waiting in Italy, before weather conditions allowed for their long-distance flight to Poland to proceed, Retinger had told his com - panion Marek Celt that he collected two things: “people and world records.” Even if he joked about his collection of world records – being the youngest Sorbonne PhD graduate was one – he was certainly serious about collecting people. A keen observer of human psychology, Retinger kept a little note - book with “people’s characteristics” and spent much of his time and energy managing his network of friends. 29 One of his admirers, the Italian diplomat Pietro Quaroni, described Retinger’s method as follows: One succumbed to his personality without noticing it, irresistibly. He was steadfast in his friendships, as he was in his dislikes. He inspired confidence. Firstly by his discretion. He was no doubt one of the best- in formed people in the world, and his views on all problems, big and small, were very reliable and realistic, based on concrete data. 30 Or as The Observer put it: He was one of those international figures who have ideas and a genius for finding the means to carry them out. A great joker, he had a cigarette perpetually drooping from his lip, never ate a sausage but seemed to live on whiskey and soda. 31 Access to the right people had been the basis of Retinger’s influence during the war. After the war, he continued to expand his network of contacts and"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"14 Joseph Retinger – informal diplomat f riends, traveling widely across Europe and the United States. His method of informal diplomacy turned out to be particularly well suited to the rapid expansion of transnational organizations working towards a more united Europe in the immediate postwar era. 32 This transnationalization of efforts to integrate Europe opened up new channels of influence for people like Retinger, and he jumped at the opportunity. Retinger publicly outlined his views of a more stable postwar order in Europe during a speech at Chatham House on May 7, 1946. His lifelong goal of Polish independence remained a key concern to him. Having traveled to Poland immediately after the end of the war, Retinger had witnessed the communist takeover of power and had been forced to leave the country. At Chatham House, he warned of the emerging Cold War, arguing that the complacency of some of the Big Powers and the rivalries between them have led to the division, in fact if not in theory, of the Continent into two zones of influence and thus sewn the seed, perhaps, of a much greater conflict. Unless Europe wished to become an “appendage to the Russian empire” or “a free market for Anglo-Saxon expansion,” it had to “create a free Continent, economically cohesive and politically unified.” 33 It is clear that Retinger regarded such a united Europe as a possible ‘third force’ between the Soviet Union and the United States – not in the sense of a neutralist Europe but in the sense of a Europe strong and independent enough to overcome the division of the continent in Soviet and American ‘zones of influence.’ Not long after his Chatham House speech, Retinger met with Paul van Zeeland in Brussels and made plans to create a European League for Ec onomic Cooperation (ELEC). 34 The League aimed to overcome the economic policies of autarky and protectionism, which had dominated Europe in the 1930s. By increasing economic interdependence within Eu rope – with the ultimate aim of one large European market – the organ - izers hoped to pave the way for future political initiatives. Retinger trav - eled throughout Europe to help set up local sections of ELEC. Sir Harold But ler agreed to chair the British section, which also included Re t i nger’s old SOE friend Ma jor-General Colin Gubbins, as well as leading indus - trialists and politicians such as Edward Beddington-Behrens, Ha rold Ma cmillan, Wa l t er La yton, and Peter Thorneycroft. Daniel Se rruys organized the French section and brought in Michel Debré, Edmond Gi scard d’ Estaing, André Voisin, and others. Pieter Kerstens took charge of the Dutch section. Retinger did not want to limit the League’s efforts to Western Europe. He worked hard to involve Eastern European countries as well, but was thwarted by Moscow’s refusal to cooperate. Retinger and Van Zeeland did manage to find considerable backing for ELEC in the United States."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Joseph Retinger – informal diplomat 15 Re tinger found Harriman, who served briefly as US ambassador in London, willing to support him. “As a stateless Pole,” Retinger remembered, I naturally had difficulties in getting an American visa, but Averell Ha rriman was my sponsor and arranged my visit. He strongly believed in European unification and as Secretary of Commerce and later head of the European Co-operation Administration was responsible for the tremendous support the United States gave to this idea. 35 Retinger organized an American section under the chairmanship of Adolf Berle Jr., and a number of prominent bankers and businessmen, including Nelson and David Rockefeller, agreed to join. Retinger was convinced that American support for a united Europe was essential. Accordingly, ELEC’s first public initiative consisted of a pam - phlet and resolution in support of the European Recovery Program (ERP), which General George Marshall had announced in June 1947. The mem - orandum stressed the need for the establishment of a European planning board with executive powers and for the reduction of trade barriers. 36 In the following years, ELEC organized several expert conferences and working groups concerning trade liberalization, currency convertibility, and insti - tutional possibilities for European economic cooperation. 37 ELEC’s studies on convertibility helped lay the groundwork for the creation of the impor - tant European Payments Union in 1950, which did much to stimulate intra- Eu ropean trade. 38 In December 1947, Retinger cofounded the Joint International Committee of the Movements for European Unity, an umbrella organization for ELEC, Churchill’s United Europe Movement (UEM), the Christian Democratic Nouvelles Équipes Internationales (NEI), and several other European or - ganizations. Together with UEM’s Duncan Sandys, Churchill’s son-in-law, Retinger set out to organize the Congress of Europe at The Hague in May 1948. 39 By all accounts, the Congress was a real turning point in Eur opean history. It brought together an impressive group of leading Eur opeans, including Churchill, Spaak, Paul Ramadier, Paul Reynaud, and Konrad Adenauer, and it received wide coverage in the European press. 40 Retinger firmly believed in the importance of influencing public opinion by means of political, intellectual, and cultural elites. In his view, the Congress had succeeded admirably in doing so: “[it] received enormous publicity and the participants, once dispersed, added to it further and confirmed its impact. As a result the idea of Europe was strikingly brought to the attention of public opinion.” 41 In his memoirs, Retinger claimed that “[a]t The Hague we laid the foun - dations for all that was to mark the progress of the European Idea in the next decade.” 42 Even if this was perhaps somewhat of an overstatement, the Congress did agree to a number of important resolutions, which later found expression in the Council of Europe, the European Convention on Human"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"16 Joseph Retinger – informal diplomat R ights, the College of Europe in Bruges, and the European Cultural Center in Geneva. Churchill called the Congress a “milestone,” and in the words of the German historian of European integration Wilfried Loth, “[...] the transnational societal consensus on which the later European Communities would rest had become palpable for the first time.” 43 In the wake of the Congress, the Joint International Committee was changed into the European Movement (EM), with Retinger and Sandys acting as secretary-general and president, respectively, of its international committee, and Spaak, Churchill, Léon Blum (leader of the French social - ists), and Italian Prime Minister Alcide de Gasperi serving as honorary presidents. Retinger and Sandys worked hard to transform the resolutions of The Hague into reality. Retinger personally met with a large number of European prime ministers, presidents, and parliamentary leaders to keep the momentum going. 44 He focused in particular on the governments of the Brussels Treaty powers (France, the United Kingdom and the Benelux countries had signed a defensive pact in 1948), hoping that they would take the lead. In addition, national delegations of the newly formed EM peti - tioned parliaments across Europe to take action. In a letter to Harriman, Retinger emphasized the importance of informal diplomacy. “[P]rivate and independent activities for the Unity of Europe,” he wrote, are extremely important at this stage, as Governments by definition, especially when they are democratic, must be over cautious and rather timid in dealing with great initiatives in the domain of International policy. We obviously want to go further than the Governments can and to pave the way for the effective Unity of Europe. 45 In August 1948, Ramadier agreed to present a proposal drafted by Sandys and Retinger to the French government. 46 As a result, French Foreign Mi nister Robert Schuman officially proposed the creation of a European parliamentary assembly later that year. The British Labour government, however, in what was to become a recurring feature of European negotia - tions, was unwilling to agree to any sharing of sovereignty. Foreign Se cretary Ernest Bevin expressed a preference for intergovernmental modes of coop - eration and countered with a plan for a European ministerial council. Throughout the tricky negotiations that followed, Retinger played an important role as an informal troubleshooter and mediator. One typical episode appears in his memoirs. In October 1948, the Brussels Treaty pow - ers had agreed to form a study group to devise a compromise between the Bri tish and French positions. The study group was chaired by Édouard Herriot and included EM members such as Léon Blum, Paul Reynaud, and Pieter Kerstens; on the British side, Hugh Dalton and Sir Gladwyn Jebb were involved. Before the first official meeting of the study group, Retinger"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Joseph Retinger – informal diplomat 17 de cided to bring the heads of delegations together for an informal lunch in Paris. As he put it, “[...] I thought it would be helpful if a friendly atmos - phere prevailed among the delegates right from the start of these difficult negotiations. In this we succeeded [...].” 47 Other contemporary observers (and, it should be noted, friends of Retinger) confirmed Retinger’s impact. In the words of Pietro Quaroni, It is difficult to imagine all that Retinger did to clear away the stumbling- bl ocks – arranging meetings between the English and the French, coaxing one side, pleading with the other! In one week, I remember, he travelled four times between London and Paris with proposals from one country to the other. And he succeeded. If the great “stars” of Eu rope will forgive me [...] I cannot help feeling that if the Council of Europe got on to its feet, a great deal of credit must go to the modest, silent endeavours of Dr. Retinger. 48 Denis de Rougemont likewise emphasized the importance of Retinger’s in - formal diplomacy, calling him the “midwife of the Council of Europe.” 49 By May 1949, the Brussels Treaty powers, joined by Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Norway, and Sweden, agreed to the creation of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, with a Consultative Assembly responsible to a Committee of Ministers. Greece and Turkey joined three months later, to be followed by Iceland and the Federal Republic of Germany in 1950. Transnational Europe Even if the Council of Europe never fulfilled the initial hopes of Retinger and others, these early steps towards a more united Europe did pave the way for future developments in European integration, including the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) founded in 1950, and the 1957 Rome Treaties establishing the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) and the European Economic Community (EEC). The Congress of Europe, the Consultative Assembly meetings in Strasbourg, and several subsequent large EM conferences all nurtured a new sense of commitment to the idea of uniting Europe, particularly among a number of European leaders who would later play pivotal roles in creating the European Communities. 50 As Paul-Henri Spaak recalled in his memoirs, Between 1949 and 1954 I devoted myself unreservedly to the cause of European unity and wrote a large number of articles in its support. I made speeches in all the member countries of the Council of Europe. This was a time of lively activity and genuine enthusiasm. My friends and I were convinced that we were fighting for a cause that merited our absolute devotion. 51"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"18 Joseph Retinger – informal diplomat H arold Macmillan wrote about his experience in the Consultative Assembly in similar terms: “[...] we met in a real atmosphere of spiritual excitement. We really felt convinced that we could found a new order in the Old World – democratic, free, progressive, destined to restore prosperity and peace.” 52 The result was a vast increase in transnational contacts and the establish - ment of a transnational European public sphere – or, to use Ma cmillan’s phrase, a “sounding board” for Europe. 53 Within this European public sphere, debates about questions such as supranational versus intergovern - mental or political versus economic integration served to crystallize trends and to provide greater clarity on what was achievable and what not. Harry Price, author of an early official history of the Marshall Plan, was one of the first to recognize this: “[The Council] furnished [...] a useful chan - nel for continuing intergovernmental deliberations on further measures in the direction of political integration. Its chambers served as a forum for the discussion and clarification of the Schuman Plan.” 54 Another case in point was the deeply entrenched British (and Scandinavian) reluctance to commit to the sharing of sovereignty, which became apparent during the long dis - cussions at Strasbourg and which convinced many continental European leaders by late 1951 to concentrate on the Europe of the Six in the hope of bringing the United Kingdom in later. When the British Conservatives returned to power in October 1951 and turned out not to be any more will - ing to engage in supranational adventures than their Labour predecessors – de spite Churchill’s important contributions to the EM – people like Spaak resolved to focus their efforts on ‘little Europe.’ A further critical feature of the EM and the Council of Europe was that they transcended not just borders but also political parties and ideological divides. To Retinger, nonpartisanship came naturally; he routinely dealt with political leaders from all sections of the political spectrum. But it remains an interesting peculiarity of European integration that both the ECSC and the Rome Treaties were created by politicians who would not normally have sat comfortably at the same table. Two of the main architects of the Rome Treaties, Konrad Adenauer and Guy Mollet, for example, were a conserva - tive German Christian Democrat and a left-wing French socialist. 55 The early phase of European integration had given politicians such as these opportu - nities to get to know each other, or, at least, to know where others stood on the question of supranational European cooperation. Thus, they developed a greater sensibility for each other’s standpoints and backgrounds. The relative seclusion of Strasbourg – which did not have a large interna - tional airport – meant that the long Assembly sessions forced participants to spend much time together. As Macmillan remembered: In Strasbourg there were few distractions. We lived together in the As sembly or its committees during many working hours. In our leisure, we shared an agreeable atmosphere of social recreation and informal discussion. During the three years that I sat on this body I got to know almost every distinguished personality in Europe. 56"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Joseph Retinger – informal diplomat 19 As i t happened, many of the connections and friendships forged in the As - sembly and in the EM would later play an important part in the Bilderberg meetings. In a similar way, the EM brought together a large number of private or - ganizations and figures from different societal backgrounds, including reli - gious organizations, trade unions, youth groups, and other non-state actors. Retinger called this the “Europe of the people,” and, in the words of John Pomian, attached great importance to it, for it was in keeping with his under - standing of the process of history. Religious, cultural, economic and social forces are more stable than the often ephemeral political ones and in the long run equally, if not more, effective in shaping the course of events. 57 Retinger remained secretary-general of the EM until April 1952. 58 In this pe - riod, he helped set up the European Youth Campaign (EYC) and was deeply involved in the work of the European Cultural Center in Geneva. He also remained active in the Eastern and Central European Commission within the EM, which he had set up with Macmillan with the aim of keeping the European nations beyond the Iron Curtain involved in European affairs. 59 In the first half of 1950, moreover, Retinger was deeply involved in the cri- sis of leadership concerning Duncan Sandys. Sandys’ leadership at the EM was criticized as ‘dictatorial’ and his reluctance to keep pace with federalist plans led to resentment on the part of continental organizations such as the Union of European Federalists (UEF). In late summer, Sandys agreed to step aside, and Spaak, assisted by Retinger, took over the helm at the EM. 60 American connections In the summer of 1948, Retinger and Sandys had traveled to New York City to gain US backing for the new movement. They succeeded in convincing Allen Dulles, the wartime Swiss director of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), to support the EM. At the time, Dulles had been involved in set - ting up a committee to support Count Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi ’s Eu - ropean federalist organization, but the success of the Congress of Europe induced him to shift his support to the EM. Dulles and George Franklin Jr., the director of the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) , were instrumental in creating the American Committee on United Europe (ACUE) in early 1949. 61 General William Donovan, former head of the OSS, was willing to become its chairman. Franklin served as secretary of ACUE, and Ge neral Donovan convinced Thomas Braden, another former OSS op - erative with close ties to the European resistance movements, to become AC UE’s executive director. ACUE’s list of board members reads like a ‘who’s who’ of the US state- pr ivate network engaged in responding to the escalating Cold War. 62 Among"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"20 Joseph Retinger – informal diplomat t he people involved were General Lucius D. Clay, David Dubinsky, Arthur Goldberg, George Nebolsine, General Walter Bedell Smith, Charles M. Spofford, and Arnold J. Zurcher. A number of ACUE members ended up serving in important positions at the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) after Smith became its director in October 1950. Smith recruited Dulles to become Deputy Director for Plans, and in 1951 Dulles asked Braden to join the agency as well. The ACUE served two functions. First, it engaged in a range of public and lobbying activities to win support for European unity in the United States. Se cond, the ACUE responded to an urgent request for financial support by Sandys with a fund-raising campaign set off by a speech and dinner with Churchill in March 1949. 63 Initially, the ACUE relied on private contributions from wealthy supporters, such as Max Ascoli, the publisher of The Reporter ; Nelson and David Rockefeller; and Walter Washington. The Rockefeller Bro thers Fund also contributed $10,000 in August 1950. 64 In the period from February 1949 to October 1951, the ACUE raised a little over $200,000 in pri- vate contributions, about half of which had been passed on directly to a number of Eu ropean organizations, including the EM. 65 The French-based European Council of Vi gilance was another major recipient. At some point, the US gov - ernment stepped in to provide more substantial funding for the EM’s EYC. 66 Although the details of the Truman Administration’s financial support for the EM remain murky, many historians have jumped to the conclusion that ACUE was in fact a CIA front organization. The first account of CIA fund - ing for the EM emerged in a sensationalist article published by the British magazine Time Out in 1975 in the midst of a British referendum campaign on EEC membership. 67 The only source for the article was a decade- old dissertation on the early years of the EM written by F. X. Rebattet, the son of EM official Georges Rebattet. In the 1990s, the British historian Ri chard Aldrich picked up the trail and published several influential articles on ACU E. 68 Although Aldrich uncovered valuable new information based on his extensive research in US archives, the Rebattet dissertation again turned out to be the main source for his far-reaching claims about ACUE’s CIA connections. As Aldrich put it, “[...] it is the remarkable work of Rebattet, with unparalleled access to European Movement documentation, that con - firms that most ACUE funds originated with the CIA.” 69 Rebattet’s dissertation, in fact, does no such thing. Based solely on Eu ropean archives, Rebattet’s history of the EM argues convincingly that the Truman Administration stepped in to provide major funding for mainly the EM’s EYC (£440,080 – around $1,2 million – in the period from May 1951 to May 1953). However, according to Rebattet, “[t]he resources of the European Youth Campaign came from the American Committee on United Europe which acted in this case as a covering organisation for the Am erican State Department .” 70 Aldrich’s claim, moreover, that “[t]he CIA had its greatest impact on the European Movement in 1949 and 1950” is not sup - ported by any documentary evidence. 71"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Joseph Retinger – informal diplomat 21 A mo re likely timeline, supported by evidence from the EM archives, ACUE records, and official US documents, suggests that secret US govern - ment funding did not start until late 1951, when the EYC, which had been founded in the summer of 1951, really got going. 72 During the first half of 1951, the ACUE’s financial support for the EM remained fairly limited. As Braden told Georges Rebattet in March 1951, total ACUE funding for the EM from August 1950 to August 1951 was projected to be $25,000, a rela- tively modest amount compared to the $1,2 million provided for the EYC in a two-year period. 73 ACUE funding for the EM picked up during the second half of the year and totaled $61,011 for 1951 as a whole. 74 Moreover, in 1952, the year that the EYC picked up steam, Spaak decided that funds from American sources that had previously been used wholly for the ordinary budget of the International Secretariat of E.M. because they were only a small part of total receipts, would in future be used for specific activities for which special budgets would be opened outside the ordinary budget of E.M. 75 The “secret State Department funds” mentioned by Rebattet were in all likelihood Marshall Plan counterpart funds, which were used by both the Eu ropean Cooperation Agency (ECA) and by the Office of Policy Co ordination (OPC), an independent outfit within the CIA engaged in cov - ert psychological warfare and paramilitary operations. 76 Pomian suggests as much in Retinger’s memoirs, and Retinger indeed worked with ECA officials on a number of projects. 77 In early 1951, for example, Retinger told Braden that he had met with Roscoe Drummond, the director of ECA’s European Information Division in Paris, “and fi - nally arranged the way they will help on our publications on European u n it y.” 78 A few weeks later he asked Braden to “tell the General that Roscoe Dr ummond is working very loyally and very helpfully with us to the satis - faction, I hope, of both parties.” 79 Further evidence for ECA’s involvement comes from an early official history of American psychological warfare, which shows that the “ECA also sponsored national youth movements to counter Communist success in this field. In 1950, a European youth organi - zation was fostered to counter-balance the proposed Communist Youth fes - tival for Berlin in 1951.” 80 Of course, ECA, OPC, CIA, and other agencies worked closely together on these matters. As early as February 1949, Retinger had asked his wartime friend Anthony Drexel Biddle Jr. to arrange a meeting at the CIA. Biddle told CIA Director Roscoe Hillenkoetter that as secretary-general of the EM, Retinger had “excellent contacts.” Retinger met with the deputy direc - tor of the CIA and it was noted that he had “a suggested plan which may be of interest to OSO [the Office of Special Operations] and/or OPC.” 81 It is unclear whether the CIA took any action, but a year later, in Fe bruary 1950, the head of OPC, Frank Wisner, discussed “Dr. Rettinger [sic] and European"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"22 Joseph Retinger – informal diplomat u nion” with Hillenkoetter and requested “for permission to brief Harriman et a l.” 82 Hillenkoetter asked the FBI to check for a file on “R ettinger,” and was told there was none. Wisner then informed W. Averell Harriman, ECA’s Special Re presentative in Europe: “we are presently working on an overall project that will seek to promote Western European political integration with ECA support.” Wi sner asked for Harriman’s guidance on which organizations or individ - uals to support. Harriman made clear that in his opinion, the EM was “by far the most effective organ for promoting the political union of Europe” and that Coudenhove-Kalergi’s group was “practically non-existent.” Yet Wi sner worried that pinning all hopes on the EM might backfire and men - tioned the possibility of supporting people like the pro-European British Labour party member Ronald MacKay and member organizations of the EM like the European Union of Federalists, ELEC, the Nouvelles Équipes Internationales , and the Socialist Movement for the United States of Europe. As Wisner put it, “were we to select the European Movement as the single instrument through which to support unity, would we not risk of confirm - ing the domination of the unity movement by those advocating a slow ap - proach to the problem?” Wisner clearly favored a more federalist approach and noted that the EM was “dominated for the most part by those, including some prominent Britains [sic], who advocate the functional (slow and step- by-step) approach to unity.” 83 Harriman’s response is unknown, but it seems likely that he shared Wisner’s views and no immediate action was taken. After it became clear that Spaak would take over from Sandys in the sum - mer of 1950, however, these concerns no longer weighed as heavily. “Be tween us,” Braden now told Dulles, General Donovan and I talked with Mr. Harriman, Mr. Katz and Roscoe Drummond. When we told them the news about Spaak, they thought that E.C.A. would be prepared to give help previously withheld because of concern over the leadership of the Movement. 84 It wasn’t until early 1951, however, that Spaak and Retinger had a new sec - retariat in Brussels fully up and running. 85 In addition to his contacts with ECA and OPC/CIA officials, Retinger decided to ask the US High Commissioner for Germany (HICOG) John Mc Cloy for support for a youth campaign. 86 As High Commissioner, Mc Cloy controlled Marshall Plan funds in Germany and was deeply involved in psy - chological warfare operations. 87 In early 1951, one of his top concerns was the upcoming World Youth Festival in East Berlin, a massive undertaking bringing together 1.5 million young people over the summer. 88 The American response to the World Youth Festival is important for understanding why the Truman Administration decided to support Retinger’s plans for a EYC. Initially, HICOG and OPC operations in Germany had predominantly consisted of paramilitary training and stay-behind organizations, but after"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Joseph Retinger – informal diplomat 23 th e outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, a larger campaign of cov - ert political and psychological warfare commenced. 89 One key aim of this campaign was to strengthen anti-communist organizations and attitudes in Germany and Europe. OPC and HICOG activities ranged from sending the Boston Philharmonic on a trip through Europe to giving financial support to non-communist trade unions, political parties, student organizations, and the Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF). 90 One of OPC’s largest oper - ations was the funding, through the National Committee for a Free Europe, of Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe, with their European headquar - ters in Munich. 91 The importance of the Korean War as a turning point for the United States’ psychological warfare strategy is evident in HICOG files. 92 Tw o months after the outbreak of the conflict, McCloy reported to the State De partment: “[the] entire HICOG headquarters has been devoting major ef - forts and attention to up-swelling anti-Soviet campaign [...]” As part of this campaign, he wrote, US officials were working with “publishers and other civic leaders, including youth and women leaders, with [a] view to strength - ening [the] German anti-Communist propaganda effort.” 93 European unity now turned out to be an attractive theme for US anti- co mmunist propaganda. A united Europe stood for peace, economic pro - gress, and freedom; it allowed for a positive anti-communist message and the kind of “program for positive Western objectives” that McCloy wanted. Recently declassified CIA documents show that a number of covert US op - erations in Germany in the early 1950s indeed focused on European unity. One recipient of American funds was the German Europa Union , a mem - ber of the EM. 94 Another was the Gesellschaft Freies Europa , an organi - zation close to the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) of Germany and headed by Chancellor Konrad Adenauer’s public relations chief Otto Lenz. A briefing for CIA Director Walter Bedell Smith made clear that financing for the Ge sellschaft was “part of campaign to bring favourable notice of the Sc human Plan to every level of German life [...]” 95 European unity was particularly appealing to a young generation that had grown up in times of war and economic devastation. 96 Therefore, Eur ope played a major role in HICOG’s response to the youth rally in East Berlin in the summer of 1951. McCloy reported that In addition to Europa Zug and Marshall Plan exhibit at ERP pavilion, ECA will definitely: (a) Feature free films in George C. Marshall House, (b) distribute 200,000 copies each of satirical pamphlet (Wir Brauchen Keinen Marshall Plan) contrasting econ[omic] conditions in [the] Sov[iet] Zone and [the] Fed[eral] Rep[ublic] and of ERP pamphlet on Berlin (Berlin Baut Auf) [...] 97 In addition, McCloy favored holding a plebiscite in Berlin on European unity. Such plebiscites had been organized in several German cities and had received"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"24 Joseph Retinger – informal diplomat m uch positive attention. The Frenchman Jean Moreau, one of the organizers behind this campaign, would later become the first head of the EYC. McCloy was satisfied with the “global campaign to counteract and dis - credit [the] Communist World Youth Festival.” Yet he reported to the State Department and ECA that much more needed to be done. Of the World Youth Festival, he said, It was a mammoth effort and [if ] repeated without any opportunity to counter it, the likelihood that a strong core of youthful adherents will be established by such methods is just as certain as the fact that the Nazis were able to do as much. 98 In this context, it comes as no surprise that Retinger’s plan for a EYC found a receptive audience at HICOG. Meanwhile, Retinger began telling his partners at ACUE of his new focus on Europe’s youth. In March 1951, he informed Braden about plans for a large rally: “we shall have about 50,000 youngsters present and make a re - ally big show out of it.” 99 A few weeks later, Retinger added, I believe that in a few days’ time I shall be able to write you very inter - esting news about our relations with McCloy and Katz [Milton Katz, ECA special representative in Paris] whom we are meeting in a few days. Not long thereafter, the EYC was up and running, and Retinger was back to his familiar role of traveling across Europe to convince governments to support it. 100 Over a period of eight years, the EYC would receive significant US fund - ing, channeled through ACUE, and organize a wide range of conferences, workshops, and other activities. Paul G. Hoffman (who became de facto chairman of ACUE in 1955 as Donovan’s health declined) continued to be - lieve that this support was important in later years. In 1957, he wrote, The European Movement and the Youth Campaign, which have helped keep alive and vibrant the concept of a united Europe, and to which the Committee has contributed the bulk of its funds, have assured a political climate which has made easier the ratification of the Common Market and Euratom treaties. 101 The success of the European Communities finally led to the suspension of ACUE’s activities in 1960. So, what does all this mean for the question of the CIA’s involvement in ACUE and the EM? The answer is both more complex and more speculative than the existing CIA front explanations. 102 The ACUE undoubtedly had ex - cellent connections to the emerging US intelligence world; after all, the CIA recruited some of its top talent from ACUE. But there is no indication that"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Joseph Retinger – informal diplomat 25 AC UE was created by the CIA as a front organization. Moreover, official American backing for EM programs such as the EYC did not start until after the outbreak of the Korean War, and the money likely came from ECA coun - terpart funds. Based on the available evidence, it is difficult to tell where, when, and by whom exactly the decision to support the EYC was made. One possible scenario is that HICOG (McCloy) and ECA (Katz) agreed to pay for the EYC, while OPC was responsible for delivering the money from counter - part funds – known internally as ‘candy’ – to the ACUE. 103 This would tally with Braden’s recollection that one day a banker with the irresistible name of Pinky Johnson showed up at the ACUE offices with $75,000 in cash. 104 It also fits with Wisner’s 1950 memorandum to Harriman describing OPC plans to start promoting European unity with ECA support. ACUE was obviously so closely aligned with the US government that it was willing to go along with any scheme to provide covert funding for the EYC (as well as other special EM campaigns and projects later in the dec - ade). What remains unclear, however, is to what extent – if any – ACUE fo llowed directions from the CIA or other agencies on how to spend the money. Revelations of CIA funding often imply a high level of CIA con - trol over its ‘front organizations.’ Most studies of the Congress for Cultural Freedom have noted, however, that the CIA had little say in its day-to-day business. 105 The EM itself, meanwhile, attempted to separate secret US fi - nancing of the EYC and other campaigns from its regular budget. In fact, the EM struggled to survive financially in the mid-1950s. 106 Retinger did not much care about distinguishing between different US departments and agencies. In typical fashion, he established contact with everyone he deemed capable of helping his cause: with McCloy at HICOG; with Harriman, Drummond, and Katz at ECA; and with Wisner at OPC. Retinger did not mind accepting secret US funds, but he must have been aware of their drawbacks. With the benefit of hindsight, it is evident that the EM made a significant mistake in accepting them – despite the desperate need for funds. Ever since the funding was inevitably exposed, both his - torians and a variety of anti-European conspiracy theorists have used this episode to argue that the CIA played a much larger role in ‘creating Europe’ than the agency in reality did. In addition, ACUE’s assistance came with certain strings attached. Do novan and Braden, for example, were deeply involved in the campaign to replace Sandys with Spaak in 1950. 107 In early 1951, moreover, they aggres - sively pushed the EM to denounce any connection with an Atlantic Union declaration proposed by Count Coudenhove-Kalergi. They explained that US public opinion would not look favorably upon any plans for an Atlantic Union until much more progress was made at the European side. When the EM did not immediately respond, Braden wrote an angry letter to Rebattet, asking “What the hell are you doing about it? Let me know at once.” 108 Such heavy-handed tactics – supported by the implied threat of withholding fur - ther financial support – must have caused resentment on the part of the EM."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"26 Joseph Retinger – informal diplomat B y the spring of 1952, Retinger decided that the EM had lost much of its earlier effectiveness, and he stepped down as secretary-general of the EM’s international committee, although he continued to support the movement as a general delegate. The British blockade against any supranational politi - cal initiatives was an important reason for the EM’s loss of momentum. The realization that Churchill’s return to power had not led to a fundamental change in the British attitude caused much soul-searching on the part of the continental members of the EM. The Schuman Plan and the proposal for a European Defense Community now shifted the focal point of European integration to the Europe of the Six. Retinger believed that the EM had moved too strongly in this direction and was unhappy to witness the weakening of the movement’s national councils in Great Britain and Scandinavia. In a long conversation with Macmillan in early 1952, he explained his concerns. Macmillan’s summary of Retinger’s tour d’ horizon is worth quoting in full: Unless England takes the lead, [Retinger argued,] there will be a gradual weakening of European morale and the will to resist. ... ‘[I]f we [i.e., the British, TWG] take the lead, the British Empire-European bloc can be made independent of American and Russia – a real and beneficent third force. Then a deal can be made and he is convinced that Russia will give in without war – even to the extent of retiring to her frontiers. Nothing could be a greater guarantee to Russia than the emergence of a Europe-Empire group not subservient to America. The Russians are absolutely convinced that Britain and Europe are as much satellite states as her own [...] ‘Churchill understands all this – but is too old to break through the prison of English tradition. Eden understands it no t so well, but he is too ambitious for the succession (the only thing he thinks about) to risk any bold policy. He is a prematurely aged man. He had moments of genius during the war. Now he is very conventional. He is not sure of himself. This is why he is so jealous. He is an aging woman, with a mor - bid fear of any younger or more attractive rival. War is almost certain, unless Britain leads Europe. The Americans have the wealth and the material power – but they have no experience and no patience. Macmillan “thought it a pretty shrewd summary of the world situation – and a pretty frightening one.” 109 In the face of Britain’s continued inaction, Retinger now decided to shift his focus to transatlantic relations. He remained convinced, however, of the overall accomplishments of the EM, writing in 1954: The main achievement of the European Movement and the Movements of which it is composed rests on the fact that the idea of the unity of Europe was lifted from the sphere of Utopian dreams into that of a practical reality. 110"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Joseph Retinger – informal diplomat 27 Lo oking back at the early phase of European integration, there can be little doubt that Retinger’s informal diplomacy made a significant contribution to the lifting of dreams into reality.

Present were Antoine Pinay, the conservative French Prime Minister; Guy Mollet, the leader of the French Socialist Party (SFIO); Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands; Paul van Zeeland, the Belgian Foreign Minister; Hugh Gaitskell, a leading Labour politician and former Chancellor of the Exchequer; Major-General Colin Gubbins; Paul Rijkens, the Dutch chairman of Unilever; Ole Bjørn Kraft, a conservative Danish politician and Minister of Foreign Affairs; Rudolf Mueller, a Frankfurt-based German lawyer; and Panagiotis Pipinelis, the Greek ambassador to NATO. No journalists were told of the gathering, nor could any limousines be seen arriving at the Élysée Palace. Instead, the men slipped quietly into a private apartment on the Rue de L’Assomption. Despite the secrecy, Retinger had not brought this unusual group together to hatch any conspiratorial plots. Instead, he wanted to discuss the worri- some increase in anti-Americanism in many European countries. A corre - sponding rise in “antipathy towards Europe” in the United States troubled him as well, since it might cause the return of US isolationism. 1 Retinger deemed secrecy for the committee necessary because of the controversial subject matter and because of the composition of the group. News of the po - litical rivals Pinay and Mollet meeting in private would have sent the Paris rumor mills into overdrive; Gaitskell, meanwhile, might have faced uncom - fortable questions in his own Labour Party about the company he kept. The discussions in Paris resulted in the writing of a comprehensive re - port on anti-Americanism. Retinger and Prince Bernhard shared this report with a number of influential Americans and suggested that a similar group in the United States should produce a response without delay. Ho wever, de - spite their contacts with a number of high-level officials in the Ei senhower Ad ministration, the Americans were hesitant to cooperate. It wasn’t until the autumn of 1953 that the nonpartisan Committee for a National Trade Policy agreed to formulate an American reaction. As a next step, the Retinger committee decided to organize a high-level European-American conference for informal discussions of the underlying causes of transatlantic tensions. This off-the-record meeting took place at the Hotel de Bilderberg in the Netherlands, May 29–31, 1954. 2 2 Anti-Americanism and the road t o Bilderberg"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"34 Anti-Americanism and the road to Bilderberg T he story of how a small gathering in Paris evolved into the elite Bi lderberg meetings underlines the significance of European anti-Americanism in this period. 3 In telling that story, this chapter shows how older forms of socio - cultural anti-Americanism fused with the more political anti-Americanism of the early Cold War to form a new and powerful mixture that threatened to severely undermine, if not destroy, NATO and the Atlantic alliance. The Eisenhower Administration was deeply worried about this development, while Communist propagandists attempted to ride the anti-American wave in order to thwart US goals in Western Europe. At the same time, this chapter reveals that the founding of the Bilderberg Group was the result of a European initiative; Bilderberg, in other words, was not a creation of the CIA or other US organizations. The fact that the Bilderberg Group was first and foremost a European project reflected a strong current of pro -American Atlanticism in Europe. 4 This Atlanticism, which was part of a broader rise of internationalism on both sides of the At lantic, was grounded in the collective memories of the Treaty of Versailles, the Great Depression, and the subsequent descent into totalitarianism; but also in the years of wartime cooperation, and the American commitment to Europe as expressed in NATO and the Marshall Plan. 5 The inability of the democracies to defend themselves during the 1930s had made the interna - tionalists of the early Cold War all the more determined not to repeat the mistakes of the interwar period. Retinger and his friends summed up Atlanticism in the first sentence of their report: “We [...] are firmly convinced that the security and development of the Western world cannot be achieved unless the friendship and mutual understanding between the United States and Western Europe are main - tained and expanded.” 6 On the other side of the Atlantic, David Ro ckefeller, a Bilderberg member of the first hour, later remembered the sense of moral obligation felt by US internationalists: “Like many in my generation I re - turned from World War II believing a new international architecture had to be erected and that the United States had a moral obligation to provide leadership to the effort.” 7 Retinger’s committee Retinger was well aware of European traditions of cultural anti- Am ericanism. In the spring of 1952, however, he was more concerned about the political con - sequences of a broader rise in anti-American sentiments in many Eu ropean countries. He warned ominously of “a situation of the gravest danger” if no coun - teraction was taken. 8 Retinger soon learned that leading European politicians and businessmen, many of whom he knew through his work in the Eu ropean Movement, shared his concerns and were willing to join his committee. Retinger, in an inspired moment, decided to recruit Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands to chair his committee. As Retinger’s assistant John Pomian later recalled, Retinger saw several advantages in asking Prince Bernhard. 9 "},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Anti-Americanism and the road to Bilderberg 35 A part from the benefit of a royal title, the Prince was well known and re - spected throughout Europe and the United States. During the war, he had earned a reputation as a tireless and creative chief of staff of the Dutch army in exile. As a result, he had many powerful friends in Washington and easy access to the White House. After the war, the Prince had become an effec - tive goodwill ambassador for the Netherlands, traveling to South America, the United States, and Canada to promote Dutch economic interests. The Dutch press started calling him ‘Prince Charming’ and celebrated his suc - cess in securing KLM Royal Dutch Airlines landing rights in Houston. Prince Bernhard spoke fluent English, French, and Dutch, in addition to his native German, and indeed possessed an easy charm and quick intel - ligence that would serve him well as chair of the Bilderberg meetings. He was a strong supporter of European integration and had cohosted the 1948 Co ngress of Europe. He was also active in European cultural affairs, founded the Erasmus Prize, and played a leading role in the Fondation Eu ropéenne de la Culture . The Prince generally resented the constitutional limits to his activities as a member of the royal family and relished every chance to circumvent them. 10 Besides his many admirable qualities, Be rnhard’s love of fast cars, airplanes, and women frequently got him into trouble and re - flected an irresponsible side to his character, which ultimately resulted in the Lo ckheed scandal in 1976 and his resignation as Bilderberg chairman. 11 In addition to the men present at the Paris Meeting in September 1952, Retinger and Prince Bernhard asked three other prominent Europeans to join the committee: Max Brauer, the Social Democratic Party (SPD) mayor of Hamburg; Pietro Quaroni, the Italian Ambassador to France; and Lord Portal of Hungerford, a Barclays Bank director. 12 All members agreed to write a series of reports on anti-Americanism within their respective coun - tries. In Paris, they decided that Retinger would then present a summary of their findings “[...] to Mr. Harriman, so that he might ask some Rep ublican personality to prepare with him another report on the causes of anti- Eu ropean feeling in America.” In addition, [...] the members should take action individually, without disclosing the existence of the Committee. In this connection, it was mentioned that useful work could be accomplished through such organisations as ‘Friends of Atlantic Union’, by informal meetings with editors of news - papers etc. 13 The United States as a ‘European’ power One important conclusion reached by the committee was that the anti- Am ericanism of the early Cold War was, to a large extent, a response to the global power shift that had started in the late 19th century and that had accelerated as a result of the two world wars. As the United States rose to su - perpower status, Europe experienced a parallel decline, with its economies"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"36 Anti-Americanism and the road to Bilderberg r eeling after the devastations of World War II and its colonial empires crumbling. “The United States,” Van Zeeland observed, “is now unques - tionably the richest, most powerful country, exercising hegemonic control over the destiny of the free world. In several ways, the United States have [sic] resumed the role England played during part of the last century.” 14 For the first time in its history, the United States had abandoned the Monroe Doctrine to become a ‘European’ power in peacetime. The initial American impulse to pull out of Europe as quickly as possible in 1945–1946 had given way to a clear commitment to European security embodied by the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, NATO, the Truman Administration’s decision to station four American divisions in Europe, and the Mutual Security Aid (MSA) program. The central paradox of anti-Americanism in Western Europe was that pre - cisely this US commitment to Europe caused widespread concern. 15 In part, this was simply because of the suddenness of the change. “Most of us who collaborate in this Report,” Retinger wrote, “remember the time when the influence of the United States on European politics, economic, financial, or cultural life, was negligible.” 16 Now, Europe struggled to adjust to the lead - ing role played by the United States in European affairs. Tensions and re - sentment were more or less preprogrammed, as the example of Wa sh i ng ton’s insistence on German rearmament after the outbreak of the Korean War showed. Just five years after the end of World War II, many Europeans were not ready to follow the American lead on this controversial issue. 17 Several contributors turned to the metaphor of family relations to explain the psychological implications of this power shift. Hugh Gaitskell wrote in the introduction of his report on anti-Americanism in the United Kingdom that [t]he alliance means we have to try and agree on common policies, that we have in so many ways to try and march together. The process breeds disputes. You have plenty of arguments inside your family, whereas you only nod politely to the people at the other end of the street. 18 Likewise, Prince Bernhard compared the position of the United States with that of an eldest brother who should consult his younger siblings when mak - ing important decisions. 19 Not surprisingly, the committee concluded that the emergence of the United States as the leader of the West caused most resentment in the United Kingdom and France. The United Kingdom had been an equal partner to the United States during the war – in part because of the Ch urchill-Roosevelt relationship – and now had to accept a much inferior position. 20 France, after the humiliation of Vichy, was eager to regain a more independent role in world affairs. The reports by Prince Bernhard on the Netherlands, Va n Ze eland on Belgium, and Kraft on Denmark showed that in these smaller countries, anti-American sentiment was less of a problem. Germany, obviously, remained a special case because of the occupation and its division into East and West."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Anti-Americanism and the road to Bilderberg 37 The European fear of war The committee’s report identified “attitudes towards war” as the most im - portant difference between Europe and America. For most Europeans, the memories of wartime misery and destruction were still too vivid even to consider the possibility of a new war. During the September 25 discussions, Hugh Gaitskell stressed “that in his opinion the most important single cause of friction was the fear of war.” 21 Guy Mollet agreed, writing in his report that “[s]ix years after their liberation, the French people still feel a deep exhaustion and weariness.” 22 Major-General Gubbins likewise concluded that continental Europe was “still largely exhausted” and could not under - stand public discussions in Washington on the prospects of a new world war. The Korean War was judged to have been a key turning point. 23 Mollet pointed to the resulting “fiscal,” “economic,” and “military mobilisation” in the United States. Against the background of the Korean War, rising East-West tensions, and a strong push for European rearmament, belliger - ent statements by “trigger-happy” American generals or congressmen were bound to get a negative reception in Europe, even – or perhaps especially – if they were meant for domestic American consumption. 24 The psychological impact of the Korean War could be observed in a gen- eral coarsening of foreign policy debate in the United States and the rise of McCarthy-style anti-communism. Mollet warned that remarks such as “Let us make haste to crush the USSR while we are the stronger” or “Why aren’t we using the atomic bomb in Korea” caused immense concern in France. 25 Prime Minister Pinay similarly emphasized that France was willing to follow a defensive strategy in the Cold War. Whenever American policies appeared to be aggressive, the non-communist French public became worried. 26 The obvious implication was that public figures in the United States should be more careful in their utterances, or at least should be aware of their prob - able consequences in Europe. Washington, in other words, needed to take into account that the United States was perceived as a relatively inexpe - rienced and volatile player on the world scene. 27 Retinger himself had told Ha rold Ma cmillan in January that the Americans had “no experience and no pa tience” – more and more Europeans now seemed to share that impression. Transatlantic misunderstandings and tensions were nourished by Eu rop e’s unfamiliarity with the American political system. “[Europeans] are bewil - dered to find Congress and the Administration often acting independently of each other.” 28 They had witnessed the important role Congress could play in such policy areas as the Marshall Plan and East-West trade. “The fact that Congress can take initiatives contrary to the wishes and policies of the Executive,” the report argued, as was the case with the ‘Battle Act’, creates a feeling of uncertainty and shakes the confidence of many Europeans in the stability of American policies and of the engagements, particularly the long-term ones, which are entered into by the Administration. 29"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"38 Anti-Americanism and the road to Bilderberg A gain, the implication was that as the leader of the Alliance, the United States should pursue a clear and consistent foreign policy that could be un - derstood and relied on by its European partners. Senator Joseph McCarthy’s growing influence in Washington did not make this any easier. Hugh Gaitskell criticized the “anti-communist hyste - ria” and the “tyranny of the majority” in the United States. He presciently argued that if the full scale of McCarthy’s witch hunt became known in Bri tain, critics of the United States would have a field day. The excesses of McCarthyism, Gaitskell argued, questioned the most basic assumptions about right and wrong in the Cold War. “On the rational plane,” he said, “it condemns the main argument of the pro-Americans: that America is, after all, a free democratic country, while Russia is a cruel and ruthless dictatorship.” 30 Europe’s cultural superiority complex Several members of the committee identified what historian Volker Berghahn has called the European cultural “superiority-complex” vis-à-vis the United States. 31 “[T]he average Frenchman,” Pinay wrote, “experiences at one and the same time a superiority complex with regard to the Am ericans, which comes from his history and an inferiority complex in face of the overwhelm - ing material superiority of the New World.” 32 Mollet analyzed French per - ceptions of the United States in similar terms: [T]o many people America appears as the land of refrigerators, of vac - uum cleaners, and of television – a country in which material comfort and mechanisation have developed to a degree which is enviable, but at the same time frightening. [...] [Q]uite understandably [the Frenchman] tends, on the one hand, to caricature this stereotyped idea of a world he hardly knows and, on the other, to console himself for his inferior condition by persuading himself that it is largely recompensed by an understanding of the intellectual, artistic and spiritual values of which the American, because of too much material comfort, has no idea. 33 Both Mollet and Paul Rijkens emphasized the penetration of American mass culture into European societies. Hollywood and comic strips enjoyed great popularity; in fact, “by 1951, more than 60% of the films showing in Western Europe were American.” 34 But many Europeans worried about the cultural and economic impact of this American invasion. In Mollet’s words: “Rightly or wrongly, Americans are considered partly responsible for a real deterioration in taste, and even for a certain moral debasement.” 35 It should be noted that European superiority and inferiority complexes were as much about Europe itself as about the United States. As was so often the case in European history, cultural and socioeconomic anti- Am ericanism was all about Selbstthematisierung – the effort to understand"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Anti-Americanism and the road to Bilderberg 39 th e changes in one’s own society by drawing a comparison with the United States. 36 Because knowledge about America in most European circles was very much limited to precisely those products and economic practices that were the result of American mass society, the European image of America tended to be rather one-sided. The tens of thousands of American officials, soldiers, and tourists spending their dollars in European countries only seemed to reinforce European prejudices about American capitalism and materialism. Such perceptions mattered since they coincided and blended with Eu rop e’s disquiet about America’s new role as the nuclear-armed leader of the Wes ter n world. The United States was no longer just modernity knocking on Europe’s door in the form of Hollywood movies, comics, and mass- pro duced cars; sud - denly the United States could involve Europe in a war (instead of the other way around) at a time that European influence on world affairs was on the wane. 37 Different non-communist political movements, from the Bevanite wing in the British Labour Party to the Gaullists in France, tapped into this new form of anti-Americanism for their own political gain. Communist par - ties, of course, were happy to assist. Decolonization and free trade Retinger’s committee identified several specific policy areas in which Eu ropean and American interests and perceptions diverged. America’s per - ceived “anti-colonialism” was a major cause of friction. Paul van Zeeland argued that the United States showed little appreciation for the efforts of the colonial powers in their overseas territories. The fact that Washington almost by ideological default intervened on behalf of those seeking inde - pendence was criticized in many European countries. Van Zeeland wrote that “this Am erican intervention has ended more than once in making the fate of masses of people in these backward countries a less happy one.” 38 In the case of France, US policies in North Africa caused much resentment. As Prime Minister Pinay put it in his report: “To the French it seems illogical that an ally might try to weaken their position in the Colonies.” 39 The com - mittee’s final report did not suggest any solutions to this problem, but noted that some Europeans were starting to interpret the American attitude as a manifestation of “American imperialism.” Economic liberalization and free trade in the Western world was another important issue. Hugh Gaitskell returned to the family metaphor to ex - plain that Europe suffered to some degree from a “poor-relation complex.” Se veral other contributors noted the striking paradox that the countries that had received the most American assistance under the Marshall Plan were generally more resentful of American economic dominance than the coun - tries that received less aid. Former great powers such as the UK and France, not used to such dependence, seemed to suffer most from this poor-relation complex."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"40 Anti-Americanism and the road to Bilderberg U S-imposed restrictions on East-West trade added to the impression that Washington abused its economic power to bully the Europeans into submis - sion. The fact that the Battle Act – which made aid to Europe dependent on adherence to trade restrictions with the Soviet Union and China – had been imposed on the Truman Administration by Congress did little to alleviate its negative impact on European public opinion. Similarly, the fact that mil - itary and economic aid to Europe under the Mutual Security Act was ne - gotiated on a bilateral basis further emphasized European dependence. 40 At the time of the Marshall Plan aid, such negotiations had been organized multilaterally. The solution to the unhealthy economic imbalance seemed relatively straightforward: Europe should be allowed to earn its own dollars and close the dollar gap. “This means that Europeans should be allowed to export to the United States as unhindered and unhampered as possible.” 41 Especially in light of the Battle Act and other legislation preventing East-West trade, Washington should open its borders and lower tariffs. Otherwise the im - pression would remain that [...] it is America which, while closing to Europe traditional export markets, refuses to open her own; it is thus America which is keeping Eu rope starved of dollars, Britain short of food, France short of coffee, [and] Denmark short of steel. 42 The committee members were, of course, aware that free trade was not nec - essarily a popular subject in Congress. Still, they wanted to impress upon their American audience that the current situation was having a highly neg- ative impact on European-American relations. By doing so, they gave much- needed support to those in the United States who were in favor of both the relaxation of export controls and the lowering of American tariffs – and they did so not only in private. Danish Foreign Minister Kraft emphasized the point in a speech to United Nations correspondents in New York in November 1952: It must naturally cause irritation in Europe that, at the same time as the United States helps us to stand on our own feet and asks us to conduct a trade policy of liberalization, it prevents us, by import restrictions, from earning the dollars necessary to get along without aid. 43 The concluding part of the final report consisted of several general rec - ommendations for improving transatlantic relations. First of all, official propaganda was judged to be of little use. Europeans were “tired of of - ficial propaganda [...] and public men who are known to be protagonists of Am erica, however genuine they might be, are very often for this very reason distrusted by the public.” 44 Therefore, the report argued, “private initiatives” could be much more effective. 45 With respect to policies that"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Anti-Americanism and the road to Bilderberg 41 co ncerned all members of the alliance, consultation was of crucial impor - tance: “[...]our chief recommendation directed to both sides would be not to make any change of policy without previous consultation. Any one-sided and sudden change is bound to have unfortunate repercussions.” The report suggested that NATO was “a most useful instrument” for timely consul - tations and should be used more effectively. In the economic field, similar machinery failed. An “overall review” of the “economic problem” was rec - ommended in light of the “very great importance” of this matter to Europe. The report ended on a general note of caution. If Europe and the United States were to cooperate effectively, mutual understanding was an absolute necessity. In Mollet’s words: Complete frankness in the exchange of views, more contacts, mutual study of our respective problems, having regard on both sides to na - tional susceptibilities [...] – these seem to constitute the means of remov - ing the mistrust in both our countries, and of strengthening the natural ties that unite us. 46 The final report did not spell out what the consequences of a failure in American- Eu ropean cooperation would be. The unspoken assumption, however, was that many European countries were at risk of drifting off towards neutralism, thereby creating a dangerous power vacuum that was bound to be filled by the Soviet Union. The American response and the 1952 presidential election By the time the committee finished its report, the campaign for the presi - dential election in the United States was in full swing. General Dwight D. Ei senhower, who remained popular in Europe as the organizer of D-Day and as the first military leader of NATO, had secured the Republican nomination against the more isolationist Senator Robert Taft. Still, the consensus in the American press was that most Europeans preferred the Democratic candidate Adlai Stevenson. Aggressive Republican campaign oratory about liberation and rollback worried European publics. As New York Times columnist Cyrus Sulzberger reported from Europe: “No power on this Co ntinent is prepared to underwrite a war to free the Lithuanians.” 47 At the same time, suspicions lingered in Europe that the Republicans would return to their traditional policy of isolationism or would shift resources from Eu rope to Asia. The so-called ‘Great Debate’ in early 1951 on the stationing of American ground forces in Europe had not been forgotten. Republicans led by Senator Taft had opposed Truman’s decision to send several divisions to Europe. 48 Quite apart from the European preferences in the race for the White House, the fact that political life in Europe had more or less come to a stand - still as a result of the American presidential election was striking. “ [T]here"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"42 Anti-Americanism and the road to Bilderberg i s a distinct sense of concern in discovering how completely dependent upon the United States Europe has become,” reported Volney D. Hurd from Paris. 49 Anne O’Hare McCormick, using language similar to that of the Retinger committee, blamed the mood in Europe on the “reaction of the poor against the rich, of overstrained economies against the cost of rearma - ment, of old and long-independent peoples against the nagging compulsions of dependence.” 50 Shortly after the election, Prime Minister Antoine Pinay even publicly rebuked American efforts to influence French colonial and financial pol - icies. In the eyes of the State Department, Pinay wanted to capitalize on the anti- Am erican feeling in his country. 51 Yet, as the conclusions of the Retinger committee show, Pinay’s action also reflected a genuine need for a more independent Europe vis-à-vis Washington. Public opinion in France, the UK, and many other European countries no longer accepted a too- vi sible and overwhelming American role on the continent. 52 The incoming Ei senhower Administration, in other words, faced a new chapter in trans - atlantic relations. Two weeks after the presidential election, Retinger and Prince Bernhard separately traveled to the United States to discuss their report with a num - ber of influential Americans. Retinger asked W. Averell Harriman to be - come the point man for a US response, but Harriman, who had just lost the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination to Stevenson, refused. Retinger then turned to the ACUE network and met with General Walter Bedell Smith and Allen Dulles. General Smith, who had been Eisenhower’s Chief of Staff during the war and was known to his friends as ‘Beedle’ or ‘Beetle,’ was about to leave his post at the CIA to become under secretary of state under John Foster Dulles; the second of the Dulles brothers, Allen, succeeded Smith as CIA director. 53 In a letter to Bernhard, Retinger called his visit “completely successful.” “General Bedell Smith and Mr. Allen Dulles,” he wrote, “[...] have quite decided to help in the formation of an unofficial Committee of four or five people.” 54 Adolf Berle Jr., too, had agreed to become a member. Retinger mentioned ACUE members General Lucius Clay and Charles Spofford as other possible participants. In addition, he had approached George Fr anklin Jr. of the Council on Foreign Relations and ACUE to become the “co-ordinator of the committee.” 55 Only John McCloy declined to partici - pate, claiming an overflowing agenda well into 1953. Retinger’s optimism soon turned out to be premature. Dulles and Smith, swamped by work during the transition, didn’t follow through on their promises, and Franklin wrote at the end of December that the CFR could not become involved after all: Any comparable group organized by us would have to include a num - ber of men who had served in important posts with the outgoing ad - ministration, and we doubt whether such men should or would want"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Anti-Americanism and the road to Bilderberg 43 to e xpress their opinion on European-American relations at this time, even in the restricted way you suggest. We feel that in this country much more can be done to better European-American relations by the new administration than by any private group on this side of the water, no matter how important or well qualified. 56 Six weeks later, Prince Bernhard decided to call his friend Bedell Smith and ask him to name at least one American representative who could organize an American response. In a follow-up letter, Bernhard wrote that Pinay, Van Zeeland, Gaitskell, and Rijkens had all contacted him to emphasize the urgency of the matter since “public opinion in Europe is not improving.” 57 Yet Bedell Smith remained unwilling or unable to act. In May, Bernhard again urged him to do something: You know that I realize how terribly busy you are with all the various problems and I know that on receipt of this letter you will probably curse a couple of times. All the same, I have got to give these people some answer. The problem is definitely not made any easier through Russia’s latest attitude. So please write me something definite in any form you like, so that I have it in my hands before May 22nd [...] 58 Bedell Smith now passed the ball to Charles D. Jackson, special assistant to the president for International Affairs. As Jackson later wrote to Ann Whitman, Eisenhower’s secretary: Beedle was up to his ears in CIA stuff, and then swamped all over again early in ‘53 by being appointed Under Secretary of State. [...] Finally, in desperation, Beedle asked me, since I knew Bernhard quite well, if I could help him out of his fix, and I agreed to take over the project. 59 Jackson had been a member of Eisenhower’s staff during World War II and knew Prince Bernhard well – so well, in fact, that at some point the “dual control stick” of Bernhard’s plane ended up in Jackson’s trouser leg, “with considerable inconvenience to aerial movement,” as Jackson recalled in a letter to the Prince. 60 Jackson served as president of the National Co mmittee for a Free Europe in 1952–1953 and was one of a number of people involved in the Committee who became active in the Eisenhower campaign and ad- ministration (Ann Whitman was another). There is some disagreement in the literature over Jackson’s actual influ - ence in the Eisenhower Administration.

Brands places Jackson in the “third rank” of Eisenhower men, responsible for stirring up the bureaucracy and bringing in new ideas. 61 Brands points out that Jackson “possessed one of Washington’s lowest bat - ting averages, in terms of ideas accepted and put into practice.” 62 Other"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"44 Anti-Americanism and the road to Bilderberg s cholars attach more weight to Jackson’s position, labeling him the “chief architect of America’s psychological warfare effort during and after World Wa r I I.” 63 Fact is that even after his retirement from the administration Jackson remained close to President Eisenhower and several of Ei s e n hower’s most important advisers, including the Dulles brothers. Moreover, as the publisher of one of the most influential American magazines and as a confi - dant of Henry Luce, Jackson was a force to be reckoned with in the molding and influencing of American public opinion. 64 When Bedell Smith wrote to Jackson asking him to take on the project, he made clear that in his view, the matter held little priority. The only thing that needed to be done right now was to give Prince Bernhard “a crumb of comfort to indicate that something is or will be done on our part to eval - uate this survey and possibly to provide its U.S. counterpart [...].” 65 In re - sponse, Jackson decided to send Retinger’s report to several friends in the Ei senhower Administration, including Allen Dulles and Richard Bissell at the CIA. 66 He reassured Prince Bernhard that “a group of comparable stat - ure” was now being organized in the United States. 67 By the end of August, no further progress had been made, and Retinger became increasingly despondent. One of the conclusions of his report had been that Washington should pay closer attention to its European allies; now the opposite seemed to be happening. “Our friends in the Group work - ing on the problem of European-American relations,” he told Bernhard, are very worried about the present state of affairs. Only a few days ago I had a long talk with M. Guy Mollet, who thinks we ought to take some initiative in the matter, as according to our information the relationship between America and most of the European countries is deteriorating very rapidly. 68 Then an unexpected development came to the rescue. As Jackson later told Ann Whitman, “God intervened in the shape of the newly founded Col eman Co mmittee, which was the citizens’ committee to carry the torch for the Rand all Commission.” 69 The Coleman Committee, officially the Co mmittee for a Na tional Trade Policy, was founded to promote free trade. Its chair - man, John S. Coleman, was president of the Burroughs Cor poration based in De troit. Other members included Joseph P. Spang, president of the Gill ette Corporation, John McCloy (now at the Chase National Bank), and Henry J. “Jack” Heinz II of ketchup fame. George W. Ball, a Washington- ba sed interna - tional lawyer at the firm Cleary, Gottlieb, served as the committee’s secretary. In its first press release, the Coleman Committee announced it would “work for public understanding of the need for an expansion of trade and a reduction of trade barriers.” 70 The committee argued that the United States should open its markets to its allies in the free world. Only by permitting these countries to earn dollars through trading, could the economic and mil - itary aid programs be terminated. American foreign economic policy could"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Anti-Americanism and the road to Bilderberg 45 no l onger be separated from matters of national security, since the Cold War had made “the building of a free world coalition” imperative: “We cannot draw the free peoples together militarily if we divide them economically.” 71 Given the similarities between this message and the conclusions of Retinger’s report, it is clear why Jackson decided to contact Coleman in early September. 72 To Jackson’s relief, he received a positive reply by the end of the month. Several members of the Committee, Coleman included, agreed to personally organize the American response to Retinger’s report. 73 The question remains why the American response was so slow. Bedell Smith and Dulles undoubtedly faced more pressing concerns in their new positions in the Eisenhower Administration. But even after Jackson took over, the pace hardly quickened. Jackson’s suspicions about Retinger seem to have played an important role. As he told Whitman, he had been in - formed by people “who are in a position to know better than I” that Retinger might operate as a British secret agent. Jackson’s distrust of Retinger was nourished by his obvious dislike of the Pole. He wrote that during his time as President of the National Committee for a Free Europe “no matter where the rug was placed, whether New York, London, Paris, Munich, Rome, or what have you, Retinger always managed to crawl out from under it at the most awkward moment.” 74 In a letter to John C. Hughes, the US Permanent Representative to NATO, Jackson called Retinger “Prince Bernhard’s Richelieu” and wrote: As you know, I try to use both my head and the seat of my britches (sometimes I can’t tell which is which), and the seat of my britches tells me that Mr. Retinger is dangerous medicine, to be taken in very small doses if at all, and then only on the instruction of that prominent inter - national toxicologist, Dr. Hughes. 75 Jackson asked Hughes for “guidance” on how to handle Retinger, point - ing to his connection with Major-General Colin Gubbins, the former SOE chief. Hughes replied that he strongly suspected “that the military figure mentioned at the bottom of the first page of your letter [i.e. Gubbins] has a special interest.” He also indicated, however, that he thought Retinger’s efforts were not without value, calling the report produced by the group “most interesting.” 76 As it happened, Jackson was never able to move beyond the realm of sus - picion. He failed to establish a definite connection between Retinger and the British secret service. The fact that Retinger had cooperated with Bri tish in - telligence during World War II was no secret and adequately explains his re - lationship with Major-General Gubbins. 77 Gubbins, moreover, had retired to private life after the war and was no longer involved in British intelli - gence. 78 When in 1955 Prince Bernhard learned of the American suspicions, he was not overly worried. He asked for evidence and dismissed the matter when none was produced. 79"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"46 Anti-Americanism and the road to Bilderberg The Eisenhower Administration and anti-Americanism in Eu rope The fact that official Washington was slow to respond did not mean that the Eisenhower Administration wasn’t interested in anti-Americanism. On the contrary, the new administration was quick to identify anti-Americanism as a serious problem in Europe. The State Department and the CIA hurried to produce several memoranda on the issue, and anti-Americanism played an important role in the Administration’s review of basic national security p ol ic y. It is not clear whether the CIA made use of Retinger’s report, but its anal - ysis of anti-Americanism echoed several of the report’s conclusions. The CIA argued that European distrust of US leadership was based on the belief that the United States has not had sufficient experience in foreign affairs to offer wise and farsighted leadership. [...] Throughout Europe we are often charged with impatience and impetuosity, with an ‘all-or-nothing’ approach in the East-West conflict, and with intending to press the pres - ent struggle to a conclusion entailing humiliation of or annihilation of the Soviet Union. 80 In addition, frustration over restrictions on East-West trade and over Am erica’s protectionist trade policies severely harmed American standing in Europe. Since the summer of 1952, two factors had further complicated relations between Europe and the United States. The first, ironically, was Stalin’s death in March 1953 and the Soviet “peace offensive” that followed. This had led to a “desire to escape the burdens of armament” as well as the strong wish in Europe to “settle the Cold War by negotiation.” 81 The United States, moreover, was often perceived as the obstacle to such a settlement. The sec - ond factor was McCarthyism. As Gaitskell had predicted, many Eur opeans objected to McCarthy’s methods, and McCarthyism received much at - tention in the European press, thus hurting America’s public diplomacy. The impact of President Eisenhower’s “Chance for Peace” speech of April 16, 1953, for example, was “to some extent lost in the almost simultaneous re action of mingled ridicule and dismay provoked by the Cohn-Schine in - vestigation of US information centers in Europe and the subsequent ‘book b u r n i n g s ’.” 82 In October 1953, the National Security Council approved policy paper NSC 162/2 as the new basic guideline for American security policy. NSC 162/2 explicitly spelled out the dangers of anti-Americanism in connec - tion with the Soviet threat. “The United States cannot [...] meet its defense needs,” NSC 162/2 argued, “even at exorbitant cost, without support of al - l i e s.” 83 The strength and cohesion of the coalition, however, was threatened"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Anti-Americanism and the road to Bilderberg 47 by t he recent decline in US prestige as reported in the CIA memo on anti- Am ericanism. 84 As NSC 162/2 stated: allied opinion, especially in Europe, has become less willing to follow U.S. leadership. Many Europeans fear that American policies, particu - larly in the Far East, may involve Europe in general war, or will indef - initely prolong cold-war tensions. Many consider U.S. attitudes toward the Soviets as too rigid and unyielding and, at the same time, as unstable, holding risks ranging from preventive war and ‘liberation’ to withdrawal into isolation. The NSC paper concluded: “these allied attitudes materially impair coop - eration and, if not overcome, could imperil the coalition.” 85 To strengthen the coalition, America’s allies should be convinced that “our strategy is one of collective security,” thereby enhancing the “feeling of a community of i nt e r e st.” 86 With respect to trade, President Eisenhower turned out to be fully on the side of the Retinger committee. Eisenhower believed that liberalized trade would spur economic growth, thereby making American aid unnecessary and raising the standard of living in Western Europe. 87 Moreover, he be - lieved that East-West trade restrictions on non-strategic goods did more harm than good, since they undermined the unity of the Western world. By the summer of 1954, Eisenhower succeeded in partly reversing export con - trol policies. After negotiations with Britain and France, almost half of the items on the list of prohibited goods were removed. 88 The American report Around the same time that NSC 162/2 was approved, the Coleman Com - mittee started working on its report on American attitudes toward relations with Europe. 89 In line with the rules of Retinger’s committee, the American memorandum was written anonymously, but George Ball was probably its principal author. 90 Ball was a logical choice, given his extensive experience and knowledge of the European scene. 91 He was energetic and eloquent, and had worked closely with Jean Monnet, at first for the French Supply Council and then in setting up the Organisation for European Economic Co operation (OEEC) and the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). 92 In May 1950, Ball was probably the only American to have seen the Schuman Plan before it was announced to the public. 93 Another of Ball’s European clients was the Patronat Français , the French industrial association. Ball’s report identified a number of issues on which “Americans are often critical of Europeans.” The first concerned (anti-)communism. He acknowl - edged European criticism of McCarthyism and the “psychotic concern with internal security” in the United States. On the European side, however,"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"48 Anti-Americanism and the road to Bilderberg m any tended to underestimate the communist threat. “To American eyes,” Ball argued, the Europeans’ intense, understandable fear of war, their desire to do everything in their power to avoid it, often leads them to deceive them - selves about the nature of the danger that confronts us all. Even sensi - tive and internationally-minded Americans, who are well aware of the defects of American behavior, are at a loss to understand the neutral - ism of so many European intellectuals, the facile equating of ‘American im perialism’ with communist imperialism. 94 In Ball’s view, the Western values of freedom, democracy, and tolerance were superior to those apparent in Soviet behavior. In the struggle between Western and Soviet values, there should be no place for neutralism. With respect to decolonization, Ball recognized a certain degree of “naive Utopianism” in the United States. On the other hand, the “dispassionate” American position was “that the pressure of popular resistance to colonial status is rising everywhere and that the attempt to contain it, in effect by force, will sooner or later become too costly and will finally fail.” 95 Finally, Ball discussed the connected issues of German rearmament and European integration. He acknowledged that the American public might lack a sophisticated understanding of the many psychological and politi - cal reasons for the widespread resistance against German rearmament. Many Americans, however, found it “intolerable that the Germans should be prohibited from contributing their very sizeable resources to the com - mon defense.” Aside from the military question, it was the official US view that Germany should be integrated solidly in the Western world, thereby preempting the danger of a future Rapallo. Western Europe should agree to some “pooling of national sovereignties,” since even the largest nations of continental Western Europe are too small, relative to the USSR on one side and the US on the other, to satisfy their own aspirations or to be fully effective as allies if they maintain their full separateness from one another. 96 This was also true in the economic realm. Ball was in favor of “trade not aid,” but he suggested that the Europeans had a long way to go themselves. Why not begin by reforming at home before pointing a finger at the United States? From the American point of view, it was self-evident that Europe should work toward “the creation of a single market.” 97 Organizing the first Bilderberg conference After receiving the American report, Retinger and Bernhard immediately called a series of meetings in Paris and Brussels in early 1954. On January 18,"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Anti-Americanism and the road to Bilderberg 49 se veral members of the committee got together to discuss a synthesis of the European and American reports as well as possible courses of future action. 98 Although some of the original irritants between Europe and the United States had been resolved, many problems remained. On the positive side, Gaitskell argued, transatlantic tensions had been re - duced as a result of the peace treaty in Korea, and the dollar gap had shrunk. On the negative side, many Europeans were concerned about a possible eco - nomic downturn in the United States and its consequences for Eur opean economies. The memories of the Great Depression and the difficult years af - ter the war were present in everyone’s mind (“Slump would be hell,” Prince Bernhard wrote in his notes). Second, the issue of colonialism had become more important since the Soviet Union had set its sights squarely on “the colonial territories.” 99 Third, in Europe the issue of overriding importance was the European Defense Community with its highly uncertain prospects. Finally, as the Eisenhower Administration had already recognized in NSC 162/2, the Soviet peace offensive had made it more difficult to reach agree - ment on a common Cold War strategy. “The apparent or possible change in Russian foreign policy,” Gaitskell said, has proved an apple of discord between the Allies because there is dis - agreement about what it portends. It is therefore highly desirable to try and narrow any differences between Europe and America on the tactics to be pursued towards Russia in present circumstances. 100 Gaitskell and Prince Bernhard suggested that these problems should be discussed at a larger meeting of about 50 high-level personalities. Prince Bernhard still thought the Retinger committee should remain secret and therefore could not be the organizing party. He suggested that the Dutch or the Belgian government might be asked to arrange such a meeting. Yet after consultations with Dutch Foreign Minister Johan Willem Beyen in early February, it was agreed that the Prince would issue the invitations for the conference. 101 The first meeting with the American representatives Coleman, Ball, and Charles Taft took place in Paris on February 7 and 8. 102 “On entering the room,” Ball remembered in his memoirs, “we found not only Prince Be rnhard but also Guy Mollet, [...] and Antoine Pinay, [...] – two men who, I thought, would rarely be seen together at a private conference.” 103 John Hughes, who joined the committee for lunch, reported to Jackson that the Americans had made “an excellent impression.” On the European side Pinay, Mollet, and Van Zeeland had taken “an especially active part in the talks.” 104 Retinger and Gubbins had submitted a draft for the final report, which was discussed extensively. 105 The committee agreed that all participants could transmit the conclusions to their respective governments, yet the iden - tity of the members of the committee would remain secret. 106 Gaitskell again underlined the need for anonymity, with respect to the larger transatlantic"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"50 Anti-Americanism and the road to Bilderberg m eeting as well. 107 He was worried that the prospect of publicity would have “a hampering influence on those attending.” 108 The Americans welcomed the plan to hold a meeting in the Netherlands. Prince Bernhard emphasized that it should be a balanced group “of different shades of opinion.” 109 As Paul Rijkens wrote in his memoirs, the idea was to bring together the leaders of the left and the right. 110 Anti- Americanism, a fter all, was not limited to certain ideological groups or political parties. Moreover, the broader aim of strengthening the Western alliance in face of the Soviet threat implied the need to overcome the social and economic troubles that plagued so many European countries; this could only be done on a bipartisan basis. During another meeting on February 25 at Van Zeeland’s house in Brussels, the final report was finished. 111 It drew heavily on the other reports, but also contained some new points. With respect to communism, it added that com - munism in Western Europe often should be understood as a protest vote. In Italy, the report claimed, only 1 in 19 people voting for the Communist Party ac - tually wished the establishment of a communist system. Relieving the economic and social discontent that lay at the base of these protest votes would therefore be far more effective than a McCarthy-style persecution of Communists. The report identified European economic integration as the best way of doing so. Not much time was left to organize the Bilderberg conference scheduled for late May 1954. Retinger, assisted by the members of his committee, took the lead in selecting European participants. He relied on his EM network to do so, inviting pro-Europeans such as Roger Motz, president of the Belgian Liberal Party; Etienne de la Vallée Poussin, a Belgian Christian socialist senator; Jean Drapier, a leading Belgian socialist; and Denis de Ro ugemont, the director of the Centre Européen de la Culture in Geneva. Retinger relied partly on André Voisin, the leader of the pro-European organization La Fédération , for recruiting French participants. Voisin rejected Wilf rid Baumgartner for being too hostile to European unification. Retinger did invite politicians such as Maurice Faure, a radical socialist member of Pa rliament, and Pierre-Henri Teitgen, the president of the Christian- De mocratic Mouvement Républicain Populaire (MRP). 112 In Great Britain, Retinger, Rijkens, and Gaitskell could rely on their ex - tensive networks in government and business circles. Retinger contacted Harold Macmillan as well as Frank Roberts at the Foreign Office, asking them to propose several conservative participants. He did not fail to mention that Gaitskell would surely organize a strong Labour presence. Ma cmillan passed on his request to Anthony Eden; Roberts told Eden: Although I did not say this to Retinger, it seems to me that this con - ference, presided over by Prince Bernhard, will rally a number of im - portant European and American figures and that it would therefore be worth while to take some trouble to encourage appropriate Conserva - tive Party representatives to go to The Hague. 113"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Anti-Americanism and the road to Bilderberg 51 In t he end, an impressive British group came to the Bilderberg conference with, among others, Sir Oliver Franks, the former ambassador to the United States; Sir Robert Boothby, a conservative MP; John Foster, the secretary of state for Commonwealth Relations; Denis Healey, an up-and-coming La - bour politician; Tom Williamson, general secretary of the National Union of General and Municipal Workers; and Sir Harry Pilkington, the president of the British Trade Federation. In Scandinavia, Gubbins – who had had close ties to resistance groups in the region – and Kraft did most of the recruiting. They invited Leif Høegh, a wealthy Norwegian shipowner; Finn Moe, the socialist chairman of the For eig n Affairs Committee; and the journalists Terkel Terkelsen and Herbert Tingsten. In Germany, Max Brauer and Rudolf Mueller assisted Retinger. Brauer, for example, made sure that leading trade unionist Ludwig Rosenberg attended the conference. 114 In Italy, Alcide de Gasperi helped arrange the participation of politicians Giovanni F. Malagodi and Raffaele Cafiero, as well as the leading businessmen Alberto Pirelli and Vittorio Va lletta, the president of Fiat. 115 The Coleman Committee was responsible for inviting American par - ticipants. Yet after it became clear that Coleman planned to ask mainly businessmen connected to his committee, Retinger and Prince Bernhard in - tervened. In March 1954, Bernhard spent three weeks in the United States, test-flying some of the newest Air Force planes, and narrowly avoiding a deadly crash in one of them. 116 At the start of his trip he visited the White House and told President Eisenhower of the plans for the Bilderberg confer - ence. Eisenhower assured him that he was interested in the undertaking and that he would like to see the final report on transatlantic relations. 117 Several weeks later, Prince Bernhard followed up with a letter urging the president to assist in enlisting influential Americans who did not come from the business community. Bernhard emphasized that in contrast to the American group, the European list was balanced and of high standing: [...] you see my fear is that only U.S. top business people will not be a really good counterpart for the purpose of our discussions – mutual understanding and the spreading of it in our press and especially in our political spheres – parliaments and such. 118 Prince Bernhard asked Eisenhower whether he could not arrange for the participation of some important politicians, diplomats – Bernhard men - tioned John Hughes and James Conant – or trade unionists. The president referred Prince Bernhard’s request to the State Department, where it was promptly turned down. Acting Secretary Robert D. Murphy argued that Ambassadors Conant and Hughes might be drawn into unpleas - ant discussions on such issues as McCarthyism and the hydrogen bomb and “could hardly divest themselves of their official capacities.” 119 Anything they said might be interpreted as an “official statement of the U.S. govern - m e nt.” 120 The State Department suggested that participation of several labor"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"52 Anti-Americanism and the road to Bilderberg l eaders might give the American delegation “a more representative charac - ter.” To Bernhard’s chagrin, Eisenhower did not overrule Murphy. Hughes and Co nant were not given permission to travel to the Netherlands. Instead, Irving Brown, the European representative of the American Federation of Labor, and his colleague W.F. Schnitzler were found willing to participate. President Eisenhower told Prince Bernhard that he had also contacted Congressional leaders, but had been advised that the Legislative program is at such a critical point in the Congress that it would be extremely detrimental to its successful enactment to have any appropriate members of the Congress leave the country to par - ticipate in [the] conference you are calling. 121 Coleman had reached the same conclusion after talks with several congress - men and senators and pointed out that 1954 was an election year. 122 In the end, the American delegation included George Ball; Barry Bi ngham, a newspaper publisher and former Marshall Plan representative in France; Gardner Cowles Jr., the publisher of Look magazine; John Ferguson, a Pa ris-based colleague of Ball at Cleary, Gottlieb; Jack Heinz II; C. D. Jac kson; George C. McGhee, a Texas oilman and diplomat; George Nebolsine, a lawyer at the New York firm Coudert & Brothers; Paul H. Nitze, the former director of the State Department’s Policy Planning Staff; George W. Perkins, a former assistant secretary of state for European Affairs; David Rockefeller; and James D. Zellerbach, a businessman and former Marshall Plan representative in Italy. The CIA, meanwhile, was not involved in organizing or financing the Bilderberg Group. The oft-repeated claim that the Bilderberg Group was a CIA-sponsored organization is not only unfounded, it is more or less the ex - act opposite from what actually happened. 123 As we have seen, neither CIA Director Allen Dulles nor former CIA Director Walter Bedell Smith were willing or able to assist Retinger. In fact, until the success of the first Bilder - berg conference, the Eisenhower Administration was surprisingly reluctant to cooperate with the Retinger committee. If not for Prince Bernhard’s per - sonal interventions, Retinger’s initiative might well have failed altogether. Funding for the first Bilderberg conference, moreover, came almost exclu - sively from European sources. 124 This does not mean, of course, that the CIA was not interested in the activities of the Retinger committee. A week before the first Bilderberg con - ference, CIA Director Dulles noted at a deputies’ meeting that David Rockefeller was planning to go to Holland to attend a meeting with Prince Bernhard, C.D. Jackson, and others, including Dr. Jo seph Retinger, and stated in view of Retinger’s background and interest in this meeting its outcome would bear watching. 125 Both Rockefeller and Ferguson wrote reports on the conference and shared these with the CIA and the State Department. 126"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Anti-Americanism and the road to Bilderberg 53 Th e decision to organize the first transatlantic Bilderberg conference in the spring of 1954 was important for several reasons. The two continents were more closely aligned than they had ever been in peacetime; in the face of the challenges of the Cold War, decolonization, and globalization, they needed a common outlook on a wide range of issues. Yet the need for close cooperation, combined with Europe’s frustrating dependence on the United States, inevitably caused misunderstandings and disagreements. The good news was that these could be overcome, the bad news that the young alliance was not very good at doing so. The fusion of different forms of political, cul - tural, and socioeconomic anti-Americanism in the early 1950s threatened to undermine the very idea of collective security on which NATO was based. As a result, new modes of transatlantic coordination and consultation had to be developed concerning issues such as (anti-)communism, East-West relations, the colonial question, trade, and European integration. Retinger’s long experience in nongovernmental action and informal diplomacy led him to create a private group to deal with these problems. Over time, the Bilderberg meetings helped to form and expand the in - formal transatlantic alliance, consisting of a significant number of private or semi-private organizations and networks. The ripple effects of this in - formal alliance could be felt on many levels, from personal connections and friendships to transnational consensus building and agenda setting. Given the fact that official US public diplomacy had to some degree become co unterproductive – as both the Retinger committee and the Ps ychological Strategy Board concluded – informal efforts to sustain the transatlantic partnership became all the more important. In line with Geir Lundestad’s “empire by invitation” argument, the de - cision to organize the Bilderberg conference was very much the result of Eu ropean concerns and European actions. 127 The Retinger commit - tee brought together a diverse group of Atlanticist Europeans who were convinced that transatlantic cooperation was indispensable and therefore wished to counter the rise in anti-Americanism in Europe. The result was a greater awareness on both sides of the Atlantic that the United States could no longer expect to push through its preferences. If, in the immediate postwar years, the United States had created, in Charles Maier’s words, “a multizonal structure of ascendancy” based on “shared security goals, eco - nomic support, cultural policies, and sometimes undercover subsidies,” the European partners in this structure now demanded a larger say in the West’s global affairs. 128 A new phase in transatlantic relations had started.

Then, between the years 1950 and 1954, there is a big increase – from eight times in 1950, to 29 times in 1951, 52 times in 1952 and 83 times in 1954.

The first session of the conference was dominated by European criticism of the United States in the context of the tense international situ - ation. Dien Bien Phu had fallen on May 7, and despite strong pressure from the Eisenhower Administration, the British government had opposed a US proposal to consider joint military intervention to assist the faltering French army in Indochina . Meanwhile, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles’ threat of an “agonizing reappraisal” of the Eisenhower Ad ministration’s Eu ropean policies had failed to push the French towards quickly accept - ing the European Defense Community (EDC). The only thing the threat seemed to have accomplished was to reawaken the specter of American iso - lationism. The Eisenhower Administration’s talk of withdrawing soldiers from Europe reinforced these concerns. To make matters worse, Senator McCarthy had just broadened his scorching attacks on US institutions, much to the dismay of many Europeans. Based on the detailed transcripts of the first Bilderberg conference, this chapter shows how European apprehensions about McCarthyism and the international situation inevitably found their way into the Bilderberg dis - cussions, underlining the highly emotional nature of the transatlantic 3 The first Bilderberg conference"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The first Bilderberg conference 61 re lationship. Starting with an early intervention by Sir Oliver Franks re - garding the powerful emotional impact of the Korean War on the United States, many participants returned to the significance of emotions over the course of the next three days. Some of these emotions were decidedly negative. After the opening ses - sion, C. D. Jackson complained in his diary about the “brilliantly executed British hostility” against the United States, and Chairman Prince Bernhard cautioned the Bilderberg participants that he had “heard little more than expressions of irritation.” 2 Nevertheless, the overall atmosphere at the con - ference turned out to be surprisingly constructive, in part because a strong positive sense of emotional community found frequent expression in the al - most ritualized reciting of shared values in the face of the threat posed by Soviet communism. The global mindset of most participants also played a role: time and time again participants emphasized the need for transatlantic cooperation and unity in the face of a rapidly changing world. In the words of Prince Bernhard’s opening address, “the national or even the continental viewpoint is inadequate and should give way to a global one.” 3 The global mindset implied a constant effort to understand transatlantic differences in attitudes and approaches. At the first Bilderberg conference, this effort involved a long list of issues on the agenda. The organizers had asked one American and one European participant to prepare a brief pa - per each to set off discussions: Paul Nitze and Alcide de Gasperi on com - munism , David Rockefeller and Hugh Gaitskell on economic relations , Barry Bingham and the Dutch civil servant Hans M. Hirschfeld on the problem of overseas territories , George Ball and Etienne de la Vallée Poussin on Eu ropean unification , and James Zellerbach and Guy Mollet on the EDC . The Bilderberg discussions laid bare not only many transatlantic differences on these issues, but also many intra-European ones. A three-day conference could do only so much to overcome these differences, but in the end even initial Bilderberg skeptics such as Jackson felt that the effort to develop a better grasp of elite opinions and sensibilities on both sides of the Atlantic had been worthwhile. 4 Hotel de Bilderberg, May 1954 Hotel De Bilderberg was a medium-sized, family-run hotel, mainly chosen for its quiet and remote location in the forests of the eastern Ne therlands. It was not a particularly fancy hotel – old curtains had to be used as ta - blecloths in the conference room – but security was relatively easy to maintain since there was only one access road. Police protection ensured that no uninvited visitors were able to intrude, and the Dutch secret ser - vice screened all hotel employees. Those with communist sympathies were asked to stay home for the week. 5 An additional advantage of the Bi lderberg Hotel was that, in the absence of any major cities nearby, all participants were more or less forced to stay at the hotel for three full days."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"62 The first Bilderberg conference A s Retinger’s assistant, John Pomian, later recalled, the idea was to create an atmosphere of trust among the participants by spending a great deal of time together, not only during the official discussions, but also at the dinner table and over drinks. 6 In terms of practical arrangements, Paul Rijkens made available a team of Unilever employees that prepared the conference and staffed the eight- pe rson conference secretariat. Two Philips technicians operated the spe - cially installed audio system, and four translators provided simultaneous translation in the two official conference languages, English and French. 27 drivers and 20 cars were available for transportation, 23 extra telephone lines were installed at the hotel, and copies of international newspapers were ordered. “I have never seen a meeting which went off more smoothly,” Rockefeller told Prince Bernhard afterwards, “[and] I have had enough to do with such affairs to know how much advance thinking and planning this requires.” 7 The conference was largely financed by contributions from a dozen large Dutch companies, including Unilever, Philips, Heineken, KLM, and Ho ogovens. Prince Bernhard had personally appealed to them, arguing that it was important to bring the conference to the Netherlands. In addi - tion, Prince Bernhard, Kraft, Mueller, Quaroni, and Van Zeeland contrib - uted between £150 and £1000. Most American participants paid for their own transportation, but all other costs were covered by the funds raised by Prince Bernhard. 8 Journalists were not allowed to cover the Bilderberg discussions, although several publishers and editors were present. The conference organizers did hold a press conference after the end of the Bilderberg meeting and released a press statement summarizing the results of the discussions. The first morning session on Saturday, May 29, 1954, served to collect general impressions about the state of European-American relations. Prince Bernhard chaired the session and did so with charm, quickly succeeding in establishing an atmosphere conducive to open discussions. 9 In his opening statement, Bernhard went out of his way to stress the common values and culture shared by Europe and the United States: Europeans and Americans are linked by the same basic cultural back - ground, the same basic civilisation, the same faith and to a very large extent by the same blood. We can rightly speak of the Atlantic civili - sation of which we all share the origin: the European and still earlier the Mediterranean civilisation. This explains, more than anything else, why during the last decennia, whenever European nations got into a big conflict, America, as a member of the same family, joined in. In the face of a real external threat we find ourselves on the same side. This explained [...] why the United States had twice come to the rescue of Europe and why in response to the Cold War challenges, the Western world should hold together again."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"The first Bilderberg conference 63 Pr ince Bernhard went on to explain the internationalist rationale behind the Retinger group and the Bilderberg meeting: Since the free countries of Europe, the United States and Canada must act as one, they will need a certain unity of outlook and they must make an effort to think in terms of Western partnership as a whole. That means that we must promote a new way of thinking, transcending the Old World mentality which often has a provincial look about it. This could help Western people realize their common interest. [...] To my mind the inter-dependence of the Western countries makes interest in one’s neighbour’s affairs not only natural but necessary and vital. In practice, Bernhard argued, cooperation had to take the form of “multi - lateral agreements” such as NATO. In an indirect appeal to the Americans, he underlined the need for careful consultation. “Uncoordinated action,” he said, “unagreed [ sic ] moves, decisions affecting allies which have been uni - laterally taken, all these things carry grave dangers by providing the enemy with the immediate chance and the weapon to try to divide us.” 10 Despite Prince Bernhard’s call for unity, the first session – and the subse- quent one concerning communism – soon turned into a contentious transat - lantic debate. The American publisher Gardner Cowles Jr. set the tone early on by expressing his disappointment “that so many Europeans thought that the situation in Asia did not call for immediate action.” He referred to two recent speeches on the Indochina crisis to illustrate the different attitudes towards the Cold War: In the United States [Chief of Naval Operations] Admiral Carney had said that the United States were now rapidly approaching a crossroad in the final fight to finish with Soviet Russia, whereas Sir Winston Churchill appealed for patience in our dealings with Soviet Russia. 11 The Bilderberg participants had likely read about Admiral Robert B. Carney’s speech in their morning papers. The New York Times gave the speech front- page coverage and printed it in full on page 2. According to the Times , “the admiral’s statement was interpreted authoritatively here and in Washington as a new warning that the United States and its allies must be prepared for the possibility of joining the fighting in Indochina.” 12 The trouble was that no agreement existed on the rationale for joining the fighting. France had fought the deeply unpopular war to maintain its colonial empire, yet other NATO members – the United States in particular – were unwilling to send troops into the jungles of Indochina without the promise of independence for Vietnam. At the same time, the Ei senhower Ad ministration’s fixation on the communist threat, as expressed by the president in early April with the analogy of the domino theory, wasn’t shared to the same extent in European capitals. The British government,"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"64 The first Bilderberg conference f or example, was less worried about dominos falling than about a possible escalation of the conflict, leading to the involvement of China and perhaps even of the Soviet Union. The politics of the Indochina crisis, moreover, differed on both sides of the Atlantic. In the United States, anti-Chinese sentiment, particularly among Republicans, remained so strong that US diplomats were forbidden to shake the hands of their Chinese counterparts. In much of Europe, on the other hand, the Geneva negotiations about In dochina were regarded as a much-needed way out of a further escalation of the conflict. In response to Cowles, Hugh Gaitskell strongly criticized the lack of consultation and unity within the Western alliance. Given America’s much greater involvement in the Korean War, he argued, the American assess - ment of the Soviet threat naturally differed from European perceptions. Ho wever, the open division among the Western powers at the Geneva Co nference on Indochina gave “dangerous encouragement to the enemy.” 13 NATO had been successful in stabilizing the situation in Western Europe and in preventing “sudden attacks,” but consultation between the member governments was inadequate. “Many of the difficulties could have been avoided,” Gaitskell said, “if more satisfactory machinery existed for inter- go vernmental discussion.” 14 Sir Oliver Franks followed with a long statement supporting Gaitskell. He agreed that the Korean crisis in 1950, in particular the Chinese intervention, had been the crucial break in the postwar period. As the British Ambassador in Washington, Franks had been in a position to witness the “massive emo - tional states” that had arisen in the United States. 15 He worried that “real differences of policy or emphasis could in the long run be solved by hard negotiation, but those emotional states rendered a solution impossible.” As a result, many people in the United Kingdom “wondered whether America acted from passion rather than from policy.” McCarthyism, Franks added, reflected the psychological gap between the new and the old world that had widened markedly since the summer of 1950. A related problem was the way in which officials voiced their opinions in both countries. Americans “erred on the side of mild exaggeration” whereas the British preferred the art of “understatement.” Taking Admiral Carney’s speech as an example, Franks joked that the British version would have sounded something like this: “If the Russians continue in this way, I believe we should pay a bit more attention to them.” The Bilderberg summary at this point simply noted “( h i l a r it y).” 16 The Italian liberal Giovanni Malagodi reinforced Franks’ analysis of emotional states by contrasting “American impatience” with “European patience” based on the realization that no quick or easy solution to such is - sues as the EDC was possible. Malagodi noted, in agreement with Gaitskell, that better machinery for consultation was needed and that Article 2 of the North Atlantic Treaty could be used to deepen ties between the NATO allies."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"The first Bilderberg conference 65 How to deal with communism?

On the American side be - wilderment at the European reluctance to act forcefully against communist expansionism was expressed in equally strong terms. This was a problem because a common Western policy in the Cold War depended, to a large extent, on a common assessment of the adversary. The constant reports about the excesses of McCarthyism strengthened anti-American sentiments in Eu rope and undermined US leadership in NATO. Conversely, the percep - tion in Washington that many European countries were both ‘soft’ on inter - nal communism and unwilling to face the threat of Soviet expansionism had a negative effect on Congress’ willingness to pay for the American presence in Europe and reinforced neo-isolationist thinking. Former Italian Prime Minister Alcide de Gasperi and American diplo - mat Paul Nitze had prepared papers on the attitudes towards communism. They illustrated the sharply diverging views and perceptions: the American tendency to think in Manichean terms of good and evil contrasted with the European conviction that communism as a political ideology had to be battled with political means and would not disappear overnight. 17 The most basic difference was, of course, that in many European countries com - munism was a fact of life, whereas in the United States communism never was a major political force. Senator Raffaele Cafiero had taken De Gasperi’s place at the conference because the former Italian prime minister was too ill to be present (he died three months later). De Gasperi’s report made clear that Italy had a long and painful history of dealing with communism. The fascist reaction in the 1920s had led to a dictatorship and had been a “costly experience” for It aly. The les - son to be learned was that a successful response had to consist of “democratic education and the improvement of social conditions.” De Ga speri argued that McCarthyism was a dangerous mistake, an overreaction comparable to the fascist movement in Italy. High unemployment and a depressed standard of living were the main sources for communist strength in a country such as Italy. Combined with a large and efficient communist organization, consider - able prestige dating back to the time of the anti-fascist resistance, and ample funds for propaganda, this had led to election results of over 30% of the vote. With respect to the international situation, De Gasperi pointed out that the Italian communists had been greatly strengthened by the lack of unity in the Western world that had been a consequence of Moscow’s ‘peace of - fensive’ after Stalin’s death in 1953. At the time of the Marshall Plan and the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty, the democratic front in Italy had been united. In the 1953 elections the democratic forces were hopelessly divided, opening the door to communist success. 18"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"66 The first Bilderberg conference P aul Nitze, who would become a regular Bilderberg participant, was an in - teresting choice for the American report on communism. 19 Nitze had been di - rector of the State Department’s Policy Planning staff under Se cretary of State Dean Acheson. 20 He was one of the principal authors of NSC 68, a blueprint for American strategy in the Cold War during the Truman Ad ministration and beyond. 21 NSC 68, as Craig and Logevall have put it, called for “a policy of global anti-communism.” 22 It advocated a vast military buildup based on the assumption that “the Soviet Union, unlike previous aspirants to hegem - ony, is animated by a new fanatic faith, anti-thetical to our own, and seeks to impose its absolute authority over the rest of the world.” 23 In NSC 68, Nitze had defined the Cold War as a moral struggle between good and evil, between “slavery” and “freedom.” He argued that the United States should build up a position of strength in order to deter the Soviet Union from further aggres - sion and to prepare the way for an ultimate settlement. Such a program was also needed to reassure the Europeans; after traveling to Eu rope in the late 1940s, Nitze had become convinced that the North Atlantic Treaty on its own was not sufficient to rally US allies in Europe. 24 NSC 68 was presented to President Truman in April 1950. The outbreak of the Korean War two months later ensured that its recommendations were largely accepted. 25 The criticism of Soviet experts George Kennan and Charles Bohlen that NSC 68 exaggerated the expansionist intentions of the Soviet Un ion and put too much emphasis on a military response fell on deaf ears. Nitze was offered a high-ranking position in the Pentagon when the Ei senhower Administration took over, but the offer was rescinded when right-wing media and senators started criticizing Nitze as a big-spending Truman acolyte. 26 Nitze remained an important voice on foreign policy in the Democratic Party, usually in tandem with his friend Dean Acheson. In his Bilderberg paper, Nitze distinguished between American views on communism in general and their specific attitudes towards the Soviet Un ion. While many Americans still felt “considerable respect” for the Ru ssian performance in World War II, “[c]ommunism is regarded as some - thing immoral, which threatens religion, is inhuman toward the individual, is cynically untrustworthy, and challenges all people and nations not under its control.” Nitze repeatedly used terms such as “evil” and “unclean” to characterize how most American s viewed communism. He acknowledged the “near-hysteria over domestic communism” in the United States, but in - dicated that McCarthyism was on the retreat. Nitze implied that the moral rejection of communism had made it difficult for some Americans to reach a realistic assessment of the threat it posed. However, “[t]o the more sophisti - cated [Americans] communism is evil, but only constitutes a threat in so far as it is directed from Moscow and backed by the physical power of Russia and of China.” Speaking at the Bilderberg Hotel, he said: Certainly for the American people the threat is without precedent. During the long century from the Napoleonic wars to the 1st world war, they were"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"The first Bilderberg conference 67 pr otected both by a balance of power in the rest of the world, and by seas controlled by a friendly power, the U.K. Now the seas have shrunk, the world has become polarized, and on top of that totalitarian ideas seem to have progressed in internal consistency and in ruthless efficiency in ac - tion from the demonic ideas of Nazism to the coldly calculated ideas of communism. 27 Despite his passionate rejection of communism, Nitze recognized the ne - cessity of negotiating with the Soviet Union, as did a large majority of Am ericans. But negotiations, he argued, could only be successful from a position of strength. From the American point of view, too many Europeans wanted to negotiate for negotiations’ sake, without being prepared for alter - native courses of action. Nitze concluded by saying that Europeans should realize that for the United States, the threat of Soviet communism always came first. With respect to the German question this meant, for example, that they had little patience for those who worried more about the “German threat” than about the broader Cold War struggle. 28 The different attitudes towards communism that had been identified by Nitze and De Gasperi found confirmation in the subsequent discus - sion. A first dispute concerned the question of whether Western European communist parties were fully under Soviet control. George Perkins, for - mer As sistant Secretary for European Affairs in the State Department, stated flatly that all local communist parties were “agents of Soviet impe - rialism.” When several European participants expressed dissenting views, C. D. Ja ckson explained that in the United States, communism had first and foremost been a matter of espionage. He warned that communist parties in the rest of the world were skilled at posing as national or local politi - cal forces. Yet the danger always remained that they would cooperate with Moscow once they reached a position of power. Representatives of the European democratic Left criticized the American reaction to communism and emphasized social progress as the best method to combat the communist parties in Western Europe. 29 Tom Williamson, General Secretary of the British National Union of General and Municipal Workers, questioned Nitze’s usage of the word “unclean” and insisted that communism in Europe should only be fought with democratic means. His German colleague Ludwig Rosenberg of the Deutsche Gewerkschaftsbund (DGB) supported him, saying that Europe’s “best weapon” was “improved social conditions,” not restrictive legislation. 30 Rosenberg added that the American socioeconomic model could not be applied directly to Europe. In his view, Europe should develop its own vision of the kind of democratic society and economy it wished to create. Among the European masses, de - mocracy should become “a style of living and not just a form of adminis - t r at ion.” 31 Hirschfeld similarly argued that the “free world” had to “find the happy harmony” between the systems of “free enterprise” and “social security” in order to “fight communism.” Max Brauer “again stressed what"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"68 The first Bilderberg conference t he other delegates had already said, that democracy can only improve the standard of living. The elaborate window-display in Western Germany is the best possible anti-communist propaganda.” 32 In contrast, several speakers pointed out how effective communist prop - aganda had been in taking advantage of divisive issues in Europe. Jean Dr apier, chief of staff to Belgian Foreign Minister Paul-Henri Spaak, ex - plained how communists used the German question for this purpose. “Their propaganda,” he said, is based on the desire of the Western European peoples to retain their independence and therefore they encourage fear of the Germans. [T]he Communists in France are stirring up this feeling with unmitigated cru - elty. The French are embittered about the fact that they have lost some of their influence and power and the Communists try to take advantage of their striving for social justice and their fear of war. 33 Denis Healey, a young Labour foreign policy expert, analyzed the differ - ent attitudes towards communism in the context of the world situation. He argued that “[i]n America communism was regarded as a moral evil and an alien thing which had no root in the American sphere at all. [...] In the USA any negotiation with a communist state involved a moral compromise with evil.” In Europe, this was not the case. Here, Healey said, the “prob - lem was to maintain unity when the communists relaxed pressure.” Many Europeans “underestimate[d] the doctrinal elements of Soviet Communism when thinking of possible settlements.” Responding to Soviet Communism, Healey argued, wasn’t simply a matter of “power problems” because com - munism was an expansionist ideology combining “religious fanaticism with imperialism.” Echoing Kennan’s containment strategy, he said that the West should respond by “trying to create forces of social, economic and military strength adequate to keep the peace.” 34 If this strategy was successful, coex - istence with the Soviet Union was possible and Russian imperialism might change in the future. Whether coexistence was possible (or even desirable) was to remain an issue of debate at future Bilderberg meetings. George McGhee reminded the meeting that Secretary of State Dulles had recently said “coexistence was impossible so long as Russia continued her present aggressive policy.” 35 It was clear that Europeans and Americans “haven’t arrived at a commonly agreed estimate of the danger and sense of urgency.” 36 The Bilderberg press release summarized these transatlantic differences in similar terms: America sometimes charges its allies with slowness and undue delib - eration in meeting the Communist threat. European nations some - times feel that the United States is unreasonably impatient. The main difference between the European and American attitude towards the Co mmunist threat is a different sense of timing. Both the Europeans"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"The first Bilderberg conference 69 an d the Americans understand that Communism is not like the weather, against which occasional local precautions can be taken, but that it is an active enemy requiring positive, energetic and steady opposition. McCarthyism was not officially part of the Bilderberg agenda. Yet as Prince Bernhard acknowledged in his opening statement, it was inevitable that Mc Carthyism would come up. To many Europeans, the danger of a right-wing takeover in Washington seemed real at the height of McCarthy’s influence. 37 We now know that at the time of the Bilderberg conference, Mc Carthy was fatally undermining his own position by his abrasive behav - ior during the televised Army-McCarthy hearings, but this turn of events was not yet apparent. Only days before the Bilderberg conference, Mc Carthy had openly challenged President Eisenhower by calling on government em - ployees to report subversion in their ranks directly to him. Obviously, many Europeans were worried about this state of affairs. Throughout the first day of the meeting, European participants criticized McCarthy’s methods and called attention to the negative impact McCarthyism had on European public opinion. As Brauer, who lived in exile in the United States during much of the 1930s and 1940s, said: “[d]emocracy must not be blinded by Mc Carthyism – Europe can take everything from the United States but not that. Freedom and security are the two things we must fight for.” 38 C. D. Jackson noted in his diary that he “became aware of fact that the Europeans had been pathologically eager to discuss McCarthy from the first hour, but each time the name came up it was quickly slurred over.” He also felt that the American response to criticism of the United States was much too timid. He decided, therefore, to request a ‘special session’ on the topic on the last day of the conference. He had the “strong feeling that if [the] meeting broke up without allowing Europeans [the] opportunity to indulge themselves, they would claim Americans had deliberately avoided issue [...]” 39 The McCarthy session indeed did much to clear the air between the European and American participants. Jackson started off with a 15-min ute presentation. According to Alden Hatch, Jackson bluntly said: Whether McCarthy dies by an assassin’s bullet or is eliminated in the normal American way of getting rid of boils on the body politic, I prophesy that by the time we hold our next meeting he will be gone from the American scene. 40 Nitze supported him, saying that it was wrong and unfair to imply, as sev - eral European speakers had done, that a majority of Americans supported McCarthy. “Only a small and diminishing [percentage] of Americans ap - prove of McCarthies [ sic ] methods. The overwhelming majority are dead ag a i n st it.” 41 Jackson noted in his diary that the session was a success – with Oliver Franks whispering “jolly good show” – and indeed, on the subject"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"70 The first Bilderberg conference o f McCarthyism the American participants had made a convincing case. They were confirmed the next morning with newspapers all over the world reporting that President Eisenhower had opened the attack on McCarthy. The transatlantic economy When Retinger and his friends had been preparing their reports on anti- Am ericanism in mid-1952, two issues had stood out in the economic parts of their analysis. First was the overwhelming European dependence on the United States and the ensuing frequent tensions. Hugh Gaitskell had called this Europe’s ‘poor-relation complex.’ The so-called dollar gap was its clear - est expression. It had led to a situation in which the nations receiving the most Marshall Plan aid paradoxically seemed to be most prone to resenting US economic power. The second issue concerned East-West trade and the far-reaching restrictions the United States’ Congress had imposed through the Battle Act. The Bilderberg discussions showed that by the summer of 1954, the eco - nomic situation in Europe had improved significantly, lessening Europe’s dependence on the United States. As the Bilderberg press release put it, “economic factors were no longer such a serious cause of friction between the United States and Europe as they were a few years ago.” Still, East-West trade remained a controversial topic, the dollar gap had not fully disap - peared, and many of the European participants, mindful of the breakdown of the international economic system in the 1930s, still worried about the effects a US recession might have on European economies. On the other hand, the American economic example served as a possible answer to the communist challenge. If only the European nations could achieve the kinds of advances in productivity and economic growth that had made the United States into the world’s economic powerhouse, the socioeconomic sources of communist support would disappear. 42 David Rockefeller was the first to present a report on the state of American- Eu ropean economic relations. Armed with a series of charts, the 38-year- old scion of the Rockefeller family attempted to ease European concerns. The long-term US economic prospects were excellent, he argued, despite the current economic downturn. In view of rising productivity, increasing wages, and faster than expected population growth, the US economy would soon expand again. Moreover, as a result of New Deal reforms, the impor - tant role of the government in the national economy had created a “built-in stability.” A repeat of the Great Depression, in other words, was difficult to imagine. Moreover, the United States’ growing demand for raw materi - als would provide Europe with the opportunity to earn dollars outside of the United States, “which would mean a re-establishment of multi- lat eral t r a d e.” 43 Thus, the dollar gap could disappear even without the assistance of US defense spending and military aid. With respect to free trade, Ro ckefeller noted, the Randall Commission had proposed a series of efforts to lower US"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"The first Bilderberg conference 71 t rade barriers, and the Eisenhower Administration would likely succeed in getting some of these recommendations passed in Congress. Hugh Gaitskell, the author of the European report, agreed with Ro ckefeller that the economic situation had improved and expressed “faith in the enor - mously improved change in the influence of the government and in the tech - niques of economic planning now adopted in the free enterprise economy of the United States.” On the issue of East-West trade, he returned to the impor - tance of emotions and the impact of the Korean War. He understood that to many Americans it was difficult to understand why Great Britain would want to “trade with the enemy.” On the other hand, the Battle Act had created the greatest indignation; it was felt that the United States was using economic power to withhold aid in order to impose a particular foreign policy. He felt this was entirely wrong and that trade restrictions already provided ample fuel for communist propaganda. It was important not to confuse political and economic ide olog y. 44 The president of the British Trade Federation, Sir Harry Pilkington, sup - ported Gaitskell and argued “that East-West trade could be used construc - tively to penetrate the iron curtain and to spread Western ideas on the other side.” Even cold warrior C. D. Jackson had to admit that “economic wa rfare with the East had not been intelligently handled.” Foreshadowing the de cades-long transatlantic dispute on the issue of East-West trade, how - ever, the arguments in favor of trade with the Eastern Bloc came exclusively from European participants. The Bilderberg final report simply expressed the hope that the list of “controlled exports” would be reduced and that East-West trade would no longer create “the considerable propaganda ad - vantage enjoyed by the Communists during the last few years.” 45 The Bilderberg discussions showed a broad consensus in favor of trade liberalization and currency convertibility. On the American side, this was to be expected, given the fact that the Coleman Committee had been founded to support the findings of the Randall Commission in favor of lowering trade barriers. C. D. Jackson added an official voice to Rockefeller’s intro - duction by arguing that the United States needed partners in developing the economic growth of the free world, and the European countries were its natural partners. [...] He was glad to say that in his view there was the beginning of a massive change of opinion in the United States on the subject of import barriers. 46 On the European side, however, the voices in favor of free trade were just as strong. Some of this simply reflected narrow economic interests. The No rwegian shipowner Leif Høegh, for example, criticized the US insistence on using American shipping for at least 50% of its foreign and military aid."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"72 The first Bilderberg conference T he Belgian Pierre Bonvoisin, president of the Banque de la Société Générale de Belgique , complained about the fact that “customs technicalities pre - sented almost insurmountable difficulties for European countries in devel - oping sound and regular trade with the United States.” Meanwhile, both Pirelli and Malagodi emphasized Italy’s demographic problem and argued that other Western countries should either invest more to assist in economic development or allow more immigration from Italy. 47 Beyond such specific issues, however, a broader argument in favor of free trade emerged. Bonvoisin argued that “bilateral trade protected by gov - ernments was relatively easy; but the liberal multi-lateral system of trad - ing, based on efficient private initiative, could be much more successful.” New York was in a position, he added, to take over the role London had played before World War I as a clearinghouse for multilateral trade. The German lawyer and Bilderberg co-founder Rudolf Mueller linked the is - sue to the earlier discussion on communism, arguing: “the primary target was to raise the standard of living of the masses by increasing productivity, which could only be done by bringing about a freer movement of goods, labour and money.” He added that liberalizing the German economy was critical because “on it depended the integration of Germany in Europe.” Pirelli similarly argued that in the struggle to ensure economic growth “a primary remedy would be the unification of Europe.” 48 The Bilderberg consensus on trade and increasing productivity was im - portant precisely because of this connection with European integration. In the summer of 1954, the European project was still concerned with the EDC. Soon, however, the EDC was put to rest by the French Assembly, and European integration took a different course, leading to the Rome Treaties establishing the Common Market. A significant number of Bilderberg par - ticipants would play both leading and supporting roles in these events. Decolonization Barry Bingham, the owner of the Courier-Journal and the Louisville Times and a former Marshall Plan chief in France, had written the US report on the “Problem of Overseas Territories.” Bingham argued that on the question of decolonization, “[e]motion and reason [...] were in conflict, both in Eur ope and in America.” On the US side, a long tradition of anti- co lonialism had caused “a strong and traditional feeling that colonial people should be free.” On the other hand, the dangers of “too sudden liberation” had become clear to the American public over the past few years. In Europe, Bingham said, “the pull of emotion, in which national pride was involved, worked in the sense of keeping the colonials under European guidance. Reason, on the other hand, had shown the dangers of too tight a hold.” The key issue, there - fore, was one of timing. Bingham argued that the European colonial powers should ensure a “steady movement toward independence,” otherwise “the great Nationalist storm” would lead to chaos and violence. 49 The United"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"The first Bilderberg conference 73 S tates might play a role as mediator between the colonial powers and their overseas territories. In the case of Indochina, Bingham argued, this meant that France should declare that full independence would await the nations of French Indochina once order had been restored. The response to Bingham’s introduction fell mainly into two camps: those who defended the colonial powers and argued for patience and those who agreed that colonialism was a thing of the past. The French MP and diplomat Jean-Michel Guérin de Beaumont belonged to the former group and ridiculed Bingham’s suggestion that the United States could play the role of mediator. “The United States themselves,” de Beaumont remarked sarcastically, solved the problem of the Indians in the spirit of the time, i.e. - we have to admit it - by eliminating the Indians, but this method can no longer be applied to-day. [...] It is to be feared that Mr. Bingham will have great difficulty in his own country in fighting against the anti- col onialist mentality, which has been firmly established for such a long time in the minds of his compatriots. 50 With respect to Indochina, de Beaumont argued that it was difficult to explain to the man in the street why France was fighting a war to end its colonial empire. According to Rijkens, de Beaumont’s remarks reflected Eu ropean frustration with the sanctimonious attitude on the part of some of the American participants and did much to clear the air. 51 The British Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, John Fos ter, added that in the United States, “politics and emotionalism” shaped anti- co lonial attitudes. The British did not question the necessity to “bring colo - nial countries to independence.” However, “the issue was not so much one of colonialism and anti-colonialism but one of tempo.” The key test was “the country’s ability at self-rule.” 52 On the other side of the debate, people like the Norwegian politician Finn Moe and the German trade union leader Ludwig Rosenberg argued that im - patience on the part of the colonial peoples was understandable and opened the door for communist propaganda. As Moe put it, if America at the time of her independence, Belgium in the beginning of the last century, Czecho-Slovakia in the first World War, or Norway in 1905 had been told their independence was premature [...] they would all have reacted in the same way. If underdeveloped countries were given premature independence, there was a risk of Communism, but if they were kept in a state of dependence, the danger of Communism was far greater, as those countries would look towards Communism to satisfy their strong desire for independence. 53 Rosenberg similarly argued that it was “dangerous to allow the communists to be the prime champions of freedom for the colonial peoples.” 54 In terms"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"74 The first Bilderberg conference o f practical approaches to the problem, he explained that European and American trade unions had cooperated to set up trade union schools in the underdeveloped world. On the American side, C. D. Jackson emphasized that the United States could not afford to stay out of colonial conflicts since they inevitably in - volved “the military security of the United States.” He could understand why many Europeans distrusted the United States; still, he argued, “A merica had evolved since Wilsonian self-determination, and had gone a long way since the time when every black with a tommy-gun was looked upon as a potential George Washington.” From the American point of view, it was clear that there was a trend towards freedom, and colonial powers could either keep the lid on it, which was a bloody and unlasting [sic] solution, al - low chaos to spread, or organise an evolutionary development ending in liberty for the native populations and economic advantages for the ex-colonial powers. 55 The difficulty of organizing such an “evolutionary development” was clear to all. In the words of George Ball, it was “continuously necessary to strike a balance between political independence and the clear danger that it will mean temporary or long-term losses to the indigenous people themselves, since they may be worse off after independence.” 56 Ball suggested that technical training and other ways of preparing dependent areas for self- go vernment was crucial and was supported in this view by other partic - ipants. Indeed, the strong focus on development and modernization that would characterize US and European strategy toward the Third World dur - ing much of the Cold War was already apparent in the thinking of many Bilderberg participants. 57 What was also clear, however, was that striking the kind of balance that Ball was talking about was made all the more difficult because of the Cold War. The Indochina crisis demonstrated how Cold War pressures tended to hinder a joint Western strategy. Sir Robert Boothby lamented “that in re - cent weeks the West had been faced with a break-down of Western policies, and what amounted to a temporary collapse of the Western Alliance, which had produced the gravest results.” Sir Oliver Franks warned that the United States’ strong focus on military solutions risked ignoring the political di- mension. As he put it, although it might be possible to win battles in S.E. Asia and Indo- Ch ina, the aftermath of such battles might mean the loss of 500,000,000 souls to communism if social and political aspects of the problem were ignored. Political judgment was vital to the successful conduct of affairs in those countries and was complementary to the military aspect. 58"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"The first Bilderberg conference 75 Fr anks’ warning reflected high-level thinking in the British government; at the same time, it was a response to Admiral Carney’s speech and to Am erican Bilderberg participants, such as Gardner Cowles, who had called for quick common action in Indochina. 59 Franks’ words did not miss their mark: several participants underlined the importance of his intervention and he was quoted verbatim in the Bilderberg press release. European integration After two days of intense discussions on communism, decolonization, and economic issues, the time had come to talk about European integration. The topic had been broached several times in the previous discussions, re - flecting the fact that a number of participants regarded a united Europe as the solution to many of the problems facing the West. In terms of improving social conditions, a united Europe promised increased trade, productivity, and economic growth; in terms of the ideological Cold War, Europe could serve as a beacon of hope to capture the imagination of people around the continent; in terms of decolonization, Europe could absorb the loss of over - seas markets; in terms of transatlantic economic relations, only a united Europe would be able to compete with the United States. The Bilderberg meeting, however, took place at a trying time for supporters of European integration. The EDC – and with it the Political Co mmunity – was in serious trouble. The EDC treaty had been signed by France, Italy, West Germany, and the Benelux countries in 1952, yet two years later the treaty still had not been ratified in France and Italy. In August 1954, two months after the Bilderberg conference, the EDC would finally be voted down in the French assembly. Until that moment, the Eisenhower Adminis - tration had strongly supported the EDC and regarded it not only as the best way to accomplish German rearmament, but, even more importantly, as a crucial step towards Franco-German reconciliation. President Ei senhower and Secretary of State Dulles were convinced that only the surrender of national sovereignties to a supranational authority would be a reliable safe - guard to prevent future conflicts between the two countries. Moreover, a unified Europe would be responsible for its own defense, thereby relieving the Americans of a heavy financial burden. 60 In France, opposition to the EDC defied party lines and united Com munists, Gaullists, and much of what came in between. 61 Hostility to the EDC was based on a number of reasons. The obvious aversion to rearming Ge rmany was strengthened by the fear that Germany would quickly come to dominate the EDC. The French army was severely weakened by the war in Indochina and tensions in Algeria, and Great Britain consistently refused to become a member of the EDC as a counterweight to Germany. Meanwhile, the strong American pressure for the EDC was widely resented. John Foster Dulles’ threat of an “agonizing reappraisal” at the December 1953 NATO meeting had been just as counterproductive as the decision by Congress to make military"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"76 The first Bilderberg conference a id dependent on ratification of the EDC. 62 Finally, the fact that the EDC treaty abolished France’s ability to develop its own nuclear force seems to have played an important role outside the public discourse. 63 The tumultuous affair over an unauthorized speech critical of the EDC by Marshal Alphonse Juin and the subsequent decision by the Laniel gov - ernment to relieve him of all his functions had shown the extent to which the EDC had torn the nation apart. During the controversy, a majority of the Socialist members of Parliament released a bombshell statement saying that they would vote against the pro-EDC party line. The rebellion was not limited to backbenchers; it included former Defense Minister Jules Moch and other prominent Socialists. In light of this development, it seemed less likely than ever that Premier Joseph Laniel would be able to obtain a ma - jority for the EDC. The French crisis had left its mark on the French representation at Bi lderberg. The most important absentee was Guy Mollet, whose presence was needed at a special Socialist Party congress on the EDC. Pi erre-Henri Teitgen was also prevented from coming because of a Mouvement Ré publicain Populaire congress on the same subject. Mollet, the secretary-general of the Socialist Party, was a strong supporter of the EDC and had started a cam - paign to get the mutinous anti-EDC faction back into line. In a paper writ - ten for the Bilderberg conference, Mollet explained the difficulty of this task. Communist propaganda had framed the debate in terms of a loss of French sovereignty in exchange for a revival of German militarism. In addition, the public perceptions of the Soviet threat had changed since the death of Stalin and the armistice in Korea. As Mollet said: “The ‘German Men ace’ has simply taken precedent, for some, over the Russian menace [...].” Urging reticence on the part of Washington, Mollet stated that [...] there is no doubt that any pressure from outside, any sign of im - patience on the side of our allies [...], tends to provoke unfavourable re actions, to hurt national pride, and, as a result, to play into the ene - mies’ hand. 64 Every impression that the EDC was an American project had to be prevented. 65 Apart from the French difficulties over the EDC, the Bilderberg discus - sion was characterized by a solid consensus on European integration. The question was not so much whether to pursue some form of European unity but how to do so. Of course, Retinger, Van Zeeland, Prince Bernhard, and other organizers of the Bilderberg conference were well-known supporters of the European idea. Many of the participants they had invited shared their pro-European mindset. Quite a few of the Americans, moreover, were former diplomats or Marshall Planners who had been exposed to the pro-European thinking at the State Department. The broad pro-European consensus, in other words, did not come as a surprise. Most dissenting voices, as so often when it concerned Europe, came from the British participants."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"The first Bilderberg conference 77 Ge orge Ball had been asked to outline American attitudes towards Eu ropean integration. Ball was careful not to prescribe any particular form of integration. Addressing a common European criticism, Ball stated that although the American federal experience certainly influenced American thinking, “informed Americans” recognized the differences between the situation in Western Europe and in colonial America. He emphasized that it was the European experience of the last 50 years that had led Americans to “reject old formulas as totally inadequate”: Since a continuation of the past experience of Europe with its national rivalries and wars can lead to nothing but disaster, a new formula for organizing Europe must be found – and no really new formula has been suggested except unification in some kind of federal system. Alliances, agreements, international organizations, balance-of-power arrange - ments, all are mere variations on old and unsatisfactory themes. Next, Ball addressed the “fear that the political unity may conduce to an insipid cultural uniformity.” This part of his statement was aimed at those who feared a predominantly catholic and conservative ‘Little Europe.’ He said that many Europeans probably overestimated the cultural uniform - ity of the United States. He tried to set their minds at rest by arguing that political unification would lead to a “cross-fertilization of cultures” not a “cross- st erilization.” Technological developments in communications were a far more important factor in the process of “cultural standardization.” 66 Ball ended by stating that an Atlantic community that united Europe and the United States with a supranational authority was not yet realistic. Su pporters of some form of Atlantic unity had to understand that European unification was a precondition for any such development in the future. Ball’s statement was well received, and several of his formulations were used almost verbatim in the press release after the Bilderberg conference. 67 Not all Americans, however, were as finely attuned to European sensibilities. James Zellerbach, former chief of the Marshall Plan organization in Italy, pointed to the impatient mood in Congress and the possible repercussions of a French failure to ratify the EDC. He did not use the term “agonizing reappraisal,” but warned “that there was a strong feeling that if Europe were unwilling to defend herself, the United States should not assume that responsibility.” 68 C. D. Jackson argued that Soviet opposition to the EDC was another reason to proceed quickly: “What the Soviets feared they respected, and what they respected the West should ratify.” 69 George Perkins added that [i]t was possible that one of the reasons for which the Russians had agreed to the truce [in Korea, TWG] was that it would deaden the sense of urgency for Western re-armament, and slow down or even put an end to the creation of the E.D.C. In the American view such a result would be disastrous, since in fact the Russian threat remained the same as before Korea. 70"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"78 The first Bilderberg conference I n reaction, several European participants urged the Americans to be pa - tient. Belgian Senator Etienne de la Vallée Pousin, who had been responsible for the European report, said the United States should forcefully support European integration, yet “at the same time leav[e] Europe more responsi - bility in the realization.” Italian Senator Cafiero pointed out that the tone of Zellerbach’s contribution had been that of a “governess to bad boys.” 71 It was exactly this type of language that caused anti-American resentment in Europe. Jean Drapier, the Belgian socialist, also argued that Europe itself should fight this battle – without US interference. On a more positive note, Drapier was able to inform the meeting that at the Socialist Party congress, Mollet had secured a positive vote on the EDC question. One thing the European and American participants could agree on was that the prospect of a united Europe promised a solution to both the Ge rman question and the communist challenge. In the Cold War language of the final Bilderberg report, European unity in some form has long been a Utopian dream, but the conference was agreed that it is now a necessity of our times. Only thus can the free nations of Europe achieve a moral and material strength capable of meeting any threat to their freedom. Or as André Voisin had put it succinctly during the discussion on communism, “the best obstacle to Communism is the idea of the European union.” In his report on European unity, Senator de la Vallée Pousin strongly supported this position, saying: It must be clearly pointed out that the European Union is probably Europe’s best weapon against Communism. The United States regard Communism as Russian Imperialism but in Europe it must not be over - looked that in the eyes of a great number of people Communism repre - sents a new gospel, that is, not just the solution to economic problems but to all problems. [...] It follows that one can only fight one religious idea with another and on this point Europe does not have a common front. The idea of “Europe” is exactly the idea around which Europe could rally as long as she put it over as a great hope. 72 Max Brauer also made a passionate appeal for European unity, linking it to the German question. “A United States of Europe,” he argued, “represented the only way to safeguard peace.” The unification of Germany should be achieved “within the framework of a united Europe.” Denis de Ro ugemont added that not only in Germany but also in France, Belgium, and the Ne therlands, large majorities of the population were in favor of European unity. Even Soviet for - eign minister Molotov could no longer “openly oppose” the idea of a united Europe and had made a counterproposal for a Europe including Russia and Eastern European at the Berlin conference in early 1954."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"The first Bilderberg conference 79 Co ncerning the fears of cultural “standardization” mentioned by Ball, de Rougemont offered the example of Switzerland, where after 106 years of union, the different cantons and regions remained “different in language, dialect, religion and way of living.” A European Union was necessary, de Rougemont argued, to assure “Europe’s independence.” If supported by the United States, such a union would “help to strengthen the Atlantic alliance.” 73 Emotions, anti-communism, and the West Throughout the three days of discussions at the Bilderberg Hotel, the im - portance of emotions in transatlantic relations was stressed time and time again. 74 Many of these emotions, ranging from fear to jealousy, pride, or im - patience, tended to complicate the transatlantic relationship. One takeaway was that the United States, in particular, needed to consider these emotions in order to be an effective leader of the Atlantic alliance. The kind of over - bearing diplomacy that Secretary of State Dulles sometimes engaged in was counterproductive precisely because it clashed with national sensibilities and emotions. On the other hand, the Bilderberg meeting also showed that a subtler kind of American leadership could rely on a strong groundswell of support among Atlanticist European elites. Indeed, the explicit willingness to discuss the ‘negative’ emotions hampering transatlantic relations reflected a set of ‘positive’ emotions underlying support for the Atlantic alliance. In part, these positive emotions were simply implicit in the fact that busy men took the time to get together for a long weekend of discussions. But they also found expression in frequent calls for transatlantic unity. Rh etor ic al ly, these calls relied first and foremost on anti-communism and shared Cold War threat perceptions. 75 They boiled down to the proposition that Wes ter n unity meant that the West stood a better chance of deterring the Soviet Un ion. At the same time, calls for unity appealed to a set of values and his - torical memories that allowed the Bilderberg participants to identify as part of an emotional community loosely defined as ‘the West’, ‘the Free World’, or ‘the Atlantic Community.’ 76 As with any imagined community, this com - munity continuously had to adapt to changing circumstances. The concept of the West or the Free World also carried different meanings for the dif - ferent people and groups that identified with it. Still, the calls for unity and the appeal to a sense of community and kinship encouraged the Bilderberg participants to engage in dialogues of cooperation, not just recrimination, thus undergirding a worldview in which the Atlantic alliance was more – or aspired to be more – than a narrow defensive alliance. 77 How this worked in practice at the Bilderberg conference was evident in the rhetoric of the Bilderberg organizers. Prince Bernhard had started the conference by drawing attention to the civilizational and cultural roots of transatlantic cooperation and the necessity for a new type of in ternationalism – a “new way of thinking.” Other Bilderberg organizers of the first hour"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"80 The first Bilderberg conference f ollowed up with similar calls for unity. Hugh Gaitskell, for example, warned that “ [i]f relations were bad, the Alliance would break up and the Soviet Union would be encouraged in its aim for world- dom ination.” Max Brauer, using more positive language to define the purpose of the West, declared that “[t]he task of the Western Alliance was to ensure the freedom of all men and to give them a sense of security to face the future.” The former Danish Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ole Bjørn Kraft, another member of Retinger’s original committee, said during the discussion on decolonization that “the freedom and future of Europe was as much at stake as that of the colonial territories. The world was divided into two hostile camps between which a line of balance would have to be found.” 78 Paul van Zeeland, in another typical example, spoke of “a fundamental solidarity between Europe and America” and of “a common ideal based on liberty and the respect of the human personality.” In face of the communist challenge, he argued, “we are all in [the] same boat and will sink or swim to - g et he r.” 79 Van Zeeland, who as a conservative Catholic was deeply involved in various anti-communist organizations, also relied on religion to strengthen the sense of community at the Bilderberg conference. 80 Presiding over the Sa turday afternoon session, he announced that Prince Bernhard had received a letter signed by four clergymen informing the delegates that they had said a prayer to ask for God’s help so that the efforts of the impor - tant personalities here present should lead to a positive contribution to world peace. The President added that in acting jointly these four cler - gymen have provided an example of understanding and intelligence and he hoped that everyone here present would bear this lesson in mind. 81 The Belgian politician Roger Motz, meanwhile, formulated a European ver - sion of the domino theory and argued that “it has to be realized that if Italy becomes Communist, the whole Western European bulwark against Com - munism will collapse. Therefore the questions which are now worrying Italy concern the whole of Europe.” 82 This kind of rhetoric aimed at defining the West as a common space of freedom in opposition to a Soviet-dominated ‘other.’ The fact that both so - cial democrats and conservatives were able to rely on analogous rhetorical practices illustrates the integrative power of anti-communism when it was combined with the idea that the ‘West’ or the ‘Free World’ was held together by certain common ideals, values, and historical experiences. 83 Even if the Bilderberg participants did not agree on the question of how to deal with communism, they did agree on the seriousness of the threat posed by inter - national communism and on the need for cooperation amongst the nations of the West. In the words of Denis Healey, We must maintain the policies of the free nations as expressed in NATO, and build up on the side of the free peoples moral, social and military"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"The first Bilderberg conference 81 fo rces sufficient to discourage aggression. To do this requires collabo - ration between Europe and America at the highest and most effective level. There must be real confidence and reciprocal comprehension. 84 The Bilderberg press release shows how the Bilderberg organizers also used anti-communism and the language of community to legitimize the Bi lderberg Group. “The peoples of the free nations of Western Europe and the United States,” the press release announced, are in full agreement that the combination of Communist ideology and Soviet military power is the paramount threat to individual freedom and free institutions. Faced with the threat of aggressive Communism, the Western nations are in the same boat, although it is a boat with sev - eral decks; if the boat sinks all will go down together. The press release went on to argue that transatlantic differences and disa - greements were inevitable but needed to be addressed and understood. Criticism, which is an essential ingredient of a healthy democratic so - ciety, must also be an ingredient of a healthy democratic alliance. The democratic nature of the alliance of the West is both its strength and its weakness. Since the Western nations cannot act through compulsion or regimentation, progress is sometimes delayed, yet the fact that the We stern alliance functions through the free consent of all members en - dows it with a moral and spiritual unity. 85 The language of community added an emotional element to the rational arguments in favor of transatlantic cooperation. As a result, those who identified with an Atlantic community were arguably more willing to en - gage in constructive debate and “mutual responsiveness,” to use a con - cept developed by Karl Deutsch; they recognized that divergent attitudes and perceptions needed to be taken into account in the context of “a healthy democratic alliance.” 86 As Rockefeller put it to Gaitskell after the conference, I believe that conferences such as the one we attended can be helpful in bringing out and explaining the reasons for our differences which, in turn, tend to reduce feelings of resentment and mistrust even though they may not bring about a complete meeting of minds. From this point of view I felt the Conference was extremely valuable. Paul van Zeeland resorted to the word “goodwill” to describe the effect of the discussions. “A lot of home-truths had been said,” Van Zeeland re - marked, “during the debates of these two days which have not always been pleasant to listen to. But they have always been accepted with goodwill.” 87"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"82 The first Bilderberg conference O f course, imagining a Western community in opposition to a Soviet- dom inated, communist other was nothing new. What was new, however, was that this imagining took place in a transnational, bipartisan, and infor - mal setting, connecting trade unionists and business leaders, socialists and conservatives, intellectuals and technocrats. Loyalties to nation, class, or party were shown to be compatible with loyalty to a transnational Western community. As Federico Romero has put it, “anti-communism functioned as the catalyst of a complex process of cultural and political foundation of t he We st.” 88 In Johannes Großmann’s recent typology of anti-communism – which distinguishes between anti-communism as (1) a worldview expressed in certain ideas and rhetorical practices, (2) a political reality, and (3) a so cial movement – the Bilderberg Group seems mainly important in the first ca tegory. 89 How the ideas and emotions expressed at the Bilderberg conference translated back into national political systems and movements depended to a large degree on the individual participants. The global mindset of most Bilderberg participants reinforced their dis - position towards cooperation. If there was one broadly shared consensus underlying the whole conference, it was that the challenges of the postwar world – communism, economic development, decolonization, military de - fense, globalization, the German question, Europe’s future – could not be met by any nation in isolation. As Prince Bernhard had put it at the start of the Bilderberg conference, “the inter-dependence of the Western coun - tries makes interest in one’s neighbour’s affairs not only natural but nec - essary and vital.” Most participants, moreover, would have agreed that the United States as a ‘European’ power had an important role to play in facing these challenges– they were Atlanticists, in other words, as well as internationalists. All of this meant that despite all the irritations and conflicting emotions that came to the surface at the Bilderberg conference, the necessity for trans - atlantic cooperation was uncontested. This was important, because during this new phase in the relations between Europe and the United States, as Cyrus Sulzberger put it, “Europe’s reactions whether soundly based or not, are an all-important element in political calculations. Europe has now re - covered sufficiently from post-war anemia to have a definite influence in the world-power scales.” 90 How Europe would bring this influence to bear, and with what consequences for the Atlantic alliance was a key question that would continue to occupy the Bilderberg meetings for years to come.

Regardless of what else comes out of the Conference, it was justified, in my opinion, on the basis of the opportunity to meet and talk with so many interest - ing and leading personalities from all parts of Europe. Certainly as an American, I felt that I came away from the Conference with a far clearer understanding of the reasons for European attitudes on issues which have caused misunderstandings between Europe and the United States. 1 With similar letters arriving from many other European and American par - ticipants, this much was clear: the Bilderberg conference had served a useful purpose, and the format of informal, high-level transatlantic discussions had been well chosen. 2 As a result, John Coleman urged Prince Bernhard to con - tinue the group’s work: “[...] all of us learned a great deal, and we came away convinced that a way must be found to continue what you have so success - fully launched.” 3 Retinger and his fellow organizers likewise concluded that the first Bilderberg Conference proved that understanding between Americans and Europeans can be brought about on all the important problems of the day, and that it is possible to reach a reasonable agree - ment whenever the difficulty is due to a basic difference in tradition or mentality. The Conference applied itself to the study of the different ap - proaches to these problems and not to the problems themselves. It never tried to assume the responsibility of a policy-making body. Thus, it was easier to arrive at a better mutual comprehension, and at the same time much light was shed on all these problems, which is needed to ensure the good working of the Western partnership of peoples. 4 In September 1954, George Ball, John Coleman, Gardner Cowles, Jack Heinz, C. D. Jackson, George Nebolsine, and Paul Nitze joined Retinger for a meeting in New York City, and all agreed that “a second Conference 4 Organization, membership, an d the informal alliance"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"88 Organization and membership s hould be held as soon as feasible.” 5 It took place in Barbizon, near Paris, in March 1955 and was followed later that year by another Bilderberg conference, in the Bavarian mountain resort Garmisch-Partenkirchen, in Se ptember. By now the Bilderberg Group had become an established or - ganization and a fourth conference took place in May 1956 in Fredensborg, Denmark; in 1957, the Bilderberg Group organized two more meetings: one in Fe bruary in St. Simons Island, Georgia , the United States, and the other in Oc tober in Fiuggi, Italy. After 1957, one annual Bilderberg conference became the regular pattern, sometimes complemented by so-called enlarged steering committee meetings to discuss urgent issues such as the Berlin cri - sis or the European Free Trade Area. The success of the first Bilderberg conference also finally removed the Eisenhower Administration’s initial reluctance to become involved. C. D. Jackson told the White House and Bedell Smith that Bilderberg was “a good and highly useful endeavour, definitely to be cooperated with.” 6 President Eisenhower now informed Prince Bernhard that he supported a second Bilderberg meeting: “I think that such a meeting would be useful if really functional or action items can be included in the agenda.” 7 Allen Dulles had made a similar suggestion to Retinger. 8 High-ranking US offi - cials such as Deputy Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Robert Murphy and White House economic advisor Gabriel Hauge became fre - quent participants, and the State Department no longer objected to ‘official’ US participation. After a French newspaper close to Prime Minister Pierre Mendès-France had criticized the 1955 conference in Barbizon, C. Burke Elbrick at the Division of European Affairs even concluded: In view of the evident value of the frank and personal discussions made possible by these meetings and in view of the fact that representation from other countries has usually been top-notch, I do not believe that U.S. participants should be inhibited by trivial press criticisms. 9 At NATO headquarters in Paris, word also quickly spread about the merits of the Bilderberg Group. After participating in the September 1955 Bi lderberg meeting, NATO Secretary-General Lord Ismay informed the NATO coun - cil about “the useful purposes served by this conference and the excellent chairmanship of Prince Bernhard.” 10 Privately, he told NATO’s Su preme Allied Commander Europe ( SACEU R ) General Alfred Gr uenther: “I am glad that we went to Garmisch not only because I thoroughly enjoyed it but because I feel it was good for N.A.T.O.” 11 This chapter takes a closer look at the institutionalization of the Bi lderberg Group. The first part examines Bilderberg’s organizational structures: its leadership, steering committee, membership, and finances. In the next part, the cases of Bilderberg members Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski illustrate how informal diplomacy and transnational networks changed the nature and composition of the transatlantic foreign policy elite.

The resulting Bilderberg or - ganization came to consist of a steering committee, two honorary secretary- ge nerals in Europe and the United States, two American chairmen, and Prince Bernhard as chairman in Europe. Prince Bernhard continued to serve in this role until 1977, when he was forced to resign because of the Lockheed scandal. 12 Prince Bernhard had a talent for chairing the meetings, possessing not just the necessary charm and tact to lead the sometimes-heated debates, but also the ability to summarize complex discussions. 13 The Dutch gov - ernment, moreover, supported his chairmanship, despite objections on the part of his wife. During the so-called ‘Hofmans affair,’ revolving around the influence of the faith healer Greet Hofmans on Queen Juliana, the royal family lived in a “state of war,” as Bernhard later called it. 14 Prodded on by Hofmans – who, as a convinced pacifist, was no fan of NATO – the Queen told Prime Minister Willem Drees that she objected to Bernhard’s chair - manship of Bilderberg and to his frequent travels abroad. 15 Pointing to the political character of the Bilderberg conferences and to the press coverage of the September 1955 conference at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, she asked Drees to intervene in order to protect the royal family. Prime Minister Drees and his cabinet refused. Drees told the Queen that if the cabinet felt that the activities of a member of the royal family affected the position of the head of state, their only course of action was to call on the Queen to try to end this behavior. 16 Yet in this case the cabinet did not object to Prince Bernhard’s activities. In fact, Drees and Minister of Foreign Affairs Johan Willem Beyen, both Atlanticists and, particularly in the case of Beyen, advocates for European integration, supported the overall aim of the Bilderberg meetings. Beyen noted in October 1955 that the level of the participants was high and that they “obviously appreciate” the meetings. 17 Beyen, who had a friendly relationship with Bernhard, even contributed a paper on European integration to the second 1955 Bilderberg conference. Prince Bernhard, for his part, kept the foreign ministry fully informed about the meetings and sometimes used his Bilderberg connections to advance Dutch economic interests. 18 He also accepted the presence of Eelco van Kleffens at the Bilderberg conferences as an informal representative for the government, a role later played by Minister of Foreign Affairs Joseph Luns. Bilderberg’s founding father Joseph Retinger served as the group’s first European honorary secretary-general until shortly before his death in 1960."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"90 Organization and membership H e continued to travel frequently to meet with Bilderberg members and to scout for new participants, assisted by his secretary, John Pomian and by Lieutenant General Terence Airey, a former British military intelligence of - ficer. From mid-1957 onwards, however, Retinger’s declining health made it more and more difficult for him to do so. 19 The Dutchman Ernst van der Beugel, vice president of KLM and a former deputy foreign minister, succeeded Retinger in 1960 and served as honorary secretary-general until 1980, assisted by the Dutch diplomat Arnold Lamping. Paul Rijkens served as Bilderberg’s first treasurer and was succeeded in 1964 by the chairman of AKU (later AKZO), Johannes Meynen. On the other side of the Atlantic, John Coleman resigned as American chairman in late 1954 after suffering a heart attack. 20 Prince Bernhard, C. D. Jackson, and David Rockefeller approached several potential succes - sors, starting with Arthur H. Dean and David Bruce. When they declined, Rockefeller and Jackson urged Dean Rusk, the president of the Rockefel - ler Foundation, to take the job. The combined pressure from the White House – President Eisenhower also put in a word – and one of the most in - fluential Rockefeller Foundation trustees did the trick. 21 Rusk agreed to be - come American chairman of the Bilderberg Group, joined by Walter Bedell Smith as co-chairman. Prince Bernhard “expressed his keen satisfaction” with this solution. 22 Rusk and Bedell Smith were succeeded in 1957 by Jack Heinz and Arthur Dean, a prominent international lawyer at Sullivan and Cr omwell and chief negotiator of the Korean Armistice Agreement. Joseph E. Johnson, the president of the Carnegie Endowment for Inter - national Peace (CEIP), agreed to become the American honorary secretary- ge neral and remained so until 1976. Johnson was a former Williams College history professor who had served as chief of the State Department’s Divi - sion of International Security Affairs during the war. He was also a well- co nnected director of the Council on Foreign Relations, where he served on the same membership committee as David Rockefeller. The Carnegie Endowment provided him with secretarial support and acted as a clearing - house for financial contributions to the Bilderberg Group. 23 The steering committee The Bilderberg steering committee was formed to assist in planning the meetings, selecting participants, and raising funds. Since the Bilderberg meetings took place in different countries each year, steering committee members were also involved in the organization of the meeting when it took place in their home country. Retinger’s original 1952 committee formed the backbone of Bilderberg’s steering committee, although membership in the steering committee fluctuated over the years. During the 1950s, the steering committee met around four times per year. Three or four members partici- pated for the larger countries and one or two for the smaller. In the United States, the number was larger, but since most committee meetings took place"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Organization and membership 91 in E urope, US members were not always able to participate. In addition to Joseph Johnson and the American chairmen, US members were George Ball, Emilio Collado, John Ferguson, Gabriel Hauge, C. D. Ja ckson, Robert Murphy, George Nebolsine, James Rockefeller, Shepard Stone, and James Zellerbach. European members of the steering committee included Otto Wolff von Amerongen, Fritz Erler, Rudolf Mueller, and Carlo Schmid in Germany; Hugh Gaitskell, Denis Healey, Reginald Maudling, and Victor Cavendish- Be ntinck in the United Kingdom; Pinay and Mollet in France; Pietro Qu aroni in Italy; the industrialist Walter Boveri in Switzerland; the diplo - mat M. Nuri Birgi in Turkey; the banker Charles C. Arliotis in Greece; Paul van Zeeland in Belgium; Leif Høegh and politician Jens Christian Hauge in Norway; the journalist Terkel M. Terkelsen in Denmark; and the prominent banker Marcus Wallenberg in Sweden. At the first Bilderberg meeting, NATO members Canada and Turkey had not been represented, but this changed in 1955. Prince Bernhard approached Secretary of State for External Affairs Lester Pearson in late 1954 and asked for permission to invite the Canadian Ambassador to Italy, Pierre Dupuy, to the second conference. Pearson agreed and asked Bernhard to also in - vite the diplomat Norman A. Robertson. The Canadian businessman James S. Duncan became a steering committee member in 1959. Pearson himself participated in three Bilderberg meetings in the 1960s, as did Paul Martin, another liberal Secretary of State for External Affairs. The first Bilderberg meeting to take place in Canada was in 1961, in St. Castin, Quebec. Starting in 1957, Turkey was mainly represented by the diplomat M. Nuri Birgi and hosted the 1959 Bilderberg meeting in Ye ş ilköy, Istanbul. Just six months later, Prime Minister Adnan Menderes, who had been present at the Bilderberg Meeting, was deposed in a military coup and executed. Although these events were not directly connected to the Bilderberg conference, they did illustrate the difficulty of dealing with NATO’s nondemocratic mem - bers. An invitation to organize the 1964 Bilderberg conference in Portugal was rejected after several socialist Bilderberg members, including Norway’s long-time Minister of Foreign Affairs Halvard Lange, called attention to the nature of Portugal’s regime. 24 The Bilderberg organizers decided to can - cel the Bilderberg conference in Greece in 1968 after the military junta had taken power in 1967. 25 In 1957, with Retinger’s health deteriorating, a small working group was formed to assist Retinger and Prince Bernhard in preparing the conferences. The members of this working group were Johnson, Jens Hauge, Mueller, Ri jkens, and Quaroni. In 1959, the steering committee had become too large to meet more than once a year and the working group was reorganized into a small advisory committee. After van der Beugel took over from Retinger, the advisory committee was enlarged and now also included the Governor of the Central Bank of France Wilfrid Baumgartner, Cavendish-Bentinck, Boveri, Christiansen, Healey, Høegh, Valletta, and Wallenberg."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"92 Organization and membership I n the early 1960s, the Bilderberg leaders started to consider ways of bringing in new and younger members. 26 Since steering committee mem - bers were automatically invited to each conference, the fact that the com - mittee now boasted more than 30 members severely limited the possibility of inviting new participants. This led to the decision in 1964 to create a smaller steering committee and to abolish the advisory committee. 27 Old Bilderberg hands such as Gubbins, Mueller, Pinay, Quaroni, Schmid, and van Zeeland made way for a new generation of steering committee members including Gianni Agnelli, Baumgartner, conservative MP Sir Frederick Bennett, Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) foreign policy expert Fritz Erler (succeeded by Helmut Schmidt after Erler’s death in 1967), the Canadian banker Anthony Griffin, the Belgian diplomat Jean-Charles Snoy et d’O ppuers , and Healey’s Private Parliamentary Secretary Dick Taverne (Healey had become Secretary of State for Defence in the Harold Wilson government in 1964 and returned to the steering committee in 1970). Financing Bilderberg In Europe, the steering committee members were responsible for securing a modest yearly national contribution to cover Bilderberg’s overhead costs. 28 Those members who did not have the necessary financial means themselves usually sought assistance from industrialists or bankers. Paul van Zeeland and Prince Bernhard, for example, convinced the Comte Jean-Pierre de Launoit, president of the Groupe Bruxelles Lambert , to create a fund in sup - port of the Bilderberg Group in Belgium. 29 Otto Wolff von Amerongen and Rudolf Mueller took care of the German contribution; Paul Rijkens was re - sponsible for the Dutch contribution. He asked a similar group of firms that had sponsored the first Bilderberg conference to contribute to the running costs of Bilderberg in 1961, as did his successor Meynen in 1966. 30 The cost of the conferences themselves was partly covered by large corpo - rations, foundations, and wealthy members in the hosting country. Antoine Pinay, for example, arranged to cover the hotel costs for the 1955 meeting in Barbizon, as did Wolff and Mueller for the Garmisch-Partenkirchen con - ference. 31 Wolff himself contributed 10,000 deutschmark and arranged fur - ther contributions from the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI) and the well-connected banker Robert Pferdmenges. 32 In 1958, the British steering committee members enlisted the help of party leaders MacMillan, Grimond, and Gaitskell (who served on the committee anyway) to write a fundraising letter to British business circles for that year’s conference in Buxton. Unilever, I.C.I. and other firms each contributed £500. 33 The overall costs for running Bilderberg were limited. For the years 1961 and 1962, the annual costs amounted to around 105,000 Dutch guilders (around $30,000 in 1961), which covered the Bilderberg secretariat in The Hague, printing, and conference costs. 34 Still, it was a constant struggle to collect all the national contributions. As a result, steering committee"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Organization and membership 93 me mbership tended towards the type of wealthy businessmen and bankers such as Agnelli, Bennett, Baumgartner, Duncan, Griffin, and Wallenberg (“whose name opens all doors in Sweden,” as Lamping noted in 1962), who could arrange for annual payments. 35 In the United States, the situation was somewhat different. In 1955, the Ford Foundation agreed to give substantial financial support to the Bi lderberg Group. As Shepard Stone, head of the Foundation’s Interna - tional Af fairs division, wrote: “It is believed that the Foundation should not shun a serious conference of such a broad group of distinguished persons in their studied and dynamic efforts toward a meeting of minds in the Atlantic C om mu n it y.” 36 A first grant of $25,000 was approved for 1956; subsequent grants in 1959, 1963, 1966, and 1968 totaled over $200,000. 37 In 1957 and 1958, the Rockefeller Foundation also contributed two smaller grants of $5,000 and $10,000. The H. J. Heinz Family Trust and wealthy Bilderbergers such as Arthur Dean and George McGhee gave similar amounts. 38 Membership and participation In the first 15 years of its existence, almost 600 participants took part in the Bilderberg meetings (I will reserve the term Bilderberg ‘members’ for those who took part in more than one conference). About 25% of the participants came from the United States, 14% from the United Kingdom, and 9% each from France and the Federal Republic of Germany, followed by Canada and the Netherlands with 8% each. The Scandinavian countries together made up another 8%, Italy 6%, Belgium 4%, and other countries such as Switzerland, Turkey, Greece, and Austria a combined 10%. 39 Businessmen, bankers, and lawyers formed the largest group of Bi lderberg participants with over 30% of the total. Politicians and trade unionists ac - counted for over 20% of participants, diplomats and other government of - ficials for another 16%. Thirteen percent of the participants were academic experts, think tankers, intellectuals, and journalists. International organi - zations and institutions formed another important category. High-ranking officials from NATO, the World Bank, OECD, and IMF frequently par - ticipated, as did officials from the European C ommunities. Women were glaringly absent at the Bilderberg meetings. Princess Beatrix, Bernhard’s oldest daughter, was the first woman to participate in 1962, and for many years remained the only one – in part because Prince Bernhard apparently resisted female participation. It wasn’t until the early 1970s that this slowly began to change. 40 From the start, the Bilderberg organizers did attempt to create a balanced group of participants in terms of different political parties (governing as well as opposition parties), business, finance, labor unions, and civil society representatives. Overall, the organizers were successful, with the partial ex - ception of labor unions, whose leaders were oftentimes reluctant to partici - pate. 41 By the breadth of its membership, the Bilderberg Group contributed"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"94 Organization and membership t o the opening up of foreign policy elites on both sides of the Atlantic. Al though many Bilderberg members undoubtedly belonged to traditional elite groups based on class or societal rank, this was by no means the case for all. It would be misleading, therefore, to describe the transatlantic elite as a capitalist ‘power elite’ in the sense of C. Wright Mills and others. The pluralistic, nonpartisan nature of the Bilderberg Group ensured that different attitudes and policy preferences were heard and debated. As the Dutch trade unionist Henk Oosterhuis told Omer Becu, the president of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, the Bilderberg con - ferences “particularly can further the mutual understanding between the various groups of social life.” 42 The participation of leading German social democrats such as Carlo Schmid and Fritz Erler, moreover, contributed to the gradual acceptance of Germany’s Westbindung by the SPD. 43 The fact that important members of the British Labour Party as well as socialists from France, Scandinavia and elsewhere took an active part in Bilderberg helped to underpin the legitimacy of the Atlantic alliance. 44 Active partici - pation by left-of-center politicians and trade unionists also helped to coun - teract the impression that Bilderberg was purely a “rich men’s club.” 45 The Bilderberg organizers mainly relied on their private and official networks for the recruitment of participants. 46 To a considerable degree these networks were shaped during World War II and the immediate post - war period. The war effort by the allied powers had resulted in countless friendships and working relationships among policymakers, diplomats, sol - diers, businessmen, and intellectuals. Many of these relationships further deepened during the Marshall Plan, the creation of the Organisation for Eu ropean Economic Cooperation (OEEC), and the founding of NATO. On the US side, virtually all participants in the first Bilderberg meetings had been part of this Atlantic generation: they had either served in Europe dur - ing the war, or had earned their stripes as State Department, Marshall Plan, or NATO officials. 47 In the European context, the European Movement, the Council of Europe, and the OEEC had similarly created a web of linkages on which the Bilderberg organizers could rely. Although the Bilderberg meetings were secret, participants were en - couraged to share important insights and conclusions with relevant people in their respective countries. After each conference, a general report was sent to participants with an anonymous summary of the discussions. “Our Group,” Retinger wrote in 1955, is composed of men of outstanding authority whose opinions command the respect of large sections of the population of their various coun - tries. It is hoped therefore that, while duly safeguarding the provenance of the views expressed in the accompanying document, recipients who agree with these views will not fail to use the opportunities which they may have to transmit them to public opinion within their own special spheres of influence. 48"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Organization and membership 95 De pending on the topics on the agenda, the Bilderberg organizers asked a number of European and American experts to prepare brief reports for each meeting. These reports were sent to participants in advance and the rappor - teurs started off the discussion on these topics. Of course, Bilderberg members had different reasons and motivations for participating. Most participants undoubtedly shared the basic Atlanticist, anti- co mmunist consensus underlying the meetings. But they also benefitted from access to people of influence in an informal, intimate setting over the course of several days. In the words of Charles Maier, “power and influence rest on webs of co-opted sociability. Elites recruit themselves, often through merit but also through friendship and family.” 49 The Bilderberg organizers frequently sent lists of participants to all Bilderberg members and tried “to encourage and facilitate contacts between [the Bilderberg participants],” as Prince Bernhard wrote to all Bilderbergers in 1960. Paul Rijkens noted in his memoirs that he knew from personal experience how “useful” such “follow-up” could be. 50 “For me personally,” Otto Wolff recalled, “Bilderberg was of the great - est importance. If the New York banker David Rockefeller said that he owed 70% of his important connections to Bilderberg, for me it was almost 10 0 % .” 51 When Kurt Birrenbach traveled to the United States in 1959 as a relatively inexperienced member of the Bundestag , many of his meetings were arranged by Wolff, who relied exclusively on his Bilderberg network to do so. 52 In later years, Birrenbach became a Bilderberg regular himself and frequently operated as an informal diplomat for the Adenauer and Erhard governments. It is hard to tell, to what extent Bilderbergers like Wolff and Rockefeller relied on such connections in their day-to-day business. There can be little doubt, however, that they contributed to the increasing economic interde - pendence in the Euro-Atlantic area. When Finance Minister Antoine Pinay traveled to the United States in 1959, he asked Retinger for help in setting up informal meetings with “leading financiers and business men so that he could discuss with them the financial and economic recovery of France.” As Retinger told Rockefeller and Gabriel Hauge, “[Pinay] will, of course, be received officially, but such private talks would be of great help to him.” 53 Rockefeller himself kept close track of all the people he met in an “elec - tronically operated rolodex,” eventually collecting more than a hundred thousand entries. 54 He tapped into his Bilderberg network to recruit mem - bers for the Chase Bank’s International Advisory Committee (IAC). “John Loudon,” Rockefeller remembered, the distinguished chairman of Royal Dutch Petroleum agreed to take on the critical job of IAC chairman. John’s executive capabilities and diplomatic and managerial skills had brought him recognition as per - haps the world’s most prominent and respected businessman. I had met him at Bilderberg and other international gatherings over the years and come to like and admire him greatly. 55"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"96 Organization and membership T he two other European members Rockefeller mentions in his memoirs, Gi anni Agnelli and Wilfrid Baumgartner, were also Bilderberg steering committee members. Ernst van der Beugel was another example of a prominent Bilderberger becoming increasingly transnationally connected, through a series of di - rectorships at Warburg Bank, Xerox, General Electric, and Petrofina as well as his chairmanship of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Van der Beugel himself later acknowledged that his Bilderberg connections played an important role in getting these (often lucrative) positions. 56 Journalists mainly benefitted from the Bilderberg meetings in terms of information and contacts. Even though they were not supposed to write openly about the Bilderberg discussions, they could use the meetings as any other off-the-record source and they received access to the full list of Bi lderberg members. Cyrus Sulzberger, for example, based several of his columns on Bilderberg meetings in the late 1950s and asked Arthur Dean for an invitation in 1966 after not having been invited for several years. 57 The American journalist Joseph Harsch, on the other hand, wasn’t overly impressed with the Bilderberg meeting in 1958. As he told a colleague, I can’t say that I learned anything of great value to current broadcast - ing. On the contrary, I came away with a feeling that we journalists are as well informed, and at least as wise, as the supposedly great and near great. Perhaps that is why the great statesmen keep as far away from us as possible. “Its principal value,” he added, “was an opportunity to make the acquaint - ance of some people of some importance. It may pay off ultimately.” 58 In the period until the late 1960s, the number of journalists participating remained limited. The only journalist serving on the steering committee was Terkel Terkelsen. It was only in later years that journalists from the Ec onomist , the Financial Times , Die Zeit , the Wall Street Journal , and the Washington Post became regular participants, as continues to be the case today. Politicians and diplomats also had an interest in being present, not just to stay informed but also in order to influence leading members of the transatlantic elite. When David Ormsby-Gore (later Lord Harlech) became Pa rliamentary Under Secretary of State in 1956, he was, as Retinger told Bernhard, “very keen on our Group – in fact, he telephoned me a few days ago asking whether he would be invited in place of John Hope.” 59 Prime Minister Ha rold MacMillan asked his Lord Chancellor Lord Kilmuir to participate in the Bilderberg conference in the United States in the aftermath of the Suez Crisis. 60 And several decades later, Prime Minister Ma rgaret Thatcher told Michael Heseltine, As you know, the Conference has an extremely distinguished mem - bership and on the occasions which I have attended I have found its"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Organization and membership 97 di scussions of enormous value. If it is at all possible, therefore, I hope that you will feel able to accept the invitation; it will provide both a pres - tigious platform and a rare opportunity to influence world opinion. 61 During his time as Chancellor, Helmut Schmidt personally encouraged cabinet members to attend. He told his Finance Minister Hans Apel in 1977 that the Bilderberg conferences were “very useful, particularly be - cause they take place far away from official governmental meetings, and everyone can speak as openly as they want.” 62 Several years ear - lier, when Schmidt had to cancel his Bilderberg participation because of an election campaign, he told the party leadership that Karl Mommer would have to take his place. “It is absolutely necessary,” he wrote, “that social- de mocrats will be well- re presented at this important international conference.” 63 Not surprisingly, a considerable number of active, former, or future cabinet members, ministers, presidents, and prime ministers attended the Bi lderberg meetings. The list for the 1950s and 1960s included Dean Acheson, Ludwig Erhard, Tage Erlander, Gerald Ford, Walter Hallstein, Edward Heath, Christian Herter, Ole Bjørn Kraft, Kurt Georg Kiesinger, Joseph Luns, Jens Otto Krag, Guy Mollet, Olof Palme, Lester Pearson, Antoine Pinay, George Pompidou, Dean Rusk, Helmut Schmidt, Henri Simonet, Paul-Henri Spaak, Franz Josef Strauß, Pierre Trudeau, Paul van Zeeland, and Jelle Zijlstra. When the Kennedy Administration took office, active and former Bilderberg members George Ball, McGeorge Bundy, George McGhee, Paul Nitze, and Dean Rusk received prominent positions in the State Department and the Pentagon. High-ranking officials from international organizations such as NATO, the IMF, the World Bank, the OECD, and the European Commission likewise had an interest in participating. NATO Secretary-Generals Lord Is may, Paul-Henri Spaak, Dirk Stikker, Manlio Brosio, and Joseph Luns all participated in the Bilderberg meetings. As a reflection of how smaller nations could benefit from active participation in the informal alliance, three Dutch Bilderbergers all served in important international functions at the same time in the 1970s: Joseph Luns as NATO secretary-general, Sicco Mansholt as president of the European Commission, and Emile van Lennep as secretary-general of the OECD. 64 The fact that up-and-coming politicians such as Bill Clinton and Tony Blair were Bilderberg participants before reaching high office has led to sus - picions that they had been ‘groomed’ by the Bilderberg Group. The sim - pler explanation, however, is that for politicians such as these, participation bolstered their foreign policy experience and increased their status. 65 They advanced their own careers by going to the Bilderberg meetings, rather than the other way around. 66 The Bilderberg organizers, meanwhile, were al - ways on the lookout for new talent to become part of the transatlantic elite through socialization at the Bilderberg meetings."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"98 Organization and membership T he Bilderberg organizers themselves were somewhat ambivalent about active prime ministers or cabinet members participating. On the one hand, their participation reinforced Bilderberg’s reputation for attracting high- level participants and meant that the discussions directly reached policy - makers. On the other hand, the Bilderberg steering committee wished to prevent the impression that the conferences had turned into a semiofficial meeting place for government representatives, where frank and open discus - sions were no longer possible. 67 Despite the long list of influential Bilderberg participants, it should also be noted that there were limits to the reach of Bilderberg. After all, the meet - ings mainly attracted those who subscribed to the underlying internation - alist consensus. Radical critics of this consensus on the left and right were unlikely to be invited, and, if they were, unlikely to be persuaded by the experience. In terms of elite socialization, the Bilderberg Group was most likely to have an impact on ‘future leaders’ who were more aligned with the political mainstream. By the late 1960s, however, the Bilderberg organizers worried that – partly as a result of the Vietnam protest movements – the pool of younger talent was drying up and embarked upon an active strategy of rejuvenating the Bilderberg Group. 68 Foreign policy experts: the case of Kissinger and Brzezinski Some of the talents recruited by the Bilderberg organizers were foreign policy experts, who could benefit from participation in transnational net - works with a boost in reputation, authority, and status. 69 Two prominent examples closely connected to the Bilderberg Group were Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski. Both men were ambitious foreign policy intellec - tuals with a similar background as immigrants and with a similar talent for self-promotion. Both used their domestic and international networks to build a reputation as leading foreign policy experts, a reputation that ulti - mately helped pave their way into the White House. 70 Kissinger first drew the attention of the Bilderberg organizers while run - ning a Council on Foreign Relations study on nuclear strategy. His result - ing book Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy became a surprise bestseller and was read at the highest levels in Washington D.C. and other NATO capitals. David Rockefeller served on the same study group and probably arranged Kissinger’s invitations to the two Bilderberg conferences in 1957 and again in 1964. From 1971 onwards, Kissinger participated in virtually all the Bi lderberg meetings, and after the end of the Ford Administration he joined the steering committee. Using the contacts established at Bilderberg and at his own Harvard In ternational Seminar, Kissinger started a habit of frequent trips to Eur ope to meet with members of the local foreign policy elites. 71 In the Federal Re public of Germany, the scope of his networks was particularly impres sive and included leading politicians as well as journalists such as Die Zeit ’s"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Organization and membership 99 Ma rion Gräfin Dönhoff and Theo Sommer (participant in the 1960 Ha rvard International Seminar), Der Spiegel ’s Rudolf Augstein, and Die Süddeutsche ’s Günter Gaus (another International Seminar participant). 72 Having met Fritz Erler, Carlo Schmid, and Kurt Georg Kiesinger at the 1957 Bilderberg conferences, Kissinger made sure to stay in touch with them by sending publications such as his Foreign Affairs article “Missiles and the Western Alliance.” 73 In 1959, Carlo Schmid returned the favor by arranging an extended visit to Germany under the auspices of the Auswärtige Amt . Kissinger’s schedule included meetings with Chancellor Adenauer, Foreign Minister Heinrich von Brentano, Defense Minister Franz Josef Strauß, Berlin Mayor Willy Brandt, and an impressive number of journalists and academics. 74 Kissinger also became a frequent participant in the biannual German-American conferences first organized in 1959 by the American Council on Germany and the Atlantik-Brücke . 75 Kissinger’s first foray into actual policy-making, as a consultant in the Ke nnedy Administration, turned into a major disappointment. He wrote a number of policy and background papers on Berlin and the Ge rman Qu estion, but, in part due to his testy relationship with National Se curity Ad visor McGeorge Bundy, his contract ended prematurely in 1962. Ne vertheless, Kissinger remained active as a foreign policy advisor to Ne lson Rockefeller and frequently published articles in journals such as Foreign Affairs and The Reporter . He also made sure that the memoranda on his travels through Europe and Asia continued to reach policymakers in the White House and the State Department. When President-elect Nixon asked Kissinger to become his national se - curity advisor after the 1968 election, the latter’s international reputation and network must have been an important factor. Once in the White House, moreover, Kissinger’s network gave him access to information and people in a way that enabled him to be his own little State Department and to engage in the kind of back-channel diplomacy that he and the President delighted in. Kissinger, for example, used the 1971 Woodstock Bilderberg conference to negotiate the parameters of Ostpolitik with Chancellor Brandt’s foreign af - fairs advisor Egon Bahr. 76 In the 1980s, when Kissinger and Brent Scowcroft founded the international consulting firm Kissinger Associates, Kissinger relied on his Bilderberg network to enlist leading European Bilderbergers such as Sir Peter Carrington, Sir Eric Roll, and Étienne Da vignon as inter - national directors. 77 He also continued to use the Bilderberg conferences themselves to arrange private meetings with other members of the transat - lantic foreign policy elite such as Chancellor Helmut Schmidt. 78 One of the closest friendships resulting from Kissinger’s international travels was with the Dutch Deputy Foreign Minister Ernst van der Be ugel. The two met in the Netherlands in 1957, shared similar backgrounds, and quickly became friends. Van der Beugel introduced Kissinger to the Dutch foreign policy elite and frequently organized private dinners for him in The Hague. Kissinger, meanwhile, arranged for Van der Beugel to spend time"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"100 Organization and membership a t Harvard and helped him publish his study of US postwar European pol - icies. 79 As Albertine Bloemendal has shown, Van der Beugel did not hes - itate to enlist the help of his friend in informal diplomacy once Kissinger had become national security advisor. 80 One prominent case involved the controversial negotiations about KLM landing rights in the United States. In addition, Van der Beugel kept Kissinger informed about the Bilderberg conferences and about Dutch policymakers, advising him how to deal with Prime Minister Barend Biesheuvel and Foreign Minister Norbert Schmelzer. 81 Brzezinski’s road to the White House was similar to Kissinger’s, with sta - tions at Harvard’s Russian Research Center and Columbia Un iversity, partic - ipation in Council on Foreign Relations study groups and Ger man-American conferences, a stint at the State Department’s policy planning staff, and a role as advisor to Democratic presidential candidates. In 1966, Brzezinski participated in his first Bilderberg conference, and it was during a flight to the 1972 Bilderberg conference that he first discussed the creation of the Tri - lateral Commission with David Rockefeller. Brzezinski and Rockefeller were both in favor of including Japan in the formal and informal counsels of the West, and Rockefeller had attempted to convince the Bilderberg steering committee to open up Bilderberg to Japanese participation. After the steer - ing committee again refused to do so in 1972, Rockefeller set out to create a new informal organization similar to the Bilderberg Group – although more directly aimed at influencing government policies – and asked Brzezinski to help establish the Trilateral Commission. 82 Not surprisingly, Rockefeller and Brzezinski relied on their Bilderberg network to recruit European and Am erican members for the Trilateral Commission. When the little-known Governor of Georgia, James Earl Carter, became an early member of the Trilateral Commission, Brzezinski agreed to be - come his foreign policy mentor. As a result, Brzezinski became foreign pol - icy advisor to Carter’s long-shot presidential campaign in 1976. After his surprise victory, Carter named Brzezinski his national security advisor and relied on the Trilateral Commission to fill many of the top foreign-policy positions in his administration. Transnational networks such as Bilderberg and the Trilateral Commis - sion, as these examples show, helped to create opportunities for relative out - siders to become part of the foreign policy establishment. They stimulated closer links between academia, think tanks, foundations, business, politics, and government, and they enabled foreign policy experts to become inter - nationally connected and recognized authorities. In the case of Kissinger and Brzezinski, this trajectory led to high-level policy-making functions in the White House and the State Department. The fact that Kissinger and Brzezinski were members of the transatlantic elite, it should be noted, by no means guaranteed smooth sailing in transatlantic relations while they were in office. Both men faced serious troubles with their European partners during the 1970s."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Organization and membership 101 I n Europe, foreign policy-making remained largely the responsibility of politicians and career diplomats. Yet these politicians and officials could benefit from the Bilderberg network in similar ways. In addition, Bilderberg and other transatlantic networks provided special opportunities for politi - cians of opposition parties to stay informed about important developments on both sides of the Atlantic. As Helmut Schmidt put it in his memoirs: One didn’t have to travel to the United States every year, as long as one participated in some of the private international conferences; I remem - ber the yearly so-called Bilderberg conferences with gratitude [...] Thus, the United States was relatively transparent to European politicians. 83 Based on their transnational access to information and people of influence, European Bilderberg members established or strengthened their reputa - tions as foreign policy experts, frequently publishing books, articles, and speeches on issues such as nuclear strategy, NATO, and European integra - tion. In Germany, Fritz Erler, Helmut Schmidt, and Kurt Birrenbach were prominent examples. In the United Kingdom, Healey and Gaitskell were immensely productive authors and speakers on foreign policy. Ernst van der Beugel played a similar role in the Netherlands and also educated future gen - erations of foreign policy professionals as a professor at Leiden Un iversity. Other Bilderberg members who can be regarded as leading voices on in - ternational affairs in Europe included Raymond Aron in France, Pietro Qu aroni in Italy, and Alastair Buchan in the United Kingdom. 84 Bilderberg atmospherics The importance of the atmospherics and private interactions at Bilderberg is apparent in much of the private correspondence about the meetings. “The reception of the German participants,” Otto Wolff wrote about the 1955 meeting in Barbizon, was very friendly from all sides, but particularly from the American side; the overall atmosphere was that of an old group of friends. Lunch and dinner took place without a specific seating arrangement, allow - ing for interesting private conversations beyond the official agenda. In Ba rbizon, there was none of the initial reserve, as is usually the case during such meetings. 85 Louis Camu likewise wrote about the Barbizon conference: This exploration of the situation of the Western world, of its material and moral power, took place during forty hours of discussion, with a sincerity, a straightforwardness, and a high-mindedness [“hauteur de vues”] that are rare in international meetings, public or private. Neither"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"102 Organization and membership a t Strasbourg, nor at the European Movement or the United Nations, do such objectivity, goodwill and intelligence come together. In addi - tion, the personal contacts established during the meetings are valuable and may be useful in consolidating precarious positions or in speeding up US activities in favor of Western Europe. 86 After returning from the 1957 conference in Fiuggi, Italy, the Ford Founda - tion’s Shepard Stone reported that the informal discussions over dinner or a drink were as important as the formal sessions, if not more. 87 Looking back at his years organizing the Bilderberg conferences, Ernst van der Beugel likewise argued that at least 50% of the importance of the Bilderberg meet - ings revolved around what occurred outside of the meeting rooms. 88 These informal discussions stimulated the kind of transatlantic gossip that allowed Bilderberg participants to play their role as members of the foreign policy elite. 89 As the Canadian Ambassador in Rome, Pierre Dupuy, wrote about the Bilderberg conference in Fiuggi: The contacts which took place outside the Conference Room were no less useful. In fact, certain impressions could be more easily exchanged in private conversation. For instance, regarding President Eisenhower’s state of health I heard it said repeatedly, by people who had seen him in the last few months, that he was no longer the man he used to be and could not be counted upon to make vital decisions. It was suggested that this might account for the bolder policy followed by the Soviets at the present time. 90 The clubby atmosphere at the Bilderberg meetings also contributed to a cer - tain sense of kinship and community. “Experience has taught me,” as Denis Healey put it in his memoirs, that lack of understanding is the main cause of all evil in public affairs – as in private life. Nothing is more likely to produce understanding than the sort of personal contacts which involves people not just as officials or representatives, but also as human beings. 91 And as a report for the Ford Foundation put it: The intimate atmosphere of the Conference, the frequency of the meet - ings, all of which were plenary, with no division into committees, cre - ated an environment of mutual trust and friendship. Thus, when it came to dealing with controversial subjects, more was accomplished than had been expected. 92 Johannes Großmann has shown a similar effect for Europe’s conserv - ative transnational organizations during the Cold War, which resulted"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Organization and membership 103 i n numerous friendships, a sense of community, and a shared European “ Selbstverständnis .” 93 An anecdote from the 1962 Bilderberg meeting in Saltsjöbaden illustrates the school trip-like atmosphere that could develop. One of the participants had mentioned a fable-like James Reston column in the New York Times in which different animals represented various statesmen or countries: President De Gaulle was a giraffe, Chancellor Adenauer an old fox, Prime Minister Macmillan a lion, and the United States a buffalo. The morale of Reston’s story was that if the giraffe and the fox kept the lion out of the forest, this might anger the buffalo that was responsible for defending the forest. Once the buffalo was gone and the old giraffe had died, the foxes took over. The bear in the East did not like this. Together with the tiger (China), the bear thereupon ate all the foxes and the giraffes. It was a rather crude story – the giraffe was proud, “and taller than the Washington Monu - ment, and he thought he could see farther than all the other animals” – but it was a hit at the Saltsjöbaden conference. As C. D. Jackson told the story to Re ston, the conference secretariat made copies for all participants, caus - ing the French participants – Wilfrid Baumgartner and Pierre Dreyfus – to protest “against this insult to their Chief of State” (the giraffe died of “a terrible sore throat”). “However,” Jackson wrote, “from that moment on, all the representatives referred to international personages by animal name rather than surname.” 94 The venues of the conferences further stimulated close personal contacts and socialization. 95 They were chosen for their relative seclusion to ensure that participants would remain together for the whole time of the confer - ence. If the original Hotel de Bilderberg had been relatively simple, many of the subsequent hotels were more exquisite, from the Hotel Alpenhof in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, to the Palace Hotel near Luzern (“where we will have Audrey Hepburn and Sophia Loren as neighbors in their villas,” as one Bilderberg organizer noted), the Grand Hotel Saltsjöbaden in Sweden and the majestic Villa d’Este at Lake Como. 96 An exception was the 1967 con - ference in Cambridge, where participants had to stay in the rather simpler student accommodations of St. Johns College. Adding to the allure of Bilderberg, participants such as Jack Heinz and Standard Oil’s Emilio Collado sometimes made their private or company planes available for transportation, taking along cases of wine or liquor if ne c e s s a r y. 97 As Heinz told Prince Bernhard in preparation for the 1957 con - ference at the King and Prince Hotel on St. Simons Island: “The facilities for a conference are excellent. The food, I judge, is simple but good Southern cooking, with plenty of good, clean drinkin’ whiskey (and I will play deux - ieme sommelier when it comes to the vintage stuff).” 98 Mindful of Retinger’s love of good food, Prince Bernhard warned him before the Bilderberg con - ference in Barbizon that “we certainly should not have lunches of 6 courses etc. In fact I insist, repeat insist, that all luncheons are light, otherwise the afternoon will be a sleeping session!” 99"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"104 Organization and membership Th e atmospherics of the Bilderberg conferences must have encouraged new participants to fit in in order to be accepted as member of the group. As Ian Richardson has argued, “the selection of participants and the subtle expectations of membership incline [elite] networks towards a broad con- sensual understanding.” 100 The fact that only steering committee members were certain of being invited to the Bilderberg conferences will have induced participants who wished to be invited again to conform to the habitus and core beliefs of the Bilderberg organizers. The resulting socialization process and identification with the transnational foreign policy elite implied a will - ingness to engage in constructive dialogue, thus developing what might be called transnational empathy. 101 The Bilderberg Group’s influence The central paradox of the Bilderberg Group was that the conferences were so useful to foreign policy elites precisely because of their private nature and the fact that no decisions were made. The Bilderberg meetings provided an informal diplomatic forum for the kind of candid conversations that were rare at official gatherings. Combined with the prominence of many Bilderberg participants, the meetings allowed participants not only to stay informed about important developments, but also, in the words of Margaret Thatcher, to “influence world opinion.” Widespread suspicions that the Bilderberg Group was – or wanted to be – some sort of secret world government thus miss the point of the meetings. They provided no decision-making apparatus, but rather a space for partic - ipants to influence each other. The Bilderberg Group itself had no influence or agency beyond setting the agenda for the meetings, inviting participants, and the resulting socialization effects. The real importance of the Bilderberg meetings was determined by what the participants did with the information and ideas they encountered, with the contacts they established, and with, to use Bourdieu’s term, the symbolic capital they assembled. 102 As a result, the Bilderberg meetings revolved around informal diplomacy: the kind of indi - rect influence that relied on introducing new ideas, shaping transnational debates, nurturing understanding for different attitudes and perceptions, assessing the authority and reputation of other participants, creating a sense of community based on certain shared values and norms, and bringing peo - ple with diverse backgrounds and political leanings together in an environ - ment favorable to frank exchanges. 103 “Influence often works most effectively,” as Carl J. Friedrich has put it, “by creating a certain ambience for decisions through its effect on attitudes, beliefs and values unrelated to immediate decisions.” 104 Joseph S. Nye’s concept of soft power – the power of attraction – relies on an analogous un - derstanding of influence. 105 Soft power can make hard power acceptable or legitimate by giving it a shared moral purpose. Conversely, the illegitimate"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Organization and membership 105 u se of hard power (or the perception thereof) can cause a decline in soft power. In the context of the Atlantic alliance, Christopher Hemmer and Peter Katzenstein have similarly argued that collective identification with the politically constructed North Atlantic region is an important part of the explanation why the United States was willing to participate in the highly integrated multilateralism of NATO in Europe, but not in Asia. 106 Such collective identities, however, are never stable and depend on con - stant reinforcement and renegotiation. In view of the changing power dy - namics of the transatlantic relationship and the many crises facing NATO in its first decades, this was especially true for the Atlantic alliance. In this constant process of shaping and adjusting collective identities, the Bi lderberg meetings could serve as a space for consensus building and crisis management. The first Bilderberg conference, after all, had shown that the meetings could cultivate a strong sense of emotional community based on conceptions of the Free World or the West. In terms of alliance politics, simply showing up could already have an effect. This was true in particular for leading US participants who, by en - gaging in informal discussions and by showing an interest in their European partners – in short, by mutual responsiveness, could stimulate acceptance of the United States’ leadership role within NATO. As Dean Rusk told Paul Nitze in 1955: “I know that our European colleagues appreciated the inter - est shown by the American side.” 107 John Lewis Gaddis has argued that “the habits of domestic democratic politics” helped the Americans in managing the alliance: “Negotiation, compromise, and consensus-building abroad came naturally to statesmen steeped in the uses of such practices at home.” 108 Martin Shaw has similarly drawn attention to the more or less consensual partnership of states and societies in which nearly all gained in security and wealth. The West offered a model of internationalization that was not forced, and, despite manifest inequal - ities, offered real benefits to allies and friends. 109 The informal alliance was an important part of this Western model and offered not just American or European leaders a chance to engage in in - formal diplomacy, but also representatives from international institutions. NATO officials were particularly attuned to the potential importance of the Bi lderberg meetings. As General Gruenther told the participants in the 1955 Bilderberg meeting at Garmisch: “I should like to hope that you Gentlemen here would constitute yourselves as a type of general staff that would help develop public opinion.” 110 Following the example of General Gruenther and NATO Se cret ar y- Ge neral Lord Ismay, a long list of high-ranking NATO offi - cials, including Secretary-Generals Spaak, Stikker, and Brosio, participated in multiple Bilderberg conferences – a practice that has continued to this day."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"106 Organization and membership M eanwhile, the Bilderberg organizers themselves recognized that Bi lderberg’s influence was difficult to measure. “Given the informal nature of the Bilderberg Meetings,” the American steering committee members re - ported to the Ford Foundation, it is almost impossible to cite specific achievements resulting from the conferences. [...] Nevertheless, considering the influential positions held by so many of the participants, it seems likely that the views expressed during the discussions are conveyed to government officials, and may thus have an indirect, but nonetheless significant, impact on policies. One indication of the value placed on these informal exchanges is the continued high caliber of the participants. 111 An internal report by the Rockefeller Foundation likewise concluded: There have been five meetings of the Bilderberg Group to date, and all the evidence points to the conclusion that these meetings have done much to promote international understanding among key persons to their considerable mutual benefit. A wider comprehension by persons in high places – as through the Bilderberg Group – promotes international understanding and relieves international tension in a way that research cannot touch. 112 George Ball described the importance of his Bilderberg connections in sim - ilar terms: “When I joined the State Department in 1961, I was already well acquainted with most Western leaders. [...] I was sensitive to their attitudes and prejudices, while they understood America much better because of ex - posure to articulate Americans.” 113 If the Bilderberg meetings could serve as a sort of barometer of trans - atlantic relations, many participants shared their impressions of the dis - cussions with government officials and others. As we have seen, several American participants sent reports of the first Bilderberg meetings to the State Department and the CIA. Although the evidence is fragmentary, we can assume that they continued to do so. Joseph Johnson, for example, sent a summary of the April 1958 extended steering committee meeting to Allen Dulles at the CIA, and Gabriel Hauge wrote brief reports on the Bilderberg meetings for President Eisenhower. 114 Prince Bernhard, as we have seen, kept the Dutch foreign ministry in - formed and similar reports show up in official German, Danish, and Bri tish archives. In 1963, George Ball even reported on that year’s Bilderberg con - ference to the National Security Council. One year later, Ernst van der Be ugel spent several weeks in the United States and told Prince Bernhard: “My general impression is that the work of the Bilderberg is considered of the highest importance in this country not only among the Bilderbergers themselves but also very much at the top level in Washington.” 115"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Organization and membership 107 The informal alliance As the story of Bilderberg’s founding exemplifies, the Bilderberg Group was part of a wider process of transnational elite formation during and after World War II. In terms of official institutions, as Geir Lundestad has put it, “the many meetings in the various Atlantic organizations and the establish - ment of permanent bureaucratic structures for these organizations had to encourage the creation of transnational elites.” This development, in Lun - destad’s view, “far from ended conflicts among the participating nations, but it must have made the chances of resolving conflicts somewhat greater.” 116 In terms of private or public-private organizations, Bilderberg was part of a strong movement towards informal transnational interchanges and net - works, a movement that reflected the global mindset and internationalism of the emerging transatlantic elite. Membership in these networks overlapped, creating a dense web of transnational relationships and linkages: an informal alliance. 117 Many Bi lderberg participants, for example, were active in other transnational net - works and were members of foreign policy think tanks and institutes such as the Council on Foreign Relations, Chatham House, the Centre d’Études de Politique Étrangère , the Instituto per gli Studi di Politica Internazionale , or the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Auswärtige Politik . 118 The foundation of the Institute for Strategic Studies in London in 1958 was even to some extent a direct result of the Bilderberg meetings. The In stitute was co-founded by, among others, Denis Healey and Rear- Adm iral Sir An thony Buzzard, both strong critics of the Eisenhower Ad ministration’s strategy of massive retaliation. They had been present at the 1955 Bi lderberg conference in Garmisch and used their Bilderberg connections to organ - ize a conference on nuclear strategy in Brighton in early 1957. Later that year Healey approached the Ford Foundation’s Shepard Stone at the Fiu ggi Bi lderberg conference and eventually secured a grant of $150,000 to set up the Institute. Alistair Buchan, the Institute’s first director, recalled that “without Denis and his contacts we might never have got the money, and the I.S.S. might never have been born.” 119 Other foreign policy institutes founded in the same period included the Foreign Policy Research Institute (founded in 1955 at the University of Pe nnsylvania by Robert Strausz-Hupé), the Washington Center of Foreign Policy Research at the John Hopkins University’s School of Advanced Stra - tegic Studies (founded by Paul Nitze in 1957 and later turned into the Foreign Policy Institute), and Harvard’s Center for International Affairs. 120 In an ef - fort to combat anti-Americanism and to promote Atlantic cooperation and Eu ropean integration, the Ford Foundation and other American foundations also funded dozens of American and European Studies institutes at European universities, as well as academic conferences such as the Salzburg Seminar. 121 As air travel became faster and more accessible in the second half of the 1950s, frequent trips and speaking tours across the Atlantic suddenly became"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"108 Organization and membership f easible. The US government and US foundations were particularly active in organizing and financing visits to the United States. 122 US policymakers and politicians, moreover, were remarkably accessible to Eu ropean members of the foreign policy elite. Meetings at the White House, State Dep artment, Pentagon, and Congress became coveted features for Eu ropean politicians, diplomats, and foreign policy experts traveling to the United States. Such visits were by no means limited to those Europeans in positions of power. 123 Oppositional politicians such as the SPD’s Fritz Erler or Labour’s Hugh Gaitskell could count on being taken seriously in Washington. Given the frequent bureaucratic and political battles over most aspects of US foreign policy, access to top decision-makers and members of Congress could open up avenues of real influence. The correspondence in the private archives of many Bilderberg members shows that being part of the transatlantic elite also meant keeping abreast of widely read publications such as Foreign Affairs , Orbis , Encounter , the International Herald Tribune , The Reporter , or Survival – thus indicating the existence of a transatlantic public sphere. 124 The Bilderberg organizers regularly sent copies of important articles or speeches to Bilderberg mem - bers and distributed overviews of research on the Atlantic Community and European integration compiled by the Carnegie Endowment and the Ford Foundation. 125 Several prominent Bilderbergers, including Prince Bernhard and Paul Rijkens, were also involved in the attempt to create a truly trans - atlantic review called Western World . They launched the first issue in the spring of 1957 with a declaration on the Atlantic Community signed by a large number of Bilderbergers. 126 Western World managed to attract influ - ential contributors, yet not sufficient subscribers to become economically viable, leading to its termination after just two years. At the transatlantic level, the Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF), founded in 1950 to bring together leading intellectuals and politicians (in - cluding Bilderberg members such as Aron, Brauer, Healey, Gaitskell, de Rougemont, and Stone), was an important early part of the informal alli - ance. 127 Other groups focused on different forms of Atlantic unity, includ - ing Clarence Streit’s federalist Atlantic Union Committee, the Declaration of Atlantic Unity of October 1954, and the Paris-based Atlantic Treaty Org anization, founded in 1955. The NATO Parliamentarians’ Conference, which first met in 1955, became part of the informal alliance because of the reluctance on the part of Great Britain and other member states to create an official consultative assembly along the lines of the Council of Europe. Finn Moe, chair of the Norwegian Parliament’s foreign affairs committee and an early Bilderberg member, was one of its founders and Denis Healey a participant from the start. 128 One of the initiatives of the NATO Parliamentarians was the 1959 At lantic Congress in London, which brought together over 600 delegates from NATO countries and resulted in a call to include the United States and Canada in the OEEC and to create an Atlantic Institute. 129 Prince Bernhard chaired"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Organization and membership 109 t he Atlantic Congress’s special plenary session, which featured fellow Bi lderbergers Halvard Lange, Hugh Gaitskell, and NATO Secretary- Ge neral Paul-Henri Spaak. After the 1959 Atlantic Congress, the International Movement for At lantic Union, with Streit at its head, was formed and several prominent Bilderberg members, including Paul van Zeeland and Kurt Birrenbach, were involved in the creation of the Atlantic Institute in 1961. 130 The Atlantic Institute re - c eived generous funding from the Ford Foundation and acted as a clearing - house for information concerning the alliance, publishing frequent studies on Atlantic issues, as well as the Atlantic Community Quarterly . However, the Institute’s frequent leadership struggles limited its effectiveness. In late 1961, Secretary of State Dean Rusk and former secretaries of state Dean Acheson and Christian Herter encouraged a number of Atlanticist organizations in the United States, including the Atlantic Council, the America Committee for an Atlantic Institute, and the Citizens Commission on NATO, to con - solidate in the Atlantic Council of the United States (ACUS). 131 Christian Herter acted as the Council’s first chairman and was succeeded by General Lauris Norstad in 1963; General Gruenther and Henry J. Heinz served on its executive committee. In order to cement the Westbindung of the Federal Republic, the Am erican Council on Germany (ACG) and the Atlantik-Brücke started organizing the biannual German-American conferences, modeled after the Bilderberg conferences, in 1959. 132 Two years later, Ewald von Kleist organized the first Wehrkundetagung in Munich, bringing together US and European politi - cians and defense analysts specifically interested in strategic debates. The annual Königswinter conferences, first organized in the early 1950s, played an important role in the bilateral British-German relationship. 133 In Europe, the postwar transnational turn went beyond the EM and its associated organizations. A significant number of Christian democratic, conservative, and socialist political and business networks saw the light of day, including the Geneva Circle, the Nouvelles Équipes Internation - ales , the Centre Européen de Documentation et d’Information (CEDI), the Cercle Pinay , the European Committee for Social and Economic Progress (CEPES), the Institut d’Etudes Politiques and the European Roundtable of Industrialists. 134 In late 1954, Retinger, Denis de Rougemont, Prince Bernhard, Ri jkens, and other Bilderberg organizers set up the Fondation Européenne de la Cu lture , or European Cultural Foundation (ECF), in Geneva. Prince Be rnhard served as the Foundation’s president from 1955–1977. After initial struggles to finance the Foundation, he decided to organize a big European fund - raising conference in Amsterdam in 1957 on the theme of “Cultural and In tellectual Unity in Europe.” Like the Congress of Europe nine years earlier, the Am sterdam conference brought together a large number of prominent Europeans, including Spaak, Adenauer, Schuman, and Hendrik Brugmans, the first principal of the College of Europe in Bruges. The Foundation"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"110 Organization and membership a nnounced that it wished to emulate the success of the big American foun - dations and “to build up a strong European foundation, independent of po - litical and governmental control, which can devote itself specifically to the support of the important aspects of European culture.” 135 Further confer - ences followed, and the Foundation worked with the Council of Europe to promote the European idea through programs such as “Europe at School Day.” In 1960, the Fo undation moved to Amsterdam, and Prince Bernhard secured funding from the Dutch Lotteries through the Prince Bernhard Cu ltural Foundation. 136 Probably the most influential informal organization in Europe was the Action Committee for the United States of Europe, led by Jean Monnet and Max Kohnstamm, which engaged in more direct forms of informal governance than other organizations. 137 The Monnet Committee brought together leading European politicians and trade unionist leaders and regu - larly passed resolutions on European integration, which were brought up for votes in national parliaments. At the same time, Monnet and Kohnstamm frequently acted as informal diplomats in ways similar to Retinger’s efforts in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Like Retinger, they could rely on an im - pressive network of European and American high-level contacts and they did not hesitate to use it. Monnet was invited to several Bilderberg con - ferences, but declined to participate. Kohnstamm, however, became a fre - quent Bilderberg participant from 1961 onwards and was later involved in the founding of the Trilateral Commission. The dramatic expansion of private and public-private transnational or - ganizations after World War II marked an important change in the makeup and interconnectedness of foreign policy elites in North America and Eu rope. Similar organizations had, of course, existed before the war, but both the quantity and the quality in terms of influence and participation was different after 1945. 138 This was in part the result of improvements in communication and air travel, but it also reflected the global mindset of foreign policy elites on both sides of the Atlantic. Since the Bilderberg Group was one of the most prominent organiza- tions of the informal alliance, its meetings and the relationships between its members can tell us much about how the transatlantic elite defined common interests and values, how it perceived and tried to shape the key issues and challenges facing the Atlantic alliance, and how it dealt with the inevitable misunderstandings and conflicts of interest. And in the years after the first Bilderberg conference there certainly was no shortage of challenges and conflicts: the failure of the European Defense Community in August 1954 threw Europe into disarray; the Soviet Union’s new strat - egy of peaceful coexistence severely tested the West’s ability to adapt to the changing nature of the Cold War; and the whirlwind of decolonization continued to strain transatlantic relations, resulting in the Suez c risis in late 1956."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Organization and membership 111 Notes 1 Rockefeller to Prince Bernhard, June 3, 1954, Box 186, Bilderberg Archives, N ANL. 2 Se e the correspondence in Box 30, Bilderberg Archives, NANL.

Despite the fact that the EDC had been voted down by the French parliament, the French Socialist leader and Bilderberg cofounder Guy Mollet attempted to convince his fellow Bilderberg participants that the European idea was by no means dead. “Rest assured, friends abroad,” Mollet announced, the day you will confront us with the problem of European economic in tegration – transport, agriculture, atomic energy pool or general en - ergy pool – you will find 450 votes in the French parliament; they are there, they are guaranteed, they are certain. 1 Indeed, two years later, the ratification of the Rome Treaties, establish - ing Euratom and the European Economic Community, resurrected the Eu ropean project and created the framework for the later European Union. 2 Mollet, who was the Fourth Republic’s longest-serving prime minister (from February 1956 until May 1957), played a crucial role in the negoti - ations leading up to Rome, as did a number of other Bilderberg partici - pants, including Walter Hallstein and Robert Marjolin. 3 The Bilderberg discussions at Barbizon and at Garmisch-Partenkirchen (September 23–25, 1955) thus allow for unique insights into the evolving thinking of European and American foreign policy elites during the so-called relance européenne . What these insights tell us is that much of the historiography of European integration misses both the complexity and the interwoven nature of the po - litical, historical, social, and economic considerations and motives behind the treaties. As the discussions at the first Bilderberg Conference in 1954 already indicated, European integration was a response not just to Europe’s fateful history of violent nationalism, but also to the multiple challenges of the postwar world: the communist threat from the East and from within, the demise of Europe’s empires, the economic competition from the United States, the unsolved German question in a divided Europe, the advent of the nuclear age, and the fragility of Europe’s societies. 5 Integrating Europe"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"120 Integrating Europe R ecognizing the interlinkages between these different motives and rea - sons allows us to overcome the gap in the historiography between the two competing schools of thought personified by Walter Lipgens and Alan Mi lward. 4 Lipgens, one of the first historians to study European integra - tion, was mostly concerned with the sociocultural origins of Europe. He dealt more with ideas than with policies. He shared the conviction of many of his study objects that the nation-state had proven its inability to deal with the economic and political challenges of the modern age, thus giving way to new, supranational structures. Milward, in contrast, emphasized the continued importance of the state. His revisionist interpretation explained European integration first and foremost as an effort to stabilize and secure the economic and social foundations of the European nation-states through increased cooperation and trade. Based on the Bilderberg discussions of 1955, this chapter argues that both schools of thought are, in fact, fully compatible. The first part of the chapter shows that Europe’s instability and the fear of communist disruption within Western-European societies was a much more important driving force for a renewed attempt to create a united Europe than has been recognized in the lit - erature. 5 The second part highlights the continued importance of the Ger man question, even after the Federal Republic’s admission to NATO, while the third part explains the importance of the United States as the economic inspi - ration for the Common Market. Taken together, these different elements, com - bined with the geopolitical impact of the Suez crisis, explain why European integration, initially dominated by conservative Catholics such as Adenauer and Schuman, now benefitted from a much broader, cross-party coalition. Anti-communist Europe The idea that a united Europe could act as a bulwark against communism while binding Germany more closely to the West was nothing new. Nor was the idea of a European common market, which had been discussed and pro - posed by the European League for Economic Cooperation, the Council of Eu rope, the European Movement, the Organisation for European Ec onomic Cooperation, and policymakers such as the Dutch Foreign Minister Beyen. At the first Bilderberg conference, several participants had underlined the need for further European integration, and the final report had called for Europeans to “achieve a moral and material strength capable of meeting any threat to their freedom.” What was different in 1955, however, was the even greater sense of urgency infusing the Bilderberg discussions on E ur ope. This urgency was not only the result of the EDC’s dramatic failure; it was based to a considerable degree on the perception of an unrelenting commu - nist threat. Particularly in the French Fourth Republic – never a model of stability – the risk of a communist takeover seemed real. 6 The Bilderberg participants spent most of the Barbizon meeting grap - pling with “the uncommitted people” of the world and with the remarkable"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Integrating Europe 121 s uccess of communist ideology and propaganda in Europe and the Third World. European integration was not even officially part of the agenda, yet every time the discussion turned to the question how Western Europe could build a more effective political defense against the communist threat from within, a united Europe turned out to be part of the answer. Meanwhile, the language employed to make the case for Europe was strikingly similar to the rhetoric of emotional community that had permeated the discussions at the first Bilderberg conference. The French and Italian participants, in particular, emphasized that the threat of a communist takeover was far from imaginary. The strength of the Commu - nist party in both countries and the fact that the communists controlled many important trade unions led Guy Mollet to conclude that there was a real danger of a communist victory in the Cold War – not by military aggression but by internal subversion of Western societies. 7 Danish Minister of Foreign Affairs Kraft warned that there were indications that the Cominform was preparing “some sort of civil war” in Europe during the summer, in which a massive prop - aganda offensive would be followed by a wave of political strikes. 8 The question was how to respond to the internal communist challenge in Europe. Pietro Quaroni and George Ball, who presented introductory papers on this topic, both argued that as the immediate threat of military aggression had receded, the Cold War would be fought mainly on the politi - cal and economic fronts. In practice, this meant an ideological battle for the allegiance of the uncommitted people in Europe. The enormous economic and social disruptions caused by war, industrialization, and technological change had created a fertile ground for communism. Ball argued that in or - der to restore Western Europe’s faith in democracy and freedom, the social, economic, and political frustrations of millions of Europeans needed to be addressed. 9 Quaroni made essentially the same point. No war, he said, had ever been won by remaining on the defensive. Moreover, the Cold War was bound to be a long conflict. Only if the Western societies proved capable of restoring their vitality could they count on ultimately winning the Cold War. At present, too many European countries seemed incapable of doing so: “Our weakness as Europeans is that we are dreaming of an impossible restoration of the world of before 1940. We sometimes resemble Dante’s the Damned, who march forwards with their heads turned backwards.” 10 Everyone present at Barbizon agreed that a restored belief in democracy and the Western socioeconomic system was urgently needed in this new phase of the Cold War. The Soviet leadership was attempting to decrease tensions with its new slogan of ‘peaceful coexistence’ and its calls for nu - clear disarmament. While talking coexistence, however, Moscow continued to practice a strategy of undermining Western Europe’s social and political order.

There is a man working qui- etly to destroy us. [...] We are choosing to go, as Mr. Pinay said at our last meeting, to a nice gentle death; and it is certain to come unless we take vigorous, definite and effective action [...]. 11 But what kind of action would be effective against the Soviet-directed cam- paign of propaganda and disruption? Paul Rijkens’ suggestion that com - munist activities should be forbidden by law met with a mostly negative response. In Italy, Quaroni said, it would be hard to deal with the conse - quences of such a law, considering there were about 2 million party mem - bers. But apart from the practical difficulties, most participants agreed that it was the wrong approach. They regretted the fact that democracies were so ill-equipped to deal with internal threats, but to destroy democracy in order to save it was foolish. Mollet added that communism was similar to a religious movement and that the making of martyrs had never hindered the expansion of a religion. 12 Rijkens’ proposal to establish a common organization to fight commu - nist propaganda – some sort of “democintern” – also found little support. 13 NATO already dealt with international communist front organizations, such as the international peace campaign. On the national level, moreover, a standardized Western response made little sense. Healey warned that a single Western organization would be perceived as an operation run by the Americans, which would destroy its credibility in many European coun - tries. He added that even the Bilderberg Group ran this risk: if the meetings received too much publicity, this “could be extremely damaging to our com - mon desires.” 14 Several speakers now turned to the idea of a politically and economically integrated Europe in response to the communist challenge. The political vi - sion of Europe, they argued, could serve to bring back into the fold all those who were disillusioned with Europe’s democratic systems. At the same time, European economic integration would serve to overcome the many national barriers against reform that were still in place in many Western European countries. 15 Mollet was one of those who made this point. He explained that any reform- or iented government in France was, at present, more or less doomed to failure because of two interrelated factors. First, there was the presence of a good hundred communist deputies in the Assemblée Nationale . A group of obstructionist right-wing parliamentarians did not hesitate to cooperate with the communists if it served their needs. The moderate parties on the left were forced to participate in – or support – governments that held so little attraction to working class voters that the situation worked into the"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Integrating Europe 123 h ands of the communists. Second, whenever a government came close to realizing a program of true reforms, the right brought it down, either with the help of the communists – as in the case of the EDC – or by invoking the confessional question. 16 The best way to overcome the national deadlock in France was European integration. Contrary to the impression left by the EDC debacle, Mollet said, European integration was one of the few issues for which a relatively certain majority existed in the French parliament. 17 It was the linking of a political Europe with a military Europe – particularly, of course, with a rearmed Germany – that had been fatal. Anti-German sentiments in France and fears of a renewed German militarism had decisively undermined the pro-European consensus. The British also shared part of the blame because of their failure to participate more closely in the EDC. This did not mean, Mollet emphasized, that Europe was a lost cause; on the contrary, if Europe would now focus on economic integration, a clear majority (“450 votes” as he put it) existed to support it. 18 Mollet was not alone in envisioning such a role for a united Europe. The Italian industrialist Alberto Pirelli, for example, made much the same point. Pirelli explained that one of the key problems facing his country was the economic development of the relatively backward regions in Southern It a ly. What was needed was a combination of government investment and pri - vate initiative. At present, however, investment from outside of Italy was not forthcoming. Pirelli argued that such investment was not only econom - ically profitable, but that it could also play a major part “in the sphere of anti-communism.” In this context, he continued, nothing would help more than an economically united Europe, within which economic conditions [...] would be comparable, to establish sol - idarity against communism. This would help Europe regain the confi- dence and optimism which have been her driving force in previous times and be the greatest bulwark against communism. 19 George Ball, who had already made the case for uniting Europe at the first Bilderberg Conference, agreed. “The cure for the [disease] of neutralism,” he argued, lies not in words but in deeds; [...] it lies in taking those steps which can give a new element of faith, a new desire to fight for the ideas of the West, and that must necessarily come from the correction of social, economic and political frustrations which tend to create a climate for neutralism. 20 In the case of France, the causes of neutralism were complex and mani - fold, but at the heart of it was “a deeply-felt intellectual despair and frus - tration.” To restore faith in the “validity of France,” the political instability"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"124 Integrating Europe a nd ineffectiveness of the Fourth Republic should be dealt with. One way to do so, Ball said, was by creating “a new concept and a new system of alle - giances through the creation of [a] Federal Europe.” 21 The discussion at Barbizon shows that the combined ideological and socioeconomic challenges posed by communism served as a catalyst for Eu ropean integration at a time when the European project seemed to have lost its momentum. Aware of the effectiveness of Soviet propaganda and aware of the widespread lack of faith in Western Europe in the existing eco - nomic and political structures, many Bilderberg participants regarded inte - gration as the best way to restore Europe to its former vitality. The Belgian socialist Senator Fernand Dehousse put it most dramatically when he said that uniting Europe amounted to “the rescue of western civilization.” 22 The Dutch Foreign Minister Johan Willem Beyen, who was kept fully in - formed on the Bilderberg Meetings by Prince Bernhard, will have taken notice of Mollet’s promise of 450 certain votes. 23 After the Paris Agreements – which made the Federal Republic a sovereign member of NATO and created the Western European Union (WEU) to safeguard certain limits imposed on West German rearmament – had been ratified in May 1955, Beyen and his Benelux colleagues decided that the time was ripe for another go at building Europe. Paul-Henri Spaak, the Belgian Foreign Minister, and Jean Monnet had al - ready developed a plan for further vertical integration along the lines of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in the fields of atomic energy, transport, and electricity. Beyen insisted on including a proposal for broad horizontal integration in a European common market. At the Messina confer - ence of the Six in June 1955, the French and Germans reluctantly accepted a Benelux proposal to institute a committee to study these plans. 24 Shortly after the Messina conference, Spaak himself was named chair - man of this committee. The Belgian foreign minister had little interest in the details and intricacies of the economic questions involved, but his lack in expertise was far outweighed by his political experience and his Eur opean connections. In April 1956, the committee produced the Spaak report, which would serve as the basis for official negotiations among the Six leading to the Rome Treaties signed in March 1957. After the Barbizon conference, the Bilderberg organizers were eager to comply with President Eisenhower’s call for practical suggestions. Prince Bernhard personally invited a group of international trade unionists, in - cluding the President of the International Confederation of Free Trade Un ions, Omer Becu, to Soestdijk Palace in order to convince them of the need for more effective action against communist infiltration in trade un - ions. 25 In addition, Bernhard sent the transcripts of the first day of the Barbizon meeting to Louis Einthoven, the head of the Dutch secret service ( Binnenlandse Veiligheidsdienst , or BVD), and asked him to draw some con- clusions about the most effective means to counter communist propaganda and infiltration. 26 These recommendations would then be sent to SHAPE, the NATO headquarters in Paris. 27"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Integrating Europe 125 R etinger had the general report of the Barbizon conference printed as quickly as possible and also prepared a memorandum with definitions of coexistence from different countries. 28 All participants were urged “to use as much as possible the various meetings and conferences they attend to put forward the ideas and suggestions made at the Bilderberg Co nferences.” 29 Given the “the outstanding quality and influence of the members of the Bi lderberg group” Retinger felt that this could have a significant impact on public opinion. 30 A European common market At the third Bilderberg conference in Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Se ptember 1955, the relance européenne was discussed at length. Beyen himself con - tributed a paper and underlined the Cold War implications of European integration: An increasing prosperity of the entire Western world and the discard- ing of irritating protection are undoubtedly important factors in the present cold war situation. The higher level of prosperity provides an economically sound basis for the defence effort and, on the other hand, deprives communism in the West of its breeding ground of poverty. Specialization in production is likely to lead to interlocking commercial and industrial interests and to close contacts between industries sepa - rated by national boundaries, all of which will in the long run further political solidarity. 31 The discussions at Garmisch also revealed two additional arguments in fa- vor of the Messina initiatives. The first revolved around the economic ration - ale for a European market. The second made a broader case for Eur opean integration, hinging on the German question. During the course of the dis - cussions it became clear that the two were closely related. Louis Camu, Paul Rijkens, and the Yale-educated French economist and former Secretary-General of the OEEC Robert Marjolin all advanced the economic arguments for a European common market. Camu said that a common market would have a far more profound psychological effect than further vertical integration. Thousands of European firms would be forced to rationalize their operations and raise productivity if they were confronted with larger markets and increased international competition. Echoing Da vid Rockefeller’s presentation at the first Bilderberg conference, Camu argued that the result would be a general improvement in living standards and employment. Rijkens agreed and predicted an immediate positive ef - fect on the European economy, even if it would take a decade to establish a common market. 32 Marjolin also made a strong case for the common market and emphasized its importance for the French economy. Marjolin had resigned in April 1955"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"126 Integrating Europe a s secretary general of the OEEC because he was convinced that further liberalization of trade in the OEEC context was impossible. 33 In the paper he contributed to the Garmisch conference, Marjolin identified expanding intra-European trade since 1947 as “one of the great factors of European stability and progress.” 34 Europe was well on its way to regain its former position in world trade, which had a favorable effect on the overall balance of payments situation. However, in order to reach a more stable situation, European dependence on American aid and special expenditures had to be diminished even further. Consequently, a continued expansion of inter - national trade was called for. Marjolin said that at the moment this was essentially a European responsibility. With the exception of France, the lib - eralization of trade in Europe by means of the abolition of quota restrictions had run its course. 35 The reduction of tariffs should be the next step. Marjolin argued that the ultimate goal of liberalization should remain a global, multilateral system of free trade and payments. But in order to get there, the European countries first had to raise their productivity. At the moment, Europe was largely incapable of competing with the United States. To overcome the productivity gap, European producers should be progres - sively exposed to more competition. For this reason, Marjolin strongly supported Beyen’s Messina initiative. As he put it: “We want the common market because it will create competition among the European countries.” 36 This applied in particular to France. At the moment, France seemed to fare well enough with an elaborate system of import restrictions and export subsidies. “We may be able to live rather comfortably now,” Marjolin said, without making much effort, but in the long run our industries are suf - fering, productivity is lagging, and I am afraid that in France we may look up in a few years and find ourselves outdistanced not only by the United States but by other European countries. 37 The only way to overcome the French apathy was by confronting producers with increased competition. 38 In reply to critical remarks from British and Canadian participants, who feared the creation of a protectionist continen - tal trading bloc, Marjolin added that a European customs union would have to adhere to GATT rules. This meant that the external tariff of the union would be as low as possible. In addition, multilateral efforts at trade liberal - ization should continue parallel to the creation of a customs union. The question of Great Britain and Europe came up repeatedly. The editor of The Economist , Geoffrey Crowther, predicted that the United Kingdom would not be willing to join a common market. This was hardly a surprise to most participants. More important was that men such as Guy Mollet, who had long insisted on British participation in Europe, now made clear that the Europe of the Six needed to proceed without the United Kingdom. Amintore Fanfani, the leader of the Italian Christian Democrats, added"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Integrating Europe 127 t hat a recent meeting of the Nouvelles Équipes Internationales in Salzburg had reached the same conclusion. 39 Fanfani reasoned that Europe would have to develop at different speeds. The nucleus of the Six had to lead the way, while leaving the door open to the British and others. 40 Jean Drapier, Spaak’s close associate and the chairman of the EM’s executive bureau, agreed and called the Europe of the Six the “dynamic center of the con - struction of Europe.” 41 In contrast with the British participants, the Americans strongly en - couraged the plans for a common market – as they had done ever since the Marshall Plan. Under Secretary of State Robert D. Murphy and Paul G. Hoffman, the former ECA director, both emphasized the many advan - tages of creating a larger market. Hoffman recounted how he had made a speech in 1949 calling for a large European market. It was, in fact, during this speech that Hoffman had coined the term ‘European integration,’ after his advisers in the State Department told him that the term ‘unity’ was too much for the politically sensitive Europeans. At the Barbizon Conference, President Eisenhower’s economic advisor Gabriel Hauge had already emphasized the importance of a clear under - standing of the American system in view of the communist challenge. 42 Hauge acknowledged that there has been a debilitating lack of faith among our own people in the ability of the free economy to be stable, to grow and to meet the needs and the justifiable expectations which our people have placed upon it. The communists seized on these doubts to predict the inevitable collapse of the capitalist system. As far as our own country is concerned [Hauge explained], we are seek - ing to develop as evidence that our kind of economic system, that you and I and all of us here are generally dedicated to, can work. It is [...] an attempt to devise a fluid economy with a fair chance. It is an attempt to have an economic system in which my more need not be your less and thereby help to cut the ground out from a lot of the propaganda that faces us. I think we, in seeking to achieve this objective in our coun- try, are trying to introduce the maximum amount of freedom to change in our economic system, because growth comes through change and causes change. The maximum amount of freedom did not mean complete laissez faire . Hauge assured the European participants that the lessons of the Great De pression had been learnt. A set of rules and regulations, combined with “sustaining forces” provided by the government, was in place to prevent the normal fluctuations of a free economic system from spiraling out of"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"128 Integrating Europe c ontrol. 43 Reporting on the Barbizon conference to President Eisenhower Hauge wrote: It was interesting to observe in these discussions how various Europeans, who have their assorted gripes against the U.S., time after time cited our country and our economy as evidence of what the free way of life could produce in contrast to the Communist. 44 At Garmisch, the American participants added a technological consider - ation with respect to the plans for an atomic energy community. Walker Cisler, chairman of the board of the Detroit Edison Company and one of the leading American experts on the commercial use of atomic energy, held a long presentation on this point in front of a spellbound European audience and had to answer multiple questions. He argued that the sheer scale of the necessary investments called for an integrated effort. Hoffman reinforced Cisler’s argument by saying that much of the United States’ gains in pro - ductivity since 1900 had come from the development of nonhuman energy sources. Europe needed to catch up to the United States in this respect and should not miss the boat on atomic energy. In the words of Hoffman: If nationalism creeps into this situation and each country endeavours to work on its own and develop atomic energy, the result will be that they will lag far behind the United States. On the other hand, I believe that if the European nations pool their brain power and their resources they can compete with us more than successfully, and I assure you that there is nothing that would please me more, because that is the way I believe that you can over the next 50 years write a history entirely different from the history of Europe for the past 50 years. 45 Prince Bernhard wrapped up the session by saying: one thing [...] has emerged from our discussions yesterday and today, very clearly in my mind. From all speeches there has been practically unanimity of all the people present here, that it is of the utmost im - portance to take the quickest possible steps toward the integration of Europe. 46 The German question Two months before the Garmisch meeting, the Federal Republic had been officially welcomed as a member of NATO. This was, no doubt, a vindica- tion of Adenauer’s policy of Westbindung . Only ten years after the end of the war, West Germany regained its sovereignty (or most of it) and became a member of the Atlantic alliance. This remarkable fact has led many his - torians to treat West Germany’s admission into NATO as the culmination"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Integrating Europe 129 p oint of the process of Westbindung . Not all go as far as John Gillingham, who has argued that by May 1955 “the German Problem had disappeared almost unseen,” but there is a tendency to consider the problem as having lost much of its urgency. 47 Such readings, however, fail to take into account the fact that the German question was still wide open in 1955 and, more im - portantly, that it had the potential to undo all the efforts that resulted in the Paris Agreements. In other words, the Westbindung of the Federal Republic was by no means as secure as some historians have assumed. 48 This, at least, was the prevailing sentiment at the Garmisch meeting: the fear of a second Rapallo was in the air. The fact that earlier in September Adenauer had traveled to Moscow increased concerns about a renewed Ge rman turn eastwards in order to achieve reunification. 49 In Denis He a ley’s e vocative phrase: “[...] we must all admit that a western policy which is based on the division of Germany has a time bomb at the very heart of it.” 50 Ambassador Quaroni’s paper on the German question left no doubt that a settlement with the Soviet Union was unlikely in the near future. “German unity can only be achieved,” Quaroni argued, within the framework of a complete and radical transformation of the relations between East and West, or else as a result of complete capitu - lation by either East or West. Which means, in less diplomatic language, that the reunification of Germany will not be achieved. 51 Understandably, the German participants at Garmisch found this diffi - cult to accept. Fritz Erler, a leading SPD politician and vice chairman of the Bundestag Defense Committee, objected strongly to Quaroni’s conclu - sions. 52 He conceded that in the present circumstances no solution seemed possible, but disagreed with the implication of Quaroni’s paper that time would work in favor of the free world. In Erler’s view, the massive commu - nist indoctrination of the East German population posed a greater threat. The younger East German generations were in danger of being entirely lost to the democratic world because they had experienced nothing but totalitar - ian systems since the demise of the Weimar Republic in 1933. Having him - self witnessed the effects of totalitarian indoctrination, Erler argued that a speedy resolution of the German question was in the interest of the West. It followed, according to Erler, that Germany’s membership in NATO should not be allowed to block negotiations with Moscow. If the door remained closed to a Four Power agreement, pressures in the Federal Re public to start direct negotiations with East Germany would be hard to resist. In that case, Moscow would have the better cards to decide the fu - ture of Ge rmany. Carlo Schmid added that, although no party could say so openly in West Germany, he thought that on the difficult question of the Oder-Neisse line concessions by Germany were unavoidable. 53 Perhaps this could open the door to real negotiations. Schmid underlined Erler’s point that from the Soviet point of view, it was no use to talk of reunification as"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"130 Integrating Europe l ong as the Paris Agreements applied. A reunified Germany within NATO was unacceptable to Moscow. The debate that followed hinged on the question whether the risk of wait - ing trumped the risk of reaching a settlement that accommodated Soviet interests. Erler had made the case for rapid action. In contrast, Kurt Georg Kiesinger, a Christian Democratic Union (CDU) politician and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Bundestag , counseled patience and tried to reassure his audience of Bonn’s steady course. Kiesinger drew on his experience in Moscow to indicate that, although a solution at the pres - ent time was not in sight, in the longer term a settlement leaving a reunified Germany inside NATO might be possible. 54 The Soviet leadership had told the German delegation in Moscow that they were convinced that the current Western leaders sincerely wanted peace. Yet the communist leaders had not suddenly abandoned their ideology. They still believed in the communist prophecy that “some day the capitalist world will make a last desperate at - tack against the home of Communism.” The Soviet leaders had also told Kiesinger that they favored a period of détente and peaceful coexistence for two reasons: first, “to finish what they intend to do in Russia,” and second, to assist in the development and industrialization of China. Kiesinger thought the Soviet leaders had been “romantic about what they planned and what they wanted to do [...].” 55 He speculated that, by taking account of both the Soviet yearning for security and their need for economic development, a combined offer of a security system and economic aid might have success in the future. In the meantime, the West would have to be patient and firm. Most speakers at Garmisch favored Kiesinger’s position. Qualified sup - port for the SPD position came mainly from Paul van Zeeland and Denis Healey, who both emphasized the need to negotiate. Van Zeeland called the German question the neuralgic point of the Cold War. Without solving this problem, a lasting peace was not possible. He agreed with Fritz Erler that time was not working in the favor of the West and that everything should be done to find a solution that satisfied the security needs of both the West and the Soviet Union, without endangering the freedom of Germany. Van Zeeland suggested that German reunification might be attained in the con - text of a broader “global” deal including a demilitarized zone and a gen - eral agreement on disarmament. The Locarno Pact, he thought, should be looked at for further inspiration. 56 Denis Healey was thinking in similar terms. His “time bomb” simile un - derlined the inherent instability of the division of Germany and Europe. Healey also made clear that he thought German pressure for reunification would increase, as indeed it had in recent months. He suggested that some form of disengagement might be necessary, adding immediately that he had not made up his mind on this issue and that he was a strong supporter of NATO. Still, the idea of a “buffer zone between America and Russia large enough to subsist on its own” seemed attractive if it solved the German"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Integrating Europe 131 p uzzle and if it detached the satellite countries from the Soviet sphere of in - fluence. 57 Healey’s intervention was criticized by, among others, the former Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs Eelco van Kleffens, who pointed to the risk of breaking up the Atlantic alliance. Healey’s use of the word disen - gagement reminded van Kleffens of a line in Goethe’s Faust: “ Du sprichst ein grosses [sic] Wort gelassen aus. ” 58 George Kennan had long argued that accepting or even solidifying the continued division of Germany was a dangerous policy. 59 The Germans themselves would, in the long run, not go along with this policy. If they attempted to force the issue by themselves, they might get the United States involved in a general war with the Soviet Union, as Moscow could not be ex - pected to give up Eastern Germany without a fight. Kennan had repeatedly warned that the West did not show enough flexibility in the negotiations with Moscow. Now that West Germany had become a member of the alli - ance, he privately held a somber outlook for the future. During the Garmisch discussions, Kennan saw his worries confirmed. He told the conference that Khrushchev had not been joking when he de - clared that Germany’s membership in NATO was unacceptable as a basis for negotiations. Instead of negotiating with the Western powers, the Soviet leaders would try to deal directly with Bonn with tempting economic offers. If Schmid’s and Kiesinger’s accounts of their Moscow visit were any indica - tion, they were already busy laying the groundwork for such a move. In light of similar experiences in the 1920s and 1930s, Kennan warned the German participants that they should be wary of such offers. 60 In addition, Moscow would focus on “what they regard as the Achilles Heel of the Western position in Germany, and that is Berlin.” Based on the experiences of the first Berlin blockade, Kennan predicted (correctly, as it would turn out in 1958) that Moscow would again use West Berlin as a le - ver for pressuring the West. Starting with minor encroachments, Ken nan thought, the Soviets would make life for the civilian population more and more difficult. All Western efforts to negotiate would be referred to the East German authorities in an attempt to “make an honest and respectable woman out of the East German régime.” “Now the purpose of all this will be, of course,” Kennan said, initially to obtain for Moscow a voice in the internal councils of Ge rmany, in effect, and I think only when that first goal has been achieved will the second task be approached, with all seriousness, and that is the task – as they see it – of liquidating all West German military ties to the Western Powers. 61 After Kennan’s pessimistic outlook it was up to Walter Hallstein, Ad enauer’s trusted state secretary in the foreign ministry, to defend the foreign policy of the Adenauer government. Like all West German speak - ers, he started from the premise that “reunification must be brought about"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"132 Integrating Europe i f there is to be lasting order in the international situation.” 62 With respect to the Oder-Neisse line, Hallstein said that this problem could only be solved by a reunified Germany. He emphasized, however, that the West German government would not act without the full agreement of its al - lies. Moreover, Bonn was convinced of the need to combine “patience and initiative,” although it would be difficult to keep German public opinion in line. Like Kiesinger, Hallstein felt compelled to express a more optimistic view on the chances for reaching a settlement with Moscow than he may have believed in private. Hallstein asserted that the West should work with “the assumption that there is a price for which the Russians can be brought to agree to German reunification.” 63 Repeating Kiesinger’s point, Hallstein in - dicated that the economic difficulties in the Soviet Union might create the conditions for a deal with Moscow. Based on the recent talks in Moscow, Hallstein had concluded that their economic problems were very serious. It made sense, therefore, “[...] to find out if the interest they have in getting rid of these difficulties – their fear, their economic needs – is big enough to bring them to an agreement on German reunification.” 64 Despite Hallstein’s and Kiesinger’s efforts, the overall tenor of the Garmisch discussion on the German question remained one of deep concern. Immedi - ately after the Bilderberg conference, a large group of Am erican participants traveled on to Luxembourg for a visit to the ECSC. As Max Kohnstamm, who was about to become Jean Monnet’s right hand at the Action Committee for a United States of Europe, confided to his diary, they had left Garmisch wor - ried about the “complete uncertainty with respect to German foreign policy.” 65 Kennan told Kohnstamm that Walter Lippmann had been right after all, ob - viously referring to Lippmann’s opposition to the creation of a West German state in the late 1940s. 66 Back in the United States, Kennan felt compelled to publicize his views, providing Joseph and Stewart Alsop with a copy of his “Letter on G e r m a ny.” 67 Comparing the letter to his famous 1946 Long Telegram, the Alsop brothers wrote: [t]his Kennan letter shatters almost as many happy illusions as the his - toric Kennan dispatch of a decade past. It suggests, in fact, that the current Foreign Ministers’ meeting at Geneva is a mere way station to the grand nightmare of western diplomacy, which is a German reversal of alliances. 68 After the column was published, George Ball informed Lippmann that Kennan’s letter was based on the Garmisch conference. According to Ball, the letter “reflects the reactions which most of us had there to the state of mind prevailing among the Germans returning from Moscow.” 69 George McGhee also told Dean Rusk that “one got also the impression that if we were not successful in achieving German unity on the basis we desired, that it would be achieved in some other way.” 70"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Integrating Europe 133 I n his “Letter on Germany,” Kennan called the West Germans who had just returned from Moscow “somewhat shaky,” adding: please don’t misunderstand me. These men are as much Westerners, in every fiber of their being, as you and I [...] They know, in the wooing of which they are the objects, that they have to do with a siren, and they are miserably conscious of the frequent and, in this instance, wholly probable wages of sin. And still the lady’s image haunts their dreams and they can’t get away from it. 71 In Kennan’s almost Freudian analysis, the West Germans were tempted by the thought of direct negotiations with Moscow. They were also “intoxi - cated” by meeting one-on-one with the Soviet leadership, a leadership which speaks with one voice rather than three; which has something to give and is capable of delivering it if it wants to; and, above all, which talks the language of political realism to which Central Europeans are accustomed; brutal, cynical, in one sense crude, but in another infinitely subtle and sensitive. 72 The Garmisch discussions indicate that despite the ratification of the Paris Agreements, the German question was by no means put to rest. To many Bilderberg participants, the Federal Republic’s membership in NATO and the WEU was simply not a sufficient guarantee of Germany’s Westbindung . The lessons of the 1920s and 1930s formed an additional reason. The prom- inent Dutch social-democratic politician and member of the Consultative Assembly in Strasbourg, Paul J. Kapteyn, explained why: [The Germans] have to import in order to live, and they have to pay for these imports, and they have to export in order to pay for the imports. But that people of 50 million, wanting to work, to strive and to thrive, they have not the pleasure of being a member of the Commonwealth, nor do they belong to l’Union Française, and so there is no territory in the world where they have preferential rights. Today we are living through a boom; all is well in Germany and in Western Europe [ ...] But is there anybody here who believes that the prosperity of today is eternal prosperity? If a serious economic crisis developed, Kapteyn argued, other countries would close their borders to German exports. A similar situation to the one in the 1930s could easily develop. As Kapteyn put it: That is the moment for radicalisation for the German people. That is what we are afraid of, and that is why I am saying it will not be their fault if anything is going to happen – it will be our fault, if we do not succeed in bringing them together with us in a European union and creating a common market. 73"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"134 Integrating Europe G uy Mollet agreed with Kapteyn and added another consideration. In his view, Germany had to be protected against itself and against the temptation of another Rapallo. Mollet argued that German nationalism had not simply disappeared after the war. For some Germans, European integration had been nothing more than a means to an end. Now that the goal of sover - eignty had been achieved, they might turn their attention eastwards. Here, inevitably, Moscow held the important trump cards. The Soviets controlled Germany’s traditional eastern markets as well as the territories beyond the Oder-Neisse. What if they offered the West Germans a tempting offer of reunification including those lost lands? A repeat of Rapallo and a “renais - sance” of German nationalism would be the result, Mollet predicted. In addition, he said, the West would face a catastrophic deterioration of its position vis-à-vis the Soviet Bloc. The best way to prevent a second Rapallo, Mollet continued, was to tie the Federal Republic as closely as possible to the West. As Mollet put it in the report he wrote for the conference: However important the economic questions may be, it would be naive to think that they alone affect the construction of Europe. The German problem is more than ever at the heart of our difficulties and Germany’s destiny will seal that of Europe. For me, the aim is still a Germany po - litically and economically integrated in a European Community which would have authority over Germany in the same way as over the other member-countries. Only such a structure would assure stability and power to Europe, and would not be a stake between two blocs but a factor for peace. 74 At the same time, Germany should be given the chance to develop its eco - nomic potential in a large European market. As he had done earlier at Barbizon, Mollet argued that the same parlia - ment that had killed the EDC would have ratified a project of economic integration. By forcing the issue of military and political integration in the EDC, opponents of integration had been given the opportunity to create a false dichotomy in the public mind by juxtaposing the terms independ - ence and supranationality. They created the impression that independence equaled sovereignty. Mollet argued that this was a dangerous mispercep - tion. In any functioning society, individuals or groups accepted certain lim - its on their individual freedom in order to protect and enhance the freedom and independence of all. The same was now true for the nation-states of Europe. 75 They were no longer in a position to solve their economic, social, and political problems on their own. To protect and enhance their inde - pendence and security, a degree of sharing or transferring of sovereignty wa s ne c e s s a r y. Mollet therefore strongly agreed with Marjolin that a common market was an economic necessity in order to make Europe’s economies more"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Integrating Europe 135 c ompetitive. He indicated that the common market held out great hopes for “economic expansion,” adding that from the socialist point of view it could also become a “means of social progress.” On the other hand, he ac - knowledged the many difficulties involved in establishing a common mar - ket. Mollet suggested that it could only be done gradually, starting with measures to harmonize “diverse social regulations” and with the creation of a European investment fund. In France, the “fears of growing external competition” had to be taken into account. 76 Mollet’s message was targeted especially at his fellow social democrats Carlo Schmid and Fritz Erler. The SPD had opposed the ECSC, and impor - tant sections of the party were still critical of European integration because it would make German reunification more difficult. To them, Mollet said that reunification could not proceed at the expense of integration: For us, if this is about integrating and unifying, we agree, but if this is about choosing between unification and integration, I have to say, on behalf of an important part of French public opinion, that we do not agree; if it is necessary to pay for the unification of Germany with the severance, in the short or long term, of the ties that currently unite the Federal Republic and the Free World, and the stronger ties that need to unite us tomorrow, we say “Non.” 77 This was clear language on the part of the French socialist leader, who sev - eral months later formed a left-wing government. It confirms French For eig n Minister Christian Pineau’s testimony that Mollet (and a select group of pro-Europeans in his vicinity) were in favor of the common market from the start. 78 It was for tactical reasons that the Mollet government long showed a preference for Euratom. As Marjolin wrote in his memoirs, time was des - perately needed to convince different constituencies and interest groups of the necessity for breaking down France’s trade barriers. Indeed, Mollet warned at Garmisch that France was not yet ready for the idea of growing competition. He himself was convinced of the need to create a European common market; what needed to be done was to convince the French public and parliament. 79 With Walter Hallstein, Fritz Berg, Kurt Georg Kiesinger, Carlo Schmid, and several other prominent Germans present, Mollet’s and Marjolin’s con - tributions will have been shared in influential circles in the Federal Rep ublic, including Chancellor Adenauer himself. For the conservative chancellor in Bonn, after all, this was a vital piece of information, indicating that the so - cialist leader from France was a reliable partner in building Europe. The next two Bilderberg conferences, in March 1956 and February 1957, did not feature extended discussions on European integration. Two pressing issues that threatened to divide the Atlantic alliance – the crisis of decoloni - zation and the approaching nuclear stalemate – dominated these me etings. 80 Both problems showed that despite the overwhelming convergence of"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"136 Integrating Europe i nterests and values between Western Europe and the United States, im - portant differences remained. Throughout 1956, European fears increased that Washington would decide to return to a ‘fortress America’ mentality in reaction to the fast-increasing Soviet capabilities to reach the United States with nuclear weapons. Moreover, the transatlantic differences over the colonial question could not be easily bridged, as the Algerian crisis and the Suez affair proved. The fact that Washington did not react strongly to Khrushchev’s rocket-rattling during the Suez crisis further fueled European suspicions. Given Europe’s dependence on the Suez Canal for oil shipments, the case for Euratom and the common market suddenly looked a lot more convincing to many original doubters. The overall effect of the Suez crisis on the Rome Treaties negotiations remains in dispute. At the height of the crisis, on November 6–7, 1956, Ad enauer paid a controversial visit to Paris. The fact that during this visit a Franco-German compromise on several outstanding disagreements was quickly hammered out has led some historians to conclude that the final de - cision on the part of the French government to agree to the common market was decisively influenced by the Suez crisis. Others have pointed out that this decision was already made in September 1956. 81 Both positions have something to speak for them. As we have seen, there can be little doubt that Mollet himself was in favor of the common market well before the Suez crisis. There is also sufficient documentary evidence to trace the final decision of the French cabinet in favor of pursuing the common market to September 1956. On the other hand, it is often conven - iently forgotten that the Suez crisis began on July 26, 1956: the day Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal. This means that many of the implications of the Suez crisis played a role in the deliberations of the French cabinet dur - ing the summer of 1956. Not coincidentally, the French plan to include the French overseas territories in the common market – to create Eurafrique – was launched shortly after the failure of Suez, introducing Europe as a way to salvage France’s crumbling empire. Moreover, there can be little question that the dramatic ending of the Suez crisis in November 1956 gave added impetus to the drive for a united Europe. 82 This was true not only for France but also for the Federal Republic, where Adenauer used the crisis to reign in his Minister of Economic Affa irs, Lud wig Erhard, who opposed the common market. 83 The chancellor told Maurice Faure on September 17 that even in Britain, the “Suez shock” seemed to lead to a more positive attitude regarding European integration. 84 In his much- noted Brussels speech on September 25, Adenauer repeatedly referred to the Suez crisis as proof of the impotence of a divided Europe. Europe should finally act, the chancellor said, or risk becoming irrelevant. The Bilderberg Group and the Rome Treaties Three points stand out in the Bilderberg discussions concerning Europe at Barbizon and Garmisch. First, it is clear that European elites were deeply"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Integrating Europe 137 c oncerned about the combined ideological and socioeconomic challenge posed by international communism in the mid-1950s. Few works on the his - tory of European integration take this into account. 85 Yet as the Bar bizon discussions indicate, it was precisely this challenge that acted as an im - portant catalyst for European integration after the collapse of the EDC. A united Europe as a bulwark against communism, a united Europe as a way to overcome Europe’s structural socioeconomic problems and win back the allegiance of those who had lost faith in democracy – those were the ideas put forward at Barbizon. In the context of the Cold War, politics and economics could not be separated. The Cold War was perceived as a struggle against totalitarianism fought on all fronts: ideological, political, economic, cultural, and military. Seen in this light, the ‘European rescue of the nation-state’ through political and economic integration was nec - essary not only to secure the social and economic foundations of Europe, but also to protect democracy and freedom itself. 86 Moreover, in the face of the United States’ rise to economic superpower status and the loss of traditional markets because of decolonization, the realization that Europe needed a common market to restore its competitiveness only added weight to the argument. The second point concerns the German question. Ultimately, the German question was a matter of war and peace and therefore a political concern. As the Garmisch discussions show, however, men like Mollet envisioned an economic solution to this political problem. German economic expansion - ism was to be absorbed in a European market governed by a supranational authority. This had a double advantage: it minimized the risk of a repeat of Germany’s economic isolation during the recession of the 1930s and the resulting policy of autarchy and an aggressive search for Lebensraum . At the same time, the integration of West Germany into Europe lessened the danger of another Rapallo. Any Russian offer to West Germany – whether it concerned reunification, economic cooperation, or both – stood less chance of success if the Federal Republic was an integral part of Western Europe. In this perspective, the Rome Treaties reflected important lessons of his - tor y. 87 Shortsighted economic policies had led to disaster before. If we turn to the role of the United States in actively stimulating European integration, the third conclusion to emerge is that the Bilderberg Group was ideally suited for the kind of quiet, informal diplomacy that was required after the heavy-handed US strategy of the EDC had backfired. 88 It gave people like Ball, Hauge, Hoffman, Murphy, and Rockefeller the chance to influence European thinking in more subtle ways than Secretary of State Dulles had employed in 1953–1954. One of their most persuasive arguments concerned the extraordinary dynamism of the American economy. The idea that larger markets and more competition would lead to higher productiv - ity as the key to economic growth was particularly important in view of long-standing European traditions of protectionism. 89 The American ex - perience in developing the peaceful use of atomic energy provided another argument in favor of pooling European resources."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"138 Integrating Europe A s far as the historiography of European integration is concerned, these conclusions show that juxtaposing political and economic driving forces can be misleading. The question is not so much whether the Rome Treaties were a “political construct” (Wilfried Loth) or whether “the economic foun - dation of the treaties was more fundamental” (Alan Milward). 90 Rather, we should ask how the interplay between economic and political motives, inter - ests, and constraints led to the Rome Treaties. As the evidence from the Bilderberg Meetings suggests, the communist threat, the dynamics of the Cold War, and the German question were im - portant factors in this equation, bolstered by the lessons of history and a sense of emotional community. As the evidence also suggests, economic and political factors tended to reinforce, rather than contradict, each other. Years of discussions among US and European transnational elites had cre - ated wide-ranging support for a further liberalization of trade in order to raise competition and productivity; a European common market, much like the United States’ example, would serve this purpose. The strong interlink - age between all these factors goes a long way towards explaining the re - markably broad cross-party coalition that in the end supported the Rome Treaties, from socialists to conservatives and from trade unions to business and agricultural associations.

The chancellor’s trip caused many raised eyebrows in the West. Despite previous assurances that he would not establish diplomatic relations with Moscow unless definite progress on the ques - tion of German unification could be made, Adenauer did so in return for the release of the remaining 10.000 German prisoners in the Soviet Union. The Amer ican Ambassador in Moscow, Charles Bohlen, was enraged by what he considered a huge diplomatic victory for the Soviet Union. He even suspected a secret deal be - tween Adenauer and the Soviets. Felix von Eckardt, a close Ad enauer confidant, remembered how it took months to convince the Eisenhower Ad ministration that the Federal Republic could still be trusted.

How - ever, several days later, during a CDU- Bundesvorstand meeting, Kiesinger seemed much more in agreement with the Italian ambassador. He told his CDU colleagues that he doubted whether Moscow would ever agree to reunification if a reunified Germany was not safely integrated in the communist camp. It shows that one should be careful with taking statements on the German question at face value. Just as many American, British or French statements were mostly for West German consumption, West German politicians realized they had to keep the issue on the agenda of the West.

Most Bilderberg participants agreed that the global Cold War could well be decided there: if the West ‘lost’ major parts of the newly independent nations to communist expansion, the economic and political consequences could be dramatic. 1 However, given the overwhelm - i ng speed of decolonization – in the first decade of its existence the United Nations admitted Thailand, Pakistan, Burma, Indonesia, Cambodia, Ce ylon, Laos, Morocco, Sudan, and Tunisia as new members – and the divergent views on the timing and methods of dismantling Europe’s colonial territories, it proved impossible to forge a common transatlantic strategy with regard to the Third World. As Dean Rusk put it at the 1955 Barbizon Conference: The United States is caught in the middle between nationalist move - ments in other parts of the world and our friends in Europe. I can only say that there are no more excruciating problems for those who make policy than those arising out of colonial questions. 2 As this chapter shows, the Bilderberg discussions on decolonization did provide a much-needed forum to air grievances and to draw attention to the difficult political implications of the colonial question in most NATO countries. The Suez crisis was the most dramatic expression of transatlantic differences and led to much soul-searching at the 1957 Bilderberg confer - ence in the United States. In terms of practical solutions to the challenge of decolonization, the Bilderberg discussions focused strongly on economic development and technical assistance. This was important because many Bilderberg participants and members, from World Bank President Eugene Black to Eisenhower speechwriter C. D. Jackson, were engaged in private and public initiatives focused on development of the ‘underdeveloped world.’ The Bandung conference and the emergence of the Third World Starting in the second half of 1954, transatlantic differences over decol - onization became more important because of two related developments. 6 Decolonization and the global Col d War"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Decolonization and the global Cold War 145 F irst, the Soviet Union and China increased their efforts to bring the non- aligned countries of the Third World into the Communist bloc. At the very least, they attempted to create a sense of community among these countries based on their colonial experiences, the question of race, and a sense of inferiority vis-à-vis the West. Moscow’s leaders started traveling to countries such as India, offering help and advice on industrialization and spreading the communist gospel. The Soviet strategy of peaceful co - existence, in other words, meant the emergence of the Third World as an important new battlefield. Secondly, Indonesia and several other Asian countries took the initi - ative to organize a large conference in Bandung, Java bringing together leaders from Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. The Bandung confer - ence took place in the second half of April 1955 – a few weeks after the Bar bizon co nference – and gave a prominent world stage to neutralist and communist politicians such as India’s Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and China’s Zhou Enlai. 3 Nonalignment was one of the keywords of the c onference, as many of the world’s smaller nations considered ways of not being drawn into the Cold War. 4 There was no shortage of issues on the Bandung agenda with a decidedly anti-Western connotation. The history of colonialism and the remaining de - colonization conflicts no doubt were the most emotional ones, but many politicians, especially in Asia, were also worried about having to choose sides in the Cold War. They resented the fact that the United States had cre - ated the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) after the armistice in Indochina, and they wished to see the dangerous conflict between commu - nist China and the nationalist Chinese on Formosa – in which the United States played a key role – brought to an end. Last but not least, there was the question of race. As Antoine Pinay said at Barbizon: “For the first time we will see a Conference, organized at the initiative of communist coun - tries, representing almost one billion people at which no one representing the white race will be present.” 5 The Bandung conference presented China and, indirectly, the Soviet Un ion with an excellent opportunity to pose as the undisputed cham - pions of national independence. And there were limits to how much the West could do about this – at least through common action. As George Ball argued at Barbizon, the Bandung conference was partly a reaction to the habit on the part of the NATO countries to consult with each other before dealing with developing countries. “When this is done too openly, too obviously and too automatically,” Ball said, “it gives an impression of ganging-up which, I think, can have and does have sometimes unfor - tunate reactions on the part of the Eastern peoples.” 6 A complicating factor was the racial question in the United States itself. Ball acknowl - edged, “[...] the persistence of some degree of racial discrimination in the United States has been an effective and important weapon in the Soviet a r s e n a l.” 7"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"146 Decolonization and the global Cold War D enis Healey agreed and added that the West should avoid the impres - sion of treating Asia as part of the Cold War Western camp: We always talk about “West” and “East”, which in itself is a shocking sound in Asian ears – a Western front in the cold war. I remember once last year, for example, the Assistant Secretary in the State Department, Mr. Robertson, boasting in a public speech that America dominated Asia now. Well, that sort of talk is absolutely disastrous when dealing with these countries. 8 The Dutch diplomat Eelco van Kleffens, who had just served as president of the United Nations General Assembly in 1954, argued that the causes for anti-Western and anti-colonial feelings in many newly independent coun - tries were primarily psychological. For one, a distinct sense of inferiority existed, based on the technological edge of the industrialized world – what he called “an instinctive insurgence against the material preponderance of the West against which spiritual weapons are of slight avail and which there - fore strikes these nations as brute force.” 9 This feeling of inferiority was re - inforced by the widespread disappointment over the fact that independence had not brought the quick political or economic success everyone had hoped for. As van Kleffens said: “[...] those who carry through great revolutions are very rarely allowed to see them come to full fruition; just as Moses, having led the Jews out of serfdom, was not allowed to enter the Promised Land.” 10 This was, however, hard to accept for many, especially among the Asian and African intelligentsia. As a result, the (former) European colonial pow - ers and the United States with its overwhelming economic power were used as convenient scapegoats. “The ‘whites’,” van Kleffens argued, the ‘westerners’, the technocratic brutes against whom they feel power - less in spite of their independence and for whom, at the same time, they still feel a sort of intolerable respect, creating violent inner tensions – they are the cause of their impotence, the object of their resentment, the target of their thirst for compensation. 11 Van Kleffens warned that if nothing was done to analyze and respond to these feelings, the risk of losing many Asian and African countries polit - ically and militarily was considerable. Yet this was something only those Asian and African leaders could do who knew and understood the West and realized that their countries had more to gain from cooperation than antag - onism. Two such leaders, van Kleffens said, were General Carlos P. Romulo, the Philippine secretary for foreign affairs, and Sir John Kotelawala, the prime minister of Ceylon. After the Barbizon conference, Prince Bernhard sent both these men – as well as the Pakistani Prime Minister Chaudhry Muhammad Ali – a letter urging them to do something about anti-colonialist sentiments. “The answer"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Decolonization and the global Cold War 147 s eems to us,” Bernhard wrote, “that in Asia and Africa a better insight, psy - chologically, must be awakened regarding those feelings which superficially are called anti-colonialism.” As an analysis from the Western point of view, the Prince appended van Kleffens’ statement to his letter, writing: The conference was of the opinion that while we should by all means try to show every free country in the world that Communist rule and their way of life would be catastrophic for them, we should not ask them to opt for us or become our allies. 12 The important point was that anti-colonialist feelings should not be allowed to destroy economic, cultural, and political ties between their countries. During the run-up to the Bandung conference, American and British dip - lomats were trying to get much the same message across to the same Asian leaders. 13 Whatever the effect of Prince Bernhard’s letters, the outcome of the Bandung conference was not unsatisfactory from the Western point of view. 14 It was especially important that Sir Kotelawala – who belonged in the neutral - ist camp – put up an effective defense against the attempts by Nehru and Zhou Enlai to preach coexistence and focus primarily on the anti-colonial agenda of Bandung. On the other hand, the crisis of decolonization obviously remained an explosive issue. Prime Minister Muhammad Ali told Prince Bernhard that [i]t is very important that the non-communist Western Powers should, by respecting the national aspirations of peoples in areas still subject to their rule, remove the causes of real grievances still existing and give confidence to the independent Asian and African nations that there is no fundamental obstacle to cooperation with Western countries on the basis of friendship and equality. 15 Ali identified the “continued subjection” of much of North Africa – Mo rocco, Tunisia, Algeria – as the main area of concern. The second result of the Barbizon discussion of the ‘uncommitted people’ was the decision to hold a special conference on Asia. Joseph Retinger had already told Prince Bernhard a month before Barbizon that he thought the situation in Asia should be discussed in detail. Van Kleffens’ intervention led Retinger to abandon his usual reticence and make a rare speech to the Bilderberg participants. Retinger proclaimed himself in full agreement with van Kleffens’ analysis of the psychological causes of anti-Western feeling in Asia. He argued that preeminent thinkers of the West and Asia should be brought together to discuss this topic. The only question was whether the Bilderberg Group was the right organization to do so. When Prince Be rnhard announced that he did not think so, Denis de Rougemont volun - teered to pursue the idea and proposed to use his Geneva Centre Européen de la Culture for this purpose. 16 It was also decided that the Bilderberg con- ference in 1956 was to address the question of Asia."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"148 Decolonization and the global Cold War The question of economic development At Barbizon, the rest of the discussion concerning the Third World was spent mostly on the question of economic development. 17 Several speakers argued that an effort on the scale of the Marshall Plan was needed for the underdeveloped world. As Retinger wrote in a short memorandum for the Barbizon Conference: We have a responsibility, which is inherent in our very civilization and in our philosophy, to help them. We have also a vital interest to do so. Unless the Western world helps them effectively, they will accept com - munist aid, or at best turn away from us. 18 George McGhee argued that the principal front of the Cold War had moved from Europe to Asia. Economic and technical assistance was only one re - sponse to this challenge, but it was an important one, given the Soviet ac - tivities in this field and the high expectations in many developing countries. Inevitably, the quick industrialization of the Soviet Union through central planning offered a compelling story to the leaders of these mostly agrarian societies. The Bilderberg participants were aware that the struggle for Asia, Africa, and, to some extent, Latin America would be partially decided by the com - parison between the Soviet and Western economic methods. 19 Moreover, as Bertil Ohlin, Gabriel Hauge, and Paul van Zeeland argued: if the economic gap between ‘the haves and the have nots’ widened even further, this would only serve to increase anti-Western sentiments. Everyone present agreed that it was in the West’s interest to expand economic relations with the Third World as a basis for raising their living standards and keeping them out of the communist orbit. However, they were also aware that quick successes were an illusion and that it was important not to raise false hopes – despite the wish for rapid development in many Third World countries. McGhee, who had acquired vast experience in this field during his time as a diplomat in Turkey, Greece, and the Middle East, emphasized that fast economic development “is really artificial economic development.” 20 Very few examples of massive injections of foreign aid had led to a lasting increase in economic growth or living standards. As Gabriel Hauge added, the Marshall Plan for Europe had been about reconstruction: about rebuilding something that had existed. And unlike Europe, many countries in the developing world lacked the basic infrastructure, technical expertise, and institutions necessary for economic development. George Ball listed some of the key obstacles: ... in many of those areas there are few of the basic conditions pres - ent in which a capitalistic system can operate effectively: accumulated"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Decolonization and the global Cold War 149 s avings are meagre and poorly distributed; legal systems do not make it possible for property transfers to be easily effected, do not provide for the recognition of corporate organisms, or do not contain machinery permitting even land titles to be passed with certainty; manual labour is held in disdain and the prestige-indices of various occupations are wholly different from our own and under [those] circumstances rapid material progress within a capitalistic system may be quite impossible. 21 It followed, Bertil Ohlin said, that one of the most important questions was how to develop institutions that were “[...] compatible with the fundamental ideas and beliefs of the underdeveloped peoples [...]” yet also provided the framework for expanding trade and industry. 22 The West could not expect to export democratic capitalism to countries with a different political and social tradition. Another great problem, as Ohlin pointed out, was that large population increases caused such pressures in many underdeveloped areas that it was virtually impossible to raise their living standards. Reginald Maudling, a British conservative MP and Minister of Supply, concurred and argued that in Southeast Asia a strategy for birth control was perhaps the most important task of all. 23 The question how to organize economic assistance was fraught with similar difficulties. Several participants said that a concerted action on the part of the West was bound to be met with suspicion and hostility in Asia and elsewhere. Even foreign technical advisors were often seen – or por - trayed by communists – as agents of Western economic colonialism. The best solution was to organize development assistance on a loose bilateral or multilateral basis and to give as much responsibility as possible to inter - national organizations such as the International Bank for Reconstruction and De velopment (IBRD – also known as the World Bank). In addition, initiatives for economic development should come from the underdeveloped nations themselves. The Colombo Plan, originating in the early 1950s, was one way of doing so. Maudling explained that the “real secret of the Colombo Plan is that there is, in fact, no such plan. There is no blueprint at all.” 24 The participat - ing countries in Southeast Asia, Great Britain, Canada, Australia, Japan, and the United States got together to discuss development ideas and mutual aid. There was no question of certain ideas being imposed on the developing world. The underdeveloped countries were responsible for drawing up their own plans. Subsequently, the financial arrangements took place on a purely bilateral basis. Prince Bernhard argued in the paper he prepared for Barbizon that the actions of the World Bank and bilateral aid could never satisfy the need for capital in the underdeveloped world. 25 More should be done to involve private investment capital in economic development. Everyone agreed on this point, but again the problems involved were hard to overcome. As Jack Heinz argued in his paper, the “present world instability,” the many"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"150 Decolonization and the global Cold War i nvestment opportunities within the United States, and the lack of guaran - tees for private investment and property rights inhibited investors from in - vesting in the underdeveloped world. 26 The initiative of Eugene Black – the World Bank president who was widely praised at Barbizon – to create an International Finance Corporation (IFC) in order to channel private capi - tal to the developing world was therefore met with unanimous approval. 27 Ga briel Hauge predicted that Congress would pass Black’s proposal with - out difficulty. On the whole, the Barbizon meeting showed a broad awareness of the enormous complexity and difficulty of the task of developing the ‘under - developed world.’ This was true not only for Europeans with decades-long experience in these areas but also for some of the Americans. The Cold War cliché of the “Ugly American” – barging in to spread the American dream of free men and free enterprise to the rest of the world – did not apply to Bi lderberg participants such as McGhee, Ball, or Hauge. 28 Ball, for exam - ple, repeatedly opposed a heavy-handed, interventionist approach to the Third World, both with respect to spreading democracy and capitalism: I think it is perhaps a mistake for the West to attempt to sell its own ideology in entirety to the East in competition with communism for the reason that throughout the Middle East and extending in the north of Africa down to Pakistan and Indonesia, the mentality of the people is conditioned by the ideas of Islam; in the Far East it has been shaped by Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism. To Eastern peo - ples, Western conceptions of individualism – concepts which we have derived from our own religious systems, from the Renaissance to the Re formation and the Enlightenment – these ideas give a strongly ra - tionalistic and secular character to Western thought which may not be acceptable, at least for a very long time, to the peoples of the East. Western man believes in science and in progress; he believes that the individual is a fluid element in society, free to find a level commensurate with his ambitions and abilities, and I reiterate that to expect Eastern peoples to adjust to these economic and political ideas is not realistic. 29 Ball added that if any country should understand the wish of newly inde - pendent nations not to be involved in great power politics, it should be the United States, with its long history of isolationism. On the subject of eco - nomic assistance, Hauge sounded a similar note of caution. “In America,” he said, perhaps we are capable of great enthusiasm; we probably think we ought to remake every place in the image of Detroit, but I think as our experience grows, we do realize that we should develop the abil - ity not to scorn little things and modest beginnings which have good foundations. 30"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Decolonization and the global Cold War 151 The Fredensborg conference, May 1956 The Fredensborg conference, the fourth Bilderberg meeting, took place from May 11 to 13, 1956. Hakon Christiansen of the Danish East Asiatic Company was responsible for the organization, assisted by Ole Bjørn Kraft. The conference dealt mainly with Asia, but also featured a review of recent events. The Barbizon discussions had highlighted a simple truth: winning the allegiance of the uncommitted leaders of Asia and Africa had become a crucial objective for the West. It was no longer sufficient to organize the de - fensive perimeters of the Free World through organizations such as SE ATO. Just as the socioeconomic communist challenge in Western Europe neces - sitated a response that went far beyond military strength, the Third World battlefield also consisted predominantly of economic and political fronts. 31 The emergence of a distinct Afro-Asian identity at Bandung, based partly on both anti-Western nationalism and a neutralist distaste for being drawn into the Cold War, did not make this task any easier. If anti-Western sen - timents in the Third World were allowed to gain the upper hand, financial incentives, or technical assistance could do little to reverse the situation. At the abstract level, therefore, most Europeans and Americans agreed on the importance of the psychology of North-South relations. Yet it was vir - tually impossible to translate this agreement into actual policy. When push came to shove, the French in North Africa, the Belgians in the Congo, the Dutch in West New Guinea, or the British in the Middle East and elsewhere cared more about their immediate interests in these areas than about forg - ing a common Western attitude acceptable to the Third World. Conversely, many Americans (joined, of course, by quite a few Europeans) had little patience with what they regarded as the last gasps of European imperialism. Although these differences in outlook and interests were nothing new, the increased importance of good relations with the Bandung powers added to the poignancy of these differences. 32 What is more, Washington could no longer expect to overrule European objections to rapid decolonization as in the case of the Dutch East Indies in 1949. At that time, then-Secretary of State Dean Acheson threatened to withhold Marshall Plan and military aid to the Netherlands, more or less forcing The Hague to accept a deal with Sukarno. 33 An economically resurgent Western Europe was less suscepti - ble to such pressures, and more likely to revert to anti-Americanism, as the first Bilderberg conference had shown. Many Europeans also suspected that American anti-colonialism was partly based on a desire to supplant Eur opean interests in the Middle East and elsewhere. Such suspicions reinforced exist - ing anti-American reflexes. Consequently, the Eisenhower Administration had to navigate between the ‘Scylla’ of Third World anti-colonialism and the ‘Charybdis’ of Western European interests and NATO cohesion. Another impediment to a unified Western strategy towards the Third World was the changed threat perception of the Cold War in the context of"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"152 Decolonization and the global Cold War p eaceful coexistence. Although most Bilderbergers believed that the Soviet changes were tactical, and that continued vigilance was necessary, this was a difficult conclusion to sell to the wider public. As Paul Nitze said during the Fredensborg conference: [...] since September there has been a further development of the feel - ing that there is little immediate threat of military aggression from the Communists, a weakening of the bond of fear of a common enemy which holds the non-communist coalition together, and a coming to the sur - face of tensions on lesser issues among the members of the coalition. 34 One result – predicted already at the Garmisch conference – was that poli- ticians were experiencing increasing difficulties to finance the defense meas - ures necessary to fulfill the agreed NATO goals. In addition, member states were less inclined to consult on problems that did not officially fall within NATO’s area of responsibility. Two of the most important issues – Algeria and Cyprus – were not even strictly out-of-area, to use the modern term, but France and Great Britain resisted any meaningful discussion of these topics in the NATO Council. The overall effect upon the alliance was bad and the NATO ministerial meeting in early May 1956 failed to give the alliance a new sense of direc - tion. The only decision the NATO foreign ministers were able to make was to install another Wise Men Committee to study political consultation. Proposals for an increased NATO role in the economic field won little sup - port. French Foreign Minister Christian Pineau’s ambitious plan to create a world economic development agency under the auspices of the United Na tions (and including the Soviet Union) met the same fate. In Washington, Dulles told the National Security Council with a sense of understatement that “a certain lack of solidarity among the NATO powers was quite evident at the meeting.” The Cyprus crisis, the withdrawal of French NATO forces from Europe to Algeria, as well as Middle East policy in general had not been discussed in depth. Dulles had warned his NATO colleagues that if such issues continued to be “treated independently and unilaterally” the alliance would fall apart. 35 At Fredensborg, George Perkins, the US permanent representative to NATO, admitted that the NATO summit had mostly produced confused and rambling discussions. Denis Healey, always prepared to call a spade a spade, said the summit had been an “appalling disaster”, and Prince Bernhard quickly decided to move on to the next point on the Fredensborg agenda: “a common approach by the Western world towards China and the emergent nations of South and East Asia.” 36 The discussion concerning Southeast Asia covered essentially the same ground as the Barbizon conference. Again, several speakers made the point that concerted Western action was bound to be regarded as another exam - ple of Western domination. Robert L. Garner, vice president of the World"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Decolonization and the global Cold War 153 B ank, also confirmed the Barbizon conclusion that economic development took time and could not be imposed. He warned that giving too much money too fast was counterproductive, recalling how Turkey had been given so much money that it had ordered 20 cement plants, none of which were now working. Technical assistance and the development of private enter - prise were more effective. The problem was – as Dean Rusk reminded the conference – that the Soviets could promise quick help and point to their own experience with rapid industrialization. The recent visit by Khrushchev and Bulganin to In dia, Burma and Afghanistan was a good example. Paul Nitze agreed and argued that the Asian trip of the Soviet leaders “[...] may well be the Soviet move toward widespread economic assistance without strings and economic purchases for political purposes. In other words, the opening up of major political warfare with economic means.” 37 Several participants said that countries in the region inevitably compared Soviet activities to American behavior. As Gabriel Hauge told President Eisenhower in his report of the Fredensborg meeting: “The fact that Bulganin and Khruschev stayed three weeks in India was considered a great compliment. The fact that Dulles rushed through nine countries in ten days on his last trip there was viewed dimly for the opposite reason.” 38 A new element in the Fredensborg discussions was the question of com - munist China. Prince Bernhard had avoided the issue at Barbizon, because of its political sensitivity in the United States. Now, the Europeans no longer held back in their criticism of the inflexible American policy of nonrec - ognition and a comprehensive trade embargo against communist China. Sir John Slessor’s introductory paper was representative of European ma - jority opinion: [...] our refusal to recognize the government of, or trade with, the big - gest nation in the world (which makes no political or economic sense anyway) not only courts Chinese opposition to anything we do in Asia, but also increases our difficulties in the rest of Asia in that it keeps alive and indeed increases the dislike and suspicion of the West on the part of other Asiatic countries. Slessor argued that a common approach towards Asia could only be based on recognition of communist China, including giving her a place on the UN Security Council. By isolating communist China, the United States was driving her into the arms of Russia. Thus, any prospect of driving a wedge between the two countries was lost. Slessor realized that in an election year, it was unlikely to expect such a dramatic change of course in US policy, but any policy based just on anti- co mmunism and resentment over China’s role in Korea was bound to be sterile. “It seems necessary,” Slessor wrote, “to add that the initiative is as important in politics as in strategy and that demands a positive approach;"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"154 Decolonization and the global Cold War t he purely negative policy of anti-communism or anti-anything is going to get us nowhere.” 39 Most Americans present at Fredensborg were ready to admit that the Eisenhower Administration’s policy towards China had reached an im - passe. Still, the political reality in the United States dictated that without an important change of attitude on the part of communist China, no US adjustment was likely. Arthur Dean explained that in the United States, communist China was widely regarded as arrogant. Moreover, a compro - mise on the part of the United States could be interpreted in Beijing as a sign of weakness. US Assistant Secretary of State for International Org anization Affairs Francis O. Wilcox added that the American resentment over Korea could only be overcome if communist China showed more willingness to im - prove relations with the West. Then there was also the problem of Fo rmosa. Johnson and Rusk emphasized that the United States had an obligation to the defense of Formosa. 40 In reply, Alfred Robens, a leading Labour poli - tician, suggested that some form of UN trusteeship for Formosa could be arranged. He argued that it was important to get communist China in the United Nations, because the West “[c]an’t expect her to accept rules unless she is a member.” 41 If the American participants found themselves on the defensive with re - gard to the Chinese question, many Europeans showed great concern about their position in the Middle East and North Africa. Although these areas were not officially part of the agenda, recent events made it impossible to ig - nore them. The whole region was in ferment as a result of various nationalist or pan-Arab movements, increasing Soviet activities, Israeli-Arab tensions, and the growing importance of oil for the industrialized economies of the West. Ever since the Egyptian leader, Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser, had accepted an arms deal with Czechoslovakia in September 1955, the big three NATO powers were increasingly at odds on how to respond. 42 The Eisenhower Administration was inclined to give Nasser the benefit of the doubt and treat him more as an Arab nationalist than as a commu - nist ally. France and Great Britain, on the other hand, were just as wor - ried about Nasser’s pan-Arab ambitions as about Soviet incursions into the Mi ddle East. Different national priorities further inhibited Western cooper - ation in the region. Great Britain tried to build up its Iraqi ally through the Baghdad Pact, whereas the Eisenhower Administration preferred to rely on Saudi Arabia. For the French government led by Mollet, the Algerian rebel - lion trumped all other concerns. Nasser’s perceived support for the rebels – both materially and in terms of radio propaganda – was deeply resented in Paris. Broader French relations with the Arab world were also severely tested by the fact that France was the only major Western power delivering armaments – including modern airplanes – to Israel. At Fredensborg, Paul Nitze warned of the Soviet “shift in interest to the Middle East as an immediate theatre of contest.” There was “a very definite weakening of the political forces favorable to the West in Syria, in"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Decolonization and the global Cold War 155 p articular, but probably throughout the Arab world.” Several European participants – including van Kleffens and Robens – expressed their con - cern about the pan-Arab rhetoric employed by Nasser. The Egyptian leader seemed determined to resurrect the Turkish Empire, but now under Cairo’s rule. The Norwegian shipping magnate Leif Høegh accurately predicted that it was of the “highest importance to study Suez control [because] the Egyptians [are] planning to really exploit it.” Meanwhile, everyone agreed that control of the Middle East was crucial because of the increased impor - tance of oil. Arthur Dean exaggerated only slightly when he said: “If [the] U.S.S.R. controls those oil fields [the] U.S.S.R. will control industrial life of t he world.” 43 While the United States was not (yet) dependent on oil from the region, Western Europe certainly was. Sir John Slessor argued therefore that Nasser should be told that he could not “interfere with oil.” The West should not permit the Suez Canal to be anything else than an international waterway. The key to success, he said, was a concerted Anglo-American policy for the region. As the discussion made clear, however, this was also precisely what had been missing in re - cent months. Maudling, for example, made a strong appeal to his American colleagues to stop Saudi Arabian mischief in the region, partially directed against the British position in the Gulf States. 44 The Americans replied that there was little they could do since there were no strings attached to the royalties the American oil company Aramco paid to the Saudis. Wilcox and Dean preferred to focus on a solution for the Is raeli-Arab conflict, making several suggestions for developing the region, for solving the refugee question, and for devising a plan for international control of the Israeli borders. Of course, they were right in arguing that much of the instability in the Middle East was caused by the Israeli-Arab conflict. The trouble was, however, that some of those directly involved had little incentive to improve the situation. As John Hope said: “Nasser knows that [the] only issue on which Arabs are united is hatred of Israel.” 45 Co nsequently, it was unlikely that Nasser would accept the American proposals. The problems in the Middle East and North Africa brought out into the open again the transatlantic and inner-European differences over decoloni - zation. On the whole, the United States favored a much more far-reaching and quicker transfer of power in the remaining colonial territories than the European colonial powers. The Bandung movement undoubtedly strength - ened existing American anti-colonial reflexes. 46 The basic Cold War in - terest to develop good relations with the Bandung powers was sometimes at cross-purpose with interests of European allies. One example of the problems this conflict of interests caused was the French anger over inter - national trade union support for Moroccan trade unions. As Omer Becu explained at Fredensborg, the French had imposed unacceptable conditions on Mo roccan trade unions, forcing them into the arms of the communists if international Western organizations did not step in. Confronted with this"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"156 Decolonization and the global Cold War c hoice, Becu and his colleagues had decided to help them. The French re - garded this as international interference in their internal affairs. In a paper written for the Fredensborg conference on American atti - tudes towards colonialism, Dean Rusk reminded the European participants that the American preference for self-determination and democracy was a deeply rooted political fact that could not be easily changed. This explained the readiness of the American people to support NATO, but it also meant a strong bias towards ending all remaining colonial relationships. The trouble was, Rusk wrote, that unfortunately, a broad tradition provides few guide-lines for the specific question of a quasi-colonial nature which now plague the foreign pol - icy agenda. Colonialism in the classic pattern is clearly on the way out, much of it already liquidated. Much more difficult are situations where (1) mixed populations have violently different views about the nature of the political settlement (2) over-riding strategic factors force ideological factors in a subordinate role (3) the controversy rages without regard to the wishes of the people involved or (4) independence promises an early assumption of power by communist elements. With respect to the “quasi-colonial” crises such as in Algeria, where the pop - ulation was split, Rusk continued, “there is little disposition in the United States to go out looking for trouble.” 47 Ironically, however, Am erican in - action gave the Soviet Union the opportunity to become the champion of liberty and national independence. And despite American reticence, the differences between the United States and many European countries were displayed for the entire world in the United Nations. 48 Rusk argued that there was no custom-made solution to these problems. Still, the British model was by far the most successful and should be adopted by others as well. Until that time, the only thing that could be done to re - duce inner-Western tension was to change UN rules in order to prevent fre - quent voting on these issues, which only exacerbated transatlantic tensions. Jo seph Johnson, who followed developments at the United Nations closely, agreed. More often than not, he argued, the West found itself in a minority position in the United Nations, making it advisable to avoid frequent votes on colonial issues. As president of the Rockefeller Foundation, Dean Rusk had made the un - derdeveloped countries of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East a Foundation priority. Earlier in 1956, he had been asked by John Foster Dulles to study the “colonial question” as well as the possibility of a “Bandung Co nference in reverse” – a meeting of pro-Western Asia-African leaders. Dulles hoped that such a meeting would slow the “racially conscious antipathy now de - veloping in non-white areas.” 49 However, discussions with London quickly showed that such a meeting would only highlight differences with other Eu ropean allies, and the plan was abandoned. 50 The Fredensborg conference"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Decolonization and the global Cold War 157 c ould only confirm this difficult state of affairs. Despite attempts to forge a common Western response to the challenges of the new Soviet tactics and the post-Bandung emergence of Third World independence, there was no denying that the Atlantic alliance was deeply divided. The Suez crisis On July 26, 1956, Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal in response to the sudden Anglo-American decision not to fund the Egyptian Aswan Dam. 51 British Prime Minister Anthony Eden and French Premier Guy Mollet were furious and demanded swift action against Egypt. The Eisenhower Ad ministration, however, preferred to play for time in reaction to Nasser’s affront. Eisenhower and Dulles thought that there was no legal basis for an armed intervention and were concerned about American public opinion. Moreover, armed intervention would lead to a major anti-Western backlash in the region and throughout the Third World, as well as open the door to Soviet intervention. 52 The problem was that the French and British governments felt they could not ‘play it long’ as Dulles wanted them to. 53 Eden told Eisenhower that several moderate regimes in the region were in danger of falling victim to Na sserite rebellions. Nasser’s prestige increased every day he persisted in defying the entire West all by himself. A scenario in which Nasser, under Soviet tutelage, controlled the oil supplies of Western Europe was unaccept - able. Mollet fully agreed with Eden’s analysis and was additionally motivated to bring down the Egyptian leader in order to stop support for the Algerian rebellion and halt Nasser’s aggressive anti-Israeli policies. In Oc tober 1956, Foreign Minister Pineau began saying publicly that he was unable to follow the State Department line. 54 Dulles, for his part, announced on October 2 that with respect to colonial problems the United States had a “special role to play” and could not identify its policies fully with the “so-called colonial powers.” 55 When in October all attempts orchestrated by Dulles to reach a nego - tiated compromise seemed only to have won Nasser time, the British and French governments – in a secret agreement with the Israelis – decided to force a military intervention. The Israeli army would launch a preemptive attack against Egypt, thereby giving the French and the British a pretext for an armed intervention to safeguard the Suez Canal. Washington was not told of the plan. When the French and the British indeed intervened militarily in early November, Eisenhower and Dulles were furious. Not only did they feel deceived, they deeply regretted that the Franco-British action took place at the same time that in Hungary an anti-communist revolt was being crushed by Soviet tanks – not to mention the fact that the American presidential elections were only days away. The Eisenhower Administration therefore supported a UN resolution – also supported by the Soviet Union – calling for an immediate cease-fire"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"158 Decolonization and the global Cold War i n Egypt, only to be vetoed by the French and the British – the first veto by the United Kingdom since the founding of the United Nations. 56 In the following days, President Eisenhower pressured the British to call off the in- vasion of Egypt by denying much-needed financial support to stabilize the precarious position of the pound. Bulganin and Khrushchev, meanwhile, threatened Paris and London with a nuclear response to the Suez crisis. In face of the unexpectedly strong American reaction, the British felt they had to call off the military action on November 6. 57 The French could do little but follow suit. The Franco-British decision for action without consulting or notifying the Americans was based on a complex mixture of perceptions and cir - cumstances. For one, Washington was in the midst of a presidential elec - tion and no quick action could be expected from the United States, even if the Ei senhower Administration had been in full agreement with the An glo-French battle plan. But, such tactical concerns aside, the French and British governments had reached the conclusion that the Eisenhower government – and the State Department in particular – was fundamentally unwilling to seriously consider European concerns. The whole sequence of diplomatic action taken by Dulles, culminating in the Suez Canal Users’ Association (SCUA), seemed designed to thwart Anglo-French attempts to back their diplomacy by the threat of force. Several times, the secretary of state promised to maintain a tough stand against Nasser – or so the British and the French thought – only to back down in the face of strong opposition from Nasser. Retinger had met with Premier Mollet in early August and offered to travel to the United States in order to test the waters for joint action against Nasser. Mollet’s chef de cabinet Émile Noël noted that such a mission, al - though unlikely to succeed, might be useful to educate US opinion on the Suez issue. In the end, Retinger decided not to engage in another adventure as an informal diplomat. He told Mollet that any private initiative would be insufficient to bring around American opinion; only official diplomatic action could do so. Retinger argued that the Americans should be asked for a military contribution in case of conflict with Egypt. 58 By mid-October, Mollet personally thought that it was useless to wait for the Americans. 59 Ironically, his Bilderberg experiences may have strengthened this conviction. There could have been little doubt in his mind that the American anti-colonial tradition was powerful and deeply rooted. When asked after the Suez crisis about the deliberate deception of Wa shington, Mollet replied: “We did not tell President Eisenhower about the Fr anco-British invasion, because if we had, the U.S. would have insisted on our stopping.” 60 As Nitze told Dean Acheson later: From what Guy Mollet, reported by George Ball, says and from what Douglas Dillon [the American Ambassador in Paris] says, it seems to me clear that the French, from the beginning, intended to use the Canal"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Decolonization and the global Cold War 159 U sers Association as an excuse for the eventual use of force and that Dulles backed away from it because Dillon accurately reported to him Mollet’s intentions. [...] The French were under no illusions as to our probable opposition and were shocked at the British lack of courage in not proceeding in the face of an opposition which both they and the British knew they would have to expect. Our opposition was not in pur - suit of virtue but was a judgment of expediency covered by a claim of virtue. 61 More generally – and this is often neglected in the literature – the Suez crisis took place against the backdrop of a much broader crisis in NATO. The breakdown in relations between France and Great Britain on the one hand and the United States on the other did not arrive completely out of the blue. As we have seen, both the NATO summit in early May and the Fredensborg meeting revealed a fundamental lack of agreement on how to react to the new Soviet tactics in the post-Bandung underdeveloped world. The Bilderberg conference on St. Simons Island, Georgia (February 15 –17 , 1957) was the first to take place on American soil. Initial worries that a conference in the United States would draw too much unwanted press interested had been addressed in part by choosing a remote location. 62 The agenda consisted of four points: (1) a review of events since the Fredensborg conference, (2) “nationalism and neutralism as disruptive factors inside the Western Alliance,” (3) the Middle East, and (4) the policy of the Alliance towards Eastern Europe. Not surprisingly, the Suez crisis dominated much of the meeting. The American delegation at St. Simons Island was larger than normal, including Senator William Fulbright, the ranking Democratic member on the Foreign Affairs Committee; Senator Alexander Wiley, a Republican and former chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee; and congress - men John Vorys and Brooks Hays. Bilderberg regulars Ball, Cisler, Hauge, Heinz, McGhee, Murphy, Nebolsine, Nitze, and Rusk were present, as were Bi lderberg newcomers Eugene Black, Assistant Secretary of State Rob ert Bowie, McGeorge Bundy, former Governor of New York Thomas E. Dewey, and Henry Kissinger. The European group was plagued by last-minute cancellations. Amintore Fanfani and Giovanni Malagodi were prevented from coming because of the unstable political situation in Italy. Baumgartner, the President of the French National Bank, did not dare to leave his country because of the fi - nancial crisis in France. Jean Monnet, who had been invited for the first time, decided at the last minute that he had to stay in France to monitor the final stages of the Rome Treaties negotiations. Robert Marjolin had al - ready canceled for the same reason. This left France represented only by the Se cretary-General of the SFIO, Pierre Commin, and by Antoine Pinay. 63 Great Britain had a stronger delegation, including David Astor, editor of The Observer ; Denis Healey; Air Chief Marshal Sir William Elliot, the"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"160 Decolonization and the global Cold War C hairman of the Council of the Royal Institute of International Affairs; and J. L. S. Steel, Director of Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd. After a telephone call from Prince Bernhard, Prime Minister Harold Macmillan had also asked the Lord Chancellor, Lord Kilmuir, to take part in the meet - ing. As Macmillan told Kilmuir: “I gather that the Foreign Secretary thinks that the Bilderberg Group can do quite a lot of valuable work and I won - der therefore whether you yourself could possibly consider attending on our b e h a l f.” 64 “Valuable work” in this case meant repairing Anglo-American relations, by far the most important foreign policy aim for the new prime m in ister. 65 The Foreign Office brief prepared for Lord Kilmuir left no doubt on this matter: Our aim in discussing Anglo-American relations in any of its aspects should be so far as possible to demonstrate the strength of the connex - ion [sic] as it still stands to-day rather than to dwell unduly on the obvi- ous defects in American policy, as shown up in the Suez crisis. 66 The Foreign Office argued that Eisenhower and Dulles had been more concerned with the “position of the West in the United Nations” than with French and British vital interests in the Middle East. Even though the region did not belong to the straightforward colonial problems, “[...] it is clear, if only from unguarded statements which Mr. Dulles has let drop from time to time, that anti-colonial prejudices have coloured his thinking, certainly about the Suez Canal and probably the whole Middle East.” 67 The British, for their part, were happy to leave intact the widespread impression that the United States had been responsible for setting off the Suez crisis by unilat - erally withdrawing the Anglo-American offer to finance the Aswan Dam. Commenting on a paper the French political columnist Raymond Aron had written for the St. Simons Island conference, the Foreign Office stated: We should not play up Monsieur Aron’s point [...] about United States withdrawal of the offer of credits for the Aswan dam. Her Majesty’s Government probably share at least equal responsibility for the change of attitude, but, perhaps fortunately, this fact is not apparently known outside official circles. 68 Raymond Aron, one of France’s most respected sociologists and politi - cal observers, contributed a highly critical analysis of American policy in the Middle East and the larger impact of the Suez crisis on the alliance. Un fortunately – both for the Bilderberg participants and for later hi storians – Aron did not make it to Georgia. His plane broke down twice, leaving him stranded in Ireland. 69 Still, his paper was discussed at length and provoked several angry American responses. Although Aron had opposed the Anglo-French intervention – and almost broke with his newspaper Le Figaro over the crisis – he thought that much"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Decolonization and the global Cold War 161 o f the current anti-American sentiment in France and Great Britain was understandable. In his view, the record of the Eisenhower Administration in the Middle East was appalling: American policy has provoked or encouraged decisions which have aggravated tension; it has systematically run away from the responsi - bilities arising from the circumstances; it is only gradually finding out that it cannot look on at the rout of European power and prestige and disassociate itself from the consequences. First, the United States pressured Great Britain to evacuate the Canal Zone. Washington then decided to cooperate with Colonel Nasser, despite the latter’s virulent nationalism and his arms deal with the Soviets. Next, the Aswan Dam offer was suddenly withdrawn, causing Nasser to restore his prestige by nationalizing the Suez Canal, “[A]nd now everything goes on as if American diplomacy saw in this nationalization merely an episode in the anti-colonialist struggle, and had no other objective than to incite British and French passivity.” 70 Even if one disagreed with the Anglo-French intervention, the Ame rican re - action, Aron wrote, only made matters worse. On the day of the An glo-French ultimatum to Egypt, October 30, Aron recalled that Ei senhower had declared: “There must not be one law for the enemy and one for our friends, one law for the strong and one for the weak.” Two days later Soviet tanks rolled into Bud apest. “The United States,” Aron wrote, taking command of the Afro-Asian coalition in order not to follow it, showed itself more severe toward its allies (France and Great Britain) than toward its enemy (the Soviet Union), toward the weak (France and Great Britain) than toward the strong (the Soviet Union). The fact that Washington, according to Aron, had seriously considered inter - vening militarily against France and Britain could not easily be forgotten. 71 What were the consequences for the Atlantic alliance? “It is not the first time,” Aron wrote, “that the leader of a coalition shows itself to be indiffer - ent to the vital interests of its allies. But this indifference inevitably turns the allies into satellites.” Aron argued that in response Europe should become responsible again for its own defense, in both the military and economic sense. Europe’s relations with the rest of the world – and its dependence on trade and raw materials from outside – demanded a united Europe greater than the Six: “[...] a unity of all the countries of the Old World, right up to the Russian frontier.” 72 As it was, Aron’s paper served a useful purpose for those participants at St. Simons Island who were more concerned with restoring transatlantic relations than with assigning blame for the Suez disaster. It gave the Am erican partici - pants an opportunity to deny the more extreme accusations. Robert Mu r phy,"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"162 Decolonization and the global Cold War for one, “solemnly denied” Aron’s accusation regarding Am erican plans to use force against its own allies and disputed the Fre nchman’s history of Am erican involvement in the Middle East. Eugene Black also attacked Aron’s version of events concerning the financing of the Aswan Dam. 73 The Canadian Minister of Health, Paul Martin, defended the Eisenhower Ad ministration by saying that any other reaction to the Anglo-French ulti - matum might have led to general war involving the Soviet Union. 74 Paul Hoffman also supported Eisenhower’s new line, saying that the pres - ident’s declaration that “the United States could neither ignore nor condone aggression regardless of its source” had made it possible for the first time to mobilize world opinion against the Soviet Union. Until the Suez crisis, Moscow had been remarkably successful in the Afro-Asian world with its peace propaganda. As a result of Hungary and the American role in the Suez crisis, “the intangible asset of moral force could now be brought to bear on the Western side.” 75 In response, several European speakers warned that the West had little to gain from building up world opinion through the United Nations as long as the communists were able to dominate the General Assembly in cooperation with the Afro-Asian bloc. The Norwegian Socialist Jens Christian Hauge even argued that President Eisenhower had established a dangerous precedent by making intervention by force depend - ent on world opinion. 76 George Kennan was the only one on the American side who pronounced himself in full agreement with Aron’s paper. On November 3, 1956, Kennan had already published a letter highly critical of the Eisenhower Administra - tion in the Washington Post and Times Herald . “The British and French have fumbled – certainly,” Kennan wrote, we, too, have fumbled on certain past occasions; and our friends did not turn against us. Moreover, we bear a heavy measure of responsibility for the desperation that has driven the French and the British govern - ments to this ill-conceived and pathetic action. 77 On the European side, many felt obliged to soften the impact of Aron’s paper. Commin argued that Aron exaggerated the strength of anti- Am ericanism in France and emphasized the need for a common policy in the Middle East since the communists were experts in exploiting nationalist movements. 78 Astor, Healey and Air Marshal Elliot all indicated their disagreement with the Anglo-French Suez expedition. In Healey’s words: “We lit our - selves the forest fire we set out to extinguish in the Middle East.” Astor, whose Ob server had been highly critical of the Eden Government, pointed to the complex situation in the United Kingdom: “There isn’t one British attitude on the Suez crisis. It is not a row between all of Britain and all of America. The basic interests of the U.S. and the U.K. are similar.” 79 Not long after the St. Si mons conference, Quaroni told Prince Bernhard that the Fr anco-British intervention reflected colonialist attitudes that were no"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Decolonization and the global Cold War 163 l onger acceptable: “Ancient tradition has made us Europeans consider that there is a difference between killing Hungarians and killing Egyptians. The new conscience of the world does not admit this difference.” 80 The participants who defended the Anglo-French Suez strategy could be counted on one hand. Lord Kilmuir made the rather disingenuous claim that it succeeded in finally bringing about effective UN action, and Ma jor-General Colin Gubbins argued that Great Britain had been com - pletely surprised by the American attitude. This view, popular in British conservative circles, could not stand up to closer scrutiny. Nitze was correct in saying that the British government could not have had any doubt about the fact that Washington considered the use of force unwise. 81 One of the main accomplishments of the St. Simons Island discussions was to address the many transatlantic misperceptions – starting with Aron’s various accusations, to Gubbins’ claim that Great Britain had been sud - denly and unfairly abandoned by Washington. The British Foreign Office noted that Aron’s strong criticism could also have an “educative effect” on US readers in showing the Americans that they must not take too much for granted in their relationship with Europe and that if they are to retain the full support of Europe in the cold war [...] they must take more account of Europe’s special needs, vital interests and individual susceptibilities. As the St. Simons Island report noted: “Many cases were quoted of distor - tion and falsification of the facts, indeed many participants were alarmed to find how far this distortion had gone, and how high it had penetrated into the top levels of public opinion.” 82 With most of these misunderstandings cleared away – “out of our systems,” as Rusk put it in a letter to Retinger – Western divisions during the Suez crisis seemed to concern methods rather than goals. 83 In private, American participants even expressed regret that the Anglo-French action had not been successful in getting rid of Nasser. 84 Their regret may have been caused in part by an unintended consequence of Suez: the failure of the Anglo-French intervention forced Washington to assume a leading role in the Middle East. The British had been tradi - tionally responsible for keeping the Russians out of the region, but obvi - ously they no longer could do so. The resulting vacuum could either be filled by the Soviet Union or the United States. Presented with this dilemma, Wa shington’s choice was obvious. The Eisenhower Doctrine, made public in January 1957, was the result. It promised military assistance to any state in the Mi ddle East threatened by communism. At the same time it instituted a large program of economic assistance. George McGhee argued that if the Eisenhower Doctrine had only existed in 1955 the Suez crisis would never have occurred. At St. Simons Island, Senator Fulbright came under fire for his early op - position to the Eisenhower Doctrine. He tried to defend his opposition by"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"16 4 Decolonization and the global Cold War r eferring to the constitutional difficulty of pre-delegating the use of force to the president. But as the Canadian Ambassador to the United States, Ar nold D. P. Heeney, said, the reluctance to go along was “disturbing” in view of the quick passage of a similar resolution during the Quemoy and Matsu crisis in 1954–1955. Ironically, the obvious Cold War rationale of the Eisenhower Doctrine hurt the United States’ reputation – so carefully protected during the Suez crisis – among the Bandung powers. 85 Moreover, some participants remained openly pessimistic about the chance for economic development in the Middle East. Marcus Wallenberg, a prominent Swedish banker, warned that “the problems of [the Middle East] may well be with us for a long time. It would seem part of wisdom to increase Western flexibility with respect to energy supply.” 86 Eugene Black called the Middle East, the “most difficult” region the World Bank had to deal with. 87 Many governments in the region lacked experience, were corrupt, and were suspicious of the West. Moreover, relations between the oil-possessing countries and those who did not were strained. The only hopeful news was that the Arab League had asked the World Bank to assist in the creation of an Arab Development Bank. This might be an effective means for transferring oil wealth to the poorer countries, and Black appealed to the Bilderberg participants to support this initiative. As a result, several Bilderbergers, including Fritz Berg, Victor Cavendish- Be ntinck, Hakon Christiansen, Leif Høegh, George Nebolsine, Paul Ri jkens, David Rockefeller, and Otto Wolff agreed to set up a committee to study the possibilities for an Arab investment bank. In October–November 1957, a delegation of the Study Group for the Near and Middle East led by Paul Rijkens traveled to the region to win Arab support for the initiative. Eugene Black also helped organize meetings with Arab representatives at the World Bank. 88 An international consortium of banks and companies underwrote a starting capital for the Middle East Development Corporation (MIDEC), yet it is unclear how successful MIDEC was in the midst of continued instability in much of the region. 89 The strong Bilderberg consensus on the importance of economic devel - opment and technical assistance, meanwhile, did find its way into official circles, if only because so many American Bilderbergers – including Black, Hauge, Hoffman, Rockefeller, and Rusk – were deeply involved in these is - sues. One result was President Eisenhower’s address to the United Nations in August 1958 calling for “an Arab development institution.” The speech had been drafted by none other than C. D. Jackson. Paul Hoffman, mean - while, published a long article setting out his views on a Marshall Plan for the underdeveloped world in the New York Times on the last day of the St. Simons Island conference. 90 One year later, he was instrumental in creat - ing and directing the United Nations Special Fund for development, a pre - cursor of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). 91 At the 1959 Bilderberg conference in Ye ş ilköy, Turkey, Hoffman shared his experiences and lobbied for the Special Fund. 92"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Decolonization and the global Cold War 165 T he Dutch Ambassador in Washington, J. H. van Roijen, who was pres - ent at St. Simons Island, told Prince Bernhard that the overall effect of the meeting had been good. Several American participants had expressed their keen satisfaction with the discussions and van Roijen felt that a bet - ter understanding for mutual “complaints and grievances” was impor - tant. 93 After the breakdown in transatlantic communications during the Suez crisis, it obviously was a relief to be talking again. Lord Kilmuir told Macmillan that [a]s the discussion went on the climate changed from ‘how could you do this to your old friends?’ to a more reasoned approach that, in every healthy grouping of peoples and states, there must be differences as to the methods to achieve common aims, [...] and that nothing had hap - pened which would prevent full co-operation in the future. 94 The Polish-born economist Michael A. Heilperin was even more optimistic, telling Prince Bernhard: I was impressed by the extent to which the membership of this group, whether Europeans or Americans, whether of right- or left-wing pre - dilections, speaks the same language. They are a fair sample of leader - ship in some future “Atlantic Community” – indeed they make one feel optimistic (or: make me feel optimistic) about the chances of achieving a community and common-purpose spirit within the Atlantic world. There was a frank and outspoken exchange of views, no punches were pulled, yet there was no recrimination, no antagonisms, and, I think, a real wish to find a common ground, or, failing that, a better understand - ing of the divergent points of view. 95 Still, the general goodwill displayed at St. Simons Island could not hide the fact that important differences remained. There could be little doubt that despite the Eisenhower Doctrine, Washington would continue to follow a more anti-colonial line than some European countries wished to see. Given the Eisenhower Administration’s wholehearted embrace of the United Na tions, the General Assembly in New York was bound to witness more inner- We stern conflicts. In addition, American leadership within the alli - ance had taken a hit. As Terkelsen wrote in a report on the conference: It appeared, not least in private conversations, that the mistrust in Foster Dulles, which is widely encountered in Europe, is not alien to the Americans, who considered him a capable and supple advocate of any cause, but feel he lacks the broader vision that would enable him to create a coherent policy, with the result that America to some extent fails to live up to the task of being the leading power in the Western alliance. 96"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"166 Decolonization and the global Cold War W ith respect to the long-term impact of the Suez crisis, historians such as Geir Lundestad and Irwin Wall have argued that Great Britain and France learned diametrically opposed lessons. London, so the argument goes, de - cided never again to engage in military adventures without coordination with the United States. Paris, on the other hand, would never again trust the ‘Anglo-Saxons’ to defend French interests. The Bilderberg conference at St. Simons Island suggests, however, that we should be careful with such a far-reaching conclusion since it transposes Gaullist attitudes of the French Fifth Republic onto the Fourth Republic. The Mollet government, in fact, was remarkably fast in moving on after the Suez crisis. Premier Mollet not only sent his close associate Pierre Com min to the St. Simons Island conference with a very conciliatory message, argu - ing strongly for restoring the Atlantic alliance; he also traveled to the United States later in February 1957 with a similar aim, using language reminiscent of the Bilderberg meetings. As he put it upon arriving in New York, I intend to state emphatically to President Eisenhower [...] that our country which has been for nearly two centuries your faithful ally does not intend, rain or shine, to change its mind nor its heart. We are al - ways in the same boat and our common ideals command us to stick together. 97 Both the informal and the formal alliance, in other words, focused their en - ergies on repairing the damage done to the alliance. This also meant dealing with the difficult question of NATO’s nuclear defense. As we have seen, the Suez crisis did give a strong boost to European inte - gration, but the concept of a more independent Europe was not necessarily in conflict with improved transatlantic relations. 98 Quite the opposite: in the view of leaders such as Mollet and Adenauer, a more united Europe would continue to work closely with the United States in a more equal partner - ship, in spite of all the differences over decolonization or nuclear strategy. Moreover, they repeatedly argued that the United States would lose interest in Europe if they did not succeed in furthering integration. At St. Simons Island, Rusk made the same point: if only Europe could be more responsi - ble for its own defense, he said, many of the alliance’s problems would be solved. 99 President Eisenhower, for his part, continued to support the plans for European economic integration, telling Mollet and Pineau: “the day this common market became a reality would be one of the finest days in the his - tory of the free world, perhaps even more so than winning the war.” 100 Notes 1 Westad, The Global Cold War . 2 Ba rbizon Transcript, English III, 46–47, Box 4, Bilderberg Archives, NANL. 3 Se e Acharya, East of India . 4 On t his point, see Gaddis, The Cold War , Chapter 4."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"Decolonization and the global Cold War 167 5 Barbizon Transcript, French VI, 23–24, (my translation), Box 4, Bi lderberg Ar chives, NANL.

According to Denis Healey, the Sputnik shock left the Bilderbergers (particularly the Americans) “flabbergasted,” and it was immediately clear that this was an important development for the nuclear defense of NATO. 1 Given both the overwhelming Soviet advantage in conventional military forces and the im - mense financial costs of keeping under arms the number of divisions nec - essary to defend Europe conventionally, NATO relied strongly on nuclear weapons for its defense. However, since the United States controlled the vast majority of the nuclear weapons assigned for this defense, the inevita - ble question arose whether the United States could be relied upon to defend Europe now that Soviet missiles were clearly able to reach the American mainland. In the resulting transatlantic debate over ‘massive retaliation’ and ‘flexi - ble response,’ the indirect influence of the Bilderberg Group becomes appar - ent. This chapter argues that the Bilderberg discussions on nuclear strategy, disarmament, and Soviet intentions served to disseminate information and expertise that was hard to get by, particularly for participants from the non-nuclear nations. The first part follows the informal alliance’s response to the Eisenhower Administration ’s New Look strategy, as high-ranking NATO officials used the Bilderberg meetings to persuade the transatlantic elite of the necessity of NATO’s nuclear turn. The second part shows how the Bilderberg conferences also provided an important forum for critics of the Eisenhower Administration’s strong reliance on nuclear weapons. One of these critics was the young foreign policy expert Henry Kissinger. The final part of this chapter examines how the criticism of massive retaliation slowly made its way through the networks and publications of the informal alliance and ended up influencing decision-makers, NATO officials, and politicians on both sides of the Atlantic - both in the form of alternative strategies and in the form of different proposals for the denuclearization or neutralization of Europe. 7 NATO, nuclear strategy, an d the Cold War"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"NATO, nuclear strategy, and the Cold War 173 The Eisenhower Administration’s New Look The NATO strategic doctrine set out in NATO document MC 48, which for the first time integrated the use of nuclear weapons, had been accepted at the December 1954 NATO Council meeting and reflected the strategic thinking of Eisenhower’s New Look. 2 The New Look promised a more ef - fective defense at a smaller cost by relying more on nuclear weapons for deterrence: more bang for the buck. To some extent, the policy change was a rationalization of political and economic realities within the alliance. 3 Ei senhower believed that the West was not capable of matching or even ap - proaching the Soviet conventional superiority without threatening its own way of life and economic health. He disagreed, therefore, with the efforts by the Truman Administration at the February 1952 Lisbon NATO summit to achieve a massive buildup of NATO forces. Eisenhower, at that time still SACEUR, was shocked by the resulting force goal of approximately 65 first- line divisions. He told his subordinates at NATO headquarters that the end of NATO was near since he was convinced that the agreed force levels could never be reached. 4 As a result, public confidence in NATO’s ability to defend Europe would decline, weakening NATO and strengthening neutralist and communist forces in Europe. When Eisenhower entered the White House, he was determined to cre - ate a more sustainable balance between military and economic needs, a strategy for the ‘long haul.’ 5 Eisenhower was convinced that nuclear weap - ons, becoming available in ever increasing numbers and sizes, could close the wide gap in conventional forces between NATO and the Warsaw Pact (which was founded in 1955). The ultimate goal of the New Look was to end the deployment of large numbers of American forces in Europe and to reach a situation in which the Europeans themselves would provide for local defense, reinforced by US air and naval power. In the short term, however, the redeployment of American forces was out of the question. The European military buildup was much slower than ex pected – mostly because of the long delay in getting a German con tribution – and any hint of an American pullback would have caused political upheaval in Europe. The dilemma of redeployment divided the Ei senhower Administration throughout the 1950s, with Admiral Arthur Radford of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) consistently arguing for a reduc - tion in force levels abroad and the State Department emphasizing the po - litical ramifications in Europe. Moreover, the right wing, isolationist and anti-European faction of the Republican Party always kept pressure on the Eisenhower Administration to ‘bring the boys back’ from Europe. Eisenhower picked his friend and favorite bridge partner General Al fred Gruenther as SACEUR to implement the New Look in NATO. Educating European publics about the new strategy was crucial to its eventual suc - cess and this probably explains why General Gruenther accepted the in - vitation to participate in the September 1955 Bilderberg conference in"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"174 NATO, nuclear strategy, and the Cold War G armisch-Partenkirchen. General Gruenther used the conference to ex - plain the thinking behind MC 48 at length, emphasizing two key arguments: first, that a forward defense required a German contribution of 12 divisions; second, that only with the use atomic weapons an all-out Soviet attack could be repelled. NATO’s reliance on nuclear weapons implied that the West should be willing to use these weapons first. In Gruenther’s words: “[...] let us be sure that we understand that we use atomic weapons whether the other side uses them or not.” 6 He acknowledged that this reliance on nuclear weapons cre - ated a whole range of psychological and political problems. Most impor - tantly, it enabled Moscow to take advantage of the public’s natural aversion against weapons of mass destruction and to score propaganda points with calls for nuclear disarmament. Gruenther warned that the Western public should be educated in this respect: It creates an entirely new situation for us if the atomic bomb be out - lawed, and we feel it represents a tremendous public opinion problem that people should recognise that what the North Atlantic Treaty Or - ganisation is trying to do is to prevent a war from taking place, and that the evil is not weapon A or B or C, but war itself. 7 This was an important point, going to the heart of President Eisenhower’s views on deterrence. 8 The crucial paradox was that only by being willing to plan for the unimaginable could one avoid it. By planning for nuclear war, NATO forced the Soviets to think twice about the possible consequences of aggression. President Eisenhower firmly believed that the Soviet leaders were responsive to the logic of deterrence, as long as they were convinced that the United States would respond to aggression against themselves or their allies – with nuclear arms if necessary. The threat of massive retali - ation, combined with an effective forward defense of the NATO territory, therefore more or less ruled out a war in Europe. The Eisenhower Administration’s declaratory policy on the New Look, however, was sometimes misleading. The first speech by Dulles on the sub - ject, on January 12, 1954, introduced the concept of massive retaliation and seemed to imply that the new strategy foresaw an atomic answer to any So viet aggression, no matter where and no matter how small. Su bsequent efforts to clear up this misunderstanding were not entirely successful. 9 In deed, at the Garmisch conference, Admiral Anthony Buzzard, one of Great Britain’s foremost strategic thinkers, claimed that the strategy amounted to threatening to blow the world to pieces for any aggression beyond the power of our small conventional forces, for that is what our present pol - icy undoubtedly amounts to so long as we do not establish any distinc - tion between the tactical and strategic uses of nuclear weapons. 10"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"NATO, nuclear strategy, and the Cold War 175 Yet as General Gruenther tried to explain, the deterrence of Soviet aggres - sion in Europe rested not solely on thermonuclear weapons. Those weap - ons were only part of a much broader strategy. In fact, MC 48 stated that Soviet aggression against NATO territory should be deterred not only by the threat of massive retaliation, but also by convincing the Soviets that “[t] hey cannot quickly overrun Europe.” 11 The purpose of the German military build-up and the deployment of tactical atomic weapons to NATO forces, in other words, was to deny the Soviets the possibility of a quick military v ic tor y. 12 Thus a forward defense with strong shield forces, reinforced by tactical atomic weapons, was seen at SHAPE, NATO’s headquarters, as contributing to a credible deterrence. Gruenther was remarkably candid about these issues. In reply to a question from the Swedish journalist Herbert Tingsten, he left no doubt that a war directly involving NATO and the Soviet Union would quickly turn into total war. All bets would be off: “[...] the general concept is, if a war does occur you will use whatever force is necessary to win that war.” The aim would be to destroy Soviet nuclear forces as quickly as possible. On one of his maps, Gruenther pointed out the airfields with tactical Soviet forces that would have a high priority for NATO tactical aircraft. But he also indicated that, although it was not his direct responsibility, in his opinion the major part of the American counterattack would tar - get Soviet strategic forces. Using his map, Gruenther explained what he meant: the keystone of the Soviet attack, namely the North American Soviet potential, will come from much deeper, from here , here and here – and not from here . Should you go after those fields or not? My guess is that they [Strategic Air Command, TWG] will go after those fields before you can count to ten, and if they can before you count to five, they will go after those fields before you count to five. They would be the ones that ran the only chance of knocking out North American war poten - tial, and those would be on a very, very high priority. 13 This was a terrifying scenario and Tingsten wanted to make sure he had understood Gruenther correctly. “May I just add,” Tingsten said, that there is a certain line of thinking, both in the United States and in Europe, that it would be possible perhaps to have a great war without using this type of bombing against production centres and so on. But as far as I understand you now, we must think of a new world war as a so-called “total” war. Both sides will use all their weapons from the beginning and will not wait until the other begins, so to speak, from the Western side? “Yes,” Gruenther replied, “that is what I think.” 14"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"176 NATO, nuclear strategy, and the Cold War I t was on this point that Admiral Buzzard put up the most forceful chal - lenge to the new NATO strategy. 15 “Morally, massive retaliation,” Buzzard said, is [...] far too drastic to be justified any longer than is absolutely neces - sary. Politically, as Russia’s strategic air power grows it becomes increas - ingly akin to bluff, as a deterrent against any aggression between all-out attack and a very minor one, leaving much room between these two for communist exploitation and misunderstanding and miscalculation. 16 Massive retaliation should be modified as quickly as possible to a strategy of “graduated deterrence,” by which Buzzard meant a recognized difference between tactical and strategic nuclear weapons. Once NATO was confident it could repel a Soviet attack with ground forces equipped with tactical nu - clear weapons, the West should unilaterally declare it would not be the first to use the H-bomb. Following that, a declaration should be made that the West would not be the first to attack centers of population. As Buzzard put it: “I maintain that graduated deterrence will assist both in nipping a small war in the bud and in preventing the spreading quite so rapidly into an all- out wa r.” 17 Denis Healey and Paul Nitze, both keenly interested in nuclear strategy, were intrigued by Buzzard’s ideas. They supported his plea for the minimum use of force necessary in reaction to local or limited aggression. Yet they did not agree with his suggestion to announce a no-first-strike policy with regard to thermonuclear weapons. As Nitze put it, he did not see any advan - tage in “a declaration which ties your hands behind your back.” Most other speakers at Garmisch expressed similar doubts about such a declaration. The British Secretary of State for Commonwealth Affairs, John Fos ter, stated that ever since 1945 he was convinced that Moscow would avoid a direct confrontation with the West, but this was the case solely “[...] because we have been prepared to use our weapons to the full.” Foster continued: I also believe that, far from quieting public opinion in the world, if we announce to the world that we would not ourselves use all our weap - ons public opinion would be disquieted, and not quieted, and that our proper policy is to say to the Russians that we will use all our weapons in what in my definition I call a ‘total’ war – one in which Russia was directly engaged – and in one where Russia was not directly engaged we should pursue what I call the ‘Korean policy.’ 18 Several participants pointed out that Admiral Buzzard misinterpreted NATO strategy. Indeed, Buzzard seemed to share in the confusion that had existed ever since Dulles’ massive retaliation speech in January 1954. Nitze remarked that, despite some of the rhetoric of massive retaliation, a policy of “graduated retaliation” was actually in effect. “Certainly the fact that we"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"NATO, nuclear strategy, and the Cold War 177 l imited the Korean War to Korea is an instance of this. Certainly it is not to the interest of the West to have a general atomic war.” 19 Joseph Johnson similarly accused Buzzard of posing “somewhat of a false issue.” 20 Part of the problem was that Buzzard made no distinction between the areas where American and NATO power was committed and ‘grey areas,’ such as parts of Asia. Buzzard also assumed that the strategy of massive retaliation did not distinguish between different levels of aggression. When Denis Healey pointed out that once “equivalence” in nuclear capabilities was reached, massive retaliation was not a credible response to a “small probe or nibble,” General Gruenther hastened to clarify his position: I was not talking about a probing attack when I said we were going to use atomic weapons to repel an act of Soviet aggression. [...] I am talk - ing about all-out aggression; the brush-fire war, Korea, Indo-China, I am not discussing. 21 Of course, Gruenther’s response now raised the question what type and what level of aggression amounted to “all-out aggression.” Gruenther was quick to acknowledge this problem: “What constitutes an all-out attack I recognize may again back me in a corner very quickly – I cannot tell you what are the gradations.” 22 He also said that the difference between tactical and strategic use of nuclear weapons was difficult to establish. What about an atomic bomb on a city of 75,000 with a sizeable army base within its borders? “[I]s that a tactical use of the atomic bomb or is that a strategic use of the atomic bomb? I do not know.” As far as SHAPE planning was con - cerned, centers of population were not used as targets “not only for human - itarian reasons but also because we do not have the bombs to waste [...].” 23 If General Gruenther did not spell out what amounted to an all-out attack in Europe, he did emphasize that in the end it was not up to the military to decide on an appropriate reaction. This was a decision that should be made by the political leadership, taking into account the political, economic, and psychological consequences. 24 It was impossible to decide beforehand how to react to aggression short of all-out war. In the final analysis, it was a deci - sion for the American Commander in Chief, to be taken when the situation arose. With respect to public opinion, the Eisenhower Administration’s New Look posed serious difficulties. Healey warned that NATO strategy seemed to amount to “swopping the bombs bang off.” “The fact that we appear to rely wholly and solely on the H-Bomb,” he said, “makes us appear in a very odd light to many people in Europe, not to speak of Asia.” He added that, so long as any one of the members of the alliance has control of the weapon on which the security of the whole depends it is very difficult to persuade the other countries of the need to make sacrifices for conven - tional defence [...]."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"178 NATO, nuclear strategy, and the Cold War R epublican Senator Ralph Flanders also welcomed Buzzard’s efforts to come up with an alternative to massive retaliation. “Disarmament is still in the air in America,” Flanders argued, and that aspiration will still have to be reckoned with. Now, the state of public opinion in my country is thousands of miles away from the general conclusion which has been stated as coming out of this meet - ing. It is still further away, I believe, if General Gruenther will forgive me, from the vague and disturbing reliance placed on atomic weapons which I gather from his remarks. Joseph Johnson, another keen observer of American public opinion, added: “I do not think there is a possibility of getting agreement on general disar - mament, and I think there is a danger [...] that there may be some disarma - ment on our side unilaterally if we do not watch out [...].” 25 After the Garmisch conference, Retinger told General Gruenther that, in his opinion, no more than 10% of the participants had subscribed to Ad miral Buzzard’s theory. 26 Even Buzzard himself abandoned his call for a no-first-strike declaration after the criticism at the Garmisch conference. 27 Still, the Garmisch discussion highlighted the political sensitivity of nuclear strategy and set the stage for the debate over massive retaliation versus flexi- ble response. In an article for the January 1956 issue of Foreign Affairs , writ - ten in reaction to the Garmisch discussions, Nitze fired one of the first shots in this battle, arguing that instead of relying on nuclear weapons, the West should be able to react to local aggression with conventional forces. 28 “We should endeavor,” he wrote, “to meet aggression and restore the situation without the use of atomic weapons wherever this is possible.” 29 The nuclearization of NATO had been designed to increase the alliance’s trust in a credible defense of Europe without destroying the economic and political basis of the West. The Garmisch discussions showed, however, that the Eisenhower Administration’s nuclear rhetoric might have exactly the opposite effect. As early as December 1954, during a steering committee meeting in Paris, Quaroni had pointed to the political dangers of MC 48: “When that document [...] becomes public,” he predicted, “you will have a tremendous flare-up here in Europe of neutralism.” 30 The Garmisch discussions on NATO’s nuclear strategy did allow the European Bilderberg participants to familiarize themselves with strategic thinking on the other side of the Atlantic – where, after all, most techni - cal knowledge and experience concerning nuclear weapons resided – and within NATO. Conversely, the American participants who participated in the Bilderberg conferences developed a greater sensitivity for the political and psychological consequences of nuclear strategy in Europe. In addition, personal contacts established at the Bilderberg meetings turned out to be consequential for the transatlantic strategy debates. Nitze, Healey, and Admiral Buzzard remained in touch after the Garmisch"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"NATO, nuclear strategy, and the Cold War 179 c onference and regularly exchanged articles. 31 Buzzard also kept SHAPE informed about his thinking, which had undergone a significant change as a result of the Garmisch discussions. In January 1957, moreover, Healey, Buzzard, and a few like-minded people organized a conference in Brighton on nuclear strategy and the problem of limited war. As a result of the conference, Healey and Buzzard decided to create a new think tank to raise the level of strategic debate within the UK, and Healey relied on his Bilderberg contacts to secure funding for the Institute for Strategic Studies. 32 During the 1957 Fiuggi conference, Healey asked Shepard Stone, the director of the Ford Foundation’s European program, for financial support for the continuation of the Brighton conference effort and was able to secure a substantial first grant. 33 Over time, the Institute (later renamed the International Institute for Strategic Studies) became an important part of the informal alliance. Debating massive retaliation In the first half of 1956, ‘peaceful co-existence’ and the apparent relaxation of East-West tensions put increasing pressures on defense budgets in most NATO countries. Even to those who did not necessarily believe in a genuine Soviet wish for co-existence, the Cold War seemed to have reached a new phase in which socioeconomic competition had a larger part to play. The British government therefore decided to make drastic cuts in conventional forces and to concentrate on modernizing the British nuclear deterrent. Not only would this save money; the UK would also maintain a ‘special relationship’ in nuclear matters with the United States and protect its ‘big power’ status. 34 The conservative government justified this move with the ‘trip-wire’ strategy, which boiled down to the argument that a small number of conventional forces in Europe sufficed as a trip-wire to set off the West’s nuclear response to a Soviet attack in Europe. While rumors about the British plans were making the rounds, The New York Times reported that Admiral Radford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called for an 800,000-man cutback in American conventional forces. 35 Radford argued that the introduction of tactical nuclear weapons would make up for the loss in manpower. The State Department quickly de - nied that any such plan was under consideration, but the damage was done: both the Radford plan and the British trip-wire strategy implied a major de - parture from the kind of forward defense that General Gruenther – and his successor as SACEUR, General Lauris Norstad – advocated. 36 This raised fears in Europe – particularly in Bonn – that the United States and Great Britain would pull out completely from continental Europe and rely on a peripheral strategy, known in the United States as “fortress America.” 37 And then the Suez-Hungary double crisis intervened. The crisis further undermined the willingness in Europe to rely on the American nuclear guarantee. Raymond Aron was not the only one who concluded after Suez"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"180 NATO, nuclear strategy, and the Cold War t hat Europe needed its own nuclear deterrent. Even Guy Mollet, who had long opposed the French nuclear program, now agreed that France should accelerate its own nuclear program – although the final decision to build a force de f rappe wasn’t made until later. 38 In addition, the specter of a Hungary- st yle rebellion escalating into a broader conflict raised the ques - tion of whether NATO was prepared to deal with the issue of limited war. Healey, somewhat provocatively, called the Suez-Hungary crisis “the revolt of the satellites – on both sides of the Iron Curtain. It saw nationalism re- es tablished as the dominant force in world politics, disrupting alliances and confusing the simple bipolarity of the Cold War Decade.” 39 As a result of the Suez crisis, the questions of nuclear control and limited war featured prominently at the NATO summits in December 1956 in Paris and in May 1957 in Bonn. During the first of the two summits, the NATO Council agreed to a Political Directive to clarify NATO’s nuclear threshold. This reflected the fear in Bonn that tactical nuclear weapons would be used even in small, local conflicts, resulting in the devastation of large parts of Germany – a matter of great public concern in the country ever since the Carte Blanche NATO exercise in 1955 had revealed the destructive power of tactical nuclear weapons. 40 The Political Directive, echoing Nitze’s Foreign Affairs article, called for shield forces able “to deal with incidents such as in - filtrations, incursions or hostile local actions by the Soviets, or by Sat ellites with or without overt or covert Soviet support” and to do so “without nec - essarily having recourse to nuclear weapons.” 41 On the other hand, the new NATO strategy document MC 14/2 of April 1957 stated that, if the Soviets were involved in a local hostile action and sought to broaden the scope of such an incident or to prolong it, the situation would call for the utilization of all weapons and forces at NATO’s dis - posal, since in no case is there a NATO concept of limited war with the Soviets. 42 The tension between these two statements illustrates how difficult it re - mained for NATO to deal with different scenarios of possible aggression in Europe. In response, the Eisenhower Administration now started considering ways of sharing tactical nuclear weapons with NATO allies. Before this could be done, however, Congress had to be convinced to change the Atomic Energy Act. 43 This promised to be a tough fight, as Chalmers Roberts, the foreign policy commentator of the Washington Post , wrote in a paper for the Fiuggi conference: The Anglo-French venture at Suez increased the reluctance of the Co ngress even to alter the law so as to permit American nuclear weap - ons to be put in the hands of NATO allies prior to the outbreak of war. There is a broad American concern that such weapons, if made"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"NATO, nuclear strategy, and the Cold War 181 av ailable, might be used for reasons considered contrary to American interests just as American-supplied weapons were used in Suez and are being used in Algeria. 44 Kissinger on nuclear weapons and foreign policy Not surprisingly, the informal alliance was deeply involved in the transat - lantic debates over nuclear strategy. Several Bilderberg members, including Joseph Johnson, Paul Nitze, and David Rockefeller, took part in a Council on Foreign Relations study group on nuclear weapons and foreign policy. Rockefeller had suggested that Henry Kissinger, then a Harvard lecturer in government, should serve as study director. 45 Kissinger had just finished his dissertation on Metternich and Castlereagh and was eager to apply his knowledge of grand strategy to contemporary debates. After the Council on Foreign Relations study group finished its work in mid-1956, Kissinger set out to synthesize its conclusions. Even before Kissinger published the resulting volume, Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy, in June 1957, he par - ticipated in the St. Simons Island Bilderberg conference and contributed a paper on nuclear strategy. Yet because the debate about the Suez crisis took up so much time, the discussion on nuclear strategy was postponed until the next Bilderberg conference in Fiuggi in early October. Given the fact that US and NATO nuclear strategy was very much in flux, the timing of Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy could not have been bet - ter. Not only did Kissinger provide an incisive analysis of the reasons why massive retaliation was no longer valid; he also contributed several sugges - tions for solving the strategic puzzle which divided both the alliance and the Eisenhower administration. Kissinger argued convincingly that American strategic doctrine had been dominated by technical and economic considerations, leading to a dan - gerous reliance on the threat of massive retaliation. 46 The most important reason why massive retaliation was no longer credible was the rapidly devel - oping Soviet nuclear arsenal. As Kissinger argued in his paper for the Fiuggi conference (a condensed version of his book): No matter how vast our remaining margin in number and technological refinement of nuclear weapons, henceforth every objective in all-out war must be weighed in terms of the destruction of American cities. It is not that we will refuse to fight for what we consider our vital interests, it is that the line between what is essential and what is peripheral will shift if we must weigh all objectives against the obliteration of Chicago, New York or Washington. Moreover, even if we are willing to pay the price, it is doubt - ful whether victory in an all-out war retains any concrete meaning. 47 Under the current strategic doctrine, Kissinger wrote, the president of the United States would be faced with the choice between surrender and all-out"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"182 NATO, nuclear strategy, and the Cold War w ar in case of Soviet aggression. To increase his range of options – and thereby to increase the overall credibility of the deterrent – Kissinger called for an enhanced capability to wage limited war (in direct contradiction to NATO strategy MC 14/2). 48 He argued that a limited war using tactical nu - clear weapons was possible, because the threat of thermonuclear warfare would induce the enemy to accept defeat in a local war rather than risk general devastation. In practical terms, this meant that the American mil - itary forces should be reorganized into one strategic force, responsible for thermonuclear warfare, and a tactical force required for conducting limited war. At present, the lack of a clear strategic doctrine meant that the Air Force, the Army and the Navy were engaged in an expensive and unneces - sar y inter- se rvice competition in which all three services attempted to de - velop a capability for all-out war. Kissinger was not the first to criticize massive retaliation or to introduce the idea of limited war. He had borrowed heavily from Admiral Buzzard’s writings on graduated deterrence and from American strategic thinkers such as Bernard Brodie and William Kaufmann. 49 But he was the first who man - aged to popularize the notion that massive retaliation had become highly problematic and to call for a reassessment of the relationship between for - eign policy and nuclear weapons. 50 As Chalmers Roberts, the reporter who did most to bring Kissinger’s book to the attention of a wider public, wrote: [...] this volume for the first time marries the two sides of the central problem of American policy: the nature and military meaning of nu - clear weapons and the problem of conducting a foreign policy in the light of the nuclear facts of life. In his review of Nuclear Strategy and Foreign Policy , Roberts called it the most important book of the year, adding: This is a book which, if one may say so, President Eisenhower should curl up with over a long weekend in the quiet of his Gettysburg farm and Secretary Dulles in the isolation of his Duck Island retreat. It should be read by every top civilian and military leader in the nation. 51 In early September, Roberts reported that Secretary of State Dulles had followed his advice and “agreed with at least the Kissinger thesis that a small nuclear war is possible.” The book could be spotted on a good many Pe ntagon bureaus and the Joint Chiefs of Staff had discussed it. “All in all,” Roberts wrote, “this is a remarkable tribute to the written word in a time of hurry-hurry and an Administration not noted for its egghead approach to public affairs.” 52 What Roberts did not know was that President Eisenhower had already read the book – or at least the summary prepared by his aide, General An drew Goodpaster. Henry Cabot Lodge, the US representative to the"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"NATO, nuclear strategy, and the Cold War 183 U nited Nations, had recommended it to Eisenhower in late July, saying that it was “so clear-headed, profound and constructive that I think it is most important that you should know about it.” 53 The president, in turn, sent a memorandum on Kissinger’s book to his Under Secretary of State, Ch ristian A. Herter. Eisenhower told Herter that [...] there are flaws in his arguments and, at the very least, if we were to or - ganize and maintain military forces along the lines he suggests, we would have what George Humphrey always calls ‘both the old and the new’. But Kissinger’s book was important, the president added, because of his analysis of “some general or popular conceptions and misconceptions.” 54 The fact that Dulles had authorized Roberts to report that he, Dulles, agreed with Kissinger’s view on limited nuclear war was telling. 55 The secre - tary of state hoped that small and relatively clean tactical nuclear weapons, which appeared technically feasible in the near future, would help to solve the basic problem which had haunted NATO since the early 1950s: how to diminish the reliance on massive retaliation while keeping defense costs at an acceptable level. In an article for Foreign Affairs Dulles wrote that by 1960 it might be possible to defend NATO countries against a full-scale con - ventional attack without having recourse to massive retaliation. Thus the tables may be turned, in the sense that instead of those who are non-aggressive having to rely upon all-out retaliatory power for their protection, would-be aggressors will be unable to count on a successful conventional aggression, but must themselves weigh the consequences of invoking nuclear war. 56 Nuclear strategy and the 1957 Fiuggi conference The Foreign Affairs article by Dulles appeared just before the Fiuggi con - ference in early October, 1957. Combined with all the media attention for Nu clear Weapons and Foreign Policy , there could be little doubt that Kissinger’s book was having an impact. As Admiral Buzzard told Nitze: “I need hardly say that we are all greatly encouraged by Dr. Kissinger’s book and Mr. Dulles’ latest article, both of which almost make people like me respectable over here!” 57 Accordingly, the conference at Fiuggi featured a long debate on Kissinger’s ideas. The one thing everyone agreed on was that Kissinger’s basic conclusion about massive retaliation was right on the mark. In the words of the Fiuggi report: “[...] it was generally agreed that Russia’s capacity for thermo-nuclear attack on American territory had made the threat of massive thermo-nuclear retaliation less convincing as a deterrent.” 58 But this was about as far as the consensus went. On the crucial issues of limited war and nuclear control opinions were divided."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"184 NATO, nuclear strategy, and the Cold War K issinger argued that future wars would be “short, sharp clashes” and “as much a test of will as of power.” 59 The threat of escalation – meaning all-out nuclear war – would keep a limited war from expanding. To make sure that a war could be ended in time, Kissinger argued, the West should make its limited aims clear through continued diplomacy during a conflict. In practi - cal terms, Kissinger proposed a zone of 500 miles on both sides of a demar - cation line in which tactical nuclear weapons could be used. Cities without military installations could be declared open cities with a 30-mile radius in which no nuclear weapons were to be used. But Kissinger did not make clear whether these open cities would be exposed to conventional attack. Several European participants rejected Kissinger’s arguments about lim - ited nuclear war. Reginald Maudling argued that it was highly unlikely that any war between the United States and the Soviet Union would remain lim - ited. The West should therefore continue to rely primarily on its capacity for massive retaliation. 60 Fritz Erler also disagreed with Kissinger, but for slightly different reasons: Erler thought that only a large-scale Soviet at - tack on Europe could not remain limited. If NATO used nuclear weapons in defense of a major conventional attack, the Soviet Union would do so as well, and a “global war” would break out. In addition, Erler warned that a war in Europe fought with tactical nuclear weapons would end up destroy - ing the continent. “For Europe,” he argued, “every application of nuclear weapons becomes close to self-destruction.” Even tactical weapons in the 1–20 ki loton range “would destroy what should be defended.” 61 Paul Nitze had still another reason for rejecting Kissinger’s views on lim - ited nuclear war. Kissinger, in Nitze’s view, had failed to understand some of the basic technical facts about nuclear weapons. Just before the Fiuggi meeting, Nitze had published a scathing review of Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy in The Reporter . He pointed out that Kissinger miscalculated the increase in blast and heat effects of nuclear weapons compared with con - ventional explosives. According to Kissinger “the blast effect of the twenty- ki loton bomb exploded over Hiroshima was only ten times greater than a twenty-ton TNT blockbuster,” whereas in reality it was one hundred times greater. “This may possibly explain,” Nitze remarked dryly, “why Kissinger thinks that five-hundred-kiloton weapons are appropriate for inclusion in an arsenal for a limited nuclear strategy designed to spare from annihilation the inhabitants of a geographic area in which the campaign is to be fought.” Nitze also called Kissinger’s plan for a limited zone and open cities com - pletely unrealistic. There were few areas in Europe where two cities were further than 60 miles apart. It was to be expected, therefore, that all cities would simply be declared open cities. “We are then right back where we started from: either the Russians under threat of massive retaliation fore - swear aggression against Western Europe or the war Kissinger contem - plates is a conventional war.” 62 Nitze later recalled that when Kissinger heard about Nitze’s review from the editor of The Reporter , he threatened a libel suit. 63 Nonetheless, Nitze"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"NATO, nuclear strategy, and the Cold War 185 d ecided to publish it, after carefully checking for any mistakes. The Fiuggi conference was the first occasion when the two met after this unpleasant episode; in Nitze’s version of events, Kissinger used it to apologize. He told Nitze that he had negotiated a deal with The Reporter giving him unlimited space for a reply to Nitze’s review. Having reached “page 149” of his reply, Kissinger said, he realized there must be something wrong with his original ideas. 64 Not surprisingly, Kissinger abandoned the idea of limited nuclear war in his next book, The Necessity for Choice , published in 1960. 65 Apart from the many question marks concerning limited nuclear war, the Fiuggi discussions revealed a more general problem with Kissinger’s book. As Eisenhower had said, Kissinger analyzed several “general misconcep - tions.” In fact, Kissinger perpetuated the most tenacious misconception, namely that NATO relied only on a thermonuclear response for its defense. As we have seen, the Eisenhower Administration itself was to blame for this perception, but actual NATO strategy embraced strong shield forces as an important part of deterrence. Kissinger ignored this aspect of MC 48 as well as the subsequent development of NATO nuclear strategy – the 1956 Political Directive and MC 14/2. As a Foreign Office analysis of Kissinger’s Bilderberg paper, prepared for Lord Kilmuir, put it: [...] it is worth mentioning that Mr. Kissinger, in referring to the ‘shield forces’ does not refer to its two main objectives: to hold a Soviet attack until the strategic counter attack becomes effective, and to deal with border incidents to ensure that they do not spread. 66 To put it differently, by ignoring the actual NATO strategy, Kissinger could pretend that a ‘pure’ version of massive retaliation fully dictated NATO strategic doctrine. At the same time, Kissinger was undoubtedly correct about the strong tendency in the Eisenhower administration to rely on massive retaliation. Moreover, the deficiencies of NATO’s shield forces were such that, in prac - tice, the West still very much depended on the US Strategic Air Command and the British Bomber Command. As Nitze put it at Fiuggi: If we look at the trends of the last few years certain things seem to stand out: (1) a decreasing allocation of resources expressed in percent of G.N.P. to defense; (2) an increasing reliance on nuclear weapons for that defense, and (3) an increasing posture of covering tactical weakness with a willingness to take great strategic risks. Major General James McCormack Jr., another member of the CFR study group and a former director at the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), re - sponded that the economic limits imposed on defense budgets had to be accepted. But Nitze disagreed, arguing: “[t]his point of view is sound for those who must carry out military policy within the resources which they"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"186 NATO, nuclear strategy, and the Cold War a re given. It seems to me that a group such as this, however, can take a dif - fe r e nt v i ew.” 67 To reverse these trends, Nitze submitted an ambitious program, “elabo - rated” the previous evening with Giovanni Malagodi “over several bottles of Mr. Malagodi’s [Soave] wine.” The plan prefigured the much more activist line in transatlantic relations the Kennedy Administration would take in the early 1960s. It contained seven elements: (1) an increase in US defense spend - ing from $38 billion to $48 billion by 1960; (2) a reversal “of the trend toward sole reliance on nuclear weapons” by a conventional buildup; (3) “Suggest to the European powers that they increase their conventional forces while we also make nuclear weapons available to them;” (4) the United States should join the European Free Trade Area or the Common Market; (5) NATO should move towards a semi-federal structure; (6) on the periphery, coun - tries such as India should be assisted in their economic development; and (7) “Expanded exchange program with U.S.S.R. and satellites – negotiations in the future from posture of strength and psychological penetration.” 68 The ambitious scope of Nitze’s plan was perhaps partly alcohol-induced, but it also reflected the genuine sense of crisis within NATO, exacerbated by the Sputnik shock. To pull the alliance together in the wake of Suez and Sputnik, Nitze and Malagodi obviously thought that a concerted ef - fort in all these different areas was necessary. Whether the idea of NATO moving in a federal or semi-federal direction was feasible or not could be debated, but bold action was necessary to restore confidence in the alliance. As Ma lagodi said, the “equilibrium of terror” had led to fears in Europe that the United States “would not attack [the] Russians with [the] ultimate weapons if Europe were attacked.” 69 According to Malagodi, the West needed to “recapture some of the mood of [the] Ma rshall Plan, Truman Doctrine and NATO.” More ground and sea forces would be necessary to counter the “great wave of fear” that engulfed Europe. The “reciprocal lowering of [trade] barriers” between Europe and the United States should secure the economic base necessary to sustain an increased defense effort. 70 Nitze made clear that he thought too much reliance on massive retalia - tion would lead to “a dispersion of nuclear defense capabilities among fur - ther members of the alliance and a tendency toward increased reliance on one’s own forces rather than on the common forces of the alliance.” 71 Nitze did not outline how a program of nuclear sharing should be organized, but he implied that if nothing was done to address Europe’s nuclear worries, NA TO’s collective security system would be in danger. Lincoln Go rdon strongly supported Nitze on this point. If the Soviets succeeded once in breaching NATO’s defensive line, the thermonuclear deterrent would be little more than a “paper tiger.” Thermonuclear weapons, Gordon argued, were “[...] not appropriate for border instances or far away fracas.” There - fore, it was essential to strengthen conventional forces in Europe and pro - vide the Eu ropean allies with tactical atomic weapons. 72"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"NATO, nuclear strategy, and the Cold War 187 E vidence to substantiate Nitze’s argument about nuclear proliferation was readily available in a much-noted paper written by the French General Pierre M. Gallois. Gallois maintained that massive retaliation continued to be a credible deterrent for the nuclear powers if they kept their nuclear forces dispersed and strong enough. If the Soviets could not count on de - stroying virtually all of the opponent’s retaliatory forces, Gallois wrote, any rational cost-benefit analysis would produce a decision against an attack. Gallois agreed with Kissinger, however, that for the non-nuclear countries, the American nuclear guarantee lost much of its credibility in the face of increasing Soviet air power. For each of the powers of the alliance which do not possess nuclear weapons the question is this: Might it find itself in such a situation that an incident of major importance for its own security or independence might be considered minor not only by guaranteeing atomic powers but also by the other member countries of the alliance? The Soviet Union might embark on a strategy of small probing actions in order to undermine the Western nuclear line of defense. If the West did not react strongly enough to such probes, Moscow would be in a position to en - gage in nuclear blackmail and to repeat the kind of aggressive policy Hitler was able to pull off without real opposition in the years preceding World War II. 73 In response, Gallois opted for what he called the “decentralisation of nu - clear weapons” in Western Europe, writing: If the deterrent was only likely to operate on the national level – and not if it is the tool of one of the members of the defensive coalition used on behalf of others – then it would be at the national level that the nuclear weapons would have to be decentralised. National deterrents might be the only way both to reassure Western Eu ropean countries that their vital interests would not be sacrificed on the altar of (American) public opinion and to reduce the chances that Moscow would attempt nuclear blackmail. The Suez crisis was clearly on the gener - a l’s m i nd. 74 Gallois, who had worked at SHAPE himself, did not suggest any kind of NATO solution. He only mentioned “individual possession” of nuclear weap - ons or “the possession by groups of nations with very closely connected in - terests” – implying that NATO did not fit this definition. 75 During the Fiuggi d iscussion, only Etienne de la Vallée Poussin openly agreed with Ga llois. De la Vallée Pousin argued that the Western European Union should be trans - formed into a European nuclear deterrent using Great Bri tain’s nuclear weapons. Several other speakers agreed that Europe should have more con - trol over nuclear weapons, but the Fiuggi discussion was inconclusive about"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"188 NATO, nuclear strategy, and the Cold War h ow to cover Europe’s strategic nakedness. Kissinger, for example, argued that: “[t]he United States must take the initiative in developing a capability and a doctrine for the local defense of Europe and in making available the necessary weapons.” 76 But Kissinger, Nitze, Gordon, and Malagodi were all unable to make any detailed suggestions on the best way of doing so. Even if the Fiuggi conference did not deliver any ready-made solutions, the discussions did help to make several things clear. First, continuing the trend already apparent at Garmisch, nuclear strategy had become a polit - ical issue of the first order. The unsolved problems about nuclear control and limited war could no longer be contained by informal agreements or by simply ignoring them. The crucial question – which would continue to haunt NATO for many years to come – was how to decide beforehand at what point a conflict in Europe warranted a nuclear response and who should make this decision. This question had major implications for the structure and size of NATO’s forces, for NATO strategic planning, and, consequently, for national defense budgets. But most important were the political implications. Would public opinion in the West accept an overwhelming reliance on thermonuclear weapons for its defense when all-out war would equal suicide? Would European govern - ments continue to accept the American monopoly on nuclear weapons? As Quaroni wrote in a steering committee paper not long after Fiuggi: A fair and reasonable solution of the question who gives the order for pressing the button of the I.R.B.M.; the absence of discrimination and a considerable revision of the MacMahon [sic] Act are three political questions to which I think I have the duty to draw the attention of our American friends. For if the Government of the United States insists on maintaining the position it is holding now there is a real danger that all these will simply strengthen a threat which is already strong towards a helpless neutralism. 77 Yet what were the alternatives? Strong NATO shield forces - even if rein - forced by tactical nuclear weapons under SACEUR control – might not be sufficient for some European powers. The clear implication of Gallois’ pa - per was that Europe should have its own strategic deterrent, whether owned nationally or controlled by the WEU or some other organization. These conclusions reached official circles on the North American con - tinent in several different ways. On October 15, Dana Wilgress sent Lester Pearson a lengthy memorandum on the state of NATO. Wilgress’ analy - sis was based to a large extent on the Fiuggi discussions. 78 The Canadian Am bassador in Rome, Pierre Dupuy, also wrote a report on the Fiuggi meeting. He confirmed that during the discussion of Kissinger’s paper, [...] a number of the European participants were under the impression that in the process of re-adapting their military establishments to the"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"NATO, nuclear strategy, and the Cold War 189 n eeds of nuclear warfare, the United States was slowly moving away from Europe. [...] No one among our U.S. friends present was in a position to give any assurances on behalf of Washington, but reports have since very probably reached the proper authorities in the State Department. 79 Nitze indeed sent his report on the Fiuggi meeting to his former colleagues at the State Department’s Policy Planning Staff (PPS). 80 The PPS had be - come a hotbed of opposition to massive retaliation, with staff members such as Henry Owen, Leon Fuller, and their boss Assistant Secretary of State for Policy Planning Gerard Smith arguing for a much more flexible strategy along the lines of Nitze’s thinking. 81 The report by Nitze supplied them with further ammunition and confirmed a Policy Planning analysis of July 1957 regarding the effects of the approaching nuclear parity on European atti - tudes. Increasing doubt about the credibility of the US deterrent, the PPS concluded, “[...] inclines some of our major allies to consider the creation of nuclear capabilities of their own. It also contributes to neutralism and a disposition toward accommodation with the USSR.” 82 At the time of the Fiuggi conference, Nitze was also engaged in the writ - ing of the Gaither Report. Officially known as the Security Resources Panel, the Gaither Committee, headed by H. Rowan Gaither, the chairman of the boards of the Ford Foundation and the RAND Corporation, had been appointed by President Eisenhower in April 1957 to study the most effective ways of protecting the American civil population against nuclear attack. 83 The report, which was presented to President Eisenhower in early No vember 1957, made the case for vastly increased defense spending. By late 1959, the report stated, the American deterrent would be extremely vulner - able to a surprise attack by Soviet missiles if nothing was done to make US forces more secure by improving early warning systems and by speeding up US ballistic missile programs – in other words, by creating a secure ‘second- st rike capability.’ 84 Officially, Nitze was only an advisor to the Gaither Committee, but since he was responsible for writing large parts of the report, he did influence its message and alarmist tone – which, in any case, reflected the general dis - satisfaction with Eisenhower’s defense strategy among key members of the committee. 85 The Gaither Committee argued that US and allied limited war capabilities should be improved. This was, of course, another way of saying that massive retaliation was outdated. The report called for a concerted ef - fort to embed the defense measures in a broader foreign policy program for the free world. If not so integrated into our foreign policy, any substantial program to reduce the vulnerability of the United States might be widely inter - preted as signaling a retreat to ‘Fortress America.’ The USSR would be sure to fully exploit the resulting uncertainties."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"190 NATO, nuclear strategy, and the Cold War T he Gaither report listed three general areas of concern for such a program: 1 Me asures, some of which are already under way to pool and make more effective the economic, technological and political resources of our - selves and our allies. 2 Su pplying NATO with nuclear weapons, to remain in U.S. custody in peacetime, for use in wartime under NATO command – as a means of increasing confidence. 3 Me asures designed to assure the uncommitted nations that their na - tional interests are truly a matter of continuing concern to us. 86 Taken together, these three points, and the calls for increased defense spend - ing and stronger limited war capabilities are strikingly similar to Nitze’s proposals at the Fiuggi meeting. President Eisenhower, however, continued to resist many of the more far-reaching (and expensive) recommendations of the report, although his public rhetoric reflected some of its conclusions. 87 Disengagement, China, and the Berlin crisis Meanwhile, Khrushchev did all he could to reap the propagandistic fruits of Sputnik. With a mixture of threatening messages and calls for disarmament and a summit meeting he kept Western audiences spellbound. One of the Soviet proposals involved a plan for a nuclear-free zone in Germany, Poland and Czechoslovakia, originally proposed by the Polish Foreign Minister Adam Rapacki on October 2, 1957 and endorsed by Moscow in December. Similar ideas had in fact been discussed at several Bilderberg meetings, and British and West-German social-democrats such as Healey, Gaitskell, and Erler were in favor of a military disengagement in Central Europe. Healey had presented a plan at the St. Simons Island meeting involving the creation of a neutral zone in Central Europe and the mutual withdrawal of NATO forces from West Germany and Soviet forces from Eastern Europe. Most Bilderberg participants, however, had rejected Healey’s proposal because it might well mean the end of NATO. 88 As the report of a Bilderberg steering committee meeting in early January 1958 put it: “European demands for dis - engagement might revive isolationist feelings in the United States and sim - ilarly American interest in negotiating a European settlement with Ru ssia might revive Europe’s traditional fears of an American withdrawal.” 89 One Bilderberger who agreed with what C. D. Jackson called the “H ealey Doctrine” was George Kennan, and not long after the Fiuggi meeting, Ke nnan reached a large, worldwide audience with his own plans for disengage - ment through the BBC’s Reith Lectures. The informal alliance now became deeply involved in the transatlantic response to Kennan’s Reith Lectures. The Am erican Council on Germany, in particular, orchestrated a major publicity campaign against Kennan’s ideas, featuring, among others, Kennan’s former boss Dean Acheson in a fierce put-down of Kennan’s lectures. 90"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"NATO, nuclear strategy, and the Cold War 191 T he Bilderberg organizers, meanwhile, organized an enlarged steering committee session in the original Bilderberg Hotel to discuss what they per - ceived as the increasing risk of neutralism in Europe. Two first-time par - ticipants were NATO Secretary General Paul-Henri Spaak and New York Times cursive columnist Cyrus Sulzberger. 91 Spaak strongly opposed any proposal for the neutralization of Germany, but acknowledged that the West needed to offer positive ideas to deal with disarmament and a possible East- West summit. As long as the complete withdrawal of US forces from the con - tinent could be avoided, Spaak was even willing to discuss the Rapacki Plan. Sulzberger wrote two columns about the Bilderberg meeting. Addressing the Soviet calls for a summit meeting, which had found such a receptive au - dience in Europe, he argued that enthusiasm was limited in the United States after the disappointments of Geneva, Potsdam, and Yalta. However, if a sum - mit was to take place, a “coordinated but flexible approach” by NATO was necessary. Sulzberger mentioned Spaak’s conditions (no neutralization of Germany and no withdrawal of US forces) as a possible basis for agreement and added that Spaak would introduce them to NATO’s foreign ministers. 92 Sulzberger added that “local Socialists” – presumably Fritz Erler – argued that “if all Germans are convinced the West has made a serious effort to disengage only to be rebuffed, Adenauer’s NATO policy would at last be sup - ported by the opposition.” In the Federal Republic, the debate about dis - engagement had been especially virulent because of the parallel discussions concerning the nuclear arming of the Bundeswehr . Therefore, the fact that Erler offered the possibility of support for Adenauer’s NATO policy was im - portant. Despite the SPD’s fundamental opposition to the nuclear arming of German soldiers, the party’s general attitude towards NATO was changing. In fact, during the Fiuggi conference, Erler and Carlo Schmid already had indicated that the SPD was moving away from its plan for a Europe-wide security system through the abolishment of NATO and the Warsaw Pact. The devastating defeat the SPD had suffered in the September 1957 elec - tions, they told the Bilderberg participants, would have consequences for the SPD’s foreign policy agenda. As Shepard Stone put it, “Fritz Erler and Carlo Schmid said the Bilderberg contact would have influence on SPD for - eign policy ideas in future.” 93 Although the SPD’s official acceptance of the Federal Republic’s Westbindung and NATO commitments did not come un - til the famous speech by Herbert Wehner on June 30, 1960, it was clear that the Bilderberg discussions were having an effect. 94 By the same token, Erler and Schmid were also influencing Western at - titudes towards the SPD. In the late 1950s, the German social-democrats increasingly came to be regarded as a viable alternative to the CDU and Adenauer. When John F. Kennedy became President in 1961, the tradi - tional US support for Adenauer was no longer a given. 95 With regard to the Ge rman problem – for example, the recognition of the Oder-Neisse line – the new Democratic administration undoubtedly stood closer to the views of Erler and Schmid than to Adenauer and the majority of the CDU."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"192 NATO, nuclear strategy, and the Cold War T he 1958 Bilderberg conference in Buxton, UK (September 13–15) did not feature another detailed discussion of the various disengagement plans. However, the debate on the Soviet Union and the future of East-West rela - tions left no doubt that a great majority of Bilderberg participants remained convinced that a negotiation with the Soviet Union about disengagement stood little chance of success and would severely undermine NATO unity. As several speakers said, all the indications were that the West should ex - pect a period of heightened rather than lessened tensions. Philip E. Mosely, director of studies at the Council on Foreign Relations and professor at the Russian Institute of Columbia University, warned that “The Soviet Union has achieved a position as a nuclear power which would enable it, in the absence of a well-organized and determined opposition, to impose its will on all of Western Europe and on free Asia.” Dean Acheson, the former sec - retary of state and architect of containment, underlined in a paper for the Buxton meeting: The [task] of political leadership in the West is to persuade the peoples of the West to develop their power position to the point where intentions hostile to their interests can be frustrated. Without this capacity, and without resolution of purpose, there seems no possibility of achieving two other ends which occupy much of the public discussion in the West: finding some accommodations with the Soviet state; and conducting successfully the cold war, the so-called battle for men’s minds. 96 General Cortlandt Schuyler, the chief of staff at SHAPE, was present to give a special presentation on MC 70 and current NATO strategy. General Schuyler gave an “admirable account of the present state of affairs,” in David Ormsby-Gore’s view. “He made a strong plea for countries to make every effort to achieve the target set in MC 70. He estimated the increased effort required would amount to an increase of 10% to 15% of existing de - fence budgets.” Schuyler reacted to several questions about the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons in response to aggression by emphasizing the deterrent purpose of strong shield forces. “The task of the shield is to hold an initial attack, and it must be of sufficient strength to meet and hold an aggressor, so that the onus of deciding to extend the conflict would rest with the enemy.” 97 Schuyler’s message was clear: with an extra effort to strengthen its shield forces, NATO’s defense strategy was valid, despite the recent doubts caused by Sputnik. NATO would be wise to put its own house in order instead of hoping for a far-reaching settlement with Moscow. The review of recent events at Buxton was dominated by the Qu emoy-Matsu crisis. In August 1958, Communist China had started shelling these small is - lands, only a few kilometers off the Chinese mainland’s coast, after Chiang Kai-Shek had started reinforcing the nationalist Ch inese forces occupying the islands. 98 Mao claimed that Chiang intended to use the islands as a forward base for attacks on the communists and that they belonged to the"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"NATO, nuclear strategy, and the Cold War 193 C hinese mainland. The United States, meanwhile, was committed to the de - fense of the islands since the first Quemoy-Matsu crisis of 1954–1955. Despite the fact that Eisenhower and Dulles were annoyed at Chiang’s behavior, they felt that they had to respond to what they regarded as Com munist C h i na’s aggression. Right before the Buxton conference, President Ei senhower had announced live on television that his administration would not abandon the islands. Quaroni raised the question why Mao had chosen this particular moment to start the crisis. He noted that Mao had not been enthusiastic about Sov iet efforts to bring about a summit conference. The shelling of the islands might amount to an attempt to sabotage Soviet designs. Moreover, a “stiff - ening” of internal policies in the Soviet Union and the satellites was visible. Was this a reaction to Mao, Quaroni asked? At the Garmisch conference, Qu aroni had compared the Soviet Union to malaria: “[i]t is wrong to believe oneself dead when the fever is rising very high. But it is an error even greater to believe that one is cured because the attack has ended.” 99 Now he asked: “Are we in for another malaria attack?” 100 Whatever the dynamics of Soviet-Chinese relations, all European Bi lderberg participants thought that the case for defending the islands was a bad one – “military nonsense,” as Gaitskell put it – and they worried about a military escalation, perhaps even involving nuclear weapons. Gaitskell argued that the island had no defensive value whatsoever for Formosa. 101 He aley added that no one thought that the case for defending the islands – and risking a wider war, perhaps even including the use of nuclear weapons – was “politically or morally justifiable.” It was a “good principle applied to a p oor c a s e.” 102 A quick poll of the participants confirmed that virtually all Am erican and Canadian participants agreed. 103 As Joseph Harsch, political commentator for the Christian Science Monitor and NBC, told his editor at NBC: “on a secret poll one vote only was cast in full favor of our Quemoy pol - icy (we were all trying to guess whether it was by C.D. Jackson, Gab Hauge, or Senator Case).” 104 Ormsby-Gore noted that “none of the Americans present seemed the least bit surprised at the European reaction to the situation.” 105 In fact, many of them agreed with the European assessment and could do little more than explain the political sensitivity of the Chinese question in the United States. 106 Harsch criticized that the Eisenhower Ad ministration’s response distracted from the real danger in the world: the alliance between the Soviet Union and China. With Russian help, China was fast becoming a major military power. “This conception,” Harsch argued, “should govern our every thought and action.” 107 Arthur Dean and David Ro ckefeller, per - haps influenced by the Fredensborg conference, thought that it made little sense not to accept the existence of Communist China, and John Mc Cloy, chairman of the board of the Chase Manhattan Bank and a first-time Bi lderberg participant, shared this assessment. At Buxton, he found him - self in agreement with much of the Europeans’ criticism of the Ei senhower Administration. 108"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"194 NATO, nuclear strategy, and the Cold War A fter McCloy had returned from Buxton, Secretary of State Dulles asked him to go to Taiwan to convince Chiang to back down over the islands. McCloy refused, in part because of his disagreement with the Eisenhower Ad ministration’s course, but also because of the likely treatment of the feared right-wing China lobby in Washington. He did make sure, however, to inform Dulles and President Eisenhower of the state of opinion in Europe he had encountered at the Bilderberg meeting. As Harsch told Retinger: I can report to you, under the rules of “Bilderberg secrecy”, that Jack McCloy’s confidential report at the White House on his return from Buxton was a major, perhaps even the decisive, factor in causing Am erican Far East policy to swing over from a “one-China” to a “two- China” line. He had been startled by the unanimity of view he encoun - tered at Buxton on the subject of Quemoy, and conveyed his reaction to the White House. I learned from several high sources that his report had a profound effect in the National Security Council. 109 The journalist Marquis Childs also learned about the Buxton discussions on China and warned of the negative impact of the Taiwan crisis on trans - atlantic relations. Quoting Acheson, who had pointed to “the threat to the Atlantic alliance inherent in the American stand,” Childs reported that the Buxton conference “was an important factor” in changing US policy on China. 110 Dulles ended up flying to Taiwan himself, where he convinced Chiang to renounce the use of force to reach his objective of ‘freeing’ mainland China. 111 In effect, this amounted to the acceptance of a ‘two-China’ policy, as The New York Times noted, even if it would take another 13 years before Kissinger and Nixon would engineer their opening to China. 112 Two months after the Buxton conference, Khrushchev issued his ultima - tum on Berlin. The Berlin crisis did not immediately end all hopes for some sort of disengagement. However, no one could deny that the likelihood of a settlement in Europe and a solution to the German question had become more remote. Then in March 1959, a visit to Moscow by Fritz Erler and Carlo Schmid put a temporary end to their hopes for disengagement. Schmid gave a full account of his nine-hour conversation with Kh rushchev during a special Bilderberg steering committee meeting on March 21–22, 1959, in Knokke, Belgium. Khrushchev had left no doubt that he was unin - terested in any disengagement or reunification proposals until the question of a peace treaty with East Germany was settled. Reunification had to be a matter of negotiations between the two Germanys, Khrushchev argued. Since all disengagement proposals hinged on a Soviet willingness to nego - tiate, this was a lethal blow to the SPD’s attempts to develop a realistic plan for reunification. In addition, Schmid was deeply impressed by the vigor and conviction with which Khrushchev argued his case on Berlin. Schmid concluded that the Soviet leader was not bluffing and would use nuclear"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"NATO, nuclear strategy, and the Cold War 195 weapons in the event of an armed conflict. Khrushchev repeatedly told Schmid that the closest bases to the Soviet Union would be the first ones to be hit. 113 During the steering committee meeting, Schmid argued that nuclear war “was too high a price to pay even to save the people of West Berlin.” 114 The conservative British MP Sir Frederic Bennett and the French so - cialist Jacques Piette both strongly opposed Schmid on this point. Piette warned that the West should not make unnecessary concessions in the face of Khrushchev’s nuclear threats. As Prince Bernhard summarized Piette’s words in his handwritten notes: if we have to make concessions re Berlin why the hell make more re dis - armament of Germany & disengagement? This sort of thing has been ruinous before! It leads to neutralism which means national & interna - tional disaster and the end of NATO. Kraft likewise repeated what Spaak and many others had said at previous Bilderberg meetings: “Here we should agree that US troops must not leave Europe!!! That would be the end of NATO.” 115 The Bilderberg discussions on nuclear strategy and disengagement were important on several different levels. For one, the Bilderberg participants themselves were exposed to information and expertise – from Ge neral Gr uenther’s candid talk on NATO strategy to the debate over Henry Ki ssinger’s influential study – that was difficult to find in most Eur opean countries. Experts such as Nitze and Buzzard were prompted by the Bi lderberg discussions to develop their thinking and publish the results in Foreign Affairs and elsewhere. The transnational contacts established at Bi lderberg, moreover, led to the creation of new organizations such as the Institute for Strategic Studies. Taken together, the Bilderberg Group con - tributed to the development of a transatlantic strategic culture and thus helped to “develop public opinion” (as General Gruenther had put it at Garmisch) about nuclear strategy within the alliance. On the political level, the Bilderberg discussions exposed important dif - ferences between those in favor of some form of military disengagement in Europe and those more concerned with NATO’s future and the dangers of neutralism. Again, the informal alliance had an important role to play and paved the way for the NATO-skeptical German SPD to basically ac - cept Chancellor Adenauer’s strategy of Westbindung by the end of the 1950s. The fact that high-ranking NATO officials frequently participated in the Bi lderberg meetings shows that they recognized the relevance of the infor - mal alliance in shaping attitudes in the member countries. In the United States, the State Department’s PPS played a crucial role in translating these transatlantic debates into policy change. As Policy Planning’s head Gerard Smith put it in his memoirs: “The Policy Planning staff served as a conduit for ideas from outside the State Department. We"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"196 NATO, nuclear strategy, and the Cold War c onsulted many such outside experts, such as Paul Nitze, Jerome Wiesner, Dean Rusk, Ernest Lawrence, Arnold Toynbee, Admiral Rickover, and Al bert Wohlstetter.” 116 Smith himself became convinced that a more flexible strategy relying much more strongly on the conventional defense of NATO was necessary and did much to educate Dulles on the weaknesses of massive retaliation. By the end of the 1950s, however, one thing was clear: the magic bullet to solve NATO’s nuclear dilemma had not been found. In the context of the Berlin crisis and strong pressures throughout the Atlantic world for disar - mament, nuclear strategy would remain high on the agenda of transatlantic relations. 117 Meanwhile, the fact that General Charles de Gaulle returned to power after the collapse of the Fourth Republic ensured that the question of independent nuclear forces in Europe (coupled with the general’s skepticism of NATO’s integrated military) would continue to occupy the formal and informal alliance.

P. E. Ramsbotham of the Foreign Office sent Macmillan’s Private Secretary, Philip de Zulueta, a critical analysis of the book in December 1957: Much of Dr. Kissinger’s book is highly persuasive in its rational presentation of the balance of advantage to both sides of limited over all-out war. But the rationality also seems to be its major defect. For the possibility of keeping any war limited is made to depend entirely upon the continuous, rational cal - culation of each side that to spread it would be more disastrous than to lose it. In the clamour and confusion of war this seems to be placing too much faith in human reason. In particular, Dr. Kissinger ignores the pressures of fear, anger, prestige and personal pride. Both popular demand and personal involvement of the leaders in success or failure would surely provide a pow- erful impulse to hit as hard as possible.

However, after the end of the French Fourth Republic and the return to power of Pres - ident Charles de Gaulle in May 1958, this slowly changed. De Gaulle’s vision of a more independent, French-led Europe clashed with the supranational po - litical ambitions of Europe’s founding fathers. Moreover, de Gaulle’s refusal to accept the United States’ leadership position within NATO, coupled with his determination to disentangle the French military from NATO integration, questioned the basic Atlanticist consensus underlying the Bi lderberg Group. This chapter explores the resulting tensions in the period 1958–1962, revolv - ing around three key issues: the plans for a Free Trade Area (FTA) linking the Common Market to the rest of the OEEC countries, especially Great Britain; de Gaulle’s proposals to create a French-British-American leadership council to deal with global issues; and the nuclear question. The Bi lderberg discus - sions reveal how closely interrelated these issues were. At the same time, the global Cold War kept the Western alliance on edge, with crisis points ranging from Berlin to Algeria, and from New Guinea to the Congo. For the Bilderberg Group, President de Gaulle’s authoritarian national - ism meant a serious challenge to the internationalist, global mindset of most of its participants. Perhaps even more important than de Gaulle’s ideas were his style and methods of communication. De Gaulle’s preference to deal only with fellow leaders, his tendency not to inform even his closest advisors of important decisions, and his Hobbesian conviction that nations do not have friends, only interests, were hardly compatible with Bilderberg’s reli - ance on informal discussions and international understanding. As a result, French interest in Bilderberg seemed to be in terminal decline right at the moment that Retinger retired as secretary general i n 1959.

De Gaulle was perceived to be the only statesman possess - ing the prestige and toughness necessary to bring the Algerian war to an end. As a result, even socialists such as Guy Mollet voted for a new consti - tution giving the president of the Fifth Republic far-reaching constitutional powers, especially in the fields of foreign and defense policy. President de Gaulle did not hesitate to make use of these powers. He quickly and determinedly challenged many of the assumptions on which the Atlantic alliance and the European Communities were founded. De Gaulle’s fundamental purpose was to return France on the world stage as a great power. This corresponded with his deeply held views about the histori - cal role France had to play in the world. But it was also de Gaulle’s answer to the difficult question of how France could restore its self-confidence after a prolonged period of national failure. The guiding principle of all his actions was simple: “France is only France when she is in the first rank.” 1 One of the most important implications was that de Gaulle could not tolerate the predominant American leadership position in NATO. Fur - thermore, with respect to the European Economic Community (EEC), de Gaulle refused to accept the supranational political aims Mollet and the other founding fathers had associated with the Brussels communities. In May 1958, of course, no one knew exactly what de Gaulle planned to do. But one thing was clear: as Dulles told Spaak after his first conversation with de Gaulle in July 1958, “We shall have a rough time.” 2 Not surprisingly, many feared first and foremost for the future of the EEC. De Gaulle had consistently opposed plans for supranational integration and could easily wreck the newly founded Common Market. After all, the first six years of the EEC were a crucially important period, since many of the most difficult issues – in cluding a common agricultural policy – had been left unresolved; the most far-reaching measures to eradicate trade barriers and abolish the veto in the decision-making process of the European Com - munities would not come into force until the mid 1960s. Unexpectedly, however, President de Gaulle accepted the Common Ma rket as an important device to modernize and strengthen the French economy. Moreover, his financial advisors Antoine Pinay and Jacques Rueff – who both participated in the September 1958 Bilderberg conference in Buxton – convinced him that France needed to devalue the franc, reign in her budget deficits, and open up her economy to foreign competition in a concerted effort to restore confidence in the currency, reverse the balance of payments difficulties, and bring down inflation. 3 By pushing through this program, de Gaulle made it possible for France to take part in the first scheduled reduction of trade barriers among the Six in January 1959 and in effect saved the Common Market. 4 Both de Gaulle’s acceptance of the EEC and his courageous economic program earned him a great deal of political capital in pro-European circles. De Gaulle took a less benign view of the Free Trade Area proposed by Great Britain in the fall of 1956. He announced in November 1958 – more"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"The return of nationalism 205 o r less at the same time as Khrushchev’s Berlin ultimatum – that he did not expect the FTA negotiations with Great Britain and the other members of the OEEC to succeed. 5 These negotiations had gone on for over a year in an OEEC committee chaired by Bilderberg steering committee member Re ginald Maudling. 6 The French position angered not only Great Britain, but also most gov - ernments of the other five EEC members. Particularly in the Netherlands and in West Germany, many worried about the prospect of a protectionist, French-dominated EEC causing a dangerous split in Europe. In the case of West Germany, however, proponents of the FTA like Ludwig Erhard were held in check by Chancellor Adenauer, who gave priority to building a good relationship with de Gaulle in order to secure French support in the Berlin crisis and the preservation of the Common Market. 7 The Bilderberg organizers quickly decided to organize another enlarged steering committee meeting at the Bilderberg Hotel (January 17–19, 1959) to discuss the FTA crisis. As Retinger told Johnson: we believe that the collapse of negotiations between the “Six” and the rest of Europe may be extremely dangerous and possibly lead to an economic war in Europe; this situation may bring about the collapse of a number of European official organisations, such as the European Pa yments Union, the Common Market itself, the Council of Europe and may also influence the future of NATO. I have had an opportunity of consulting a number of people in authority and members of the gov - ernments of different European countries and in the eyes of many the situation looks disastrous. On the other hand, there is some hope that our private and confidential exchange of views may have some fruitful influence on the final deliberations of the official bodies. Incidentally, Reginald Maudling told me yesterday that some members of the OEEC are trying to postpone their meeting on 15th January until after our own meeting in the hope that our discussions may clarify people’s minds. 8 The steering committee meeting was probably the most direct attempt by the Bilderberg organizers to engage in informal diplomacy, and it brought together several of those directly involved in the FTA negotiations: Ernst van der Beugel, a high-level Dutch diplomat close to Foreign Minister Jo seph Luns; Reginald Maudling; Alfred Müller-Armack, the secretary of state in Erhard’s economics ministry; and Jean Rey, the Belgian member of the EEC Commission responsible for external trade relations. Walter Ha llstein, the president of the EEC Commission, planned to come, but had to cancel because of illness. In addition to the FTA negotiators, the heads of the French and German employers’ organizations, George Villiers and Fritz Berg, and the Overseas Director of the Federation of British In dustries, Pet er Te nnant, were all present, as was Hubert Ansiaux, the president of the Belgian National Bank."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"206 The return of nationalism T he other European participants less directly involved in the FTA negotiations were Gianni Agnelli, Raymond Aron, Louis Camu, Hugh Gaitskell, Viscount Kilmuir, Jens Otto Krag, Giovanni Malagodi, Bertil Ohlin, Alberto Pirelli, Jacques Piette, and Otto Wolff. From the United States, George Ball, Arthur Dean, John Ferguson, Jack Heinz, Joseph Johnson, and George Nebolsine were present. They had been briefed on the US position with regard to the FTA by the State Department. Given the sensitivity of the issue, it was agreed that George Ball would pre - pare a position paper that would guide the American participants in the discussion. 9 Just before the Bilderberg meeting, Gaitskell travelled to France – in his own words, in order “to find out what I could about the background of the Free Trade Area – Common Market negotiations.” He met with President de Gaulle, Prime Minister Debré, Foreign Minister Couve de Murville, and a number of politicians and journalists. With respect to the general politi - cal situation in France, Gaitskell remained concerned about extreme right- wing forces in the country: “Some say that Soustelle, with the help of the Army, will get rid of de Gaulle; others that de Gaulle will allow himself to become the instrument of the Fascists; others that de Gaulle will become more authoritarian.” With respect to the future of the European C ommuni - ties, Gaitskell asked de Gaulle directly “if he thought the Common Market would lead to political union.” The French president pointedly answered that it was “a purely commercial affair.” 10 De Gaulle’s refusal to accept the EEC as a political project was at the heart of the central paradox that would determine the European scene for a decade: the ever-present possibility of destroying the European C ommu - nities enabled de Gaulle to basically blackmail pro-European forces – from Jean Monnet to Konrad Adenauer – into supporting him on all develop - ments concerning the Common Market. Because decision-making by the Six was unanimous, there was little the other Five could do about this. Raymond Aron was mainly responsible at Hotel de Bilderberg for trying to explain the French position. He argued that the breakdown in the ne - gotiations was partly based on France’s long history of protectionism. At the same time, the fact that the Common Market was much more than a simple free trade area explained why Paris was reluctant to give preferential treatment to the other eleven OEEC members without a harmonization of social policies, a common external tariff, or the coordination of economic policies. 11 Fritz Berg had contributed a paper arguing for a gradual, sector- by -sector approach to the FTA question and Maudling and several others attempted to push this as the basis for new negotiations. Aron, however, doubted whether the French government would be interested. Moreover, any halfway solution was likely to breach existing GATT rules. In addition, many in the French political and administrative class continued to regard the common market as “morally and politically” different from a classic free trade area. 12"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"The return of nationalism 207 S everal of the French and Italian participants, including Malagodi, Pi ette, and Quaroni, underlined Aron’s point about the political importance of the common market. As Quaroni put it, the idea of Europe had a certain “mys - tic content”: I don’t think that 99% of the people in Europe have the faintest idea what the common market means. They simply think of the common market as something which will stop French, Germans, Italians to look at each other like dogs, or worse, and think in terms of facing the com - mon danger. And if when the European Army failed, we could more or less fill the gap. If the common market fails, I really don’t know what we can invent to fill this gap. I am very much afraid of the consequences, the moral consequences in most European countries when the youth cannot hope anymore for European integration. 13 Malagodi likewise emphasized the political importance of the Six and drew attention to the Cold War context of the Common Market, which had been discussed at length at previous Bilderberg meetings: The community is coming to represent in [terms of ] political feeling, and I would like to underscore the word ‘feeling’ of the 6 countries, certainly of our own country, something which is irreplaceable. If to - morrow we were confronted with a breakdown of the community, we would all feel that something very dangerous was happening to each of our countries. We are under tremendous pressure from the East; alto - gether at our Eastern frontier, and in the case of some of us, the French and ourselves, also internally. The community does represent today the feeling of many of our people, the ultimate guarantee, internal guaran - tee, against that. 14 Van der Beugel acknowledged the political importance of the Six but warned that the French attitude carried grave dangers for the future of the European community. In a community of six nations, he argued, certain compromises were necessary; however, it was not acceptable for one of its members to continuously impose its will on the other five. As Van der Beugel put it: the compromises we have reached until now are compromises which have asked very much from those partners in the 6 who are very positive towards the Free Trade Zone and the moment may come, if that is going on, that the life of the community itself may be in danger. 15 Other FTA proponents, including Maudling, Gaitskell, and Ohlin, added that the political and economic consequence of failure would be dramatic. Gaitskell warned that Great Britain would likely form its own free trade area if the Six refused to compromise."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"208 The return of nationalism J ean Rey, reflecting the difficult position the newly founded European Commission found itself in, called for patience and understanding for the French position. The Commission was responsible for coming up with a plan for future negotiations in April, but it could ill-afford to start a fight with one of the most powerful members of the Six before it had really started functioning. Meanwhile the German participants found themselves in be - tween the two fronts, calling for a pragmatic approach. Although the enlarged steering committee meeting did not bring a solu - tion to the FTA controversy any nearer, it did result in several new diplo - matic channels: Jean Rey proposed informal discussions between Maudling and the Commission and Van der Beugel and Müller-Armack promised to keep each other informed about their dealings with the Commission. 16 “I have just come back from Paris,” Retinger told Johnson, “where I had long talks with Pinay and Baumgartner about our last meeting. They both think that it will prove to be helpful and Maudling thinks that some pro - gress is being made.” 17 Perhaps the most important result of the meeting, however, was a crystal - lization of attitudes concerning the European implications of President de Gaulle’s return to power. Ernst van der Beugel’s report on the meeting for Minister Luns was particularly revealing. After emphasizing that the dis - cussions had been more open and informal than would have been possible at an official gathering, Van der Beugel expressed grave worries about the French position regarding Europe: I have come to the conclusion that France has attached itself to the Eu rope of the Six, not because it wants integration, but because it wants to achieve leadership of this group. Villiers and Professor Aron, who are both close to the government, have left absolutely no room for misun - derstanding about this. Van der Beugel was convinced that France had no intention of accepting the FTA even if every single one of her economic demands was granted. The European Commission would support Paris because of the political importance of the Europe of the Six – the “European mysticism,” in Van der Be ugel’s words. Ironically, however, “the French government will never agree to a form of political integration that is acceptable to the other part - ners. Only a political integration under complete French leadership.” Ambassador Quaroni, Van der Beugel wrote, had confirmed this analy - sis, saying “we, Italians, Germans and Dutchmen have to choose between integration under French hegemony or no integration at all.” Van der Beugel added that there was little hope for support from Bonn, since Adenauer “no longer pays attention to any advice and will, so it is expected, accept every French condition as long as the Europe of the Six exists.” Van der Beugel concluded that The Hague had to prepare for an extremely difficult period in European affairs. He emphasized that to him personally “the Europe of"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"The return of nationalism 209 t he Six as an instrument of French hegemony is completely unacceptable.” Finally, Van der Beugel pointed out that all political life beneath President De Gaulle had ceased to exist and called the French Fifth Republic an “ab - solute monarchy without the mistresses.” 18 Van der Beugel’s report is significant not just because he would soon suc - ceed Retinger as secretary general of the Bilderberg Group, but also because it already contained the essential arguments and positions that would later fuel the Dutch opposition to de Gaulle’s proposal for a confederal Eur opean political organization. This so-called Fouchet Plan – named after the French negotiator Christian Fouchet – ultimately failed in 1962, largely because of suspicions in The Hague and Brussels about de Gaulle’s intentions and his authoritarianism. 19 Van der Beugel, who remained close to Luns after re - turning to private life in 1959, and many other Dutch diplomats thought that the alliance between the pro-Europeans and General de Gaulle was a marriage of convenience, which would only last as long as the deep-seated political differences between the two groups could be ignored. The long- term Gaullist political design, they were convinced, was fundamentally in - compatible with the integrative aims of the pro-Europeans. Fritz Berg returned from the meeting a little less pessimistic than Van der Beugel. He told the BDI Präsidium that his proposal for a flexible solution to the FTA problem had been well received. 20 Peter Tennant, on the other hand, broadly shared Van der Beugel’s views, telling Maudling that neither the French nor the Commission would agree to a compromise solution ac - ceptable to the UK. Tennant underlined the essentially political nature of the problem, writing: “[t]he Rome Treaty is a political document disguised in economic jargon.” Based on the Bilderberg discussions, he concluded that there remained a “deep suspicion” on the continent that the British were “merely paying lip-service to European unity.” 21 Therefore, any British pressure on the Five or threats of British economic reprisals against France only served to rally the Six together. 22 “There seems to be little doubt,” Tennant continued, that with de Gaulle in the position of a benevolent despot in France he is the only man who can exert any influence at all. His Ministers and Civil Servants are treated as lackeys and are expected to do what they are told, even if it involves sudden changes of policy. 23 Given the political nature of the problem, a meeting between Macmillan and de Gaulle might be the only way to produce a solution. If no progress turned out to be possible, the UK should first disengage temporarily in order to build up its own economic activity and put additional pressure on the Six. At the same time, the UK should attempt to create a wedge between the Commis - sion and the member governments of the EEC. “Personally,” Tennant told Retinger ten days later, “I think the auguries are now fairly hopeful and there now seems every chance of a meeting between Macmillan and de Gaulle.” 24"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"210 The return of nationalism T he assessments by Van der Beugel and Tennant carried several impli - cations for all diplomatic dealings with France. First, any negotiation in - volving Frenchmen other than de Gaulle would always be subject to sudden reversals or changes depending on the general’s attitude. Second, the weak - ness of democratic political life in the Fifth Republic was bound to be re - sented by France’s Western partners in the long run. For now, many in the West accepted de Gaulle because he was widely judged to be the only one capable of bringing the Algerian war to an end. But this could not be ex - pected to last forever. Bilderberg and the Gaullist challenge to NATO For the Bilderberg Group, the French situation posed a serious problem. If political life under de Gaulle had ceased to exist, as Van der Beugel put it, then how could France continue to make a serious contribution to the Bilderberg meetings? Moreover, French interest in the Bilderberg Group seemed to have declined considerably since de Gaulle had become presi - dent. At the same time, President de Gaulle had been remarkably successful in raising France’s international standing as a result of his much-noted state visits to Great Britain and the United States in April 1960, his insistence on equal treatment within NATO, and his unruffled handling of the 1960 Paris Summit (not to mention the first major French nuclear explosion in February). De Gaulle’s first challenge to NATO had come in September 1958, when he secretly proposed a tripartite Franco-British-American directorate in NATO to Eisenhower and Macmillan. De Gaulle wished both to achieve recognition of France’s global interests and to end the American de facto control of NATO nuclear policy. 25 He was not prepared to accept anything less than equal status of France in the alliance. Moreover, he expressed his fundamental opposition to military integration in NATO. De Gaulle main - tained in his memoirs that the September memorandum was the first move in a process of disengaging France from NATO in order to restore her free - dom of action. Whatever de Gaulle’s exact motives in 1958, his memorandum inevitably caused great consternation within NATO. The fact that he sent the West Germans and Italians versions of the memorandum that were different – and less offensive – than the original only increased the opposition of these and other, smaller NATO members to de Gaulle’s plans. 26 President Ei senhower, however, was in fact willing to go quite far in accommodating de Gaulle’s wishes. In December 1959, the president even agreed to hold secret tripartite meetings. 27 He also indicated that the US was prepared to assist the French nuclear program. Yet Eisenhower’s hands were tied by Congress and internal divisions within his administration. The JAEC vetoed an American offer to sell France a nuclear-powered submarine. Moreover, by late 1959 both the State"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"The return of nationalism 211 D epartment and General Norstad strongly opposed giving bilateral nuclear aid to France. De Gaulle’s record, after all, seemed to indicate that such aid would not secure a more positive French attitude towards NATO. In the summer of 1958, de Gaulle had refused the deployment of intermediate- ra nge ballistic missiles on French soil if they were not at least partly under exclusive French control. In March 1959, the French president announced the withdrawal of the Mediterranean fleet from NATO’s integrated com - mand. Later that year, he declined to give approval to the stockpiling of US nuclear weapons in France – forcing Norstad to remove all Am erican fighter planes from France – and refused to participate in NATO’s integrated air defense system. Dulles’ prediction of a “rough time” for the alliance had been right on the mark. A new team of Bilderberg organizers now had to deal with the ques - tion of French participation after Retinger’s retirement in 1959. At the 1959 Bi lderberg in Ye ş ilköy, Turkey, the steering committee unanimously accepted Prince Bernhard’s proposal to ask Ernst van der Beugel to be Re tinger’s successor in the role of honorary secretary general. 28 As Rijkens told Healey: We all know how difficult it will be to replace [Retinger], and also how few people there are who can approximately approach Joseph’s merits in the Bilderberg set-up. It was therefore something like general relief when Mr. van der Beugel accepted the nomination. 29 Van der Beugel had earned his stripes as a diplomat in the 1940s working on the Marshall Plan and the founding of the OEEC, and he remained a com - mitted Atlanticist for the rest of his life. 30 He had also been deeply involved in the Rome Treaties negotiations and was convinced that the Europe of the Six should develop as a liberal, outward-looking group. His resulting critical attitude towards Gaullist France was evident at the 1959 steering commit - tee meeting. Van der Beugel left government in 1959 and joined KLM as a vice-president. After four not altogether successful years at KLM, Van der Beugel decided to leave and combined his Bilderberg activities with a pro - fessorship in Atlantic Studies at Leiden University. Van der Beugel was much less of a Europeanist than Retinger, with his long history in the European Movement. This probably explains why Retinger, who would have preferred Van Kleffens to Van der Beugel as his successor, was not happy about the decision to move the Bilderberg secretariat from London to the Netherlands and to replace his assistant Pomian with an - other Dutch diplomat: Arnold Lamping, a former ambassador in Bonn. 31 Re tinger’s attempt to prevent these changes failed, however, after Prince Bernhard asked him rather sternly to refrain from further involvement. 32 In terms of personality, Van der Beugel was certainly a worthy successor to Retinger, with a similarly well-developed sense of humor, a deep love of culture (opera in particular), and a talent for dinner-table story telling. As"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"212 The return of nationalism h is friend Kissinger wrote about him upon Van der Beugel’s retirement from Bilderberg in 1980: “I know no one who is a more reliable human being, a steadier companion, a more charming conversationalist.” Prince Bernhard called him “perfect for this difficult job, thanks to his outstanding talents, his great enthusiasm, and his gift to inspire and stimulate people – the right man on the right place.” 33 The 1960 Bilderberg conference at the Bürgenstock near Luzern, Sw itzerland (May 28–29), was the first to be organized by Van der Beugel and Lamping, and they immediately faced the problem of French participa - tion. 34 Since Mollet and Pinay no longer played an active role in the steer - ing committee, Wilfrid Baumgartner was the main Bilderberger responsible for suggesting French participants. However, because Baumgartner had just become minister of finance, he had little time to assist the Bilderberg organizers. Lamping, frustrated after weeks of not being able to get hold of Baumgartner, noted in early May that only two Frenchmen had participated in the last two Bilderberg conferences and called the “decline of French in - terest remarkable.” This was unfortunate, he thought, because the prestige of de Gaulle – and therefore of France – has grown considerably in recent weeks and no international problem can profita- bly be discussed without hearing the voice of France. If we will have to accept another weak French delegation this year, this will be more wor - risome than in past years when France wasn’t taken fully seriously. 35 On the other side of the Atlantic, Heinz and Ball too had expressed their concerns about French participation in the upcoming conference. As Lamp - ing put it: we may personally lament what is going on in France, we may think of de Gaulle’s behavior and policies whatever we want; politically and strategically France remains a decisive factor on the world stage. Our American friends are completely right when they point to the eminent importance for the Bilderberg-combination tied to a strong and repre - sentative French participation. 36 In the Federal Republic, Wolff and Mueller agreed that it would be “point - less” to continue the Bilderberg meetings without French participation. 37 In the end, after the Dutch Ambassador in Paris, former Minister of Fo reign Affairs Beyen, intervened with de Gaulle personally, French participation in the Bürgenstock conference was acceptable. Frequent Bi lderbergers Aron, Baumgartner, and Piette were joined by first-time par - ticipant George Pompidou, a Gaullist close to the French president. 38 Still, the problem of French participation would continue to trouble the Bi lderberg organizers in years to come. In addition to a certain Gaullist reluctance"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"The return of nationalism 213 t o engage in transatlantic meetings, French political sensitivity seemed to be part of the problem. As Lamping noted: “The French shouldn’t get the impression that they will be faced with a crushing Anglo-Saxon majority, in the face of which even their continental friends will melt away: this in itself would suffice to annoy the French.” 39 The Bürgenstock conference, May 1960 The first part of the Bürgenstock conference was devoted to the failed East- West Summit in Paris, broken off by Khrushchev ostensibly because of the shooting down of an American U-2 spy plane over Soviet territory a week earlier. C. D. Jackson acknowledged that the Eisenhower Administration had botched the public relations aspect of the U-2 affair, calling it “unfor - tunate” that the President initially denied knowledge of the U-2 overflight. Tongue slightly in cheek, Jackson explained the episode by saying that “for a whole variety of reasons, we [Americans] suffer from a boy scout complex and there is nothing more distressing than when a boy scout is caught in the jam closet.” On a more serious note, Jackson argued that the real reason for the Su mmit’s failure had been that Khrushchev had recognized that the Wes ter n position on Berlin was firm: “he wanted to come back to Moscow with a Berlin concession from us, and when he discovered that that was not likely to take place, the summit became very unattractive to him.” The U-2 incident simply “furnished him with a gold plated excuse having tremendous prop - aganda advantages, which he could use to torpedo the summit.” President Eisenhower, meanwhile, was “terribly disappointed, terribly hurt and terri - bly angry.” In the last phase of his presidency, Jackson argued, Eisenhower “really deep in his heart wanted to emerge, wanted to leave the White House as a President who had really brought some kind of peace to the world.” 40 Opinions at the Bilderberg meeting were divided over how to judge Mr. K. – as Khrushchev was called, almost affectionately, in the confer - ence report. NATO Secretary General Spaak mentioned his recent talk with Yu goslav leader Tito, who was convinced that Khrushchev had to deal with substantial opposition to his leadership in Moscow. Spaak also thought that the fact that it took Khrushchev a week to respond to the U-2 affair indicated that he initially hoped to prevent a breakdown of relations with Ei sen hower. Apparently under pressure from Soviet hardliners, Kh rushchev was forced to change tactics after Eisenhower took full responsibility for the U-2 over - flights in a press conference. Spaak added that he thought Khrushchev was something of a communist heretic, more pragmatic than ideological. In terms of the West’s posture towards the Soviet Union, this meant, Spaak argued, that firmness should be combined with a certain flexibility. 41 Several speakers agreed with this assessment, but others, including Ra ymond Aron, voiced doubts and maintained that Khrushchev’s aims were broadly the same as Stalin’s. Pierre Dupuy reported the impression of"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"214 The return of nationalism m any diplomats in Paris that Khrushchev was a sick and tired man. Some even speculated that he might be gone in a few months’ time. Again, Aron sounded a note of caution, reminding everyone that Khrushchev was still in the driving seat and that the “temperature of Cold War is a function of what Mr. K. wants.” Heilperin contributed the view that Khrushchev had “out-promised” himself in the domestic field – he could not deliver the in - crease in living standards promised to the Soviet people, so what better way to retreat than “stepping up the cold war.” 42 With respect to future Soviet tactics in the Berlin question, Pietro Qu aroni and Carlo Schmid both warned that the Berlin problem would not go away by itself and that a new Soviet initiative was only a matter of time. C. D. Jackson agreed and delivered a typical call for common action: there is no question but that there is going to be another [Soviet] move. The West has fallen into the habit of scoring points by getting out of tight fixes, heaving a great sigh of relief, and then going off to have a Martini at 5.30. That 5.30 whistle never blows in the Kremlin, and these gentlemen are hard at work at the moment preparing the next ‘sale coup’ which is sure to come and probably very soon. 43 Jackson blamed the West as a whole, but many participants at Bürgenstock thought that a primary cause for Western weakness was a lack of American leadership. Denis Healey said so openly and was only opposed by Robert Mu r phy. The second day of the conference was reserved exclusively for the rift be - tween the Six and the UK-led Seven. After the final breakdown of the FTA negotiations in March 1959, the British had decided to organize the Seven into a counter-group to put pressure on the Six. The European Free Trade Area (EFTA), which also included Austria, Denmark, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, and Switzerland, was up and running by the time of the Bürgen - stock meeting. The schism in Europe many had feared was now a reality. The proponents of the Common Market, however, were unapologetic at Bürgenstock. If anything, they were on the offensive. Paul-Henri Spaak and Robert Marjolin, now a member of the Commis - sion in Brussels, put forward several arguments in favor of the Six and did so in the strongest possible terms. Supported by other pro-Europeans such as the Dutch politician Pieter Blaisse (KVP), they emphasized three points. First, contrary to what Great Britain might have hoped and expected, the EEC “was now an accomplished, irreversible fact” – as the Bürgenstock report put it. The fact that the Commission had proposed plans for an ac - celeration of the transition to the Common Market had proven that the Six were determined to proceed quickly. In other words, attempts by the Bri tish to dissolve the EEC in a wider European trade area could not succeed. Se cond, the political aspect of the European C ommunities was crucial. The Six should be regarded as the nucleus of a politically united Europe open to"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"The return of nationalism 215 ot her countries. The political nature of the EEC was embodied in the fact that the Rome Treaties “were an indissoluble whole.” The common external tariff was “only one element of a vast political, economic and social system, from which it could not be detached.” 44 Spaak in particular underlined this point, calling the Rome Treaty a “stage in the movement toward European unification” and attacking the position of the Seven as “fundamentally and radically false.” 45 Finally, they defended the EEC against the often-heard accusation that it was a protectionist, inward-looking bloc. They empha- sized that the Six were not only committed to the reduction of trade imped - iments, but also welcomed any new members. The American delegation at Bürgenstock mainly supported the Marjolin- Sp aak line. The American rapporteur on the topic – probably George Ball – explained that the Common Market had been hailed in the United States as an important step toward a politically unified Europe. “On the other hand, the European Free Trade Association did not represent the same aspiration, at least not in the political field, and this had led to a certain American hes - itation with regard to it.” 46 Edward M. Martin, who was shortly to become assistant secretary of state for Economic and Business Affairs, highlighted the importance of lowering trade barriers in view of the US balance of pay - ment deficit of the last two years. The United States would either have to increase its exports or diminish its expenditures abroad. As a result, Martin said, both the EEC and EFTA would be pressured to further open their markets to American products, as well as to conform to GATT rules. More - over, to strengthen the economic ties between Europe and North America, the United States and Canada would join the OEEC countries in the Organ - ization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) which was to replace the OEEC. 47 By all accounts, the Bürgenstock discussion of the Six and the Seven was extremely frank. After the conference, Jackson told Prince Bernhard, who had spent the second day of the conference sick in bed: I am sure that you got a report about the fascinating discussion on the Six and the Seven. It was so good that I would not be a bit surprised if this particular Bilderberg did indeed affect history, inasmuch as both sides heard some very plain and forceful truth to which they appeared to be paying considerable attention. 48 Eelco van Kleffens was also impressed. In a letter to the President of the ECSC, he reported that the Americans were clearly in favor of the Six. “For the case of the Seven,” he wrote, “it was a bad day.” 49 Another report on the meeting was written by Kurt Birrenbach, a first- time Bilderberg participant. Birrenbach was a prominent member of the CDU and an industrialist with close ties to Krupp and the BDI. 50 He was ac - complished at international networking, an active member of the DGAP and someone frequently used by the Bonn government for discreet diplomatic"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"216 The return of nationalism m issions abroad. Birrenbach favored a flexible solution to Europe’s trade difficulties and was obviously shaken by the Bürgenstock discussion. He sent his notes to Adenauer, Foreign Minister Heinrich von Brentano and others, writing: The speeches by Marjolin and Spaak, as well as to a lesser degree some of the other interventions by participants from the Six, showed an attitude towards the solution of the European trade problem that could not be detected before. Marjolin rejected the idea of a Free Trade Area in the strongest possible way, even on the basis of participation by the EEC as a whole, and demanded a similar political goal as a nonnegotiable justifica - tion for association with the common market. Spaak went even further, both in the sharpness of the manner in which he presented his thoughts, and in the explicit way in which he demanded the acceptance of full po - litical integration in return for the solution of the European trade issue. 51 In general, two conclusions could be drawn from the Bürgenstock discus - sion. First, the British had obviously failed in their attempts to force a purely economic solution to the European trade problem. Despite strong support for a free trade area in several member states of the EEC, there could be lit - tle doubt that the Six remained intent on forging an economic and political union. The Bürgenstock meeting also confirmed that the Six could count on strong support from the United States in this respect. The Americans treated the EEC as an entirely different entity than the Bri tish-led EFTA. No doubt this led to fears in the UK that the special relationship with the United States was in danger of crumbling with the advent of a strong, united grouping on the continent. 52 To make matters worse – from the Bri tish pe rspective – the unholy alliance between pro-Europeans and Gaullists showed no signs of faltering. The second conclusion followed logically. In these circumstances, the only way to overcome the economic split in Europe was for the United Kingdom either to become a full or an associate member of the EEC. This was exactly what Frederick M. Bennett, a conservative MP and Maudling’s principal assistant, took away from the meeting. Bennett indicated privately during the Bürgenstock conference that London was ready to accept the political purpose of the EEC. He told Kurt Birrenbach that the British were willing to consider an associate membership along the lines sketched by Bi rrenbach in his response to Spaak’s statement. Birrenbach had opposed Spaak’s po - sition with regard to a political entrance fee for British participation in the Common Market. Instead of full membership, Birrenbach argued, the UK should only accept the harmonization of most tariffs, the inclusion of ag - riculture, and the coordination of trade and economic policy. Some kind of institutional framework could then be found, which would allow the Six to deepen their political cooperation and which would allow the British to maintain their special relationship with the Commonwealth countries. 53"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"The return of nationalism 217 B ennett’s interest in Birrenbach’s proposals was an indication of the change in British thinking that took place around this time. Shortly after the Bürgenstock conference, both The Economist and The Observer spoke out in favor of full British membership in the EEC. 54 Meanwhile, a high- level review of Britain’s European policy, headed by Permanent Secretary at the Treasury Sir Frank Lee, had reached the conclusion that the UK could not afford to remain aloof from the Europe of the Six. 55 As a result of his Bürgenstock conversations with Bennett, Birrenbach traveled to London in early July, for meetings with Maudling, Bennett, Ormsby-Gore, and others. It is unclear whether Adenauer specifically asked Birrenbach to undertake this mission to London, but Birrenbach kept the chancellor fully informed. 56 As he told Adenauer after his visit, the Ma cmillan Government was moving in the direction of closer ties with Europe. Prime Minister Macmillan was still undecided, but members of the Conservative Party and several high-placed officials in the Foreign Office were interested in his proposal. 57 When the British government announced on July 25 that it recognized the impossibility of negotiating a simple Europe-wide FTA, Adenauer quickly indicated that West Germany favored preliminary discussions with Lo ndon on several of the outstanding problems, including agriculture and the Commonwealth. Yet the German-British rapprochement – partly based on Adenauer’s increasing doubts about the reliability of both de Gaulle and the United States – was rather short-lived. 58 By early 1961 it was clear that neither France nor the European Commission were willing to consider an association of Great Britain with the Common Market. The coup de grâce to Birrenbach’s association scheme was delivered by none other than George Ball. After John F. Kennedy’s election victory in November 1960, Ball had been named under secretary of state for Economic Affairs. Ball’s intimate knowledge of the European scene quickly made him the point man responsible for most European questions in the Kennedy Ad ministration, and he was soon promoted to the number-two spot in the State Department. The fact that Ball and the new Secretary of State, Dean Rusk, were “Bilderberg brothers” enabled them to quickly develop a good working relationship. 59 Ball now pushed through an important change in American policy to - wards the Six and the Seven. In March 1961, he was in London for a meeting of the Development Assistance Group (DAG), an organization in spired by the frequent Bilderberg discussions concerning the Third World and set up by the OECD members with the aim of increasing and coordinating Western development aid. While in London, Ball also met with Edward Heath and Frank Lee, two of the top officials responsible for British pol - icy towards Europe. They asked Ball point-blank whether the Kennedy Ad ministration was in favor of Great Britain joining the Co mmon Ma rket. As Ball later recalled, “this was the first time the qu estion had ever been raised in those terms and there was no such thing as an American policy"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"218 The return of nationalism on the issue.” 60 Nonetheless, Ball answered in the affirmative. If Britain was prepared to become a full member and accept the political aspira - tions of the Six, he said, the United States would regard this as a welcome strengthening of the West. To Ball’s delight, his straightforward talk with Heath and Lee showed immediate effect. During Macmillan’s first official meeting with President Kennedy in early April 1961, Britain’s relations with Europe and the United States stood high on the agenda. 61 Kennedy had approved the position Ball had taken in London and now left it to Ball to explain US policy to Ma cmillan. Ball repeated his views about the political importance of full British membership. He argued that it was uncertain what would happen in West Germany and France after Adenauer and de Gaulle left the scene. Therefore, it was highly desirable that the United Kingdom would “help cement the German ties to the West and provide cohesion.” 62 Macmillan asked and received assurances from President Kennedy and Ball that British membership in the EEC would not harm British rela - tions with the United States. In reply, the president emphasized that he regarded British membership as an important step towards a more viable At lantic Community. 63 During dinner the following evening, Macmillan took Ball aside and told him: “we are going to do this thing.” It would not be easy – Macmillan expected major trouble from de Gaulle – but he was now determined to apply for British membership. Ball used the 1961 Bilderberg meeting in Canada two weeks later to underline the attitude of the Ke nnedy Administration towards the EEC-EFTA issue. In a fifteen- mi nute tour d’ horizon , he explained that the United States regarded EFTA as a group “d evoid of political overtones” and was in favor of “the largest possible number of the Seven joining the Common Market. That would be a very helpful step.” 64 The Kennedy Administration For obvious reasons, President Kennedy’s election in November 1960 drew much attention in Bilderberg circles. A key feature of the Bilderberg Group – namely that a sizeable number of its participants were drawn from those not currently in power – seemed to have paid off: several influential new members of the Kennedy Administration were (former) Bilderbergers, from Secretary of State Dean Rusk to George Ball, Paul Nitze (who became assis - tant secretary of defense for International Security Affairs at the Pentagon), George McGhee (who first headed the Policy Planning staff and later be - came ambassador to Germany), and National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy. Dean Acheson and Henry Kissinger, moreover, served as advisors on NATO and the Berlin crisis. Whether the new administration would succeed in providing the kind of leadership in the alliance that had been missing in the final Eisenhower"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"The return of nationalism 219 y ears was a different matter. As Lamping wrote, many Europeans had noted with some trepidation that many of the “new men” seemed to have a markedly greater interest in the United Nations and the uncom - mitted countries than was the case during the Eisenhower Administra - tion. It has been noted that during the campaign, Kennedy talked little of the relationship with Europe, and much more about the underdeveloped nations. 65 This could easily exacerbate existing transatlantic disagreements over de - colonization. As Van der Beugel had told Johnson just before the presiden - tial election: I think that one of the basic problems now is that there is a general feel - ing in Europe (not, repeat not shared by me personally) that Europe suf - fers from the ambiguity of the U.S. foreign policy towards its Eur opean partners: support in Europe; no support in the rest of the world. This brings us approximately to the topic of global U.S. responsibilities, compatible or not compatible with its European alliance. 66 The 1961 Bilderberg conference in St. Castin, Canada, provided an impor - tant opportunity for the Kennedy Administration to present itself to the in - formal alliance. 67 In Healey’s view, “The Americans were clearly anxious to use the meeting for a trial run of some of the new Administration’s ideas.” 68 Leon Fuller of the State Department’s Policy Planning Staff prepared a gen - eral memorandum on the agenda of the St. Castin meeting and argued that there was no alternative to an effective Atlantic community to counter the Soviet-Sino threat and to deal with the challenge of the developing nations. Apart from the economic and military strength of the Atlantic nations, Fuller emphasized the importance of shared values within the alliance. “We have a priceless asset,” he wrote, in the natural, historically derived, affinity of the Western nations for each other and in their sense of being a real community. Despite all obstacles, this makes possible to an exceptional degree a common view - point and common policies in international affairs. 69 These shared values, however, were not in evidence during the Bay of Pigs debacle that unfolded just days before the Bilderberg meeting and pre - vented Rusk and McGhee from coming to St. Castin. Healey was particu - larly galled over the American-sponsored intervention in Cuba. He and Gaitskell had spent considerable political capital in trying to convince the Labour Party that the Kennedy Administration was different from previous Am erican administrations and should be cooperated with. 70 At St. Castin,"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"220 The return of nationalism H ealey said the invasion violated the UN Charter, drew a parallel with the Suez crisis, and emphasized that the effect on the alliance and particularly on the developing world was disastrous. The Kennedy Administration had shown that in its “sphere of influence,” the United States felt entitled “to overthrow governments of which they disapproved.” How could the alliance be expected to follow American leadership, he asked, if the US showed such poor judgment? 71 Baron Snoy et d’Oppuers, an influential Belgian civil servant, presciently argued that the failure of the invasion had strengthened the Soviet posi - tion and invited dangerous counteractions. Earl Jellicoe, a British conserv - ative MP, regretted the lack of consultation on Cuba and asked whether there should not be more consultation on another area of great concern: So utheast Asia. The American participants acknowledged, in the words of Democratic Senator Mike Monroney, the “body blow to U.S. prestige.” 72 At the same time, they tried to play down the extent of American involvement. Joseph Johnson rejected the comparison with Suez by pointing out that no Americans were involved in the invasion. In addition, several Am erican participants pointed to the danger of the Communist takeover in Cuba, which might spread to other countries in Latin America. In a one sense the comparison with Suez was valid: like the Suez crisis, the Cuban invasion proved again how difficult the out-of-area problem was for NATO. Not surprisingly, therefore, the St. Castin discussion of “the role of N.A.T.O. in the world policy of the member countries” was as inconclusive as earlier Bilderberg debates. Lester B. Pearson, the leader of the Canadian Liberal Party, started off the discussion on this point. The fact that the Cold War battlegrounds had shifted from Europe to Asia and Africa created dif - ficulties, he argued, aggravated by the global disruptions of the decoloniza - tion process. Because of the “bedeviling influence of colonialism,” 73 Pearson said, certain countries “were pro-Atlantic in Paris but not in New York.” 74 The troubles in Angola, Algeria and the Congo divided the NATO member states in the United Nations, and Pearson foresaw no improvement as long as the colonial question remained unsolved. Most participants agreed that apart from better consultation, there was little that could be done. In contrast, Olivier Guichard, a Gaullist member of the French National Assembly, argued for the establishment of a three-power organization within NATO, consisting of France, Great Britain and the United States, to deal with global issues. He argued that this was not an attempt to establish a ‘directorate,’ as was often said, but simply recognition of France’s interests outside NATO. Not surprisingly, the strongest opposition to Guichard’s attempt to re - vive de Gaulle’s September 1958 memorandum came from the Bilderberg participants of the smaller NATO members. An unidentified Canadian par - ticipant thought that what Guichard described sounded very much like a directorate. Snoy et d’Oppuers maintained that such a directorate would be “worse for the small countries than imperfect consultation in NATO,” and"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"The return of nationalism 221 t he Dutch Social-Democrat and former Minister of Justice Ivo Samkalden pointedly inquired how Guichard’s proposal for a directorate was compati - ble with the close association between France and Germany. 75 As Lamping summarized the St. Castin discussion in his notes: The French argued that N.A.T.O. cooperation in Europe would depend on its members coordinating their policies in other parts of the world and in the United Nations. The impact of this argument was weakened by their incompromising [sic] insistence that France could not cooper - ate effectively even in N.A.T.O.’s strategic tasks in Europe unless she obtained assistance from the U.S.A. in producing her own atomic strik - ing force. Participants from all the other European states both great and small (and Canada) rejected the French proposal for a Three Power Political Directorate in N.A.T.O., though some of the British believed it might be desirable and possible to arrange for some sort of N.A.T.O. In ner Cabinet in which the Great Powers were permanently present while the smaller powers took turns. 76 Beyond the discussion of out-of-area issues, the Bilderberg meeting sug - gested two main conclusions about the new Kennedy Administration. First, the administration seemed determined to decrease NATO’s reliance on nu - clear weapons for its defense through a strategy of flexible response. Second, the new president wished to start a serious attempt to negotiate an effective disarmament agreement with the Soviet Union. The Ford Foundation’s Shepard Stone, a long-time associate of John Mc Cloy, informed the Bilderberg participants about the efforts of the Ke nnedy Administration in the field of disarmament. McCloy had just been named advisor to the president on disarmament, and Stone left no doubt that Washington was serious about trying to make progress on disar - mament. “I can not emphasize too much,” Stone said, “the fact that those dealing with disarmament in Washington are deeply attached to the NATO alliance. But exposed to the overall problem of the arms competition, they believe that we must try to find solutions in the disarmament area.” In his Bilderberg presentation, which was printed in the final report, Stone gave a detailed overview of the various problems involved in disarmament and the present state of the test ban negotiations. He urged the Eur opean participants to develop their own thinking on these matters because We stern Europe seemed to trail the United States in this respect. A strong argument in favor of disarmament was that it would make resources avail - able “for peaceful purposes.” Stone ended with an appeal for more Western self-confidence: Some of the speakers said here, and this seems to me to be essential, that we ought not be afraid of Soviet competition in the peaceful area. If the Western nations, 500–600 million strong, with their great resources,"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"222 The return of nationalism t alents and skills, are not convinced, as they should be, that they can win the competition with the Communist states in the non-military area, then indeed we are going to lose out. We have every reason to have confidence in ourselves. It must be the assumption of this group that it is in the Atlantic Community – if we put together the Community’s re sources – that we really have the answer to the Communist challenge. 77 The question of NATO nuclear strategy took up the largest part of the dis - cussion at St. Castin. Many of the arguments were familiar to those who had participated in the Bilderberg conferences at the time of the Sputnik shock, but an important difference was the rapid developments in US rocket tech - nology. Lamping noted that July 1960 represented an important milestone with the launching of the first solid-fuel Polaris missile. Although the Po laris missiles were expensive and had a range of only about 2,000 ki lometers, they had one overwhelming advantage: they could be launched from submarines. Combined with the successful testing of the Minuteman ICBM (range: 6,500 kilometers), the United States would soon no longer be dependent on Eu ropean bases for the effectiveness of its nuclear deterrent. Lamping won - dered whether this development “will make Europe less important to the United States’ strategy with far-reaching consequences for the international political realm.” 78 On the American side, an impressive group of experts was present to an - swer this question, including Christian Herter , Paul Nitze , Isidor I. Rabi, the former chairman of the General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission , and Albert Wohlstetter, a RAND Corporation ana - lyst. Nitze and Wohlstetter had been involved in the drafting of the Acheson Report, which provided the basis for Kennedy’s NATO policy; Wo hlstetter, moreover, had just published an influential article in Foreign Affairs on “N uclear Sharing: N.A.T.O. and the N + 1 Country.” 79 Wohlstetter opposed Ei senhower’s policy of nuclear sharing and argued that unified control of the nuclear deterrent was safer than a proliferation of national nuclear forces. For the same reason, he opposed the creation of a NATO nuclear force. 80 Not surprisingly, Nitze also strongly argued in favor of less reliance on nuclear weapons in the defense of the West. He told the Bilderberg partici - pants that NATO’s conventional forces should be capable of holding NATO positions long enough “for significant political consultation within NATO, and long enough for the Soviets to reassess the effect upon themselves of our determination to react.” At the same time he reassured his European audi- ence that the new administration stood behind the US nuclear guarantee: “It is firmly determined that any nuclear attack upon a NATO power, or any major non-nuclear attack which involves, or presages, a determined Soviet effort, must be met by a full nuclear reply.” As soon as NATO’s territory was thus secured, Nitze argued, “we can then turn our major disposable energies to meeting the threat where it is most imminent, Asia, Africa and the Western Hemisphere.” 81"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"The return of nationalism 223 N ot all participants, however, were willing to leave the nuclear defense of Europe to the United States. French participants Olivier Guichard and General François Croisillier argued that France, as a world power, needed its own nuclear force and would insist on building it with or without US assistance. Guichard suggested that given existing arrangements for US– British nuclear cooperation, a similar deal with France would make sense in the context of a tripartite nuclear directorate. With such a solution, he suggested, the French attitude on NATO cooperation would become more positive. 82 On the question of increased conventional forces, most participants agreed that an effort to strengthen the NATO shield was necessary. Con - tinuing earlier attempts by NATO officials to influence Western opinion, Ra ymond Thurston, an aide to General Norstad, presented a paper on NATO strategy that again underlined the importance of a strong shield. 83 Some doubts were expressed, however, about the willingness of the member states to pay for this effort. The rest of the discussion focused on the role of tactical and strategic nuclear weapons. According to Earl Jellicoe, it was unrealistic to expect conventional forces alone to hold a major attack. In view of Nitze’s strong emphasis on non-nuclear forces, he also warned that the Soviet Union should not be given the impression that NATO had turned away from the use of nuclear weapons. This would undermine the credibility of the overall deterrent. Several participants wondered whether NATO could be given control over all tactical nuclear weapons in Europe. At present they were either controlled by American forces, or by a double veto of the United States and the European host country. If NATO had control over these weapons, however, the question was whether there would there be sufficient time for a collective decision. And would not fifteen fingers on the trigger undermine the credibility of the deterrent in Soviet eyes? 84 The Canadian Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, General Charles Foulkes, suggested that an ideal solution to the control problem was virtually impossible. “Perhaps,” he said, “fuzziness is the best solution.” 85 As in earlier discussions of nuclear weapons, a fundamental problem was whether one thought in terms of deterrence – preventing war – or in terms of fighting a war. In case of the former, the presence of tactical nuclear weap - ons was crucial both to strengthen the NATO shield and to force the Soviets to take into account the risk of a nuclear response to any aggression. If one started thinking about the actual occurrence of war, however, tactical nu - clear weapons seemed to pose great risks. Both Fritz Erler and Healey argued that tactical nuclear weapons should not be part of frontline forces. In case of attack, these forces might be quickly overwhelmed, putting them in the position of either giving up their weapons or using them. And most participants – including Herter, van Roijen, and Erler – agreed that it was highly likely that the use of tactical"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"224 The return of nationalism n uclear weapons would lead to general nuclear war. Rabi added that small nuclear weapons were expensive to develop compared to larger weapons. This raised the question of how Soviet forces were equipped. Rabi doubted whether they had at their disposal the same range of weapons as the United States. In other words, chances were that the Soviets would respond to tac - tical nuclear weapons by firing back big ones. 86 With respect to strategic nuclear weapons, there was a remarkably strong feeling that the United States should be responsible for their use. The St. Castin report was unambiguous on this point: As regards the use of the major deterrent, there was no difference of views among the speakers: the survival of the West in the face of the So viet peril depended on the Strategic Air Command, and only the United States could decide when to use that. Ultimately, it was a “question of the Allies’ trust in the wisdom of the United States Government, and it was up to the Americans to do everything possi - ble to justify that trust.” 87 In this context, the American suggestion to base several Polaris-armed submarines in European waters was welcomed by most participants. Herter, who had first made this proposal to the NATO Council in December 1960, explained that the primary purpose of the Polaris submarines was to show that part of the US strategic forces was “irrevocably committed to Europe.” The control question had been left undecided to give NATO the opportu - nity to discuss different scenarios. But with remarkable candor, Herter said that in his view, NATO should decide it was best that “we keep our finger on [the] trigger.” There could not be the slightest doubt, he added, that SAC would be used in defense of NATO if necessary. The only one who seriously questioned the American guarantee was General de Gaulle. 88 Visiting the White House after the St. Castin conference, Prince Bernhard briefed President Kennedy on the Bilderberg discussions and said that in his view, “there should not be a tripartite control over the use of nuclear weap - ons nor a 15-nation control through NAC, but rather he felt that the sole control should rest with the President of the United States.” 89 The smaller NATO countries, Prince Bernhard said, clearly preferred US control to the Gaullist suggestion of a tripartite directorate. Kennedy replied that he re - garded the Polaris proposals as a way of “discouraging the development of an independent nuclear capability on the part of the French and eventually the Germans.” 90 Meanwhile, the St. Castin report concluded that “none of the speakers threw any formal doubt on the value of the American guarantee, which had been reaffirmed by the new President.” Yet this ignored the problem of national nuclear forces in Europe. 91 Guichard and Croisillier had left little doubt that France would build its own nuclear force. This inevitably raised the question of whether West Germany would accept an inferior position"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"The return of nationalism 225 i n the alliance. The last-minute absence of two important German par - ticipants, State Secretary for Foreign Affairs Karl Carstens and Defense Minister Franz Josef Strauß, was part of the explanation for the relatively straightforward acceptance of US dominance in the nuclear field. 92 The only German politician able to speak with authority on nuclear strategy, Erler, was generally in agreement with the Kennedy Administration’s line on NATO and did not wish to see a greatly enhanced German role in the nuclear field. However, the Adenauer Government was unwilling to ac - cept long-term discrimination against the Federal Republic and strongly supported SACEUR General Norstad’s proposal to create an integrated NATO nuclear force – including land-based medium-range ballistic missiles (M RBMs) – not controlled by a veto of the American president. All in all, the relatively weak German presence at the St. Castin confer - ence was unfortunate, since a German-American crisis of confidence was very much in the making. 93 The Kennedy Administration’s reluctance to make NATO into the fourth nuclear power was understandable, but as Max Kohnstamm, one of the new Bilderberg participants in Canada, noted in his diary, it was imperative to prevent discrimination against West Germany in the nuclear field. Kohnstamm, who as Jean Monnet’s principal assistant in the Action Committee was an important player in the informal alliance, correctly foresaw that the German government would be reluctant to accept the United States’ more or less unilateral control of the nuclear deterrent and the reversal of Eisenhower’s policy of nuclear sharing. 94 Strauß was soon to become the strongest critic of the Kennedy Administration’s new NATO st rat eg y. President Kennedy did reaffirm Herter’s proposal to commit five Polaris submarines to NATO in a speech in Ottawa in May 1961. The president also mentioned “the possibility of eventually establishing a NATO sea- borne force, which would be truly multi-lateral in ownership and control.” Ho wever – and this was important – he added that NATO’s non-nuclear goals should be achieved first. 95 This was an unmistakable retreat from Herter’s offer, since it was unlikely that the non-nuclear build-up would be finished before 1966. It was clear, therefore, that for the moment President Kennedy saw the multilateral Polaris proposal mainly as a way to deflect attention from General Norstad’s continued calls for land-based MRBMs. Kennedy believed that the Europeans would be unable to come up with a feasible proposal for control of a multilateral force and would eventually decide to leave the strategic deterrent in the hands of the United States. 96 President Kennedy’s assessment, based on advice from Dean Acheson, was certainly plausible. Moreover, as long as the British membership negoti - ations with the EEC continued, the Kennedy Administration was reluctant to inject the nuclear issue into the mix. This meant, however, that the new administration provided strong arguments to all those who said that US leadership in the alliance amounted to unacceptable dominance.

The political rea - sons for American support for European unity were the same as in the mid- 1950s. Under Secretary of State C. Douglas Dillon told C. D. Jackson, who had sent Dillon a report on the Bürgenstock discussions: The U.S. has consistently and warmly supported the formation of a common market because of the political advantages which we see accruing from this organization, not the least of which is tying Germany to the West and helping to end the centuries-long strife between France and Germany. Such political advantages more than outweigh, in our view, the discrimination inherent in a customs union.

The crisis continued with the controversy over the Multilateral Force (MLF) and the European empty chair crisis, only to cul - minate in the French withdrawal from NATO’s military integration in 1966. Throughout these years, the Bilderberg organizers had to face a dilemma: on the one hand, they clearly saw a role for Bilderberg in responding to de Gaulle’s nationalism and his undermining of some of the basic internation - alist assumptions underlying the alliance; on the other hand, they realized that Bilderberg as an informal transatlantic forum could hardly function without a French contribution. All this led to emotional debates about the future of Europe and the al - liance and a decision by leading US officials to use the informal alliance to defend the American leadership position and to respond to the French accusation of hegemonic domination. In the end, no solutions were found to overcome the Gaullist-Atlanticist rift; at the same time, the much-feared disintegration of NATO did not come about. The French, moreover, de - spite their obvious dislike of being criticized in a transatlantic forum such as Bilderberg, never fully cut their ties to the informal alliance. Meanwhile, Germany became more and more important as a key voice in the strug - gle for the future of transatlantic relations. Without German support, after all, President de Gaulle’s ambitious plans for an independent Europe were doomed to failure. Another consequence of the transatlantic crisis was that the Bilderberg organizers realized they had to bring in new and younger participants into the group. In the face of strong movements in favor of nuclear disarmament, the rise of student activism, and the Vietnam War protests, the internation - alist Bilderberg consensus seemed to be under attack not just from Paris, but also from university campuses and protest marches around the globe. The Bi lderberg Group responded by bringing in new faces and by making a seri - ous, although not entirely successful, effort to understand the spirit of 1968. 9 Alliance in crisis"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"232 Alliance in crisis The 1962 Saltsjöbaden conference 1962 was a year of transition in transatlantic relations. Not long before the 1962 Bilderberg Conference in Saltsjöbaden, Sweden (May 18–20), Luns and Spaak rejected President de Gaulle’s plan for a confederal political Europe (the Fouchet Plan) after de Gaulle had unilaterally deleted references to the continued importance of NATO. The Dutch and Belgians feared not only French domination of the new structure, but also a weakening of the exist - ing institutions of Atlantic and European cooperation. On May 5, De Gaulle reacted with one of his famous press conferences – fulminating against a supranational Europe dominated by the United States as the external feder - ator. The five MRP ministers in his cabinet resigned in protest. For the first time, the Kennedy Administration decided to publicly respond. A day before the Saltsjöbaden conference, President Kennedy warned: We cannot and do not take any European ally for granted and I hope no one in Europe would take us for granted either [...] American public opinion has turned away from isolationism but its faith must not be shattered. 1 Further complicating the situation, however, was the fact that the British membership negotiations were still dragging on, and the US-Soviet Berlin negotiations had led to a serious crisis of confidence between Adenauer and Kennedy, involving German leaks of secret negotiating documents and the de facto US dismissal of the German ambassador in Washington. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara further added to transatlantic tensions with a speech at the NATO ministerial meeting in Athens in early May arguing that indivisibility of control was crucial in the nuclear deterrent and that small, independent nuclear forces were useless at best and dangerous at worst. At Saltsjöbaden, these developments overshadowed the first day’s discus - sion of the United Nations (which was “rather dull” in Erler’s view) and led to a renewed focus on the fact that despite Europe’s economic resurgence, a huge gap in military and technological power still existed between Europe and the United States. Max Kohnstamm was one of those strongly arguing in favor of an Atlantic partnership of equals to overcome the present diffi - culties. “A partnership of a large group of nations,” Kohnstamm argued, dominated by a single power or tied together by rules and institutions would always be weak and vacillating. Therefore, equal partnership be - tween a United Europe and the United States is the necessary prerequi - site for the strength and solidarity of the Atlantic Alliance. 2 Kohnstamm continued by arguing that the three fundamental tasks of the alliance – deterrence, to find a durable “modus vivendi” with the Sov iet Un ion, and to help the developing world – could only be reached if the West was closely united. “Such unity,” Kohnstamm argued, “depended on"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"Alliance in crisis 233 a n equal partnership between the United States and Europe.” Kohnstamm went to great length to emphasize that such a partnership should extend to the military field. He argued that this was the only way to counter the “idea of a third force” – meaning, of course, a Gaullist third force. 3 The practical problems of such an equal partnership, however, were evi - dent at Saltsjöbaden. In the first place, a successful completion of the Bri tish membership negotiations was a precondition, yet after de Gaulle’s most re - cent press conference, there was little cause for optimism. In addition, the question of how the rest of Europe would have to adjust to EEC enlargement remained unanswered. The Scandinavians were particularly anxious about this and were prominently present to make their case with, among others, Swedish Prime Minister Tage Erlander, Swedish Minister of Trade Gunnar Lange, Norwegian Foreign Minister Halvard Lange, Erik Boheman, Ole Bjørn Kraft, Bertil Ohlin, and Marcus Wallenberg. As Erler told Nitze: George Ball had a good case for Britain’s membership, but a bad one against the association of the European neutrals. In this problem he had just one companion: Mr. Kohnstamm from the Monnet team. All the other participants were in favor of finding a fair association for the European neutrals. Putting them back to the same status as Japan or Latin America in relation to Europe would not correspond either to their geographical position nor to their political sympathies and cul - tural heritage. 4 Many participants at Saltsjöbaden were worried that rather than an At lantic Partnership, “the formation of a Paris/Bonn axis” was more likely. An agree - ment between de Gaulle and Adenauer to keep the United Kingdom out of the European Community was generally felt to be unacceptable. Joseph Harsch, who participated in the Saltsjöbaden conference, reported two days later that George Ball was in Europe to tell Bonn that West Germany “must choose between General de Gaulle and the American alliance.” 5 As a result, the Ge rman participants – Fritz Berg, Max Brauer, Fritz Erler, Carlo Schmid and Otto Wolff – found themselves in an awkward position. Stressing the im - portance of Franco-German friendship, one of them said that creating “con - ditions which would force Germany to make a choice between friendship with France and friendship with the other Western countries” should be avoided. 6 One month after the Saltsjöbaden conference, the Monnet Committee decided to publish a declaration along the lines of Kohnstamm’s speech. 7 Having kept their many American friends fully informed about their think - ing, Monnet and Kohnstamm were happy to learn that President Kennedy, prodded along by Ball and others in the State Department, adopted their basic concept in his July 4, 1962 speech in Philadelphia. 8 As Kennedy put it in this speech: We do not regard a strong and united Europe as a rival but as a partner. To aid its progress has been the basic object of our foreign policy for"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"234 Alliance in crisis 1 7 years. We believe that a united Europe will be capable of playing a greater role in the common defense, of responding more generously to the needs of poorer nations, of joining with the United States and others in lowering trade barriers, resolving problems of commerce, commodi - ties, and currency, and developing coordinated policies in all economic, political, and diplomatic areas. We see in such a Europe a partner with whom we can deal on a basis of full equality in all the great and bur - densome tasks of building and defending a community of free nations. Both Kennedy and Monnet believed that a partnership on an equal foot - ing was only feasible if the UK joined the European project. In Kennedy’s words: “The first order of business is for our European friends to go forward in forming the more perfect union which will someday make this partner - ship possible.” 9 This was, of course, also the great weakness in what later became known as Kennedy’s Grand Design. By directly challenging de Gaulle’s concept of an independent Europe, the president hoped to create sufficient pressure in Europe – especially in Germany – to drive de Gaulle into accepting Great Britain in the EEC. Beyond such pressure, however, there was little either Kennedy or the Monnet Committee could do to force the General’s hand. The transatlantic crisis of 1963 On January 14 1963, President de Gaulle’s publicly announced decision to unilaterally end the British membership negotiations, coupled with his refusal to explore a NATO nuclear deal based on the US-British Nassau Agreement, plunged the West into a deep crisis, made worse by the national - ist tone in which it was done. 10 De Gaulle warned that an enlarged European community risked losing its cohesion as part of a “colossal Atlantic commu - nity under American dependence and direction.” He also questioned the trustworthiness of the American nuclear deterrent for Europe, pointing to the Cuban Missile Crisis as evidence that “the defence of Europe” had be - come a “secondary consideration” for the United States because of the fact that the Soviet Union now possessed the nuclear forces “to threaten even the life of America.” 11 De Gaulle also made much of the fact that the Nassau offer, which had been extended to Great Britain and France in the form of Polaris missiles, made no sense for France, since she lacked the necessary submarine and thermonuclear technology. Here, the French president seems to have pur - posely ignored that the offer from President Kennedy implied that France could receive help beyond what the British needed. 12 Given the improvised nature of the Nassau Summit and the internal divisions of the Kennedy administration, this message was somewhat muddled, but US Ambassador Charles Bohlen made clear to de Gaulle in early January that far-reaching US assistance was on the table if the French president accepted some sort"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Alliance in crisis 23 5 of NATO multilateralism. 13 On the other hand, the French president had been disappointed before by American offers of nuclear assistance, and the fact that Kennedy’s offer was made at an Anglo-American summit without consultation with France would surely have annoyed him. 14 McGeorge Bundy, Kennedy’s national security advisor, argued that de Gaulle’s press conference was very much part of a pattern. The Gaullists seemed to be using every opportunity in the battle for the hearts and minds of Europe to undermine trust in US leadership. “Our emphasis on conven - tional weapons,” Bundy told President Kennedy, has been distorted to imply a lack of firmness in our nuclear guaran - tees of Europe. Our insistence upon communications with Moscow has been distorted to mean that we may sacrifice the interests of others for the purpose of accommodation among the giants. Even our final and decisive confrontation in Cuba has been read as a demonstration that while we will not risk our nation for Europe, we will risk Europe to meet a local threat at home. All this was immensely frustrating to Kennedy and his advisors because they felt that after the Cuban Missile Crisis, a singular opportunity existed to move beyond the Berlin crisis. As Bundy put it: “we are in a better posi - tion for serious negotiation with the Soviet Union than at any time since the war.” At the same time, European concerns about nuclear strategy had to be taken seriously: The victory of Cuba has increased our stature--but it has also increased the fear that by our own local action we might quite literally bring an end to Europe. These questions are spoken only by our opponent de Gaulle, but they are felt among our friends, and we owe them an answer. 15 In the Federal Republic, Adenauer wasn’t pleased with de Gaulle’s press conference, but decided that he could not postpone the signing of the Fr anco-German Treaty ten days later. 16 The fact, however, that the treaty read very much like a bilateral Fouchet Plan and contained a provision on defense cooperation that seemed likely to undermine NATO caused con - cern not just in Washington but also in Bonn. Privately, President Kennedy and others worried that a secret nuclear deal between France and Germany might be in the working as well. 17 Moreover, by signing the treaty at this particular moment, Adenauer could not prevent the impression that he sup - ported de Gaulle’s decisions. In response, members of the informal alliance on both sides of the At lantic started a public and private campaign to add a preamble to the Treaty mak - ing clear Germany’s continued alliance loyalties. 18 Bilderbergers Erler and Birrenbach were closely involved in this campaign; Birrenbach in particu - lar worked intensively with Monnet and Kohnstamm to formulate such a"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"236 Alliance in crisis p reamble and to win political support for it. While Birrenbach was primar - ily responsible for organizing the CDU opposition to the Franco-German Treaty as it stood, Monnet and Kohnstamm kept in close touch with various members of the Kennedy Administration as well as the SPD, FDP and DGB leadership. 19 They even considered the possibility of a nationwide strike to underline opposition to Adenauer’s Gaullist policy. On the US side, members of the transatlantic elite like Acheson, Mc Cloy, the American Council on Germany’s Christopher Emmett, and Ge neral Lu cius Clay started a letter-writing campaign to convince their Ge rman contacts that Adenauer had gone too far. 20 In official contacts with Ger man diplomats, a similar line was taken by the Kennedy Administra - tion. In early February, the American Ambassador in Bonn told Kennedy that with “discreet action” the ratification of the Franco-German Treaty could be influenced. In addition, the Kennedy Administration started pro - moting the MLF, hoping to prevent a German push for a Franco-German nuclear deal. Meanwhile, George Ball used friendly reporters such as The New York Times ’ James Reston to send a strong signal of disapproval. “Adenauer is now being asked to act upon de Gaulle’s vision,” Reston wrote in a column passed on for local use by US embassies in Europe, to rely on French atomic power when France will not rely on Am erican, and to reject British membership in the community on the theory that Britain would be a kind of Trojan horse in Europe for the United States. This amounts to the preposterous suggestion that the United States Government would not only abandon its allies in Europe after a Soviet attack but would abandon its own armies standing closer to the Red Army than does France. 21 Most striking about the response of the informal alliance was its emotional nature – almost reminiscent of the way Bilderberg participants talked of the Soviet-Communist threat in the mid-1950s. McCloy told his old friend Adenauer: I am more disturbed by the turn of events than I have been at any time since the end of the war. I have the fear that unless steps are deliberately taken, the goals of European unity and Atlantic partnership toward which you have always directed your policies may be fatally disrupted. 22 Birrenbach, using similar language, told a friend that just before de Gaulle’s press conference he “began to realise that our cause was in mortal danger.” Monnet, in turn, warned the US diplomat Livingston Merchant “that de Gaulle on January 14 had invoked ancestral memories and loyalties which struck a responsive chord widely, not only in France but in Germany and Italy as well. Hence we must start moving promptly.”"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"Alliance in crisis 237 Bilderberg responds Against this emotionally charged background, the 1963 Bilderberg confer - ence in Cannes, France (March 29–31) took on extra importance. 23 Van der Beugel warned Prince Bernhard that it would not be easy: There is absolutely no doubt that this will be one of the most difficult conferences that Your Royal Highness will have presided over in the context of Bilderberg. The situation is explosive; the issues are explosive; the participants are explosive and in addition my conversations have made clear that nobody knows what needs to be done after the G e ner a l’s intervention. The only ones who have a clear line, are the French. Both the Americans and the British lack a strategy; the Ge rmans are drifting more than ever and the state of the Alliance is, in my view, more seri - ous and more confused than it has ever been since 1945. All this makes the Bilderberg conference extremely important, since it is the first time since de Gaulle dropped his bombshell that this type of group gets to - gether. However, if the meeting is not managed well, it carries grave risks, in part for the future work of Bilderberg. It is not difficult, after all, to offend all the French in the first half hour, but it is difficult to have these days end on a somewhat positive note. 24 As a result, the Bilderberg organizers decided that Prince Bernhard would give a special introduction, drafted by Van der Beugel, reiterating the cen - tral idea behind the Bilderberg meetings. “During the long years we have met,” the Prince announced at the start of the conference, we have never tried to solve problems. What we have always tried to do is to analyse and to discuss problems of mutual concern and in our dif - ferent jobs try to influence our friends outside Bilderberg with the aim of strengthening the Western Community and of fostering a better un - derstanding not only between Europe and our North American friends but also inside Europe itself. He went on to call for a civilized discussion: “Without wishing to put a brake on the frankness of our discussions I think we should try to analyse rather than to attack and finally try to define what should happen from now on.” 25 The run-up to the conference had been nerve-racking for Van der Beugel and Lamping. It had started with the French government insisting that the Bilderberg meeting in France should avoid “acutely controversial issues.” 26 Apparently, President de Gaulle had felt the Saltsjöbaden meeting to be overly critical of France (perhaps annoyed at being called a giraffe with a sore throat in the widely quoted Reston column). 27 The Bilderberg organ - izers, however, had refused to allow any outside interference in setting the agenda of the Cannes meeting. Wilfrid Baumgartner – who had issued the"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"238 Alliance in crisis F rench invitation – had to convince de Gaulle that the conference could only take place if the French government refrained from trying to influ - ence the discussions. 28 By November 1962, de Gaulle agreed to welcome the Bi lderberg Group without any conditions – perhaps because by that time he had greatly strengthened his domestic position after settling the Algerian war and after winning a surprisingly large majority in a referendum on his policies. Cooperation between the Bilderberg organizers and Baumgartner, how - ever, remained difficult. The choice of hotel wasn’t settled until two months before the conference, and only after it became clear that the non-Gaullist camp in France would be well-represented at Cannes (“You’re inviting all our enemies,” Foreign Minister Couve de Murville told Baumgartner) did the Gaullists confirm their participation. 29 To keep control, however, they designated “one 100 percent Gaullist as their speaker: [Jacques] Baumel, on whom the General was sure he could count.” 30 In addition to Baumel, the secretary-general of the Gaullist Party Union pour la Nouvelle République , the French participants in Cannes were Wilf rid Baumgartner, Maurice Faure, André Fontaine (foreign affairs correspond - ent of Le Monde ), René Massigli, Guy Mollet, Jacques Piette, Antoine Pinay, René Pleven, Jacques Segard, and former OEEC Secretary General René Sergent. On the American side, Ball, McGhee, and Nitze represented the Kennedy Administration, with the State Department’s Director of At lantic Policy Studies, Harold van B. Cleveland, also present. In addition, virtu - ally all American Steering Committee members came to Cannes, as well as Republican Senator Bourke B. Hickenlooper, Congressman Cornelius Ga llagher, Cornell University President James A. Perkins, and former NATO Ambassador Charles Spofford. Prime Minister Macmillan decided to send Lord Privy Seal Edward Heath, who had been responsible for the Common Market negotiations, to Cannes. 31 In addition, the Bilderberg regulars Bennet, Cavendish-Bentinck, Gubbins, and Healey were joined by Labour MP James Callaghan. 32 For Germany there were two new participants: Hans-Heinrich Herwarth von Bittenfeld, the secretary of state to the West German president, and Franz Josef Strauß, who in January had been forced to resign as defense minister because of the Spiegel controversy but who remained a force to be reck - oned with as leader of the Bavarian CSU. The other Germans present were Fritz Berg, Max Brauer, Fritz Erler, Carlo Schmid, and Otto Wolff von Amerongen. The fact that the smaller nations were similarly well-represented, com - plemented by a strong list of ‘international participants’ – Henrik Beer (secretary general of the League of Red Cross Societies); Guillaume Guindey (general manager of the Bank for International Settlements); Max Ko hnstamm; Emile van Lennep (chair of the OECD’s Monetary Working Group); EEC Commissioner Sicco Mansholt; SACEUR General Lyman Lemnitzer; and Pierre Uri of the Atlantic Institute – illustrated"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"Alliance in crisis 239 t he importance of the moment. As George Ball put it in his report to the Na tional Security Co uncil, the meeting had “brought together for the first time since de Gaulle’s press conference of January 14 the leaders of major European States.” 33 From the Gaullist side, Jacques Baumel put forward the Gaullist case in a way that was widely taken to be the official position of the French gov - ernment. Baumel asserted that it was necessary to “restore the balance of the very foundations of this Alliance on both sides of the Atlantic in a more suitable manner.” Europe had recovered in 15 years’ time, he said, whereas NATO was still “a predominantly American organization.” In this respect, the nuclear question was the most important one, Baumel argued, for everyone knows perfectly well that the world of tomorrow will be dominated by the atom and [...] only nations having the atom at their disposal will tomorrow be modern nations, strong nations with which it will be necessary to reckon. For the moment, he added, nuclear forces could only be national forces for there is no nuclear force that is not in the service of political power. And that political power, for the time being, is a national power, and, considering the tragic consequences of the use of this force, only States may take the crushing responsibility of being able to use it. Baumel suggested that if the United States decided to help the French nu - clear effort – alongside the other European power with “a world position,” meaning the UK – then “frankly everything will be possible,” including “very close cooperation and a genuine full coordination.” 34 This last remark w as clearly aimed at those in the Kennedy Administration who favored giv - ing France nuclear assistance. 35 Baumel went on to accuse the United States of trying to maintain its nuclear monopoly. “Everything proposed [by America] on the subject of nuclear forces,” he argued, “and now in a different form of multinational or even multilateral force, consists in giving their allies the impression of [p ossessing] a certain amount of responsibility, but in sovereignly [ sic ] re - taining the sole right to press a button!” The American emphasis on con - ventional forces, Baumel said, was meant to keep the Europeans in the role of “footsloggers.” The Nassau agreement and the cancellation of Skybolt, moreover, were proof that the United States did not always take the interests of its allies into account. Baumel’s speech, carefully designed to appeal to all those who either dis - trusted US aims in Europe or who thought that Europe should become more responsible for its own defense, made a deep impression on many partici - pants. Ball had the speech translated and sent it to Bundy, McNamara, and Rusk. A report of the Cannes meeting for the Ford Foundation described it"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"240 Alliance in crisis a s “the most forthright presentation of the Gaullist point of view ever put forth in any forum.” 36 During the subsequent discussion of the nuclear question, most support for Baumel’s position came from other French participants. With respect to the French national nuclear force, three counterproposals were advanced during the Cannes discussion: (1) the multilateral force; (2) an independent European nuclear force, perhaps based on the French and British forces; and (3) a much greater sharing of information and knowledge about the American strategic deterrent and targeting. George Ball used the MLF to defend the US position and argued that the present course of events would inevitably lead to further proliferation of nuclear weapons. The United States thought this was a dangerous prospect given the increased risk of accidents. Therefore, a different solution had to be found to the nuclear problem in NATO. Ball said that the MLF, with “joint possession of certain nuclear devices with power of decision being held on an equal footing,” was the best possible solution for the moment. This might not be the perfect solution, but Europe had “not yet reached a stage where it could speak with a single voice.” And not only would the non-nuclear NATO members have the possibility of a greater participation in their nuclear defense, they would also “share America’s experience in the management of such a force.” 37 In response, Baumel did all he could to undermine the American MLF proposal. “I am quite certain,” he said, “that our British friends, who have accepted the Nassau Agreements on the basis of a multinational force are much less enthusiastic now about the establishment of a multilateral force with mixed crews and under a single command.” He also ridiculed the Po laris offer made to France at the time of the Nassau Summit, saying “[w]e were being offered ball-point pens without the ball points and with - out ink [...].” Moreover, the multilateral force, Baumel maintained, “has no chance of becoming a fact.” He called the MLF mission to Europe of US diplomat Livingston Merchant a failure and argued that the only possibility for a multilateral force would be a German-American force. 38 Ball privately favored the concept of an MLF evolving into a truly Eu ropean force, without an American veto. If he could have said so dur - ing the Cannes conference, he would have deflected much of Baumel’s criti- cism, which clearly resonated with some European participants. The trouble was, however, that President Kennedy was not prepared to relinquish the American veto. 39 Moreover, even if he was, Congress had to agree to such a decision, and congressional reluctance to loosen US control over nuclear weapons was considerable. When Kohnstamm asked Ball privately why he had not reacted more forcefully to Baumel’s remarks about the American veto, Ball answered: “How can I answer with Senator Hickenlooper present at the meeting?” 40 The amount of support for the second proposal – a European nuclear force – showed that the Gaullist rhetoric about a more independent Europe"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"Alliance in crisis 241 a ppealed to many Europeans. Pierre Uri advanced a proposal for a merging of the French and British nuclear forces. Pleven, Mollet, and Fontaine all spoke out in favor of an independent European deterrent. Fontaine pointed out that with the increasing number of intercontinental ballistic missiles, the strategic importance of Europe for the United States had decreased. Co nsequently, the idea of a nuclear-protected “fortress America” had be - come a realistic possibility. With the Suez crisis in mind, Fontaine said that in case of a different assessment of vital interests between Europe and the United States, Europe would need its own deterrent as a “safety parachute.” 41 Strauß presented a similar argument. He stated that a real Atlantic part - nership could only be built on the basis of a united Europe with its own nuclear force, not one dependent on the United States. At the same time, he rejected Baumel’s argument that a nuclear force could only be national. In the nuclear age, Strauß said, national sovereignty was “obsolete.” This was somewhat disingenuous since as defense minister, Strauß had privately argued that West Germany would have to develop its own nuclear force if no satisfactory NATO nuclear force came into being. 42 Perhaps his real aim had been to gain a larger say in nuclear strategy and to close the gap be - tween France and the UK as nuclear powers and Germany as a non-nuclear power. 43 However, Strauß’s actions had caused him to have an international reputation as a nationalist with ideas similar to de Gaulle; at Cannes, Strauß obviously wished to improve his standing with an important audience in view of his own political future. As a result, Strauß stressed the German “determination to hold aloof from national nuclear weapons.” 44 The third proposal was advanced by Denis Healey. Healey rejected the multinational force proposed at Nassau because it was discriminatory. With respect to the MLF, he argued that it was very difficult to solve the puzzle of control, even if the United States was willing to give up its veto. For many European countries, it was easier to trust America than to trust each other. In Healey’s view, the best solution therefore was to give “the Eur opeans a greater say in the use of the deterrent by increasing their knowledge in this field and intensifying joint consultation,” something that was indeed done three years later with the creation of NATO’s Nuclear Planning Group (NPG). Fritz Erler supported Healey, arguing that it was a waste of re - sources for Europe to spend a great deal of money on nuclear weapons that would merely duplicate the American deterrent. Even if the discussions showed considerable support for a European nu - clear force, this did not necessarily mean support for de Gaulle. Several speakers pointed out that de Gaulle was no more willing to give up his nu - clear veto than the United States. Moreover, de Gaulle’s rejection of British membership in the EEC and his diplomatic style were widely condemned. The Italian politician Mario Pedini openly accused the French president of “anti- Am ericanism.” 45 But it was Spaak who used some of the most emotional language, calling the day of de Gaulle’s press conference “the free world’s black Monday.” De Gaulle had shown a complete disregard for the interests"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"242 Alliance in crisis o f his European allies and preferred the diplomacy of the “fait accompli.” By doing so, Spaak said, de Gaulle challenged “the principles which had governed Western policy for fifteen years.” Spaak expressed “vigorous oppo - sition” to de Gaulle’s insistence on a completely independent French nuclear force. 46 The implied distrust of the American deterrent, he said, was dan - gerous. Even if some of France’s complaints about Ame rican predominance in the nuclear field were justified, he continued, they should be discussed in the NATO framework. Moreover, mentioning the case of Czechoslovakia, Spaak pointedly remarked that France’s record of guaranteeing the security of other countries was not particularly impressive. 47 “[ T]he French,” Spaak concluded, “could not provide France’s allies in continental Europe with the guarantees offered by the United States deterrent.” 48 Edward Heath also launched a sharp attack on de Gaulle. He argued that a solution to the nuclear problem could only be partial as long as no Eu ropean or Atlantic political authority existed. However, Heath said, par - tial solutions were only possible with greater willingness to compromise. At the moment, France made no contribution to NATO, did not work towards greater European unity, and did not contribute to the UN or to disarma - ment negotiations. France’s partners were entitled to ask France “to play he r p a r t.” 49 With respect to the force de frappe , Heath added that “the ques - tion was not whether France would have a nuclear force or not but what that country would do with it. In the absence of increased consultation within NATO, certain anxieties might develop.” 50 On the issue of the Common Market, Heath did his best to show that Britain had been a reasonable nego - tiator and that the blame for the unilateral break-off resided solidly in Paris. When Prince Bernhard asked a number of French and German partici - pants to comment on the Franco-German Treaty, the Gaullist-Atlanticist divide was again apparent. Strauß emphasized the historic character of Franco-German reconciliation and attempted to diffuse concerns about its impact on NATO. Erler, however, made clear that the treaty should only be - come effective “within the framework of Atlantic and European solidarity. Any doubt in this regard should be removed when the time came to ratify the treaty by including precise legal references.” Mollet likewise warned that the treaty, so reminiscent of the Fouchet Plan, “introduced within Six-Power Europe a threat to smaller countries, more specifically in that it provided for certain decisions to be reached between Germany and France, thereby tam - pering with the operation of the Community.” 51 After the Cannes conference, Ernst van der Beugel told several friends that it had been a useful meeting – not only because of the quality of the participants and discussions, but especially because the goals of de Gaulle’s foreign policy and their incompatibility with the Atlantic alliance and Eu ropean integration had become so clear. In a letter to his friend Henry Kissinger, Van der Beugel wrote: The French were absolutely impossible; the Gaullists stated their case and the others, amongst whom Faure, former Prime Ministers and"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"Alliance in crisis 243 p eople like Fontaine and Baumgartner did not really dare to speak up. Since 1944 I never had the feeling that fascism was in a room where I was; now I had. If after the Bilderberg meeting anybody would have any illusion about their attitude they must be nuts. 52 On the other hand, Van der Beugel was not satisfied with the American re - sponse to the Gaullist challenge. He thought both Ball and Nitze had been rather weak in their statements. As he told his friend Eric Warburg: My strongest impressions are that the Americans are off balance and have no alternative policy after the breakdown of Brussels; that the Germans are more confused than ever and the British are in a very dif - ficult position because of the domestic scene. 53 Lamping added in a private memorandum that the Gaullists felt their isolation, and that they were impressed in particular by the American contributions that expressed a heart-felt disappointment about the fact that de Gaulle’s government obstructed the Atlantic security system that had been honestly and openly created by the US government. The anti-Gaullist forces in France, meanwhile, had been given an opportu - nity to “put forward their objections against the President’s policies in front of a high-quality international audience.” 54 Despite the success of the Cannes conference, the problem of French par - ticipation remained acute. Even anti-Gaullists like Mollet and Pleven had emphasized that “French prestige” should be taken into account. In addi - tion, Lamping noted that certain psychological issues played a role: The Frenchman, after all, doesn’t feel at ease in an Anglo-Saxon atmos - phere: these are two different worlds; the French find it difficult to call each other Jack or John instead of Monsieur le Ministre or Monsieur le Président ; the mutual teasing (Healey – Jackson for example) doesn’t come naturally to the Frenchman for whom discussions about politi- cal issues are sacredly earnest; the ‘old-boys-milieu’ he regards as diffi - cult to understand with its misogynistic connotations; he is not used to cocktails before dinner; a lack in fluency in the English language causes the Frenchman never to feel fully included. 55 After returning to Washington, George Ball reported to the National Security Council that the Bilderberg discussions had shown that: De Gaulle is isolating himself more and more, and that he does not have a “grand design,” or even a clear European policy. All de Gaulle can re - ally do is to oppose the initiative of others by being negative. He cannot"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"244 Alliance in crisis b uild the Europe he desires because his actions are conditioned by his overriding desire to build the predominance of France. As a result, he has nothing to offer other European states. [...] Ambassador Bohlen agreed with the analysis that de Gaulle cannot organize a European nuclear force. De Gaulle still yearns for a U.S./U.K./France directorate in which France would speak for all of Europe. However, Europeans are not prepared to have de Gaulle speak for them. Except for de Gaulle, most Europeans do not want the U.S. to get out of Europe. 56 With regard to the general political situation in Europe, Ball saw little room for new initiatives. As long as de Gaulle was in power, British membership in the EEC was out of the question. Moreover, Ball said that “as a result of numerous informal conversations [...] he was impressed with the lame duck character of most of the member governments of NATO.” The Macmillan Government was surrounded by an “air of death,” and Adenauer was on his way out. Adenauer’s departure would greatly reduce de Gaulle’s power in Europe. 57 The long-term danger, Ball emphasized, was that as a result of de Gaulle’s policies and the general uncertainty of the political situation in Europe, a resurgence of nationalism could occur, particularly in Germany. However, the overall conclusion of the Cannes meeting was clear: although many Eu ropeans shared de Gaulle’s aim of a more independent Europe, they re - jected his methods – at least for now. Ball’s assessment of the political situation in Germany soon found confirmation in the German debate concerning the ratification of the Fr anco-German Treaty. The Atlanticist group in the CDU – which, besides Birrenbach, also included Adenauer’s likely successor Ludwig Erhard – de cided to put its weight behind the idea of adding a special clause to the preamble of the treaty emphasizing the continuing German support for a close European-American partnership, for an integrated NATO defense, and for the existing European Communities. Birrenbach, Kohnstamm and Monnet were closely involved in the drafting of the preamble. 58 In early April, Adenauer finally buckled under the combined pressure of the FDP, the SPD and the Atlanticists within his own party and agreed to the preamble. During the ratification of the Franco-German Treaty in the Bundestag in May 1963, the preamble received overwhelming support. The wording of the preamble – calling for a partnership between the United States and Europe – strikingly resembled President Kennedy’s In dependence Day speech, as well as the 1962 resolution of the Monnet Committee. 59 The Gaullist-Atlanticist crisis provided the SPD with an excellent oppor - tunity to prove that it had become a reliable supporter of the Atlantic alli - ance. Although the pro-Western stance of the party had been announced in 1960, doubts remained widespread about the real preferences of men such as Herbert Wehner. The SPD stance on the Franco-German Treaty now re - moved some of these doubts. In other words, the SPD had become a viable"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"Alliance in crisis 245 a nd – from the American point of view – safe alternative to Adenauer and the CDU. The SPD Bilderberg members used their Bilderberg connections to emphasize this point in Washington. During the 1963 Bilderberg con - ference in Cannes, Fritz Erler and Max Brauer asked George McGhee to arrange separate visits for them with President Kennedy. 60 The fact that the president agreed to see them both indicated the importance of the change in the political situation in West Germany. As Brauer told the SPD leadership: “[Kennedy] hopes that a SPD victory will improve the situation. He is done with Adenauer.” 61 Kennedy’s visit to the Federal Republic (where he gave his famous “Ich bin ein Berliner” speech) in June 1963 did much to reinforce Germany’s Atlantic orientation. 62 In contrast with de Gaulle’s nationalist message, Ke nnedy publicly reinforced calls for an Atlantic partnership in front of record crowds and secured the support of Adenauer’s soon-to-be successor Erhard. At the same time, the President found his reluctance to fully com - mit to the MLF confirmed by a number of German politicians who privately expressed doubts about its feasibility. Kennedy also did not hesitate to ig - nore German sensitivities later in the year as he negotiated a Limited Test Ban Treaty with the Soviet Union. The 1964 Williamsburg conference In the following years, the informal alliance continued to play an impor - tant role in the Gaullist-Atlanticist struggle. When Van der Beugel travelled to the United States in preparation for the 1964 Bilderberg conference in Williamsburg, Virginia (March 20–22) he was struck by “how strong the interest in the Bilderberg Conference is at the highest levels of the White House, the State Department and the Pentagon.” 63 As he reported to Prince Bernhard, Secretary of State Rusk had even proposed hosting a reception for all Bilderberg participants, something Van der Beugel had rejected be - cause it might lead to unnecessary publicity and set an unwanted precedent (“I’d be unwilling to bring my tailcoat to Bilderberg”). In the end, both Rusk and new President Lyndon Johnson used the Bilderberg meeting to set up a number of individual meetings with participants. The conference itself featured a reprise of the Cannes debate on NA TO’s future, with two prominent Gaullists, Baumel and Christian de la Malène, present. As the hosting nation, the American group was larger than usual and included Dean Acheson, George Ball, McGeorge Bundy, Ar thur Dean, Se nator William Fulbright (D), Representative Chet Hol ifield (the De mocratic chairman of the JAEC), C. D. Jackson, Senator Henry Ja ckson (D), Senator Jacob Javits (R), Henry Kissinger, John McCloy, George McGhee, and Shepard Stone. From Europe, a number of first-time Bi lderbergers participated, including Gaston Deferre, the Socialist opponent of de Gaulle in the French presidential elections; Minister of State for For - eign Affairs Lord Dundee; Danish Foreign Minister Per Haekkerup; Dutch"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"246 Alliance in crisis F oreign Minister Joseph Luns; British diplomat (and future Bi lderberg chair - man) Eric Roll; General Hans Speidel (former commander of the NATO land forces in Central Europe); NATO Secretary General Dirk Sti kker; and Ludger Westrick, one of Chancellor Erhard’s most trusted aides. The Williamsburg meeting began with one of the traditional Bilderberg discussions about recent changes in the Soviet Union and their wider sig - nificance for East-West relations. Marshall Shulman, a Soviet expert at Co lumbia University, held the introductory statement and argued that while the basic Soviet aims had not changed, the changes in short-term tactics were substantial and had become more deeply rooted than originally envi - sioned. The increasing Sino-Soviet tensions – which had escalated due to Soviet reluctance to help the Chinese to develop nuclear weapons – coupled with Soviet internal problems meant that the West could expect a prolonged period of peaceful coexistence. Moreover, the euphoria of the post-Sputnik years had evaporated, and Marxist-Leninist theory had difficulty explain - ing the period of economic growth and prosperity in the West. Still, the Cold War would not end any time soon. Shulman concluded that the prospects for a real political settlement with the Soviet Union were not good. “It is sometimes thought,” he said, “that Western countries should respond to this process of change [in the Soviet Union] by holding out op - portunities for collaboration with the Soviet Union.” This would be a mis - take, Shulman argued. The past years had shown that the Soviet Union only reacted to Western strength and unity. “[W]hat is required [...],” Shulman concluded, is a policy which should not be defined on a simple linear scale from hard to soft, but a differentiated policy – one which [...] is firmly re - sistant to Soviet expansion and militant action, but at the same time seeks measures of collaboration [...] where there are mutual overlapping interests, particularly in seeking to introduce some safeguards into the military situation. 64 As could be expected, left-leaning participants such as Healey, Deferre, and Paolo Vittorelli – the editor of Avanti! and the foreign affairs spokesman of the Nenni Socialists – emphasized the changes in the Soviet Union, whereas Ball, Senator Javits, and Assistant Secretary of the Auswärtiges Amt Franz Krapf highlighted “the stability of Soviet aims.” 65 Ernst Majonica noted that many participants tended to “very optimistic forecasts” and felt it nec - essary to warn that the Soviet attitude on the German question remained the best way to predict Soviet intentions. 66 The Gaullist deputy Christian de la Malène, in turn, defended the French decision to officially recognize Communist China. According to Roll, His speech may well have been addressed to the Germans, as if to say ‘here are the Anglo-Saxons worrying about Asia, Africa etc. and"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"Alliance in crisis 247 wh ether the Chinese are worse than the Russians. We think all Commu - nists are bad, and Central Europe is the real issue. 67 On East-West Trade, George Ball gave a detailed statement regarding the official US position. He distinguished between different communist areas. On trade with the Soviet Union, the US maintained its opposition to selling strategic goods. The recent US sales of wheat to the Soviet Union, therefore, did not reflect a change of policy. With regard to Eastern Europe, Ball said, the Johnson Administration favored a more flexible attitude, because of the wider aim “to make them less dependent on the Soviet Union.” With regard to Communist China, North Korea and North Vietnam, on the other hand, the US rejected any trade whatsoever. According to Ball, “the aggressive and criminal behavior of China which threatened the West’s vital interests” – particularly in Vietnam – made a complete trade boycott imperative. 68 Most participants agreed that an increase in East-West trade – part icularly with Eastern Europe – was to the advantage of the West. Otto Wolff ex - pressed his delight that this taboo could at long last be realistically dis - cussed in the United States. He warned, however, for too much optimism. The ability of the communist countries to trade with the West was severely limited because of the inferior quality of most of their goods. The only way to offset this imbalance was to extend long-term credits (12 to 15 years), but this was unacceptable since it amounted to “economic development aid.” 69 As Roll reported, most participants agreed that long-term credit “was the one thing at which they drew the line.” 70 Again, the British participants were an exception, but they were completely isolated. Dean Acheson did not attempt to hide his contempt for the British attitude on East-West trade and reminded the conference that 25 years ago, the United States had agreed to the British suggestion to impose economic sanctions against Adolf Hitler’s G er m a ny. In the discussion on NATO, Acheson presented his introductory report. He compared NATO to a Mississippi steamboat – “going upstream it can’t go forward and blow the whistle at the same time” – and emphasized the importance of Western unity in the face of the continued division of the world. Central Europe, Acheson argued, still remained the crucial prob - lem, if only because West Germany regarded it as such. Only if NATO pos- sessed much stronger conventional forces, Acheson argued, would the West be able to decisively influence events in that area. The Soviet Union would be forced to act with considerable caution in the event of greater autonomy of the satellites if they were faced with strong Western conventional forces on the other side of the Iron Curtain. In other words, Moscow would thus be forced to “ease up” its policy towards Eastern Europe. Also, in the event of a “blow-up” in East-Germany or elsewhere, conventional forces would be better able to prevent an escalation than forces wholly dependent on the early use of tactical nuclear weapons. Acheson ended by endorsing the MLF. He had become convinced that “it can be done”; that it was “hard to"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"248 Alliance in crisis o verestimate the importance of moving toward closer partnership”; and that the MLF served a major political purpose in giving Germany a greater role in nuclear planning and control without the risk of national proliferation. 71 Acheson’s endorsement of the MLF, despite his earlier skepticism, was undoubtedly based on the fact that NATO had developed no other strategies for dealing with the nuclear question. Several other initial MLF-skeptics – including Van der Beugel and Erler – now agreed that the MLF, despite its obvious defects, was the best answer to Gaullist complaints about American domination and the best way to prevent national proliferation of nuclear forces. 72 This was exactly the line followed by the State De partment’s MLF Office, which had arranged special MLF briefings for most US participants. 73 In a repeat of the Cannes scenario, Baumel attacked US nuclear and NATO policy in an hour-long speech. 74 But as Ernst Majonica noted in his diary, Baumel and his French colleagues were completely isolated. 75 Max Kohnstamm told the deputy assistant secretary of state for European affairs, J. Robert Schaetzel, that this time, in contrast to Cannes, more “E uropeans were speaking up against the Gaullists and did not leave the task to Am ericans.” 76 Eric Roll reported that apart from a short intervention by La Malene [sic], his Gaullist col - league, Baumel got no support from anyone in the subsequent discus - sion which was only divided between those who were wholeheartedly in favour of the M.L.F. as a means of strengthening the Alliance and those who were rather dubious about it. 77 Those opposing Baumel on the European side included Bennett, Bi rrenbach, Deferre, Erler, Luns, and Snoy et d’Oppuers. Deferre made clear that he, along with many Frenchmen, disagreed most of all with de Gaulle’s meth - ods. If he came to power, Deferre would be willing “to negotiate and reach common decisions.” 78 This was a welcome message, but Majonica was un - impressed by Deferre’s speech, writing in his diary: “de Gaulle will beat him in his sleep.” 79 Foreign Minister Luns replied to an accusation made by Baumel that Europe’s lack of progress in political integration was due to the Dutch and Belgian rejection of the Fouchet Plan in 1962. Luns ar - gued that the French refusal either to let Great Britain join the European Co mmunities or to accept a greater degree of integration had been the cause of failure in 1962. Skepticism about the MLF, however, was not limited to the Gaullists. Lord Dundee and Healey expressed their doubts about the expensive multi - lateral force, as did Henry Kissinger, who privately told Van der Beugel that he “had always opposed the MLF because I had thought it put too much strain on the German political fabric for a dubious objective.” 80 Vittorelli, moreover, explained that the MLF had become an issue in Italian politics because it allowed the communists to portray the government as opposed to détente. Luns asked whether some other device for a greater European say"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"Alliance in crisis 249 a nd education in the nuclear field could not be found. The military value of the MLF was limited and it was expensive. The Netherlands, he said, would not be able to contribute much to the force. Fritz Erler also called the MLF a second-best solution. Erler’s state - ment, which Kohnstamm called “by far the best performance of the entire meeting,” was a strong plea for the indivisibility of Western defense. The de fense of Europe could only be Atlantic, not national or regional. However, Eu rope’s economic resurgence and the end of the American nuclear monop - oly necessitated a greater European contribution to the common deterrent. This contribution, Erler argued, should preferably be in the field of joint strategic planning. The MLF would divert resources away from the needed conventional buildup. However, if the MLF was the only alternative to na- tional nuclear forces, Erler supported it. West Germany did not want to possess its own nuclear weapons, Erler concluded, but younger generations would not accept “permanent inferiority.” 81 On the American side, the response to the Gaullists was stronger than at Cannes. As Kohnstamm reported, Arthur Dean was so provoked by the French that he took them on openly. He said that a continuance of the kind of performance he had seen at Bilderberg could destroy the US-French friendship that had been built up over the past generations. 82 Bundy also gave a sharp retort to Baumel and in particular denied the latter’s accusation that de Gaulle’s September 1958 memorandum on NATO reform had never received a real reply. Senator Fulbright and Dean Acheson, more - over, solemnly reaffirmed the American commitment to NATO. After the Williamsburg conference, Van der Beugel told Henry Owen that [t]he American delegation showed great strength and cohesion and the five non-French members of the Common Market did very well, espe - cially the Germans. It was also very important, that the congressional participants were convinced beyond any doubt about the positive atti - tude of the overwhelming majority of the Europeans towards the United States and NATO. 83 The Gaullists, in other words, had failed to muster any support for their anti-NATO stance. The most vivid expression of European opposition to de Gaulle came from Carlo Schmid, who told Kohnstamm that “the Gaullist group was just like the Gauleiters of the Hitler period.” 84 The final day of the Williamsburg conference was spent discussing the one area of transatlantic relations where progress seemed possible: interna - tional trade. The general conclusion of the discussion was straightforward – the West should do all it could to lessen barriers to international trade in the Kennedy Round in GATT. The European Economic Community in"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"250 Alliance in crisis p articular had an obligation to avoid becoming a protectionist block – al though Sicco Mansholt made clear that agricultural protection would be a most difficult problem to solve. The presence of Mansholt, Ball, US trade coordinator Christian Herter, GATT Secretary Eric Wyndham White, Se nators Fulbright and Javits – both deeply involved in trade matters – the high OECD official Emile van Lennep, Snoy et d’Oppuers, Luns, and many others involved in international trade and finance, made the Bilderberg meetings into an important informal meeting place to ensure the success of the Kennedy Round. The transatlantic relationship – three schools of thought The second half of the 1960s was a frustrating period for all those who fa - vored both further European integration and a deepening of transatlantic ties. During the 1965 empty chair crisis, President de Gaulle prevented the EEC from moving to a system of majority voting on most issues. Then, on March 7, 1966, de Gaulle announced France’s withdrawal from NATO’s in - tegrated military structures. At the other side of the ocean, meanwhile, the choice of right-wing Senator Barry Goldwater to be the Republican nomi - nee in the 1964 presidential elections rattled many European Bilderbergers, representing, as it seemed, a return to dangerous nationalist traditions in US foreign policy. Even after President Johnson’s convincing victory, more - over, American leadership in Europe was in short supply – no doubt partly because of the Johnson Administration’s increasing preoccupation with the war in Vietnam. As Van der Beugel told the Atlantic Council’s Theodore Achilles in March 1965: “I belong to those Europeans who have no complex whatsoever as to strong American leadership and I deplore the lack of it especially during the last year.” During the Bilderberg conference that took place from April 2–4, 1965, at the Italian Villa d’Este, Lake Como, the conclusion seemed unavoidable that little could be done as long as de Gaulle remained in power. 85 Ernst van der Beugel contributed a paper on the State of the Alliance, asking whether the assumptions underlying the combined Cold War policy of European in - tegration and collective security through NATO were still valid. He identi - fied three (partly overlapping) schools of thought in the Gaullist-Atlanticist struggle. The first was the Gaullist school, inspired by a strong desire to increase the power and influence of Eur ope to such an extent that Europe could eventually have an independent policy in a world which till now was mainly dominated by the U.S. and the Soviet Union. It challenged the raison d’être of NATO and “does not believe in the per - manency of the U.S. political and military commitment to Europe.” As a result, it insisted upon “its wish to provide Europe with its own nuclear"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"Alliance in crisis 251 force.” It was not clear though, Van der Beugel noted, how “its European vision can be reconciled with the concept of the supremacy of the nation st at e.” 86 The second – and largest – school of thought “believes not only in the compatibility of European unity and Atlantic cohesion but it considers Eu ropean unification as a prerequisite to Atlantic strength.” It supported supranational European integration as the best way of tying Germany to the West and believed in the ultimate development of an Atlantic partner - ship. “Members of this school,” Van der Beugel said, “were generally activ - ists who considered any slowing down of European unification as being by definition detrimental to the cause of the West.” 87 The third, much smaller school of thought, to which Van der Beugel counted himself, had reached the conclusion that European integration and the Atlantic alliance were no longer mutually reinforcing. This school be - lieved that “foreign policy on main issues and military policy in general are Atlantic functions and not European functions.” 88 It was time to reject the idea of an equal partnership between Europe and the United States. Pr ogress in the field of political integration, after all, was impossible be - cause of the fundamental differences between de Gaulle and the other Five. The main task for the period ahead was to confine the efforts in Europe now to the economic field, to continue the struggle for the inclusion of the United Kingdom and other European countries in the continental group and to deepen and develop the mili - tary, economic and political integration, cooperation and consultation in the Atlantic Alliance. 89 The New York Times columnist James Reston gave Van der Beugel’s report a prominent (though anonymous) place in a long article in The New York Times and noted that “these sharp differences are found in all the Wes ter n European countries, and they indicate the magnitude of the task before the leaders of the alliance.” 90 This much also became clear during the Bi lderberg discussion on Van der Beugel’s paper, which, not surprisingly, drew a lot of criticism. Ball, a prominent proponent of the second school of thought, was the first to respond, in a passionate speech (quoted at the start of this book) si - multaneously defending the concept of Atlantic partnership and attacking Gaullist nationalism. “The twelve years between 1950 and 1962 were the Golden Age of progress towards European unity and the Atlantic partner - ship,” Ball said, “but at the beginning of 1963, one of the leading European nations had started to reverse the trend by a statement which had since been regarded as the first salvo in a nationalistic counter-revolution.” Ball argued that this counter-revolution aimed at “a return to a ‘fragmented’ Western Europe” and the “national rivalry between European states which had caused so many tragedies in the past.” Ball emphasized the"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"252 Alliance in crisis “ deep anxiety which this trend aroused in him,” and ended on an apoca- lyptic note: Few of us consciously desired to return to the bad old days when the fate of mankind depended on rivalry, jealousy and the whims of Nat ion States which were not channeled through joint plans, co-operation agreements and solemnly contracted obligations. [...] we all knew that such a system was ineffective and would never function again. [Ev eryone should] recall that history could repeat itself and that, if it repeated it - self in the nuclear age, we would all vanish in a mushroom cloud. 91 McGhee later reported that Ball’s speech had made a big impression; the subsequent discussion, however, confirmed Van der Beugel’s basic analy - sis. Both within the United States and within most European countries, members of the transatlantic elite were deeply divided between the three schools of thought. And despite Ball’s eloquence, it was also becoming increasingly clear that the period when the United States, for political rea - sons, had swallowed its economic objections to the Common Market was nearing its end, no doubt in part because of President de Gaulle’s policies. President Jo hnson’s sudden turn away from the MLF in late 1964 seemed to indicate a certain impatience with Europe in Washington, a desire to move on from Europe to more urgent problems in the rest of the world. 92 Tellingly, at the Villa d’Este conference Ball was asked to give a special presentation on the situation in Vietnam, as James Reston reported in The New York Times . Spring was in the air at the Villa d’Este, which, situated at the southern end of Lake Como, was probably the most beautiful spot where any of the Bilderberg conferences had taken place. Yet those present at the conference may have felt a twinge of melancholy. The Villa d’Este discussions set off by Van der Beugel seemed to signify the end of a distinct era; 20 years after the end of the Second World War, the era of the closest US involvement in Europe appeared to be over. Reston was attuned to this sentiment. “Yes,” he wrote, Europe is worried about us. Having muddled through themselves, they are now concerned about our muddling through. They fear we are turn - ing away from Europe, that we are looking homeward and even east - ward to Asia, that we are blindly anti-Communist just as, in their eyes, we were blindly anti-colonial in our rush to break up the old empires. Europe had liked Kennedy, Reston said, because “he was not a typical or representative American.” President Johnson was different, “because he looks and acts like the popular European caricature of an American politi - cian. Accordingly, since the election of Johnson and the bombing of North Vietnam many of the old popular anti-American feelings have revived.” 93"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Alliance in crisis 253 I n March 1966, de Gaulle provided further confirmation for this inter - pretation. Not only did he withdraw all French forces from NATO’s inte - grated military command structure, he also announced his intention to seek a Franco-Russian rapprochement, planning to visit Moscow in June 1966. 94 De Gaulle’s actions implied that, in his view, a unified Western alliance in the Cold War was no longer necessary and perhaps even inhibited a relaxa - tion of East-West tensions. Although the German participants at the Bilderberg conference held in Wiesbaden, West Germany (March 25–27, 1966) were especially shocked and worried by de Gaulle’s action, the overall result of the Bilderberg meet - ing was a feeling of almost relief that the alliance could get moving again on the logjam of blocked issues. 95 Of course, few doubted the dangers of de Gaulle’s approach, but the Wiesbaden conference provided an opportu - nity of readjusting the alliance to these new circumstances. Prince Bernhard specifically asked the members of the steering committee not to concentrate their remarks solely on the happenings of recent weeks (French Government’s decisions). It was hoped that an important place would be allotted to changes aimed at a long-term improvement in the working of NATO with the door left open for France to return eve nt u a l ly. 96 On the other hand, Van der Beugel told the Prince that frank talk and a strong European contribution was crucial: “I do not believe that you need to mask the seriousness of the situation in any way – to the contrary, with NATO the aim of Bilderberg is at stake.” 97 The Johnson Administration realized the importance of a strong pres - ence at Wiesbaden and was represented by George Ball, Robert Bowie (who had been appointed advisor on NATO matters), George McGhee, John Mc Cloy (the Administration’s point man for all German matters), and John W. Tu thill, the US representative to the European Communities. The West German government also saw the Wiesbaden conference as the first oppor - tunity to forge a Western response to the Gaullist challenge. Apart from Abs, Berg, Birrenbach, Erler, Schmid, and other Bilderberg regulars, Ch ancellor Er hard decided to participate in part of the meeting. Another first-time par - ticipant was SPD parliamentarian and defense specialist Hel mut Schmidt, “who,” Van der Beugel told Prince Bernhard, “in my opinion is the future leader of the SPD.” 98 Erhard used the Wiesbaden conference for private conversations with John McCloy and George Ball. Manlio Brosio, Stikker’s successor as NATO secretary general, was also present. The main conclusion of the Wiesbaden conference was that the NATO crisis should be used to create a new sense of direction in the alliance. John McCloy stated that de Gaulle’s actions had the advantage of forcing NATO to “face up to problems” that had existed for several years but could not be addressed because of French opposition. The great danger, however, was"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"254 Alliance in crisis t hat de Gaulle’s methods might win adherents in other European countries. Since “nationalism creates nationalism,” there was a real risk of Europe going adrift, whereas the United States might become so disheartened by the “complexities of Europe” that it might disengage to some extent from European affairs. To avoid these dangers, “the highest form of statesman - ship” was called for. 99 Fritz Erler agreed that de Gaulle was “riding a tiger” – it was highly ques - tionable whether the general could control the nationalistic forces he had set loose. George Ball used the occasion to reaffirm the US commitment to NATO and the alliance, much as he had done in the Villa d’Este. De Gaulle “seemed to be proposing to return to 1914.” However, Ball said, the United States remained convinced that a nationalistic, fragmented West could never achieve the common objectives of defense, deterrence, and finding a settlement in Europe – only the combined and organized power of the West could do so. 100 On the German side, both Erhard and Birrenbach indicated that they felt a solution of the nuclear question in NATO was now not only neces - sary but also possible because of the self-imposed French absence in NATO. Bi rrenbach showed greater willingness to compromise and abandoned his earlier insistence on a ‘hardware solution’ – involving co-ownership of nu - clear submarines. In effect, he moved much closer to Erler’s position, who fa - vored a joint planning and development solution – the ‘software solution.’ 101 The NATO crisis also led to greater flexibility on the part of the most impor - tant congressional representative in the nuclear question, JAEC Chairman Chet Holifield. Holifield indicated his willingness to consider amendments to the McMahon Act if the European allies could make a clear proposal of what they wanted. He argued that the McNamara Committee on nuclear strategy offered the most promising road forward. 102 A solution to the nu - clear problem finally seemed in sight, although it would take another serious crisis in confidence between the US and Germany over non- pro liferation and the matter of offset agreements and US troops in Germany before an agreement could be reached in 1967. 103 Secretary of State Dean Rusk’s rec - ommendation to President Johnson to turn the McNamara Co mmittee into the Nuclear Planning Group, meanwhile, was based to a considerable extent on information gathered at the Wiesbaden conference. Rusk referred not just to Ball’s talk with Erhard, but also to Holifield’s changed position and to Erler’s ideas about a solution to the nuclear problem. 104 Birrenbach’s change of heart at Wiesbaden probably did not reflect con - viction as much as realism. During a trip to the United States in November 1965, he had received warnings from several high officials sympathetic to the German case that the political pressure for a US-Soviet non- pro liferation treaty was mounting – partly as the result of the Gilpatric Report on non- pro liferation. 105 It is indicative of the sensitivity of the Bilderberg organizers to such mood swings that they invited Roswell Gilpatric to the Wiesbaden conference, as well as Senator Fred Harris – one of 18 senators who had"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"Alliance in crisis 255 s igned a statement in favor of non-proliferation negotiations – and Zbigniew Brzezinski, a Columbia professor and part-time White House consultant who favored a more active détente policy towards the Soviet Union. Brzezinski argued at Wiesbaden that NATO should take a more active role in East-West relations and the relaxation of tensions with the Soviet Union. Most Bilderberg participants at Wiesbaden agreed that the threat of Soviet aggression in Europe was considerably smaller than only a few years ago (shortly after the Williamsburg conference Khrushchev had been forced to step back). The fact that this changed threat assessment came to be accepted in groups such as Bilderberg, paved the way for the 1967 NATO Harmel Exercise. The resulting Harmel Report introduced a new two-pillar concept of security for NATO, emphasizing the dual need for defense and détente. 106 De Gaulle’s challenge was by no means the only problem facing the alli - ance. The Vietnam War had increasingly become a strain on US-European relations, if only for the fear in Europe that America would become increas - ingly preoccupied with the war, with necessarily detrimental effects on the defense of Europe and the alliance as a whole. The high-level American presence at Wiesbaden was also an attempt to allay such European doubts. George Ball gave another special statement on the situation in Vietnam, meant both to inform the European allies and to win them over for a more active role outside the NATO area. 107 Ball was optimistic about the overall situation in Vietnam, arguing that the situation was improving because of the stepped-up US bombing campaign in North Vietnam and the increasing numbers of American forces. He expressed hope that the Viet-Cong would “find the rate of attrition intolerable” and that the US-supported actions to improve conditions in “pacified areas” would increase local support for the South Vietnamese government. 108 There was some irony in Ball’s presentation, however, because behind closed doors Ball was one of the strongest opponents of the Vietnam War in the Johnson Administration. 109 Another irony was that at the 1964 Wi lliamsburg conference, the French participants had explicitly warned the United States about repeating the dangerous mistakes France had made dur - ing the Indochina war. These warnings, although based on years of French experience in the region, did not register in Washington, in part because Gaullist criticism could so easily be rejected as simply anti- Am erican. 110 At Wi esbaden, meanwhile, Ball’s pep-talk did not seem to convince the Eu ropeans, who asked a series of probing questions about the possibility of escalation of the Vietnam War and about the willingness of the South Vietnamese to continue fighting. 111 A new generation The European response at Wiesbaden also reflected the mounting public opposition to the Vietnam War in much of Europe. In fact, the Bilderberg"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"256 Alliance in crisis o rganizers had become seriously concerned about the effects of Vietnam and the upsurge of youth and student movements on public support for NATO. 112 Shortly after the Wiesbaden conference, Ernst van der Beugel wrote a memorandum for the Bilderberg Steering Committee in which he warned that the basic assumptions of “practically every participant in the Bilderberg conferences” – in Van der Beugel’s words, the “need for Eur opean integration, need for a maximum of cohesion in the Atlantic world, need for a strong defensive posture towards the Eastern Bloc etc.” – were no longer shared by large parts of the Western publics, “especially the young peo - ple.” “I consider,” Van der Beugel wrote, “the Gaullist deviation as much less dangerous than the complete ignorance of and indifference to our basic assumptions in the minds and hearts of such a substantial part of the popu - lation in our part of the world.” The Bilderberg Steering Committee should discuss this development, to avoid becoming an “emeritus establishment group,” stuck in the 1950s. 113 Earlier attempts to prevent Bilderberg from ossifying had already led to the complete overhaul of the steering committee in 1964, but now a new sense of urgency was apparent – as it was in other organizations of the informal alliance such as the Atlantik-Brücke , the Atlantic Institute, the American Council on Germany, the CEDI, and the Ford Foundation. 114 As a result of Van der Beugel’s memorandum, the steering committee decided to invite more participants under the age of 40 for the 1967 and 1968 Bilderberg con - ferences. The Ford Foundation assisted with a long list of potential younger participants in the United States and Europe. The 1967 Bilderberg Conference in Cambridge (March 31–April 2) suc - ceeded in bringing in a significant number of new faces. 115 However, with the escalating student unrest in 1968, Bilderberg’s renewal remained a matter of great concern to the Bilderberg organizers. In September 1968, Van der Be ugel again wrote a memorandum to the members of the Bilderberg steer - ing committee, warning that from the point of view of age and from the point of view of opinion on basic matters of policy, we tend to be a rather one-sided group. In other words, to put it in the modern jargon we are very much ‘establishment’. 116 He added that by definition, the Bilderberg Group would always “have a strong establishment element,” but he argued that the process of bringing in younger people should be continued and intensified: The Chairman and the two Secretaries rejected the notion that we should organize the Bilderberg Meeting as a sort of confrontation be - tween two different groups but we found ourselves greatly in favour of an effort to increase the participation of much younger people who are much nearer to the views of the student generation in vital matters of foreig n p ol ic y."},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"Alliance in crisis 25 7 As an example, Van der Beugel mentioned the “[Eugene] McCarthy and younger [Robert] Kennedy people in the United States and the analogue groups in Europe.” 117 In an attempt to better grasp the generational changes that were rattling Western societies, the Bilderberg organizers also invited sociologists Daniel Bell and Ralf Dahrendorf and media guru Marshall McLuhan. Although Dahrendorf became a frequent participant, the effort seems to have had limited success. As Arthur Dean reported on a steering committee meeting in October 1969: There seemed to be general agreement among all of the members that we should not schedule another meeting of Bilderberg on “instability”. Baron Edmond de Rothschild said that he recently attended a meeting at Geneva on a similar subject where in his opinion they had wasted about two days’ time and he found the further discussion very boring. There also seemed to be a general consensus that we should not again invite sociologists to a Bilderberg meeting, but there was a general feel - ing that we should continue to invite younger persons in the fields that we decided upon to discuss. 118 In a sense, the members of the informal alliance had become victims of the success of most Western societies. The perceived decline of the Soviet threat and the increasing wealth in the United States and Western Europe had re - moved some of the driving forces and motives that had led the World War II generation to develop the Marshall plan, NATO, and an integrated Europe. The transatlantic crisis of the mid-1960s, meanwhile, did illustrate how the informal alliance could play a role in crisis management. Particularly, the debate in Germany between Gaullists and Atlanticists had been strongly influenced by members of the transatlantic elite. The Bilderberg meetings, moreover, managed to include Gaullist views, while making clear that the majority of Bilderberg participants remained committed to the basic aims of European integration and transatlantic cooperation. The combination of President de Gaulle’s unilateral methods, the strongly nationalist, anti- in tegration message of Gaullism, and de Gaulle’s unwillingness to accept a leading US role in Europe violated key norms held by most members of the transatlantic elite. The failure of de Gaulle’s European designs was thus in part the failure to build a consensus amongst European members of the informal alliance. To the American participants, meanwhile, the Bilderberg meetings provided important moments to legitimize US positions and to counter the many Gaullist barbs in the Gaullist-Atlanticist struggle. In all this, the limits of both the informal and the formal alliance were of course also apparent. As long as one crucial member of the alliance was unwilling to pursue an agenda of further integration and cooperation, there was no way the other members could force it. In addition, the fast- in creasing importance of television and the democratization of foreign policy in the"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"258 Alliance in crisis l ong 1960s appeared to chip away at the influence of the transatlantic elite. 119 The Bilderberg Group’s indirect influence relied very much on the authority of its participants; however, it was precisely this authority that was ques - tioned by the 1968 generation. Still, despite the sense that the ‘golden era’ of transatlantic cooperation was over, the Bilderberg Group successfully man - aged the transition to the 1970s and even survived the end of the Cold War. The transatlantic foreign policy elite, in other words, continued to value the informal alliance and what it stood for.

It considered the issue in the spring of 1961, in early 1962, in late 1962 as a result of the Nassau summit, and again in 1963 in the context of the limited test ban negotiations with the Soviet Union. Nitze was involved in several initial discussions with French officials, but the bridge to real cooperation was never crossed. Of course, Nitze and Ball were restricted in what they could tell the Cannes meeting about these attempts to find a solu - tion acceptable to de Gaulle. By 1963, President Kennedy became more and more convinced that relations with de Gaulle would have been far better if he had made “a clear offer of nuclear assistance to France in June of 1961.” Bundy disagreed.

It was unthinkable that she would remain without atomic armaments if the United States, the United Kingdom and even France possessed nuclear weapons. 43 Fo r a recent overview of the Adenauer Government’s attitude, see Geier, Schwellenmacht . 4 4 Ma x Kohnstamm Summary of the Cannes conference, Box 22, Kohnstamm Papers, EUI and Cannes Report, 19, Box 21, Bilderberg Archives, NANL. 45 Ni tze Handwritten Notes, Box 61, Nitze Papers, LOC. 4 6 Ca nnes Report, 13 and 18, Box 21, Bilderberg Archives, NANL. 47 Ar thur Dean Handwritten Notes Cannes, Box 76, Dean Papers, CUL. 4 8 Ca nnes Report, 18, Box 21, Bilderberg Archives, NANL. 49 Ni tze Handwritten Notes Cannes, Box 61, Nitze Papers, LOC. 5 0 Ca nnes Report, 18, Box 21, Bilderberg Archives, NANL. 51 Ca nnes Report, 25, Box 21, Bilderberg Archives, NANL. 52 Va n der Beugel to Kissinger, April 4, 1963, Box 7, Van der Beugel Papers, NANL. 53 Va n der Beugel to Warburg, April 11, 1963, Box 7, Van der Beugel Papers, NANL. 5 4 La mping, “Afterthoughts over Cannes,” July 11, 1963, (my translation) Box 21, Bilderberg Archives, NANL. 55 Ib id. 56 Su mmary Record of National Security Council Meeting, 2 April 1963, Box 314, NSF, J F K L . 57 Ba ll drew several other conclusions from the Cannes meeting.

Second, the American conventional forces strategy in NATO had not convinced the Europeans. “This strategy is being used effectively to under - mine the Eu ropean faith that the U.S. is resolved to use nuclear weapons when required.” Third, many Europeans worried that without a nuclear weapons pro - gram, they would miss out on crucial developments in the peaceful use of nuclear energy.

See also Van der Beugel to Kissinger, January 16, 1964, ibid. Van der Beugel now high - lighted the anti-Gaullist element in the MLF: “The way to demonstrate that we are opponents of De Gaulle’s policy is available in NATO and in eventually joining the multilateral force.” Erler likewise told Walden Moore that he re - garded the MLF as a “clumsy detour.” However, I am not against MLF, because killing it, would open the way for uncon - trolled proliferation. It would be a victory of Gaullist thinking not only in France but everywhere in the Western world. This would be disastrous for the coherence of the Alliance.

Almost seven decades later, the continued existence of the Bilderberg Group suggests that he was onto something. Looking back at its early history, it is evident that the Bilderberg Group served an important function in transatlantic relations as an informal fo - rum for consensus-building and conflict management, grappling with com - plex and interdependent issues such as European integration, the German question, nuclear strategy, decolonization, and East-West relations. The pri - vate nature of the meetings, their excellent organization, and their intimate atmosphere stimulated frank conversations inside and outside of the meet - ing rooms. For Bilderberg’s participants the meetings served as a particu - larly sensitive international barometer, offering subtle indications of mood swings, changing perceptions, and attitudes on both sides of the Atlantic. Although the meetings represented only specific moments in time and were part of much wider debates, the Bilderberg discussions can provide us with important insights into the thinking of the emerging transatlantic foreign policy elite. How the indirect influence of the meetings played out in the wider trans - atlantic relationship can be traced in how certain ideas gained traction, how disagreements were handled, and how certain norms and values came to define the habitus and worldviews of members of the informal alliance. Important examples include the case of European anti-Americanism in the early 1950s, when the Bilderberg Group’s reports and discussions reached the highest levels of the Eisenhower Administration. In the case of the Eur opean Communities, the Bilderberg meetings provided a forum for dis - cussing a European relaunch at a key moment in time, after the dramatic failure of the European Defense Community. In the aftermath of the Suez crisis, the Bilderberg meetings could be used to mend frayed ties and to dis - cuss common responses to decolonization. In the case of the Gaullist chal - lenge to the alliance, the Bilderberg meetings played an important role in the Gaullist-Atlanticist struggle and helped to maintain the internationalist Conclusion"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"Conclusion 265 a pproach behind the Atlantic alliance and the European C ommunities. In terms of American alliance leadership, finally, the Bilderberg meetings pro - vided a space for the kind of informal diplomacy that could be more effec - tive and legitimate than public threats or unilateral decisions. Probably one of the most consequential effects of the Bilderberg meet - ings was the large increase in personal contacts and friendships among the transatlantic foreign policy elite, facilitated by the midcentury revolution in air travel and communications and eased by the cultural compatibility of those who regarded themselves as part of the West. Of course, participating in the meetings held different meanings for different people. Steering com - mittee members valued the meetings differently than one-time participants. Convinced internationalists went to Bilderberg with a different attitude than Gaullist nationalists. Differences in language and culture, moreo - ver, made it easier for some to flourish in the increasingly Anglo-Saxon, En glish-language milieus of the informal alliance than for others (explain - ing, perhaps, the remarkable success of the smaller European nations in being represented in both the formal and the informal alliance). For the majority of Bilderberg members, however, the meetings underscored the im - portance of the global mindset: the willingness to look past national loyal - ties and to devise new ways of international cooperation. The result was a sense of community based on shared emotions, val - ues, and the rhetoric of unity. The informal alliance thus contributed to a broader transatlantic political culture with a distinctly transnational pub - lic sphere. Since the Atlantic alliance ultimately depended on political and public support, it is safe to say that the informal alliance played an impor - tant role in its relative success, adaptability, and endurance. When scholars ask why NATO endures or how it adapts, the informal alliance should be part of the answer. 1 More research of the informal alliance is therefore necessary. Imp ortant organizations such as the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, the At lantic Institute, the Atlantic Council of the United States, the Munich Security Co nference, the Monnet Committee, and the International Institute for St rategic Studies have hardly been studied. In addition, the transnational activities and connections of those most deeply involved in the informal al liance – transatlantic mediators such as George Ball, Kurt Bi rrenbach, Fritz Erler, Joseph Johnson, Denis Healey, Henry Kissinger, Max Ko hnstamm, Guy Mollet, David Rockefeller, Paul-Henri Spaak, or Helmut Schmidt, to name just a few – deserve more attention. It is striking that even biographies of prominent Bilderberg members such as Kissinger and Schmidt ignore the informal alliance. Although Bilderberg’s history after 1968 remains largely hidden, some key moments can be identified. One concerned the decision not to open the group to membership from Japan, as David Rockefeller proposed in the early 1970s. A majority of the steering committee members (particularly in Europe) remained committed to the transatlantic orientation of Bilderberg"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"266 C onclusion and, as a result, Rockefeller and Brzezinski set out to create the Tr i lateral Commission – a development supported by most Bilderbergers. 2 Not sur - prisingly, the membership between the two organizations overlapped considerably. Another key moment was the 1976 Lockheed scandal, concerning Prince Bernhard’s acceptance of more than a million dollars in what appeared to be bribes. American Bilderbergers, probably still reeling from the Wat ergate scandal, were particularly indignant in their response and argued that Bilderberg should not be allowed to be associated with the scandal. The 1976 Bilderberg meeting was scheduled to take place in the United States and Ar thur Dean warned of serious consequences if nothing was done. Ev entually, Ernst van der Beugel had to tell Prince Bernhard that he had to resign as chairman. 3 Some Bilderbergers assumed that this would be the end of the group. Rockefeller and Brzezinski even discussed a plan to use the Trilateral Commission to launch an alternative Bilderberg. 4 Yet although the 1976 meeting was cancelled, a relaunch took place in 1977. German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt was one of those arguing strongly in favor of the continuation of the Bilderberg meetings. 5 Schmidt had also been a driv - ing force behind the creation of the G7 meetings in 1975, perhaps inspired by his Bilderberg experiences. Many of the so-called G7 Sherpas responsible for coordinating the meetings were members of the informal alliance. 6 After the end of the Cold War, the idea that the United States and Europe should, wherever possible, find joint responses to the major problems fac - ing the world remained a powerful one. The continued US commitment to Eu rope’s defense was visible in an expanding NATO. Of course, the fact that the Cold War was over did not necessarily mean that transatlantic relations were suddenly harmonious. The George W. Bush Administration’s 2002 decision to invade Iraq caused a major transatlantic crisis. Based on the number of US officials present at the following year’s Bilderberg meeting, and judging by press reports, the Bilderberg Group (like the more public Mu nich Security Conference) was one of the key venues where the trans - atlantic Iraq debate played out. 7 The limits of the Bilderberg method were apparent in the failure of major transatlantic partners to agree. The Bilderberg Group has long been a favorite target of conspiracy the - orists, stirred by Bilderberg’s secretive nature and the quality of its par - ticipants. The group is frequently accused of fomenting war, disease, and financial crises around the world. Such conspiracy theories are typically based on a mix of conjecture and falsehoods and their authors care little for the historical record. Starting with Phyllis Schlafly writing about the 1957 St. Simons Island conference, many of these conspiracy theories have been driven by extreme right-wing nationalist forces such as the John Birch Society in the United States. With websites like Infowars and Breitbart , these forces have become influential voices in populist, anti-globalist movements reaching into the Trump White House."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"Conclusion 267 A nti-establishment sentiment is an important component of these move - ments and finds frequent expression in the rejection of the global elites who meet at Bilderberg, Davos, or Munich. Anti-European groups have simi - larly used the Bilderberg meetings as proof that the European Communities were a secret elite project funded by the CIA. In recent years, Russian prop - agandists have also recognized the power of anti-establishment sentiment and have used the alleged misdeeds of the Bilderberg Group for their desta- bilizing purposes. 8 In many of these conspiracy theories, older, anti-Semitic tropes about high finance play a considerable role. This book will not convince the conspiracy theorists, but it may help to steer public debates about Bilderberg and other transnational elite organi - zations in a more constructive direction. After all, even if Bilderberg is not a secret world government or capitalist plot, it is still legitimate to question its influence. Bilderberg contributed to complex processes of coordination and consensus building and it helped create a closely interconnected transatlan - tic elite, including a significant number of wealthy captains of industry and bankers. Democratically elected politicians who participated in the meet - ings were no more immune to this kind of indirect mutual influence than other Bilderberg members. In the end, the question is whether the benefits of increased international understanding outweigh the risks that politicians are unduly influenced or democratic processes are subverted. Based on the history of Bilderberg’s first decades, those risks appear to be small as long as the Bilderberg or - ganizers ensure that different political and societal groups are sufficiently represented. The benefits of the Bilderberg Group are difficult to calculate, but at least for those who favor close transatlantic cooperation, the meetings seem to have served a useful purpose.
