This a 2016look at what transpired over 25 years ago!How does Bill Cooper’s message stand up today?What secrets can we glean from it in light of what we now know today?Be advised, this is not just about “Behold a Pale Horse,” This is about thewhole life ofWilliam Cooper and the secrets I’ve discovered in his other writings as well!This book was written to make public as much information as possible about WiliamCooper. In doing so it is not my intention to condone or condemn any of Mr.Coopersactions or ideas. But I personal y believe that taking the stand that he did wasnot in thebest interest of himself, his family, his fel ow citizens and his cause.While some of us may not approve of certain activities of our government, therearebetter ways to work for change. Going beyond airing our grievances and cal ingattention to what we feel is wrong with the government and engaging in il egalorviolent activities should never be considered. While I never met Mr. Cooper, Ihaverespect for what he stood for in the beginning, but over time he seems to havelost itand become irrational. Was he actual y suffering from some kind of psychologicalorphysical problem?There are a lot of things in the life of William Cooper that just don’t make alot of sense.For example: In his book he claims that on the second attempt by the CIA tosilencehim, he was run off the road by the same black limo and lost his leg in theaccident. Inthe obituary in the Sierra Times they state that he lost his leg in themilitary. OK, theycould have gotten it wrong, but I’ve included on page 113 a statement to the FBIfromsomeone I believe to be a family member of his who claims that it was from amotorcycle accident and that Bill Cooper went around a corner too fast and hit atruck.OK, what gives? Does this inconsistency have any bearing on the facts hepresents?When it comes to elaborate, convoluted conspiracy theories, no one can beat WiliamMilton Cooper, the most infamous UFO, conspiracy theorist!His 1991 book: “Behold a Pale Horse” is among the most influential of all super-conspiracy books to be found in bookstores around the country! Not only muchread inUFO circles, but also popular with the militia crowd.While his book is ful of conspiracy theories, UFOs seem to remain the focus. Andthoseextraterrestrials are plotting with the New World Order to control the World!Plus, therehas been an “invasion from outer space hoax” planned since 1970 by the Iluminati.And the only thing that could save us from a very dim future was for us to cutback onthe population, slow down technology and economic growth, cut meat out of ourdietand prepare for a complete paradigm shift in our evolutionary humanconsciousness,…sounds reasonable to me!3[index-4_1.png][index-4_2.png][index-4_3.png][index-4_4.png]Did It start when Cooper was assigned to Naval Intelligence and saw evidencethatNaval Intel igence was involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy? Did theshockand repulsion of all this shape his future distrust of the government, or was heborn afree soul that could not be tamed?The late Wil iam Cooper was a former United States Naval Intelligence officer,authorand short-wave radio broadcaster from Eagar, Arizona. He was on the FBI’s “watchlist”for such activities as frequently condemning the government for their actions atWacoand Ruby Ridge as wel as his obsession that the government was involved in aconspiracy to establish a “New World Order.” (Guess it didn’t help thatPresidentGeorge Bush once mentioned that we were establishing a New World Order!)Then he really raised a red flag in 1997 when he referred to the Oklahoma Citybombing as a false flag attack by criminal elements of our government.The Clinton White House named Cooper “The most dangerous radio host in America.”When a Deputy Marshall had attempted to serve Cooper with a summons on06/19/1998, Cooper threw him off his property without receiving the summons.Eventual y, a bench warrant for his arrest was issued for not appearing in courton asummons which was never served, leading to an intense surveil ance operation.This intense FBI surveil ance of Cooper’s household included multiple FBImeetings,undercover agents posing as journalists, monitoring of his internet publishing,as wel astestimonies from personal acquaintances and local store owners. Aerial photosweretaken of his ranch.Apache County Sheriff Arthur Lee was concerned that federal agents werepreparingfor a siege on Cooper’s home in order to bring him in. When asked if Lee thoughtCooper represented a threat to the community, the sheriff responded that hebelieved,“Cooper could live in that community for the next 50 years and never receive atrafficticket”. He went on to tell the FBI that he does not want a Ruby Ridge Scenariotodevelop in his county.After an anonymous tip came into local law enforcement which claimed Cooperchased two individuals off of a nearby property using a firearm, they decided totakeaction and raid Cooper’s home in plain clothes, leading to his controversialdeath.4[index-5_1.png][index-5_2.png][index-5_3.png][index-5_4.png][index-5_5.png][index-5_6.png][index-5_7.png]–As you read his book “Behold a Pale Horse” published in 1991, you get theimpressionthat he was out to protect America from treasonous acts by our governmentitself.Then, as you near the end of the book, you just may feel that you yourself wereclose tobeing involved in a treasonous conspiracy with Mr. Cooper!Personal y, the first time I read “Behold a Pale Horse,” around four years ago,I wasfeeling “Right on, Mr. Cooper” somebody has finally got it right and he has theanswers,but somewhere later in the book, I started to worry that maybe he had flippedout. Butthis isn’t necessarily an insult directed towards him, it just may mean that,like manyothers, I wasn’t ready for where his fast-paced revelation was taking me.Cooper writes about the coming New World Order, and the Plan, which the \"PowerElite\" of this country and this world are implementing, that wil bring about theGlobalGovernment, Economy, and Religion. Of course Cooper is dead set against thiscomingglobal government, and reveals how the Plan has been proceeding. His book is adetailed research into government corruption, secret societies and conspiracies.Cooper is able to reveal first-hand information based on his career in U.S.NavalIntelligence, on the Government’s efforts to implement this global system ofGovernment, Economy, and Religion.Those of us who have risen above the sheep mentality just may consider “Behold aPaleHorse” to be the most important insider revelation concerning the plan toproduce theNew World Order in al its violence, death and destruction. After all, It is themostquoted book on the Il uminati.Wil iam Cooper offers a lengthy analysis of the state of global events,presentinginformation, which he claims is secretly held by governments. And he argues thatnumerous secret societies exist, which were organized into a single massivesocietyaround 1953; that a Secret Government, which controls everything, wasestablishedshortly after World War I ; that the government seeks to eliminate populationthroughvarious means and that extraterrestrial intelligent life exists and often visitsearth. (Wow!) In addition, Cooper offers auto-biographical information andproffers a plethora ofputative facts regarding the massive and systematic disinformation campaignwagedupon the public by those in power.Cooper claims that shortly after World War I , the United States governmentestablisheda Secret Government, which persists into the present time. The Secret Governmentisthe actual control ing power of global politics and has the single goal ofestablishing aglobal, totalitarian socialist state—a modified version of Nazi Germany'sFascism. Sincetime immemorial, various secret societies have existed; they are based upon the5worship of the Biblical Lucifer, and the members of these societies seekpersonal knowledge or il umination—hence they are collectively referred to asthe Il uminati.After World War II, al of these disparate secret societies were brought togetherin asingle organizational structure known as the Bilderberg Group. The exact natureof therelationship between the Bilderberg Group and the Secret Government is difficulttofathom and obscure; the fact, however, is that both groups have similar goalsandstrategies and both groups are heavily infiltrated by members of the othergroup.In most of the text, Cooper seems to suggest that the two groups are, in fact,the sameorganization. Finally, the existence of UFOs and alien life forms wasestablished shortlyafter World War II. Realizing that such knowledge would cause widespread panic,thegovernment decided to keep it secret. Vast networks of bases and entireorganizationsof personnel were subsequently organized to contain the alien situation, andpoliticaltreaties were signed with alien nations.Today, the Secret Government seeks to dominate the alien presence and carry outitssecret program of world domination.Does Mr. Cooper go too far in the many al egations against public officials? Asanexample, Cooper denigrates Pope John Paul II as a Nazi poison-gas salesman, whohelped engineer HIV and deliberately distributed the virus in vaccinations. Doesthereexist a lack of credible supporting documentation to back up Mr. Cooper’sclaims?Chapter 3 – Inside “Behold a Pale Horse” chapter by chapterFrom the forward to “Behold a Pale Horse”Cooper’s first mention of spotting a UFO at sea aboard a submarine would be aremarkable well-documented incident if the photos and statements were everreleasedto the public.It is interesting how we are given the impression by the government that UFOsdon’texist and the government isn’t interested in them and contrast that with howserious themilitary takes them and the threats they use to make sure no one reveals whattheyobserved:I had seen a flying saucer the size of an aircraft carrier come right out of theocean and fly into the clouds. I looked around quickly to see if anyone else hadseen it. Ensign Bal was stil bending over the IMC. He was ordering coffee.Geronimo was looking downthe starboard side aft. I was torn between my duty to report what I had seen andtheknowledge that if I did no one would believe me. As I looked out over the oceanI sawonly sky, clouds, and water. It was as if nothing had happened. I almost thoughtI haddreamed it.6[index-7_1.jpg][index-7_2.jpg]These photos taken from a submarine, while presumably not from the one Cooperwas on, closelyresemble what he had described. More info and photos of this sub/UFO encountercan be found on:http://www.blue-planet-project.com/UFO-Seen-By-US-Navy-Submarine.html[http://www.blue-planet-project.com/UFO-Seen-By-US-Navy-Submarine.html]Ensign Ball straightened, turned toward Geronimo and said the coffee was on thewayup. I looked back toward the spot, about 15 degrees relative off the port bow,andabout 2-1/2 nautical miles distant. Nothing, not even a hint of what hadhappened.\"Ensign Bal ,\" I said, \"I thought I saw something about 15 degrees relative offthe bow, but I lost it. Can you help me look over that area?\" Ensign Ballturned, raising his glasses to eye level. I didn't know it at the time, butGeronimo had heard me and turned tolook. He was happy that something had broken the monotony. I was just liftingthebinoculars off my chest when I saw it. The giant saucer shape plunged out of theclouds, tumbled, and, pushing the water before it, opened up a hole in the oceananddisappeared from view. It was incredible.This time I had seen it with my naked eyes, and its size, in comparison with thetotalview, was nothing short of astounding. Ensign Hal stood in shock, his binocularsin hishands, his mouth open. Geronimo yelled, \"Holy shit! What the — hey! did you guysseethat?\" Ensign Bal turned, and looking right at me with the most incredulous lookon his face, said in a low voice, \"This had to happen on my watch!\" He turned,quickly pressing the override on the IMC and yelled, \"Captain to the bridge,Captain to the bridge.\" As an afterthought he pressed the switch again andyelled, \"Somebody get a camera uphere.\"The Captain surged up the ladder with the quartermaster on his heels. ChiefQuartermaster Quintero had the ship's 35-mm camera slung around his neck. TheCaptain stood patiently while Ensign Bal tried to describe what he had seen. Heglanced at us and we both nodded in affirmation. That was enough for theCaptain.He cal ed sonar, who during the excitement had reported contact underwater atthesame bearing. The Captain announced into the 1MC, \"This is the Captain. I havetheconn.\" The reply came back instantly from the helm, \"aye, aye sir.\"7I knew that the helmsman was passing the word in the control room that theCaptain had personal y taken control of the boat. I also knew that rumors wereprobably flyingthrough the vessel.The Captain cal ed down and ordered someone to closely monitor the radar. Hiscommand was instantly acknowledged. As the five of us stood gazing out over thesea,the same ship or one exactly like it rose slowly, turned in the air, tilted atan angle and then vanished. I saw the Chief snapping pictures out of the cornerof my eye. This time Ihad three images from which to draw conclusions. It was a metal machine, of thatthere was no doubt whatsoever. It was intelligently control ed; of that I wasequally sure.It was a dull color, kind of like pewter. There were no lights. There was noglow. I thought I had seen a row of what looked like portholes, but could not becertain.Radar reported contact at the same bearing and gave us a range of 3 nauticalmiles.The range was right on, as the craft had moved toward the general direction thatwewere headed. We watched repeatedly as the strange craft reentered the water andthen subsequently rose into the clouds over and over again until finally we knewthat itwas gone for good. The episode lasted about 10 minutes. Before leaving thebridge,the Captain took the camera from the Chief and instructed each of us not to talktoanyone about what we had seen. He told us the incident was classified and wewerenot to discuss it, not even amongst ourselves.We acknowledged his order. The Captain and the Chief left the bridge. Ensign Balstepped to the 1MC and, pressing the override switch, announced, \"This is EnsignBal .The Captain has left the bridge. I have the conn.\" The reply, \"aye aye sir,\"quickly followed. Those of us who had witnessed the UFO were not allowed to goashore afterwe had berthed in Pearl. Even those of us who didn't have the duty were told wehadto stay aboard. After about two hours, a commander from the Office of NavalIntelligence boarded. He went directly to the Captain's stateroom. It wasn'tlong beforewe were called to wait in the passageway outside the Captain's door.Ensign Ball was cal ed first. After about 10 minutes he came out and went intothewardroom. He looked shaken. I was next. When I entered the stateroom, theCommander was holding my service record in his hands. He wanted to know why Ihadgone from the Air Force into the Navy. I told him the whole story and he laughedwhen Isaid that after putting off the Navy for fear of chronic seasickness, I hadn'tbeen seasick yet. Suddenly a mask dropped over his face, and looking me directlyin the eyes heasked, \"What did you see out there?\"\"I believe it was a flying saucer, sir,\" I answered. The man began to visiblyshake and he screamed obscenities at me. He threatened to put me in the brig forthe rest of my life. I thought he wasn't going to stop yelling, but as suddenlyas he began, he stopped. I wasconfused. I had answered his question truthful y; yet I was threatened withprison. I wasnot afraid, but I was not very confident, either. I figured I had better takeanother tack.Eighteen years with my father and four years in the Air Force had taught mesomething.8Number one was that officers just do not lose control like that, ever. Numbertwo was that if my answer had elicited that explosion, then the next thing outof my mouth hadbetter be something entirely different. Number three was, that his response hadbeenan act of kindness to get me to arrive at exactly that conclusion. \"Let's startal over again,\" he said. \"What did you see out there?\" \"Nothing, sir,\" Ianswered. \"I didn't see a damn thing, and I'd like to get out of here just assoon as possible.\" A smile spread over his face and the Captain looked relieved.\"Are you sure, Cooper?\" he asked. \"Yes sir,\" I replied, \"I'm sure.\" \"You're agood sailor, Cooper,\" he said. 'The Navy needs men like you, You'l go far withthe Navy.\"He then asked me to read several pieces of paper that al said the same thingonly withdifferent words. I read that if I ever talked about what it was that I didn'tsee, I could be fined up to $10,000 and imprisoned for up to 10 years or both.In addition, I could lose al pay and allowances due or ever to become due. Heasked me to sign a piece ofpaper stating that I understood the laws and regulations that I had just readgoverningthe safeguard of classified information relating to the national security. Bysigning, Iagreed never to communicate in any manner any information regarding the incidentwith anyone. I was dismissed, and boy, was I glad to get out of there.And Cooper reports on UFOs in Vietnam! Were they there to observe the war?The whole time that I was in Vietnam and especially on the DMZ, I had noticedthatthere was a lot of UFO activity. We had individual 24-hour crypto code sheetsthat weused to encode messages, but because of the danger that one of them could becaptured at any time, we used special code words for sensitive information.UFOs, Iwas told, were definitely sensitive information. I learned exactly how sensitivewhen allthe people of an entire vil age disappeared after UFOs were seen hovering abovetheirhuts. I learned that both sides had fired upon the UFOs, and they had blastedback witha mysterious blue light. Rumors floated around that UFOs had kidnapped andmutilatedtwo army soldiers, then dropped them in the bush. No one knew how much of thiswastrue, but the fact that the rumors persisted made me tend to think there was atleastsome truth in them. I found out later that most of those rumors were true.The Kennedy Assassination:You may be surprised that Cooper had access to some of this information, but youmustrealize that he claimed to have Top Secret, Q Clearance and was later givenanotherupgraded clearance in the crypto category and served as the designated SPECAToperator when on watch in the command center.“On the day that I learned that the Office of Naval Intelligence hadparticipated in theassassination of President John F. Kennedy and that it was the Secret Serviceagentdriving the limo that had shot Kennedy in the head, I went AWOL with nointention ofever returning.”9[index-10_1.jpg]Shocked by the statement that a Secret Service agent may have fired the finalshot?You are not alone. It is hard to believe something like that and this may havecausedsome folks to dismiss Wil iam Cooper as a kook. But there is a film of theassassination, it is cal ed the “Zapruder Film” which they claim documents this.Although I haven’tpersonal y viewed it, I have heard of several who have viewed the original film,beforethat revealing section was edited out.Cooper asserted that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated because he wasabout to reveal that extraterrestrials were in the process of taking over theEarth.According to a \"top secret\" video of the assassination that Cooper claimed tohavediscovered, the driver of the presidential limousine, Wil iam Greer, used “a gaspressuredevice developed by aliens from the Trilateral Commission” to shoot thepresident fromthe driver's seat. The Zapruder film shows Greer twice turning to look into theback seatof the car; Cooper theorized that Greer first turned to assess Kennedy's statusafter theexternal attack, and then to fire the fatal shot.But some have a different opinion on this information in Behold a Pale Horse.You mayfind this information interesting:Conspiracy theories implicating Greer reportedly \"snowbal ed\" after publicationof Behold a Pale Horse. Cooper's video purporting to prove his theory wasanalyzed byseveral television stations, according to one source, and was found to be \"... apoor-quality fake using chunks of the ... Zapruder film.\"Confused? Let’s dig deeper into that Zapruder Film…The Zapruder FilmThe Zapruder film is a silent, color motion picture sequence shot by privatecitizen Abraham Zapruder with a home-movie camera, as U.S. President John F.Kennedy's motorcade passed through Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas, on November22,1963, thereby unexpectedlycapturing the President'sassassination.Although it is not the only film ofthe shooting, it has been cal edthe most complete, giving arelatively clear view from asomewhat elevated position onthe side from which the president'shead wound is visible. It was animportant part of the WarrenCommission hearings and allFrame 150 from Zapruder Filmsubsequent investigations of the10[index-11_1.jpg]assassination, and is one of the most studied pieces of film in history. Ofgreatestnotoriety is the film's capture of the fatal shot to President Kennedy's headwhenhis presidential limousine was almost exactly in front of, and slightly below,Zapruder'sposition.Frame 371 from Zapruder FilmAbraham Zapruder stood on a concrete pedestal along Elm Street in Dealey Plazaholding a high-end Model 414 PD Bel & Howel Zoomatic Director Series Camera. Hefilmed from the time the presidential limousine turned onto Elm Street for atotal of26.6 seconds, exposing 486 frames of standard 8 mm Kodachrome II safety film,runningat 18.3 frames/second.After Secret Service agent Forrest Sorrels promised Zapruder that the film wouldonly beused for an official investigation, the two men sought to develop the footage assoonas possible. As television station WFAA's equipment was incompatible with theformat, Eastman Kodak's Dallas film processing facility developed the film andJamiesonFilm Company produced three copies. Zapruder gave two of the copies to theSecretService.On the morning of November 23, CBS lost the bidding for the footage to Lifemagazine's$150,000 offer. Rather was the first to report on the footage on nationaltelevision afterseeing it, although the inaccuracies in his description would contribute tomany conspiracy theories about the assassination.Frame 313 of the film depicts the fatal shot to the President's head. Zapruderinsistedthat frame 313 be excluded from publication.11[index-12_1.jpg]Volume 18 of the Warren Commission's hearings reproduced 158 frames of theZapruderfilm in black and white. However, frames 208–211 were missing, a splice wasvisible inframes 207 and 212, frames 314 and 315 were switched, and frame 284 was a repeatof283. In reply to an inquiry, the FBI's J. Edgar Hoover wrote in 1965 that 314and 315 wereswitched due to a printing error, and that the error did not exist in theoriginal WarrenCommission exhibits.In early1967, Life released astatement that fourframes of thecamera original(208–211) had beenaccidental ydestroyed, and theadjacent framesdamaged, bya Life photo labtechnician onNovember 23, 1963.Life released themissing frames fromthe first-generationcopy it had receivedfrom Zapruder withthe original. (Of theZapruder frames outside the section used in the commission's exhibits, frames155–157and 341 were also damaged and spliced out of the camera original, but arepresent inthe first-generation copies.)Holland and Rush point out that Zapruder temporarily stopped filming at frame132,when only police motorcycles were visible. When he resumed filming, frame 133already shows the presidential motorcade in view. This pause could have greatsignificance for the interpretation of the assassination, Holland and Rushsuggest.(NOTE: For those of you who doubt the information provided by Cooper on theassassination, UFOs, the New World Order, and Il uminati, explain why he wasforced offthe road twice by the same black limousine and left for dead? Did he make thatup?The second attempt caused the loss of his leg, that’s hard to fake!)12Behold a Pale Horse Chapter 1: \"Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars\"This chapter presents a document entitled 'TOP SECRET - Silent Weapons for QuietWars -An introductory programming manual - Operations Research - Technical Manual -TM-SW7905.1.Cooper retitles the document 'The Il uminati's declaration of War upon thepeople ofAmerica' and notes that it was dated May 1979. Cooper explains that the documentwas found inside a used, photocopy machine, which was purchased as surplusproperty in 1986.According to Cooper, the document conclusively demonstrates that a reputed ThirdWorld War commenced in 1954; the war pits a shadowy organization known as theBilderberg Group against the governments of the world. The Bilderberg Group usesamethod of warfare known as \"quiet war\"—their weapons are information,disinformation and control, instead of traditional explosives.Very strange,,, While I’m not one to doubt Wil iam Cooper, this sounds awful yconvenient that it landed in his lap just like that!Actually this is really an amazing document, and we wil dig into shortly as soonas Iexplain a little more about where it came from.Mr. Cooper further explains: “I read Top Secret documents which explained that\"Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars\" is the doctrine adopted by the Policy Committeeof theBilderberg Group during its first known meeting in 1954. A copy found in 1969was in thepossession of Naval Intelligence. The following document, dated May 1979, wasfoundon July 7,1986, in an IBM copier that had been purchased at a surplus sale.”I wish he had explained a little more about coming into possession of thisdocument.Did he buy the copier or did someone else find it and he then obtained it?Although thisline at the beginning of the manuscript may be a clue as to its origin: “Copyfurnishedby Mr. Tom Young, A Fellow Warrior in the cause of Freedom” Why do I have thishunchthat he just might have “borrowed” this document from the files of the office ofNavalIntelligence?Was Navy Intel igence investigating this documenting as a threat to our countryor werethey somehow trying to figure out how to eventual y adapt to it? I’m a bitconfusedbecause the original title of this document makes it appear to be a governmenthandbook for adapting to the New World Order changes, rather than aninvestigationinto the Bilderbergers as Mr. Cooper seem to suggest.So, is this a threat coming from outside the U.S.? A threat directed at us fromal or partof our government? Or a threat directed towards this world from off-worlderswith thehelp of some of the leaders of this World?Here’s more info on this that I just discovered: Wil iam Cooper’s 1991publication wasnot the first SWFQW publishing event. The original America’s Promise NewsletterofNovember 1986 stated that the said copy machine was purchased at auction fromthe13McChord Air Force Base (located near Fort Lewis) in Washington State, by aBoeing employee (Tom Young) and passed on to Cooper. (Now that makes moresense.)Cooper might have read SWFQW in a \"Naval Intel igence Majority Twelve File.\"Delamar Duverus of the American Sunbeam made a similar claim. Also refer toLeontiefeconomics project, (e.g., Rockefel er (1948) - SWFQW, page 5).And now, the original author, Hartford Van Dyke, has stated that he original yhad tokeep a low profile because of the government, and published it anonymously.He states that: “SWFQW is a collage, an overlay and paste-up of the works andwordsof many authors. I was the author only in the sense that I compiled and linkedthe gemsof other writers. The book is not a hoax. Wassily W. Leontief proved the contentof SWFQW by his article in the September 1980 issue of Scientific American,entitled ‘Theworld Economy in the Year 2000.’ Leontief was the father of the Silent WeaponsSystem,and was awarded the 1973 Nobel Prize in Economics long after his creation (1948)became recognized by the elite to be a weapon (1965).”“Years passing do not change the invariant truths of science, not even ofeconomicscience. The elite were never ful y named in SWFQW. It was not necessary to namethem specifically.

Such a writing must beSECUREDFROM PUBLIC SCRUTINY. Otherwise, it might be recognized as a TECHNICALLY FORMALDECLARATION OF DOMESTIC WAR.

The original purpose of Operations Research wastostudy the strategic and tactical problems of air and land defense with theobjective ofeffective use of limited military resources against foreign enemies (i.e.,logistics). It wassoon recognized by those in positions of power [THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGNRELATIONS]that the same methods might be useful for totally control ing a society. Butbetter toolswere necessary."},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO ECONOMIC AMPLIFIERSEconomic amplifiers are the active components of economic engineering. The basiccharacteristic of any amplifier (mechanical, electrical, or economic) is that itreceivesan input control signal and delivers energy from an independent energy source toaspecified output terminal in a predictable relationship to that input controlsignal. Thesimplest form of economic amplifier is a device cal ed advertising.If a person is spoken to by a T.V. advertiser as if he were a twelve-year- old,then, due tosuggestibility, he wil , with a certain probability, respond or react to thatsuggestion withthe uncritical response of a twelve-year-old and wil reach into his economicreservoirand deliver its energy to buy that product on impulse when he passes it in thestore.15An economic amplifier may have several inputs and outputs. Its response might beinstantaneous or delayed. Its circuit symbol might be a rotary switch if itsoptions areexclusive, qualitative, \"go\" or \"no go,\" or it might have its parametricinput/output relationships specified by a matrix with internal energy sourcesrepresented.Whatever its form might be, its purpose is to govern the flow of energy from asource toan output sink in direct relationship to an input control signal. For thisreason, it is cal ed an active circuit element or component.Economic Amplifiers fal into classes cal ed strategies, and, in comparison withelectronic amplifiers, the specific internal functions of an economic amplifierare cal edlogistical instead of electrical.Therefore, economic amplifiers not only deliver power gain but also, in effect,are usedto cause changes in the economic circuitry.In the design of an economic amplifier we must have some idea of at least fivefunctions, which are:(1) the available input signals(2) the desired output-control objectives(3) the strategic objective(4) the available economic power sources(5) the logistical optionsThe process of defining and evaluating these factors and incorporating theeconomicamplifier into an economic system has been popularly called GAME THEORY.The design of an economic amplifier begins with a specification of the powerlevel ofthe output, which can range from personal to national. The second condition isaccuracy of response, i.e., how accurately the output action is a function ofthe inputcommands. High gain combined with strong feedback helps to deliver the requiredprecision.Most of the error wil be in the input data signal. Personal input data tends tobespecific, while national input data tends to be statistical.SHORT LIST OF INPUTS Questions to be answered:(1) what (2) when (3) where (4) how (5) why (6) whoGeneral sources of information:(1) telephone taps (2) surveillance (3) analysis of garbage (4) behavior ofchildren inschoolStandard of living by: (l)food (2) clothing (3) shelter (4) transportation16Social contacts: (1) telephone — itemized record of calls (2) family — marriagecertificates, birth certificates, etc. friends, associates, etc. (4) membershipsinorganizations (5) political affiliationTHE PERSONAL PAPER TRAIL Personal buying habits, i.e., personal consumerpreferences:(1) checking accounts(2) credit-card purchases(3) \"tagged\" credit-card purchases — the credit-card purchase of productsbearing the U.P.C.

sabotaging their mental activities; providing alow-qualityprogram of public education in mathematics, logic, systems design and economics;and discouraging technical creativity.(2) engaging their emotions, increasing their self-indulgence and theirindulgence inemotional and physical activities, by:(a) unrelenting emotional affrontations and attacks (mental and emotionalrape) by way of a constant barrage of sex, violence, and wars in the media —especial y the T.V. and the newspapers.(b) giving them what they desire — in excess — \"junk food for thought\" — anddepriving them of what they real y need.21(3) REWRITING HISTORY and LAW and SUBJECTING THE PUBLIC TO THE DEVIANTCREATION, thus being able to SHIFT THEIR THINKING from personal needs to highlyfabricated outside priorities.These preclude their interest in and discovery of the silent weapons of socialautomation technology.The general rule is that there is profit in confusion; the more confusion, themore profit.Therefore, the best approach is to create problems and then offer the solutions.DIVERSION SUMMARYMedia: Keep the adult public attention diverted away from the real socialissues, andcaptivated by matters of no real importance.Schools: Keep the young public ignorant of real mathematics, real economics,real law,and REAL HISTORY.Entertainment: Keep the public entertainment below a sixth-grade level.Work: Keep the public busy, busy, busy, with no time to think; back on the farmwith theother animals.CONSENT, THE PRIMARY VICTORYA silent weapon system operates upon data obtained from a docile public by legal(but not always lawful) force. Much information is made available to silentweaponsystems programmers through the Internal Revenue Service. (See Studies in theStructureof the American Economy for an I.R.S. source list.)This information consists of the enforced delivery of well-organized datacontained infederal and state tax forms col ected, assembled, and submitted by slave laborprovided by taxpayers and employers.Furthermore, the number of such forms submitted to the I.R.S. is a usefulindicator ofpublic consent, an important factor in strategic decision making. Other datasourcesare given in the Short List of Inputs.Consent Coefficients — numerical feedback indicating victory status.Psychologicalbasis: When the government is able to collect tax and seize private propertywithout justcompensation, it is an indication that the public is ripe for surrender and isconsenting toenslavement and legal encroachment. A good and easily quantified indicator ofharvest time is the number of public citizens who pay income tax despite anobviouslack of reciprocal or honest service from the government.22(Be sure to take me up on my offer to at the beginning of this book to downloada free PDF copy of Cooper’s Behold a Pale Horse. And read the document “found inthecopier” in full. This document he found is very long and detailed and I haveonly beenable to scratch the surface here. -Gil)I have to tell you that I’m getting a little tired of all the talk aboutBilderbergers and The Il uminati. Sure, I believe there is a secret group orgroups that are actual y running ourcountry, and maybe the World from the shadows. But who or what they are, I cantelyou, is certainly not the Bilderbergers and The Il uminati at least not anymore.These groups that have become household words, may just be a ruse, a distractionfrom the real groups. Whomever is real y running things would be too smart to beseengoing to meetings in hotels. If these Bilderbergers and Il uminati folks arereallyconnected to the secret forces behind all this, they are just a low level groupofservants.I can tel you right now that the real powers that rule things are notBilderbergers,Il uminati, Masons or the rest of these secret organizations, the actual powerholders areoff-worlders! Its not these groups that run things. These groups would becomparable tochurch members worshiping God. Those church members don’t have the power orauthority that comes from the God they worship, in spite of what they have beentold.And the same goes for the secret groups, they are not the real power, they justserve it.Behold a Pale Horse Chapter 2: \"Secret Societies and the New World Order\"Chapter two presents a rather cohesive analysis of secret societies and theirtypicalcomposition. Such societies have always existed, and they function primarilybecauseall people want to belong to such societies because they want to feel that theyare amember of an elite group possessed of superior knowledge. The societies arebasedaround repetitive levels of ritual and secret initiation. This ensures that mostmembers ofthe lower circles of the society wil never progress and are simply uninformedlabor tobe exploited by the upper circles of the society.Cooper alleges that the original secret society was known as the Brotherhood oftheSnake, a society based upon the worship of the Judeo-Christian, Lucifer, who isconsidered to be the source.Here’s how Mr. Cooper explains it:“The oldest is the Brotherhood of the Snake, also called the Brotherhood of theDragon,and it stil exists under many different names. The Brother hood of the Snake isdevotedto guarding the \"secrets of the ages\" and to the recognition of Lucifer as theone and only true God. If you do not believe in God, Lucifer, or Satan, you mustunderstand thatthere are great masses of people who do. I do not believe in racism but mil ionsdo andtheir beliefs and actions based upon those beliefs wil affect me. It is clearthat religion has always played a significant role in the course of theseorganizations.23Communication with a higher source, often divine, is a familiar claim in all buta few.The secrets of these groups are thought to be so profound that only a chosen,well-educated few are able to understand and use them. These men use their specialknowledge for the benefit of al mankind. At least that is what they claim. Howare weto know, since their knowledge and actions have been secret? Fortunately, someof ithas become public knowledge.”This chapter from Mr. Cooper’s book shows how deep his knowledge of secretsocietiesreal y is! I found the fol owing paragraph to be especial y interesting:“A method of deciding exactly who is to become an adept may be decided duringinitiation by asking the candidate to spit upon the Christian cross. If thecandidaterefuses, the members congratulate him and tell him, \"You have made the rightchoice,as a true adept would never do such a terrible thing.\" The newly initiated mightfind it disconcerting, however, that he/she never advances any higher. Ifinstead, thecandidate spits upon the cross, he/she has demonstrated a knowledge of one ofthemysteries and soon wil find him/herself a candidate for the next higher level.Themystery is that religion is but a tool to control the masses. Knowledge (orwisdom) is their only god, through which man himself wil become god. The snakeand the dragon areboth symbols of wisdom. Lucifer is the personification of the symbol. It wasLucifer whotempted Eve to entice Adam to eat of the tree of knowledge and thus free manfromthe bonds of ignorance. The WORSHIP (a lot different from STUDY) of knowledge,science, or technology is Satanism in its purest form, and its god is Lucifer.Its secretsymbol is the al -seeing eye in the pyramid.”But don’t be distracted by all this information about secret societies, alwaysremainaware of the Alien agenda which is to control our world through the secretsocietieswho in turn manipulate people through Occult groups, religion, Satanism and whathave you.Behold a Pale Horse Chapter 3:\"Oath of Initiation of an Unidentified Secret Order\"In this chapter a document is presented which Cooper received from an anonymouswoman. It purports to be an oath of allegiance to the Jesuits or to the Knightsof Malta.In the oath, the recipient is bound to the society upon pain of death andeverlastingtorment and agrees to freely and whol y subjugate his personal wil to that ofhissuperiors. He agrees that the relentless murder and torture of anyone outside ofthesociety is not sinful or wrong and promises to always do what is in the bestinterest of thesociety on pain of death. One strange aspect of the oath is that the recipientdeclaresthat it applies to them \"even as a corpse or cadaver (perinde ac cadaver).\"Oaths of initiation are required in al secret societies. They are what keep themembersunder complete control. Here, you’l read an authentic oath, which gives completeallegiance to the Pope, the sacred Mother Church of Rome (Vatican), and to Jesus24Christ (although, anyone who knows the teachings of Jesus know that this oath iscompletely anti-Christian). The reason this is included in the book, is to provethat suchoaths do in fact exist and are subversive.Behold a Pale Horse Chapter 4: \"Secret Treaty of Verona\"In this chapter he presents extracted text from the Congressional Record—Senate,1916. The document cited and quoted in the Congressional Record was originallyprinted in The American Diplomatic Code, 1778-1884. The text records a senateconversation about a secret European treaty agreed to in 1822, by Austria,France,Prussia, and Russia. The treaty resulted in the establishment of the MonroeDoctrine.Cooper concludes the chapter by arguing that the Secret Treaty of Veronademonstrates the existence of the so-cal ed Black Nobility. That is, theEuropeanmonarchical dynasties were deposed publicly but continued to actually rulebehindthe scenes. Through to the modern day, hereditary, but secret, kings and princeslordover Europe, using parliaments and elections as a farcical cover to mollify thepublic'ssense of fair play.Senator Robert L. Owen brought to light a silent Declaration of War againstPopularGovernment, secretly schemed by monarchical nations shortly after the successfulAmerican Revolution and America’s second successful victory against the Britishin theWar of 1812. The Secret Treaty of Verona (1822) referred to its contractors asthe “HolyAl iance” (kings of Austria, France, Prussia & Russia), and provides positiveproof ofconspiracy. Senator Owen makes it clear that the threat of this treaty was theexactbasis of the Monroe Doctrine.Behold a Pale Horse Chapter 5: \"Good-by USA, Hello New World Order\"Chapter 5 begins with an introduction of United States Constitutional law. Thesection isconcise and very basic; in essence, it establishes that the United Statesgovernment isdivided into three principle branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. Thethreebranches supposedly form a balance of power which keeps the government in checkand ensures that the citizenry's col ective rights are observed. Cooper thenstates thatsince the Civil War the United States has operated under martial law.The executive branch of the government is charged with enforcing the law but hasusurped the power of the legislative branch by actual y making law on manyoccasions. The most egregious example of executive lawmaking occurs with theNational Security Directives (NSD) issued by the president.According to the U.S. Constitution, there should be a balance of power betweenthethree branches of government. Unfortunately, unconstitutional laws have, andstil arebeing made in the form of Executive Orders, National Security Councilmemos/directives, etc.25In this chapter, you’l read about plans for the suspension of the Constitutionand the role of Mount Weather[http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMount_Weather_Emergency_Operations_Center&t=ZjUxN2Q5ZWVhNjQ4ZWU5ZmVkZTE2Yzc2ZTYyZDFmNDI1ZGJjY2RlOSxwbUtMQUVESw%3D%3D&b=t%3AHOozzQvzM_YsOBjY-klhgQ&m=1]inbringing that about. Should a state of national emergency be cal ed (for anyreason), and the Constitution suspended, a government in waiting(FEMA + Mt. Weather) wil take over control and be used against us.Bill Cooper’s work was prophetic. His information on Executive Orders that canbeissued by the President are so applicable to today’s news regarding Obamasattemptsto push through executive orders regarding gun law. He explains his mostlybelievabletheories clearly and concisely with reference to back up his statements.Althoughwritten in 1991, it is like reading something fresh off the presses today.Was he just too careless in threatening neighbors and law enforcement officersandwaving his gun around, that he sealed his fate in spite of opportunities givento resolvethings peaceful y and did he make too many enemies out of those who wanted tohelphim? Or was al this an elaborate setup as many claim? There are many out therewhobelieve he was kil ed by the US Government for \"knowing too much,\" and maybetheyare right, he just made it easy for them!Behold a Pale Horse Chapter 6:\"H.R. 4079 and FEMA Federal Emergency Management Agency\"The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is a governmental organization,which ostensibly seeks to respond to national emergencies by providing materialandtechnical assistance to local and State governmental organizations. Cooperenumerates several Presidential Executive Orders that relate to FEMA and itspower; hethen alleges that the true purpose of FEMA is to assume the complete control ofthenational government at a moment's notice. FEMA is so constituted that if thePresidentof the United States declares a state of national emergency, FEMA is de facto incontrolof all governmental resources. The short, initial section of the chapter is atranscription of an audio tape that Cooper recorded in 1990.Discover the true purpose of FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (nowunder the Dept. of Homeland Security), and it’s NOT to help people in case of adisaster(Katrina [http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZK6WHYtF-Uc%26feature%3Drelated&t=YTAwOGJmOWY3Y2MzMzk5ZDViNzZkMDE1YzYxM2ZmNjUyNTUzNGVjNyxwbUtMQUVESw%3D%3D&b=t%3AHOozzQvzM_YsOBjY-klhgQ&m=1]anyone?).The U.S. government has long been prepared to declare martial law and putcitizens in camps in the event of a national emergency.

You’l also read an exact report by Dr. Wil iam Pabst concerningFEMA andconcentration camps in the U.S. Pabst sued the U.S. government for establishingthesecamps, but his suit was dismissed.Mr. Cooper was able to see ahead to our time. Let us not forget the powers thatFEMAhas today. They have authority that kicks in as soon as a national emergencydevelops.The Constitution is suspended and they take control. Are you aware of IronMountainand how it can be used? It is an entire city underground!26Behold a Pale Horse Chapter 7:\"Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 H.R. 5210, P.L. 100-690\"Cooper analyzes H.R. 5210 in this brief chapter; he notes the law is \"366 pagesof verysmall print\" (p. 158) and comments that he found much of it unintel igible. Heargues,however, that the law is not aimed at drug control but, instead, seeks toenforce mindcontrol on a grand scale in preparation for the emergence of a police state.Althoughit appears that Cooper's conclusions do not derive logically from the factspresented. Inbrief, he enumerates the law's sectional titles, discusses some types ofequipmentappropriated by the law and comments on the funds discussed. He concludes thatthelaw is treasonous and urges resistance to it.Public Law 100-690 (signed into law in late 1988) is an excel ent example of howcongress passes legislation, which on the surface seems to be reasonable, butunderthe surface it’s real y an attempt to suspend due process, trial by jury, andbring abouta police state! This law is 366 pages of smal print (so the public won’t want toread it),and contains sneaky wording and tons of terrible clauses, which Wil iam Cooperhelpsus to understandBehold a Pale Horse Chapter 8: \"Are the Sheep Ready to Shear?\"This chapter consists of a single page of text which comments on an OklahomaStatelaw that requires extensive, formal registration of belongings fortax-assessmentpurposes. Among those items which must be enumerated are firearms; hence the taxlaw is decried as a form of gun registration. Cooper urges armed and violentoppositionto the law and surmises that it is promulgated as a local 'test case' for asimilar nationalagenda, and he decries Federalism as treason.A short chapter which covers Oklahoma H.B. 1750, a 96-page state law thatrequiresresidents of that state to declare to the tax collector every piece of propertythat theyown! A good way for the government to know what you own - especial y guns! “BigBrother wants to know all and to tax all.” Bil s like this are tests on thepublic for thepolice state.Behold a Pale Horse Chapter 9: \"Anatomy of an Alliance\"Chapter nine's focus returns to the theme of chapters one and two, namely theBilderberg Group. Cooper argues that no one power group could possibly dominatethe entire world because they would be opposed by al other power groups. Thus,onlyan alliance of existing power groups could truly dominate the world andestablish atotalitarian new world order. This alliance did, in fact, form in response toseveral globaldevelopments, principle among which was the 1941-1955 \"baby boom,\" or rapidglobalpopulation growth. This rapid growth threatens the ability of Secret Governmentsto27manage the population; Thus, existing governments are alarmed by populationgrowth and find it threatening.A great chapter to read for those of you who believe it’s just oneethnic/religious groupwho are behind the world’s problems, because it’s NOT. The il uminati is likethe al -starteam of the world, and their shared bond is the need for population control.After WW2,the great worldwide baby boom happened, causing the il uminati to form anallianceknown as the Bilderberg Group.[http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FBilderberg_Group&t=NGNiYzU1M2UxMjg2MGUxMTU4YzdhOWQxYWY2ZmRiZjU4NTc1MjQ5MCxwbUtMQUVESw%3D%3D&b=t%3AHOozzQvzM_YsOBjY-klhgQ&m=1]According to the elite, population is the biggest threat to civilization, sothe Club of Rome[http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FClub_of_Rome&t=ZGU2MDNmNjE2MWQ0MDQxOTI0M2YyM2IyYWZmMDYxY2Q4NzgwNWQ2YixwbUtMQUVESw%3D%3D&b=t%3AHOozzQvzM_YsOBjY-klhgQ&m=1]wasalso created to research the “population problem.” Reports were conducted andtwo points of intervention resulted: lower thebirth rate via birth control, abortion, condoms, etc. and increase the deathrate viawar, disease (AIDS), famine, etc. Bil Cooper offers a much better solution.My friend, don’t ever stop trying to find more about the 'big picture' of Worldcontroland always continue to question those who painted this picture.Behold a Pale Horse Chapter 10: \"Lessons from Lithuania\"Chapter 10 is very brief—only a few pages in length. Cooper states that heoriginallyhad intended to write a lengthy chapter about the fallacy of gun control and theimportance of the Second Amendment. Instead, he feels that the history ofLithuaniapresents a more compelling argument in favor of gun rights and thereforepresents aconcise letter written by one Neal Knox. The rather sketchy account states thatin 1990,Russian troops seized al Lithuanian private arms under a legal pretext. Sincethat dateLithuania has been entirely subjected to Russian political whims and outrages.Cooperconcludes the chapter with the editorial comment that anyone who attempts tosubvert the Second Amendment is a traitor and should be arrested and tried fortreason.Remember, the second amendment of the U.S. Constitution grants the citizens therightto keep and bear arms, especial y for protection against a tyrannicalgovernment.Therefore, the New World Order cannot function if citizens have guns in theirpossession.Behold a Pale Horse Chapter 11: \"Coup de Grace\"Here in this chapter, he provides a telephone conversation between Wil iamCooperand Randall Terpstra; the chapter is presented as if it was a transcription froman audiotape but appears to be a semi-fictive re-creation of the conversation asrememberedby Cooper. The conversation is dated as having occurred after mid-1989. In theconversation, Terpstra responds to Cooper's public al egations that theresignation ofPresident Nixon had actual y been a military coup d’état (Cooper erroneouslyrefers toit as a coup de grace).28Terpstra claims to be an ex-military man who had received communications in themilitary instructing him to disregard any orders issued from the White Houseduring thetumultuous period of the Nixon resignation. As the chapter is Cooper's memory ofTerpstra's memory of a long-past event, it probably is a bit sketchy.Behold a Pale Horse Chapter 12: \"The Secret Government\"This chapter develops the central theories of Cooper's text and attempts tosynthesizethe topics of the preceding chapters. The chapter contains an assortment ofmaterialsincluding previously published papers and delivered speeches; these areinterspersedwith later authorial and editorial comments. Finally, Chapter twelve introducesCooper'salien and UFO-based theories into the narrative structure.“Between 1947 and 1952, sixteen alien spaceships, sixty-five alien bodies, andone livealien were recovered by the Federal government. This unprecedented series ofeventscaused the United States Federal government to engage in the wholesale deceptionofthe populace.”Cooper asserts that aliens created humanity through genetic manipulation; thatalienswrote prophetic sections of the Bible by using time-travel technology, and thatalienshave produced holographic recordings of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.A lot of people believe Wil iam Cooper was a disinformation agent because ofwhat hedisclosed in regards to “alien” UFO’s, moon bases, and other extraterrestrialissues.Cooper claims to have only imparted to the public what he read on Top Secretdocuments while in Naval Intelligence during the 70’s. And did he really saylater thatall such documents on those issues were false information to purposely misleadthereader?PBehold a Pale Horse Chapter 13: \"Treason in High Places\"The brief Chapter thirteen presents Article VI of the United States Constitutionandcontrasts it with the charter and treaty of the United Nations. Cooper concludesthatthe United States has il egal y deprived itself of sovereignty throughacceptance of theUnited Nations' charter. President Truman, by signing the U.N. Participation Actof 1945,deliberately attempted to destroy the sovereignty of the United States ofAmerica.The Constitution continues to be interpreted into meaninglessness. Any informedcitizenshould be able to discern that the United Nations' basic premise is in directconflict tofreedom and, furthermore, legally contradicts the Constitution. Cooper urges allreadersto reject the United Nations and become politically active to ensure that theUnitedStates of America withdraws from the United Nations.29Behold a Pale Horse Chapter 14:\"A Proposed Constitutional Model for the Newstates of America\"Here in chapter fourteen is presented a document titled \"A PROPOSEDCONSITUTIONALMODEL FOR THE NEWSTATES OF AMERICA.\" Without editorial comment, Cooperintroduces the chapter with a rather cryptic notation that the document waspreparedover a ten-year period by the Center for Democratic Studies of Santa Barbara,California, with considerable expenditure of public funds.The document is arranged similarly to the Constitution and includes a preambleandtwelve articles. The document establishes the rights and responsibilities of thecitizenry;proposes the political organization of entities termed Newstates; andestablishes sixportfolios of governance: The Electoral Branch, the Planning Branch, thePresidency, theLegislative Branch, the Regulatory Branch, and the Judicial Branch. Laterarticles dealwith general provisions and governmental arrangements.Behold a Pale Horse Chapter 15: \"Protocols of the Elders of Zion\"Chapter fifteen presents a document titled \"PROTOCOLS OF THE MEETINGS OF THELEARNED ELDERS OF ZION;\" specifical y noted as \"The Britons\" translation of the\"Nilus\"version of the so-called \"Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion.\" Cooper introducesthechapter by noting it is an exact reprint of the original text, which was writtenwith theintention to deceive. He suggests replacing the word \"Zion\" with \"Sion\";references to\"Jews\" with references to \"Il uminati\" and states that the word \"goyim,\" andpresumably including all its derivations, should be replaced with the word\"cattle.\"The document enumerates twenty-four \"protocols,\" perhaps better rendered as\"strategies\" for presumably obtaining Jewish world supremacy. First published inthe early 1900s, the document was intended to discredit Jews in the SovietUnion.Behold a Pale Horse Chapter 16: \"The Story of Jonathan May\"In this chapter he presents a twenty-seven page, autobiographical statementwrittenby one Jonathan May; the statement is apparently intended to be utilized forlegalpurposes and is dated July 1990. Cooper introduces the document by noting thatMayattempted, unsuccessfully, to circumvent the Federal Reserve Bank by organizinganalternative banking system. According to Cooper, May was subsequently hazed andpurposeful y entrapped by the government in order to usurp his idea, the WorldConservation Bank, which wil be an integral component of the New World Order. Itisworth noting that Cooper apparently feels that May's attempt was patriotic;whereas,the putative World Conservation Bank is sinister, even though Cooper claims theyarethe same structure.May's story begins in England and details the discovery of an ancient documentdatingto 1647.30Behold a Pale Horse Chapter 17: \"Documentation: U.S. Army IntelligenceConnection with Satanic Church\"Unlike all other chapters in the text, Chapter seventeen begins without achapter-titlepage. The chapter is comprised of newspaper and magazine clippings and otherdeclassified or public documents—a composition that is unique among the properchapters but is used extensively in the appendices; Cooper presents virtual y noeditorial commentary. The chapter demonstrates that one Michael A. Aquino, anofficer in the United States military, is a publicly-avowed practitioner withinthecongregation of an organized Satanic church known as the Temple of Set. Thechapterincludes some letters of objection that a known Satan-worshipper should beallowed tobe a military officer in good standing. The military response is that Aquino'sperformanceis acceptable and public law forbids the discrimination against religions.Behold a Pale Horse Appendix A: \"William Cooper's Military Service Record\"Appendix A purports to be reproductions of Wil iam Cooper's military servicerecords.The records show military service from 1966 through 1974, noting a unimaginativemilitary career, including service in Viet Nam. Cooper was honorably dischargedafter arank reduction for a prolonged period of nonconformance of requirements and\"laxityin obeying commands and regulations,\" including a consecutive ten days AWOL.Cooper's assignment to 'FAU, CINCPACFLT' ran from January, 1970, throughFebruary,1973. This is the period during which Cooper alleges he held routine access toSecretand Top Secret documents from the Office of Naval Intel igence; the documentswouldlater form the factual basis for Cooper's many allegations of secret governance.Thedocuments presented corroborate many of Cooper's autobiographical statementspresented in the Foreword of the text.Behold a Pale Horse Appendix B: \"UFOs and Area 51\"Appendix B contains various materials which are intended to corroborate theexistenceof UFOs and the secret nature of Area 51. The first segment of the appendix is aletteraddressed to 'dear sirs' from an anonymous author and is dated June 1987.Cooper caused a sensation in UFOlogy circles in 1988 when he claimed to haveseensecret documents while in the Navy describing governmental dealings withextraterrestrial aliens, a topic on which he expanded in Behold a Pale Horse.UFOlogistslater asserted that some of the material that Cooper claimed to have seen inNavalIntelligence documents was actual y plagiarized verbatim from their research,includingseveral items that the UFOlogists had fabricated as pranks. Don Ecker of UFOMagazine ran a series of exposés on Cooper in 1990.31Cooper linked the Il uminati with his beliefs that extraterrestrials weresecretly involved with the United States government, but later retracted theseclaims. Heaccused Dwight D. Eisenhower of negotiating a treaty with extraterrestrials in1954, thenestablishing an inner circle of Il uminati to manage relations with them andkeep theirpresence a secret from the general public. Cooper believed that aliens\"manipulatedand/or ruled the human race through various secret societies, religions, magic,witchcraft, and the occult\", and that even the Il uminati were unknowingly beingmanipulated by them.Cooper described the Il uminati as a secret international organization,controlled bythe Bilderberg Group, that conspired with the Knights of Columbus, Masons, SkulandBones, and other organizations. Its ultimate goal, he said, was theestablishment ofa New World Order. According to Cooper the Il uminati conspirators not onlyinventedalien threats for their own gain, but actively conspired with extraterrestrialsto take overthe world. Cooper believed that James Forrestal's fatal fal from a window on thesixteenth floor of Bethesda Hospital was connected to the alleged secretcommittee Majestic 12, and that JASON advisory group scientists reported to anelitegroup of Trilateral Commission and Council on Foreign Relations executivecommitteemembers who were high-ranking members of the Il uminati.Cooper also claimed that The Protocols of the Elders of Zion was actually an Iluminatiwork, and instructed readers to substitute \"Sion\" for \"Zion\", \"Il uminati\" for\"Jews\", and\"cattle\" for \"Goyim\".In the letter the unknown author states that he worked as a constructionengineer foran unnamed company who provided contracted-construction services to the UnitedStates government. While so employed, the author was sent on five assignments,which,he believes, involved construction at or around crash sites of extra-terrestrialspacecraft.The crash sites include a 1975, crash in 'upstate Pennsylvania;' a 1976, crashsite in'upstate New York;' a 1978, crash site in a lake in 'upstate Pennsylvania;' a1979, crashsite in the ocean.(Refer to the recent Blue Planet Project book: UFO CRASHES REVEALED for moreinfo on these crashes as well as many others:http://www.blue-planet-project.com/UFO-Crashes-Secret-Files-Revealed.html[http://www.blue-planet-project.com/UFO-Crashes-Secret-Files-Revealed.html]Behold a Pale Horse Appendix C: \"Alien Implants\"The brief Appendix C consists of a page of notes and two news articlereproductions;the news articles discuss the then-new technology of implantable RFID chips andthecommentary suggests that the chips are probably a form of brain-control device.Don’t ever fail to take the alien threat seriously in today’s world! They havealreadyestablished contact. The US government has crashed UFOs in their possession.They alsohave the bodies of dead aliens. One crashed UFO even had the body parts ofhumans32which goes to show that they are abducting humans and using them forexperiments.Needless to say diplomatic relations have already been established. We have afew ofthem here as hostages and they have some of ours. Apparently a secret agreementhas been reached. They give us technology and the government al ows them toexperiment on people. The experiments are supposed to be few in number and arenotsupposed to harm the subjects. This has been breached by the aliens but ourtechnology is not sufficient to fight them.Behold a Pale Horse Appendix D: \"AIDS\"The brief Appendix D consists of reproductions of title pages and a smallnewspaperarticle. Cooper's hand-written comments near the tiny newspaper article make itclearthat he considers AIDS to be a governmental y-conceived epidemic.Behold a Pale Horse Appendix E: \"New World Order\"Appendix E consists of a reproduction of a title page and a garbled reporttitled \"Clubof Rome Report - REGIONALIZED AND ADAPTIVE MODEL OF THE GLOBAL WORLD SYSTEM- Report on the Progress in the STRATEGY FOR SURVIVAL PROJECT of the Club ofRome\"(p. 449). The appendix offers a few newspaper clippings and several letters. Theappendix also reproduces pages 62 through 67, of \"The Report from Iron Mountain\"and pages 104 through 107, of \"Carnegie Endowment for International Peace - TheImperialJapanese Mission,\" a document dating from 1917. As may be expected from thefragmentary and eclectic nature of Appendix E, there is no evident theme. Cooperapparently felt the included materials formed some type of compellingdocumentaryevidence for various claims made elsewhere in the text.Behold a Pale Horse Appendix F: \"U.S. Government Drug Involvement\"Appendix F reproduces two lengthy articles authored by Nord Davis, Jr. Thearticles inferthat the United States government is corrupt and involved in the trafficking ofil egaldrugs. President George Bush is specifical y al eged to have gained enormouspersonalwealth through government-sponsored drug deals. The appendix concludes withreproductions of four newspaper articles.Behold a Pale Horse Appendix G: \"Kurzweil vs. Hopkins\"Appendix G offers reproductions of sworn testimonies, court documents, andlettersregarding Dr. Kurzweil, a medical practitioner, and his legal troubles. Thenature ofKurzweil's legal problems is unclear; apparently he became involved with a Mr.Hopkins.33Hopkins was a UFO investigator, who was performing hypnosis on suspectedabductees.Kurzweil became convinced that Hopkins' practices were medically deleterious andfiled a complaint with a government agency. Hopkins responded by filing acomplaintagainst Kurzweil. For whatever reason, Kurzweil's complaint appears to have beendismissed, whereas Hopkins' complaint resulted in a court-ordered mentalevaluation ofKurzweil. The mental evaluation found Kurzweil to be mental y unstable andrequestedthe cancel ation of Kurzweil's medical license. Kurzweil retained legalrepresentationand argued the matter. It is unclear why the materials are included in the text.Behold a Pale Horse Bilderberg GroupPrince Bernhard of the Netherlands organized the Bilderberg Group in 1952, tosubsumeall existing secret societies, thus bringing al the rulers of the world togetherinto onegrand organization. The goal of the joined forces is to establish a New WorldOrder byestablishing a global totalitarian socialist state akin to fascism. The Pope wilbe inultimate control. The fact the President George Bush openly uses the phrase 'NewWorldOrder' establishes beyond a doubt that the process is very advanced and,probably,cannot be stopped.The various disparate secret societies apparently agreed to subordinatethemselves tothe Bilderberg Group after learning of an apparent threat from extra-terrestriallife formsand the impending doom promised by massive over-population.Behold a Pale Horse The Secret GovernmentThe over-arching theme of the text is that a Secret Government exists and is incomplete control of all aspects of global life. The Secret Government isapparentlybased in the United States at Mount Weather, in the vicinity of Washington, D.C.andwas organized c. 1947, with the full knowledge of the legitimate, publicgovernment.Very quickly, however, numerous layers of secrecy and misinformation weredeliberately imposed to buffer the President and the government from the SecretGovernment.These buffers were intended to offer an element of plausible deniability shouldtheexistence of the Secret Government become inadvertently public. Within just afewyears, however, these layers of secrecy had so isolated the Secret Governmentfromthe legitimate government so that most people involved with the government arenotaware that the Secret Government even exists. Today, the President is completelyoblivious to it.Be aware, there are dubious things afoot and shadowy forces in very high places!34Behold a Pale Horse PerspectiveCooper frequently states that he is an expert on topics as far-ranging as alienabduction, extra-terrestrial life forms, secret societies, Presidentialpolitics, and SecretGovernment organizations. His single claim to any privileged knowledge derivesfrom amilitary appointment to a claimed secret facility located in Honolulu, Hawaii.The late Wil iam Cooper was a former United States Naval Intelligence officer,authorand short-wave radio broadcaster from Eagar, Arizona. He was on the FBI’s “watchlist”for such activities as frequently condemning the government for their actions atWacoand Ruby Ridge as wel as his obsession that the government was involved in aconspiracy to establish a “New World Order.”(Guess it didn’t help that President George Bush once mentioned that we wereestablishing a New World Order!)Then he really raised a red flag in 1997 when he referred to the Oklahoma Citybombing as a false flag attack by criminal elements of our government.The White House named Cooper “The most dangerous radio host in America.”When a Deputy Marshall had attempted to serve Cooper with a summons on06/19/1998, Cooper threw him off his property without receiving the summons.Eventual y, a bench warrant for his arrest was issued for not appearing in courton asummons which was never served, leading to an intense surveil ance operation.The intense FBI surveil ance of Cooper’s household included multiple FBImeetings,undercover agents posing as journalists, monitoring of his internet publishing,as wel astestimonies from personal acquaintances and local store owners. Aerial photosweretaken of his ranch.Apache County Sheriff Arthur Lee was concerned that federal agents werepreparingfor a siege on Cooper’s home in order to bring him in. When asked if Lee thoughtCooper represented a threat to the community, the sheriff responded that hebelieved,“Cooper could live in that community for the next 50 years and never receive atrafficticket”. He went on to tell the FBI he does not want a Ruby Ridge Scenario todevelop inhis county.After an anonymous tip came into local law enforcement which claimed Cooperchased two individuals off of nearby property using a firearm, they decided totakeaction and raid Cooper’s home in plain clothes, leading to his controversialdeath.35[index-36_1.png][index-36_2.png][index-36_3.png][index-36_4.png][index-36_5.png][index-36_6.png]A symposium was held in 1957 which was attended by some of the great scientificminds then living. They reached the conclusion that by, or shortly after, theyear 2000the planet WOULD self-destruct due to increased population and man’sexploitation ofthe environment WITHOUT ANY HELP FROM GOD OR THE ALIENS.\"By secret Executive order of President Eisenhower, the JASON Scholars wereordered tostudy this scenario and make recommendations from their findings. The JASONSocietyCONFIRMED the findings of the scientists and made three recommendationscal ed ALTERNATIVES 1, 2, AND 3.\" Alternative 1: Was to use nuclear devices to blast holes in the stratospherefrom which the heat and pol ution could escape into space. They would thenchange the humancultures from that of exploitation into cultures of environmental protection. Ofthe threethis was decided to be the least likely to succeed due to the inherent nature ofmanand the additional damage the nuclear explosions would themselves create. THEEXISTENCE OF A HOLE IN THE OZONE LAYER MAY INDICATE THAT ALTERNATIVE 1 MIGHTHAVE BEEN ATTEMPTED. THIS IS, HOWEVER, ONLY CONJECTURE.\" ALTERNATIVE 2: WAS TO BUILD A VAST NETWORK OF UNDERGROUND CITIES ANDTUNNELS IN WHICH A SELECT REPRESENTATION OF ALL CULTURES AND OCCUPATIONSWOULD SURVIVE AND CARRY ON THE HUMAN RACE. THE REST OF HUMANITY WOULD BELEFT TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES ON THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET.In 1959 the Rand Corporation hosted a Deep Underground Construction Symposium.Inthe symposium report, machines are pictured and described which could bore atunnel45 feet in diameter at the rate of 5 feet per hour in 1959. It also displayspictures of hugetunnels and underground vaults containing what appear to be complex facilitiesandpossibly even cities. It appears that the previous five years of all-outundergroundconstruction had made significant progress by that time.We know that these facilities have been built and are ready and waiting for thechosenfew to be notified.\" Alternative 3: Was to exploit the alien and conventional technology in orderfor a select few to leave the earth and establish colonies in outer space. I amnot able toeither confirm or deny the existence of ’batch consignments’ of human slaves,whichwould be used for the manual labor as a part of the plan. The Moon, code-named ADAM, was the object of primary interest, followed by the planet Mars,code-named EVE. I am now in possession of official NASA photographs of one of themoonbases. I believe that the Mars colony is also a reality36(Note: There are some who suggest that \"global warming\" may not actual y betaking place as believed, and that this \"scare\" is based largely on computerizedmodels orsimulations which have not always coincided with actual temperature variations.Is itpossible that the earth is attempting to \"heal\" itself? Could it be that to someextent\"global warming\" is more-or-less an \"excuse\" that is being used to justify hugeexpenditures for subterranean and exterranean \"bases\" for secret government usesuch as in the \"Alternative\" scenarios? This is of course, even if true, noreason to destroy this planet, as pol ution of the air, water and earth ISsomething which could lead to aneventual devastation of this Earth.\"As a delaying action, ALL THREE ALTERNATIVES included BIRTH CONTROL,STERILIZATION,AND THE INTRODUCTION OF DEADLY MICROBES TO CONTROL OR SLOW THE GROWTH OFEARTH’S POPULATION. AIDS is only ONE result of these plans. It was decided BYTHE ELITEthat since the population must be reduced and control ed, it would be in thebestinterest of the human race to rid ourselves of undesirable elements of oursociety.Specific targeted populations included BLACKS, HISPANICS, and HOMOSEXUALS.\"(Note: It appears that when they made this decision the elite were on the vergeofpossessing the technology to solve the overpopulation, food and energy problems-even to the point of being able to transport excess populations to otherplanetarybodies if necessary.Apparently they opted for mass genocide which they believed would keep thepopulation to a manageable minimum, not wishing to give up the political andeconomic control which they possessed and which would to a large degree be lostifthey openly gave this super- technology freely to the masses. Pro-abortionactivist-leader and ’Planned Parenthood’ founder Margaret Sanger betrays her own devotionto the Globalist genocidal policies and insensitivity to women’s rights,especially non-Aryan women’s rights--not to mention the constitutional rights to ’life, libertyand thepursuit of happiness’ on the part of multi-mil ions of children--in thefollowing words fromher first book ’PIVOT OF CIVILIZATION’.In reference to free maternity care for the poor she states: \"Instead ofdecreasing andaiming to eliminate the stocks that are most detrimental to the future of therace andthe world it tends to render them to a menacing degree dominant.\"And in reference to her ’Negro Project’ of the late 1930’s, which aimed atrecruitingblack ministers, physicians and political leaders for birth control andsterilization in theblack community, Sanger wrote: \"We do not want word to go out that we want toexterminate the Negro population, and the minister is the man who can straightenoutthat idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebel ious members.\"Cooper continues:\"The joint U.S. and Soviet leadership dismissed Alternative 1 BUT ORDERED WORKTOBEGIN ON ALTERNATIVES 2 AND 3 VIRTUALLY AT THE SAME TIME.\"37[index-38_1.png][index-38_2.png][index-38_3.png][index-38_4.png][index-38_5.png][index-38_6.png]Bill Cooper - I've read your recent interview (in the MUFON Journal) where yousay youdon't believe in MJ-12, so it made me wonder why you wanted this meeting.Jacques Vallee - THE INTERVIEW WAS DONE BEFORE I MET JOHN LEAR, BUT I WILL GRANTYOU THAT MY POSITION HASN'T CHANGED THAT MUCH. I BELIEVE THERE IS A UFOPHENOMENON WHICH IS PHYSICAL IN THE USUAL SENSE, BUT IT CAN MANIPULATE SPACEAND TIME IN WAYS I CERTAINLY DON'T UNDERSTAND; PERHAPS THERE ARE PEOPLEAROUND WHO UNDERSTAND IT.They do, but go on...I FURTHER BELIEVE, AS DO YOU, THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MUST HAVE BEEN STUDYINGIT FOR YEARS. THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT MJ-12 IS REAL. THERE IS A HALL OF MIRRORSONE ENTERS AS SOON AS THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY IS INVOLVED, AND WE'RE RIGHTIN THE MIDDLE OF IT. THEN I TALKED TO LINDA HOWE AND FRED BECKMAN, BOTH OFWHOM RECOMMENDED THAT I LISTEN TO JOHN LEAR, WHO IS AN IMPRESSIVE FELLOW,AND HE SAID I SHOULD TALK TO YOU, AND HERE I AM.I became involved in the UFO question as a Naval Intel igence Man. In the periodof1971-72 I was ordered to brief several high-level officers about the contents ofcertaindocuments that were given to me. Those briefings had to do with the fact that anumber of UFOs have been captured by the military and that their occupants havebeen working along with our scientists. We have entered into a treaty with them.YOU ARE GOING A LITTLE TOO FAST FOR ME. FIRST OF ALL, WHAT WAS YOUR POSITION INTHE NAVY?I was under Admiral Clarey, as a member of the Intel igence briefing team.WERE THE DOCUMENTS CLASSIFIED, AND AT WHAT LEVEL?They were classified Top Secret/S.I.WAS THERE A CODE WORD ATTACHED TO THEM?MAJIC, with a \"J\", was the code word. I am sure they changed it now.HOW LONG WAS THE BRIEFING, AND WHERE WAS IT GIVEN?There were several briefings, all of which took place at the Headquarters forPacificOperations on the island of Hawaii. The building overlooks Pearl Harbor. Thefirst briefingwas a two-and-a-half-hour general overview, then there were periodic updates asnewinformation came to light.38WHY WERE THESE OFFICERS BEING BRIEFED?Because in their operational capacity, they had an immediate need to know. One,they might be required to recover some crashed disks in the future. Two, theUFOs mightbe misconstrued as offensive Soviet devices and fired upon, so they had to beaware oftheir existence.WERE THERE INSTANCES WHEN THE UFOS POSED A REAL THREAT?During the Vietnam War a UFO shot down a B-52. There were also cases when ourtroops were attacked by things they first thought were helicopters. There wassomespeculation at the time that the Russians must have entered the war on the NorthVietnamese side, so it became a pretty serious matter.DID THE NAVY EVER PICK UP A DISK AFTER THAT?There was an incident in which I was an actual witness, involving the recoveryof a craftthat was later listed as a Soviet sub. I was in the command center when ithappened,and I can assure you it was real.HAVE YOU YOURSELF EVER SEEN AN ALIEN?No.HAVE YOU EVEN SEEN PART OF A CRASHED DISK?No, but I know two different men who were assigned to guard crashed disks andwhohave spoken to me.HAVE YOU EVER SEEN UFOS YOURSELF?Once, in the late summer of 1966, I was on watch on board a submarine, the USSTiru,SS-416, on the way to Seattle, and three of us saw a disk as large as anaircraft carrierrising out of the sea two and a half miles away on the port side. It rose andwas lost inthe clouds, then it came back down again.DID IT DISTURB THE OCEAN?Not real y, the water would glide around it, as if it was drawn by a forcefield.WERE THERE BRIEFINGS GIVEN TO HIGH-ECHELON OFFICERS BEFORE 1971?There must have been, given the information in the documents. The text statedthat thefirst secret project was established at Eisenhower's orders in 1953. Ike askedRockefellerto help him in setting up an organization that could conduct a study withoutgovernment agencies or Congress being aware of the situation. Rockefellerestablishedit under the \"Jasons\", an elite intel ectual group. The task force was composedof twelve men, including Kissinger, Dulles, Brzezinski, George Bush, and eightothers, who becameknown as the the MJ-12 under operation Majority.39WHERE DID THEY MEET?At a place cal ed the Country Club. This way they could mention it openlywithoutanyone knowing what they were talking about. It was a piece of land in Marylandwhich Rockefel er had set aside for the Jasons. It was only accessible throughthe air.AND THE INFORMATION THAT WAS KEPT SECRET HAD TO DO WITH UFOS SPECIFICALLY?With UFOs and with the Aliens. There are four types of aliens. There are twokinds of\"Grays\", including one race, not commonly seen, that has a large nose. Thenthere are the \"Nordic\" types, tall blonde Aryans, and finally the \"Orange\" ones.WHERE DO THEY COME FROM?I remember seeing several points of origin mentioned: Orion,the Pleiades, Betelgeuse, Barnard's star and Zeta Reticuli.YOU MENTIONED WE HAD A TREATY WITH THEM?Since 1964.WHY WOULD THEY GO TO THE TROUBLE OF ENTERING INTO A TREATY WITH US, SINCE THEIRTECHNOLOGY IS FAR AHEAD OF OURS? JOHN LEAR MENTIONED A BILLION YEARS.They needed the government to keep their presence secret. Remember, we had oneof the Aliens in our custody. Our radar affected their navigation system andthrew theircraft off-balance.HOW ARE THEIR SHIPS POWERED?With a small nuclear reactor, the size of a footbal . They use a space-timefold. I'm not aphysicist, so I don't understand that. Apparently they have the ability to cloakthemselves, to go invisible.WHAT KIND OF METAL DO THEY USE?In the early days it was pure magnesium. We couldn't duplicate it at the time,but nowwe could duplicate it in space, that's why there is so much interest in growingcrystals inorbit. They use alloys that we can create on Earth but not with the same pliablestructure. Do you know any of the astronauts? Ask any of the Apollo astronautsaboutthe moon. What they saw there. There is an Alien base on the dark side of themoon.WHAT HAPPENED TO THE ALIEN THAT WAS CAPTURED?He died in 1952 after being il for one year. The government tried to save him.Theybroadcast messages into space, asking that his people come and help. The resultofthat was the Holloman landing, on April 25, 1964, when another Alien came toworkwith our scientists. He gave us lots of information. The Aliens were desperateto havetheir presence on Earth kept secret. We agreed to that, in exchange for theirtechnology. The Aliens were given permission to conduct abductions. They saidthey40needed to do them on medical grounds. They were supposed to give MJ-12 the listof the humans they abducted. Then we began to realize they lied to us.WHERE ARE THE ALIENS NOW?At Area-51. Everybody thinks it is under control of the Air Force, because it'sat Nellis AirForce Base in Nevada. But in reality Area-51 is under the Navy. The Navy hasoperational control of field activities on this project. That also includesArea-2, whichwas originally built as an underground storage area for the Atomic EnergyCommission.WHAT ABOUT GROOM LAKE?Groom Lake is at Nel is, same thing. There is an Alien Technical Group atNellis, andthere is another one near Dulce, New Mexico, on an Indian reservation.HOW DO WE KNOW THAT'S TRUE?That's what the documents stated. It turns out there is a large magnetic anomalywherethe base is. Perhaps ground-penetrating radar would show what's inside,allegedly it isall honeycombed with tunnels. The document explains how to get in, where thedoorsare.IS IT GUARDED?No, it's not guarded. That would only attract attention, they would have toexplain whatit is. But once you go in, you never come out. I can take you there if you want.WHAT WERE THE TWO DOCUMENTS THAT YOU USED FOR THE BRIEFINGS? CAN YOUDESCRIBE THEM?The thickest one was a book, about three-quarters of an inch thick, cal ed\"Grudge/Blue Book Report Number 13\". People think Blue Book was under the AirForce, but it wasn't. Blue Book was under Grudge, which in turn was assigned tothe Air Forceto run. It had to do with abductees and implants.WHAT WAS THE OTHER DOCUMENT?It was an outline on Operation Majority, which also covered Blue Book.HAS ANYONE ELSE SEEN THESE DOCUMENTS?There is a man named Bill English who is in hiding near Albuquerque, and who hasseenthe same things I did. He is afraid for his life. They have already tried to kilhim twice. The government blew up a van in which he was riding with two otherfel ows. They died,and he's lucky to have escaped. The only reason nothing happens to me is that Italk topeople, I disseminate all the information I have.You must realize that for a long time I kept it all inside, because I thought itwas in theinterest of the country, and I had a high sense of duty. I don't have that senseanymore.It's al wrong. Too many people have been kil ed because of this. It's completelyil egal,and we have been betrayed by the Aliens. We live under immense danger now.41HOW DID THIS OTHER MAN, BILL ENGLISH, GET TO SEE THE DOCUMENTS?He was a captain in the U.S. Army, Special Forces. He was assigned as aninformationanalyst at a British base. The document came in the regular pouch. He was notsupposed to see it, it was an error in routing. So he was kicked out. Attemptswere madeon his life. He was ridiculed. Some people even said he was on LSD!WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE 'COVER-UP\" DOCUMENTARY, RELEASED BY SELIGMAN?It was part of the damned contingency plan, a deliberate attempt by thegovernmentto confuse people. Perhaps I shouldn't say this, but some of the participantsareinformers for the government.WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF THE DOCUMENTARY, THEN?To lead people away from the truth. Al the Majestic-12 documents that Moore haspresented were obvious fakes. It was done to discredit the people associatedwith thatresearch. The whole thing read like a chapter in his book about the Roswellcrash, therewas nothing new in it. The pictures of Aliens were not right. And Majestic-12was notformed by Truman, as they implied.DO YOU THINK IT IS EASY TO FOOL PEOPLE?The truth is so incredible... Look at this magnificent ship. (They were aboardthe QueenMary) Imagine the Queen Mary sailing past an island where the population wasstilliving in the Stone Age. What would they say about it? That's our situation withrespectto alien craft.PRECISELY. THE QUEEN MARY DOESN'T BOTHER TO ENTER INTO A TREATY WITH THE KINGOF EVERY LITTLE ISLAND. AGAIN, BILL, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE ALIENS WOULDNEED A FORMAL TREATY WITH US, IF THEY ARE SO ADVANCED. IT SEEMS TO ME THEYWOULD JUST IGNORE US COMPLETELY.They need to make sure the government would keep their existence from thepublic.I HAVE HEARD FROM JOHN, AND ALSO FROM LINDA HOWE, THAT THE NAME OF ALLENHYNEK WAS MENTIONED IN REPORT-13?Mentioned? He was the co-author of the damned thing! Hynek was completelyinvolved in it, in the study of the abductions and the implants. He even madethestatement that one person in forty has been abducted and has received animplant.Of course, many more people have simply been abducted. The scary part is, whatifthe people who are in the government have all been implanted already?ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT I KNEW HYNEK VERY WELL, AND THAT WHAT YOU SAY ABOUTHIM MAKES NO SENSE TO SOMEONE WHO KNEW THE MAN'S CHARACTER.And all I can tel you is what was in that document. Hynek's name was on thecover,and inside there were pictures of the Hol oman landing, photos of Aliens,autopsy42tables, and details of Project Red-light, where we actual y try to fly theircraft, and Project Snowbird, a cover for Red-light using conventionaltechnology, and so on.By the way, their craft don't crash when they are disabled, they settle in theimpactcrater where the dirt has been pushed aside.(According to the documentation briefly revealed to Moore, Project Snowbird wasestablished in 1972 to research and test-fly a recovered alien spacecraft. Todate,attempts to resolve this claim via the Freedom of Information Act have beenunsuccessful. The existence of another Project Snowbird, however, has beenverified.This was a joint U.S. Army-U.S. Air Force military exercise established in 1955to traintroops to fight in the sub-Arctic region.)THERE IS A CONTRADICTION HERE. BLUE BOOK, FROM WHAT I SAW, WAS MOSTLY APUBLIC RELATIONS PROJECT. THERE WAS NO FOLLOW-UP ON CASES, INFACT. HYNEK KEPT COMPLAINING ABOUT THAT.There was no follow-up because they already knew what those things were. Buttheystil had to explain then to the public. One of the documents said specificallythat hecases they can't explain should be referred to Philip Klass, who works incahoots with theintel igence community. You know, things are never what they seem to be anymore.WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE PURPOSE OF THE IMPLANTS?Nobody knows. When an attempt is made to remove them, the person dies.WAIT A MINUTE. IF THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE 1953, MANY OF THE IMPLANTEDPEOPLE MUST ALREADY HAVE DIED OF PERFECTLY NATURAL CAUSES. IT WOULD BE ASIMPLE MATTER TO REMOVE THE IMPLANT DURING THE AUTOPSY AND STUDY IT. DON'TYOU THINK A PATHOLOGIST WOULD NOTICE IT AND BE INTRIGUED ENOUGH TO TAKE ITAPART?(No Answer)BILL, IF WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME CAN BE PROVEN, WE WILL HAVE TO RECONSIDEREVERYTHING WE KNOW ABOUT THIS PROBLEM. I HAVE NO QUESTION THAT YOU ARETELLING ME WHAT YOU BELIEVE, AND IF YOU SAY YOU HAVE SEEN THIS REPORT-13, I AMWILLING TO TRUST YOU. BUT THE FACT THAT HYNEK'S NAME WAS ASSOCIATED WITH ITMAKES ME THINK THAT IT WAS A COMPLETE FABRICATION.I have seen the report myself and Hynek's name is on it.SO WHAT DO YOU THINK SHOULD BE DONE NOW?The information should be disseminated to the public, as widely as possible.43DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT KNOWS?Yes, Bush must know, as a former member of MJ-12. Previous presidents were onlytoldwhat THEY wanted them to know. The President would have to blurt it out in themiddleof a press conference, before they were aware that he was going to say anything.Don't you see? If the information was released, the intelligence community wouldcollapse. Nobody would ever trust those people again. As you know, Reaganclassifiedeverything about UFOs. Nobody who does any work with the government can talkabout the subject, even if they do unclassified work.YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY MEAN THAT! FOR ONE THING, IT WOULD VIOLATE THE FIRSTAMENDMENT. FOR ANOTHER, NO ONE WOULD OBEY SUCH AN ORDER. THEGOVERNMENT HASN'T EVEN DEFINED WHAT A UFO IS! IT WOULD BE LIKE YOUR ASKING METO KEEP SECRET WHAT WE HAD FOR DINNER TONIGHT, OR WHAT WE SAID TO EACHOTHER. YOU COULD NEVER FORCE ME TO DO IT. I HAVEN'T AGREED TO IT IN ADVANCE.FURTHERMORE, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT WE HAD FOR DINNER TONIGHT, SOI COULDN'T KEEP IT A SECRET EVEN IF I WANTED TO!Reagan ordered that no one doing any kind of business with the U.S. governmentmustdiscuss UFOs.LET'S TALK MORE ABOUT THE ALIENS. WHY ARE THEY COMING HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE?There is a document about Project Aquarius that deals with the history of theAliens andtheir interaction with Homo sapiens for the last twenty-five thousand years.Thisinteraction culminated with the Basque culture and the Assyrians. But ProjectAquarius was closed. Their planet has turned into a desert fol owing a war theyhad withanother race. They have been devastated, they are in evolutionary decline, theirdigestive system is atrophied. They come here in search of new genetic material.THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE!The government believes it!HOW LONG DO THE ALIENS LIVE?They told us they lived four hundred and fifty years. The live Alien who wasleft on Earthafter Hol oman was named Kril . He gave lots of information, scientific data,some ofwhich was published in the open scientific literature under the name O. H. Kril, afterbeing sanitized. Very advanced stuff. Kril is stil alive. Their biology iswell-understood.They are air-breathing creatures like us, although the heart is connected totheir lungsas a single organ. Their digestive system is atrophied. They are chlorophyl-based, plant-like, if you wil . They absorb nourishment through the skin, and they excretethrough theskin too.44[index-45_1.png][index-45_2.png][index-45_3.png][index-45_4.png][index-45_5.png][index-45_6.png]WHAT ABOUT THEIR BRAINS?They have two brains, separated by a bone partition, but going into the samespinalcord.DO YOU KNOW ANY DOCTOR WHO MIGHT HAVE ATTENDED THE ALIENS OR DONE ANAUTOPSY?Look up the name Dr. Guil ermo Mendoza. He nursed the one Alien who died. He wasabiologist, not an M.D. By the way, they did feed the Alien ice cream, which hecouldeat in small quantities through a membrane in his mouth, and he did likestrawberry.And he was partial to Tibetan music. That part of the Seligman \"Cover-Up\"documentary was true.HOW DO THEY COMMUNICATE?Among themselves, they communicate telepathically. They use a translation devicewith us. When they first came, they contacted our scientists in binary code. Youknow,I'm not a religious man. But if you look at the Bible, the Angels could be theNordic typesand the Grays could well be the demonic ones. After all, the Bible talks about apactwith the Devil in the last days, after Israel is reinstated. Leading toArmageddon.WHAT DID THE ALIENS HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT?The information they gave us wasn't just scientific data. They provided much ontheoccult side. They claimed that had a lot to do with our religion. They spokeabout witchcraft and cults on Earth.SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT ALL THAT?I am going to get the information out. I have resigned from my job. To beginwith, I'morganizing a symposium at Anaheim. The profits wil be used to build up a rewardfundfor those who want to come up and reveal what they know. Then I'll take thesymposium to all the major cities.There are many hazards involved with exposing information regarding UFOs. It hasnotbeen until quite recently that any degree of safety at all has been availablefor peoplereleasing such information. Were it not for the fact that Cooper released hisinformationso far and Wide and it filtered to so many people at once—newspapers,legislators,heads of state, people in important positions all over the world—he would havesuffered severely. But because it was scattered so quickly, it would have beenfruitless45to silence him after the information had been released. It would only have addedto the credibility of the information.At the beginning of 1990, there was stil an active debate in certain circlesabout whatto do about Cooper—whether to deal with him in a threatening manner or to simplydiscredit him. A campaign planned to use approximately one mil ion dol ars’worth ofeffort to discredit him. The money was to be used to imply that Cooper made uporgathered information from various sources and threw it together for a personalfinancialmotive. It was not to come through normal media channels, but through UFOmagazines and newsletters in the form of articles and exposes and through UFOgroups, most of which are control ed. Alternate UFO scenarios were also to bereleasedso that by the time 1990 ended, many different scenarios would be floatingaround.People would be unable to decipher which one was true and which one wasn’t.As long as interest was shown in the Cooper material by only a smal group ofpeoplewho happened to be curious about UFOs, there was to be no action taken. Butif Cooper’s material was taken seriously by credible people, these would be thetargetfor the efforts to discredit him.Enormous amounts of previously highly classified information have been broughtoutinto the open. We now have a situation where, individuals, instead of beingforced toremain silent for fear of assassination are not afraid to tell what they know.Too manyhave seen. Too many have witnessed. They cannot al be silenced. This is thebeginningof the end of the security surrounding this situation. Therefore, the followinginformationshal be released.THE SPECIES CLASSIFIEDThe present number of alien types having contact with the earth right now isnine, withseven being relatively permanent and five being influential. Contrary to theinformationthat the government might release, not all UFO inhabitants are friendlyrepresentativesfrom the Galactic Space Confederation.1.- ZETA RETICULI GREYS—SMALLZeta Reticuli Greys come from Zeta Reticulan, near Barnard’s Star, which is aneighboring star system to Orion. They are very short (about 3 ½ to 4 feettall), grayishsilver in color and have no sexual or digestive parts to their bodies. They arecreatedthrough a cloning process of alien genetic engineering. They are an ancient raceandhave reproduced themselves for thousands of years. They have very limited facialfeatures. They have large eyes, a very smal slit for a mouth and no nose tospeak of.The eyes are large almond-shaped and black.46They have evolved beyond the sexual reproduction process so that all sexualorgansand their digestive tracts have totally atrophied. They are no longer capable ofeatingor indulging in sexual activities. They are a close relative to the insectfamily.The Zetas are the ones involved in the cattle mutilations. They absorb certainsubstances from parts of the cattle that stabilize them during the cloningprocess. Thiscan be placed under the tongue to give sustenance and stability for some time.It is asubstance that comes from certain mucus membranes: the lips, nose, genitals andrectum, and also from certain organs. These glandular substances serve asnutrients inlieu of eating.Resting the substances under the tongue is not the only way they get nutrition.You mayhave noticed that the cattle mutilations generally result in al the blood beingdrainedfrom the body. The Zetas have in their bases canisters and vats in which animalandhuman organs float along with a purple liquid to hold these parts in suspension.TheZetas swim in the mixture and absorb the nutrients through their skin. They usehydrogenperoxide in both the absorption and elimination process. The hydrogen peroxidealsohelps to preserve the liquid and organ mixture to keep it from spoiling.They have no digestive tract and eliminate through the skin. To eliminate, theyneed topass the substance through some part of their body, much the same way plantseliminate through their skin or outer shel s. They use hydrogen peroxide forhelping withthat elimination as well.The Zetas have also been referred to as the Little Green Men because they tendto turna shade of green when they have not received sufficient food. When they are inthisstate, they are very vicious. The cloning of these aliens can be done quitequickly,reproducing synthetic replicas. They have a technology that is much beyond thatofhumans and that has led to the agreements with the United States overnmentwherebyexchanges of these techniques could occur.The Zeta Reticuli Greys are not masters of their own fate. They are, rather,subservient toa reptilian race of people from their home planet. The Zetas seek, but arefearful of,freedom from their masters. They seem to have some desire to work closely withhumans in an effort to retain the freedom they have on earth, which they haveneverexperienced before. In their desire to retain that freedom from their reptilianmasters,they would hope to play the role of being masters here on earth, or at leasthavingenough control so as to be safe from slavery by any other species.The Zetas are of two social classes: one being hawkish, the other moredove-like.The more dove-like Zetas are more refined and capable of more business-likebehaviortoward humans, while the other type is more abrupt, blunt and crude in theirdirectness. The Zetas desire the help of humans in an expected futureconfrontationwith the reptilian masters who are expected to follow soon, within the next 20years. This47refers to the so-called asteroid that is on its way toward earth. It is housingapproximately 30 mil ion reptilian aliens. It has, however, temporarily divertedits path asit moves into the constellation of Draco.2.- BELLATRAX GREYS—SHORTThe short Grey, which is shorter than the Zeta Reticuli, is from a star systemnearthe Orion constellation, near the shoulder of the figure in a star systemcal ed Bel etrax. They are shorter, much like dwarves (about 1 ½ feet tall).They are moreindirect, but just as vicious towards humans as the Zetas.Both the Bel atrax Grays and the Zeta Reticuli Greys are related genetical yfrom thesame root race and look very much alike except for size.3.- ORION GRAYS—TALLThe other type of Grey is the tal , big-nosed Grey. They have large noses andstandabout 7 or 8 feet tal . They are based in the Aleutian Islands and recently werewitnessed in a park in the Eastern part of Russia. These creatures are hostile,but lessvicious toward humans. They tend to try to influence through the use ofpoliticalcontrols. They have certain powers and technologies that allow them to performactions that appear miraculous.In the Russian incident, a woman whose leg was deformed was picked up bythese Orion Greys and was released thousands of miles away. Her leg was healed.Thealiens did not heal her leg. They transplanted a new leg onto her body. TheOrion Graysgive the impression that they are benevolent towards humans, but they areheavily intogenetic engineering. They use humans as guinea pigs to conduct variousexperiments.They have grown arms and legs and other body parts in a formless matrix madefromhuman flesh.A leg may grow out of a torso, hands might grow from the middle of the torso’sstomach. Al this is done through the injecting of certain genomes into flesh andtheapplication of electromagnetic charges. In this way they can grow human bodypartsto help deformed or injured humans—or for their own purposes of food andsustenance.They are interested in control ing the masses of the earth through certainnegotiatedagreements with those in power.4.- ALL GREYSThe Greys are al , to some degree, influencing human history at this time. Thenature ofthe Greys, especial y the Zeta Reticuli and the short Greys, is that they do nothavedeep emotional feelings or compassion. They are very calculating, cold intelectualsand see humans as being inferior. They look at humans much the same way a farmerlooks at his cows. They understand the passions and compassion of humans to the48degree it is observable by them. But they do not have feelings.These aliens are on the equivalent human level of cannibals. They see humansbeing aninferior species. They are carnivorous. The Zeta Reticuli Greys feed uponglandularsecretions of humans and are quite capable of kil ing people for that secretion,orabducting humans and extracting the secretions for themselves.The genetic manipulation is one way that the aliens see as evolving and savingtheirdying race. In a sense, humans are suddenly the saviors of the souls of thealiens. But atleast it is a way that humans may have an influence on the aliens. This is notthe firsttime that a civilization has attempted to absorb an enemy rather than defeatingit.While the enemy invader may assume that they are taking over, they are in factbeingabsorbed. The Tartars invaded Russia and within a hundred years were absorbedintoRussian society.5.- PLEIADEANSOf the five, those from the Pleiades are entities who are distant relatives ofhumankind.They are related to and are the forefather race of the genetic creation ofhumankind.They are of a higher spiritual development than most people on earth at thistime. Theyhave a kinship towards humans, and are essential y the only aliens who can to betrusted by humans. They have blonde hair and fair skin. They are allied with theIntergalactic Space Confederation.That doesn’t mean that all entities of human appearance in space craft can orshouldbe trusted, for there are humans from this planet from various governments whoareworking for the Zeta Reticuli Grays. Some from the Pleiades are subordinates totheGrays, having been abducted as children or offspring of the abductees. They havebeen raised and trained by the Grays as servants. The humans from the Pleiadeshavemade several earth contacts, but in recent times have suspended visitations toearth.The government was told that this was because of a space law that states thatthedestiny of a people shall not be interfered with unless it threatens themselvesor others inthe galaxy. If the threat of nuclear war became strong enough, these entitiesindicatedthat they might interfere, but only to the degree of reducing that threat. Thatcould alsoset up a conflict between the Pleiadeans and the Zeta Grays, to whom a limitednuclear war is seen as beneficial.Since the humans have made an agreement and pact with the Zeta Greys, eventhough there were warnings by the Pleiadeans against this, there is now a “handsoff”policy. The Pleiadeans feel that the humans have made their bed and now theymustlie in it. It is not likely that humans wil be rescued from planned eventssimply to makethings easier for humans to overcome the masters they have agreed to work with.496.- DRACO MOTHMENIn the constellation of Draco, there is another race of entities which has inthe pastvisited Earth. They are 8-foot-tall, dark, nocturnal aliens who appeared aroundgraveyards and parks. They have red eyes that glow in the dark and wings to fly.Theyare referred to by us as Mothmen. They are also the source of legends of thepastrelating to gargoyles and Valkeries. Even some qualities of vampires have beentakenfrom the qualities of this creature—the ability to fly and nocturnal habits.The Mothmen have no particular influence on earth at this time other than ascausingpanic and a cause for curiosity. They are mostly hidden underground and do notwishto attract attention.7.- DEROS/TEROSThere are also underground civilizations of non-humans that have been referredtoas Deros and Teros. The Teros are more friendly and help keep the Deros, who aremoredemented, from having excessive power. They live underground in tunnels, citiesandsometimes under the sea. Most of the legends of the past of leprechauns and trols referto these non-humans from the inner earth. The Deros are competitors with theGreys, but they have similar qualities and cannot be trusted.THE GOVERNMENT CONNECTIONCrisis management is a term used by the government to describe the scenariowhere acrisis situation is created and then the people are presented with solutions,usual y three,which they would be reluctant to accept prior to the crisis. The solutionsalways involvethe shoring up of security, which necessarily means the loss of some freedoms.Whenthe situation has reached the crisis stage, it appears as if there is no otheralternative. It appears as if the crisis just happened rather than being carefuly planned.Crisis management is a way to create the il ness for which the pill has alreadybeeninvented. By creating a problem in order to supply a cure that would not havebeenacceptable without the problem, the government is able to manipulate the people,making it look as though it is benevolent in handing the situation on behalf ofthepeople, when in fact, it is directing the movement of the people along aspecific paththat has already been chosen.The current drug crisis is a case in point, although there is a connection toalien basefunding that makes it a very special scenario. A tremendous amount ofinformationhas linked the United States government with the drug trade since at least the1960s.The Christic Institute filed suit, but was successfully neutralized. Thegovernmentinformation that is being released is a subtle form of convincing the public,that themilitary must be used to do what is real y the job of the local police, for themilitary to50shoot down airplanes suspected of carrying drugs, for the military to be used inforeign countriesThe coming currency cal -in is related to drug money laundering. There is acontinuingcal for the banning of all firearms because of their use in criminal activity,particularlydrug-related crimes. The ban on assault weapons wil soon be extended to everygun. Adeclaration of martial law, with the resulting major security upgrade to dealwith thealien crisis, wil be much easier when these things occur.The drug situation started out as a social experiment back in the 1800s. Therewas aquestion of whether people could be control ed by the use of drugs and to whatextent. There was at one time a belief that by getting the population hooked ondrugs,they would work at a cheap wage, with only the reward of food, shelter and drugstokeep them satisfied. The experiment, however, resulted in the realization thatthose ondrugs are not satisfied with working. They want to steal from others and are wiling tobecome violent to do so.The experiment also revealed that while crime increases in the United Stateswouldjustify creating a national police force, the economic structure at that timewas notsound enough to pay for such a police state. The entire concept became lessappealing and more hazardous to the government.The experiment ran its course, and yielded little in terms of the controllingeffects thatwere desired. The side benefit, however, was billions of dol ars in profits fromthe sellingof drugs. The drug situation has assisted the funding of the aliens in buildingtheirunderground civilization. Much of this money has gone into helping them in theireffortsto establish bases underground. In exchange, the United States got technology apromise that the alienswould not go to war with the United States or othercountries ofthe world.The aliens gave the United States and the Soviet Union:1. particle beam weapons2. laser technology3. Stealth technology4. some supercomputer technology5. information on cloning and synthetic genetic duplication of humans6. some medical breakthroughs7. technology associated with frequencies, vibrations and the electromagneticspectrum such as ELF waves and rail gun technology51There has recently been a breakthrough in the need for blood by these aliens, inthat cattle blood has been altered so that it suits their needs. It is aside-effect from theexperimentation that involved the cattle mutilations. Much of the blood andtissues thatthey need could be supplied from slaughterhouses and there would be no moremutilations.There has been a continuing massive effort to fund the aliens through variousmeans—not only drugs, but manipulated oil prices and other methods—to keep thempacifiedlong enough to determine how best to deal with them. The choice was to co-existwiththem while secretly expanding the country’s technologies in order to deal withthem inthe event of a conflict. This has given greater time for the technology ofhumans toclose the gap with the technology of the aliens.It has been assessed that in recent years that the aliens have not been honoringthetreaties and agreements and therefore, are not to be trusted. The effort to cutoff theirfunding has begun, and one of the routes for cutting off funding is to shut downthedrug traffic and the influx of money from the drug cartel. Noriega was one ofthoseinvolved in helping set up the money chain that assisted the aliens. His arrestis a strongsignal that the pipeline of money to the aliens wil no longer be open.The Colombian Cartel is also ceasing operations. The shutting down of the drugcartel isa first step in removing the power of the aliens and pul ing back from theagreements.Government projections indicate that pul ing support from the clandestine drugtradewil curtail the United States drug problem by 1993, unless it is artificial ystimulated again as a pretext to martial law. It may not be necessary however,if the release of certaininformation makes national security paramount. It must be understood that therewasan enormous problem for the government when it discovered that the earth wasactually being held hostage to an alien influence and that there was noreasonabletechnology for dealing with this alien influence. President Truman made aconsiderableeffort to engage in combat with these aliens, but the technology of the UnitedStates atthe time was not advanced enough to even begin to have an effect. Therefore, theonly option—short of total obliteration of the human race in an all-out war—wasto formagreements for building, expanding and funding these bases.Americans may judge harshly the government for its action, but it was put in averydifficult and desperate situation in regard to national security. One choice wastoinform the people. Projections were that they would become outraged, perhapsdestroying the very fabric of society. Mobs were projected to demand militaryactionagainst a force which the government knew would be far superior. Projectionsalsoindicated people would demand the resignation of persons in office. They wouldbeperceived as having been making deals with an alien enemy without the peopleknowing of this. Under normal circumstances and under the Constitution, thatcould beclassed as treason.52The government has functioned in a manner it perceived to be in the bestinterest of humankind. Yet it has also been put in a predicament whereby itcould be misjudgedas having worked in collaboration with a foreign invading army. Had thegovernmentopposed the invaders, however, it would have led to mass destruction ofhumanity.Even nuclear weapons had little usefulness in dealing with foreign invaders onour ownsoil.The public cannot begin to understand what these people have gone through intermsof soul-searching and trying to find the best way to deal with the crisis whichthey wereforced to manage. The option of informing the people appeared less viable andworkable than to silently make negotiated deals with the aliens to keep thempacifiedover a period of time in an attempt to find a peaceful way of coexistence. MJ-12andthose who have been subordinate feel they have done everything possible andappropriate for the intense situation of hosting aliens with much greatertechnology onthe earth. It has done all it felt was proper to preserve peace and to gaininformationfrom the aliens in order to develop higher technology. It has also hidden vitalinformation and shielded certain knowledge when necessary from the aliens inorder tocreate weaponry that may be used against them in the event of conflict.There is now some division and debate between those in the upper echelons as towhether they should simply inform the people of the problem or continue to keepitquiet. Until this debate swings one way or the other, it is relatively hazardousto releasetoo much information on this. If it is decided that this information must bekept quiet,many of the sources that are releasing this information wil become targets forharassment or assassination. But the scenario now reveals that unlessinformation isreleased by the authorities and is accepted by the vast majority of people, mostAmericans wil not accept the information from an individual that claims to haveinnerknowledge of the government’s cover-up.There was an attempt to test whether the public would panic at the thought ofinvasionfrom aliens. It was the radio broadcast of Orson Welles in 1938. The publicreacted withpanic and many committed suicide. There is an effort now to condition the peopletobe more wil ing to accept an alien presence as a possibility using movies andtelevision-- Star Wars, ET, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Aliens, V, Alien Nationand War of theWorlds. Al of these are presenting various images and scenarios to condition thehuman mind to be open to what may soon be reality. The government does notdirecta studio to make these movies or TV shows, but scripts are submitted to certainpeoplewho are silent partners with certain agencies to encourage the script to be usedandhelp find funding sources to keep the script alive.The alien Nation scenario conditions the human mind to accept the presence ofalienswho are relatively friendly and who can coexist with humans. War of the Worlds,whichcontains a scenario of humanoid replicas and aliens living underground, showstheconflict between the aliens and humans. ET allows people not to be paranoid orfearful53[index-54_1.jpg][index-54_2.jpg]when thinking of aliens, as they may in fact be friendly. It gave people thecapacity todeal with frightening information that may otherwise cause serious insecurity.Right nowthere are so many different types of aliens being offered to the human mind thatpeople can accept or reject any or all of them. People are gradual y beingconditioned to the possibility of being informed officially. If that time comes,there wilnot be a great shock. In 1938, people did not have the preparation, and eventhoughaliens on earth were already a reality, they were not even prepared for afictionalrepresentation.Only now are people being told about the plan to set up a moon base that wouldlaterlead to a Mars landing and a Mars base. There has been a moon base for quitesometime, in the craterCopernicus.The United Statesofficially controlledthe base until 1969,when it was learnedthat the aliens wereworking with both theSoviets and theAmericans. TheSoviets gained theadvantage at thattime and took overthe base.But even though thereare competitions hereand there, much ofthe cold war wasactually a facade inorder to extract hugesums of money forA photo from the online archive of the Apol o 11 mission revealsother purposes. Muchwhat appears to be a base on the far side of the moon. Theof it was beingobject appears to be on the moon’s surface and is welldiverted to developingil uminated. It is symmetrical with a long shaft separated at eachend by a small sphere with another in the center The spherestechnologies that haveappear to be living quarters with connecting corridors.yet to be brought out andthat may be needed inthe event of conflict. The Tesla approach has for many decades been ignored bytheUnited States. But it has been developed and used in the Soviet Union. It is nowbeingused in the United States as a part of the Star Wars program to enhance and movefurther into the higher technologies. The Star Wars technology is essential ydesigned to54assist in dealing with the alien factor and the potential conflict. The Sovietsalready have laser cannons, beam weapons, certain types of shielding fields,anti-detectionfields that can be used to meet with other humans and speak about plans withoutbeing monitored by the aliens.Much of the apparent corruption of the government is actual y based on thisdilemmaof how to deal with this alien situation. There were certain benefits derivedfromagreements with the aliens as indicated in the works of Cooper, especial y inregardsto the Trilateralists and those who were involved in direct relationships withthe aliens.But this government was not alone in dealing with the alien situation. Thealiens werealso connected with the Bolsheviks in the Soviet Union and also the Nazis. Muchof thetechnology that the Nazis were developing during the war was actually given thembythe aliens, who were in part behind the Nazi rise to power and the influencesassociated with some of the hidden philosophies of Hitler and those of the innergroup.During the time immediately following World War I , the sightings of UFOs invarious partsof the world were quite frequent, with an aura of mystery and much governmentscrambling to discover what the purpose of the aliens were. The government wasaware of their presence and had agreements that reached back to 1933, althoughthey were not always sure what the aliens were up to during al of this time.Later, thetechnology exchange between the United States and these aliens began to have itsgreater influence and the funding action began. It was in the 1930s that theNazis hadcloser ties with the Zeta Reticuli Greys. More on that in another upload.ALIEN BASESThere are alien bases in: Brazil Argentina the United States the Aleutian Islands China the Arctic and Antarctica New Zealand Australia Canada underwater in various oceans on the earth55There have been a number of bases within the United States. Some of these wereclosed by secret raids of government teams that were especial y established todefusethe influence and presence of these bases, particularly during the 1960s andearly1970s. These DELTA teams would go down into various caves to shut down certaincomputers and in the event they ran into any aliens inhabiting the caves, therewouldbe an engagement. They were successful in some areas and failed in others.This occurred in many more areas than just the Dulce Base. Later these teamswerestopped by MJ-12 and a cooperative effort was made to work with the aliens untilitwas again discovered that the aliens were not honoring their agreements and werenotto be trusted. Most who were involved with such teams have since died for onereasonor another, often under mysterious circumstances. Many of those who were workingtohinder the aliens were covertly kil ed, especial y those who had special skil sin raidingthese caves.Most caves in the United States in general are usual y safe unless there arestraight,carved wal s and smooth floors. Those are generally artificial y createdentrances to anunderground base. They should be avoided unless you would like to end yourexistence. Likewise, those who see a spacecraft would be foolish to walk up toit orapproach it. Those who have been abductees do not usual y report great benefitsfromthe experience. Generally, abductees have been used as guinea pigs forexperimentation and have disappeared permanently. Many of the missingchildren have, in fact, been taken by aliens.ABDUCTIONSAbout one in every hundred people has been abducted by a UFO whether they knowit or not. There is a blue ray which they use during the abductions thatcaptures peopleand beams them up into the ship. The action of being beamed into the ship with ablueray actual y suffocates the person, causing all oxygen to be sucked from theperson’scel s, so that they hover near death for a moment. Upon arrival in the ship,they arerevived by another ray that restores oxygen into the cells.Many abductions are of a quite cruel nature. Humans would not want to rememberwhat happened in some of the clinical experimentation or examinations thatoccurred. The aliens have a vacuum tube that follows up through the rectum andaround into the intestines, sucking out fecal matter, which they examine forpurposes oftheir own research. They are looking at the kinds of food that was eaten andexaminingthe effects on the person’s health.They implant chips through the nose, the back of the neck and the back of theheadnear the right ear during times when the subject is conscious, but in a state ofmentaland physical paralysis. The subject is not unconscious as if they were sedated.Thealiens have the ability to block the memory of the experience through the use of56certain injections and drugs into specific areas of the brain. Zeta Greys abducthumans and use them for genetic experiments. They take the souls from thosehumans and putthem in replicas and release them after having altered them to some degree. Theymay appear to be the same person—and the soul is in fact the same, the body isnew—and certain aspects of the memory and personality have been alteredslightly.The aliens create replica bodies into which souls are transplanted from one bodyintoanother. This has been portrayed on the television series War of the Worlds.This is ameans by which these aliens snatch bodies and control people to make them theirown. Much of this occurs in underground caverns. When people who havedisappeared for some time and then are released, there is a possibility thatthis hasoccurred to them. The aliens do not see this as cruel. It is simply theirunusual culture.They have been abducting humans for centuries. They see the earth as a big farmandhave been raising humans for their harvest. They often abduct them and take themback to their home planet to raise there as a form of animal husbandry.Their main problem is with their cloning process. In the recloning, each copy ofeachcopy of each copy weakens repeatedly so that they are, in effect, a dying race.Thishas stimulated their interest in creating a new being through geneticengineering, usinghuman or some other source as a new genetic substance to reenergize the cloningprocess, or to create a merging of their own race with another.END OF COLD WAR, REPTILIANS HEADING THIS WAYThere is much that has not been released in the Cooper information, which isgeneral yvery accurate as far as it goes. Much more wil surface in the coming decade,eventually being given by people within the government.There is now a conflict between two factions within the government agencies. Onefaction sees the necessity of working with the aliens to set up a One Worldgovernment in which it sees itself as being the power behind the throne. Theotherfaction sees the aliens as a threat to humanity and wishes to expose theinformation, letthe public know and prevent the aliens from gaining control of the planet.Those who are collaborators with the aliens do not want the informationreleased. Theyare continuing the cover-up out of fear that the people would blame them,considerthem traitors and hold them responsible for all that is due to an alienpresence. Therewas a time when these leaders realized that many humans were being sacrificed tofeed the alien appetites. They had a choice of making a clean break with thealiens orat least of telling the people or of continuing the cover-up. They chose not to.The alien threat is the single major factor in the attempt to unify andharmonize nationsof the earth. The threat is not only from those who are already present on theearth intheir bases, but also from craft that have been recognized as being on their waytoearth. To stop this cooperative effort, there are certain elements attempting tostir up57heavy conflicts in certain areas, particularly to bring down Gorbachev and hisreforms.These are being influenced by the aliens, through their agents. There are manypeoplewho have been implanted with chips over the years and they are being activatednow. It doesn’t appear there is sufficient energy behind the the alien endeavorat thistime, however. The money supply for the aliens which has been extorted fromgovernments and government agencies is gradual y diminishing. It’s being cut offand ishindering the construction and development of many of their projects and plans.Thishas weakened them.There is a hidden war in progress, but one that is not highly charged. It is ona level ofquiet competition between the aliens and the governments of the world. But therearecertain elements of humans that are working hand in hand with the aliens tryingto helpregain control of the governments which the aliens once control ed.Within Cooper’s material, there is a reference to the Fatima prophecy, beingthat whichaliens pul ed out of the future. The aliens claim to have the ability see intothe futureand have helped bring about this apparition. Before the aliens revealed it, alongstanding theory by this government was that the unreleased third Fatimaprophecy dealt with a nuclear war and its aftermath. This prophecy was kepthiddenfrom the people.What was not revealed, however, was that the alien situation was directly linkedto thisnuclear war prophecy. In truth, the aliens were hoping to contribute toinstability on thisearth so that nuclear war would come. It was their intention to bring aboutenoughdevastation on the earth so as to make the planet easily conquerable, while stilretaining some degree of human life to serve them as slaves.With their technologies, they can eliminate radioactive contamination. Theyplanned toinhabit the remains of the earth without any threat of human domination. But thescenario of the Fatima prophecies is in no way preordained. Rather, it was atimetableof the alien plans to conquer the earth. It was scheduled to begin in February1990, butit was not written in stone. It was simply the intention of the aliens to beginthen.At that time, it was intended by the aliens that the information about them bereleasedby the government so that humans would be prepared to accept the inevitableoutcome. They had hopes of triggering the exchange of nuclear weapons—preferablyin the Middle East where people are expecting Armageddon to begin—and thensuddenly stop the escalation with their own technology. They would then passthemselves off as divine beings and bring forth the Mil ennium.There are certain efforts which are being attempted at present to use the BookofRevelation to create the appearance of a coming Messiah. This timetable for theArmageddon/Second Coming scenario has been dashed recently by the lessening ofthe threat of nuclear war. It was at a fever pitch in the early and mid-1980s,but hassince died down. The aliens have, in effect, missed that window of opportunity.The58people are not now expecting a nuclear war and the Fatima timetable is of littleuse to the aliens. But they have not abandoned it. It has simply been shifted tobeginaround 1992.The government believes, however, that the people wil not accept this scenarioasbeing true. Many have been conditioned by the Book of Revelation into believingthatthey wil be rescued, but for the most part people wil not believe it and wilassume it isin fact, one of the false prophet Biblical scenarios predicted before the actualSecondComing.There is a strong potential that during this decade the aliens and humans wilclash incombat over domination of the earth. There is a potential that this could becovert, butit may become overt. The possibility of reconciliation is growing more remote asthealiens seem less ready to negotiate a situation in which coexistence can occur.Itshould not be ruled out, however. Pressures are now being put on the alienswhich maylead to a more conciliatory stand. This following information been deemedunsuitablefor the public at this time and there have been and wil be more kil ings to keepsuchinformation secret.There is a threat of an invasion of 30 mil ion or more reptilian aliens whichcontrol theGreys. There are smal er numbers of smaller ships heading this way, but nothingcompared in size to the small planetoid that is heading toward this planet,which isapproximately the size of the state of Pennsylvania. It does not travel at abovelightspeed as do other craft because it is so enormous and holds so many aliens. Itpassednear the planet in 1989, dropped off some reptilian aliens and headed out to theDracoconstellation in early summer of 1989. The timetable for the arrival back toearthis approximately 2020, depending on what may happen near Draco. The HubbleTelescope has as its primary mission the task of tracking the return of thecraft.The base in Dulce, New Mexico now has 100,000 aliens living within it at thistime.Another 100,000 more have moved through the Dulce Base to other bases. Thealiens continue to enter the earth at a rate of 20,000 per month. The base atAda, Oklahoma is stil very active. The recent floods artificially created andallowed"},{"pageContent":"there were an attempt to slow and hinder activities there.The aliens are attempting to move their entire planetary population from theirdyingplanet as quickly as possible, prior to the arrival of the Draco reptilians.Presently, theassessment of those in the inner circles who are dealing with the alien invasionthreat isthat the Reptilians have every intention of ruling this planet. There are manywho feelthat the aliens have such a high technology that they cannot be defeated.The next potential scenario in relation to the expected invasion is the releaseby thegovernment of the information relating to the Grays and their earth bases, butreleasingit in such a way that is favorable to the government. Claims wil be made thatany otherversion is but that of troublemakers.59[index-60_1.png][index-60_2.png][index-60_3.png][index-60_4.png][index-60_5.png][index-60_6.png][index-60_7.png]If the release of information comes before 1996, and especial y if it occursprior to 1995,you can be correct in assuming it is staged by the government to set up theatmosphere for a One World government. If it is held off until 1996 orthereafter, you canassume the information released is real and that the Reptilian ship is headingthis wayand poses a real threat. The Draco Reptilians do not real y need the earth. Theyhavemore room than they need to grow and thrive. They simply want the earth as akind ofstrategic point in their battle to conquer the entire galaxy.The Pleiadeans may return by 1993, and you would know them by their ships, whichhave the symbol of a serpent climbing a vine. The symbol for the Reptilians is adragon.The Grey’s symbol is a cobra.There is also a potential for martial law occurring in this country, in whichmany of thosetroublemakers, who hold to the story that the government was involved with thealiens in the abduction of humans, would be rounded up and imprisoned along withmany who have been implanted because of potential threats to this country’ssecurity.People who are releasing this information are not fully out of danger justbecause manypeople know about it. You may recal that in China, just about everyone knew whatoccurred in Tiananmen Square, and yet today, you wil not find anyone in Chinawhowil talk about it. There is now an open window in which people can talk, spreadtheword, discuss it, show the videos and photographs. The more that occurs now,before amartial law crackdown, the more chance there is of having the truth come out.Once that window is closed, if enough people are not already informed, theinformation could stil be curtailed and hidden. At present, only 2 to 3 percentof theUnited States population has half of the story and only one half percent has thefullstory.PERSPECTIVEAccording to Mr. Cooper: Many sources of information were used to research thischapter.I original y wrote this piece as a research paper. It was first delivered at theMUFONSymposium on July 2,1989, in Las Vegas, Nevada. Most of this knowledge comesdirectlyfrom, or is a result of my own research into the TOP SECRET/MAJIC material whichI sawand read between the years 1970 and 1973 as a member of the Intel igenceBriefingTeam of the Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet.60Since some of this information was derived from sources that I cannot divulgefor obvious reasons, and from published sources which I cannot vouch for, thischaptermust be termed a hypothesis. I firmly believe that if aliens are real, this isthe true nature of the Beast. It is the only scenario that has been able to bindall the diverse elements. Itis the only scenario that answers all the questions and places the variousfundamentalmysteries in an arena that makes sense.It is the only explanation which shows the chronology of events and demonstratesthatthe chronologies, when assembled, match perfectly. The bulk of this I believe tobe trueif the material that I viewed in the Navy is authentic. As for the rest, I donot know, andthat is why this paper must be termed a hypothesis.Most historic and current available evidence supports this hypothesis.Before Majestic 12During the years following World War II the government of the United States wasconfronted with a series of events which were to change beyond prediction itsfutureand with it the future of humanity.These events were so incredible that they defied belief. A stunned PresidentTrumanand his top military commanders found themselves virtual y impotent after havingjustwon the most devastating and costly war in history.The United States had developed, used, and was the only nation on earth inpossessionof the atomic bomb. This new weapon had the potential to destroy any enemy, andeven the Earth itself. At that time the United States had the best economy, themostadvanced technology, the highest standard of living, exerted the most influence,andfielded the largest and most powerful military forces in history.We can only imagine the con- fusion and concern when the informed elite of theUnited States Government discovered that an alien spacecraft piloted byinsect-likebeings from totally incomprehensible culture had crashed in the desert of NewMexico.Between January 1947 and December 1952 at least 16 crashed or downed aliencraft,65 alien bodies, and 1 live alien were recovered. An additional alien craft hadexploded and nothing was recovered from that incident. Of these events, 13occurredwithin the borders of the United States, not including the craft whichdisintegrated in theair.Of these 13, 1 was in Arizona, 11 were in New Mexico, and 1 was in Nevada. Threeoccurred in foreign countries. Of those, 1 was in Norway and the last 2 were inMexico.Sightings of UFOs were so numerous that serious investigation and debunking ofeachreport became impossible, utilizing the existing intel igence assets.61Alien-Earth PresenceAn alien craft was found on February 13, 1948, on a mesa near Aztec, New Mexico.Another craft was located on March 25, 1948, in White Sands Proving Ground. Itwas100 feet in diameter.A total of 17 alien bodies were recovered from those two crafts. Of even greatersignificance was the discovery of a large number of human body parts storedwithinboth of these vehicles. A demon had reared its head and paranoia quickly tookhold ofeveryone then \"in the know.\"The Secret lid immediately became a Top Secret lid and was screwed down tight.Thesecurity blanket was even tighter than that imposed upon the Manhattan Project.Inthe coming years these events were to become the most closely guarded secrets inthehistory of the world.A special group of America's top scientists were organized under the nameProjectSIGN in December 1947 to study the phenomenon. The whole nasty business wascontained. Project SIGN evolved into Project GRUDGE in December 1948. Alow-levelcollection and disinformation project named BLUE BOOK was formed under GRUDGE.Sixteen volumes were to come out of GRUDGE.\"Blue Teams\" were put together to recover the crashed disks and dead or livealiens.The Blue Teams were later to evolve into Alpha Teams under Project POUNCE.Duringthese early years the United States Air Force and the Central intel igenceAgencyexercised complete control over the \"alien secret.\"In fact, the CIA was formed by Presidential Executive Order first as the CentralIntelligence Group for the express purpose of dealing with the alien presence.Later theNational Security Act was passed, establishing it as the Central Intel igenceAgency.The National Security Council was established to oversee the intel igencecommunityand especially the alien endeavor.A series of National Security Council memos and Executive orders removed the CIAfrom the sole task of gathering foreign intelligence and slowly but thoroughly\"legalized\"direct action in the form of covert activities at home and abroad.Intelligence GatheringOn December 9, 1947, Truman approved issuance of NSC-4, entitled \"CoordinationofForeign Intelligence Information Measures\" at the urging of Secretaries Marshal,Forrestal, Patterson, and the director of the State Department's Policy PlanningStaff,George Kennan.The Foreign and Military Intel igence, Book 1, \"Final Report of the SelectCommittee toStudy Governmental operations with respect to Intel igence Activities,\" UnitedStatesSenate, 94th Congress, 2nd Session, Report No. 94-755, April 26,1976, p. 49,states:62\"This directive empowered the Secretary of State to coordinate overseasinformation activities designed to counter communism.\"A Top Secret annex to NSC-4, NSC-4A, instructed the director of CentralIntelligence toundertake covert psychological activities in pursuit of the aims set forth inNSC-4.The initial authority given the CIA for covert operations under NSC-4A did notestablishformal procedures for either coordinating or approving these operations. Itsimplydirected the DCI to \"undertake covert actions and to ensure, through liaisonwith Stateand Defense, that the resulting operations were consistent with Americanpolicy.\"Later NSC-10/1 and NSC-10/2 were to supersede NSC-4 and NSC-4A and expand thecovert abilities even further. The Office of Policy Coordination (OPC) waschartered tocarry out an expanded program of covert activities. NSC-10/1 and NSC-10/2validatedil egal and extralegal practices and procedures as being agreeable to thenationalsecurity leadership.The reaction was swift. In the eyes of the intelligence community \"no holds werebarred.\"Under NSC-10/1 an Executive Coordination Group was established to review, butnotapprove, covert project proposals. The ECG was secretly tasked to coordinate thealienprojects. NSC-10/1 & /2 were interpreted to mean that no one at the top wantedtoknow about anything until it was over and successful.These actions established a buffer between the President and the information. Itwasintended that this buffer serve as a means for the President to deny knowledgeif leaksdivulged the true state of affairs. This buffer was used in later years for thepurpose ofeffectively isolating succeeding Presidents from any knowledge of the alienpresenceother than what the Secret Government and the intel igence community wanted themto know.NSC-10/2 established a study panel which met secretly and was made up of thescientific minds of the day. The study panel was not cal ed MJ-12. Another NSCmemo,NSC-10/5 further outlined the duties of the study panel.These NSC memos and secret Executive orders set the stage for the creation ofMJ-12only four years later.First Victim of the Cover-upSecretary of Defense James Forrestal objected to the secrecy. He was a veryidealisticand religious man. He believed that the public should be told. James Forrestalwas alsoone of the first known abductees. When he began to talk to leaders of theoppositionparty and leaders of the Congress about the alien problem he was asked to resignbyTruman. He expressed his fears to many people. Rightful y, he believed that hewasbeing watched. This was interpreted by those who were ignorant of the facts as63paranoia. Forrestal later was said to have suffered a mental breakdown. He wasordered to the mental ward of Bethesda Naval Hospital. In spite of the fact thattheAdministration had no authority to have him committed, the order was carriedout. Infact, it was feared that Forrestal would begin to talk again.He had to be isolated and discredited. His family and friends were deniedpermission tovisit. Finally, on May 21, 1949, Forrestal's brother made a fateful decision. Henotifiedauthorities that he intended to remove James from Bethesda on May 22.Sometime in the early morning of May 22,1949, agents of the CIA tied a sheetaroundJames Forrestal's neck, fastened the other end to a fixture in his room, thenthrew JamesForrestal out the window. The sheet tore and he plummeted to his death. JamesForrestal's secret diaries were confiscated by the CIA and were kept in theWhite Housefor many years. Due to public demand the diaries were eventual y rewritten andpublished in a sanitized version. The real diary information was later furnishedby the CIAin book form to an agent who published the material as fiction. The name of theagentis Whitley Strieber and the book is Majestic. James Forrestal became one of thefirstvictims of the cover-up.EBEThe live alien that had been found wandering in the desert from the 1949 Roswelcrashwas named EBE. The name had been suggested by Dr. Vannevar Bush and was shortfor Extraterrestrial Biological Entity. EBE had a tendency to lie, and for overa year wouldgive only the desired answer to questions asked. Those questions which wouldhaveresulted in an undesirable answer went unanswered.At some point during the second year of captivity he began to open up. Theinformation derived from EBE was startling, to say the least. This compilationof hisrevelations became the foundation of what would later be called the \"YellowBook.\"Photographs were taken of EBE which, among others, I was to view years laterProjectGrudge. In late 1951 EBE became il . Medical personnel had been unable todeterminethe cause of EBE's il ness and had no background from which to draw. EBE'ssystem waschlorophyl -based and he processed food into energy much the same as plants.Wastematerial was excreted the same as plants.Several experts were called in to study the il ness. These specialists includedmedicaldoctors, botanists, and entomologists. A botanist, Dr. Guil ermo Mendoza, wasbroughtin to try and help him recover. Dr. Mendoza worked to save EBE until June 2,1952, whenEBE died. Dr. Mendoza became the expert on at least this type alien of biology.Themovie E.T. is the thinly disguised story of EBE.In a futile attempt to save EBE and to gain favor with this technological ysuperior race,the United States began broadcasting a cal for help early in 1952 into the vastregions64of space. The call went unanswered but the project, dubbed SIGMA, continued asan effort of good faith.Creation of the NSAPresident Truman created the super-secret National Security Agency (NSA) bysecretExecutive order on November 4,1952. Its primary purpose was to decipher thealiencommunications, language, and establish a dialogue with the extraterrestrials.This mosturgent task was a continuation of the earlier effort.The National Security Agency (NSA), an independently organized entity within theDepartment of Defense, is the product of efforts at unifying and coordinatingdefensecryptologic and communications security functions.In the first postwar years, the cryptologic duties of the American armed forcesreposedin the separate agencies of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force.The Army, at least, charged its agency with maintaining, \"liaison with theDepartment ofthe Navy, Department of the Air Force, and other appropriate agencies, for thepurpose of coordinating communication security and communication intelligenceequipment and procedures.\" Presumably the Navy and the Air Force units weresimilarlycharged.This arrangement, which relied on internal desire instead of external direction,prolonged the abuses [once] hinted at by [General Douglas MacArthur's World WarIintel igence chief. Major General Charles A.] Wil oughby.To rectify them and achieve the benefits of centralized control, the DefenseDepartment in 1949 established the Armed Forces Security Agency.The A.F.S.A. took over the strategic communications-intelligence functions andthecoordination responsibilities of the individual agencies.It left them with tactical communications intelligence, which can best beperformednear the point of combat and not at a central location (except for basic systemsolutions), and with low-echelon communications security, which differsradically inground, sea, and air forces. Even in these areas, A.F.S.A, backed them up.A.F.S.A. drew its personnel from the separate departmental agencies, thoughit later hired separately, and housed itself in their buildings.The success of the unified approach to cryptology evidenced by the operations oftheArmed Forces Security Agency warranted an expansion of that institution toincludecryptosystems outside of the Defense Department, such as those maintained byState.65Accordingly, President Truman promulgated a classified directive creating theNational Security Agency on November 4, 1952, abolishing the Armed ForcesSecurity Agency,and transferring its assets and personnel to the new successor.Such an aura of official secrecy surrounded NSA that no acknowledgement of itsexistence appeared in the government organization manuals until 1957 when abrief,but vague, description was offered.In brief, according to one expert, NSA, \"creates and supervises the cryptographyof allU.S. Government agencies\" and \"it interprets, traffic-analyzes, andcryptanalyzes the messages of all other nations, friend as wel as foe.\"It is the American Black Chamber reincarnated with the most highly sophisticatedtechnology available, an estimated staff of 20,000 employees at its home base(FortMeade, Maryland) with between 50,000 to 100,000 persons in its service overseas,andan annual budget thought to range between $1 and $1.2 billion.According to best estimates, the National Security Agency is organized intothreeoperating divisions - the Office of Production (code and cipher breaking), theOffice ofCommunications Security (code and cipher production), and the Office of Researchand Development (digital computing and radio propagation research,cryptanalysis,and development of communications equipment) - and supporting units forrecruitingand hiring, training, and the maintenance of both physical and personnelsecurity.The secondary purpose of the NSA was to monitor al communications and emissionsfrom any and all electronic devices worldwide for the purpose of gatheringintel igence, both human and alien, and to contain the secret of the alienpresence.Project SIGMA was successful.The NSA also maintains communications with the Luna base and other secret spaceprograms. By executive order of the President, the NSA is exempt from all lawswhich donot specifical y name the NSA in the text of the law as being subject to thatlaw. Thatmeans that if the agency is not spelled out in the text of any and every lawpassed bythe Congress it is not subject to that or those laws.The NSA now performs many other duties and in fact is the premier agency withintheintel igence network. Today the NSA receives approximately 75% of the moniesallottedto the intelligence community. The old saying \"where the money goes therein thepower resides\" is true. The DCI today is a figurehead maintained as a publicruse.The primary task of the NSA is stil alien communications, but now includes otherextraterrestrial projects as well. President Truman had been keeping our allies,includingthe Soviet Union, informed of the developing alien problem. This had been doneincase the aliens turned out to be a threat to the human race.66Plans were formulated to defend the Earth in case of invasion. Great difficultywas encountered in maintaining international secrecy. It was decided that anoutsidegroup was necessary to coordinate and control international efforts in order tohide thesecret from the normal scrutiny of governments by the press.The result was the formation of a secret ruling body which became known as theBilderberger Group. The group was formed and met for the first time in 1952.They werenamed after the first publicly known meeting place, the Bilderberg Hotel. Thatpublicmeeting took place in 1954. They were nicknamed The Bilderbergers. Theheadquartersof this group is Geneva, Switzerland. The Bilderbergers evolved into a secretworldgovernment that now controls everything. The United Nations was then, and is nowaninternational joke.A New PresidentBeginning in 1953 a new president occupied the White House. He was a man used toastructured staff organization with a chain of command. His method was todelegateauthority and rule by committee. He made major decisions, but only when hisadvisorswere unable to come to a consensus. His normal method was to read through orlistento several alternatives and then approve one.Those who worked closely with him have stated that his favorite comment was,\"Just dowhatever it takes.\" He spent a lot of time on the golf course. This was notunusual for a man who had been career Army with the ultimate position of SupremeAl iedCommander during the war, a post which had earned him five stars.The President was General of the Army Dwight David Eisenhower. During his firstyear inoffice, 1953, at least 10 more crashed discs were recovered along with 26 deadand 4live aliens. Of the 10,4 were found in Arizona, 2 in Texas, 1 in New Mexico, 1in Louisiana,1 in Montana, and 1 in South Africa. There were hundreds of sightings.Eisenhower knew that he had to wrestle and beat the alien problem. He knew thathecould not do it by revealing the secret to the Congress. Early in 1953 the newPresidentturned to his friend and fel ow member of the Council on Foreign RelationsNelsonRockefel er. Eisenhower and Rockefel er began planning the secret structure ofalien-task supervision, which was to become a reality within one year.The idea for MJ-12 was thus born. It was Nelson's uncle Winthrop Aldrich who hadbeencrucial in convincing Eisenhower to run for President. The whole Rockefel erfamily andwith them, the Rockefeller empire, had solidly backed Ike. Eisenhower belongedheartand soul to the Council on Foreign Relations and the Rockefel er family. AskingRockefel er for help with the alien problem was to be the biggest mistakeEisenhowerever made for the future of the United States and maybe for humanity.67Within one week of Eisenhower's election he had appointed Nelson Rockefellerchairman of a Presidential Advisory Committee on Government Organization.Rockefel er was responsible for planning the reorganization of the government,something he had dreamed of for many years. New Deal programs went into onesingle cabinet position cal ed the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.When the Congress approved the new Cabinet position in April 1953, Nelson wasnamed to the post of Undersecretary to Oveta Culp Hobby.Heading For EarthIn 1953 astronomers discovered large objects in space which were tracked movingtoward the Earth.It was first believed that they were asteroids. Later evidence proved that theobjectscould only be spaceships. Project SIGMA intercepted alien radio communications.When the objects reached the Earth they took up a very high geosynchronous orbitaround the equator. There were several huge ships, and their actual intent wasunknown.Project SIGMA and a new project, PLATO, through radio communications using thecomputer binary language, were able to arrange a landing that resulted inface-to-face contact with alien beings from another planet. This landing took place inthedesert. The movie, Close Encounters of the Third Kind is a fictionalized versionof theactual events.Project PLATO was tasked with establishing diplomatic relations with this raceof spacealiens. A hostage was left with us as a pledge that they would return andformalize atreaty.In the meantime, a race of humanoid aliens landed at Homestead Air Force Base inFlorida and successfully communicated with the U.S. government. This groupwarned usagainst the race orbiting the equator and offered to help us with our spiritualdevelopment. They demanded that we dismantle and destroy our nuclear weapons asthe major condition.They refused to exchange technology citing that we were spiritually unable tohandlethe technology we already possessed. These overtures were rejected on thegroundsthat it would be foolish to disarm in the face of such an uncertain future.There was notrack record to read from. It may have been an unfortunate decision.A third landing at Muroc, now Edwards Air Force Base, took place in 1954. Thebase wasclosed for three days and no one was allowed to enter or leave during that time.Thehistorical event had been planned in advance. Details of a treaty had beenagreedupon. Eisenhower arranged to be in Palm Springs on vacation.68On the appointed day the President was spirited to the base. The excuse wasgiven to the press that he was visiting a dentist. Witnesses to the event havestated that threeUFOs flew over the base and then landed. Antiaircraft batteries were undergoinglive-fire training and the startled personnel actual y fired at the crafts as theypassedoverhead. Luckily, the shel s missed and no one was injured.Formal Treaty SignedPresident Eisenhower met with the aliens on February 20, 1954, and a formaltreatybetween the alien nation and the United States of America was signed.We then received our first alien ambassador from outer space. He was the hostagethathad been left at the first landing in the desert. His name and title was HisOmnipotentHighness Cril l or Kril l, pronounced Cril or Kril .In the American tradition of disdain for royal titles he was secretly cal edOriginalHostage Crl l, or Krl l. Shortly after this meeting President Eisenhowersuffered a heartattack.Four others present at the meeting were Franklin Al en of the Hearst newspapers,EdwinNourse of Brookings Institute, Gerald Light of metaphysical research fame, andCatholicBishop MacIntyre of Los Angeles. Their reaction was judged as a microcosm ofwhat thepublic reaction might be.Based upon this reaction, it was decided that the public could not be told.Later studiesconfirmed the decision as sound. An emotionally revealing letter written byGerald Lightspel s it out in chil ing detail:\"My dear Friend:I have just returned from Muroc. The report is true - devastatingly true! I madethejourney in company with Franklin Al en of the Hearst papers and Edwin Nourse ofBrookings Institute (Truman's erstwhile financial adviser) and Bishop Maclntyreof L.A.(confidential names for the present, please.)When we were allowed to enter the restricted section (after about six hours inwhich wewere checked on every possible item, event, incident and aspect of our personalandpublic lives), I had the distinct feeling that the world had come to an end withfantasticrealism. For I have never seen so many human beings in a state of complete colapseand confusion, as they realized that their own world had indeed ended with suchfinality as to beggar description.The reality of \"other-plane\" aeroforms is now and forever removed from therealms of speculation and made a rather painful part of the consciousness ofevery responsiblescientific and political group.69[index-70_1.jpg]During my two days' visit I saw five separate and distinct types of aircraftbeing studiedand handled by our Air Force officials - with the assistance and permission oftheEtherians!\"I have no words to express my reactions. It has finally happened. It is now amatter ofhistory. President Eisenhower, as you may already know, was spirited over toMuroc onenight during his visit to Palm Springs recently. And it is my conviction that hewil ignorethe terrific conflict between the various \"authorities\" and go directly to thepeople via radio and television - if the impasse continues much longer.From what I could gather, an official statement to the country is being preparedfordelivery about the middle of May.\"We know that no such announcement was ever made. The silence-control group wonthe day.We also know that two more ships, for which we can find no witnesses, eitherlandedsometime after the three or were already at the base before the three landed.GeraldLight specifically states that five ships were present and were undergoing studyby theAir Force. His metaphysical experience is evident in that he calls the entities\"Etherians.\"Gerald Light capitalized \"Etherians,\" calling attention to the fact that thesebeings might have been viewed as gods by Mr. Light.The alien emblem was known as the \"Trilateral insignia\" and was displayed on thecraft and worn on the alien uniforms. Both of these landings and the secondmeeting werefilmed. These films exist today.The treaty stated that the aliens would not interfere in our affairs and wewould notinterfere in theirs.We would keep their presence on earth a secret. They would furnish us withadvancedtechnology and would help us in our technological development. They would notmake any treaty with any other Earth nation.They could abduct humans on a limited and periodic basis for the purpose ofmedicalexamination and monitoring of our development, with the stipulation that thehumans70would not be harmed, would be returned to their point of abduction, would haveno memory of the event, and that the alien nation would furnish Majesty Twelvewith a listof all human contacts and abductees on a regularly scheduled basis.It was agreed that each nation would receive the ambassador of the other for aslongas the treaty remained in force. It was further agreed that the alien nation andtheUnited States would exchange 16 personnel with the purpose of learning of eachother.The alien \"guests'' would remain on earth. The human \"guests\" would travel tothe alien point of origin for a specified period of time, then return, at whichpoint a reverseexchange would be made.A reenactment of this event was dramatized in the movie Close Encounters of theThirdKind. A tip-off to who works for whom can be determined by the fact that Dr. J.Al enHynek served as the technical advisor for the film.I noticed that the Top Secret report containing the official version of thetruth of thealien question, entitled Project GRUDGE, which I read while in the Navy, was co-authored by Lt. Col. Friend and Dr. J. Al en Hynek, who was cited as a CIA assetattached to Project GRUDGE - Dr. Hynek, the one who debunked many legitimate UFOincidents when he functioned as the scientific member of the very public ProjectBLUEBOOK.Dr. Hynek is the man responsible for the infamous \"it was only swamp gas\"statement.It was agreed that bases would be constructed underground for the use of thealiennation and that two bases would be constructed for the joint use of the aliennationand the United States Government. Exchange of technology would take place in thejointly occupied bases.These alien bases would be constructed under Indian reservations in the FourCornersarea of Utah, Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona, and one would be constructed inanarea known as Dreamland. Dreamland was built in the Mojave Desert near, or in, aplace cal ed Yucca.More info is available in these books:SECRETS OF THE DULCE BASEhttp://www.blue-planet-project.com/Secrets-of-Dulce-Base.html[http://www.blue-planet-project.com/Secrets-of-Dulce-Base.html]ALIEN UNDERGROUND BASEShttp://www.blue-planet-project.com/Alien-Underground-Bases.html[http://www.blue-planet-project.com/Alien-Underground-Bases.html]71I cannot remember if it was Yucca Valley, Yucca Flat, or Yucca Proving Ground,but Yucca Valley is what I always seem to want to say. More UFO sightings andincidentsoccur in the Mojave Desert of California than any other place in the world.So many, in fact, that no one even bothers to make reports. Anyone who venturesintothe desert to talk to the residents wil be astounded by the frequency ofactivity andwith the degree of acceptance demonstrated by those who have come to regardUFOs as normal.Al alien areas are under complete control of the Naval Department, according tothedocuments that I read. Al personnel who work in these complexes receive theirchecksfrom the Navy through a subcontractor. The checks never make reference to thegovernment or the Navy. Construction of the bases began immediately, butprogresswas slow. Large amounts of money were made available in 1957. Work continued onthe Yellow Book.Area 51 and S-4Project REDLIGHT was formed and experimentation in test-flying alien craft wasbegunin earnest. A super-Top Secret facility was built at Groom Lake in Nevada in themidst ofthe weapons test range. It was code-named Area 51. The installation was placedunderthe Department of the Navy and all personnel required a Q clearance as well asExecutive presidential, cal ed MAJESTIC approval.This is ironic, due to the fact that the President of the United States does nothaveclearance to visit the site. The alien base and exchange of technology actual ytookplace in an area code-named Dreamland above ground, and the undergroundportion was dubbed \"the Dark Side of the Moon.\"According to the documentation that I read, at least 600 alien beings actual yresidedfull time at this site along with an unknown number of scientists and CIApersonnel. Dueto the fear of implantation, only certain people were allowed to interface withthe alienbeings, and those personnel were and are watched and monitored continuously.The Army was tasked to form a super-secret organization to furnish security forthe alien-tasked projects.This organization became the National Reconnaissance Organization based at FortCarson, Colorado. The specific teams trained to secure the projects were calledDelta.Lt. Col. James \"Bo\" Gritz was a Delta Force Commander. A second project code-named SNOWBIRD was promulgated to ex-plain away any sightings of the REDLIGHTcrafts as being Air Force experiments.72The SNOWBIRD crafts were manufactured using conventional technology and wereflown for the press on several occasions. Project SNOWBIRD[http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_mj12_3g6.htm]wasalso used to debunk legitimate public sightings of alien craft (UFOs to thepublic, IACs to those in the know).Project SNOW- BIRD was very successful, and reports from the public declinedsteadilyuntil recent years.Secret FundingA multimil ion-dol ar Secret fund was organized and kept by the Military Officeof theWhite House.This fund was used to build over 75 deep underground facilities. Presidents whoaskedwere told the fund was used to build deep underground shelters for the Presidentincase of war. Only a few were built for the President.Mil ions of dol ars were funneled through this office to Majesty Twelve and thenout tothe contractors. It was used to build Top Secret alien bases as wel as TopSecret DUMB(Deep Underground Military Bases) and the facilities promulgated by Alternative2throughout the nation. President Johnson used this fund to build a movie theaterandpave the road on his ranch. He had no idea of its true purpose.The secret White House underground-construction fund was set up in 1957 byPresidentEisenhower. The funding was obtained from Congress under the guise of:\"Construction and maintenance of secret sites where the President could be takenincase of military attack: Presidential Emergency Sites.\"The sites are literally holes in the ground, deep enough to withstand a nuclearblast,and are outfitted with state-of-the-art communications equipment.To date there are more than 75 sites spread around the country which were builtusingmoney from this fund. The Atomic Energy Com- mission has built at least anadditional22 underground sites.The location and everything to do with these sites were and are considered andtreated as Top Secret. The money was and is in control of the Military Office oftheWhite House, and was and is laundered through so circuitous a web that even themostknowledgeable spy or accountant cannot fol ow it. As of 1980 only a few at thebeginning and end of this web knew what the money was for.At the beginning were Representative George Mahon of Texas, the chairman of theHouse Appropriations Committee and of its Defense Subcommittee; andRepresentative Robert Sikes of Florida, chairman of the House AppropriationsMilitaryConstruction Subcommittee.73Today it is rumored that House Speaker Jim Wright con- trol ed the money inCongress and that a power struggle removed him. At the end of the line were thePresident,Majesty Twelve, the director of the Military Office and a commander at theWashingtonNavy Yard.The money was authorized by the Appropriations Committee, who allocated it totheDepartment of Defense as a Top Secret item in the Army construction program. TheArmy, however, could not spend it and in fact did not even know what it was for.Authorization to spend the money was in reality given to the Navy. The money waschanneled to the Chesapeake Division of the Navy Engineers, who did not knowwhat itwas for, either.Not even the commanding officer, who was an admiral, knew what the fund was tobeused for. Only one man, a Navy commander who was assigned to the ChesapeakeDivision but in reality was responsible only to the Military Office of the WhiteHouse, knewof the actual purpose, amount, and ultimate destination of the Top Secret money.The total secrecy surrounding the fund meant that almost every trace of it couldbemade to disappear by the very few people who controlled it. There has never beenand most likely never wil be an audit of this secret money.Large amounts of money were transferred from the Top Secret fund to a locationatPalm Beach, Florida, that belongs to the Coast Guard called Peanut Island.The island is adjacent to property which was owned by Joseph Kennedy. The moneywas said to have been used for landscaping and general beautification. Some timeago a TV news special on the Kennedy assassination told of a Coast Guard officertransferring money in a briefcase to a Kennedy employee across this propertyline.Could this have been a secret payment to the Kennedy family for the loss oftheir sonJohn F. Kennedy?The payments continued through the year 1967 and then stopped. The total amounttransferred is unknown and the actual use of the money is unknown.Meanwhile, Nelson Rockefeller changed positions again. This time he was to takeC. D.Jackson's old position, which had been cal ed the Special Assistant forPsychologicalStrategy. With Nelson's appointment the name was changed to the SpecialAssistant forCold War Strategy.This position would evolve over the years into the same position Henry Kissingerwasultimately to hold under President Nixon. Officially he was to give \"advice andassistance in the development of increased understanding and cooperation amongallpeoples.\" The official description was a smoke screen, for secretly he was thePresidential Coordinator for the Intel igence Community. In his new postRockefel erreported directly, and solely, to the President.74He attended meetings of the Cabinet, the Council on Foreign Economic Policy, andthe National Security Council, which was the highest policy-making body in thegovernment. Nelson Rockefeller was also given a second important job as the headofthe secret unit called the Planning Coordination Group, which was formed underNSC5412/1 in March 1955. The group consisted of different ad hoc members, dependingonthe subject on the agenda.The basic members were Rockefeller, a representative of the Department ofDefense, arepresentative of the Department of State, and the Director of Central Inteligence. Itwas soon cal ed the 5412 Committee or the Special Group.NSC 5412/1 established the rule that covert operations were subject to approvalby anexecutive committee, whereas in the past these operations were initiated solelyon theauthority of the Director of Central Intelligence.Founding of MJ-12By secret Executive Memorandum NSC 5510, Eisenhower had preceded NSC 5412/1 toestablish a permanent committee (not ad hoc) to be known as MAJESTY TWELVE (MJ-12) to oversee and conduct al covert activities concerned with the alienquestion.NSC 5412/1 was created to explain the purpose of these meetings when Congressandthe press became curious.Majesty Twelve was made up of Nelson Rockefel er, Director of CentralIntelligenceAl en Welsh Dulles, Secretary of State John Foster Dul es, Secretary of DefenseCharles E.Wilson, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Arthur W. Radford,Director of theFederal Bureau of Investigation J. Edgar Hoover, six men from the executivecommitteeof the Council on Foreign Relations known as the \"Wise Men,\" six men from theexecutive committee of the JASON Group, and Dr. Edward Teller.The JASON Group is a secret scientific group formed during the Manhattan Projectandadministered by the Mitre Corporation. The inner core of the Council on ForeignRelations recruits its members from THE SKULL & BONES and the Scroll & Keysocieties of Harvard and Yale. The Wise Men are key members of the Council onForeignRelations and also members of a secret Order of the Quest known as the JASONSociety.There were 19 members of Majesty Twelve. The first rule of Majesty Twelve wasthat noorder could be given and no action could be taken without a majority vote oftwelve infavor, thus Majority Twelve. Orders issued by Majesty Twelve became known asMajorityTwelve directives.This group was made up over the years of the top officers and directors of theCouncilon Foreign Relations and later the Trilateral Commission. Gordon Dean, GeorgeBush and Zbigniew Brzezinski were among them. The most important and influentialof75the Wise Men were John McCloy, Robert Lovett, Averel Harriman, Charles Bohlen,George Kennan, and Dean Acheson.Their policies were to last well into the decade of the '70s. It is significantthat President Eisenhower as well as the first six Majesty Twelve members fromthe Government werealso members of the Council on Foreign Relations. This gave control of the mostsecretand powerful group in government to a special-interest club that was itselfcontrol edby the Il uminati.Thorough researchers wil soon discover that not all of the Wise Men attendedHarvardor Yale and not al of them were chosen for Skull & Bones or Scroll & Keymembershipduring their col ege years.You wil be able to quickly clear up the mystery by obtaining the book The WiseMen by Walter Isaacson and Evan Thomas, Simon and Schuster, New York.Under il ustration #9 in the center of the book you wil find the caption:I have found that members were chosen on an ongoing basis by invitation baseduponmerit post-col ege and were not confined to Harvard or Yale attendees onlybecauseof this fact, a complete list of Skull & Bones members can never be compiledfrom thecatalogues or addresses of the col ege segment of the Russell Trust, also knownas theBrotherhood of Death, or the Skull & Bones.Now you know why it has been impossible to pinpoint the membership either bynumber or by name. I believe that the answer lies hidden in the CFR files, iffiles exist.A chosen few were later initiated into the secret branch of the Order of theQuestknown as the JASON Society. They are al members of the Council on ForeignRelationsand at that time were known as the Eastern Establishment. This should give you aclueto the far-reaching and serious nature of these most secret college societies.Thesociety is alive and well today, but now includes members of the TrilateralCommissionas well.The Trilateralists existed secretly before 1973. The name of the TrilateralCommission wastaken from the alien flag known as the Trilateral Insignia. Majesty Twelve wasto surviveright up to the present day. Under Eisenhower and Kennedy, it was erroneouslycal edthe 5412 Committee, or more correctly, the Special Group. In the Johnsonadministration it became the303 Committee because the name 5412 had beencompromised in the book The Secret Government.Actually, NSC 5412/1 was leaked to the author to hide the existence of NSC 5410.UnderNixon, Ford, and Carter it was called the 40 Committee, and under Reagan itbecamethe PI-40 Committee.Over al those years only the name changed.76Deception and MutilationsBy 1955 it became obvious that the aliens had deceived Eisenhower and had brokenthe treaty. Mutilated humans were being found along with mutilated animalsacross theUnited States.It was suspected that the aliens were not submitting a complete list of humancontactsand abductees to Majesty Twelve and it was suspected that not all abductees hadbeen returned. The Soviet Union was suspected of interacting with them, and thisproved to be true.The aliens stated that they had been, and were then, manipulating masses ofpeoplethrough secret societies, witchcraft, magic, the occult, and religion.You must understand that this claim could also be a manipulation. After severalAirForce combat air engagements with alien craft it also became apparent that ourweapons were no match against them.In November 1955 NSC-5412/2 was issued establishing a study committee to explore\"allfactors which are involved in the making and implementing of foreign policy inthenuclear age\".This was only a blanket of snow that covered the real subject of study, thealienquestion.The Study GroupBy secret Executive Memorandum NSC 5511 in 1954, President Eisenhower hadcommissioned the study group to \"examine all the facts, evidence, lies, anddeceptionand discover the truth of the alien question.\"NSC 5412/2 was only a cover that had become necessary when the press beganinquiring as to the purpose of regular meetings of such important men.The first meetings began in 1954 and were called the Quantico meetings becausetheymet at the Quantico Marine Base. The study group was made up solely of 35membersof the Council on Foreign Relations' secret study group. Dr. Edward Teller wasinvited toparticipate. Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski was the study director for the first 18months.Dr. Henry Kissinger was chosen as the group's study director for the second 18monthsbeginning in November 1955.Nelson Rockefel er was a frequent visitor during the study.77STUDY GROUP MEMBERSGordon Dean, ChairmanDr. Zbigniew Brzezinski, Study Director - 1st phaseDr. Henry Kissinger, Study Director - 2nd phaseDr. Edward TellerMaj.

WilsonArnold WolfersThe second-phase meetings were also held at the Marine base at Quantico,Virginia,and the group became known as Quantico II.Nelson Rockefel er built a retreat somewhere in Maryland for Majesty Twelve andthestudy committee. It could be reached only by air. In this manner they could meetawayfrom public scrutiny. This secret meeting place is known by the code name \"theCountryClub.\" Complete living, eating, recreation, library, and meeting facilitiesexist at thelocation. (The Aspen Institute is not the Country Club.)78The study group was publicly terminated in the later months of 1956. HenryKissinger wrote what was official y termed the results in 1957 as NuclearWeapons andForeign Policy, published for the Council on Foreign Relations by Harper &Brothers, NewYork. In truth, the manuscript had already been 80% written while Kissinger wasatHarvard.The study group continued, veiled in secrecy. A clue to the seriousnessKissingerattached to the study can be found in statements by his wife and friends. Manyofthem stated that Henry would leave home early each morning and return late eachnight without speaking to anyone or responding to anyone. It seemed as if hewere inanother world which held no room for outsiders.These statements are very revealing. The revelations of the alien presence andactionsduring the study must have been a great shock. Henry Kissinger was definitelyout ofcharacter during this time. He would never again be affected in this manner, nomatterthe seriousness of any subsequent event. On many occasions he would work verylateinto the night after having already put in a full day. This behavior eventuallyled todivorce.A major finding of the alien study was that the public could not be told. It wasbelievedthat this would most certainly lead to economic collapse, collapse of thereligiousstructure, and national panic, which could lead into anarchy.Secrecy thus continued. An offshoot of this finding was that if the public couldnot betold, Congress could not be told. Funding for the projects and research wouldhave tocome from outside the Government.In the meantime, money was to be obtained from the military budget and from CIAconfidential, non-appropriated funds.Genetic ExperimentationAnother major finding was that the aliens were using humans and animals for asourceof glandular secretions, enzymes, hormonal secretions, blood plasma and possiblyingenetic experiments.The aliens explained these actions as necessary to their survival. They statedthat theirgenetic structure had deteriorated and that they were no longer able toreproduce.They stated that if they were unable to improve their genetic structure, theirrace wouldsoon cease to exist.We looked upon their explanations with extreme suspicion. Since our weapons wereliteral y useless against the aliens, Majesty Twelve decided to continuefriendlydiplomatic relations until such time as we were able to develop a technologywhichwould enable us to challenge them on a military basis.79Overtures would have to be made to the Soviet Union and other nations to joinforces for the survival of humanity. In the meantime, plans were developed toresearch andconstruct two weapons systems using conventional and nuclear technology, whichwould hopeful y bring us to parity.The results of the research were Projects JOSHUA and EXCALIBUR.JOSHUA was a weapon captured from the Germans which was capable of shattering4-inch-thick armor plate at a range of two miles. It used aimed, low-frequencysoundwaves, and it was believed that this weapon would be effective against the aliencraftand beam weapons.EXCALIBUR was a weapon carried by missile not to rise above 30,000 feet aboveground level (AGL), not to deviate from designated target more than 50 meters,able towould penetrate \"1,000 meters of tufa, hard-packed soil such as that found inNewMexico,\" carry a one-megaton warhead, and intended for use in destroying thealiensin their underground bases.JOSHUA was developed successfully but never used, to my knowledge. EXCALIBUR wasnot pushed until recent years and now, we are told, there is an unprecedentedeffort todevelop this weapon.The public would be told that EXCALIBUR would be needed to take out Sovietunderground command posts. We know that is not true because one rule of war isthatyou try not to destroy the leaders. They are needed either to unconditional ysurrenderor to negotiate terms. Leaders are also needed to ensure peaceful transition ofpowerand the compliance of the populace to all negotiated or dictated terms.The events at Fatima in the early part of the century were scrutinized. On thesuspicionthat it was alien manipulation, an intel igence operation was put into motion topenetrate the secrecy surrounding the event. The United States utilized itsVaticanmoles and soon obtained the entire Vatican study, which included the prophecy.This prophecy stated that if man did not turn from evil and place himself at thefeet ofChrist the planet would self-destruct and the events described in the book ofRevelations would indeed come to pass.The prophecy demanded that Russia be consecrated to the Sacred Heart. It statedthat a child would be born who would unite the world with a plan for world peaceanda false religion. The people would discern that he was evil and was indeed theAnti-Christ. World War III would begin in the Middle East with an invasion of Israelby a UnitedArab nation using conventional weapons, which would culminate in a nuclearholocaust. Most of the life on this planet would suffer horribly and die as aresult. Thereturn of Christ would occur shortly thereafter.80When the aliens were confronted with this finding they confirmed that it wastrue. The aliens explained that they had created us through genetic manipulationin alaboratory. They stated that they had manipulated the human race throughreligion,satanism, witchcraft, magic, and the occult.They further explained that they were capable of time travel, and the eventswouldindeed come to pass if the conditions were not met. Later exploitation of alientechnology by the United States and the Soviet Union, utilizing time travel in aprojectnamed RAINBOW, confirmed the prophecy. The aliens showed a hologram, which theyclaimed was the actual crucifixion of Christ. The Government filmed thehologram.We did not know whether to believe them. Were they using our GENUINE religionstomanipulate us? Or were they indeed the source of our religions with which theyhadbeen manipulating us all along? Or was this the beginning scenario of thegenuine ENDTIMES and the RETURN OF CHRIST which had been predicted in the Bible? I DO NOTKNOW THE ANSWER.A symposium was held in 1957 which was attended by some of the great scientificminds then living. They reached the conclusion that by, or shortly after, theyear 2000the planet WOULD self-destruct due to increased population and man'sexploitation ofthe environment WITHOUT ANY HELP FROM GOD OR THE ALIENS.The REAL Space ProgramThe \"Official\" space program was boosted by President Kennedy in his inauguraladdress when he mandated that the United States put a man on the Moon before theend of the decade.Although innocent in its conception, this mandate enabled those in charge tofunnelvast amounts of money into black projects and conceal the REAL space programfromthe American people.A similar program in the Soviet Union served the same purpose. In fact, a jointalien,United States, and Soviet Union base existed on the Moon at the very momentKennedyspoke the words.On May 22,1962, a space probe landed on Mars and confirmed the existence of anenvironment which could support life. Not long afterward the construction of acolonyon the planet Mars began in earnest. Today I believe a colony exists on Marspopulatedby special y selected people from different cultures and occupations taken fromalover the Earth.A public charade of antagonism between the Soviet Union and the United Stateshasbeen maintained over all these years in order to fund projects in the name ofnationaldefense when in fact we are the closest al ies.81Kennedy AssassinationAt some point President Kennedy discovered portions of the truth concerning thedrugsand the aliens. He issued an ultimatum in 1963 to Majesty Twelve. PresidentKennedyassured them that if they did not clean up the drug problem, he would.He informed Majesty Twelve that he intended to reveal the presence of aliens totheAmerican people within the following year, and ordered a plan developed toimplement his decision, President Kennedy was not a member of the Council onForeign Relations and knew nothing of Alternative 2 or Alternative 3. (Althoughsomeresearchers claim JFK was a member of the CFR, I can find no legitimate listwith hisname upon it.)Internationally, the operations were supervised by the Bilderberg elitecommittee knownas the Policy Committee. In the United States they were supervised by theexecutivecommittee of the CFR and in the Soviet Union by its sister organization.PresidentKennedy's decision struck fear into the hearts of those in charge.In December 19881 had a phone conversation during which I told John Lear what Ihadseen in the Navy concerning the Kennedy assassination. I told him that the TopSecretdocuments stated that the act was plainly visible in a film withheld from thepublic. Itold John that I had been looking for a film that showed Greer shoot JFK for 16years buthad not found one. I was shocked and very pleasantly surprised when John askedme,\"Would you like to see it?\"The film is titled Dallas Revisited, John told me that he obtained it from a CIAacquaintance whom he was not at liberty to name. I later found out theoriginator ofthat version of the Zapruder film was Lars Hansson.Alien SpacecraftSince our interaction with the aliens began we have come into possession oftechnology beyond our wildest dreams.We currently have, and fly, atomic-powered antigravity-type craft in Nevada. Ourpilotshave made interplanetary voyages in these craft and have been to the Moon, Mars,and other planets. We have been lied to about the true nature of the Moon, theplanets Mars and Venus, and the real state of technology that we possess today,at thisvery moment.During the United States' initial space exploration and the Moon landings everylaunchwas accompanied by alien craft.On November 20, 1990, Los Angeles TV Channel 2 announced that a separate, red,glowing, round-shaped object accompanied the space shuttle Atlantis on itslatestclassified military mission. That was the first public admission.82A Moon base, Luna, was photographed by the Lunar Orbiter and filmed by theApollo astronauts. Domes, spires, tall round structures which look like silos,huge T-shapedmining vehicles that left stitch-like tracks in the lunar surface, and extremelylarge aswell as smal alien craft appear in the official NASA photographs. It is a jointUnitedStates and Soviet base: The space program is a farce and an unbelievable wasteofmoney. Alternative 3 is a reality. It is not science fiction.The Apollo astronauts were severely shaken by this experience, and their livesandsubsequent statements reflect the depth of the revelation and the effect of themuzzleorder which fol owed.There are areas on the Moon where plant life grows and even changes color withtheseasons. This seasonal effect is because the Moon does not, as claimed, alwayspresentthe exact same side to the Earth or the Sun.The Moon has several man-made lakes and ponds upon its surface, and clouds havebeen observed and filmed in its atmosphere. It possesses a gravitational field -and mancan walk upon its surface without a space suit, breathing from an oxygen bottleafterundergoing decompression, the same as any deep-sea diver! I have the officialNASAphotographs.Some of them were published in the books We Discovered Alien Bases on theMoon by Fred Steckling and Someone Else Is on the Moon. In 1969 a confrontationbroke out between the Soviets and Americans at the lunar base. The Sovietsattemptedto take control of the base and held American scientists and personnel hostage.Wewere able to restore order but not before 66 people were kil ed.The Soviets were suspended from the program for a period of two years. Areconciliation eventual y took place and once again we began to interact. Todaythealliance continues.The Archuleta Mesa underground-base confrontation scenario is puredisinformationput out to confuse the issue. I knew that a confrontation had taken place butcould notremember the details. John Lear had convinced me that aliens and Delta forceshadfought at the Archuleta base. (The New World Order must have an enemy from outerspace.)Later, when I used regressive hypnosis to improve my memory, the true factsemerged.To my knowledge the only hostility between aliens and humans was provoked by theU.S. military when they were ordered to shoot down UFOs in order to capturetechnology.John Lear also says that we invented AIDS in order to kil blood-sucking aliensand thatwe are only containers for souls. This is hogwash! It is a clear vote for the\"aliens do not exist\" theory.83Nixon Forced To ResignWhen the Watergate scandal broke, President Nixon was confident that he couldnotbe impeached.Majesty Twelve had a different agenda. Nixon was ordered to resign, theintelligencecommunity rightful y concluding that an impeachment trial would open up thefiles andbare the secrets to the public eye. He refused.The first military coup ever to take place in the United States was carried out.The JointChiefs of Staff sent a Top Secret message to the Commanders of al the U.S. armedforces throughout the world.It stated: \"Upon receipt of this message you wil no longer carry out any ordersfrom the White House. Acknowledge receipt.\"This message was sent a full five days before Nixon conceded and announcedpubliclythat he would resign.I saw the message. When I asked my commanding officer what he would do, asobviously the order violated the Constitution, I was told: \"I guess I wil waitto see if any orders come from the White House, and then I wil decide” I did notsee anycommunication from the White House but that does not mean that none was sent.I have confirmation from three additional sources, all ex-military, who wrote orcal ed tostate that they saw the exact same order. These people are Randall Terpstra,ex-Navy;David Race, ex-Air Force; and Donald Campbel , ex-Navy. The transcript of atapedphone conversation between the author and Mr. Terpstra is presented as Chapter11 ofthis book, and the signed statements of the others can be found in the Appendix.During all the years that this has been happening the Congress and the Americanpeople have seemed to know instinctively that something was not right. When theWatergate scandal surfaced they jumped on the band-wagon and everyone thoughtthat the agencies would be cleaned out. President Ford organized the Rockefel erCommission to do the job. His real purpose was to head off Congress and keep thecover-up going.Nelson Rockefel er, who headed the commission investigating the intelligencecommunity, was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the one whohelped Eisenhower build the Majesty Twelve power structure. Rockefelleruncoveredonly enough to keep the hounds at bay. He threw the Congress a few bones and thecover-up rol ed merrily along as always.Later Senator Church would conduct the famous Church hearings. He also was aprominent member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and he merely repeated theRockefel er act. Again the cover-up prevailed. When the Iran-Contra affairemerged,we thought this time it had to come gushing out. Wrong again. Despite mountainsof84documents pointing to drug smuggling and other hidden monsters, the cover-upsailed on. The Congress even seemed to go out of its way to duck the realissues.As mentioned earlier, one of the most serious facts uncovered is that North wasinvolvedin preparing a plan to suspend the Constitution of the United States of America.WhenCongressman Jack Brooks of Texas attempted to probe the issue he was silenced bythe committee chairman. Could it be that Congress knows the whole thing andwon'ttouch it?Are they among the select who have been picked for the Mars colony when theEarthbegins to destruct, if the Earth is going to destruct?I cannot even begin to outline the entire financial empire control ed by theCIA, theNSA, and the Council on Foreign Relations, which in turn control and launder themoney from drugs and other intel igence community proprietary ventures; but Icangive you a beginning.Contingency PlanA contingency plan was formulated by Majesty Twelve to throw every one off thetrailshould they come close to the truth.The plan was known as MAJESTIC TWELVE. It was implemented with the release byMoore, Shandera, and Friedman of the purported Eisenhower Briefing Document.The document is a fraud, because it is numbered 092447, a number which does notexist and wil not exist for quite a long time at the present rate. Truman wroteExecutiveorders in the 9000 range; Eisenhower's were in the 10,000 range; Ford was up tothe11,000 bracket; and Reagan reached only into the 12,000s.Executive orders are numbered consecutively, no matter who occupies the WhiteHouse, for reasons of continuity, record keeping, and to prevent confusion. Thisredherring has thrown the entire research community off the trail for several yearsand hasresulted in the wasted expenditure of money looking for information which doesnotexist.The Washington D.C.-based Fund for UFO Research headed by Bruce Maccabee hascommitted what I believe to be criminal fraud in connection with the EisenhowerBriefing Document, Stanton Friedman, and the re- search team of Moore, Shandera,and Friedman.Maccabee solicited funds from people, promising to use those funds toinvestigateMoore's, Shandera's, and Friedman's claims and prove the Eisenhower BriefingDocument to be genuine or fake. Instead he gave the entire $16,000 to StantonFriedman and assigned HIM the task of establishing or destroying his ownvalidity. Whata snow job!85People in the UFO community fel for the scam and eagerly awaited StantonFriedman'sfindings. Of course, Friedman found that the documents were genuine.Another plan is in force. It is the plan to prepare the public for eventualconfrontationwith an alien race. It could also intend to make you believe in an alien racethat maynot exist. The public is being bombarded with movies, radio, advertising, and TVprograms depicting almost every aspect of the purported true nature of an alienpresence.This includes the good and the bad. Look around and pay attention. Someone isplanning to make their presence known and the government is preparing you forit.They do not want any panic. The unprecedented number of sightings worldwideindicates that public exposure is not far off. Never in history have there beenso manyincidents involving UFOs and never in history have there been so many officialacknowledgments.For many years the Secret Government has been importing drugs and sel ing themtothe people, mainly the poor and minorities. Social welfare programs were putintoplace to create a dependent, nonworking element in our society.The government then began to remove these programs to force people into acriminalclass that did not exist in the '50s and '60s.The middle class is begging the government to do away with the 2nd amendment.Author's Note: I have found that these events have indeed happened all over thecountry. In every instance that I have investigated - the shooters were allex-mentalpatients or were current mental patients who were ALL ON THE DRUG PROZAC!This drug, when taken in certain doses, increases the serotonin level in thepatient,causing extreme violence. Couple that with a posthypnotic suggestion or controlthrough an electronic brain implant or microwave or E.L.F. intrusion and you getmassmurder, ending in every case with the suicide of the perpetrator.Secret Government AgentsPhilip Klass is an agent of the CIA. This was stated in the documents I sawbetween 1970and 1973. One of his jobs as an aviation expert was to debunk everything to dowithUFOs. Al military commanders were instructed to call him to gain information onhow todebunk and/or explain UFO contacts and/or sightings to the public and/or thepress ifand when the need arose. Some people seem to love Klass.86They encourage him and heap large doses of attention upon him. He is invited tospeak at UFO events and is quoted in papers, books, and newspapers as being theexpert on\"what real y happened.\"Philip Klass is not operating in our best interest. His debunkings andexplanations of UFOsightings are so full of holes that a six-year-old child should be able todiscern his truepurpose. I have seen poor misled people actually ask Klass for his autograph, anactsimilar in magnitude to El iot Ness asking Al Capone for his autograph.I have found that in many instances the secret elect are absolutely right whentheystate that \"people who wil not use their intelligence are no better than animalswho donot have intel igence. Such people are beasts of burden and steaks on the tablebychoice and consent.\" (Quote from \"Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars\" in ChapterTwo). We get exactly what we deserve in most instances.Wil iam Moore, Jaimie Shandera, and Stanton Friedman are witting (with fullknowledge,understanding, and consent) agents of the Secret Government. Wil iam Moore'sreported use of a Defense Investigative Service ID card and his reportedself-confessionto Lee Graham that he is an agent of the government confirmed it. (Lee Grahamphoned me at my home, and when asked, confirmed that Moore had indeed shownhim a Defense Investigative Service ID.)Moore's later confession proved it with- out any doubt. Author's Note: On July1,1989,the night before I presented this paper at the MUFON symposium in Las Vegas, WiliamMoore admitted that he was a government agent, that he had releaseddisinformationto researchers, that had falsified documents, that he had spied upon researchersandreported information concerning those researchers to the intel igence community,thathe had helped in a counterintel igence operation against Paul Bennewicz thatresultedin Mr. Bennewicz's commitment to a mental institution, and that he had done althiswith full knowledge of what he was doing.He is either a traitor or a stone-hearted manipulator at best. Some of theself-appointed\"UFOlogists\" stil look up to Moore, and stil cite his research in theircorrespondence, papers, and books.I later found out by body-proportion comparison analysis and voice-printanalysis thatJohn Lear is the agent dubbed \"Condor\" on the CIA-backed TV production of \"UFOCover-up Live.\" As Condor, he is in reality a government agent who has beenworkingwith Moore, Shandera, Friedman, John Grace, Bob Lazar, and others all along.They areCIA all the way.Stanton Friedman has told me and others that years ago he \"helped develop anuclearreactor to power an aircraft that was the size of a basketbal , was clean,turned outhydrogen, and worked like a dream\" (his words, not mine). Several others havewrittenme to say that they also were told the same thing by Mr. Friedman. RogerScherrer isone who remembers Stanton relating to him this same story.87The only fuel which could go into such an engine and produce hydrogen as abyproduct is water, and that is precisely what at least one type of alien craftuses -nuclear energy and water, according to the documentation I read while in NavalIntelligence. Is he really unwitting? I seriously doubt it. He was a member ofthe Moore,Shandera, and Friedman research team, and it was they who implemented theMAJESTIC TWELVE contingency plan.There was a two-word code that these people were to use to identify each other.Thefirst word was a color and the second word was a bird.The code was \"Gold Eagle.\" When Stanton Friedman first contacted me he used thecode. I pretended ignorance but he asked me several times if I had ever seen orheardof Gold Eagle. John Lear also asked me if I had ever heard of Gold Eagle. He toowastesting me. They knew that I had access to correct information and wereattempting todetermine if I were one of them. As George Bush would say, \"Read my lips.\"I was never one of you. I wil never be one of you.I have discovered that Whitley Strieber is a CIA asset, as is Budd Hopkins.Strieber's bookMajestic has convicted him with those of us in the know. It is the true story ofthe Roswelcrash taken from the confiscated diaries of James Forrestal. That is, assumingthat thedocuments that I saw in the Navy were not a hoax. I do not believe that theywere.The names of people and names of projects and operations have been changed inStrieber's book, but other than that the information and documentation is true.Theautopsy reports are exactly the same that I saw in Project GRUDGE 18 years ago.I have recently come into possession of an affidavit that is signed, notarized,and swornunder penalty of perjury from an M.D. in New York stating that the M.D. wasrecruitedby a CIA agent named Budd Hopkins to help work with abductees for the CIA. Theaffidavit is included in the Appendix.I knew that Hopkins was not right when I met him in Modesto. He could not lookme inthe eyes, and anyone who cannot look me in the eyes is not right. He spent thewholetime, including his speech, trying to convince people of the innocence of theabductee experience and the absence of the aliens' malevolence, which was atotalcrock. It was an insult to anyone who had investigated abductees.I know that all of the major UFO research organizations were targeted forinfiltration andcontrol by the Secret Government, just as NICAP was infiltrated and control ed.In fact,NICAP was eventual y destroyed from within. I know that these efforts have beensuccessful.MUFON is a great example. Hundreds of members all over the world conductinvestigations and send in physical evidence to MUFON headquarters, where itquicklydisappears. Everyone screams for physical evidence as proof. Recently sampleswere88collected of a liquid that had dripped from a saucer onto a schoolyard in GulfBreeze, Florida. The samples were sent to MUFON, where they immediatelyvanished.Walt Andrus has stated that it was an accident. BALONEY! This is not the firsttimeMUFON has \"lost\" evidence. I consider MUFON the great black hole of the UFOcommunity. The control of information is so tight that nothing escapes. Anyonewho tellsit like it real y is, is debunked and barred from symposiums. The members aretold whatto believe and what not to believe. The members do not seem to know that theyarebeing controlled.The members of the MUFON board of directors and the members of the advisoryboardof consultants are for the most part supported by the Government in the form ofsalaries, grants, or retirement checks.Who can believe that this does not constitute a conflict of interest? Who caninvestigate and expose the hand that feeds them? How can you possibly believetheGovernment could not control the people to whom it funnels money? MONEY IS THEBASIC METHOD OF CONTROL.The major UFO publications are without any doubt control ed and are mostprobably,as in the case with UFO, financially backed or control ed by the CIA. VickiCooper (norelation), the editor and publisher of UFO, has been tel ing friends andrelatives for atleast two years that the CIA is pushing her magazine. Ron Regehr and Lee Grahamremember the summer of 1988 when Vicki interviewed them at Mr. Graham'sresidencein Huntington Beach.You must understand that the government is not ever going to allow any person oranygroup of persons to uncover the most highly classified secret in the world - ifthey canhelp it. They wil always have agents controlling UFO groups, publications andinformation. If aliens are not real and the whole thing turns out to be thegreatest hoaxever perpetrated, just who do you think did the perpetrating?If the underground history is correct, aliens have manipulated and/or ruled thehumanrace through various secret societies, religions, magic, witchcraft, and theoccult.The Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission are in completecontrolof the alien technology and are also in complete control of the nation'seconomy.Eisenhower was the last President to know the entire overview of the alienproblem.Succeeding Presidents were told only what Majesty Twelve and the intelligencecommunity wanted them to know.Believe me, it was not the truth.Majesty Twelve has presented most new Presidents with a picture of a lost aliencultureseeking to renew itself, build a home on this planet, and shower us with giftsoftechnology. In some cases, the President was told nothing. Each President inturn hasswallowed the story (or no story at all)89hook, line and sinker. Meanwhile innocent people continue to suffer at the handsof the alien and human scientists. I have been unable to determine exactly whatit is they aredoing. Many people are abducted and are sentenced to live with psychological andphysical damage for the rest of their lives. Could this really be a CIAmind-controloperation?In the documents that I read, 1 in 40 humans had been implanted with devices,thepurpose of which I have never discovered. The Government believes that thealiens arebuilding an army of implanted humans who can be activated and turned upon us atwil . You should also know that to date we have not even begun to come close toparity with the aliens.Majestic 12 TodayToday, MJ-12 stil exists and operates just as it always has.It is made up of the same structure, 6 from the same positions in government,and 6from the executive members of the Council on Foreign Relations and/or TrilateralCommission. The Majority Agency for Joint Intelligence is publicly known as theSeniorInteragency Group (SIG).In closing it is most important to understand that the council on ForeignRelations and itsoffshoot the Trilateral Commission not only control but own this country. LongbeforeWWII they were instrumental in helping to decide policy for the United StatesGovernment. The Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission and theirforeigncounterparts report to Bilderbergers.Almost every high level government and military official of any consequencesinceWWII including presidents have been members of the Council on Foreign Relationsand/or Trilateral Commission. Al American members of the Trilateral Commissionhaveeither been or are a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.Each foreign nation of any importance has its own offshoot of the Council onForeignRelations and the members of each country interact with those of other countriesthrough the Bilderbergers’ to further their common goals. The foreign member oftheTrilateral Commission belong to their respective organizations.Even a cursory investigation by the most inexperienced researcher wil show thatthemembers of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commissioncontrol themajor foundations, all of the major media, publishing interests, the largestbanks, all themajor corporations, the upper echelons of the government, and many other vitalinterests.90Their members are elected and appointed because they have al the money andspecial interests behind them. Al , that is, except the peoples. They areundemocraticand do not in any way represent the majority of the U.S. of America.These are the people who wil decide who survives the coming holocaust and whodoes not.The Bilderbergers, the Council on Foreign Relations and the TrilateralCommission arethe SECRET GOVERNMENT and rule this nation through MJ-12 and the study groupknown as the Jason Society or Jason Scholars and the top echelon of thegovernmentwhich consist mostly of their members.Alien ManipulationThroughout our history the Aliens have manipulated and/or ruled the humanrace through various secret societies, religion, magic, witchcraft, and theoccult.The Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission are in completecontrolof the alien technology and are also in complete control of the nation'seconomy.Eisenhower was the last president to know the entire overview of the alienproblem.Succeeding presidents were told only what MJ-12 and the Intel igence Communitywanted them to know and believe me, it wasn't the truth.As if that is not enough many people end up as food for the insatiable alienappetitefor biological enzymes, glandular hormonal secretions, and blood.(1) The secret power structure may believe that by our own ignorance or bydivinedecree, planet Earth wil self-destruct sometime in the near future. These mensincerelybelieve that they are doing the right thing in their attempt to save the humanrace. It isterribly ironic that they have been forced to take as their partner an alienrace which isitself engaged in a monumental struggle for survival. Many moral and legalcompromises may have been made in this joint effort.These compromises were made in error and must be corrected. Those responsibleshould be brought to account for their actions. I can understand the fear andurgencythat must have been instrumental in the decision not to tell the public.Obviously Idisagree with that decision. Throughout history small but powerful groups of menhaveconsistently felt that they alone were capable of deciding the fates of milions.Throughout history they have been wrong.This great Nation owes its very existence to the principles of Freedom andDemocracy. Ibelieve with al my heart that the United States of America cannot and wil notsucceedin any effort that ignores those principles. Ful disclosure to the public shouldbe madeand we should proceed to save the human race together.(2) We are being manipulated by a joint human/alien power structure which wilresultin a one-world government and the partial enslavement of the human race. Thishas91been deemed necessary to solve the elemental question: \"Who wil speak for planetEarth?\"It has been decided that man is not mature enough in his evolutionarydevelopment tobe trusted to interact properly with an alien race. We already have enoughtroublebetween the different human races, so:What would happen if a totally alien extraterrestrial race was introduced?Would they be lynched, spit upon, or shot?Would discrimination result in nasty encounters that would doom humanity as aresult ofthe alien's obviously superior technology?Have our leaders decided to lock us in the playpen?The only way to prevent this scenario from taking place is to cause anevolutionary leapin consciousness, a paradigm shift for the entire human race. I have no idea howit canbe done, but I know that it desperately needs to be done. It needs to be doneveryquickly and very quietly.(3) The government has been total y deceived and we are being manipulated by analien power, which wil result in the total enslavement and/or destruction of thehumanrace. We must use any and every means available to prevent this from happening.(4) If none of the above are true, something else may be happening which isbeyondour ability to understand at this moment. We must force disclosure of all of thefacts,discover the truth, and act upon it. The situation in which we find ourselves isdue to ourown actions or inactions over the last 44 years. Because it is our own fault, weare theonly ones who can change future events. Education seems to me to be a major partofthe solution. The remaining part is the abolition of secrecy.(5) There is always the possibility that I was used, that the whole alienscenario is thegreatest hoax in history designed to create an alien enemy from outer space inorder toexpedite the formation of a one-world government. I have found evidence thatthiscould be true. I have included that evidence in the Appendix. I advise you toconsiderthis scenario as being probable.Through ignorance or misplaced trust, we as a people have abdicated our role asthewatchdog of our government.Our government was founded \"of the people, for the people, by the people.\" Therewas no mention or intent ever to abdicate our role and place our total trust ina handful ofmen who meet secretly to decide our fate.In fact, the structure of our government was designed to prevent that from everhappening. It we had done our jobs as Citizens we would never have reached thispoint Most of us are completely ignorant as to even the most basic functions ofour92government. We have truly become a nation of sheep - and sheep are alwayseventually led to slaughter.It is time to stand up in the manner of our forefathers and walk like men. Iremind youthat the Jews of Europe marched obediently to the ovens after having beenwarned,believing all the while that the facts could not possibly be true. When theoutside worldwas told of the holocaust occurring in Hitler's Europe, it was not believed atfirst.You must understand that, real or not, the purported presence of aliens havebeenused to neutralize certain widely different segments of the population:\"Don't worry, the benevolent space brothers wil save you.\"It can also be used to fil the need for an extraterrestrial threat to justifythe formation of a New World Order:\"The aliens are eating us.\"The most important information that you need to determine your future actions isthatthis New World Order calls for the destruction of the sovereignty of nations,including theUnited States.The New World Order cannot, and wil not, allow our Constitution to continue toexist.The New World Order wil be a totalitarian socialist system. We wil be slavesshackled toa cashless system of economic control. If the documentation that I viewed whileI wasin Naval Intel igence is true, then what you have just read is probably closerto the truththan anything ever written. If extraterrestrials are a hoax, then what you justread isexactly what the Il uminati wants you to believe.I can assure you beyond any shadow of a doubt that even if aliens are not real,thetechnology IS REAL. Antigravity craft exist and human pilots fly them. I and milions ofothers have seen them.They are metal; they are machines; they come in different shapes and sizes; andtheyare obviously intel igently guided.to all anti-war activists. So Cooper didn’t need to find a “Top Secret” documentto learnabout the group, and only needed to read the newspapers in the late 1960s andearly1970s when their activities were being discussed in the press.Cooper also writes about the alleged Majestic Twelve (also called MajestyTwelve), agroup some believe is a scientific branch within the military which deals withaliens.Again, Cooper claims this information was discovered from secret documents thathejust happened to find. He wrote, “I read Top Secret documents while with NavalIntelligence that stated President Eisenhower had appointed six of the ExecutiveCommittee members of the CFR [Council on Foreign Relations] to sit on the panelcal ed Majesty Twelve also known as Majority Twelve for security reasons.Majesty93[index-94_1.png][index-94_2.png][index-94_3.png][index-94_4.png]Twelve is the secret group that is supposed to control extraterrestrialinformation andprojects.Ideas surrounding Majestic Twelve had been circulating in UFO circles since1984, andwas not a new “discovery” by Cooper from “Top Secret” documents. Most in the UFOcommunity did not take Cooper seriously, and he found the majority of hissupport frompatriots and those against the New World Order.Cooper claimed that he possessed photographs of a secret base located on themoonin the crater Copernicus. Also in Behold a Pale Horse he included pictures ofwhat hesaid were UFOs and diagrams and photos of what he cal ed alien reproductionvehicles.The Sysop (system operator) for ParaNet, Michael Corbin, had this to say aboutCooper:“First, I don’t want to get into any protracted discussions about Bill Cooper.Al I can sayis that we, ParaNet, had a great deal of experience with Bill Cooper, up to andincluding ejecting him from the net for causing a variety of disruptions, not tomentionstrong attacks on other members of the net that were counter-productive to inteligentdiscussion.“Our organization has investigated Cooper to the max and can find no truth inanything he says except that he was in the Navy, but not in the capacity that heclaims. The bottom line is that Bill Cooper just doesn’t hold water, so anythinghe saysshould be taken with a large block of salt and tongue planted firmly in cheek.”Criticizing Cooper is a sensitive issue since he is viewed as a martyr by manyof his fanswho are offended by anyone voicing doubts about his claims or credentials, andcontinue to believe that he was assassinated despite al the evidence to thecontrary.On November 5th of 2001, Wil iam Cooper, former US Naval Intelligence Officer,theauthor of \"Behold a Pale Horse\", and a well-respected researcher, was shot deadby a police officer outside his home in Arizona. Of course, when something likethis happensto someone as heavily involved in conspiracy theories as Bill Cooper was, thegovernment is quick to be blamed. While some may say it was obviously anassassination, a hit job to get rid of this \"annoying person,\" from what I’veseen of the evidence, we should avoid jumping to conclusions.Sure, Bil was a giant thorn in the side of the Government. From the military,FBI, CIA andto the then President. Bill Clinton, but I believe that what he had revealedabout aliensand government conspiracies he learned about while in Naval Intelligence wasalready94revealed to the public and any actions to silence him would have beenimplemented much earlier.(Although he claimed that there were at least two attempts on his life when hewasforced off the road by a black limo and in the first attempt they checked tomake surehe was close enough to death, and in the second, where he lost his leg and wasvisitedin the hospital and threatened to keep his mouth shut.) I have no doubt thatBill wastelling the truth about this, and I have no reason to give any credence to somewhoclaim that these accidents were caused solely by his heavy drinking.There was plenty of reason for the Government to want to silence him in thelater yearsbecause of his stirring up trouble with his radio broadcasts, and blaming theGovernment for such things as the Oklahoma City Bombing as wel as encouraginganti-government groups. (President Clinton called him “The most dangerous man onthe radio.”)The Government may have been holding back because of Bil ’s popularity, as wellasnot wanting another “Ruby Ridge” and taking the slow, quiet route through thecourtswhere they had at least one lawsuit against him in the works.While the government appeared to be holding back, the local authorities, whowerealso holding back on serving a warrant for not appearing in court, had theirhandsforced by what they claimed to be gun threats against some neighbors. While thisappeared to be an action taken by solely local authorities, documents uncoveredshowed that help, such as electronic surveil ance, was provided by the FBI. Andthismay have been normal in such a high profile case where the Government also hadaninterest in keeping down the bloodshed on both sides. Anyway, it was claimedthat thefirst shot was fired by Bill Cooper.Bil Cooper lost the last battle, but his friends and fans are numerous!It was claimed that Wil iam Cooper was a very angry man. Those who correspondedwith him claimed he was hard to reason with. Most likely his anger wasjustified; he feltextremely betrayed by the government he once served for many years, with theintention to protect the country he loved. And became angry when he found outwhatwas going on behind all our backs.Due to his serious involvement in the anti-Il uminati movement, and uncoveringwhat hefelt was the Governments betrayal of its citizens, he had to send his family toEurope,\"for their own protection\", as he put it. Therefore, he lived his last years byhimself, together with his dog, Crusher, in his house in Arizona, and diedalone, without hisfamily.95From the Sierra Times 11.06.01Details are stil sketchy on what caused the Cooper shootout on November 5, 2001,buta fax sent from the Apache County Sheriff's office sheds some more light on thesubject.Wil iam Cooper was fatally wounded during a late night gunfight. Contrary towhat wasreported earlier, it was not a SWAT raid, but a simple confrontation betweenpolice andCooper. One Apache County deputy, Robert Martinez was critically wounded in theexchange. Here's what we know so far: According to the Sheriff's report, severaldeputies were positioned outside the Cooper residence to serve a warrantfor Aggravated Assault and two counts of endangerment.Cooper had stated numerous times in the past that he would not surrender to lawenforcement via his website and shortwave radio. Obviously, law enforcement tookhimseriously. The showdown began at approximately 12:15 pm local time.After leaving his residence in his vehicle, the report states that Cooperconfronted plainclothed deputies a short distance away. \"As Cooper drove back to his residence,deputies attempted to stop him using a ful y marked patrol vehicle to block thedriveway.Cooper refused to stop or comply with verbal orders by the deputies\", accordingto thereport. Cooper then drove around the patrol car to evade the arrest, and thereportstated that he tried to run over one of the deputies enroute back to hisresidence.Cooper was then fol owed a short distance to his residence where this time hewas confronted by uniformed deputies. \"After refusing once again to comply withthedeputies’ orders, Cooper exited his vehicle and began running toward the house,firingshots with a handgun toward the deputies\", the report said.Nowhere in the report did it mention that Cooper only had one leg - the otherlost incombat long ago.Cooper died on the scene. When Deputy Martinez took a head shot, officersreturnedfire, the report said. According to the Sheriff's office, \"the surgery onMartinez went well\", but the condition is stil critical. There was a positivehistory written up about Martinez in the report, but nothing positive aboutCooper, of course.Cooper had made it known that he would take action against law enforcement fromyears back stating, \"trespassers wil be shot on discovery.\" He also deniedviolating any laws during that period as well. Cooper has a history of harassingand threatening localresidents with deadly force, according to the report. He was recently chargewithaggravated assault and endangerment, as well as wanted by the U.S. Marshal 'sService on unrelated felony charges. Cooper had spent the last month chal engingthegovernment's claims about what caused the destruction of the World Trade CenteronSeptember 11.96[index-97_1.jpg]Most who knew of Cooper al state that he was a hard man to get along with - ifat all.His demeanor and attitude was \"unfriendly\" at best. Although state-sponsoredmediacal ed Cooper a \"national militia leader\", no one has yet to come forward whowasunder his command, nor has anyone to this point come forward to claim his'militiarank'.None of those who knew Cooper and spoke to Sierra Times wanted to go on therecord, but the best statement was, \"he was a son-of a bitch, but he was ourson-of-abitch\". The new Patriot Act of 2001 has many wondering if the Cooper take downwasjust the beginning in silencing the voices on opposition in the Country. \"Arethey juststarting in alphabetical order?\" one person asked.Cooper was best known for being the first to provide evidence of explosivesbeingfound inside the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995, includingthe typeof explosive used.According to his webmaster, \"It appears at this time to be totally unrelated tothedisputes he had with the federal government.\" There were no federal agentsinvolvedwith the gunfight.97[index-98_1.png][index-98_2.png][index-98_3.png][index-98_4.png][index-98_5.jpg]Released under the Freedom of Information Act.
