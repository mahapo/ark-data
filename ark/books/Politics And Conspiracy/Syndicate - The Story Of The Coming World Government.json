There are powers at work in this count ry about which we have no knowledge.\" Misreporting? Or is sh e wrong? Or could it be true? The theme of this book is that it is. The history and current affairs we are taught in sc hools, read in the newspapers, and read in books, tends to focus on pu blic figures - kings, prime ministers, nations. It highlights the events that are most visible. But there are currents that determine these events, and figures hidden from the public eye that move them. It can be hard to di scern these figures, and the sequence of events can be hard to unravel. It's hard enough to unravel the events in front of our noses. Did Iraq for instance have weapons of mass destruction or not? Y ou might think that with all the modern technology at the disposal of W estern governments, down to satellites that can spot cigarette packets, there could be little room for doubt. If our governments can get it so wr ong, what chance do we have? Who can we trust? What can we believe? It' s easy to lose our bearings and believe any conspiracy theory. The opp osite is equally true: it's easy to believe what the government says, that everything is open and above board. I believe the answer is to look at the broader picture, to look at patterns over decades rather than at single even ts. Many of the conclusions here are tentative. They ma y sound impossible. But then many things do without the benefit of hind sight. Who would have guessed in 1930 that the following decade woul d see the attempt to create a New World Order involving the exterminatio n of most of Europe's Jews and the overall deaths of 70 million?

Who is really behind this terror? How has it suddenly appe ared, with such vigor and success, seemingly from nowhere? There is a pattern behind recent events, which I at tempt to uncover. The overall explanation is that these events are no t random, not driven by individual acts of evil. They are the result of a g radual, inexorable drive on the behalf of certain parties to a world government . The dreams of past empires are not dead, but very much alive. The driv e to world government is not a past fad, limited only by the lack of know ledge of how big the world is and the ability to get around it all, but present today. It is not the fantasy of alien cultures, of fundamentalists o f different hues, but has been slipped into our own democracies by people and organizations we've never really understood were in our midst. These dreams have driven the creation of the United States as well as the European Empires. They are behind the push to a united Europe, and many of the recent events in the Middle East. They will be realized, if we let it happen, in a United States of the World, a world government. With modern communications, in a small planet, this is inevitable. The question is whether this world government is going to work for the good of everyone, coming from a universalist, global dem ocratic perspective, or whether it's going to be run in the interests of the few. This is the key question we face over the coming decades. In covering so much ground in one book I realize it often makes assumptions and judgments that may seem questionabl e, particularly in the case of recent events. As in any court of law, some of the evidence for the Syndicate and its actions will be less than sat isfactory - circumstantial, hearsay, and inadmissible. But a judgment has to be made. Otherwise the twenty-first century could prove even more viol ent than the twentieth. Wisdom with hindsight is easy, but too late for man y. I leave it to you to decide."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"1 THE QUESTION There is no proletarian, not even a Communist movem ent that has not operated in the interests of money, in the direction indicated by money, and for the time being permitte d by money - and that without the idealists among its leaders having the slightest suspicion of the fact. Oswald Spengler, Decline of the West In the West most people, even if they don't trust t heir politicians, see their system of government as essentially benign, w orking for the good of the nation, being firm and fair in its dealings with the world beyond its borders, offering peace and cooperation and only go ing to war if absolutely forced to. In the developing countries, particularl y Moslem ones, that great spread from the Atlantic to the Pacific cover ing most of the ancient civilizations, people see the West differently. As devious and aggressive, if not outright evil. I recognize their point of view. I think it has mor e accuracy than most Westerners realize. It may be because I find it eas ier to see the world through non-Western eyes than most academic histori ans. In 1966 I was among the first Westerners to witness the Chinese C ultural Revolution. In 1969 I was driving across Tripoli on the morning of the Libyan Revolution. I've lectured at the University of Baghdad and was Professor of English for four years at three universities in Tokyo, Japan. So in these chapters I approach twentieth-century h istory in a manner that will be unfamiliar to most readers. They descr ibe the dominant themes that determined the major events as money an d oil rather than random assassination or government cock-up. Railroa d and oil magnates are more significant than Lloyd George or the Kaise r. 1"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"2 The Syndicate The events of the last couple of years have brought increasing numbers around to this way of thinking. The pace of events is accelerating. The lies seem to get bigger, and the events seem more inexpl icable. It's why we're increasingly suspicious of politicians. Why we susp ect that they're not really working with our best interests at heart. Wh y we're more reluctant to go to war. They have to persuade us harder. They invent stories, or turn a deaf ear to the ones they don't want us to hear. Here's why. I'll come straight to the point, offering four comm ents. The first is that the world is running out of oil. Virtually all commentators agree there are 50 to 100 years of supplies left, o verall, assuming current rates of production and consumption continue and ne wly industrializing and populous countries like China don't rapidly inc rease their demand (which seems inevitable). 1 (Production for 1998. Reserves as at January 1,1999 ) The second is that the reserves are distributed as follows: 2 "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The Question 3 Both the USA and UK have around 5 years' oil supply left, or less. Their increasing reliance on imports is having a serious effect on the balance of payments. As a reflection of the UK's oil trade def icit, the UK's balance of payments is currently running at over £40b p.a. Harold Macmillan's Conservative government was thrown out of office in 1964 for having a balance of payments deficit of well under £1b. The US balance of payments in 2003 was running at a £542b deficit. 3 The third is that oil and politics are increasingly intermingled. It's particularly apparent in the present US government. Vice-President Dick Cheney previously served as chairman and chief exec utive of Halliburton Co., the world's largest oilfield services company, which had operations in Azerbaijan. Cheney and Donald Evans, Commerce Se cretary, both ran energy-related companies and earned millions of dollars from oil. Condoleezza Rice, national security advisor, was a director with Chevron from 1991 until January 2001 and had a company oil tanker named after her. Brent Scowcroft, advisor to Rice and national security advisor to Bush Sr., was a director of Pennzoil-Quaker State C o. and Enron Global Power & Pipelines, a unit of Enron Corp. Christine Todd Whitman, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agenc y, owned interests in oil wells in Texas and Colorado. Donald Rumsfeld , Defense Secretary, had between $3.25m and $15.5m worth of investments in energy-related companies. James Baker, advisor to the Bush family and former Secretary"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"4 The Syndicate of State, had a law firm which represented several oil companies with interests in Azerbaijan, including Exxon-Mobil Corp . Richard Armitage, Deputy Secretary of State, was a co-chairman of the US-Azerbaijan Chamber of Commerce. 4 George W. Bush followed his father into the Texan o il business. He founded Bush Exploration in 1975. His Arbusto compa ny did not always strike oil, and investors lost money when a dry hol e was dug. By 1983 the oil industry was in decline and, with his father Vi ce-President of the USA, Bush sought financial help. Bill De Witt approached Bush and made him Chairman of his own successful firm, Spectrum 7 Ene rgy Corporation and gave him a salary of $75,000 p.a. and more than a m illion shares. Eighteen months later the company began to founder and in 19 86 it was taken over by Harken Energy. With his father campaigning for t he Presidency, Bush was paid a salary of $120,000 as a consultant and g iven $600,000 worth of Harken Energy shares. In 1990 Harken Energy beat its rival Amoco to land an offshore drilling deal in Bahrain. The fourth is that for the first time in our histor y we have gone to war on the basis of (apparently wrong) intelligence with a country, Iraq, who (it is now apparent) was no direct threat to the national secu rity of either the US or the UK. No troops were massing on their borders prepare d to attack the USA or cross the English Channel. No terrorists were being sent out from Baghdad to bomb New York or London. Of the 9/11 terrorists none were Iraqis. It was a poor country bled dry by sanctions, with part of its territory cordoned off by the Alliance, flown over regularly by US spy planes , and with UN inspectors crawling over the ground. But it does happen to hav e the world's longest- lasting oil reserves with 142 years' supply at the June 1998 production rate. 5 Our oil is running out, Iraq has plenty. Our politi cians are linked to oil. We've gone to war with Iraq. Maybe these facts are not directly connected. Maybe the USA and UK governments genuinely believed their citizens or soldiers were in imminent threat from Saddam's w eapons of mass destruction. Or maybe they went to war in Iraq for humanitarian rather than geo-political reasons. Few would deny that the world is better off with Saddam Hussein behind bars. The difficulty wit h this argument, of course, is why we haven't gone to war with a doz en similar or worse despotic regimes in the last couple of decades; ind eed, why do we more often seem to support them than attack them, as we supported Saddam himself through the 80s and early 90s."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The Question 5 The argument made here is that not only are these f acts connected, but similar connections can be found through the hi story of the twentieth century and earlier.

Of course there is nothing necessarily w rong in itself for a country to secure its supplies, any more than wanti ng to enlarge your business, to gain more control over your sources - every supermarket plays the same game. And it's natural that business at every level is one of shifting relationships and alliances. And at a basi c economic level, much of the economy is now global. Citizens own stock in countries all round the world. Corporations are of necessity multinatio nal. You may be with me so far; opinion polls suggest th at the majority in the West suspect we didn't go to war with Iraq for the right reasons, even if the majority applaud the (hoped for) outcome: a more democratic Iraq, freed from the specter of Saddam Hussein. 6 But I go further. The second theme of the book is that there is a deeper game be ing played. We're talking here of a level where countries and peoples are pawns in a game. The leaders we elect to serve us aren't necessarily working in our best interests. The logic of these global interests is t o promote multinational, regional, even global government rather than nation al government. It could then eliminate differences in currencies, arm ies, import and export taxes. It could concentrate on increasing wealth wi thout being subject to the vagaries of nation-states. After all, individua l nation-states are erratic, unstable, and (generally) governed in the interests of the people in that country rather than multinational, global interests . Corporations with a global reach need global organizations to influence and operate through. These global interests, focused today around money and oil, act in concert. They form what we can call \"The Syndicate.\" 7 It is bigger than any one individual, or any numbers of individuals. It is mo re powerful than individual \"members\" are aware. Its influence is so pervasive, its ideas so rational, that many - including presidents and prim e ministers - act in its interest without considering the logical outcome. I go still further. Whereas the intention of some i n the Syndicate may be benign, the effect overall is malign. And some a re driven by darker visions. They may sound incredible, but they form t he backdrop to the history of the twentieth century. The events we rea d about tell us that the darkest visions do get put into practice. World dom ination is an ancient dream. The same ambition still drives individuals t oday. And in modern times they have the capacity to make these dreams c ome true. We can only fight them if we're aware of them. And usually, whe n we are, it's too late for millions.

Ezra Pound, America, Roosevelt and the Causes of th e Present War Most of us have a fairly naive attitude to wealth. We think of its creation and maintenance as something separate from the corr idors of power, from politics, particularly democratic politics. Bu t the two are indivisible. It's money that rules. This chapter gives the backg round on who really rules the world today. Our story starts with Mayer Amschel, a Frankfurt Je w, 1 someone you've probably never heard of. A clerk in a bank owned by the Oppenheimers, he worked his way up to junior partner and then left t o take over the business his father started in 1750, buying and selling rare coins. In 1769 he became court agent for the Elector, William IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel. William inherited the largest private fortune in Europe whe n his father died in 1785; the equivalent of $40 million, money paid by Great Britain for the use of 16,800 Hessian troops during the American Re volution. When Napoleon invaded Germany in 1806, William fled from Frankfurt leaving Amschel to guard the equivalent of $3 million, 2 which he buried in his garden. William gave a power of attorney to Budrus von Carlhausen, who made Amschel his banker with the responsibility of collecting interest on royal loans. That is how the Rothschild banking dyn asty began. The name by which Mayer Amschel came to be known, \"Rothschil d,\" came from \"rotschildt\" or the \"red shield\" that hung over the door in the house in the ghetto where his ancestors once lived. 3 When Mayer Amschel died in 1812 he was the richest man ever to have"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"8 The Syndicate lived, 4 with a fortune of $3.5m ( £ 1,669m if related to GDP and not merely multiplied by 35.5 for inflation since 1836). 5 His will was never published, but he established the principle that his fortune w ould pass down through his male descendents through a dynastic line. 6 Like the riches of monarchs, the Rothschilds' wealt h was handed down untaxed. Their private banks were partnerships whose profits were distributed within the family, leaving little for t he government. Indeed, they regarded themselves as monarchs in their own r ight, wealthier than all the crown heads of Europe put together. They ha d banks in London, Paris, Frankfurt, Vienna, and Naples, and from thei r huge profits had built no fewer than 42 great country houses throughout Eu rope. Mayer had five sons, 7 and the lead in his banking empire was taken by the eldest, Nathan. He increased the fortune to 57.5b by 1820 - he boasted he had multiplied his capital 2,500 times i n five years, largely by speculating on the outcome of the Battle of Wate rloo. 8 On June 20, 1815 his selling triggered a mass sale of stock and a price collapse, and his subsequent buying of the market and all governm ent bonds left him owning the country's cash flow and the Bank of Engl and. 9 Wellington won the battle of Waterloo, but the financial independe nce of the country was lost before most people heard the news. Nathan poss ibly had $100b by 1840. It has been estimated that by 1940 the family fortune had reached $500b (worth $20 trillion at today's values), appro ximately half the wealth of America (including banks) at that time. 10 It's hard to estimate the Rothschild wealth today. Frederic Morton, author of The Rothschilds, which was commissioned b y the family, writes, \"Today the family grooms the inaudibility a nd invisibility of its presence.\" It is concealed behind a network of merc hant banks, gold dealings, investments in minerals, and land and pro perty holdings. Under its 2003-formed Netherlands-based holding com pany Concordia BV, Rothschilds Continuation Holdings AG, a Swiss h olding company for the worldwide Rothschild merchant banking business, was the parent of scores of industrial, commercial, mining, and touri st corporations, not one of which bears the family name. 11 Many were accumulated during the spread of the British Empire of which they were a d riving-force. Today the Rothschilds' merchant banks in London and Paris are probably the largest private institutions in the wo rld. They helped fund and finance Royal Dutch Shell and De Beers. In the 1920s the banks"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The Genesis of the Syndicate 9 were organized under the French house into a \"noise less international syndicate that reached from J. P. Morgan in New Yor k to Baron Louis- controlled Creditanstalt in Vienna.\" 12 They bought a 50,000 square-mile tract of land in Canada, the biggest in the history of Canada, which included gold deposits. They influence the Bank of England, Bank of France, and the Reichsbank of Germany, all of which are known a s government institutions-central banks regulating currency - bu t are in effect privately owned by the House of Rothschild as stockholder. Th ey also influence the US Federal Reserve, the IMF, and Geneva finance: in short, the world's monetary policy. 13 The primary business of the London-based N M Rothsc hild and Sons, the most influential of the Rothschilds' houses, ha s been to sell and buy treasuries and gold bullion. At 10.30am and 3pm eac h day they have helped fix the price of gold through the London Bullion Ma rketing Association. Five men have talked by phone for 10 minutes, then lowered tiny Union Jacks on their desks in a ceremony that has been pe rformed daily since September 12,1919. The Rothschilds have earned fees on every transaction involving treasuries and 42m ounces of gold a day - on transfers, calls, puts, trades, and leases. 14 Of the world's above-ground gold reserves (120,000 tons), one third (40,000 tons) is held in central banks and the remaining two-thirds are held privately. It is not known by whom. It is difficult to quantify the world's wealth. Thi s is the sum total of the wealth of all nations, and includes their GDP (gros s domestic product), mineral and oil reserves, investments, and the gold bullion in the world's banks ($30ob). According to a prestigious world wea lth report 15 based on people with more than $1m, the combined GDP of the world in 2002 was $27.2 trillion. (Of this, North America account ed for $7.4 trillion and Europe for $8.8 trillion.) If we reckon that the wo rld's wealth is ten times the world's GDP, then the world's wealth is $272 tr illion. An estimate of the Rothschilds' worth? The Richest Men in the World lists generally exclude dynastic families. If they had $6b in 1850 (a low estimate), 16 then, assuming no erosion of the wealth base, it c ould have been invested to bring in a conservative range of b etween 4% and 8% per annum, which gives figures ranging from $1.9 tr illion to $491,409 trillion 17 (more than the world's wealth according to our est imate).

The Creation of the US Federal Reserve I give a fuller account of the Rothschild story in the companion volume to this book, coming next year, The Secret History of the West. 22 The point of bringing it in here is that you don't get to be this enormously wealthy by making widgets, by buying and selling things. Th e Rothschilds got to be this wealthy through controlling the money suppl y of the nations of Europe. As President Garfield said in 1881: \"Whoeve r controls a nation's money supply shapes its destiny.\" But the Rothschilds were relatively weak in the New World. They tried to acquire an American central bank in the 1860s; L incoln thwarted their efforts by opposing the National Bank Act of 1863, which gave federal banks the power to control the credit and finances of the US. 23 They made another attempt early on in the twentieth cent ury. Central to their new attempt was another German Jew, Jacob Schiff, w ho had arrived in America in 1865. In 1873 they gave him financial ba cking that enabled him to buy into the German Jewish firm of Kuhn and Loeb . 24 Schiff married Solomon Loeb's eldest daughter Theresa and bought o ut Kuhn's interest. He was now effectively the sole owner of Kuhn, Loeb & Co. He became a millionaire by financing railroads, and (with \"Roth schild\" finance) helped Edward Henry Harriman, the American financier and r ailroad magnate, amass the greatest railroad fortune in the world. S chiff (again using \"Rothschild\" finance) also funded Carnegie's steel empire - and John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil. 25 Paul Warburg was also a key figure. He and his brot her Felix, also German Jews, arrived from Frankfurt in 1902 and, financed by \"Rothschilds,\" bought into Schiff's Kuhn, Loeb & Co. Paul married Solomon Loeb's younger daughter Nina - so he and Jacob Schiff were brothers-in-law - and Felix married Frida Schiff, Jacob's daughter, becoming his son-in- law. The Rothschilds sent Paul and Felix Warburg to New York to lobby for Congress to pass the central banking law, which would set up a central bank with the power to create money and reg ulate its value. Paul"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The Genesis of the Syndicate 11 Warburg was responsible for putting together the Fe deral Reserve Act, which was masterminded by Baron Alfred de Rothschil d in London. 26 In 1903, instructed by \"Rothschilds,\" Paul Warburg wro te a memorandum for Schiff on how the European Central Banking syst em applied to America's monetary system. Schiff passed it to the National City bank, where Rockefeller's agent Vanderlip contacted banke rs, including J. P. Morgan, citing Paul Warburg's reputation as a world authority on central banking. In 1907 the New York Times ran an article by Paul Warburg on America's need for a central banking system. In 190 8 Schiff contacted another \"Rothschild\" representative, Col. House, wh o was Schiff's chief representative and courier, and Bernard Baruch, a m ulti-millionaire from stock market speculation, whose advice was sought b y the US President of the day. In 1908 Senator Aldrich (another \"Rothschildite\") i ntroduced a bill that proposed that banks would issue currency backe d by Federal, state, and local government bonds (the first circulation o f paper money by the federal government had taken place in 1861.) This w as criticized, as it would not provide a monetary system that could resp ond to seasonal demand. Representative E. B. Vreeland then proposed basing currency on communal paper rather than bonds. This was passe d, and the National Monetary Commission was established under Aldrich t o approve all monetary legislation sent to Congress. In 1910 Paul Warburg made an influential speech calling for a United Reserve Ban k with capital of $100m, and the power to circulate paper money. A secret meeting was convened. 27 Those invited met on a railway platform in New Jersey and were taken by boat to a hunting lodge on Jekyll Island, off Brunswick, Georgia. The island had been bought in 1888 by J. P. Morgan, John D. Rockefeller's brother William, V anderbilt and other bankers. Those present included Sen. Aldrich, Vande rlip, Paul Warburg, John D. Rockefeller, Bernard Baruch, Col. House, an d Jacob Schiff. One way or another all were linked to the Rothschilds. Ten days later they had agreed upon the concept of what became the Federal Reserve System. Theodore Roosevelt would make the ideal president f or the Rothschilds, and the \"Rothschild\"-affiliated J. P. Morgan and Co . first financed his election bid in 1912. 28 At this early stage it may simply have been to pul l votes away from President Taft, to help the electio n effort of Woodrow Wilson (much as Ralph Nader split the Democratic vo te to allow Bush"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"12 The Syndicate Jr. to beat Gore, and is likely to do the same with Kerry). 29 Wilson won the election, and the Democrats gained control of b oth houses. To avoid mentioning a central bank, Wilson proposed that the new regional banks should be called \"Federal Reserve banks.\" The Feder al Reserve Bill was passed by the House of Representatives and Senate o n December 23, 1913, when many Congressmen and Senators were away for th e beginning of their Christmas break, and an hour after the Senate vote Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act into law. So in one day \"Ro thschilds\" and their supporters, notably J. P. Morgan's First National B ank and Kuhn, Loeb & Co.'s National City Bank, had effectively taken c ontrol of the American economy. The Federal Reserve System was established in Octob er 1914 and began operating in 1915. It acted (and still acts) as a fiscal agent for the US government; it guards the reserve accounts of co mmercial banks, to which it makes loans, and controls the paper cur rency supply in the USA. There was now a \"Rothschild\"-controlled centra l banking system with inflatable currency, which meant that the mone y supply shrank with each loan repayment and could only be kept going by ever-increasing borrowing.

Small co untry banks in the Middle West and West, which had refused to be p art of the Federal Reserve System, were broken. Large banks began call ing in loans, and stocks dropped from 138.12 in 1919 to 66.24 in 1921 . Government bonds plummeted, and banks called in more loans and, when customers could not pay, seized their assets. After 1922 the Federal Reserve's profits rose and i t was able to lend ten times more than its reserves. Credit was easily obtained, and between 1923 and 1929 the Federal Reserve expanded money su pply by 62%. Following a bankers' meeting in 1926, the press rep orted that there were large profits to be made from the stock market. In July 1927 the New York Federal Reserve Board met the heads of European cen tral banks at a secret luncheon. 33 The Federal Reserve Board introduced a cheap-money policy; it doubled its holdings of government securities, a nd as a result nearly $500 million worth of gold moved out of the US to E urope, notably France. This helped trigger the Depression. Details of the meeting were revealed in 1928 in the House hearings on the Stabilizing of the Purchasing Power of the Dollar. On February 6, 1929 Montagu Norman, Governor of the Bank of England and a close friend of Lord Rothschi ld who controlled the Bank of England, visited the US and met Andrew Mell on, the Secretary of Treasury. The Federal Reserve Board then reversed its cheap m oney policy again and raised the discount rate. In March 1929 Paul Wa rburg tipped off the group of families around \"Rothschilds.\" They took t heir money out of the stock market and put it into gold and silver. 34 Between 1929 and 1933 the Reserve reduced the money flow by a third. On O ctober 24, 1929 the New York banking Establishment began calling in loa ns. Customers had to sell stock at low prices to pay off loans. Stock prices fell by 90%, US Securities lost $26b. Thousands of small banks and insurance companies went bankrupt; many millionaires found they were br oke. At home citizens now depended on the government. Un employment was high, there were few job opportunities, and peo ple looked to the government for handouts.

Railr oads dominated the nineteenth century. They opened up the vast interio rs of North America and Asia. They enabled the migration of settlers an d the mass-movement of goods, speeded up the process of Empire, were ke y to industrialization, and allowed large armies to be moved quickly. The t wentieth century became a mechanized century. All these new machines needed power to drive them, and this was supplied by oil. Oil becam e the major source of money. It had been used as fuel for lamps in Berlin since 1853. In 1882 the British Captain Fisher (later Admiral) argued that the British fleet should be driven by smokeless oil fuel rather than coal, t he burning of which made smoke that could be seen miles away. The best oil for this came from Russia. 35 By 1900 Russian oil - the oil of the Caucasus, i.e . Baku and, next in importance, Grozny - accounted for half all oil pro duced in the world. The French Rothschilds had been involved in the Russian petroleum industry since the 1860s and in partnership with a company k nown as Deutsch de la Meurthe had built a refinery at Fiume (then Hung ary's only seaport). 36 The Rothschilds moved in on Baku, the largest Russi an oilfield, and by 1890 \"Rothschilds'\" Baku-based operation controlled a third of Russian oil output. Of $214m invested in the Russian oil in dustry before the First World War, $130m came from foreign capital, 60% of which came from Great Britain. 37 But the key figure in oil was the magnate John D. R ockefeller, and the rise of the Rockefellers to dominate the world's oil sup plies had repercussions throughout the century. Rockefeller had German bloo d: he was descended on his paternal side from a Hessian mercenary (Rogg enfelder, which means \"rye field\" in German), 38 who had Turkish ancestry and had come to America to fight for the British army during the Revolutionary war. He had deserted when offered a bribe of land in New Je rsey. Roggenfelder changed his name to Rockefeller, 39 but it is important to remember the family's German origin. It explains its alliance wi th the German ruler of the day: the Kaiser, Hitler, most recently Kohl, an d in particular with the Rothschilds. John D Rockefeller had \"Rothschilds'\" financial hel p via Schiff. 40 In 1870 when Standard Oil of Ohio was incorporated, Rockefe ller owned 21 out of 26 refineries in Cleveland. Next year Standard Oil (SO - our Esso) was the"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The Genesis of the Syndicate 15 largest refining company in the world, and in 1879 Rockefeller controlled 90% of all the refined oil sold in the USA; he had 20,0 00 oil wells and 100,000 employees. By 1885 he controlled the oil in dustry in the US, and had branches in Western Europe and China. By now Rockefeller was in partnership with \"Rothsch ilds,\" and was granted a rebate on each barrel of oil he transport ed on the Kuhn, Loeb railroads of Pennsylvania, Baltimore, and Ohio. 41 In 1892 he moved to New Jersey because the oil trust he had formed was not acceptable to Ohio. He now began tax-avoidance schemes under the guise of philanthropy (such as the University of Chicago, Medical Researc h, General Education Co.). 42 The German-American Rockefellers sought control of the world's oilfields. The main obstacle was the Royal Dutch Co mpany, which was supported by the Dutch and British Empires. \"Rockef ellers\" could not compete in the European markets with Royal Dutch (w hich was able to ship oil from its Baku and Ploesti fields at lower prices), so they began a propaganda war against their rival company. This le d to a price war. The price war hurt the Royal Dutch Co., and Henri Deter ding, its head, rescued it from bankruptcy by persuading \"Rothschilds\" to m ake a loan in return for a minority interest. 43 \"Rothschilds\" now had a stake in Royal Dutch. John D. Rockefeller's wealth rose from $20om in 189 9 to $1b by 1911 (equivalent to well over $13b in today's money). 44 He then benefited hugely through the break up of Standard Oil by the US Supr eme Court in 1911, which gave Rockefeller 30 days to shed 37 subsidiar ies. This led to the creation of 34 separate companies. Shares doubled, even trebled, and Rockefeller's wealth soared. 45 By 1930 the profit of the Standard Oil Company was estimated at $900 million, a third of which went to Rockefeller personally. 46 It has been estimated that not long afterwards he had ines timable trillions, but that may be an exaggeration. What is clear is that by the time he died in 1937 \"Rockefellers\" owned a known fortune of at least $5b (worth about $200b now). 47 They were the richest family in America and some sources say had overtaken the Rothschilds as the ri chest family in the world. Rockefeller owned 20% of American industry a nd had given away $55om to \"philanthropic\" tax-saving projects, 48 leaving a tax bill of only $10 million.

The rapid rise of \"Rockefellers\" in the early 1900s was a wake-up call for the Rothschilds. The mouth they had fed was bit ing back. Rockefeller was now competing for their oil in Mexico, Russia, and the Middle East. In 1911 they exchanged their entire Russian operati on for more shares in Royal Dutch Shell, and became the largest sharehold er in the company. 49 The Rothschilds and Rockefellers were now in direct competition. Like Mayer Amschel Rothschild's five sons, John D. Rockefeller's five sons (John III, Nelson, Laurance, Winthrop, and Dav id) each went into a different sphere of \"Rockefeller\" enterprise: \"phil anthropy,\" government, business, oil, and banking. The five Rockefeller so ns were a mirror image of the five Rothschild sons. They all worked within the commercial empire. Nelson Rockefeller became Governor of New York and Vice-President, while David Rockefeller became Chairman of Chase Ma nhattan Bank.

Similarly you c ome to dominate the world production of oil by controlling the ground t he oil is lying in: by owning it or leasing it on good terms. This means d ictating the politics of the region. This is why the Rockefellers are so important to the history of the twentieth century. It is their interests tha t determine the areas of conflict, their actions that drive events. In 1900 the world's oil production was dominated by Britain - in Mexico, the Ottoman Near East, Saudi Arabia, and th e Caspian region. 51 \"Rockefellers\" waged an economic war to wrest these territories from imperialistic Britain and the first half of the twe ntieth century was about their victorious campaign to replace Britain as the main oil empire in these regions. The story of how \"Rothschilds\" and \" Rockefellers\" funded different sides of the Russian revolution is told i n The Secret History of the West.

After all, there was no significant territorial dispute between France, Germany, and Britain to account for it, let alone one to draw in the USA and half the rest of the world. Dig underneath the surface politics, the individuals, and it's oil that led to the First World War, in particular Germany's attempt to seize British oil in the Near East. The German- American Rockefellers were closely involved in it. In 1904 the Germans had been given a concession by the Ottoman Turkish Sultan Abdul Hamid, with an option to drill the Baghdad-Mosul oilfields , which had previously been promised to Americans. Then in 1905 Britain, t hrough the spy Sidney Reilly, acquired the right to drill for oil there, beating off competition from the French Rothschilds. 52 In 1912 the German government exchanged their concession for a quarter interest in Turkish Petrol eum Co., which was 75% owned by the British government through Royal D utch Shell and the Anglo-Persian Co. (thereby excluding \"Rockefellers\" from the Mosul field). \"Rockefellers\" fanned German resentment at being ou tmaneuvered. 53 The Kaiser then turned to \"Rockefellers\" and with their financial help built the Berlin-to-Baghdad railway so he could drill the oil fields under Ottoman control and wrest Near Eastern oil from his imperia listic competitor, the British. 54 The Kaiser was thus threatening to seize Egypt and eliminate British control of the Suez Canal and sever the Bri tish Empire's lifeline. This aim put Germany on a collision course with Gre at Britain. The Rockefellers' distant Turkish ancestry also ena bled them to approach the Ottomans. In 1914 Standard Oil loaned the Turki sh government $35m, and in return were permitted to drill for oil in Ot toman territory. Through Chase National and Kuhn, Loeb, and in accordance wi th a deal they made with the Kaiser via Warburgs, \"Rockefellers\" gave t he Kaiser $300m to finance the First World War through the Federal Res erve System, which stipulated that any bank losses would be financed b y the US Treasury. 55 Their Standard Oil interests made a deal with the G erman government under which their holdings were taken over by the R eich with full compensation, and they supplied the Germans with th e oil they required for the conduct of the war. 56 (A similar deal between \"Rockefellers\" and the Germans took place at the beginning of the Second W orld War and led to Senator Truman's charge of treason against Standard Oil.)"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"18 The Syndicate \"Rockefellers\" Wrest Oil in Near East When a Serbian (who was also a Grand Orient Freemas on) called Gabriel Princip assassinated the Austrian Archduke Franz Fe rdinand events were running out of control in Europe, and the First Wor ld War began on June 28,1914. The Rothschilds, split between five countries, supp orted their own countries and found themselves on the sides of both Great Britain and Austro-Hungary. But Britain was going broke. In 191 5 the New York banking-house J. P. Morgan and Co., the top America n \"Rothschild\" representative, was named (with the approval of Woo drow Wilson) as the sole purchasing agent for all war supplies from the neutral US. 57 By 1917 Britain had ordered $20 billion worth of arms on Morgan's account (on which Morgans took 2%, making $400m). Britain h ad won the war and become the dominant world power on borrowed mon ey. John Foster Dulles calculated that Britain, France, and the All ied Powers owed the US $12.5 billion at 5% interest, but were owed $33 bil lion by Germany in war reparations. By 1919 England owed the US $4.7b in w ar debts, and the British national debt had risen drastically from £6 50 million (1914) to the then huge amount of £7.4b. 58 America loaned the allies $3b and another $6b for e xports.

One factor that initi ally pushed the Americans to the British side was the sinking of th e Lusitania by a German submarine in 1915.

In December 1914 England broke the German war code.

In his third will he left his wealth to Nathan Mayer, Lord Rothschild who, for strategic reasons was replaced by Lord Rosebery in the seventh will. Lord Rosebery (who was British Prime Minister in 18 94-5) had married into the Rothschild family in 1878 (his wife Hannah was the daughter of Mayer Rothschild). 5 Rhodes's intention was that the £3m fund he left in 1902 should promote the concept of globalism and one-world govern- ment, and it set up the Rhodes Scholarships, whose beneficiaries have in- cluded Dean Rusk (US Secretary of State throughout the 1960s), Senator Fulbright, and President Bill Clinton. The Round Table had come together at a time of rapi d revolution in communications. The development of flight, which wa s demonstrated by the Wright brothers in 1903 and led less than a doz en years later to planes flying in the First World War, together with the de velopment of wireless radio made the problem of great distances surmounta ble and a new round of pressure for world government seemed timely.

These three organizatio ns worked closely with the Council on Foreign Relations to promote a Unite d States of Europe.

Underneath the land of Atlan tis is the Latin phrase \"Novus Ordo Seclorum\" (which strictly means \"new se cular order\" or \"new order of the ages\").

The tag gave currency backing to his \"New Deal\" pol icy (adopted on advice from the young Nelson Rockefeller and first announc ed in July 1932). 24 The Utopian pyramid on the reverse of the Seal has now come to be a symbol of the New World Order, the still uncomplete d unity of a world government in which all nations are bricks. The mea ning of the Seal is that it's America's spiritual destiny to complet e its building, that the Templars have been given the task of building a wor ld government under the watchful eye of Sion, that when the sun-rayed c apstone - symbolizing the Merovingian successor to the ancient King of Je rusalem - is finally lowered onto the pyramid, the world government will be complete. 25 This could all be coincidence. But if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, let's be open to th e possibility at least that it is a duck. American republicanism was Templ ar.

As America grew and more states were added between 1784 and 1854, the principle of regional government established by the Founding Fathers extended throughout the United States. More recently the whole of North America has drawn together.

Standard Oil supplied Hitler with petroleum, while I. G.

In August 1934 it was announced that Standard Oil, New Jersey had acquired 730,000 acres of oil land in Germany from the North European Oil Corporation. They built extensive refineries in Germany for the Nazis and supplied them with oil, payment (in June 1936) being millions of harmonicas (sic) and a number of ships. 18 It built a refinery in Hamburg that produced 15,000 tons of aviation gasoline each week and operated throughout the war. 19 Also before the war, Standard Oil's oil tankers manned with Nazi crews refueled German U-boats. 20 Standard Oil also sold the Nazis artificial rubber, 21 and ball-bearings for anti-aircraft guns. 22 The refineries were eventually handed over to Hitle r. 23 From 1933 until 1944 Standard Oil of New Jersey (\"Rockefellers\") an d Sosthenes Behn, a subsidiary of ITT, made payments to Himmler. 24 Why were Standard Oil and other \"Rockefeller\" indus tries so keen to support Hitler?

From 1935 to 1939 vast sums of money were poured in to Nazi Germany by the Syndicate. US multinationals were profiting from Hitler's military construction program at least until 1942. 34 Germany's largest tank produc- ers were Opel, a subsidiary of General Motors (cont rolled by J. P.

He immediatel y delivered his famous \"blood, toil, tears and sweat\" speech, and a fter Dunkirk began trying to draw the Americans into the war. He imple mented his new pro- Zionist outlook. On May 23 he gave orders that Brit ish troops should be withdrawn from Palestine and that the Jews should b e \"armed in their own defence and properly organized as rapidly as po ssible.\" He knew this would be sympathetically received in the US and be seen as a first step towards establishing the State of Israel of the Bal four Declaration.

Commercial production began in March 1938. 43 But the British controlled Saudi Arabia through the king, Ibn Saud, whose atte mpt to be leader they had backed in return for protection for the Suez Ca nal, the sea route to India. \"Rockefellers\" found that the British, inclu ding Royal Dutch and Shell, blocked their development. The British contr ol of Arabia predates the First World War. Using Col. T. E. Lawrence of B ritish Intelligence to befriend the Arabs and lead an independence move ment against the Ottoman Empire, they encouraged Sharif Hussein, the ruler of Mecca, to attack the Turks. Ibn Saud granted the first Arabia n oil concession in 1923 to a British investment group, the Eastern and Gene ral Syndicate. In 1913 the British armed the Abdul Aziz and Wahhabi famili es, and supported Ibn Saud Abdul Aziz. Ibn Saud captured Medina in 19 25 and proclaimed himself King of Hijaz in 1926. When Arabia was rena med Saudi Arabia in 1932, the British were in full control of oil co ncessions in the country. This was a consequence of Lawrence of Arabia's work - and the British government's disregarding of promises Lawrence made to the Arabian leaders. 44 The British government had controlled the Gulf's oi l from before the First World War, and had a controlling interest in Anglo-Persian Oil Co. (a forerunner of BP) 45 and the London-based Iraq Petroleum Company. When the Ottoman Empire collapsed it was Britain (i n the person of Sir Percy Cox, High Commissioner in Baghdad, acting for Winston Churchill, Colonial Secretary) who drew the boundary lines bet ween Iraq, Kuwait, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. The British had set up th e Red Line Agreement of 1928, which restricted foreign oil companies.

Th ey wanted American entry on Britain's side to be conditional on her si gning over (i.e. agreeing to prevent the US development of) all the Saudi-Ara bian oilfields and perhaps promising to de-colonize after the war. 48 Hitler unleashed massive bombing raids on London in August and September 1940 to soften Britain up before a cross- Channel sea-borne invasion. To carry this invasion, Hitler massed suf ficient barges to carry 50,000 troops and their equipment in ports from Ost end to Le Havre. 49 Churchill, desperate for American help after the de bacle of Dunkirk, was now confronted with a stark choice between letting potential Saudi-Arabian oilfields go and promising de-colonization, or fore going American help. It was a rerun of the choice he had encountered after the Battle of Verdun in 1916, 50 when he had signed the Baghdad-Mosul oilfields to \"Rockefellers'\" Standard Oil to introduce American help that would win the First World War. He realized that unless he now, once again, ga ve \"Rockefellers\" what they wanted, the British would lose the Second Worl d War and the British Empire would be destroyed. He signed the Saudi-Arab ian oilfields over to Standard Oil. He perhaps promised to de-colonize at the end of the war. Some time after Dunkirk, June 1940, Churchill asked Roosevelt, his cousin, to lend him the arms to defeat Hitler, paym ent to be deferred. Roosevelt agreed, stipulating three conditions: the surrender of all British assets in the US (see note 52); the surrender of Br itish oilfields in Saudi Arabia; and (I believe) the surrender of British co lonies in the future.

Maybe they were only interested in oil. But his mot ivations and ambitions were clear to those who knew him. It's well known t hat Hitler had an occult background. As a youth in 1909 he renewed ac quaintance 61 with Jorg Lanz von Liebenfels, who two years earlier had founded the \"Order of the New Templars,\" which used the swastika as its s ymbol. (It seems that Hitler first met him at school before 1900.) 62 Liebenfels wrote a letter later in 1932 that Hitler would \"develop a movement that would make the world tremble.\" 63 In 1919 Hitler is thought to have joined the Thule Society, which practiced black magic and worshipped Satan. 64 The Thule's leading figure was Dietrich Eckart, one of the seven founding memb ers of the Nazi Party. This had begun as the German Workers' Party, founde d in Munich in 1919 by Anton Drexler, another member of the Thule Socie ty. 65 The Thule Society sought the lost Nordic homeland o f Thule (a northern Atlantis, as it were), and its members thought them selves political masters of the earth. 66 The Thule - and Hitler - worshipped Rex Mundi: Sat an, who had equal status with God (Jehovah, the creator of the material world and therefore a demiurge). 67 From this Society Hitler learned to manipulate Vril, the hidden energy of the earth, in rituals. 68 Through the Ahnenerbe (the German Ancestral Heritage Organization) and Ku rt Wiligut, the ex- Thule Nazis focused on the Externsteine, a group of awesomely high rocks with an eerie, primitive atmosphere, the highest pa rt of which (Irminsul) held an ancient pillar of the Saxons. 69 At Schloss Wewelsburg, a school for SS leaders owned by Himmler, rituals were performed in a subterranean crypt with a stone stoup. This chamber was known as the Realm of the Dead, and it was intended that Hitler would be inte rred there. 70 In the Great Hall above the crypt, the 13 Knights of the O ak Leaf met at a round table. 71 On his deathbed Eckart predicted that Hitler would make an impact on the world: \"Follow Hitler. He will dance, but it is I who have called the tune! I have initiated him into the 'Secret Doctrin e,' opened his centers in vision and given him the means to communicate wi th the Powers. Do not mourn for me: I shall have influenced history m ore than any other German.\" 72 While in prison at Landsberg in the 1920s, Hitler h ad dictated the first volume of Mein Kampf to Hess.

Hitler only ser ved nine months of his sentence. Out of prison, Hitler lived in Eckart's h ouse on the Obersalzberg, near Berchtesgaden. 75 As a result he came to love the area, and in due course built the Berghof nearby. Nuremberg: Center of the World Hitler had selected Nuremberg, the city of the Holy Roman Emperors, as his seat after the war. Conrad III, who was the fir st Hohenstaufen to be Holy Roman Emperor and German King, held court ther e before he left for the Second Crusade in 1147, and Otto IV convene d the Imperial Diet there. To consolidate his rule, Hitler planned for the time when he would be crowned Emperor - Kaiser Adolf I - of Germany. A nd he would not just be Emperor of Germany. When he had accepted th e surrender of the Soviet Union, the United States, the British Empire including India, and in due course his ally Japan, he would be Emperor o f the whole world, whose representatives would have to be accommodated . At Nuremberg Hitler began an impressive building pr ogram modeled on ancient Rome. He built the Coliseum, an open Con gress Hall, to accommodate 50,000 representatives. This was never finished, but can be visited today. Near this neo-Roman Coliseum was the grandstand of the Zeppelinfeld, built between 1935 and 1937, wher e Hitler stood on a podium and addressed no fewer than 1.6 million pe ople one day in 1938. Also nearby is a lake that was gouged out to be a stadium capable of accommodating a crowd of 350,000 to 450,000 peop le. A wide route, two kilometers long, was built to lead to the Castl e. Hitler declared that Nuremberg would be the scene of party congresses \"f or all time.\" His election as Emperor, \"Kaiser,\" would be completed b y electors meeting in the Castle, as had happened throughout its long history. The Marzfeld (\"march-field\") at Dutzendteiches (\"dozen ponds\"), the Stadium and the New Congress Hall (or Coliseum) would make Nurember g the center of the new pagan Holy Roman Empire. Hence the Roman sy mbolism: the Coliseum, the eagle (on the Nazi standard and in th e name Eagle's Nest).

It would have been the center of th e world had he won the Second World War and achieved world government. It is unlikely that Hitler would have felt beholden to the Syndicate if he had achieved his dream of world power; he had, after all, seized con trol of banks in Germany and canceled the national debt. The Syndicate no do ubt reckoned that they could control him until they replaced him, 77 perhaps after assassinating him, and that through the partnership they would wi n control of all the world's oil. The Final Solution What distinguished Hitler was not his ambition, or its occult origin, but his commitment to carrying it through. He put the m ost horrific fantasies into action. He prepared for a new order in Europe that would follow his victory in the war. The concentration camps wer e expanded, and extermination camps were added to them, at Auschwit z and Mauthausen, for example. The \"final solution\" of the Jewish pro blem - first proposed in May 1941 at the time of the invasion of Russia a nd confirmed at the Wannsee Conference in Berlin on January 20, 1942 - was put into practice, and between July 1942 and January 1945 some 4.5 to 5.5 million Jews 78 (1.5 million on some counts) were gassed in 1,500 c oncentration camps across German-occupied Europe. The Zyklon B that ga ssed so many Jews in the holocaust was produced by a pest-control sub sidiary of the German company I. G. Farben, Tesch/Stabanow and Degesch. 79 Some 5 million Jews had been stripped of £2.7b duri ng the Second World War (worth £102b in today's currency). The Na zis seized much of this money when they invaded France and the Low Cou ntries - including much property of the French Rothschilds - and they removed it to Swiss bank accounts, where it has remained to this day. M uch of this money was deposited in the Bank for International Settlem ents, which was dominated by Hitler. 80 The BIS board included Montagu Norman of the Bank of England, whose major stockholder was the Ho use of Rothschild, but he was in a minority on the BIS board. 81 The Rothschilds are likely to have been unaware that they were benefiting from th is money."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"62 The Syndicate The Syndicate Now Back Stalin In fact, Hitler was now losing the war.

Instead, the Ploesti oilfields were insufficient; Rommel had seized the Suez Canal rather than British-Persi an oilfields and the Japanese had attacked South East Asia rather than R ussia. 82 At the end of 1942 Hitler was defeated at el-Alamei n and at Stalingrad, and his Empire began shrinking. He stayed in his he adquarters in the east, the Wolf's Lair, fed optimistic news by Bormann, hi s secretary, his mood controlled by injections given by his physician, Dr . Morell. In July 1943 Mussolini was arrested and there was an armistice i n Italy. The U-boat campaign was failing, and the Allies were bombing G ermany to rubble. In July von Stauffenberg nearly killed him when a b omb went off at his East Prussian headquarters, the Wolf's Lair.

The world of the 1930s was one of fading European E mpires. 2 The Second World War destroyed them. Hitler had failed to establish a new European Empire. The Syndicate now took a new tack. They encouraged the division of the world into blocs, with individu al national aspirations being suppressed. The progress of the Cold War can be described in st ages. From 1944 to around 1949, an Eastern European bloc was establ ished under Stalin. Simultaneously a Western Empire bloc was created th rough Marshall Aid, and cemented with the EEC in the 50s. The European Empires in Africa and elsewhere were dismantled and leveled in the 50 s to 70s by Cold War/ local conflicts. Both Eastern and Western blocs att empted to use the newly created UN for their own ends. Their competition re ached its height in the Kennedy/Krushchev era. The next twenty years sa w a new phase of Soviet expansion. Around the world there's a series of messy conflicts, highlighted in Cuba, Vietnam, Congo, Iran, Afghanis tan, and the former Yugoslavia.

The CFR/Syndicate Create the UN The foundation of the UN can be traced back to 1939 , when the League of Nations ceased functioning and the American Council on Foreign Rela- tions began planning its replacement. On its advice , the US State Depart- ment set up a \"Special Research Division\" in 1940, headed by the CFR's Leo Pasvolsky and totally staffed by the CFR. 7 The CFR's Foreign Affairs urged the creation of a \"Commonwealth of Free Natio ns\" a few months before Pearl Harbor in 1941. 8 The term \"United Nations\" was first used of the nations opposing the Axis powers (Germany, Ital y, and Japan) on Janu- ary 1, 1942, when 26 \"united nations\" made a declar ation of war aims. 9 The plan for a UN was conceived at the Moscow Confe rence in 1943 when Molotov, Litvinov, and Vyshinsky proposed it t o Cordell Hull, US Secretary of State from 1933 to 1944 and a devot ee of expanding world trade, and Averill Harriman as a means of bri nging peace. Hull recommended approval, and the Senate approved the p lan. 10 The idea of the UN was proposed at the 1944 Dumbarton Oaks Conf erence, where Molotov worked on the draft of the UN Charter with \"Rockefellers\" employee, and later Nelson Rockefeller's personal r epresentative at the UN, Alger Hiss (a former State Department official who was convicted of perjury in 1950 and exposed as a Soviet spy, and wh o was therefore not acting on the Americans' side). 11 The Charter of the UN was written at Yalta in February 1945 by Molotov, who represented the Soviets, and Alger Hiss, who represented the \"Rockefeller\"-Soviet Axis and the CFR (\"the Rockefeller Foreign Office\"). 12 Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin agreed at Yalta that the UN should be established. 13 The CFR had taken over the State Department by 1939 . 14 Funded by \"Rockefellers\" ($0.5m from both the Rockefeller Fou ndation and Carnegie Endowment after the war), 15 it has nominated most of the officials in every President's administration since the 1920s. 16 The American delegation to the UN conference at San Francisco in 1945 contained at least 47 CFR members. 17 Under Alger Hiss, the founding conference's Secretary-General, the long-a waited organization was formally created and the US Senate approved the idea in days. 18 In"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"68 The Syndicate December 1946 the Rockefeller Foundation donated a check to buy 18 acres of land in Manhattan on which the UN building was built: John D.

(Right from the outset, the Soviet Union held three votes to America's one in the Gene ral Assembly. 24 At the Dumbarton Oaks Conference of August 1944 the Soviet delegation had shocked Roosevelt by presenting Stalin's demand for 16 votes, one for each republic. At the Yalta Conference in February 1945 this was reduced to three: the USSR, Ukraine, and White Russia.) 25 The UN's structure included a Security Council that then consisted of 11 members, which had responsibility for maintaining international pe ace and security.

A risky confrontation between the US and USSR came when the Russians blockaded Berlin, which had to be supplied from the West by air for over ten months. In 1947 during a congressional debate Bernard Baruc h, now a congressional advisor, was the first to describe th e open but restricted rivalry between the US and USSR on political, econo mic, and propaganda grounds as \"Cold War.\" 30 It was an appropriate term for Stalin's competitio n with the West. Taking advantage of the non-interfer ence of the UN, Stalin had created a Russian empire of satellites. Stalin also took advantage of UN non-interference t o seek parity with the US following the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombs and turn the Soviet Union into a nuclear power. The Soviet Union rejected the Baruch Plan of 1946, which asserted that no nation could u se its UN Security Council veto on atomic issues. 31 By 1949, largely through espionage, it had built its own atomic bomb. Alarmed by the growi ng Soviet might, the British became an atomic power in October 1952. To keep its lead (and with relatively few bombs) the US developed the hyd rogen bomb, which was exploded in August 1953. An arms race began. As a reaction to Stalin's moves in Eastern Europe, the US, Canada, and the UK and some of the free European and Scandinavi an nations formed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Ap ril 1949, funded for five years by the German Marshall Fund (i.e. \"Rocke fellers\"). Under the Treaty an attack on one nation would be regarded as an attack on all. The US was the power behind NATO and supplied most of t he aircraft.

In 1926 Stalin addressed the Politburo : \"There should be a Federated State of Europe, to which the USSR would adhere and in which ... Great Britain would be included. Once Great Bri tain had been absorbed the USSR would ... become the dominant power.\" 32 Under the stress of Stalin's pressure, Europe had turned away from its old imperial system to a new political economy in the regional Stalin t radition which left the old European Empires vulnerable. During this weaken ing, the economic power of the US remained overwhelming. As well as planning the establishment of the UN, th e CFR reconstructed Europe. Through the CFR's Harry Hopkins, Jean Monne t became personal advisor on Europe to President Roosevelt. 33 The CFR and Monnet devised the Marshall Plan for European recovery after the S econd World War. 34 From 1946 to 1947 David Rockefeller acted as secret ary to a CFR study group on European reconstruction. The plan was larg ely funded by \"Rockefellers,\" for whom Gen. Marshall acted as a p roxy. 35 The Plan was conditional upon the re-establishment of capitalism , linked to the Truman Doctrine of blocking communism globally. It poured billions of American aid into Western Europe ($13b initially, $72.5b by 1959) 36 to combat Stalin's moves. CFR study groups planned the recons truction of Germany and Japan, and the creation of the IMF and World Ba nk as well as aid to Europe. 37 Between 1943 and 1947, flushed with knowledge of A merica's nuclear supremacy, American leaders spoke confident ly of US domination of the globe, which would extend the benefits of We stern capitalism and representative government to all peoples - by estab lishing a New World Order. 38 North Korea By the 1950s, Western Europe is relatively secure. Russia looks to make progress elsewhere in the world, and switches its a ttention to the east rather than the West. As well as controlling half of Russi an oil \"Rockefellers\" owned substantial reserves of Chinese oil. They enc ouraged rapprochement between the two countries, which led to a 30-year t reaty with Mao in 1950. Emboldened by this, the North Koreans invaded South Korea.

Nationalists won the elections of 1950 and rescinded Egypt's tre aty with Great Britain a year later. General Naguib overthrew King Farouk in 1952. Colonel Nasser took over from General Naguib. He wa s of Jewish origin, his real name was Nasserbaum and his father is buri ed in the Orthodox Jewish cemetery in Cairo. He had good links with th e Soviet Union, and was armed by them. 42 They in turn were funded, as we have seen, by \"Rockefellers,\" who had financed Stalin's Five Year Plans since 1925. 43 At the heart of the Suez crisis was the Aswan dam p roject. Bigger than the pyramids, the cost was over $1 billion. The Wor ld Bank was prepared to lend $200 million at one point if America and Br itain lent $70 million. John Foster Dulles (a partner of \"Rockefellers\") is sued a high-handed State Department statement saying that the American offer was withdrawn. Provoked, Nasser announced in July 1956 that he was nationalizing the Suez Canal (which had been bought by N. M. Rothschi ld and Sons for the Disraeli government from Egypt's debt-ridden Kh edive for £3.68m in 1875), and that the revenues would pay for the buil ding of the dam. The three \"Rothschildite\" countries, Israel, France , and Great Britain, colluded to attack Egypt in October 1956. 44 Eisenhower (\"Rockefellers'\" man) instructed John Fo ster Dulles to block the Israelites when they were about to seize the Suez Canal and save Nasser to fight another day. 45 Dulles went to the UN Security Council, and when that action failed, to the General Assembly. W ith a \"heavy heart\" he said: \"The Israeli-French-British invasion is a gra ve error inconsistent"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"72 The Syndicate with the principles and purposes of this charter.\" 46 He also exerted great pressure on the British and French, who withdrew th eir troops. 47 The Suez adventure, which was in the mold of nineteenth -century gunboat diplomacy, marked the end of British imperialism, w hich was so identified with the Rothschilds. Hungary At the same time as the Suez crisis Hungarians were rising against the Soviet Union, and appealed to the West for help. Th e Syndicate wanted the Eastern bloc to remain intact, and America was also bound not to interfere as it had agreed at Tehran and confirmed at Yalta the principle that Hungary was part of the Soviet sphere of influ ence. In contrast to their actions at Suez, when the Americans effectively for ced the \"Rothschild\" countries to pull back, in Hungary they left it to the Soviets. The same happened in Czechoslavakia in 1968. West European De-colonization There were eight Western European Empires (the Brit ish, French, German, Dutch, Belgian, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese Em pires) all of which held territories tempting to the \"Rockefellerite\" S yndicate and opposed by the Soviet Union. The British Empire bore the br unt of insurgency at first. 1948 had seen anti-European insurgency in India, Bu rma, Malaya, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The first (anti-Fre nch) Indo-China war had already begun. Riots in West Africa led to a pr omise of independence for the Gold Coast, and in 1952 the Mau Mau terrori st organization began fighting in Kenya. There was three-way fighting in Cyprus. But the Cold War took on a new impetus after Suez. Britain no longer looked like providing the kind of World Government that Cecil Rhodes had envisaged. In 1957 the Earl of Gosford, Joint Parliamentary Under-Secr etary of State for Foreign Affairs, presented Britain's retreat from e mpire in terms of being subsumed within a different kind of world governmen t: \"Her Majesty's Government are fully in agreement with world govern ment. We agree that this must be the goal, and that every step that is humanly possible must be taken to reach that goal.\" 48 "},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"The Two States; the Cold War 73 Egypt hosted a Solidarity Conference of the people of Asia and Africa in 1957 with backing from the Soviet Union.

De-colonized governments would in future be responsible for thei r own financing - and the costs of keeping their starving populations fed and healthy.

Libya turned anti- Western with Gaddafi's revolution in 1969. Elsewher e in the Third World, Indonesia had already turned anti-Western, as had P eru. Chile turned Marxist in 1970. Soviet weapons entered the African countries from Algeria and Egypt in Soviet-built AM12 transporters .

Money reached these organizations from the p ro-\"Soviet World Council of Churches\" program to combat racism.

On October 28 Krushchev agreed to withdraw the missiles if the US promised not to invade Cuba at a later date. The picture on Cuba is still confused, forty years later. Krushchev undeniably supported Cuba and intended to move miss iles there. Did \"Rockefellers\" encourage him to threaten America be cause that would spur the US administration to spend more on arms, i .e. borrow from the Syndicate? 50 It was also a base for revolutionaries to seize oi lfields throughout South America. Maybe \"Rockefellers\" want ed Cuba as a training-ground for subversion in Latin America and attempts on Latin American oil with Soviet support? The \"Rockefellerite\" Kennedy was in office to do th e arms spending/ borrowing the Syndicate wished. But he lost the plo t, and attacked Cuba, seeking to overthrow Castro. Then he lost his nerve , denying the Bay of Pigs operation air cover in April 1961 and refusing to follow it up. The Syndicate came to regard him as \"a loose cannon,\" w hich is why Gov.

The prime example of this is the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963. The received opinion is that there was only one assassin involved in the Kennedy shooting, and he was assassinated himself. There was no deeper motive, no conspiracy. I'd like to believe this, and of course it may be t rue. In a way it would make life simpler if random acts of evil were indiv idual aberrations.

F. Kennedy was making enem ies. He himself had been educated at two \"Rockefeller\"-subsidized i nstitutions, Harvard and the London School of Economics, where his teach ers included the Fabians Harold Laski and John Maynard Keynes. As a senator he served \"Rockefeller\" interests. 56 But maybe he fell out with the Rockefellers, which is why on November 9, 1963 Governor Nelson Rockefeller announced that he would be seeking the Republican nomination for President. After all, huge oilfields had been discovered off the coast of Vietnam in 1950, a nd \"Rockefellerites\" had fanned the fear that Vietnam might be lost to C ommunism. Kennedy wanted to end American involvement in Vietnam by 19 65, and by 1963 he had withdrawn 1,000 troops. The day after the as sassination President Johnson escalated the war in Vietnam. Kennedy had also tried to strip the \"Rothschildian\" Federal Reserve Bank of its power to loan money to the government a nd receive interest. On June 4, 1963, Kennedy had signed executive Order no. 11110, which returned the power to issue currency against silver bullion in the US treasury's vault to the US government. He put $4.3b into circulation and was about to put the Federal Bank of New York out o f business. This would have been a catastrophe for the Syndicate. 57 Most of the current US national debt of more than $ 7.5 trillion has been created since 1963 and had Kennedy's attempt to eli minate the US debt - by eliminating the Federal Reserve's control over the creation of money - worked, the US national debt would now be on a fa r more manageable level.

A 1959 photograph shows a delig hted Nelson Rockefeller pretending to box the widely beaming Nikita Krushch ev. They were clearly on familiar terms. When David Rockefeller visited M oscow crowds lined the streets from the airport. The Politburo was run by the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Elders.

Are the elders the elders of Sion, or Zi on? Is it a freemasonic Council? This might sound fanciful.

Despite his blustering, larger-than-life dealings w ith America (which included removing a shoe and banging it on a table in the UN building), and although \"Rockefellers\" were funding an increas e of missiles against Russia, \"Rockefellers\" expected Krushchev to advanc e their commercial interests in Asia. 60 Krushchev's prestige had suffered over Cuba, and h is strong anti-Maoist policy had interfered with Sovie t-Chinese trade, which was important to David Rockefeller, President of Ch ase Manhattan Bank, 61 who now had the rights to all oil exported from Chi na. 62 \"Rockefellers\" had gone to great lengths to defend their Chinese o il interests against the Japanese, and in the past had made representations to President Truman and the US war cabinet (in which \"Rockefellerites\" were in the majority) 63 and influenced the decision to drop the first atomi c bomb on Hiroshima to protect \"Rockefellers'\" oil interests in China from an invasion by Japan. 64 In August 1964 trade between the USSR and China had broken down because of the feud between Krushchev and Mao, and to make matters worse on August 5, 1964 the US bombed several insta llations in North"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The Two States; the Cold War 77 Vietnam for the first time.

It was a difficult meeting, the subject be ing Krushchev's failure to advance \"Rockefellers'\" oil interests. David Roc kefeller's daughter Neva took notes. 67 In October Krushchev was ousted.

The North Vietnamese are thought to have been armed at the end of the Second World War by Laurance Rockefeller, Gen. MacA rthur's assistant, who sold weapons and munitions from the US stockpil e on Okinawa to Ho Chi Minh, leader of Vietnam. 70 Maybe Rockefeller hoped that Vietnam would drive out the French so that Standard Oil cou ld develop the as yet undeveloped offshore oilfields. After the defeat of the French at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, Ho reneged on the deal to exploit the offshore oil for Vietnam. 71 The whole of Indo-China stands on an oil basin. Dur ing the Indo- Chinese war of 1946-54, Standard Oil began - in 195 0 - a search for oil off Vietnam. They conducted a seismic survey of the seabed that lasted 10 years. 72 By 1960 they had located vast oil reserves.

To effect such unity, there had to be a war which w ould preferably lead to South Vietnamese victory; or failing that a Nort h Vietnamese victory which would establish long-term stability.

Now the American public had been alarmed by Soviet \"expansionism\" the way was clear for the Syndicate to intensify th e war in Vietnam. Kennedy wanted to scale it down - in fact, pull out of Vietnam - for vote reasons. He was murdered. At the time of his death in 1963 there were 16,000 American advisors in Vietnam. Johnson, his s uccessor, increased the US's military involvement. There were 3,500 US troops in Vietnam in March 1965, 75,000 by July 1965, and 510,000 by ear ly 1968.

In total there were 223 training camps, the biggest number being in the USSR. Fifty terrorist groups from the Soviet Union and its satellites were centrally coordinated by the Palestinians. The Syndicate wanted to create a United States of t he Middle East, which would give it access to oil. The process was furthered by the confrontation between Palestine and Israel, for it created two blocs within the Middle East, which could eventually become one regional bloc, with Israel and Palestine living harmoniously together, as conflict gave way to reconciliation. Terrorism furthered this end and was an instrument of policy. For example, the terrorist Carlos \"the Jackal,\" who liv ed in luxury in Libya in the early 1970s, kidnapped Sheikh Yamani in 1975 , at the time Saudi Arabia's oil minister and the most powerful figure on OPEC, an act calculated to influence Saudi Arabia's and OPEC's o il policy.

He wrote to his cabinet in October 1942, \"Hard as it is to s ay now, I trust that the European family may act unitedly as one under a Cou ncil of Europe. I look forward to a United States of Europe.\" In 1946 in Z urich he said, \"We must build a kind of United States of Europe.\" 4 A United States of Europe (which included Russia) h ad been envisaged by Count Coudenhove-Kalergi in his Pan Europa in 19 23 and three years later at his first Pan-European Congress. Coudenhov e's ideas influenced Jean Monnet, deputy secretary general of the League of Nations from 1919.

Spinelli admitted that his United States of Europe could not come into existence democratically, but would have to be impl emented gradually, without the peoples of Europe grasping what was hap pening until they were presented with a constitution. Jean Monnet car ried the vision forward, becoming President of the European Coal an d Steel Community in 1952. \"This\" he declared, \"is the government of Europe.\" Monnet's proposal for a \"United States of Europe\" to Paul-He nri Spaak, the former Belgian Prime Minister, was returned to him with al l references to a \"United States of Europe\" or \"supra-national govern ment\" deleted. 6 The pretence was then adopted that it would be an econo mic community, and it was on that basis that the Treaty of Rome wa s signed in 1957, setting up the EEC. The trend towards a united Europe seems unstoppable . The UK is a case in point. Having stayed out of the EEC in its early days the British Prime Minister Ted Heath won the election in 1970, and on e of his first acts was to appoint Victor, Lord Rothschild as head of h is think-tank, where he served from 1970 to 1974. As a result the UK was admitted into the EEC in 1972. 7 Even Margaret Thatcher signed up to the Europe tha t was later regulated by the Maastricht Treaty. But she a lso stood up for Britain's sovereignty and to retain the Falklands' oil. When the Bilderberg Group met at La Toja in Spain in May 1989 the \"Rockefelle rite\" Henry Kissinger was reported as complaining that Thatcher was oppos ing the creation of a European Central Bank, which was crucial to the Uni ted States of Europe. 8 This Bank was a \"Rockefellerite\" concept and would counterbalance the Rothschilds' Bank of England, the American Federal Reserve System, and the City. The decision was taken to speed up a Unit ed States of Europe that would include the Eastern European nations jus t emerging from Soviet rule - another \"Rockefellerite\" concept, for \"Rothschilds\" did not want the republican Eastern European nations in its monarchist Europe. A whispering campaign was started against Margaret Thatcher, the British Prime Minister, because she opposed any further sur render of British sovereignty to the German-dominated European Union."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"The United States of Europe and Russia 87 A call went out for Thatcher to be overthrown. The call was answered - perhaps by a coincidence of aim and timing rather t han to do Bilderberg's bidding - by the \"Rothschildites\" Michael Heseltine and Sir Geoffrey Howe, whose crucial interventions and speeches crea ted a loss of confidence in the Prime Minister and resulted in he r failure to win the leadership contest, as a result of which she resign ed. The \"Rothschildite\" Thatcher was overthrown and replaced not by the \"Ro thschildites\"' first choice, 9 Michael Heseltine, but by the lesser-known, John M ajor. Though elected by the Conservative Parliamentary Party, ma ny of whom had not heard of the Bilderberg Group and were certainly no t operating under its control, he was expected by the Syndicate to do Bil derberg's business: 10 pass the Maastricht Treaty in the English Parliamen t and agree to a single European currency, a Central Bank, and a Court in S trasbourg that would order member nations to rewrite or cancel some of t heir laws. Major disappointed his \"Rothschildite\" supporters a s he had a tiny majority and was barely able to get the Maastricht Treaty bill through Parliament. He also prevaricated on the single curr ency, saying that the European countries could have one if they wanted bu t that the UK would wait and see. British Devolution In May 1997 John Major was replaced by another \"Rot hschildite,\" 11 Tony Blair, who like a cuckoo in the nest took over Majo r's policies with the benefit of a large majority. His election was helpe d by the billionaire, Sir James Goldsmith, a relative of the Rothschilds, sta nding against Major. Blair had attended the April 1993 Bilderberg meetin g at Vouliagmeni in Greece - Gordon Brown, later to be his Chancellor, had attended the 1991 meeting - and he listed his visit two years later i n the Commons Register of Members' interests (paras 1, 5, and 7 of the \"Ap pendix to the Third Report of the Select Committee on Standards and Pri vileges,\" published in Hansard). In 1998 Blair denied that any member o f his government had ever attended any Bilderberg meeting when challenge d by Christopher Gill MP in a written Commons question (Hansard, Mar ch 30, 1998, cols. 375-376). Technically his answer was correct, as bo th Blair and Brown were not in the British government when in oppositi on."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"88 The Syndicate Once elected, Blair made sweeping constitutional ch anges. In July 1996 Blair had visited Kissinger at his office in New Yo rk, shown on a TV clip at the time. Kissinger was reported later as saying , tongue in cheek, \"The illegal we do immediately, the unconstitutional tak es a little longer.\" Blair devolved Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland (in whic h the victorious IRA share power with the Protestants), and London. 12 One result of these changes was to loosen the ties between Scotland and England by giving Scotland its own Parliament, thus weakening the UK. If the Scottish National Party win a general el ection, then a sovereign independent Scotland will not join a United States of Europe. The ownership of dwindling supplies of North Sea oil wi ll pass to Scotland in either case. Blair is also prepared to split England into eight further regions with tax-raising powers. 13 In July 2002 it was reported (in London's Sunday Te legraph, July 7, 2002) that according to Dr. Richard North, director for t he Europe of Democracies and Diversities, Britain's local government system was to be replaced by a network of regional governments, which will control planning, education, and the police. The prototypes of these bodies were set up in the UK in 1994 to receive regional funds from Brussels, funds that would otherwise not have been paid. The study by Dr. North revealed that John Prescott, Britain's Deputy Prime Minister, has masterminded the process of bre aking Britain up into regions since 1970 when he was leader of the L abour group in the European Parliament and delegate to the Council of Europe. In 1996 Prescott outflanked New Labour's party policy by se tting up his own \"regional commission,\" chaired by former Brussels C ommissioner for the Regions Bruce Millan. When Labour took power in 1997 this regional commission enabled Prescott to push through regiona l governments for Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, and London, but also \"regional development agencies\" for the eight remaining Engli sh regions, which became regional governments-in-waiting. According t o Dr. North on the continent regional governments are able to bypass n ational governments by relating directly to Brussels, i.e. by receiving funds from Brussels and in return exercising powers granted by Brussels . 14 Europe is thus likely to become a political union that is a networ k of federal regional governments."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"The United States of Europe and Russia 89 Currency From January 2002 the euro circulated in 12 out of 15 EU countries, and by the end of February 2002 the euro replaced all 1 2 European currencies, except for Britain's, Sweden's, and Denmark's. The following currencies ceased to be legal tender: the French, Belgian, and Luxembourgian franc, the German mark, the Dutch guilder, the Italian lir a, the Greek drachma, the Spanish peseta, the Portuguese escudo, the Aust rian schilling, the Finnish markka, and the Irish punt. The British Pri me Minister Blair, returned to power with a virtually unchanged majori ty in May 2001, declared (in the handed-out text of a speech to the Trades Union Congress in September 2001) that he would support a successf ul single currency and the campaign for the euro to replace the pound. Syndicate plans for Britain and an enlarged Europe to be fully \"eur o-ed\" therefore look unstoppable. In his pre-budget address on November 27, 2001, the \"Rothschildite\" British Chancellor Brown 15 reported that Britain has paid off a substantial amount (£51b) of national debt (i .e. he has repaid money borrowed from \"Rothschilds\" and others, and old iss ues of stock), and has cut debt interest payments to their lowest level si nce 1918, to 31% of the government's total expenditure (against 40% in the US, Germany, and France and 95% in Italy). Seen from this perspectiv e, Britain's economy falls within the Maastricht criteria, and although after a £6b surplus it faces four years of deficits (beginning with a pred icted deficit of £12b), requiring more borrowing and a new issue of governm ent stock and an increase in the national debt, it is stronger than the other economies of Europe. Alarm was expressed that this position migh t be weakening when in October 2002 Britain's foreign trade deficit was a record £3.56b, the largest monthly deficit since William of Orange ord ered trade records to be kept in 1697. 16 industries In 2003 Britain's fishing industry lost its self-su fficiency. In 1970 Britain, Norway, Ireland, and Denmark had fishing rights tha t extended 200 miles from their shores and owned 90% of Europe's f ish. The day their applications to join the EEC arrived the Six (Franc e, Germany, Italy, Belgium,"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"90 The Syndicate the Netherlands, and Luxembourg) issued a law that all countries in the Common Market would have equal access to each other 's fishing-waters. Heath sacrificed Britain's fishing-waters in return for entry into Europe, but concealed the truth from Parliament. 17 In 1982 a 20-year \"transitional phase\" of the Common Fisheries Policy came into for ce. Spain had only limited access to British waters, which were now de signated \"Community\" waters, and was compensated by £4b of EU taxpayers' money (£500m from UK taxpayers) and invested this in modernizing its trawlers. On December 31, 2002 this 20-year phase ended, and tho usands of British vessels had to be removed to make room for Spanish trawlers in 2003. Under the guise of \"cod conservation\" British ships were restricted to fishing nine days per month, forcing many fishermen into retirement, and some into bankruptcy. 18 Britain's farming industry, which made the nation-s tate self-sufficient during the Second World War, is now facing the bigg est crisis in its history as a result of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Subsidies have encouraged farmers to produce unwanted surpluses - eggs, poultry or sheep meat, beef, pigs, potatoes, wheat, barley, mi lk - that have to be destroyed. British farmers have had to compete with produce from Spain, which is cheap due to cheap labor and round-the-yea r sun. They have been paid in relation to their \"hectarage\" and compensat ed for \"set-aside\" (land left fallow). Prices have fallen, and some farmers' incomes have fallen to a quarter of what they were 10 years previously. Abat toirs are closing. CAP reforms in 1993 and 2000 imposed production control s and cut farm prices while compensating farmers through direct pa yments. However, reform has not put a stop to overproduction and col lapsing livestock prices, and a drift away from farming can be expected. In c omparison Britain will be even less self-sufficient. 19 As a result of the British miners' strike of 1984, when Scargill opposed the closure of 20 pits, 170 pits were reduced to 12 . 20 Ten of the 22 nuclear power stations in the UK were designated for decommissioning. As a result Britain would cease to be self-sufficient in the production of electricity. In 2004 London was i mporting much of its electricity from France. 21 As each industry (fishing, farming, coal, electrici ty) was eroded, national independence was diminished and European i nterdependence was advanced."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"The United States of Europe and Russia 91 Policing On May 22,2002 the EC's President Romano Prodi, a S teering Committee member of the Bilderberg Group in the 1980s, called for \"a giant step forward in European integration,\" an EU government with control over criminal justice, taxation, and foreign affairs - \" a supranational democracy\" in an enlarged union of 25 or 30 countries with com mon border controls, \"an integrated European police force,\" and a public prosecutor to fight EU financial fraud. Under his proposal the bureaucr acy in Brussels would implement tax and budgetary harmonization and would acquire a diplomatic and economic machinery that would enable the EU to compete with the US. All decisions would be made by majorit y voting, and no nation would retain the power of veto. In early June 2002 it was revealed in London's Obse rver that the EU is drawing up a \"common code\" on data retention, an d that Europol, the police and intelligence arm of the EU, compiled a d ocument in The Hague in April 2002 that proposes that telephone and Inte rnet firms should retain millions of pieces of data, including detail s of visits to Internet chat rooms and of calls made on mobile phones and t ext messages, for up to five years. All e-mails, other Internet infor mation and telephone records should be made accessible to the European p olice and intelligence services. Britain has put pressure on other member states of the EU to put this legislation in place. In Britain legislation was passed in 2000 permittin g only the police, customs, intelligence agencies, and the Inland Reve nue to obtain communications records. Under the Regulation of Inv estigatory Powers Act this power has been extended to two dozen ministrie s and quangos: seven more government departments including the Departmen t of Health, every local authority, the Environment Agency, the Food S tandards Agency, the Health and Safety Executive, and the Post Office. M inisterial assurances that the power was aimed at tackling crime and terrorism has been undermined by the extension of the power to the Food Standards Agency.

France wan ted the Euro-army to be based in Lille and to be flying 600 aerial sorti es a day by 2006. 23 British troops would take orders from French generals. Blai r has allowed the principle of a European army to be based on English soil. 24 In September 2003 he backed Franco-German plans to give the Euro -army the means to plan and carry out missions outside NATO's command. Constitution In October 2002, the European Commission gave the g o-ahead for a \"Big Bang\" admission of 10 new states in early 2004. Thi s would reunite Europe in a 25-state Union and add 73 million citizens fro m poor countries: Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Slov enia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Malta, and Cyprus (but not Turkey) - with Romania and Bulgaria expected to follow by 2007. The admission would cre ate a behemoth of 370m people stretching from Galway to Gdansk, the w orld's largest market. At the same time the constitutional convention base d on the Philadelphian Convention of 1787 and chaired by former French Pre sident Valery Giscard d'Estaing proposed a \"preliminary draft constitutio nal treaty.\" This was the \"new Charter for the EU\" that was urged by Presiden t Clinton when he visited the Bilderberg Group's meeting near Brussel s in the summer of 2000 (see page 239) and that was adopted in Nice in December 2000. (Ireland ratified the Nice treaty at its second att empt.) After months of discussion within the Convention on the Future of Europe, which was grappling with the task of cha rting the course of European enlargement, Giscard d'Estaing proposed: a set of rules for a united Europe that would give Europe a single const itutional structure with its own legal identity and bill of rights, and foreign and defense policy; moving power from the nation-states to Brus sels; binding Britain and all Europe's states into a super-state: renamin g the European Union"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"The United States of Europe and Russia 93 \"the United States of Europe\" (an idea immediately opposed by the British, who wanted a Union of European nation-states and fe ared being dragged into a European super-state); giving all citizens \" dual citizenship,\" i.e. both national and European citizenship - a proposal that in itself elevated the EU to statehood. 25 The main consequence of these proposals was that al l states including Britain would lose the right to veto plans for fore ign and defense policy, and tax harmonization and the collection of taxes - measures needed to subsidize the economies of the 10 newly admitted po or countries. Brussels would decree the amounts that all nation-states, in cluding Britain, should pay, and these amounts would be redistributed under international- socialist principles throughout the newly enlarged European Community. Really poor nation-states like Lithuania and Latvia would therefore be subsidized by the richer nation-states such as Brit ain. In November 2002 Lord Tebbit, the British Minister injured in the IRA Brighton bomb in 1984, accused Blair of seeking \"the destruction\" of the UK and \"its absorption within a foreign juri sdiction.\" In the Ian Gow Memorial Lecture he said: \"The outrages in Yugo slavia and those of September 11 in New York have confirmed in the m ind of Mr. Blair the need not merely to submerge the UK into a Euro- state but to create a wider world authority.\" He spoke of Blair's \"attemp ted obliteration of the culture and history\" of the UK - of social reforms that undermined the family, and criminal and civil law reforms that ove rturned a thousand years of English (i.e. post-Alfred) jurisprudence, and of \"his resolution to cede our very currency to foreign interests.\" He said th at initially he believed Blair's ambitions were confined to the creation of a European identity to replace an identity of Britishness, but that he now believed Blair sought the destruction of the UK and its surrender to European jurisdiction: \"Never before have we had in office ... a Prime Minister w ho detests our history, our constitution, our institutions and indeed the v ery nation we are and whose intention is to subjugate us to foreign rule, \" i.e. Europe. The draft text of the European constitution filled the British government with dismay in February 2003. Sweeping aside Britis h objections, the document established the EU on a \"federal basis\" wi th \"primacy over the law of its member states.\" Under its provisions all nation-states would lose control of their foreign policy and defense (a provision which would have made it impossible for Britain to fight a war in Iraq), and economic"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"94 The Syndicate governance, and would be stripped of their sovereig n power to legislate in almost all areas of national life. Instead there would be \"shared competence.\" Britain's parliamentary democracy woul d be abolished, as everything would be within the competence of Bru ssels. No one state should be allowed to block the majority, the conven tion's president Giscard d'Estaing said. The British government accused an e lite group of insiders on the convention's 13-member presidium of carrying out a \"federalist\" coup. The text of the constitution was drafted by a triumvirate of federalists: two commissioners, Michel Barnier of France and Ant onio Vitorino of Portugal, and the former Italian prime minister Gui liano Amato. Article 46 of the secret draft text of the new Euro pean constitution was leaked before it was presented to the 105-strong Co nvention on the Future of Europe by the presidium headed by Giscard d'Esta ing. It contained a tough secession clause that would make it illegal f or Britain to leave the European Union without permission. Secession would have to be approved by two-thirds of member states, and a minority bloc of states could impose conditions offering no guarantee that a departing c ountry could keep its trading rights or reclaim currency reserves held by the European Central Bank. David Heathcoat-Amory, a British Conservative MP on the convention, called the text outrageous and said, \"It's a prison clause, not a secession clause ... We're no longer talking about a voluntar y union you can leave whenever you want. It is the final extinction of pa rliamentary sovereignty.\" The significance of the new constitution now dawned on Britain. It threatened to usher in a new order that would overt urn the governing basis of British parliamentary democracy for ever. The EU would become the fount of power with its own legal personality, and would delegate functions back to Britain. Article 9 in the draft s tated, \"The Constitution will have primacy over the law of member states.\" A European interior and justice ministry (Eurojust) would have power to launch raids across the EU, including Britain, and Westminster would be prohibited from legislating in public health, social policy, transp ort, justice, agriculture, energy, economic and social cohesion, the environme nt, internal and external trade, and consumer protection. One worrying feature of the constitution was that t he new state would have power over Europe's energy supply. If a majori ty of EU heads of state agreed, it would have the power to transfer the rem nants of North Sea oil gas, and coal to any EU state in a global energy cr isis, to ensure the security"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"The United States of Europe and Russia 95 of energy supplies in the EU. This would mean Brita in surrendering control of multi-billion-pound oil stocks to Brusse ls. The new state would also be able to raid Britain's £600b pensions fund and distribute it to less provident European states. At the Athens Summit on April 16, 2003, in the Stoa of Attalos, the 10 new members were welcomed to the EU. Blair called for a President of the new enlarged Eu rope \"who could speak regularly to President Bush,\" and it was felt that he may have been putting himself forward for the position in the future, 26 presumably as a reward for delivering Britain into the euro in the near fu ture. It was confirmed that the convention would support Blair's idea that Europe should have a full-time (rather than a rotating) President and Fo reign Secretary for the new super-state. Blair, fresh from cooperating with Bush in the Iraq War, apparently saw no contradiction between an Anglo-Am erican alliance in war and a pacifist Europe in which Britain would be one of 25 states under a European President and Foreign Secretary who woul d dictate future relations with America. At Athens, however, Europea n leaders failed to agree whether the EU should have a permanent chairm an or president, and Blair went home early and was missing from the comm unal photograph. Stirred by public opposition to the new constitutio n, Blair had to deny the United States of Europe in both name and deed. In the face of rising British resentment, he laid down a series of \"red l ines,\" which Britain would not cross. (If the new constitution was merely a \"t idying-up exercise,\" why the need for \"red lines\"?) He said he would not all ow British sovereignty to be put at risk. He said he would not allow a common foreign and security policy, with one European Foreign Minister deciding on all matters of British foreign policy, or tax and benefit harmoniz ation. In June EC President Romano Prodi demanded that nat ional vetoes (\"red lines\") should be scrapped altogether. He als o demanded an end to Britain's veto over key policies such as taxatio n. D'Estaing said that scrapping further national vetoes may be the only w ay of securing a deal on the new constitutional document, and that foreig n policy issues and tax rates should be decided by majority voting. Britain would have more votes than minnows such as Luxembourg, but there was a re al prospect that Britain could be outvoted on foreign affairs or tax matters. In the final version, the preamble of the new const itution omitted the EU's former goal of \"an ever-closer union\" and the word \"federal.\" It stated"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"96 The Syndicate that \"the people of Europe are determined to transc end their ancient divisions, and, united ever more closely, to forge a common destiny.\" In horse-trading, Britain agreed to a new EU Presid ency, elected by the Council of Ministers every two and half years from 2009, in return for having one commissioner rather than two with full v oting rights for 10 years of every 15. The Commission would have an inn er core of 15 with full voting rights. There would be 736 Euro-MPs. One Eur ocrat, confirming that signing the constitution would mean renouncing vestigial sovereignty, said: \"This is more important than Maastricht, Amst erdam, and Nice combined.\" As Beethoven's \"Ode to Joy\" celebrated f inal agreement on the draft proposals, Germany, Denmark, and Spain stated that the blueprint for an EU super-state was the most fundamental treaty s ince the Community was set up in 1957. Britain's representative stormed out of a drafting meeting at a move by d'Estaing to allow future treaty changes without requiring ratification by national parliaments. An \"escalator\" clause slip ped into Article 24 at the last moment allowed Brussels to insert future a mendments without asking national parliaments for permission. This me ant that Eurocrats could rewrite Europe's, and Britain's, constitution without Westminster being given a say. At a summit in Thessalonika, Greece in June 2003 d' Estaing gave out leather-bound copies of the draft European constitu tion to EU leaders, which he called \"a great leap forward.\" To Blair's mortification it was agreed that the German anti-Bush Foreign Minister J oschka Fischer, leader of Germany's Green Party, would be the first EU Foreign Minister and in charge of European policies towards weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, and rogue states. Blair caved in. Public ly, in the presence of the EU leaders, Blair welcomed the text, saying it stru ck the right balance; he made no mention of British red lines on defense, taxation, or foreign policy. In the British press he hailed the new draf t constitution, which was on course to surrender as many as 26 British vetoes , \"a victory for Britain\" - and, blanked by the other European leaders and is olated, slipped away a day early without holding a press conference. President Jacques Chirac of France and Chancellor S chroder of Germany stayed to the end of the meeting, and the irritated Prodi, in Blair's absence warned the absent Blair that Britain would be force d to give up control over its tax, foreign, and defense policies and tha t his \"red lines\" policy"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"The United States of Europe and Russia 97 was \"doomed to fail.\" \"It is up to the IGC [inter-g overnmental conference of October 2003] to do this,\" he said.

I n the event it collapsed over voting rights. Poland (one of the new countrie s) and Spain, who had each been allocated 27 votes at the Nice summit in 2000, refused to accept less. Germany, with double Poland's population, onl y had 29 votes, and refused to accept Poland's 27. The Polish premier L eszek Miller had been badly injured in a helicopter crash 10 days previou sly.

Witnesses said tha t the helicopter fell out of the sky, tilted sideways, and clipped trees before coming down in a field, and Miller broke two vertebrae in his back . The crash was blamed on frozen engines or contaminated fuel. The helicop ter had been used by the Pope when he visited Poland and had recently passed a technical check-up and been declared airworthy. Miller attend ed the summit in a wheelchair, in pain from injuries to his spine, and refused to give way. All went home early on December 13. There was talk of a new attempt in May 2004 - or 2005, or even later according to some cou ntries. Had \"Eutopia\" been postponed or abandoned? The truth is, the courageous determination of the P olish government on one issue had saved the British people - albeit temporarily - from being betrayed by a deceitful British government in to signing up to a constitution that would have destroyed British law, liberty, and democracy. I cannot help wondering how the Polish premier, who was already known to be opposed to compromising on voting rights at t he conference, came to have a helicopter crash just 10 days before the conference.

Ten simultaneous bombs went off on S panish trains killing 200 people. The explosions influenced the general e lection a few days later. Spanish voters returned the Socialist Party, who were committed to withdrawing Spanish troops from Iraq and immediatel y reversed Spain's alliances. The new Prime Minister elect, Jose Zapat ero, spoke of renewing \"a magnificent relationship\" with France and German y. Spain turned from supporting the Anglo-American alliance and war in I raq to supporting the Franco-German alliance and opposing the war in Iraq, which it now regarded as illegal. Al-Qaeda had split the Western war alliance. The Polish Prime Minister, reacting to this new situation, sai d that it would be \"very dangerous\" for Poland to be isolated and that he wo uld not continue to block the constitution. The German Chancellor went to Warsaw at the invitation of Leszek Miller, and the two men reache d an understanding. Miller then announced his resignation. The change of attitude in Spain and Poland's subseq uent acceptance of the voting system meant that the constitution co uld be agreed sooner than expected.

There wer e reports that the 10 new agencies would be running most of Britain by Ju ne 2004. On June 18, 2004, no doubt to enormous \"Rockefeller ite\"/\"Roths- childite\"/Bilderberg rejoicing, agreement was reach ed in Brussels on the EU constitution - but not on the identity of the Pr esident of the European Commission. According to Belgium's prime minister G uy Verhofstadt, the new constitution was the \"capstone of a Europea n federal state.\" The Belgian vice-chairman of the constitutional convent ion and author of the constitution, Jean-Luc Dehaene, confirmed that it w as a blueprint for a European super-state and \"marks the EU's passage fr om a socio-economic Europe to a more political Europe.\" It certainly ca me close to fulfilling Jean Monnet's Utopian vision. The EU was now a state in its own right with its own legal personality. As a constitution is by definition \"the principles on which a state is governed\" the EU state draws le gitimacy from this. The new constitution was a legal framework for a ne w state, the book of rules for micro-management by the unelected Brussel s bureaucracy, the Commission and Council. It was now clear that the new constitution would be interpreted by the European Court of Justice, and its application would be decided by lawyers and judges. The new state would control all labour laws by a new charter of fundamental rights and would fulfill a n ew duty to \"coordinate economic policy\". According to senior lawyers EU la w was now set to have precedence and primacy over parliamentary statutes/ national laws and national constitutions, whether written or unwritte n - and therefore over all British law and British representational democr acy. The myth-perpetuating Blair made much of Britain's retention of its red lines on tax, foreign policy, defense, and social s ecurity (all of which will be quietly discontinued a few years after the referend um, like his predecessor John Major's opt-out from the Social Chapter), and kept quiet about the 248 British amendments that were rejected - only 27 out of 275 British amend- ments were included in the final draft.

The new constitution would lead to the British surrender of the right to veto in 43 new areas. Thirty-six other articles would result in Britain's ceding legislative powers to the European Parliament. If the constitution was ratified, Britain could be outvoted on asylum policy and its own legislatio n could be set aside by foreign judges. It seemed that Britain's seat on th e UN Security Council would have to be surrendered to the new EU Foreign Minister when Brus- sels requested. Giscard d'Estaing, who led the cons titutional convention, said that 90% of the original draft of the constitu tion had been left intact, with 13,500 out of the original 14,800 words unchan ged. It only later became clear that Britain had lost co ntrol of its economic policy, for in a last-minute sleight-of-hand amendm ent, the power to dictate economic policy was transferred from the Eu ropean Council to the Council of Ministers, where decisions can be made b y qualified majority voting. If the constitution was ratified, Britain c ould be forced to adopt economic policies that were against the British nat ional interest and which were opposed by Britain. Despite evidence of overwhelming opposition to Brus sels in the European elections a few days previously, which saw the emergence of the UK Independence Party that seeks Britain's with drawal from Europe, Blair, with no mandate from his people, had signed up to an extraordinary leap forward into a European federal super-state - while insisting that he had retained a Europe of nation-states. Britain had had experience of creating such a federal state, having created Canad a, Australia, India, and the ill-fated Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. The super-state, a new entity, would finally arrive by stealth; the end of the process would be the covert rescinding of all red l ines after full ratification. A 48-nation European Union/United States of Europe including all the ex-USSR territories was now a firm possibility. If any country voted against ratification (which had to be completed by the end of 2006), the constitution would fall. The way was clear for a Eu ropean Constitution Bill to be brought before the British Parliament in the autumn of 2004 and for ratification to be the main issue in the im pending British general election expected in 2005. This would be followed b y a referendum, which had to be held by June 2006. The new constitution h ad to be ratified by 25 national parliaments and 6 referenda in all.

In a secret deal struck with Lord Cranborne (for which Cranborne was sacked by Hague), they had initially been allowed to stay until the second stage of reform was completed. Although this had not happ ened, Blair decided to press ahead with removing the last hereditary pe ers, and the new Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, announced the decision i n September. Their removal would leave a Lords of \"yes men\" who could approve a new European constitution and entry into the euro. Blai r's constitutional coup, whereby he removed the hereditary peers who could b e expected to vote against the new European arrangements, was effected in two phases and spread over several years. In June 2003 Blair announced in a reshuffle like a coup d'etat that the 1,400-year-old office of Lord Chancellor (which can be traced back to 605), the \"Keeper of the Queen's Conscience,\" the o ldest secular office, would be abolished and replaced by a Ministry of Ju stice. Blair was supposed to consult the Queen, the judiciary, peers , and the Opposition, and was summoned to Parliament by the Speaker to ex plain his actions. The Queen was reported to be furious; the feeling w as that the monarchy would be next. She sought independent legal advice on the threat to the role of her sovereignty under the new constitution. 27 In early 2004 it was announced in a parallel thrust that can be seen as mere smartening up of an image that the Crown Prosecution Service woul d be renamed the Public Prosecution Service. It was claimed that the Queen broke her Coronation Oath to her people in 1972 when she allowed Parliament to pass 28 the European Communities Act and gave it the Royal Assent. According to Dist rict Judge Morgan in his judgment on the \"metric martyrs\" on April 9, 2001, the Act surrendered the sovereignty of the British people to the EU. Morgan was not subsequently rebuked or reprimanded, and so his interpretation s tands. Therefore since 1972 Britain has ceased to be a sovereign nation, a nd the British have been without a Queen. 29 For many centuries the Lord Chancellor has handed t he Queen's speech to the Queen at the State Opening of Parliament.

Under the Laeken declaration of December 2001, it w as proposed that the President of the EU should be elected - giving him/her an electorate of over 300m citizens and thus making him more powe rful than any of the leaders of Europe's nation-states - and that a convention (based on the Philadelphian Convention of 1787) would consider a new constitution for an integrated United States of Europe with an elect ed President. In January 2003 Schroder and Chirac agreed that there would be two Presidents of the EU: one to chair the European Council of Minist ers, elected by Euro- MPs (the French choice), and one to be President of the Commission, elected by the European Parliament (the German, mor e federal choice). Rebellion Now a group of members of the Convention on the Fut ure of Europe, the body writing the new constitution, planned to p ublish a minority report opposing the main proposals. Some 12 politic ians from eight countries (including Britain, France Sweden, Denmar k, and Ireland) proposed to abolish the European Union and replace it with a \"Europe of Democracies.\" European countries should not lose th eir veto on foreign policy, taxes should not be harmonized and the Euro pean Union should not be renamed \"the United States of Europe.\" There was now a campaign (launched by the Campaign for a Referendum on the European Constitution) to request the Queen to block the European constitution, which was modeled on the US constitut ion, to prevent the British way of life from being destroyed. A petitio n to the Queen urged her to withhold the Royal Assent from any Bill incorpor ating the constitution into British law. It was suggested that Britain sho uld have associate membership of the new blocs so that it could be par t of a single European market, but not a political union. It emerged that the original version of the EU con stitution had contained a section that said it should be approved by the people of Europe.

The only British political figure with the resolve and determination to oppose the new European constitution in deed rather than in word was lain Duncan Smith, who had been elected Conservativ e Leader by the rank and file membership of the party. A spate of negati ve stories in the press now suggested that the majority of Conservative MPs was calling for him to be replaced as Opposition Leader. A report alleg ing improper payments to his wife from public funds was submitted by an i nvestigative journalist to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Si r Philip Mawer, who later cleared him. Ambitious women within the Conse rvative Party making the allegations perhaps hoped to gain by being rewa rded by a replacement Leader, but the allegations were coincidentally to the advantage of those in the Bilderberg Group who championed the euro and the new European constitution. From their perspective, the allegatio ns could only help secure a victory for their puppet Blair at the next Genera l Election by splitting and weakening the Conservative Party, and if succes sful, might bring the additional benefit of replacing Duncan Smith wi th a pro-euro, pro- constitution Leader. This is exactly what happened. After six weeks of t urmoil and unsourced stories about plotting MPs in the press, on Thursda y October 23 Duncan Smith launched a nationwide petition for a referend um on the new constitution (a policy vehemently opposed by Ken Cl arke). Within days 25 (mostly unnamed) Conservative MPs forced a vote of no confidence in Duncan Smith under the new Hague rules. On Octob er 29, 2003 Duncan Smith lost the vote 90 to 75 and was removed as Leader. He was replaced by Michael Howard (son of an European immi grant, a Romanian whose name when he came to Britain was Bernat Hecht ) in a putsch by th Parliamentary Party. Duncan Smith had been elect ed by the 320,000 Conservative membership, and had defeated his rival Ken Clarke 61% to 39%. This electorate was not consulted. At his news conference (launched by \"Rothschildite\"Lord Lamont, a director of N. M. Rothschild & Sons who had attended the 1995 Bilderberg meeting as a Briti sh delegate along with Emma Rothschild, daughter of Victor, also a British delegate) 31 to declare his candidature for the Leadership, Howard said tha t the Conservative Party would be centrist and \"internationalist\" in o utlook.

The coup had been brilliantly organized as the part icipants were all thinking in the currency of effectiveness, leadersh ip, and integrity, and the MPs and journalists involved - and probably even Ho ward himself- had little idea of the game plan behind the no-confiden ce vote. It was later revealed that the part-time Shadow Cab inet Minister Oliver Letwin, son of a Ukrainian/American academic (who h ad worked at N. M. Rothschild & Sons since 1986 and been a director si nce 1991, and who at that time still worked there every morning) was instrumental in giving Howard a clear run. 32 He had visited David Davis immediately after Dun- can Smith conceded - Letwin's office at the Commons was next door to Davis's - and had established that Davis would not be standing. 33 He took the message back to the Howard camp. Davis's decisi on not to stand color- ed the decisions of other rivals, who followed suit . It was reported that Ken Clarke decided not to stand following a meeting wit h Howard to establish his agenda, including his European policy. Having h eard this, Clarke was happy to endorse Howard but elected to remain on th e backbenches so he could criticize any deviation from a \"Euro-centr ist\" position. From the Bilderberg/\"Rothschildian\" perspective, Letwin had delivered Howard's sole candidature, while Clarke had delivered the sh aping of Howard's European policy (by threatening to stand if it was not acceptable to him). Howard issued a credo of \"I believes.\" It closely e choed John D. Rockefeller Jr.'s credo given in a 1941 radio broad cast and mounted on a plaque outside his complex in New York. A Conserv ative spokesman admitted that Howard's credo (written by a copywrit er at M & C Saatchi) had been \"partly influenced by the design of a comm emorative plaque to John D. Rockefeller Jr.\" but Howard professed no t to have known that Rockefeller had issued such a credo. It seems that Howard had changed his outlook to an internationalist position. He could be expected to oppose but not bl ock the new European constitution and the euro.

In fact, Britain's annual contribution to the EU budget was, at the beginning of 2003, £12b a year, and recent studies by the Institute of Directors an d Institute of Economic Affairs have concluded that Britain would be better off by £10b a year if it ran its own farming policy and by a significa nt additional amount if it ran its own fisheries policy. British trade h as been penalized by the Common External Tariff and over the last 30 years B ritain has had a trade deficit with other member states in every year exce pt 1980 and 1981. 34 Swiss, Icelandic, and Norwegian citizens outside th e EU enjoy far higher standards of living than their EU counterparts. In Germany the euro is nicknamed the \"teuro\" (a play on the German word fo r \"expensive,\" teuer). After a year of the euro, the EU suffered economic slowdown and strain as half its member states were destabilized by one- size-fits-all interest rates, which caused them to overheat or slump. Germ any's Stability and Growth Pact, which was devised to stop debtors deba uching the euro by reverting to inflationary deficits of more than 3% of GDP, was broken by Portugal. Germany (in slump and with 4.5 million unemployed) and France (pledged to tax cuts) were set to break the Pact. For the three months to November 2003 the overall B ritish trade deficit was a stunning £10.2b. 35 Exports to non-EU countries rose by 12.9% compared with a year before, whereas exports to the EU, which account for a far greater proportion of our trade, fell by almost the same amount. The widening balance of payments deficit was attrib uted to a fall in North Sea oil production. According to the Treasury Pink Book (which gives de tailed estimates of the UK' s balance of payments) for 2000, Britain' s payment to the EU budget was £8.433b and receipts were £4.241b, leaving a sh ortfall of £4.192b, and a total shortfall since 1973 of £27.323b. A less au thoritative calculation has Britain's gross contribution as £10.719b and net co ntribution £3.854b. 36 It's likely to increase. In late 2003 French EU com missioner Pascal Lamy called for a Euro-tax, an EU tax or levy to fund th e running of the EU. This would be on top of what businesses already pay to t heir government.

It had now become clear that under the new constitu tion Britain would be expected to surrender control of its North Sea o il reserves to the EU. Both BP and Shell wrote to Blair urging him to stan d firm against the EU.

The EU could control Britai n's oil tax, licensing, security of supply, and regulation of pipelines as well as transfer British oil reserves to other EU states in an energy crisis . An inexperienced Blair has delivered the UK to \"Roc kefellerites\" by implementing \"Rockefellerite-Rothschildite\" devolut ion policies. Foreign rule will be imposed on a country that ruled a quar ter of the world at the beginning of the twentieth century. A partition into 12 Euro-regions that have tax-raising powers, the abolition of Engl and, and the annexation by \"Rockefellerites\" of all remaining oil and natur al gas resources in the North Sea will set the seal on national extinction. The consequence of all this for Britain was that th e majority of Britons did not want to join the euro and, if faced with th e choice of \"full integration with euro\" versus secession, tended to favor secess ion. They may be right. The internationalist \"Rothschildite\" Blair is doing a Gorbachev, breaking up the UK by devolution so that American oil compan ies will be able to export its assets of oil and gas. 37 There are claims from groups that guard English sov ereignty that an armed militia of 20,000 men is ready to fight Bruss els on behalf of the English nation. 38 Maybe they're exaggerating.

This has been the driving force behind many of the events of the last 20 years. Gorbachev In March 1985 on the death of Chernenko, a young an d reform- minded Freemason 39 called Gorbachev became General-Secretary of the Communist Party. He started the process that will e ventually see Russia and Europe together. In 1984, around the time he became a Grand Orient F reemason, Gorbachev had met Otto von Habsburg, Pretender to t he thrones of Austria, Hungary, and the Holy Roman Empire and an MEP fluent in some 40 European languages. Habsburg was supremely well qualified to speak for Europe. It is said 40 that the two made an agreement that if Gorbachev came to power he would release four East European nations to the West (East Germany, Poland, Hungary, and Cze choslovakia), and in return Habsburg would uncouple Europe from the US b y promoting an integrated European Union. Europe's uncoupling from the US was plain for all to see during the second Iraq War of 2003. One of his first acts 41 after assuming the leadership of the USSR was to permit Zionist Jews to leave Russia for Palestine, a \"Rothschildian\" policy, and to permit the return of Grand Orient Freemasonr y (and therefore of revolution) to Russia - where it is still a forc e. His talk of economic restructuring (perestroika) and openness (glasnost) in due course came to be seen as adopting decentralized capitalism and de mocracy. In 1986 he met Reagan at the Reykjavik Summit and proposed dra matic cuts in long- range missiles; more followed in 1988. Following the Syndicate ambition to combine Eastern and Western Europe into one United States of Europe, which had been worked out by Bilderberg and the Trilateral Commission, Gorbac hev began to dismantle the Soviet Empire from within.

There was civil unrest in the USSR and Gorbachev us ed military force to suppress ethnic strife in the Central Asian republi cs and forced Lithuania back into the Soviet fold. In 1990 he was elected P resident of the USSR and he abolished the Communist Party's monopoly of political power, opening the way for the legalization of political p arties. At the end of 1991 he stepped down from power, toppling Communism with the Masonic words, \"I hereby discontinue my activities at the p ost of President of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. We're now livi ng in a New World!\" 43 Mikhail Gorbachev, during a visit to London, on Mar ch 23, 2000 described the European Union as being \"the new Euro pean Soviet\" (reported in the London Daily Telegraph's Peterboro ugh column, March 24, 2000). It has been a long-term covert Soviet ai m to establish \"Europe from the Atlantic to Vladivostok.\" This partially c oincides with the current pan-German hegemony from the Atlantic to the Urals. Meanwhile the European Union collective now coordinates two strat egies within it: the ongoing covert Soviet strategy of pursuing a \"Europ e from the Atlantic to Vladivostok\" (i.e. Soviet hegemony from the Atlanti c to the Pacific); and the parallel pan-German strategy, which has not cha nged since the days of Hitler and is still continuing, of pursuing a \"Euro pe from the Atlantic to the Urals.\" The combination of these two strategies in \"the new European Soviet\" isolates and corrals the former Moslem Sovi et republics into an \"arc of Islamic extremism.\" 44 Gorbachev's talk of \"openness\" (glasnost) and \"rest ructuring\" (perestroika) had now turned into the collapse of the Soviet Empi re in Eastern Europe and of Communism itself and the introduction of dem ocracy. There would soon be little to choose between the right-wi ng policies of the Eastern European nations, who now embraced the free market and private ownership, and the left-wing policies of the Wester n European nations.

Gor bachev was linked to \"Rockefellers,\" the Syndicate, and the Bilderber g Group all along, and to French Grand Orient Freemasonry.

Yeltsin In 1995 at the Gorbachev State of the World Forum h eld in San Francisco, Brzezinski, the co-founder (with David Rockefeller) of the Trilateral Commission, said: \"We cannot leap into world govern ment in one quick step ... The precondition for eventual global ization is progressive regionalization.\" 46 Gorbachev had half-done what the Syndicate wanted. He had dismantled the totalitarian structure of the Soviet State (a p ractical meaning of perestroika) and he had brought in representational democracy (a practical meaning of glasnost). But he was being slow in free ing the Soviet economy from the grip of centralized State direction and in handing it over to private entrepreneurs and a free market of the Western Euro pean kind. He had kept the Soviet Union together as a single state. The Syndicate, the CFR, and the Bilderberg Group en visaged Western Europe and the USSR merging into one vast free mark et. There were obvious benefits in replacing Gorbachev with a man who would carry the revolution forward - and allow \"Rockefellers\" to bu y up huge chunks of the USSR. This meant splitting the USSR into region al blocs. To the Syndicate, Boris Yeltsin must have seemed ju st their man. A Communist, he had been made Mayor of Moscow in 1985 ; Gorbachev had known him for some years.

Gorbachev lingered on for four months, trying to pr eserve the USSR as a single state without using force. Only seven of the 12 republics appeared at the twice-postponed opening of the USSR parliament, and Belorussia and Ukraine declared the USSR dead.

Slobodan Milosevic called for a Greater Serbia (an echo of Yeltsin's Greater Russia) that would re turn the Balkans to their pre-1915 borders and include Croatia, which has ric h oilfields. The Serb aim was to seize as much territory as possible, dri ving out Croatians and Moslems - this was the origin of ethnic cleansing - so that eventually the UN could be called in to \"adjudicate\" and award all land held by Serb nationals to Serbia. Civil war broke out, and Yugoslavia was broken up i nto statelets that would be more cooperative. The aim was to effect th e US occupation of Kosovo to guarantee the flow of Caspian oil. With a third of ethnic Serbs living outside the Ser bian republic, Serbia resisted the break-up of the Federation, removed th e autonomy of the Kosovo province, and opposed independence in Sloven ia and Croatia. In June 1991, the Yugoslav federal army moved into Slo venia and in July fighting spread across Croatia. The US and EC were focusing on the Gulf War, and could not give the problem their undi vided attention. After lengthy diplomatic efforts fighting stopped in Slov enia in September. In 2001 work began on a $1.2b, 92ok-long trans-Balk an pipeline due to be operative in 2005.

The pipeline is being built by the US-owned Albanian-Macedonian-Bulgarian Company (AMBO). The p ipeline will be guarded by KFOR according to its commander Gen. Mic hael Jackson.

But at the very time when the US and Britain were running out of their o wn oil, many of their main oil suppliers - countries like Saudi Arabia an d Iraq - had become politically unreliable, and could no longer be take n for granted.

And now that the Great Power rivalry of the Cold War had ended, the post-Cold-War New World Order run by the US was in a position to impo se it by Syndicate interventions. The New World Order The term \"New World Order\" was first used in the mo dern media by New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, who was quoted in AP (July 26, 1968) as saying \"he would work toward international creat ion of 'a new world order.'\" In the AP report Nelson Rockefeller pledge d that \"As President, he would work toward international creation of a ne w world order.\" In fact he had called for world federalism in his The Futur e of Federalism, 1962, claiming that current events compellingly demanded a \"new world order\" as the old order was crumbling. \"There will evolve the bases for a federal structure of the free world.\" In 1967 Richard Nixon echoed this call for a New World Order. In the October 1967 issue of Forei gn Affairs, the CFR journal, Nixon wrote of nations' dispositions to ev olve regional approaches to development needs and to the evolution of a \"new world order.\" 2 The roots of the New World Order can be found in th e French Revolution, the storming of the Bastille in 1789 that was organ ized by the Illuminati within the Grand Orient under the Duke of Orleans a s I have shown in The Secret History of the West, and culminated in the b eheading of Louis XVI. The 200th anniversary of this revolutionary act was celebrated on March 30, 1989, 3 when President Mitterand (then the most powerful 3 3rd-degree Grand Orient Freemason in Europe) 4 unveiled a glass pyramid designed by the American architect I. M. Pei outside the Louvre . 5 The pyramid is an Il- luminati symbol found on the American Great Seal an d dollar bill above the tag \"Novus Ordo Seculorum,\" \"Secular New Order,\" as we have seen. It was clear to all who took part in the ceremony that the purpose of the New World Order was to finish the business begun by the Illum inatist French Revolu- tion: to bring about a universal republic that woul d rule the world. This re- launching in Paris of the New World Order called fo r by Nelson Rockefeller in 1968 was swiftly followed by Gorbachev's pulling down of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989 - and the tearing down of the I ron Curtain.

President Bush made a number of references to the N ew World Order in January 1991. In an interview in US News & World Report (January 7) he said: \"I think that what's at stake here is the New World Order. What's at stake here is whether we can have disputes peace fully resolved in the future by a reinvigorated United Nations.\" In a pre ss conference (January 9) he said: \"[The Gulf crisis] has to do with a New World Order. And that New World Order is only going to be enhanced if thi s newly activated peace-keeping function of the United Nations proves to be effective.\" In a televised address (January 16) he said: \"When we are successful, and we will be, we have a real chance at this New World Order, an Order in which a credible United Nations can use its peace-k eeping role to fulfill the promise and vision of the UN's founders.\" In th e National Security Strategy of the United States (August 1991) issued by the White House and signed by Bush, he said: \"In the Gulf, we saw the U nited Nations playing the role dreamed of by its founders ....

He was asked a question by a reporter: \"You have talked several times about basing the future on a New World Order. Can you give us a definition of a New World Order, and if it depends on the collaboration between the Soviet Union and the United States, how do events in the Soviet Union affect this concept?\" Bush replied: \"W ell, it doesn't depend entirely on it, but it would be greatly enhanced by a Soviet Union that goes down the line with its commitment to market re form, to private ownership of land, to a free economic system, to a system that resists, and does not use force to assure order amongst the repu blics, that goes farther down the road with elections, and all the openness that I give President Gorbachev credit for ....

In either case, disputes over oil have driven event s in the twentieth century. The Syndicate has intervened continuously in the af fairs of nation-states to move the world to global government, leveling the E uropean Empires and crushing the independence of smaller nations. Actin g in conjunction with US diplomacy, they have managed Eastern and Western Europe in such a way that they have both been leveled sufficiently t o meet within a broadly socialist Europe. At the same time, on the fringes of Europe and further afield, the UN and NATO have been used successively as a world army to carry out leveling procedures against dictators in the Middle East, Africa, and the Balkans. The two parallel policies of the S yndicate have prepared nation-states for world government. The first Iraqi War demonstrates an increasing momentum on both counts. The reason i s - the world is running out of oil. The Arabs tried to exploit this shortage. OPEC In 1953 an internal US document 11 declared, \"United States policy is to keep the sources of oil in the Middle East in Ameri can hands.\" However, by the 1960s most Middle-Eastern countries had gain ed a measure of independence, and OPEC (the Organization of Petrole um Exporting Countries) was founded by Venezuela, Iran, Saudi Ar abia, Kuwait, and Iraq. Since then the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, N igeria, Libya, Algeria, and Indonesia have joined. During the 1950s product ion exceeded demand and oil prices sank.

The oil companies overc harged some $2b during 1973-4. 12 OPEC profits were invested in special high interest 20- and 30-year certificates of deposit in American banks. Huge amo unts of OPEC money, multiplied by the methods of fractional reserve ban king (in which a one billion-dollar reserve expands into more than $30b in loans) were then loaned by the American banks to developing countrie s so that they could afford oil at the new price. This was known as petr o-dollar recycling. For example, Standard Oil bought $1b worth of crude oil for its refineries from Saudi Arabia, who then placed that money in Chase M anhattan Bank, which was partly owned by \"Rockefellers\" who also o wned Standard Oil. Chase Manhattan then loaned the money to developing countries, and received many multiples of $1b (the original cost o f the crude oil). 13 The large oil companies are now making huge profits .

Through the influence of David Rockefeller and Kiss inger he was allowed to go to Mexico. 18 Immediately both Iranian and South Arabian oil exp orts were cut, and oil prices soared. The resulting ener gy crisis in the US contributed to the fall of President Carter.

Kuwait had been founded in the eighteenth century. In 1880 the British Government made Emir Abdullah al Salem al Sabah its representative outside the southern border of Iraq, near where the Rumaila oilfields had been discovered inside Iraq. In 1899 al Sabah ceded to England and British Petroleum land inside Iraq, including part of the R umaila oilfields, which he had no right to do. 28 In 1915 - after the building of the Berlin-Baghdad railway - the British invaded Iraq and set up a man date in North Iraq and a puppet regime under King Faisal of Syria in Basra and South Iraq. 29 In 1923 Britain had to agree to grant Iraq independ ence when Iraq joined the League of Nations, to the anger of the o il companies. Iraq became independent in 1932. In the same year the Mo sul oilfields were discovered, and in 1935 British Petroleum built a p ipeline from there to Haifa (in modern Israel). 30 In 1961 Abdul Karim Kassem claimed that Kuwait was Iraqi, as the Ottoman Empire itself had recognized for 400 years. In 1965 Britain granted Kuwait independence, which meant that Kuwait could not be given back to Iraq and that Ira q's claims could be ignored. The British ruled Kuwait through the al Sa bah family for another 30 years. 31 Saddam was trying to recover part of the Rumaila oi lfields - the north Rumaila field produces 750,000 barrels per day, the south Rumaila field 500,000 bpd - and to seize the al-Burqan oilfields in Kuwait itself, the second largest in the world. 32 Saddam Hussein was a criminal before he entered pol itics and had been on the run after attempting to assassinate the dictator Abdul Karim Kassem. According to Richard Sale, intelligence cor respondent for UPI, Saddam was recruited by the CIA in 1959 to do this, following Iraq's withdrawal from the anti-Soviet Baghdad Pact in 195 9. 33 This withdrawal prompted Allen Dulles, CIA Director, to say that Ir aq was \"the most"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"126 The Syndicate dangerous spot in the world.\" Sale wrote that Sadda m lost his nerve and began firing too soon, killing Kassem's driver but only wounding Kassem in his shoulder and arm.

He now milked Iraq for his family and ran a brutal regime based on torture and execution: on one estimate three millio n Iraqis were executed after 1968, and Saddam may have been responsible fo r two million of these. 34 Saddam modeled himself on Stalin and admired Stali n's treatment of his Russian people. He used chemical weapons on the Iraqi Kurds to avenge their collaboration with Iran. Saddam had nevertheless been a good friend of Ameri ca. His relationship with the CIA intensified after the start of the Ira n-Iraq war in September 1980. The US were alarmed at the extremism in Iran, and courted him as an ally. During the 1980s the \"Rockefellerite\" Syndicate thr ough US diplomats had encouraged 35 Saddam to abrogate the 1975 agreement with Iran an d send his armored units into south-west Iran, thus p recipitating the Iran- Iraq war, which was to weaken both sides and set ba ck their respective drives for nuclear weapons so that they would not b e a threat to British and American oil interests or to Israel. It was als o to keep the British and American oilfields out of Iraq's and Iran's grasp. Henry Kissinger said at the time, \"The ultimate American interest in the wa r is that both should lose,\" and throughout the war Israel supplied Iran with at least $500m worth of arms a year. 36 In July 1985 Reagan authorized Israel to sell TOW anti-tank missiles to Iran, and in January 1986 app roved direct US arms sales to the Khomeini government in Iran. 37 During the eight years of the Iran-Iraq war, each side lost a million men. 38 Did \"Rockefellerites\" who organized the overthrow o f the Shah in the hope of securing Iranian oil also arm Saddam Hussei n in the hope of securing Iraqi oil?

In November 1989, allegedly in response to this nuc lear test, the CIA Director met the head of Kuwaiti State Security and promised US cooperation if Kuwait pressed Iraq on the border di spute, thus taking advantage of Iraq's deteriorating economic position . 42 A memo of this meeting was later seized by the Iraqis when they in vaded Kuwait, and was angrily shown to the Kuwaiti Foreign Minister a t an Arab Summit meeting in mid-August 1990. 43 Both US Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Pau l Wolfowitz stated that the US was committed to defending Kuwait.

In April he called for a pan-Arab tro op build-up; if the Arab states remained weak, he claimed, they would never expel Israel from the occupied territories and establish a Palestinian st ate.

Bush warned Saddam to leave Kuwait by February 23. Saddam did not comply. The ground attack was launched on February 24. On t he 25th Saddam gave the order for withdrawal from Kuwait.

In fact, some of the Iraqi-owned Rumaila oilfields would now be unofficially within Kuwaiti territory; Iraq had in effect lost some of its territory to Kuwait. By the end of the Iran-Iraq wa r, Kuwait had accumulated 900 square miles of Iraqi territory by advancing it s border with Iraq northward. This was presented to Iraq as a fait acc ompli and it gave Kuwait (and the Syndicate) access to the Rumaila oilfield. The Kuwaiti Sheikh had bought the Santa Fe Drilling Corporation of Alh ambra, California for $2.3b, and used its slant-drilling equipment to gai n access to the Iraqi Rumaila oilfield. The first Iraq war was fought to control the Rumaila oilfields. Saddam tried to take back the 10% Kuwait i oilfields and effectively lost full control of the Iraqi-owned oilfields. Kuw ait had been accused of slant-drilling in the 1980s and would now have grea ter access to Iraqi oil - and so, presumably, would the Syndicate. It looks as if Saddam was lured into seizing Kuwaiti Rumaila oil: the US, through A pril Glaspie, professed to have no opinion on inter-Arab conflict. 57 The decision came as a great shock. The road to Bag hdad was open, and Saddam could have been taken prisoner. A friend ly successor regime could have been installed. It was rumored that Sadd am had agreed to make a payment to have the war stopped. 58 A figure of $2b was mentioned. To whom was payment supposed to have been made?

Saddam c ontinued to function with Russian support, and found ways of avoiding im plementing the next 12 UN resolutions, which demanded reparations and imposed UN inspection teams on Iraq so that weapons of mass de struction could be destroyed. Most of Saddam's weapons of mass destruc tion were probably destroyed - no one knows for sure - but Saddam seem s to have encouraged the belief that he still retained some, fearing an attack from Israel which he had Scud-attacked during the war. Saddam's defia nce meant that the Iraq War of 2003, if not inevitable, was always a p robability. A year after the Gulf War Saddam was more firmly in power than ever before. But the West had obtained access to a signi ficant part of the Rumaila oilfields by unofficially expanding the boundaries of Kuwait after the war. 59 As a result Kuwait, which has heavy American and Br itish oil-company investments, was able to double its pre-war oil out put. America had won a victory that had laid to rest the Vietnam defeat, and there was a feeling of pride and unity throughout the US that had not b een felt since 1945. But the decisive action was not repeated when Iraq attacked the Kurds and Shi'a, or when Serbia attacked Croatia and Bosn ia - which were not oil-rich states. UN sanctions imposed on Iraq in August 1990 remaine d in force until 2003. They were tied to Iraqi compliance with Secur ity Council Resolution 687, which requires the demolition of Iraq's weapon s of mass destruction and compliance inspections at 60-day intervals. The sanctions could not be lifted until there was unanimity among the Security Council's permanent members. The US and Britain have remained firmly op posed to lifting them. Iraq's sufferings were slightly alleviated by UN humanitarian aid and, since 1996, the Oil for Food Program, which permitt ed Iraq to resume oil exports. Sanctions have caused massive migrations f rom the south of Iraq to Baghdad, inflation, unemployment, and a huge ris e in child mortality.

Osama's Yemeni father had emigrate d from South Yemen to what would become Saudi Arabia around 1930 and had some 54 children by 30 wives. He made a fortune in const ruction, renovating the royal palaces, improving the mosques of Mecca a nd Medina - and rebuilding al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem. Osama bin L aden's mother was Syrian and he was born a Saudi-Arabian, his father' s seventeenth son. According to one view (despite having some 53 broth ers or sisters with a claim on his father's wealth) he inherited $300m when his father was killed in an air crash in 1967. The family company was then run by Osama's eldest b rother Salem (who was 10 years older than Osama). Salem turned t he core construction business into an international conglomerate that em braced industrial and power projects, oil exploration, mining, and teleco mmunications. Salem was killed in 1988 when an ultra-light plane he was piloting inexplicably turned right instead of left during take-off and cr ashed into power lines in San Antonio, Texas. The family company is now run by another of Osama's brothers, Bakr, who is Chairman of the Saudi Binladen Group (SBG) w hich by the mid- 1990s was worth $5b and employed 37,000 people. SBG projects include renovating and reconstructing airports (in Cairo an d Aden), constructing suburbs (in Cairo), hotels (in Amman), and a seasid e resort (in Latakia, Syria). The family has also built a mosque (in Kual a Lumpur), a thirty- story office building (in Riyadh), and a $150m base for 4,000 US soldiers in Saudi Arabia (built after Osama organized the bo mbing of US troops in Riyadh and Dhahran). There are also businesses that manufacture spare car parts and manage resorts in Saudi Arabia, own p roperty in Dubai, distribute drinks and cars in the Middle East, prod uce books in Arabic based on Disney feature films, distribute hamburger s, and that have been involved in a mobile phone venture. The family cont inues to maintain and renovate the mosques at Mecca and Medina, having ex panded them so that they can hold up to a million worshippers each . 2 The financial assets of SBG are managed by the Carl yle Group, which was created in 1987 and now oversees a portfolio wo rth $12b.

James Baker (Secretary of St ate under George Bush Sr.) is an advisor, and the Carlyle Group is repres ented abroad by George Bush Sr. and John Major, former British Prime Minis ter. 3 According to a report in the Wall Street Journal an d other reputable sources, in the 1970s Salem was a business partner of George W. Bush before Bush Jr. became President, and co-founder wi th him of the Arbusto Energy oil company (\"arbusto\" means \"bush\" in Spani sh) in Bush Jr.'s home state of Texas. 4 The position is unclear. The two are reported to h ave been connected through Bush Jr.'s friend from the T exas Air National Guard and neighbor, airplane broker James R. Bath o f Houston, who represented at least four wealthy Saudis as busines s agent. The story is that Bath put up $50,000, channeling the money (via the Bank of Credit and Commerce International) of two Saudi sheikhs, K halid bin Mahfouz and Salem bin Laden, and receiving a 5% interest in Arbusto '79 and Arbusto '80, limited partnerships controlled by Geo rge W. Bush. 5 (When on the point of going bankrupt, Arbusto was bought by Spectrum 7, which in 1986 was in turn bought by Harken Energy Corpora tion; which kept Bush Jr. on the board for his contacts, mainly his father, and put James R. Bath on its board apparently as a representative of Salem.) 6 Was Bath's investment on behalf of Salem bin Laden or others, or was it a personal holding? The White House has made an unsourced deni al. So bin Laden is an international pariah accused of masterminding the September n attacks, yet one of his brothers was a business partner of Bush Jr. in the 1970s and his family's assets are s till represented abroad by Bush Sr. - a combination of circumstances that b emuses. Bin Laden: Recent History Between 1979 and 1989 Osama helped drive t he Russians from Afghanistan, making grenades from landmines and she lls from rusty tin cans.

He attended a meeting at the Hilton Hotel in Sherman Oaks, California. The American Free Press claims that the CIA brought him to the US. He was accompanied by an American businessm an identified as Ralph Olberg, who was procuring American weapons an d technology for the Afghan rebels. The two men met a retired FBI to p executive (Senior Special Agent), Ted Gunderson, who has revealed the meeting, and a CIA explosives, armaments, and computer electronics expert named as Michael Riconosciuto. \"Osman\" (bin Laden) sat in si lence throughout the 90-minute meeting. In 1989 bin Laden founded al-Qaeda, which would eve ntually merge with Ayman al-Zawahiri's Jihad group (which planned the assassination of President Anwar Sadat of Egypt in 1981). 7 Mohammed Atta, the alleged ringleader of the hijackers, was a pupil of Zawahir i's at university. Al-Qaeda was run like a multinational holding company that c an operate without its Chief Executive, and had an independently organized shadow structure in Europe that made individual terrorists very hard to trace. When the Russians withdrew from Afghanistan Osama r eturned to Saudi Arabia but fell out with the royal family ove r Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. Known to want to rid Mecca, Med ina, and Jerusalem of non-Moslems, Osama wanted Saudi Arabia to expel Americans and side with Saddam. He was utterly disenchanted when Saudi Arabia invited the Americans in and opposed Saddam in the Gulf War. In 1991 Osama fled to Sudan, vowing to overthrow corrupt Arab governments like the House of Saud and establish a new, pure theocracy in the Ara bian peninsula. 8 In Sudan Osama created a business empire by investi ng in banks and agricultural projects, and by building a major road . At the same time he organized training camps to train al-Qaeda follo wers in paramilitary tactics.

(\"Jay\") Rock efeller IV. 10 From Sudan Osama waged war against America with att acks on US troops in Saudi Arabia, US warships off the Yemen, and the US Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, causing hundreds of deaths. He was expelled from Sudan in 1996 and returned to Afghanistan foll owing a car bomb in Riyadh that was blamed on him. 11 At this stage, Osama's financial dealings had becom e something of a mystery. Osama's share of his father's estate was $ 300m according to some sources, $35m to others. In 1994, according to a fo rmer al-Qaeda member, he was saying he had lost all his money; there was some sort of a financial crisis. When Sudan expelled him in 1996 he may have lost as much as $150m in assets he was unable to take with him. Nev ertheless, when he arrived in Afghanistan in 1996 at the invitation of Younus Khalis, he gave the Taliban millions of dollars for construction pr ojects round Kandahar: for a large mosque, a dam, and agricultural project s. 12 In Afghanistan he was supported by Younus Khalis, w ho later became a major figure in the Taliban in Jalalabad, and who se military commander (Awal Gul) held the road that led to the al-Qaeda b ase in the White Mountains, Tora Bora (a network of caves and tunnel s accessible only on foot). The fanatical Moslem Taliban regime swept to power in late 1996. Mullah Omar was bankrolled by Osama (to the extent of £68m according to an American intelligence estimate), 13 sheltered him in gratitude for his financial support and for his achievement in helpin g to expel the Russians and gave him control of large areas of Nangarhar pr ovince as a gift. This eastern province between Kabul and Pakistan's North -West Frontier province has many poppy fields. Afghanistan produce s three-quarters of the world's supply of opium, the basic ingredient o f heroin, and Osama now had all the drug revenues from the poppy-rich p rovince. 14 Osama established training camps there for 2,000 te rrorists, at which Clinton ordered cruise missiles to be fired in 1998 . It was at one of these camps in Afghanistan that he met Mohammed Att a personally in December 1999. 15 He had 11,000 trained fighters in 50 countries rou nd the world, and between early 2000 and July 2001 spe nt $800,000 a month on buying small arms and ammunition from stoc kpiles within the former Soviet Union.

According to papers filed in a $1 trillion lawsuit in America in 2002, senior members of the Saudi royal family, deeply wo rried by Islamic fundamentalist attacks on a US army training facili ty in Riyadh in November 1995 and on the Khobar Towers barracks in June 1996 (in which 19 US airmen died), paid at least $20om to Os ama's terror group and the Taliban in return for an agreement that his organization would not attack Saudi Arabia. This \"protection money\" wa s arranged following meetings in Paris in 1996 and in Kandahar, Afghanis tan, in July 1998, both of which Osama attended. This protection money covered some of his expenditure after 1998. 17 Al-Qaeda, initially a guest, became a cuckoo and to ok over the Afghan nest, successfully demanding that Mullah Omar shoul d rename the country \"The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.\" In Fe bruary 2001 bin Laden is alleged to have planned to kill all 625 Eu ro-MPs and hundreds of officials by releasing sarin gas (nerve gas) into t he European Parliament building in Strasbourg, using Algerian proxies fund ed by his source fund. The plot was foiled by German police, who made a nu mber of raids. 18 Bin Laden's Responsibility The Washington Post of December 23, 2001 reported t hat the CIA paid a team of Afghans to track bin Laden for four years. The article says that the CIA had their eyes on bin Laden most of that time, but that just before September 11 they lost track of him. Bin Laden conveniently appeared on a video broadcas t by al-Jazeera, the Arabic satellite station in Qatar, to insist that \" the war against Afghanistan and Osama bin Laden is a war on Islam,\" suggesting that he was the leader of all Arabs, not the \"corrupt regimes\" he has ofte n criticized, such as Saudi Arabia. He praised the attacks on New York an d Washington and said that their perpetrators were martyrs who have gone to Paradise. His support fell short of admitting responsibility for the attacks. He said the attacks took place because of American support for Israel, and that there would be no peace until Palestine is free. He compl ained that a million of Iraq's children had been killed. The Arabs must throw the Americans"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"The Middle East Rebellion 141 out of Arab territory - which meant expelling Jews from Israel and all Americans from the Middle East, the \"Arab nation.\" In his video, speaking confidently and clearly expe cting to win, bin Laden made three historical allusions. He called for \"a n ew battle, a great battle, similar to the great battles of Islam, like the con queror of Jerusalem.\" He was referring to Salah-ad-Din Yusuf ibn-Ayyub, or S aladin, the Kurdish- born Moslem leader who liberated Jerusalem from the Crusaders in 1187. Bin Laden was speaking as if he were a new Saladin who was trying to widen the war to cover all Islam: \"I envision Salad in coming out of the clouds carrying his sword, with the blood of unbeli evers dripping from it.\" He also said: \"What America is facing today is a li ttle of what we have tasted for decades. Our nation, for nearly 80 years, had t asted this humiliation.\" He was referring to the break-up of the Ottoman Emp ire during the First World War, which ended Moslem rule over Jerusalem i n 1917 and the loss of Palestine in 1922. He also referred to Moslem Sp ain: \"Let the whole world know that we shall never accept that the trag edy of Andalusia would be repeated in Palestine.\" From the eleventh centur y the Moslems were gradually driven out of Spain, and Moslem cultural superiority was eroded by the conquest of Ferdinand and Isabella in 1492. Calling for jihad (holy war), bin Laden invoked the Crusades: \"The crusader forces became the main cause of our disast rous condition.\" Pope Urban II urged in 1095: \"Enter upon the road to the Holy Sepulcher, wrest that land from the wicked race .... God wills it.\" Bin Laden was echoing such religious fanaticism a millennium later. With Mullah Omar, the Taliban leader, reinforcing h is call for a holy war, Arabs and Pakistanis flocked to Afghanistan and wer e sent to the front line whence Afghans, who might defect to the Northe rn Alliance, were withdrawn. The prospect loomed of a war between the Arabs and Israel, and perhaps even between Pakistan and India (both n uclear powers). In December 2001 an attack on the Indian parliament by Kashmiri militants linked to al-Qaeda left 14 people dead. The prospec t of nuclear war seemed close. It was said that 12 million might be killed and 7 million critically injured. 19 On November 3, 2001 bin Laden, perhaps sensing that the Americans were closing in on him, appeared on another video s muggled out to Qatar and denied that there was any evidence linking Afgh anistan (or himself) to the attack on America of September 11. He accuse d the UN (which"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"142 The Syndicate had supported the American bombing) of being a \"too l of crime against Moslems,\" and said that Arab leaders who seek UN he lp (such as the Pakistani leadership) are infidels. With Pakistan's religious leaders urging Pakistanis to volunteer for jihad (holy war) agains t the wish of Pakistan's military dictatorship, he was clearly trying to spl it the Global Coalition in the hope that Pakistan (and possibly Saudi Arabia) would insist that the American bombing should be stopped. Bin Laden's denial was compromised by a training vi deo for al-Qaeda followers. In it bin Laden said that the Twin Tower s were \"legitimate targets, they were supporting US economic power.\" T he people known to have died in them were \"not civilians\" but were wor king for the American system: \"supporters of the economic power of the US who are abusing the world.\" The Twin Towers were thus icons of Amer ican power. This video was taken as an admission of responsibility f or the attack on September 11. The War 20 The American response was as the perpetrators could have predicted. President Bush Jr. proclaimed the attack the first act of war in the twenty- first century, and there was talk of an incident wo rse than the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The Americans declared war on world terrorism (a gl obalist agenda) and Bush refused to make public the evidence he had against bin Laden. Following a round of frantic diplomatic activity du ring which British Prime Minister Blair visited Pakistan and India, on October 7 American and British forces retaliated by striking al-Qaeda training-camps and Taliban military installations in Afghanistan. Ther e were air attacks on Kabul, Jalalabad, and Kandahar. It was announced th at 15 bombers and 25 strike aircraft were used, and that 50 Tomahawk cru ise missiles were fired from submarines.

Al- Qaeda fanatics executed 470 Taliban for planning to defect so as to escape the siege. Bin Laden's military chief, Mohammed Atef, who was thought to have planned the September 11 attack and the attacks on the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, was killed in a bombing raid on Kabul. An abandoned al-Qaeda safe house in Kabul allegedly revealed pla ns to manufacture the biological poison ricin together with printed matte r about the building of an atomic bomb. Kunduz fell after a siege of two weeks. The captors discovered that, though surrounded, of the 600 al-Qaeda hardliners s ome had been airlifted out with their weapons by Russian Antinov planes at 2 am, on three successive nights, between bombing raids and under the noses of the Northern Alliance and under the scrutiny of Ame rican Awacs planes.

In September 2002 two al-Qaeda men claimed to have masterminded the September 11 attacks: Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, t he uncle of Ramzi Yousef who is now serving a life sentence for attacking the World Trade Center in 1993, and Ramzi bin al-Shibh, a Yem eni citizen from Hadramawt, the hometown of bin Laden, Khalid's aide and a former flat- mate of Mohammed Atta.

It transpired that bin al-Shibh had masterm inded the September 11 attacks by sending coded instructions on the Intern et to the hijackers via Atta, posing as Atta's German girlfriend. They referred to the targets as university departments. The World Trade Center was the \"faculty of town planning\" (Atta's academic specialty). It later emerged that bin al-Shibh was to have pilo ted a fifth plane on September 11. He applied to take flying lessons wit hin the US but was unable to obtain a visa. After four unsuccessful vi sa applications he settled for an organizational role. In February 2003, the Kuwaiti-born Khalid Sheikh Mo hammed, al- Qaeda's no. 3 who was suspected of masterminding th e September 11 attacks as bin Laden's military advisor, was arrest ed with Mustafa Ahmed Hawsawi, the alleged financier of the attacks, in R awalpindi, Pakistan. They had apparently been betrayed by the son (Mohammed A bdul-Rahman) of the Egyptian convicted of planning the first bombin g of the World Trade Center in 1993, Sheikh Omar Abdul-Rahman, the \"blin d cleric.\" Khalid had a bounty of $25m on his head. According to an i nterview he had given to al-Jazeera, it was he who dreamed up the idea of flying planes into the WTC towers. Khalid is alleged to have told his inte rrogators that bin Laden was responsible for recruiting the hijackers. * * * The case seems clear cut.

September n was the anniversary of September 11, 1683, when the conquering armies of Islam were thrown back from the gates of Vienna, a humiliating defeat from which the Ottoman Empire never recovered and w hich allowed the Western Christian powers to dominate the Moslem wor ld. 21 Bin Laden (if he was involved) and the hijackers who planned to d ie were presumably seeking to reverse a period of Islamic history that began with this date and were signaling that Arab Islam would again move aga inst the West. Intelligence sources also believe that some of the terrorists - many of the 19 hijackers who were to overpower passengers a nd crew - passed through bin Laden's camps in Afghanistan. Evidence for bin Laden's personal involvement in the September n attacks is strengthened by reports of a personal meeting Mohammed Atta (the al leged ringleader of the hijackers) had with him in Afghanistan in Decem ber 1999. Film has surfaced showing four of the hijackers planning the attacks, studying a map of the Pentagon, and reading their wills. It is thought that bin Laden's voice can be heard in the background, off camera. On March 11, 2002 President Bush Jr., in a speech m arking the six months since the September 11 attack, made it clear that he was trying to reassemble the international coalition for the next stage of the war against terrorism. On the same day Vice-President Dick Chen ey and British Prime Minister Blair raised fears that weapons of mass de struction - nuclear and biochemical weapons - might fall into the hands of terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda. In signaling forthcoming action agains t Iraq they suggested that Saddam might supply al-Qaeda with nuclear or b iochemical weapons with which they could attack America.

At a time when al-Qaeda was a ubiquitous danger and oil-rich Saudi Arabia's support for the West was deemed unreliable, Iraq's huge oil reserves wer e tempting. The 2002 Bilderberg Group's meeting in Virginia had recogniz ed that a UN tax on all world citizens would be resisted, and had consi dered a world tax on oil at the wellhead instead. Military action against Ir aq was a way of achieving this. Western oil companies have long had their eyes on I raq, which has 11% of the world's known oil reserves. Huge new reserve s have been discovered in the south (which is dominated by Shia Moslems li nked to Iran). US Vice-President Dick Cheney, who like President Geor ge W Bush had his own commercial interests in the Middle East before holding office, said at the beginning of August 2002 of Saddam: \"He sits on top of 10% of the world's oil reserves. He has enormous wealth being generated by that. And left to his own devices, it's the judgment of m any of us that in the not too distant future he will acquire nuclear weap ons.\" If Saddam were toppled, the Western oil companies, led by Exxon, w ould have access to Iraq's oil reserves and become less dependent on Sa udi oilfields and the future stability of the Saudi royal family. To put it more starkly, the American way of life is dependent on 20 million barrels of oil per day (19.7 million to be exact, a quarter of the world's consumption of oil), and half has to be imp orted (some, despite UN controls, from Iraq, resold as low-sulfur Syrian oil). Until recently the two main suppliers (recently overtaken by Canada) w ere Saudi Arabia, now considered unreliable, and Venezuela, unstable as a result of permanent demonstrations to oust President Chavez. Since Sept ember 11 the US had made approaches for oil to Russia and African natio ns, but the cheapest alternative was Iraqi oil as it sits just below the desert sands. Facing its most chronic shortage in oil stocks for 27 years as a result of the loss of 1.5 million barrels per day of Venezuelan production an d with net liabilities to the rest of the world of more than $2.3 trillion , America desperately needed reserves of oil at minimal cost. In early 20 03 America doubled its import of oil from Iraq. Russia (in five oilfields) and France (in two) made oil deals with Iraq, and both countries consequentl y initially opposed a Western attack on Iraq."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"148 The Syndicate In early September 2002 Cheney said, \"The risk of i naction [is] far greater than the risk of action.\" The Bush administ ration seemed to have taken a decision to effect a change of regime in Baghdad at a cost estimated at $80b (to be recouped from reduced futu re expenditure on oil). The leader of Britain's internationalist gove rnment, Blair, supported this Bilderberg line, citing the threat of Saddam's weapons of mass destruction, which had been developed in breach of nine UN resolutions: Iraq had not fulfilled 23 out of 27 demands. He pro mised that a dossier of evidence on Iraq would be published within a few we eks. He said that Iraq was just as much an issue for Britain as for Americ a, and urged the US to seek a Security Council resolution to justify milit ary action. America had seemed ready to \"go it alone\" and attack Iraq witho ut UN approval, risking being accused of what many felt would be an illegal act. (Any leader who declares that another nation is terrorist and then attacks it risks being accused of a criminal violation of international la w.) At a summit at Camp David, Bush and Blair agreed to topple Saddam by military means even if the UN did not pass a res olution authorizing the use of force. Saddam was reported to be buying North Korean ballistic missile technology to carry weapons of mass destruc tion to their targets. It was claimed that he had enough chemical and biol ogical weapons to wipe out everyone on earth, and that he was on the verge of having nuclear weapons. He could assemble an atomic bomb \"within m onths\" and was close to a nuclear capability. He was reputed to ha ve a $3b-a-year fund to finance al-Qaeda terrorists. What was the balance o f concern here between Saddam as a threat and Iraqi oil as an opportunity to be grasped? You'll have to decide. UN On September 12, 2002 President Bush went to the UN General Assembly and called Saddam \"a grave and gathering danger.\" T here was unease that if Saddam was attacked, he would fire nuclear weapons at Israel, and that if Israel attacked back, the Middle East could become an inferno. If he fired ICBMs at the US, there could be a global i nferno. Saudi Arabia decided to allow British and US planes to launch ai r strikes from its soil if they received UN authority.

UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan had married into th e Bilderberg Wallenberg 23 family, which dominates Sweden's industry and econ omy. His wife, the Swedish Nane Lagergren, was a niece o f the diplomat who went missing at the end of the Second World War, Ra oul Wallenberg. Annan relied on an elite of \"neutral\" Swedish diplo mats to oversee the globalist agenda in places such as the Balkans and Iraq. In January 2000 a Swedish diplomat, Hans Blix, was appointed the ne w chief weapons inspector and head of UNMOVIC, the new inspections regime for Iraq, and John Stern Wolf, was appointed as a special adv isor to the President and secretary of state for Caspian Basin Energy Dip lomacy, to serve on a College of Commissioners for UNMOVIC. On September 20, 2002 Bush's administration announc ed a new post-September 11 foreign policy doctrine that emph asized pre-emptive action against \"hostile states\" and terrorist group s alleged to be developing weapons of mass destruction, to defend American int erests rather than the old priorities of deterrence and containment. T he US, the doctrine insisted, would never allow its military supremacy to be challenged as it was during the Cold War. This ambition seemed to be in conflict with the internationalism of the UN, and indeed seemed t o assert that the UN would no longer have a role if it did not pass a to ugh resolution on Iraq. On November 8 the UN Security Council unanimously ( by 15 votes to nil) approved a resolution \"bringing the civiliz ed world together to disarm Saddam Hussein.\" It authorized the use of fo rce without the need for another resolution, and gave Iraq until Novembe r 18 to comply and December 11 to provide a complete declaration of al l its weapons of mass destruction. The inspectors were to start work in I raq by December 26 and report to the Security Council by February 24, 2003.

The UN Special Commission concluded that 26,000 liters of anthrax might be unaccounted for, together with 1,200 liters of botulinum toxin and 5,500 liters of Clost ridium perfringens.

Iraq had not accounted for quantities of VX nerve gas and ma ny parts used in the manufacture of nuclear bombs. Part of the West's concern was that they thought th ey knew Saddam had these weapons because they had been involved in fin ancing and supplying them. It was revealed by the Washington Post that t he US's arch-hawk in advocating going to war with Saddam, Donald Rumsfel d, as an envoy of Reagan had secret meetings with Saddam in 1983 to a rrange for the Iraqis to receive billions of pounds in loans to buy weapo ns for his war with Iran.

The assistance is alleged to have been given a year after the UN had passed a resolution calling on countries not to supply arms to either s ide in the Iran-Iraq war. According to the Washington Post in the mid-1980s, following the Rumsfeld visit dozens of biological agents includin g anthrax were shipped to Iraq under license from the US Commerce Departme nt. It has been alleged on television that Saddam's 11,000-page dec laration included a laconic section listing all the American companies that supplied these biological agents during the 1980s - and that these pages were omitted from the 5,000-page edited version supplied by the US (which had charged itself with both the copying and distribution of Ir aq's declaration) to such countries as Syria.

The UN Fails to Act In his New Year message for 2003 Blair said that Ir aq posed a threat that demanded the ultimate sanction of \"defensive a ggression.\" In other words, the West must attack him first to defend its elf. Many Western citizens were now perturbed to discover that, havin g spent much of their lives on the \"good\" side, having regarded the Anglo -American alliance as a defensive force for good against Hitler and then, with NATO, against Soviet aggression in Budapest and Prague, they were now on the side of the aggressors, \"the baddies.\" Although Orwellian N ewspeak presents aggression as defense, many Western intellectuals f elt that their regime's policies were now morally ambivalent at best, and m orally compromising at worst. On January 16, 2003, following information supplied by American and British intelligence, the UN weapons inspectors sea rched a large group of bunkers in a relatively new ammunition storage area and found 12 empty 122mm chemical warheads (warheads designed to carry chemical warfare agents) that were \"in excellent condition.\" They ha d not been included in Iraq's 11,000-page declaration and their discovery suggested that Saddam had not been sincere in what he had declared.

In addition 380 rocket engines illegally smuggled into Iraq were missing, along with manufacturing equipment that could be us ed in making a nuclear bomb. Blix was told that he must report bac k to the Security Council by February 14. Seizing on Blix's report in his Sta te of the Union (actually State of the World) address, President Bush declare d that thousands of Iraqis were moving the missing missiles, chemical w eapons, and mobile germ warfare units ahead of the UN inspectors' visi ts. He said that Saddam was not disarming but deceiving, and that only war would disarm him. He announced that Secretary of State Colin Powell woul d be laying evidence linking Iraq to al-Qaeda before the UN. A day after Nelson Mandela made a scathing attack on Bush, claiming that all Americ a wanted was Iraqi oil, Bush received Blair at the White House and agreed t hat if Saddam did not disarm war would follow in weeks. A second UN resol ution (sought by Blair) would be desirable but was not necessary. On February 5, 2003 Colin Powell (drawing on a new and since discredited British dossier) made a dramatic 75-minute presenta tion to the UN of declassified satellite pictures of chemical weapons and facilities being sanitized, and of communications intercepts of Iraq i officers ordering the concealment of weapons programs. In one of thes e an Iraqi officer gave instructions for all references to \"nerve agen ts\" to be deleted.

Iraq was conti nuing to attempt to obtain nuclear weapons components, including specia l magnets needed for a centrifuge system, and was developing missile s with a range of 1,200 kilometers and planes with a range of 500 kilometer s to deliver chemicals or germs. Prisoners were used as guinea pigs for ch emical and biological agents. Powell's powerful presentation failed to pe rsuade key members of the UN Security Council to back military action to disarm Iraq, but it had an impact on world public opinion, much of whic h tentatively swung behind a US attack on Iraq. In February 2003 the UN weapons inspectors found a banned al- Samoud 2 missile system, which, independent experts ruled, could fly beyond the permitted 150k range and threaten Israel . Iraq was given until the end of the month to destroy the 100 to 12 0 missiles, which, with their diameter of 760mm instead of the original des ign's 750mm and the 600mm permitted by a UN letter of 1994, could be ad apted to contain two Volga engines instead of one. The two engines could carry a larger payload (1,000 kg, sufficient to transport a nuclear device ) or convey it a longer range and certainly put Israel (300k away) well wit hin reach. The Iraqis destroyed more than thirty of these missiles in the course of March. The UN weapons inspectors also found an R400 bomb that had been banned and may have contained biological weapons. Blix reported again to the Security Council on Marc h 7 in balanced, neutral terms, praising Saddam for cooperating and glossing over his failure to account for chemical and biological stocks he wa s known to possess in 1998. Kofi Annan, the UN's Secretary-General, then warned that military action in Iraq without international backing from t he UN would be illegal. This was a judgment on his part. Frustrated at the prospects of further delay, and aware of Blair's difficulties with his p arty, the \"Rockefellerite\" Rumsfeld declared that the US was ready to launch a war without Britain. To him, the US's superpowerdom was the main reality in world power, and the UN had marginalized itself and been reveale d as a diplomatic souk in which competing big powers offered bribes to tin -pot dictators of small countries (like Guinea) with appalling human rights records, to secure their votes.

The truth of the situation was that in consequence of the \"Rockefellerite\" Blix-Annan-Chirac line, the US and \"Rothschildite\" Britain had difficulty in carrying the second resolution, which was abando ned. They embarked on military action on the strength of resolution 14 41, which many interpreted as being without UN approval. According to Peter Foster, a convicted conman and f ormer boyfriend of Blair's lifestyle advisor Carole Caplin, in April 2 002 Bush Jr. told Blair at his Texas ranch that he had decided to go to war in Iraq - a year before it happened. If this is true, Blair's case for war had been a justification for a decision made by Bush Jr. a year before the second Iraq war. In view of the diplomatic difficulties, a plan for which Bilderberg would have preferred to have multilateral endorsement bec ame unilateral. The \"Rockefellerite\"-\"Rothschildite\" Bilderberg des ign on Iraq was implemented and forced through and sugarcoated with talk of democratic self-government for Iraq after the fall of Saddam. \"The New World\" Blair explained in an interview, \"faces a new threat of c haos. If the threats all come together all nations are targets.\" The main th reats to the New World Order, which after the fall of the Berlin Wall had given hope of universal peace and security (under American hegemony), were terrorism and rogue dictators' weapons of mass destruction.

Saddam appeared to survive: a figure purporting to be Saddam appeared on television, wearing battledress, a beret, and ho rn-rimmed spectacles and looking disheveled, to denounce the \"criminal\" raid. On March 21 American and British forces spread up t o Umm Qasr, Basra, and Nasiriyah in the south, and Operation Sh ock and Awe was unleashed on Baghdad by B52S, striking Saddam's pal ace complex and intelligence headquarters in an attack of unprecede nted ferocity involving 1,000 missiles, creating fireballs, mushroom clouds , and a firestorm that"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"The Middle East Rebellion 155 left parts of central Baghdad in flames.

It recommended intimidating an adversary into losing the will to fight. Shock a nd Awe was originally programmed to last eight days. In fact, intensive b ombing would last for no more than a few hours. Even so, the attacks on Baghdad would require a multi-billion dollar (at least $100b, pro bably $330b and perhaps as much as $500b) reconstruction program with contr acts to make a start being awarded to Syndicate companies with links to the Republican Party (including a contract to blow out wellhead oil fire s worth about $50m to Kellogg Brown & Root, a subsidiary of Halliburton, the oil company that used to employ Dick Cheney). There would also be op portunities for the Syndicate to loan money on favorable terms, as in t he case of the Balkan wars of the 1990s. The Americans captured two bridges intact at Nasiri yah and crossed the Euphrates. One tank force made its way to Kut, another remained on the west bank of the Euphrates and reached Kerbala. The tanks prepared a hundred-mile-long line between those two towns to a ttack Baghdad. Perhaps sensing that complete victory would be less quick than he had first thought, President Bush asked for $74.7b (aro und three and a half years of revenue from Iraqi oil) to replace high-te ch munitions, a sum that would cover a month's fighting, and Congress voted to give nearly $79b to the war, foreign aid, and domestic security, of which $63b was to pay for the war. There were suggestions that with post- war reconstruction Iraq could cost the Americans over several years as much as $550b. (The costs of the occupation alone would be $17b a year, with several billions more to be spent on humanitarian assistance.) It was lik ely that such amounts, if allocated, would be raised by borrowing, which w ould further increase the national debt. It was difficult to see how such amounts could be spent without some compensation from Iraq's oil (which ha s an annual revenue of $20b) for incurring the costs of the war.

Although her trade deficit for 200 2, £34.3b, 25 was the worst figure since William III ordered records to b e kept in 1697, Britain had allocated £1.75b for the war on Iraq (later rai sed to £3b). War also seemed to have split Bilderberg into hawks and dove s - doves who wanted the New World Order to be peaceful and secure while they traded with Saddam. It had been announced that the reconstruction of Ir aq would not be run by Gen.

He would act as President, Ki ng, Viceroy, Governor, Vizier, and Sheriff in one. Britain urged that the transitional governing of Iraq by the US-led Coalition should be backed by a UN resolution and that Coalition rule should be as short as possible so that a government of Iraqis could be installed. On April 6 Paul Wolfowit z announced that the interim period before Iraqi self-government would b e at least six months and probably longer, plenty of time in which to all ocate business and oil contracts to US companies. This forecast was later extended to a year. Chaos, and No Saddam From April 5 to 8 US tanks pushed into first wester n, then eastern Baghdad and toppled the 20-foot-high statue of Saddam on a plinth in Firdos Square. The Iraqi people discovered that they were free, and immediately celebrated in an orgy of looting from government bu ildings.

It was later revealed that he had authorized his son Qusay to rob the Central Bank of $1b, which was driven away in three trucks hours before the bombing began , at 4 a.m. on March 8. Since 1981 he had paid France some £13b for arms used in the Gulf War and the Iraq War. At the time of his fall Saddam ha d incurred Iraqi debts to foreign lenders of around $65b.

Two retired Russi an Generals, Vladislav Achalov, a specialist in urban warfare, a nd Igor Maltsey, an expert in air defense, had visited Iraq on twenty o ccasions, the last time when they were awarded medals by Saddam six days be fore fighting began. Former Russian Premier, Yevgeny Primakov, vi sited Baghdad on February 23, 2003 on Putin's orders and met Saddam in one of his palaces to arrange the transfer of Iraq's secret service fi les to Moscow in the event of Saddam's defeat, and to discuss an exit strategy for Saddam and his sons. (He had made a similar visit to Saddam shortl y before the first Iraq War.) In a startling move, the US Total Information Aware ness office (TIA), which spies on US citizens to fight terrorism, empl oyed two former KGB heads, Gen. Aleksandr V. Karpof and this same Gen.

For a war in as remote a country as Afghanistan to have been begun so swif tly, mobilization must have begun with the announcement after just a few hours that bin Laden was responsible. The speed with which the Ame rican retaliation happened must be considered alongside a plan to att ack Afghanistan that Condoleezza Rice had before her on September 10. 3 (The plan may have been a response to a Presidential Daily Briefing me mo dated August 6 2001, titled \"Bin Laden Determined to Attack Inside the United States\" and claiming that bin Laden's \"followers would follow t he example of World Trade Center bomber Ramzi Yousef and 'bring the fig hting to America,'\" and that they were \"casing\" buildings in New York.

Quite s imply, the Bush administration jumped to conclusions and assumed th at bin Laden was responsible without sifting evidence. According to CNN, both President Bush and Vice-Pres ident Dick Cheney have personally intervened and asked Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle to \"limit the congressional investigati on into the events of September 11.\" Cheney made his appeal to Daschle on January 25, 2002. Bush made his request at a private meeting with con gressional leaders on January 29, 2002. Bush asked that the focus should be on \"the potential breakdowns among federal agencies that could have a llowed the terrorist attacks to occur\" rather than on a comprehensive in quiry. According to the American Free Press of July 21, 20 03 Larry Silverstein sold 99-year leases on the Twin Towers shortly befo re September 11 and insured the two properties and their future income against terrorism. He was seeking $7.2b. Silverstein had built WTC-7, the 47-story building that mysteriously collapsed on September 11. This h ad been mortgaged in October 2000 to the Blackstone Group of Peter G Pre ston, Chairman of the CFR and Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Silve rstein had insured the building and received $441m in insurance paymen ts, although the cause of the collapse was still unexplained. The Hijackers There are also doubts as to who the hijackers were. According to a BBC report on September 21, there is a discrepancy betw een the seat numbers of the four hijackers reported in the final despera te words of a flight attendant, Madeline Amy Sweeney, to air-traffic con trol, and the seats of the five Arab hijackers the FBI say were involved, including Mohammed Atta, who is believed to have been the ringleader. Atta's father is adamant that his son was not an Islamic fundamentalist, and claims that he was kidnapped and is still alive, having had his identi ty stolen. Atta had reported his passport as having been stolen long be fore September 11, and it reappeared unburned on top of a pile of rubb le near the World Trade Center, according to Attorney General John As hcroft, although the"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Doubts on September 11: Knowledge in Advance? 161 crash and explosion destroyed the fire-proof cockpi t recorders. The FBI later retreated from Ashcroft's announcement, claim ing that the report of the discovery of Atta's passport was only \"a rumor. \" Was some evidence planted to suggest that Atta was to blame? If Atta was the ringleader, why did he take a conne cting flight from Portland to Boston on the morning of September 11 t hat was scheduled to arrive only minutes before it was time to board the plane that was hijacked? If the plane from Portland had been delayed by a fe w minutes, he would not have caught the doomed flight. Why did he cut t he timing so fine? The FBI have incriminating evidence on Atta, as we shall see, but at least six, possibly seven, of the purported terrori sts are still alive and had nothing to do with the attacks, apparently having h ad their identities wrongly used. Investigations have shown that most o f the Arab terrorists involved, including Atta, drank hard and went after girls in a way that contradicted Islamic fundamentalism. Did the suicid e-terrorists have anti- Islamic lifestyles? Was evidence planted to implica te certain sections of the Arab world as opposed to other nationalities? 4 It has not been widely reported that at 1 p.m. on S eptember 11 the Japanese Red Army, which has hijacked several plane s, called al-Jazeera Television and claimed responsibility for the attac ks, which, they said, were in retaliation for the atomic attacks on Nagas aki and Hiroshima. The only identification of the September 11 hijacke rs by passengers using cell-phones was that they wore red headbands; no me ntion was made of the language, nationality, or appearance of the ter rorists. The Japanese Red Army wear red headbands. Perhaps this claim was false; perhaps the Japanese Red Army were opportunistically claiming c redit for a feat they had nothing to do with, for propaganda purposes. In June 2002, following comments that the discoveri es of letters and documents in their belongings \"proved\" they were \"o n a mission for Allah,\" FBI Director Robert Mueller said that the 1 9 Moslem hijackers had left no paper trail: \"In our investigation, we have not uncovered a single piece of paper - either here in the United States o r in the treasure trove of information that has turned up in Afghanistan an d elsewhere - that mentioned any aspect of the September 11 plot.\" Sui cide notes aside - six left notes, 13 left no notes - no evidence has been found of actual plotting by the 19 or indeed their involvement in the Septem ber 11 plot. It left open the possibility that others carried out the Septemb er 11 attacks, using the"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"162 The Syndicate identities of the 19 Moslem men who have apparently disappeared. It has been claimed (in London's Daily Mail of Dece mber 21, 2001) that there was a plan for two planes to crash into London's Houses of Parliament and Tower Bridge, but that the eight hij ackers heard about the scale of the disaster in the US while waiting t o board the London- Manchester planes, panicked, and fled. One of them, Mohammed Afroze, was held in Bombay after claiming that al-Qaeda pai d for him to train at a flying school in England. According to another source, the Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco, was also supposed to ha ve been a target on September 11. It had been reported (in Le Figaro and on radio Fra nce International, reports covered in London's Times of November 1, 20 01) that bin Laden was treated secretly for kidney disease: that he flew f rom Quetta in Pakistan to Dubai on July 4, 2001, and checked into the America n hospital there with his personal physician and al-Qaeda's second-in-com mand Dr. Ayman Zawahiri. He stayed in hospital for 10 days accordi ng to Le Figaro and was visited by a CIA agent \"who was recognized taking t he main lift in the hospital to go to Osama bin Laden's room.\" The hospital denied that he was a patient there. Ho wever, intelligence sources reported that he was using a dialysis machi ne that was shipped to Kandahar earlier in the year. He could not walk without a stick because of an old back injury, and was reported to be dying of a kidney disease (caused by an attempt to poison him) that had infec ted his liver. It now seems that the anthrax scare, which was link ed to the hijackings and contributed to the hysteria before the invasion of Afghanistan and war on Iraq, had a domestic origin. Genetic testing of samples has since revealed that the source of the spores was probably the US army's Medical Research Institute in Utah, the only known center t o have processed the poison into a fine powder and where the CIA has car ried out bio-weapons research. Were the anthrax letters the work of a lo ne extremist involved in the program, for an unknown motive, and was he perh aps himself killed by the anthrax, hence the cessation of incidents? O r was it CIA/Syndicate related? In March 2002 a biochemical arms expert, Barbara Ha tch Rosenberg, a microbiologist at State University of New York wh o heads the biological arms-control panel of the Federation of American Sc ientists, said that the FBI had a \"prime suspect,\" \"a particular person ... a member of the"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Doubts on September 11: Knowledge in Advance? 163 biochemical community ... a middle-aged American wh o works for a CIA contractor in the Washington DC area\" and had an up -to-date vaccination against anthrax, but was reluctant to arrest this p erson for fear of exposing secret US government biochemical projects and opera tions. The anthrax incidents stopped after Professor Don W iley, a microbiologist of global renown, inexplicably plunged to his death into the Mississippi from Hernando de Soto Bridge, which links Tennessee to Arkansas, on November 16, 2001. It seems that he had unaccountab ly taken a series of wrong turnings, and that he may have been unconscio us when he fell over the side of the bridge as he bounced off the struct ure. It probably wasn't a suicide, as all those have avoided the angled str ucture and have jumped directly into the water. Who was Responsible? Who had been responsible for striking at the heart of American military, financial, and political power? The perpetrators of the attack genuinely wanted to damage America. Maybe, in addition, they wanted to lure America into a retaliation against Arabs/Moslems to cause uproar in the Arab world and another war or jihad (holy war) betw een the West and Islam. Who was capable of organizing such an attack that t riggered such swift Anglo-American retaliation? Who, bearing in mind al l the circumstantial evidence we have gleaned so far, were the immediate suspects? Bin Laden? No elaborate, multi-cave complex was ever found. El even days after the Americans began bombing the Tora Bora Mountains they released another video, apparently found in a house in Kanda har. It showed bin Laden meeting a sheikh, since identified as Sheikh al-Ghamdi, a militant Saudi cleric paralyzed from the waist down, apparen tly on November 9, 2001, laughing as he said that the attack on the Wo rld Trade Center had been more successful than he had expected.

So did six have time to write suicide n otes? And why didn't the other 13 write notes? The tape appeared to be genuine. The video had poor sound quality and looked as if the camera were eavesdropping. The re was no obvious propagandizing about Israel, and the dialogue did n ot appear to have been tampered with. Bin Laden looked healthy. Did h e know he was being filmed? Was one of his sons the amateurish camerama n? Was he putting his thoughts on the record as he was a Moslem icon? If so, why did he confess to responsibility for the attack? Elsewhere he said there was only circumstantial evidence to c onnect him with the attack. Why had he broken his tight security to tal k? Why was there no mention of the war and of the US bombing, which had started a month before November 9? The Pentagon's translation of the Arabic used in th e tape has been found to have been manipulated and is judged to be inaccurate by Arabic language experts interviewed on the German state te levision show Monitor on December 20, 2001. According to one of the exper ts, Dr. Abdel El Husseini, \"At the most important places which have been presented as proof of bin Laden's guilt, the Pentagon translatio n does not agree with the Arabic heard on the video.\" Bin Laden says in t he English version \"We calculated in advance the number of casualties from the enemy\" but the words \"in advance\" are not said in Arabic. In t he Arabic version bin Laden says not \"We had notification since the previ ous Thursday that the event would take place that day\" but \"We had notifi cation since Thursday.\" Notification of what? According to the American Free Press of December 31 , 2001 a specialist in Islamic affairs, Hani al-Sibaei, said that the t ape showed bin Laden being congratulated on the pre-arranged marriage of his child to the child of Ayman al-Zawahiri in 1997 rather than disc ussing the attack. Did clever sound editing string together past words and impose them on a conversation to do with marriage?

Does he seem relaxed and fatter in the face than in the other videos of autumn 2001 because this video was shot in 1997? AI-Qaeda/lraq's Joint Involvement? The link between al-Qaeda and Iraq was tenuous. In an interview with Tony Benn, the left-wing British MP, Saddam said, \"We ha ve no relationship with al-Qaeda.\" But documents found in the destroye d Iraqi Intelligence HQ after the fall of Baghdad and publicized in the British Sunday Telegraph (April 27, 2003) show that Saddam's intelligence ch iefs were seeking to establish links with al-Qaeda in March 1998. An unn amed al-Qaeda envoy traveled clandestinely from Khartoum - bin Laden wa s based in Sudan until 1996 - to Baghdad, and the documents show tha t the visit went so well that it was extended by a week. The relationsh ip was so covert that bin Laden's name was taken out of the documents with wh ite correcting fluid, though it was still readable underneath. It has been confirmed by the Czech Interior Ministe r Stanislav Gross, according to the London Times of October 27, 2001, that a meeting in Prague took place on April 22, 2001 between Atta an d the Iraqi consul in Prague, Mohammed Khalil Ibrahim al-Ani, a very seni or Iraqi agent. It was alleged that Atta in all made four visits to Pr ague to see al-Ani, who was deported from Prague to Iraq in April 2001 for \"activities incompatible with his status as a diplomat\" (in fact, taking a c lose interest in the Prague headquarters of Radio Free Europe, a possible bomb target). It was alleged that Atta was given a vacuum flask of anthrax spore s at his last meeting with al-Ani in Prague (April 22). There have been persis tent denials that Atta ever met al-Ani. The existence of their April 22 me eting has subsequently been denied by Czech President Vaclav Havel, who co ntradicted his own Interior Minister. In July 2001, one of Saddam's intelligence agents, Habib Faris Abdullah al-Mamouri, who had been sent to Rome as headmaster of a school for Iraqi diplomats in Italy, took a holiday with Atta. They were seen together in Hamburg (where his flat-mate was Ziad Samir Jarr ah, the pilot of the plane that crashed in Pennsylvania, who had links w ith a Palestinian terror group run by Abu Nidal and sponsored by Iraq) and P rague.

Perhaps Atta was unaware of his associates' intelli gence links? The attack on September u could in theory have been a shared operation. 5 Intelligence sources believe that half the $500,000 the hijackers used came from al-Qaeda sources. While Mounir al-Motassadeq h as been accused in Hamburg of running the bank accounts of Atta and other pilots and sending them money for flying lessons (for which he was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment), all of this $500,000 has b een traced back to the United Arab Emirates, and Atta received $100,000 fr om money-changers in Sharjah, one of the emirates. The pilot of the s econd plane to hit the World Trade Center also received money from Sharjah . There was clearly UAE involvement in financing the pilots, and Sharja h clearly acted as a conduit that conveyed funds to the West from a sour ce elsewhere that has yet to be identified. The UAE had diplomatic links with the Taliban, and established a free trade area with Iraq in June 200 1. But it seems unlikely that Iraq had a direct connection with it. Israel? It is a strange coincidence that the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center were originally built by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey with \"Rockefeller\" assistance. David and Nelson Rockefel ler were respectively prominent international banker and Governor of New York. David took up a 1946 idea to regenerate Manhattan; he proposed the formation of the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association, which by January 1960 proposed a Trade Center, and Nelson helped the idea through. The Twin Towers opened in 1970 after an eight-year construct ion program. They were then 100 feet taller than the Empire State Bui lding, and were the highest Towers in the world until they were surpass ed by Chicago's Sears Towers and the Petrona Towers in Kuala Lumpur. The North Tower had a 347-foot-high radio tower, which allowed the World Trade Center to retain its claim to being the world's tallest building des pite the completion of the later taller towers. The two Towers in New York wer e originally jokingly nicknamed after David and Nelson Rockefeller, one a fter each brother. The names may have been \"affectionate names\" (nickn ames). 6 These Towers were leased by the Port Authority of New Yor k and New Jersey to Silverstein Properties, the company of a new owner, Larry Silverstein, a"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Doubts on September 11: Knowledge In Advance? 167 prominent Jewish businessman born in Manhattan, two months before they collapsed (on July 24), for $3.2b. They were t hus not connected with the Rockefellers at the time of the attack, althoug h at the level of image they were still historically associated with them. It was revealed by the American Free Press of Decem ber 10, 2001 that an Israeli company, Zim American Israeli Shipping Co., Inc., whose parent company Zim Israel Navigation Co. is nearly half-ow ned by the State of Israel, broke its lease of rented offices on the si xteenth and seventeenth floors of the World Trade Center's north tower at t he beginning of September, as a result of which it lost $50,000. Wa s it tipped-off? This action contributed to rumors that Israel was behind the attack, and that the pilots who carried out the attack were Israelis (Jewish terrorists) who had assumed Arab identities. The American Free Press (December 24, 2001) quotes Horst Ehmke, who coordinated the German secret services under Br andt in the 1970s, as saying, \"Terrorists could not have carried out a n operation with four planes without the support of a secret service.\" Al so Andreas von Bulow, who served on the parliamentary commission that ove rsees the three branches of the German secret service, is quoted as believing that Mossad was behind the September 11 attacks. Its motive? To turn public opinion against the Arabs and boost military and security s pending. It must be observed that on December 3, 2001, citin g the parallels between the most recent suicide-bombings in Jerusal em and the September 11 attack, with Anglo-American support Is rael launched a small war on Palestine, striking at buildings and h elicopters personally used by President Arafat in Gaza City and in towns on the West Bank. In March and April 2002, exasperated that the Pales tinian killers of an Israeli government minister had sought refuge in Ar afat's headquarters in Ramallah, they besieged the building. (The six m en were taken under Anglo-American guard to a prison in Jericho.) By in sisting that Israel was in the same predicament as the US, Sharon seemed to be opportunistically cashing in on America's outrage against terrorists. Reports of Israeli involvement may be strengthened by reports (e.g. in the American Free Press, February 10, 2003) that bi n Laden had access to the Inslaw computer company's PROMIS surveillance s oftware after it was stolen from the US and made available on the Ru ssian black market.

If this is correct, Mossad knew from their monitoring of the PROMIS software w hat bin Laden was planning. Could Israel have \"overheard\" bin Lad en's planning of the September 11 attacks and helped them into action? On December 12, 2001 Fox News with Brit Hume carrie d a report by Carl Cameron, who said (according to the America n Free Press of December 24, 2001): \"There is no indication that Is raelis were involved in the September 11 attacks, but investigators susp ect that they may have gathered intelligence about the attacks in advance and not shared it.\" Cameron was asked, \"What about this question of adv ance knowledge of what was going to happen on 9/11? How clear are inv estigators that some Israeli agents may have known something?\" Cameron r eplied: \"It's very explosive information, obviously, and there's a gre at deal of evidence that they say they have collected. None of it necessaril y conclusive. It's more when they put it all together. A bigger question, t hey say, is 'How could they not have known?' [That is] almost a direct quote [f rom the investigators].\" On October 1, 2001 the American Free Press carried a story that the FBI had arrested three groups of Israeli Jews suspected of working for Mossad who were seen \"acting suspiciously\" and videotaping the WTC disaster from varying angles. In all, 60 Israeli Jews were taken into custody following the terrorist attacks and were held because the FBI suspected that they had material knowledge about the attacks. On anothe r view they faced immigration charges unconnected with terrorism. The re are allegations that an Israeli spying ring operated in the USA wit hout the knowledge of the US authorities and gathered information on the impending September 11 attacks, which the ring did not share with the U S authorities. Israel is said to be America's best Middle-East sou rce on bin Laden and al-Qaeda and regularly supplies intelligence to the CIA (American Free Press, November 12, 2001).

The surfacing of the tape coincided with Sharon's visit to the US on December 2, 2001. The relationship between Bu sh and Sharon was not good, and Bush was still smarting at being accused by Sharon of appeasing the Palestinians just as Chamberlain appe ased the Nazis.

The tape could therefore have be en discussed at the Bush-Sharon summit on December 2.

According to Sherman Skolnick 7 the American CIA knew of the attack on America a week in advance, having been told by Moss ad and the French CIA who had both penetrated the plot. Did the Ameri can authorities know the attack was coming and do nothing? Was that how the planes came to be filmed from all angles as they flew into the Twi n Towers? On May 17, 2002 it was reported that Bush was facin g the prospect of a congressional investigation after admitting that he had received warnings of possible al-Qaeda plans to hijack a US aircraft shortly before September 11. The information was contained in a CIA intellig ence report of August 6, prior to which there was a CIA warning of al-Qae da attacks on June 28 based on material gathered since May, and a warning by Richard Clarke, of the US government's counter-terrorism office, on Ju ly 5 that \"something really spectacular is going to happen... soon.\" Dur ing the congressional hearing in March 2004 Clarke was critical of the ad ministration's failure to prevent the attacks."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"170 The Syndicate The FBI had been told on August 6, 1998 that a grou p of unidentified Arabs planned to fly an airplane loaded with explos ives into the World Trade Center from a foreign country.

The memo left little doubt that hijacked aircraft would be used as missiles against targets within the US, and, according to White House spokesman Ari Fleischer, was headlined \"Bin L aden Determined to Strike the United States.\" An FBI report said th at bin Laden might be sending Middle-Eastern terrorists for pilot trainin g at US flight schools, and that Zacarias Moussaoui, the suspected 20th hij acker, \"might be planning to fly a plane into the World Trade Center .\" Dick Cheney, the Vice-President, and Condoleezza Rice, the National Security Advisor, were also party to the information, which was said by a White-House source (Condoleezza Rice) to be of a general, not a specif ic nature and did not warrant shutting down the American civil aviation s ystem.

Three days after the attacks, according to the New York Times, Secretary of State Colin Powell, De puty Secretary of State Richard Armitage, Under Secretary of State Marc Gro ssman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Senator J oseph Biden, and CIA Director George Tenet, and other members of the Senate and House Intelligence committees, met Lt.

Did these officials meet the Pakistani General in the hope of learning about al-Qaeda?

Fourteen months after the event it was reported in the American Free Press (November 11, 2002) that a US intelligence ag ency, the National Reconnaissance Office in Chantilly, Virginia (about four miles from the runways of Dulles airport), which operates US recon naissance satellites, had planned a simulated security exercise on Septem ber 11 in which a plane would crash into one of the four towers of th e agency's headquarters. The Pentagon and CIA were aware of the planned \"con tingency response\" exercise - which may be why three of the planes wer e unchallenged by fighters. However, the location of the agency was t oo far from the Twin Towers for the exercise to explain why the planes w ere filmed from all angles on September 11. The US government said it was a \"bizarre coincidence\" that this security exercise was planne d for September 11, but the truth may be that the \"game\" was hijacked by ag ents who overlaid it with a lethal scenario.

This was the thrust of the congressional h earing before which Rice testified. Clarke's view was that Saddam was n ot linked with al- Qaeda.

Either they kept the information to themselves, or they told the US CIA in confidence, perhaps in general rather than specific terms, but not the political leadership (Bush). If the latter, the US CIA, privy to this in formation and wanting a pretext to attack Afghanistan and bin Laden, did no thing, but made sure that on September 10 there was a plan to topple bin Laden. Mossad, and perhaps the CIA, arranged for the attack to be film ed (just as 60 years earlier someone with prior knowledge had arranged f or the bombing of Pearl Harbor, which killed 2,300 American serviceme n, to be caught on film to fuel outrage across the US). There was a preconceived plan to invade Afghanistan , before the attack on the Twin Towers. The Syndicate, some of them, kn ew an attack was likely, and that if it happened it would suit their purposes. Osama bin Laden is a pawn in the game rather than some master -evil genius.

Allegedly Gen. Primakov had loaded them onto two former Soviet warships at Umm Qasr and had buried them deep in th e Indian Ocean. Maybe they were hibernating in the Indian Ocean. In early October David Kay, the civilian head of the 1,200-strong Iraq Sur vey Group charged with making an interim report to Congress, found that wh ile the search had been hindered by an elaborate concealment operation , Iraq had probably had no large-scale chemical weapons program since 1 991.

He doubted that the US had any hard evidence that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destru ction as \"practically everything was found and destroyed.\" It is possible that Saddam was bluffing all along - that there were weapons of mass destruction programs without weapons of mas s destruction, to deter the US from invading Iraq.

In 1997 they si gned a 23-year, $3.7b contract to refurbish the huge West Qurna oilfield in Iraq in 1997. In February 2003 Saddam cancelled the deal. The Luk oil vice-president maintained the deal still stood, and threatened to sue for $20b anyone who tried to take over the oilfield, and threatened to arrest tankers which conveyed crude oil in Iraqi waters. (Under the cont ract Lukoil would get half, Iraq a quarter, and the Russian government ag encies a quarter of the field's 667m tons of crude, a $2ob deal - and Iraq still owed Russia $8b for arms.) 3 Putin's budget for 2003 had assumed oil would not f all below $19 a barrel; during the Iraq War oil dropped from $34 to $24 a barrel, and was set to plunge further.

A new Iraqi government could then privatize Iraqi oil by selling concessions to the highest bidders, and Russian and French comp anies like Lukoil who had made deals with Saddam - $40b had been allo cated in contracts - would have to reapply and compete for concessions anew. When the US announced the end of fighting on April 30 it also announced its intention to withdraw its military ba ses from Saudi Arabia, as bin Laden had demanded. This would cut out a pla nk in al-Qaeda's platform. The truth was, Saudi Arabia had become to o dangerous for US troops because of the intensification of Wahhabism. The September 11 hijackers, the Taliban, and al-Qaeda had all emerge d from a single Islamic fundamentalist movement, Wahhabism, which had origi nated in Saudi Arabia. Wahhabism, a puritanical Moslem sect, sprea d in 1744 when Mohammed Ibn Saud, the emir of the region round mod ern Riyadh, married the daughter of Mohammed ibn Abdul Wahhab, founder of the Wahhabi movement. From that time the Saudi royal fa mily promoted ibn Abdul Wahhab's fanatical ideas, and recently Saudi clerics have preached terrorism and financial jihad. Russia responded by wooing Saudi Arabia, holder of the world's largest oil reserves. In September 2003, in a little public ized visit, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler Crown Prince Abdullah visited Moscow fo r talks with President Putin. The oil ministers of the world's two biggest oil exporters were also present. A Russian-Saudi agreement was reached to p rovide Russian gas pipeline building to develop Saudi gas fields. Russ ia now had access to Saudi oil. 4 Saudi Arabia had pulled billions of dollars out of the US and was set to re-invest them in Russia. Russia may hav e severed Saudi backing for the Chechen Moslem Separatist rebels. Russia, h aving lost some of its access to Iraqi oil, had recouped its position by s witching to Saudi oil. \"Rockefellerite\" Russia/Saudi Arabia looked set to be on a different course from \"Rothschildite\"-PNAC US/UK/Iraq. But the prosp erity of both sides was grounded in oil. In June 2004, however, the Saudis were keen to be s een to be pro- American. Alarmed that the beheading of an American hostage in Riyadh might panic Western oil workers into leaving Saudi Arabia en masse, a Saudi spokesman held a press conference in the US to anno unce the shooting of four top al-Qaeda men who had been responsible f or the killing, and to emphasize Saudi determination to work with the US t o defeat al-Qaeda."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Doubts on Iraq: A Military Strategy? 181 Russia had not given up over Iraq.

The plan involved reconstructing the old pipeline that, as we have se en, was built by British Petroleum from the Mosul oilfields to Haifa in 1935 .

The project would require Iraq to reco gnize Israel, an idea to which Ahmad Chalabi, the Pentagon's early choice of ruler of the new Iraq, was committed. 5 The plan was first proposed by Henry Kissinger in 1 975, when he signed a Memorandum of Understanding whereby the US would gu arantee Israel's oil reserves and energy supply in times of crisis. It was proposed again more recently by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. Over the years the cost to the US of supporting Israel has been coloss al. Research by Thomas R. Stauffer, published in the June 2003 issue of Th e Washington Report on Middle East Affairs, shows that since its inaugurat ion Israel has cost the US taxpayer $3 trillion, the largest costs being cause d by a series of oil-supply crises that accompanied the Israeli-Arab wars, part icularly after 1973, and the construction of a Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The $3b reserve for Israel's energy supply in the 2002 US budget would be slashed by the plan. The pipeline would be rebuilt by the Bechtel Company, to which the Bush administration awarded a $680m contract for th e reconstruction of Iraq in mid-April. James Akins, a former US ambassador to Saudi Arabia , said, \"There would be a fee for transit rights through Jordan, j ust as there would be fees for Israel from those using what would be the Haifa terminal.

These bases and the US troops' facilities in Afghan istan would virtually surround Iran.

Was this pipeline the motive for the attack on Iraq from the outset, and were fears of weapons of mass destruction part of a n elaborate deception on the part of both Washington and London? Was the true aim of the Iraq War to establish US military and economic influence in the Middle East? The US occupation of Iraq meant that the US had, in effect, become a member of OPEC (the Organization of the Petroleum E xporting Countries). US control of pipelines across the Balkan peninsula , the Caspian region of Central Asia, and the Middle and Near East would enable America to compete with its biggest, newly industrialized riva l, China. None of this was any consolation for Iraq. Occupation/Restructuring Iraq was broke. Besides owing $65b, perhaps as much as $100b, to foreign lenders, it owed $200b in reparations claims follow ing the 1991 invasion of Kuwait. The cost of the initial reconstruction o f Iraq was estimated at $20b a year for several years by the Council on For eign Relations. In the event, Washington limited its initial funding to $2 .4b in the first phase. Iraq had $383b of international debt (unpaid loans, legal claims, and outstanding contracts), more than any other country , and France and Russia (both owed about $8b), and Germany, refused US requests that they should write off debts owed to them. (We have seen that Russia more- than-halved its debt in return for oil agreements.) Iraq's oil infrastructure needed heavy investment of between $10b and $30b to bring production back to the level of 3.5 million barrels a day in 1 989. If Iraq's oil production could rise to 3 million barrels a day, there would be an income of $27b a year, but $5b would have to be invested in moderniz ing Iraq's dilapidated oil extraction and refinery infrastructure. In the short term Iraq's oil dues would be absorbed by this cost. However, the Center for Global Energy Studies has predicted that with new finds (such as the West Qurna field and the untapped Western Desert) oil production cou ld rise to 8 million barrels a day by 2011 and certainly by 2020.

At the same time, plans by America and Britain to r ebuild Iraq - promises that had been announced - were scrapped after the S panish government revealed that there was a gaping hole in funding re construction. It had been hoped before the war that the sale of Iraqi oi l would largely pay for reconstruction. Figures produced by Spain's Ministr y of Economic Affairs and sent to the World Bank showed that oil revenues would fall short of the reconstruction figure the West originally envisaged , $41b. This was likely to be over $80b over 10 years, and international ai d agencies believed that $250b would be more realistic. In 2002 Iraq pumped $13b worth of oil, but since then wells had been fired by Saddam's tro ops and the cost of renovating and modernizing Iraq's oil industry was, according to Spain's figures, $3.5b. The $2.4b Congress approved for Ira q was thus only a tiny fraction of the amount needed to remedy the chaos c aused by the war. The rebuilding of Iraq was under-resourced and lacking in strategic direction. Defense sources said that British troops could be i n Iraq for four years due to hit-and-run attacks by pro-Saddam militias. Around the same time, the finance ministers for the Group of Seven countries met in Deauville to pave the way for a re structuring of Iraq's $60b-$100b foreign debts. The G7 countries agreed n ot to press for repayment of Iraqi debts for at least a year. Much of the debt was owed to Germany and France, who resisted the write-off poli cy urged by the US. In August 2003 it emerged that America planned to m ortgage Iraq's future oil supplies to pay for expensive post-war r econstruction work. Under proposals promoted by the US Export Import Ba nk and a lobbying group including the American contractors Bechtel an d Halliburton, loans of $30b over 10 years would be made on the security of Iraq's oil reserves, the second largest in the world. Anne Pettifor, hea d of the Jubilee Plus debt relief campaign, said: \"It is outrageous that the poor people of Iraq will be lumbered with billions of dollars of debt t hat will be used to boost the share prices of Wall Street financiers and US c onstruction giants.\" She warned against the coalition \"using the instrum ent of debt to control Iraq,\" pointing out that such a motive would repeat the mistakes made with Germany after the First World War."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"Doubts on Iraq: A Military Strategy? 185 It was revealed that Blair had at least three priva te meetings with Clinton during the Iraq War.

There were now voices suggesting that Britain's fut ure lay with America rather than with Europe. September 11, followed by Afghanistan and Iraq, had changed the post-Cold-War thinking, which, unde r Clinton, held that economic and trade issues should be ahead of milita ry and diplomatic concerns, and that Britain had to find a way of rel ating its economy to a world of four blocs - America, the EC, Japan, and China - through economic links with the EC.

This vi ew is borne out by the attitude of Senator Jay Rockefeller, the Senate Int elligence Committee's senior Democrat and would-be presidential candidate who appeared on television to call for televised hearings into the \"accuracy\" of intelligence used by Bush to justify the war: \"We have found not hing of significance. We went into the war based on the fact that Saddam' s ties to al-Qaeda and weapons of mass destruction were posing an immi nent threat to our country. We need to know if this was accurate.\" Sug gesting that Cheney's many visits to the CIA during the previous year wer e to put pressure on CIA officials to make their assessments fit the adm inistration's policy aims, Senator Rockefeller asked, \"What was he doing there?\" In July 2004, Rockefeller, introducing the Senate's report into t he \"flawed\" intelligence of the CIA, said that Congress would not have voted to go to war had it known of the intelligence shortcomings.

Anglo-American forces had won the war, but they wer e losing the peace. The Iraqi Shi'ite leader, Ayatollah Mohammed Baqer al-Hakim, returned to be greeted by breast-beating crowds of more than a million Shi'ites in the holy city of Najaf. His call for foreign forces to leave and for a Shi'ite Islamic Iran-style state alarmed the US. He was kil led in August 2003 by two massive 1,500 1b bombs outside the Holy Imam Ali shrine in Najaf. Both Jay Garner and Barbara Bodine were reca lled to Washington as being ineffectual. Garner was replaced by L. Pau l Bremer III, a Yale graduate and former diplomat and counter-terrorism expert, who became the new US civilian administrator of Iraq. Until re cently he had served as managing director of Kissinger Associates (Henry Ki ssinger's consultancy business). Bremer swiftly postponed the creation of a 300-memb er national congress to select an interim government that would take over the day- to-day running of Iraq because a body could not be assembled that represented Iraqi society. He then abandoned the id ea. Instead the US would appoint a council of 25 to 30 senior figures across the religious and ethnic spectrum who would shadow the existing US ad ministration. This group would begin drafting an Iraqi constitution. U nsurprisingly John Sawers, Blair's special envoy charged with bringing democracy to Iraq, also concluded that Iraq's political culture was to o weak, and radicals too powerful, to proceed with elections for an interim government. Iraq was simply not ready for democracy. Donald Rumsfeld said that it was possible that Sadd am had destroyed the weapons of mass destruction before the war bega n. This was barely credible and, if true, meant that Saddam had compli ed with the UN resolution. Paul Wolfowitz, the US Deputy Defense S ecretary who had signed PNAC's Statement of Principles in 1997, reve aled that the coalition exaggerated the threat from weapons of mass destruc tion for \"bureaucratic reasons\" before going to war: \"The truth is that fo r reasons that have a lot to do with the US government bureaucracy we settled on the one issue that everyone could agree on, which was weapons of mass destruction as the core reason.\" It was revealed that in September 2002 the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) had said that the re was \"no reliable"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Doubts on Iraq: A Military Strategy? 187 information\" that Iraq had chemical weapons or even the ability to make them. The idea was now openly expressed on television (fo r example, by British MP Tony Benn) that Bush had wanted Iraqi oi l, that he and Blair had thought up a pretext - weapons of mass destruct ion - and that they had deceived the world's public; and that nothing B lair said from now on (for example, on the European constitution) could b e believed or trusted. Clare Short, the British minister who resigned afte r the Iraq War, accused Blair of duping the British public by doctoring int elligence reports - to exaggerate the imminent danger from Iraq. Charitabl e interpretations in the press spoke of Blair's having seized too unc ritically on pieces of intelligence that supported conclusions he had jump ed to, and that he had misled the public. According to the American Free Press of July 28, 20 03 the US Vice- President Dick Cheney was behind one of the decepti ons that pushed the US into the Iraq War. In January 2003 he had ordere d CIA director George Tenet to insert into a speech by Bush Jr. that ther e was \"credible\" British intelligence that in 2001 Saddam tried to buy urani um ore (yellow cake) from Niger, the poor West African nation. Tenet had told Bush the previous October that he could not support this claim, but, the American Free Press asserts, Cheney overruled him. The British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw later told the US that the British government had i ndependent intelligence corroboration of the Niger story. This confirmation later appeared to have come from a French source - Niger was formerly a Fr ench colony - and to have been subsequently discredited. The Kelly Inquiry The pressure on Blair increased dramatically after Andrew Gilligan, the BBC's defense correspondent, reported on the BBC's Today program on May 29 that the September dossier had been \"sexe d up\" against the wishes of the intelligence service by material inse rted by the government, notably that Saddam could \"deploy\" weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes. On June 1 Gilligan asserted in an artic le that Blair's director of communications and strategy, Alastair Campbell, was responsible for this.

David Kelly, the British UN weapons inspector and British government's biolo gical warfare expert and advisor, a scientist and Ministry-of-Defence ci vil servant, volunteered to his MoD line manager that he may have been a sou rce for Gilligan's report and article On July 17 Gilligan was recalled to the Foreign Aff airs Select Committee. Perhaps sensing that Gilligan would contradict his own evidence, Kelly left his home to go for a walk. He did not return. That evening Blair addressed a combined Congress an d House of Representatives and received 17 standing ovations f or his support for the Iraq War. The next day Kelly was found dead on Harrowdown Hil l, Oxfordshire, not far from his home. A packet of co-proxamol pain killing tablets and a knife were found near him. His left wrist had been slit and the post-mortem established that he had bled to death. Kelly's Baha 'i faith, which he had adopted in 1999, forbids suicide. It was very convenient for the British government t hat Kelly had died as it silenced an authoritative voice that had ques tioned the need for the Iraq War and had inferred that Blair had taken Brit ain into war on false pretences. Kelly's death had also eliminated a top UN weapons inspector who had made 37 visits to Iraq up to 1998 (when he was excluded by Saddam) and had knowledge of where weapons of mass destruction might be hidden. His ambition was to return to Iraq as so on as possible and spend the last year of his working life finding the se hidden weapons. One of Kelly's last e-mails named \"many dark actors playing games with my life.\" He may have thought that these \"dark actors\" were national figures. Could the \"dark actors\" have been internat ionalist figures? Blair swiftly ordered a Judicial Inquiry under Lord Hutton to establish the facts regarding Dr. Kelly's death. This absolve d him of the need to answer questions as the matter was now sub judice. The reason for the Iraq"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Doubts on Iraq: A Military Strategy? 189 War was supposed to be outside Hutton's remit. In a sense, the Inquiry was a continuation of the \"deliberate distraction\" from the main issue of why Blair led Britain to war. The suggestion was that Kelly's expertise was in th e past, but in fact he was intimately involved in compiling the war dos sier with the most up-to-date intelligence. He was a biological weapon s guru: he had been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize, and had accompan ied British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw at an appearance before the Fo reign Affairs Select Committee. He was advisor to the top-level task for ce in the MoD, which processed intelligence on all aspects of Saddam's w eapons, and as Britain's leading expert in biological weapons he was crucial to the group's work. It was revealed in the American Free Press (August 4, 2003) that although Kelly was not employed by MI5 or MI6 or any other i ntelligence service he was consulted by the intelligence agencies of Br itain, France, Germany, the US, Japan, and Australia. He knew about the typ es and strains of microorganisms, and the numbers of shells and aeria l bombs filled with botulinum toxin. Kelly was also in charge of the pr ogram to dismantle Russia's biological warfare weapons program under t he trilateral agreement between Russia, the US, and Britain In Moscow he met Russia's top microbiologist, Pasec hnik, who was then director of the Ultrapture Biopreparations Institute in St. Petersburg. Pasechnik told Kelly that he was part o f the Biopreparat, a large secret program which is developing biological weapons like plague and smallpox. Plague (which is propelled by coughin g) had brought on the Black Death that wiped out a third of the popul ation of Europe in 1348. Kelly reported what Pasechnik was doing to MI 6, and weeks later Pasechnick defected to Britain while at a Paris sci ence conference. Kelly supervised his interrogation. Pasechnik was later e mployed in the Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research, run by the D epartment of Health, and he founded a company (Regman Biotechnologies). Kelly often visited him and often took him to Porton Down, entrance to which is restricted to those who have signed the Official Secrets Act. He was found dead at his home near Salisbury, England on November 2, 200 1 - officially of a stroke. Kelly did not attend the funeral. It was then claimed, in the American Free Press of August 18, 2003, that Dr. Kelly had worked with two other microbiolo gists who suffered unexplained deaths and who were, like Pasechnik (an d Dr. Kelly himself),"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"190 The Syndicate experts in DNA-sequencing (a vital element in devel oping biological weapons). In November 2001 Benito Que left his labo ratory after receiving a phone call and was found in a coma in the parking lot of the Miami Medical School; he was found by the inquest to have died of natural causes. A few days later Don Wiley left a banquet f or fellow researchers in Memphis and, after abandoning his car with his igni tion key left in it and the lights left on, plunged off a bridge over the M ississippi River. There was no autopsy, and a local medical examination fou nd he had suffered a dizzy spell, which caused him to fall off the bridg e. Pasechnick was found dead in bed 10 days after he had met Wiley in Bosto n to discuss the latest developments in DNA-sequencing. The American Free Press of August 18 suggested that the deaths of Pasechnik, Que, Wiley, and Dr. Kelly were linked to the deaths of five unnamed Russian - or perhaps Israeli - microbiologi sts whose commercial Siberian Airlines plane was shot down by a Ukrainia n surface-to-air missile while flying from Israel to Novosibirsk in Siberia shortly before October 2001. It revealed that from October 2001 Dr. Kelly was involved in ultra- secret work at Israel's Institute for Biological Re search, and that he had met Institute scientists several times in London du ring the next two years. Israel has not signed the Biological Weapons and To xins Convention, an international treaty that forbids the possession and use of offensive biological weapons and which has been ratified by o ver 140 countries. The American Free Press of August 18 suggested that the Institute had been engaged in DNA-sequencing research. A member of the Knesset, Dedi Zucker, had caused a furor in the Israeli Parliamen t when he claimed that the Institute was \"trying to create an ethnic speci fic weapon.\" Such an Israeli weapon could target Arabs. If dropped in Pa lestine it would attack the genetic structures of Arabs but would not touch Jews. In all, 25 scientists (including Kelly) had died my steriously between 2001 and 2003 - 10 in plane crashes, five after bei ng mugged at home, three after being shot, two as a result of suicide, one after being stabbed, one after being gassed, one after being run over wh ile jogging, and one after falling off a bridge. Had all these microbiol ogists been killed covertly because they knew too much about this \"ethnic speci fic weapon,\" and in Dr. Kelly's case was it feared that he might be \"a source\" on that weapon of mass destruction?

The government had in effect ordered this idea to be deleted, and Scarlett, who had had commanding control of the dossier, transformed the dossier by omission at the non-presentational insistence of the governm ent. This admission was extremely damaging to the government. Scarlett was later appointed by Blair to head MI6. Hutton's Report did not change the public's percept ion that Blair had been \"led up the garden path\" by Bush, and had led his own party and the Conservative Opposition up the garden path, and had found out from intelligence briefings too late that this was the case. Former British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook claimed in his publish ed diaries that Blair had privately confided to him on March 5, 2003 that he knew Saddam had no weapons of mass destruction that would be re ady for use in 45 minutes. If Cook was reporting his conversation wit h Blair accurately and was not distorting it to exact revenge for the events that led him to resign on March 17, the implication was that Kelly was right: Iraq was not \"a real and present danger\" for Britain, and Britai n had gone to war on exaggerated evidence, a circumstance the Establishm ent - some of those interviewed by Hutton - had sought to cover up. A secret file was deposited with the Hutton Inquiry marked \"Not for Release. Police Information Only.\" It was about a t actical support operation by Thames Valley Police, strangely called Operation Mason, which began an hour before Kelly left his house for his last wa lk.

The Saudis then foiled an attempt by three Moroccans to fly a plane into a Saudi skyscraper in a re-run of September 11. It was estimated that there were some 17,000 al-Qaeda operatives still free and ready to act against the West, although Rohan Gunaratna, author of Inside al-Qaeda : Global Network of Terror, claimed that following the Afghanistan and Iraq wars the hardcore members who act directly in the name of al-Qaeda ha d been reduced to about a thousand men. Looser groupings of organizat ions may make up the difference. It seemed that like bin Laden, Saddam was constantl y one step ahead of those trying to capture or kill him. On the eve of the Iraq War, documents originally in the possession of Saddam's half-broth er, Barzan al-Tikriti, which had been copied by the French intelligence se rvice, the DGSE, reached Washington. They suggested that Saddam was benefiting from state-of-the-art US computer software, a tracking p rogram that the CIA and FBI depended on, which had enabled him to avoid cap ture. The software was capable of pinpointing Saddam's and bin Laden's every move, and so they could see themselves as the Americans saw them . According to the American Free Press of July 21, 20 03 President Bush Jr. brought Paul Redmond, America's top spy-catcher , out of his 1998 retirement to investigate how bin Laden and Saddam Hussein obtained PROMIS. He was told to investigate how Robert Hanss en, the FBI computer specialist and long-term Soviet mole, hand ed a copy of the PROMIS software to his KGB controllers for $2m. Acc ording to MI6 and Germany's BND PROMIS, which had been developed by a small company called Inslaw, was installed by the FBI in its head quarters to track terrorists. Hanssen had stolen a copy of the software and hande d it to the KGB. The USSR then used it for computer-based espionage agai nst the US, with great success. After the collapse of the USSR PROMI S found its way on to the Moscow black market, and in a Moscow hotel room a redundant KGB officer approached one of bin Laden's representativ es, who paid $4m for the PROMIS software shortly before the attacks on t he Twin Towers and the Pentagon. Hanssen is now serving a life sentenc e for his treachery. According to MI6 and Germany's BND there is credibl e evidence that bin Laden then sold PROMIS to Saddam and to Kim Jong-Il of North Korea,"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"Doubts on Iraq: A Military Strategy? 193 and used the money he received to finance his alleg ed terrorist attacks on Bali and Kenya in 2002. In mid-July Redmond suddenly resigned due to \"ill h ealth\" - although his health was reported to be fine. According to th e American Free Press, Redmond's findings shocked Bush Jr. for they probed business links involving \"the mobilization of trillions of dollars \" in 1989-91 by Bush Sr. and his brother, Neal. The American Free Press repo rts that documents in Redmond's possession and seen by Christopher Story of the International Currency Review, a London-based newsletter, show th at the PROMIS software was provided to Saddam on the authority of Bush Sr. - at a time when relations between Baghdad and the US were clos e, during Iraq's war with Iran. Confronted with evidence that his fa ther supplied PROMIS to Saddam, Bush Jr. sacked Redmond. Hours after Red mond cleared his desk, Bush Jr. placed a $25m bounty on the head of Saddam, and $15m on each of the heads of his two sons, in an attempt to put an end to the hit-and-run attacks - and to terminate their use of PROMIS. Bush wanted both Saddam and bin Laden \"dead or alive.\" On balance, the West appeared to be winning its war against terrorism. Following Bush's doctrine of pre-emption, the US ha d targeted terrorist groups that possessed a \"global reach\" and any coun try that gave a safe haven to terrorists. In January 2002 the policy was extended to \"terrorists and regimes who seek chemical, biological or nuclea r weapons.\" The US had overthrown the Taliban regime in Afghanistan , uprooted bin Laden's operational infrastructure, killed or captu red many terrorists, and discovered details about al-Qaeda's methods, as a r esult of which more terrorist attacks had been foiled. Israel had begun to build a 370-mile-long, 25-foot-high steel security fence to keep out Pales tinian suicide-bombers. Despite numerous threats there had been no major te rrorist attacks on the West in the two years following September 11. I n Afghanistan and Iraq, which had become an al-Qaeda base and battleg round, thousands of terrorists had been killed and terrorist activities had been disrupted. Bin Laden and Saddam had been forced into hiding and th eir ability to operate had been severely reduced. Saudi Arabia had become the epicenter of terrorist financing, with some of the 5,000 members of the Royal Family bankrolling terrorists.

Under the terms of a UN resolution of June 1, 2004, US and British for ces were to remain in Iraq until January 2006. The withdrawal of US force s would not affect the continuation of the four bases the US would retain in Iraq. Oil The West's policy towards the Middle East meant tha t America and Britain were more in control of the world's oil supplies th an before, despite the frequent attacks on Iraq's oil pipelines. However, from the perspective of the American econo my, issues of security, containment, and ideology were almost irr elevant. The September- 11 attacks made a move on Iraqi oil nearly inevitab le. The American economy had suffered as a result of September 11. A $127b budget surplus was transformed into a $165b deficit in less than t welve months between 2001 and 2002. By July 2003 the budget deficit had risen to $455b (against $304b forecast in February). Bush's 10-year $1.3 tr illion tax cut and the war in Afghanistan (which cost $900m-$950m a month, over $10b a year) both contributed to this result. Peacekeeping was costing a further $3.9b a month, of which around $1b a month could be attributed to Iraq. During this time the US boosted its oil reserves, m aking large payments while increasing the world demand for oil in 2002. US leaders must have found the attraction of seizing Iraqi oil to allevi ate this expenditure very tempting. President Bush's economic advisor Larry L indsey said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that the rem oval of Saddam would be a great boost for the world (and therefore the US) economy, even though a war in Iraq might cost America up to £140b, as in creased oil production in a free Iraq would bring down oil prices. The British economy had also been damaged by the wa r as the initial budget of £1.75b had risen to £3b and was now appro aching £4b, which could have been spent on schools and hospitals.

Was this sale the final proof that the war was to secure oil and other natural resources and assets? Capture of Saddam At 8.30 p.m. on 13 December 2003 Saddam Hussein was captured alive in a targeted operation involving 600 troops follow ing information from either a detainee or from a bodyguard (who may have drugged him). He was found, with a pistol he did not use, down a 6-8 foot deep hole covered by slab, bricks, and dirt in Al-Dawr, 10 miles from his native Tikrit by the River Tigris. (One of Saddam's personal bodyguards, Ma'ad al-Nasuri, later revealed that Saddam had left Baghdad on April 10 i n a white Oldsmobile and reached the environs of Tikrit.) The hole was n ext to a mud-hut farmhouse, and was clearly a hiding place he went i nto when Coalition troops were in the area. He had $750,000 in a suitc ase but no cell-phones or communications equipment. His two bodyguards had run away. He had been betrayed by a tip-off at 10.50 that mor ning. Would the resistance now crumble and give up? He was shown vi deo footage of his crimes. Mass graves had been found. He was set to face trial in Iraq for crimes against humanity and war crimes. (He is estimated to have been responsible for killing somewhere between 1 an d 4.5 million Iraqis). There were calls for him to face hanging. There wer e reports that he was defiant towards his captors but had admitted creami ng off £25b from the profits of illicit oil sales and sending it thr ough bogus companies to Switzerland, Germany, and Japan. He still denied ha ving weapons of mass destruction. So the US forces finally \"got him\" (Bremer's words) . The sight of the pathetic captured Saddam, a broken man with his mat ted hair, unkempt beard, and furrowed (frightened?) brow, looking lik e a tramp, who put up no resistance, and the pictures of his primitive hole demystified his image as a fearless strong man who ruled Iraq by te rror.

Arabs were openly cal ling him a coward and a fraud; the story that he had been drugged may have been spread by Saddamites. Be that as it may, Saddam's dishevel ed appearance and solitary hole confirmed the impression that the US had been after his oil. The US still had to contend with daily terrorist in cidents. In early January 2004 a bin Laden emissary, Hassam Ghul, was capture d in the Kurdish border area bearing a letter from Abu Musab al-Zarq awi (a notorious Jordanian-born terrorist with links to al-Quaeda) o utlining his terrorist operations in Iraq. The Americans put a price of $1 0m on al-Zarqawi's head as the ringleader of the terrorism in Iraq. In early March 2004, after fraught negotiations between Sunnis, Kurds, a nd Shias, the Iraqi Governing Council signed a draft constitution. A fr agile Iraqi government now confronted terrorism with US backing. In April American troops were fighting on two fronts as simultaneous uprisings of Sunnis and Shi'ites evoked memories of the Tet offensive in Vietnam. Terrorist incidents (including beheadings of US hos tages) increased following the revelation that US guards had mistrea ted and sexually abused Arab prisoners at Baghdad's Abu Ghraib priso n. Following the announcement of a 33-member Iraqi government to run Iraq from June 30, 2004 under a Sunni president, Sheikh Ghazi al-Y awer - the US had dumped Chalabi for duping the American administrati on into believing that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction - there were daily car- bombs that killed scores of Iraqis. Sabotage attack s on Iraq's two main pipelines feeding crude oil from storage tanks to o ffshore terminals at Basra and Khor al-Amaya halted Iraq's oil exports ( normally 1.7m barrels a day) in mid-June 2004. Bin Laden offered to treat with European countries who detached their troops from the US forces in Iraq. The Western forc es hoped that al- Qaeda felt near to defeat and were looking for a tr uce in which they could regroup.

Rumsfeld said that Sy ria had conducted a chemical weapons test within the last 12 to 15 mo nths. In fact, Syria, Iran's closest ally for the last 15 years, was rega rded by the Pentagon as the sole Moslem state possessing \"a chemical systems ca pability in all critical elements\" for chemical weapons. Press reports now a ppeared asserting that Syria had refused to sign the chemical weapons convention and had spent $1b-$2b annually on ballistic, chemical, and biological weapons. They claimed Syria could fire any of its 1,000 Scud-C mi ssiles with chemical warheads at Israel, and that at any time Syria coul d make a first strike against Israel's nuclear reactor in Dimona. There w ere claims that the Scud-3 and Scud-4 missiles (range 300 miles and 450 miles respectively) were housed in at least 15 tunnels built with North Korean and Chinese assistance; and that Syria had manufactured aerial bombs with sarin and had thousands of other chemical aerial bombs carrie d by Su-22, Su-24, and MiG-23 planes. Press reports attacked Syria's S cientific Studies and Research Center (SSRC), which was in control of its chemical weapons program. How many of these claims were in the natur e of propaganda to justify an attack on Syria? In early May 2003 it was reported by United Press International that Pentagon plans to expand t he Iraqi ground war to Syria in the form of cross-border raids had been blocked by the White House national security advisor, Condoleezza Rice.

Turkey was to be pressured into allowing its air space to be used by US planes. The aim was to ensure that Iran could no longer pose a threat to Israel.

Many weapons inspectors concluded that Iran was working hard to develop an atomic bomb and would have a nuclear arsenal by 2005. Scie ntists questioned in Pakistan (including Dr. Khan, father of the Islamic bomb) admitted giving Iran crucial technical information on building an a tomic bomb, probably in return for large payments. At a meeting of the b oard of 35 governors of the IAEA, the US argued that Iran should be found i n breach of the nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT). The IAEA gave Iran an ultimatum to come clean on its nuclear weapons program: Iran had 45 d ays to comply. The implication was that there would be UN Security Cou ncil action if Iran refused to comply. The Iranian delegates angrily st ormed out of the Vienna meeting. The US and Israel were reported to be cons idering a pre-emptive strike against the plants at Natanz and Arak (a hea vy-water plant). Following meetings with the foreign ministers of Br itain, France, and Germany, Iran agreed to accept IAEA inspections of its entire nuclear program and to give assurances that it had no plans to develop nuclear weapons under the cover of a project for civil nucl ear power.

They were looking for oil-prov iders who could replace the \"unreliable\" flow of Saudi oil.

The State Departmen t's attitude to the new Afghanistan was summed up by a spokesman (Glyn Davies), who said that the US found \"nothing objectionable\" in the st eps being taken by the Taliban to impose Islamic law. In February 1997 a d elegation of Taliban leaders flew to Unocal headquarters at Sugarland, T exas for corporate hospitality. Unocal opened an office in Kandahar. In May 1997 Unocal, the spearhead for Standard Oil interests, secured a $2.5b pipeline deal with the Taliban, Turkmenista n, and Pakistan. The Taliban made two conditions: that Unocal should rec onstruct the country's infrastructure and that the pipeline should be open for local consumption at some point. From 1997 Unocal was a member (with Birdas) of a multinational consortium, Central Asia Gas (CentGas ), which envisaged a pipeline from Turkmenistan's Chardzhou oilfield thr ough Afghanistan to Pakistan and eventually India. There were reports t hat Unocal offered to pay the Taliban $100m a year as rent for oil and ga s pipelines. Unocal suspended its participation in August 1998 f ollowing the attacks against the US Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and withdrew from the consortium in December 1998 following the US cr uise missile attack against Afghanistan. The pipeline was never constru cted, and Birdas filed a $15b suit against Unocal, which was not suc cessful. The size of the claim indicates the scale of the project.

The US pressured Britai n into giving up Hong Kong in 1997, and the 2008 Olympics have been awarded to China; athletic events will take place in Shanghai. In ret urn China has on occasion taken the US side against North Korea and Saddam. It seems that there was a deal in 1996. China would allow Hong Kong to function as before so that the West would n otice no change of ownership; in return China would be helped with Wor ld Bank investment in developing Shanghai and, to a lesser extent, Bei jing. There would also be help with the $110b required to develop the Yang tze River: $70b for the Three Gorges dam projects and another $40b for the diversion of the Yangtze to the north. The sequence of events behind this contradiction of investment and enmity is as follows: • America agreed to help China's projects (Yangtze an d Shanghai) via intermediaries in return for normality in Hong Kong after 1997; • America was shocked to learn that China had acquire d US nuclear technology through espionage; • America decided to have a missile defense shield ag ainst China to"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"The Pay-Offs 217 be on the safe side, and conveniently the attacks o n September 11 took place to convince the American public that the US needed such a shield; • China has demanded the return of Taiwan by the en d of 2004, and America may be in no mood to grant it following the theft of nuclear information. It can thus be seen that an attempt to democratize Red China has been overtaken by confrontation, following the nuclear t heft. Some advisors to Bush Jr. were reputed to favor regime change in Chi na, a policy linked to their promotion of a global defense shield. It was a measure of China's stunning progress since the early 1990s that in Oct ober 2003 it became the third country (after the US and the USSR) to la unch a man into space. The event may also have been a measure of how much rocket technology China had stolen from the US. It was reported on February 7, 2002 that US militar y might had secured a stronghold in Kyrgyzstan, north of China. Three t housand foreign troops were expected to occupy the Manas air base b y the spring. A Kyrgyz military expert, Alexander Kim, was quoted as sayin g: \"There is one great power in this region which can oppose the US. I don 't think that this base is connected to strategic plains to the south as mu ch as to China.\" Did the Americans see a war in Afghanistan as a pre paration for a missile defense system against China, a system the Syndicat e would help finance? Will such a system defend the US from states that r esist the Syndicate's drives for new oil? North Korea In October 2002 North Korea admitted that it had a secret nuclear weapons program that violated an agreement it signe d with ex-President Bill Clinton in 1994 to freeze its nuclear program. In a stormy meeting US Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly, visiti ng a month after Bush Jr. announced his policy of pre-emptive strikes, co nfronted North Koreans with evidence of their nuclear activities during a visit to Pyongyang, and the North Koreans acknowledged that their program i nvolved enriched uranium, which could be used in nuclear weapons.

The Americans do not know where these weapons are; they are likely to be in one of the 11,000 caves excavated below Pyongyang s ince the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. (There are 15,000 underg round military- industrial sites in all.) North Korea also has 500 Scud missiles and stocks of anthrax, cholera, and plague, and eight chemical production plants for mustard gas and nerve agents. There was concern as the new dictator of North Korea, Kim Jong-Il, had the reputation for being unstable and \"dangerous\" (Chinese leader )iang Zemin's word). There was enormous US concern when in December 2002 the UN seals and surveillance cameras at North Korea's Yon gbyon five-megawatt nuclear reactor 56 miles north of Pyongyang were re moved, the reactor having been shut down in a deal (the Agreed Framewo rk) with the US in 1994. The reopening of the reactor was allegedly to generate electricity, but it was capable of producing weapons-grade pluto nium for nuclear bombs. The International Atomic Energy Agency repor ted that fresh fuel (1,000 uranium fuel rods) had been added to the rea ctor but that no work was being done at the reprocessing plant, which pro duces plutonium. As North Korea has fissile material the reactor cou ld make four or five additional nuclear weapons within months. North Kor ea is developing an inter-continental missile system, which would pu t Europe and North America within range. The US missile defense shield had partly been conceived as a defense against North Korea's missil e program, although until now the program did not warrant a system of t he magnitude of the missile defense shield. In a chilling briefing at t he Pentagon, US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld warned the North Korean r egime that the US military was prepared to take them on at the same t ime as Iraq. He said that the US was able to wage two regional conflicts at the same time: \"We are capable of winning decisively in one and swiftl y defeating in the case of the other.\" As much of North Korea's military co mplex is underground, Rumsfeld has revised the war plan for Korea (\"Opera tions Plan 5030\") and has planned a pre-emptive strike on Yongbyon fo llowed by nuclear strikes against multiple targets.

Oil reserves of 8-10b tons (73 billion barrels if 10b t ons) were claimed in three documents published by North Korea in 1997. 11 North Korea also has gas reserves. Halliburton (the company linked with Chen ey) are involved and say that Korea has significant but quite unmeasured reserves of offshore oil. It seems that since the arrival of Bush Jr. as Pres ident, the US has exaggerated the threat of North Korea, which had pr eviously been contained for nearly 50 years, to help justify the US missile defense shield - and control North Korean oil. The \"Axis of Evil\" On January 29, 2002 President Bush, in his State-of -the-Union address, spoke of the US as being at war with an \"Axis of Ev il,\" a collection of terrorist states, the foremost of which he named as Iran, Ira q, and North Korea. The inclusion of Iran in the firing line followed t he seizure by Israel of a boat full of Iran-sponsored weapons on its way to P alestine. By using the word \"Axis\" Bush was echoing the globalist Axis of Evil during the Second World War - Germany, Italy, and Japan - and signali ng a return to the globalist outlook of the Allies during the Second W orld War. The language used by Bush Jr. subliminally suggested that a new world war (the Fourth World War if the Cold War was the Third) had alread y broken out. His administration let it be known that the war against world terrorism may last for years. Condoleezza Rice told the congressi onal hearing into \"9/11\" that America was now \"at war.\" Action against North Korea may precipitate conflict with China, and provides scope for present ing China as a hostile state that justifies expenditure on a missile defen se system. If such action is planned, then the next World War may already hav e begun, its theatres being the Moslem territories of the Middle East whi ch threaten Israel and Saudi-Arabian oil; North Korea; and perhaps China, where there are huge \"Rockefellerite\" oil interests. It was reported on March 10, 2002 that a Pentagon r eport had been leaked revealing that Washington has contingency pl ans to use nuclear weapons against seven countries: China, Russia, Ira n, Iraq, North Korea,"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"220 The Syndicate Libya (since welcomed as an ally), and Syria. It sh ould be noted that all seven countries are producers of oil or strategical ly important as pipeline terminals. (The Mosul-Haifa pipeline was redirected to Syria.) The report, signed off by Donald Rumsfeld and sent to C ongress on January 8, 2002, stated that nuclear weapons might be used: against targets able to withstand conventional attack; in retaliation fo r the use of nuclear or biochemical weapons; or \"in the event of surprising military developments\" (presumably more incidents like those of September 11). The report envisages nuclear weapons being used in a Chinese c onfrontation over Taiwan; a North Korean attack on South Korea; an at tack by Iraq on Israel or another neighbor; or in an Arab-Israeli conflict . This nuclear strategy and the missile defense system are two sides of the same coin: aggressive and reactive self-defense. Pay-Off Number 3: A World Government The invasion of Afghanistan brought a further poten tial benefit, of world peace. For as a result of the attack on America, a Global Coalition was assembled to conduct a global war for freedom again st world terrorism: a war for civilization against barbarism in which M oslems would fight with Christians against mass destruction. The aim o f the Global Coalition was to line up on America's side as many countries as possible - as many as 60 were mentioned - in a \"New World Order\" to wh ich pan-Arabism is a great threat. Maybe the ulterior aim of the Se ptember 11 attack was to create a global issue, to find a universal cause that would align on the same side and unite the great majority of humankind , to evince a global response. Perhaps globalists used the attack to inc rease global awareness, promote global thinking among all nations, and secu re the victory of the globalists over the nationalists. Crucial to the globalist agenda was the election of Bush Jr. to implement the Syndicate's expansive oil program. His controve rsial election had hinged on 170,000 Florida votes rejected as unreada ble. On September 11, 2001 an investigation was in process. A study, commissioned by a consortium including the Wall Street Journal, the W ashington Post and the New York Times and costing more than £700,000, had reached its final phase: the counting of the votes.

(Gore is, h owever, related to the family of Jacob Schiff by the marriage of his daugh ter to Drew Schiff.) The Syndicate has always used Middle-Eastern potent ates and guerilla leaders as pawns in their grand design. We have see n that although \"Rockefellers\" and \"Rothschilds\" have different emp hases in the Middle East - \"Rockefellers\" being more pro-Palestine, \"Ro thschilds\" more pro- Israel, for example - they both share the same umbr ella, just as the British politicians Blair and Brown (one pro-euro, the othe r pro-pound) make common cause although they differ in emphasis. Maybe the Syndicate is not involved at all. Each in dividual member probably abhors such attacks. But their maneuvering for oil has created the situation where terrorism takes root and flouri shes. The effect of terrorism is to provide them with an excuse to incr ease their grip rather than loosen it. But would we really face terrorism on the scale we do today if there were no commercial Western interests acros s the Middle East? If we left those nations to follow their own destinies ? The way it's turned out, isn't the \"war against terrorism that will last for years\" a convenient way of imposing the will of the world government and of se curing the victory of the globalists over the nationalists? In December 2002 it was announced that Dr. Kissinge r, \"Rockefellers\" and Bilderberg's globalist general factotum, would chair an inquiry into the September 11 attacks (spy agency failures, and avia tion and immigration issues). Kissinger was scheduled to announce his fi ndings within 18 months, at the peak of Bush's campaign for re-elect ion in November 2004. At this stage it could confidently be expecte d that the Syndicate would not feature in the 79-year-old Kissinger's re port, and that there would be a denial of Bush's alleged complicity in t he September 11 attacks, and a vindication of America's war against terror. Two weeks after his appointment, however, Kissinger resigned as chairma n of the inquiry to shield his private consultancy company from controv ersy. Reports stated that he faced intense pressure from Democrats in Co ngress to divulge his client list, which is believed to include some of the world's largest multinational firms and a number of governments.

Welcoming the announcement of a new interim governm ent for Afghanistan that would replace the Taliban, the Bri tish Foreign Secretary said, \"This really is One World.\" Few viewers would have grasped the real meaning of these words, that the New World Ord er had removed a government that was unsympathetic towards globalism , and replaced it with a government that would be internationalist in outlook. The attacks on New York and Washington had the effe ct of advancing the Syndicate's cause of creating a world governmen t that will replace nation-states - an eventuality the North American c ivilization must resist if it is to survive. It should remain in control of its global stage as did Rome during the period of its world imperium, and n ot be dismantled to be ruled by globalists. North American civilization has two enemies. One is Arab extremism and Islamic fanaticism. The other is an enemy within, Syndicate extremism and Masonic fanaticism. Both en emies would merge the North American civilization into a global one f or their own purposes. Conclusion In September 2003 former British minister Michael M eacher, citing the PNAC blueprint, wrote a controversial article c laiming that the US deliberately let the September-11 attacks happen to launch Bush's master plan for world domination. He claimed that the Amer ican plan included regime change in China. There was an outcry from th e US embassy in London and the British press. He was right. The att ack was caught on camera because it was expected. Bin Laden and Sadda m were put up to it by Westerners, they were proxies. It was planned to trigger an attack in return on Afghanistan. In February 2004 Blair said in a speech that the wa r against terror was \"approaching the end of the first phase\" (i.e. \"the end of the beginning\" as"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"The Pay-Offs 223 Churchill said of a phase in the Second World War). It was thought that he was referring to a planned spring offensive agai nst al-Quaeda within Pakistan, to squeeze bin Laden between Pakistan and Afghanistan. This was trumped by a spring offensive against American troops in Iraq. War does not eradicate terrorism. If the criterion for success is eradication, the war against terrorism has failed. Many feel tha t the Islamic militancy has gained in strength, judging by the bombings of relatively soft targets in Morocco, Kenya, Saudi Arabia, India, and Indones ia, and of course Iraq. Bush Jr. probably shared this view in private. In a n abrupt reversal of policy in September 2003 he turned to the spurned and deri ded UN, seeking to extricate the US from its costly post-war plight. W hile the US was asking the UN to share the financial and human burden of r econstructing Iraq, Britain agreed to send 1,400 more troops. Britain a greed to send 3,000 more to support the new Iraqi government after June 30, 2004. Robin Cook, former British Foreign Secretary and la ter leader of the House until he resigned because he disagreed with t he Iraq -War, had concluded at the Foreign Office that containment of Saddam was working. Was he right? Al-Qaeda had come through Afghanistan and its aftermath and had survived. But it was committed to reversing history, to destroying westernization, and restoring a seventh-century Isl amic caliphate, the central idea of the Arab civilization. For al-Qaeda , the source of human perfection is strict adherence to Sharia law and re ligious war (jihad) against the West. Its Utopian perfectibility is a myth, but once the September-11 attacks had shattered the myth of Western invincibi lity and pre-eminence, perhaps the West was powerless to contain the tradi tional beliefs at the core of Arab civilization. It looks as if the US is being pushed by the Syndic ate into a series of conflicts across the globe to strengthen the US eco nomy by seizing oil and to enable the Syndicate to fund a lot of missil es and a global defense shield. The world is turning into a network of oil pipelines, and Western policy is driven by a deceitful imperialism, snaffl ing oil under the guise of seeking terrorists and pre-emptive strikes. Through Bush Jr. the US has played on \"pan-Arabism\" to create an atmosphere of fear, which it has then exploited by presenting the world with a choice between (a) a reign of global terror whose goal is the creation of a series of anti-Western fundamentalist Islamic nation-states; or (b) a war against terrorism followed by a reign of global peace."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"224 The Syndicate The real pay-off is that the threats need to be per petuated so that the world can be \"protected\" into world government.

In June Gaddafi made Dr. Shukri Gh anem, a pro-West ex-deputy secretary general of OPEC, his Prime Mini ster. A team of CIA and MI6 inspectors went in October an d again in December, and discovered that Libya was far more ad vanced in creating a nuclear program than had been realized, perhaps a s a result of links with Iran and North Korea.

The rebels g ained most of the country but were driven back by Angolan, Namibian, and Zimbabwean troops called in by Kabila. In 1999 the Lusaka Acco rd was signed. In January 2001 Kabila was assassinated, allegedly by a bodyguard. He was succeeded by his son Joseph, who agreed to share po wer with Ugandan- backed rebels. In July the presidents of the Congo and Rwanda signed an accord, followed (in September) by Uganda. The civi l war involving seven foreign armies and numerous rebel groups was over. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo's four-year civil war from 19 98 to 2002 at least 2 million, possibly as many as 2.5 million were kille d. 8 In 1997 the UN's refugee agency was ordered to leave, and the Congo military forced Rwandan refugees (Hutus) back across the border, ki lling many. In 2001 a further 80,000 died. In April 2003 there were more massacres and several hundred, perhaps a thousand died according to UN st aff. In 2004 Rwanda's President Kagame told a rally mark ing the tenth anniversary of the genocide that France had trained and armed the Hutu perpetrators, in the full knowledge that they were intent on committing genocide. The French Junior Foreign Minister Renard Muselier, who attended the rally, cut short his visit and flew ho me in protest at the allegation, which Paris strongly denied, claiming t hat the French military had prevented a total genocide. In all 3 million are thought to have died in the Co ngo's Great Lakes region (on Rwanda's and Burundi's western borders) since the 1994 conflict. The problem in quantifying the numbers ki lled in massacres is obvious: no one can have precise knowledge. On anot her view, the total number thought to have died is 4 million. This is n ot far short of the 5 million Jews thought to have been killed under Hitl er. It is hard to disentangle what happened in a region where life is notoriously cheap but at the root of the massacres a pattern can be found: arms sales, a green light, failure by the UN, a cul l of the population, and US control of the Congo's oil.

One word of truth outweighs the world. Alexander Solzhenitsyn's Nobel Prize Speech The Balance of Power within the Syndicate How close are we to world government? The answer to this question may lie in the nature of the balance of power between t he Rothschilds and Rockefellers. Historical Tussle While they steered the world toward world governmen t, \"Rothschilds\" encouraged \"Rockefellers\" to act as an agent of cha nge, a catalyst. It may be that \"Rothschilds,\" who created the Syndi cate to take America over, 1 set up the Federal Reserve to return America to th e British Empire so that it could more easily be controlled. If so, then \"Rockefellers\" did a reverse take-over and tried to run Britain through Germany (their native country): first by manipulating the Kaiser during t he First World War until they put their energies into carrying out the Sovie t revolution through Lenin; then by manipulating Hitler during the Secon d World War; then by manipulating Stalin and his successors into reun ifying Germany; and finally by intriguing a German-centered United Stat es of Europe under which Britain is about to be subsumed. \"Rockefellers\" wanted a German-centered Europe.

The Rothschilds were anti-Hitler and pro-Jew, whereas \" Rockefellers,\" though far from being anti-Jew, were pro-German: they want ed to restore the Thousand-Year Reich in Germany. Hence the reunifica tion of Germany and their insistence that the central bank of Europ e should be at Frankfurt. Their ambition to rule the world from Germany broug ht them into conflict with the anti-German Rothschilds and into a battle for the world's oilfields. Readers who have the conventional account of recent history firmly in mind - that the nation-state of Germany has sought to dominate and rule Europe (or even the rest of the world) and has atte mpted to do this through the Franco-Prussian War, two World Wars, and German y's dominant position in the EU - will naturally see \"an ambitio n to rule the world from Germany\" as another example of \"Deutschland uber Al les,\" for which they will blame \"the Germans,\" and not those exploiting them and their nation- state to achieve their own ends. Similar blame may be laid at the door of \"the Americans\" and \"the British\" following their f oreign adventures in Afghanistan and Iraq. It may be that the creation o f \"enemies\" and \"hate figures\" is a deliberate ploy exploited by the Synd icate to divert people's attention away from their own behind-the-scenes act ivities. The recent conflict between Britain and France may be seen in this light. Grasping this involves realizing that the apparently democratical ly elected governments of nation-states are little more than fronts/puppet s whose strings are pulled by the Syndicate, while their citizens are possibly regarded as little more than \"factory-workers\" in an industry whose output is geared towards the establishment of a world government. In 1945 \"Rothschilds\" wanted a United States of Eur ope and a United States of the World, and used their influence as th e world's bankers on Churchill and (through \"Rockefellers\") Roosevelt an d Stalin to set the post-war world on a globalist course at Yalta and P otsdam. So Churchill, a \"Rothschild\" nominee (through Baruch) 2 and recipient of \"Rothschild\" money in 1938, spoke out at Zurich in favor of a Un ited States of Europe in 1946. As a follower of Coudenhove-Kalergi's Pan Europa, he had written an essay entitled \"The United States of Europe\" in 1930, but in this instance he was speaking for \"Rothschilds,\" not the British Conservative Party which has sought to play down this speech eve r since. \"Rothschilds\" (in conjunction with the early \"Rocke feller\"-funded CFR"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"The Syndicate Today 237 and Monnet) took steps to create a common market in Europe as a half- way house to a United States of Europe.

The Suez debacle, the watershed of the British and French Em pires, was a signal to the colonies that Britain could not defend them and that they could have their independence without a fight. \"Rockefellers\" pressed on towards a communized Euro pean Union with Frankfurt replacing London as the world's financial center. Through their links (originally via Schiff and Col. House) with t he Grand Orient they had links with Gorbachev in Russia and Mitterand in Fra nce (both of whom belonged to the Grand Orient). Meanwhile the City - London, the center of \"Rothsch ilds'\" activities - prospered. Whoever was British Prime Minister had to be at least partly a \"Rothschildite.\" Edward Heath understood this whe n he put Victor, Lord Rothschild in charge of his think-tank.

Bilderberg Meetings 1999 3 The Bilderberg meeting of June 1999 was held at Cae sar Park Hotel, Penha Longa, Portugal and attended by David Rockefeller a nd Henry Kissinger. Its minutes were leaked in the British sub-culture magazine The Big Issue (though hardly an authoritative source) of November 15-21, 1999. They purport to reveal that the Bilderberg Group was adv ised after Kosovo that NATO has given Russia carte blanche to bomb Chechny a. They reveal that NATO is now operating in an environment in which in ternational law has become obsolete, and is in danger of mimicking a co lonial power such as the Ottoman and Habsburg Empires in creating a perm anent protectorate, Kissinger is reported to have said. He pessimistica lly described Kosovo as \"this generation's Vietnam\" as troops could be ther e for 25 years. Britain's Peter Mandelson is reported to have said that NATO can be either an enforcer in an ethnocentric Europe, or the agent fo r the world's cooperating Great Powers. Dollarization (with the US controlling the world's monetary policy) was raised as the next step after the single European c urrency; in other words, the world is to move towards a world currency of a world dollar. According to the report, the Bilderberg minutes also revealed that in Britain it would be easier for welfare cuts to be made by soci alists rather than by Conservatives. Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair attended the Bilderberg meeting near Athens in 1993, and the report suggest ed that it would be easier for (nominally) socialist New Labour, who ar e \"consolidating the victories of the Right,\" to implement the cuts as \" it might be easier for somebody who claimed to be a socialist to impose ch ange.\" If the Bilderberg"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"The Syndicate Today 239 meetings are the backdrop against which policy is m ade worldwide, and if secret policy groups work on what has been discusse d in the more open, talk-based Bilderberg meetings and arrange for them to be implemented as government policy within each nation-state, then from these leaks - if they are accurate - we can gauge the Syndicate's th inking about world population at this present time. 2000 The 2000 Bilderberg meeting for a reduced number of delegates (the so- called \"steering committee\") was held near Brussels at the Chateau du Lac. Having attacked the illegal NATO bombing of Se rbia in the House of Lords when Kissinger supported it, Lord Carrington had either retired or been retired as Chairman of the Bilderberg Group. M artin Taylor (advisor to Goldman Sachs, the largest investment bank in th e world, along with Romano Prodi, President of the EU Commission) acted as Honorary Secretary-General. According to reports in that part of the press that feels able to discuss such matters, during their meeting Bilderberg communicat ed with President Clinton, who was 50 miles away in Aachen receiving the Charlemagne Prize for his contribution to creating the United S tates of Europe. In his speech he urged the EU to write a new Charter or co nstitution (see page 92). At the same time, \"the Convention\" (62 men) we re preparing a new Charter for the EU (which was adopted in Nice in De cember 2000) that turns the EU into a single super-state with an Amer ican-style President and Cabinet as well as a European Parliament and Co urt. It is alleged that Clinton dropped in on Bilderberg in \"private t ime.\" This Bilderberg- Clinton initiative was intended to consolidate a ke y region within the coming United States of the World. From the press reports it seems that oil had again become a Bilderberg weapon to squeeze the West into deflation and reduc e Western aid to the Third World. OPEC was again delivering \"Rockefeller ite\" policy. Between 1999 and 2000 the price of oil trebled from $10 per barrel to more than $35. This price rise had been effected by the Venez uelan President Hugo Chavez, who has influenced OPEC. He has argued that the West should pay more to the developing nations for its oil, and toured Iraq and Libya to lobby for support for reducing oil production so as to increase prices. Chavez's oil minister, Ali Rodriguez, was then Pres ident of OPEC.

At the end of 2001 OPEC cut the worldwide production of oil by 1.5 million barr els a day and pump prices began to rise. As in the 1970s will the rising pric e of oil plunge the West into recession while further enriching \"Rockefeller s\" and \"Rothschilds,\" and demonstrate that talk of a computer-led (i.e. B ill-Gates-led) new era in the world economy is over-optimistic? World deflati on as a result of rising oil prices can only assist depopulation in the Thir d World. 2001 The 2001 Bilderberg meeting was held in Stenungsund in Sweden in May. The American newspaper The Spotlight, reported that the Bilderberg Group was determined that the Western hemisphere (see pag es 43-6) should become a single economic and political entity like the EU, whose member states have already surrendered most of their own s overeignty. In the 10.30 a.m. slot on May 26 Richard Perle spoke on \"Europea n Security, Defense Identity, and Transatlantic Security,\" while in the 4.15 slot Kissinger spoke on \"the Rise of China, its Impact on Asia and the W orld.\" 2002 The 2002 Bilderberg meeting held at the Westfields luxury hotel in Chantilly, Virginia on May 30-June 2 pressed for a \"UN Financial Action Task Force\" to promote a global levy, a world tax b y stealth. It is perceived that a UN tax on all people on earth would be met b y outrage, and so the Bilderberg Group is considering a 10%-per-barre l tax on oil at the wellhead, a surcharge on international travel by ai r and sea, and a charge for cross-border financial transactions. It also wa nts tax harmonization between Europe, America, and elsewhere so that high -tax countries can compete with low-tax nations for foreign investment . The tax rate in the US and other low-tax countries would rise to Sweden 's high-tax 42% level. At the same time - and there is linkage - it is cal ling for the \"transparency\" of all bank accounts and credit cards to a UN agenc y - which means that a Bilderberg-controlled UN agency would be abl e to access all bank accounts and credit card transactions, thus elimina ting financial privacy for all people on earth. It now seems that the 2002 Bilderberg meeting was p erhaps the most divisive ever. The American and European delegates did retain their"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"The Syndicate Today 241 common goal of creating a world government in which the international elite will dominate, but European Union delegates w ere angry that Bush has protected the US steel industry from overs eas dumping and that agricultural subsidies have increased. They we re angry that the US has rejected the International Criminal Court and t he Kyoto Treaty on global climate control, and that American foreign p olicy is so pro-Israel. America's long-planned attack on Iraq was delayed u ntil 2003 in the face of opposition from European leaders. It was reported in Portman Papers (July 2001) that some Bilderbergers (a minority faction) are more interested in corpora te governance than in world governance. To this faction, financial and bu siness interests are paramount and if the financial costs of the EU prov e too high and the loss of nations' sovereignty too great, then Britain sho uld leave the EU and join the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). 2003 The 2003 Bilderberg meeting was held from May 15 to 18 in the Trianon Palace Hotel in Versailles (the French Rothschilds' home territory). The hotel was sealed off with armed guards and all empl oyees were told to see and hear nothing under penalty of being fired and b lacklisted. As part of the security, bewildered residents' cars were towed awa y without warning. The hotel, where the Treaty of Versailles was handed to the defeated Germans, is adjacent to the park or grounds attached to the chateau or palace of Versailles, to which there is normally free access. The entry to the hotel is near the Grille de la Reine, a gate to this palace park. The entrance to this park at the Grille de la Reine, through which the p eople of Versailles are normally allowed to pass, was closed without explan ation.

Royals incl uded Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, the Queen of Spain, and Prince Phi lippe (Crown Prince of Belgium). Jacques Chirac, the French President, delivered a w elcoming speech designed to calm tensions. He pointed out that Amer icans and West Europeans are traditional allies. At the 2002 Bilde rberg meeting Europeans extracted a promise from Rumsfeld not to invade Ira q in 2002. Now some Europeans asked tauntingly, \"Where are all the se weapons of mass destruction?\" And of US plans to control Iraq's oil for the \"benefit\" of the Iraqi people, \"Who are the 'other' beneficiaries?\" On the agenda was the plight of Bilderberg-connected companies based in F rance and Germany that had lucrative contracts supplying arms to Sadd am's Iraq, contracts that had now lost most of their value. Emotions ran even higher on the Middle East peace p lan. Sharon had just dismissed dismantling Israeli settlements in P alestine as \"not on the horizon,\" and in the Jerusalem Post ridiculed any i dea that in consequence US aid might be reduced. (US aid to Israel is norma lly $10b a year. In 2003 Israel demanded $12b because there was less tourism and the economy was depressed.) One European told a grim-faced Amer ican, \"You are too stupid to know when you've been insulted by a m oral midget.\" The will of Bilderberg prevailed and within three weeks Sharon was publicly promising at Aqaba to dismantle the settlements - a fter being threatened with monetary punishments and with having to give u p land Israel acquired in the 1967 war. It is unprecedented for a US president to come under such hostile Bilderberg fire. An independent UN army was also discussed. Some wan ted it controlled by NATO, others (excluding the Secretary-General of NATO, George Robertson) wanted a separate EU force in addition. Europeans urged Britain to embrace the euro on June 9, but it was a ccepted that the British people were opposed and that it would be politicall y dangerous for Blair to do this without a referendum. Also on the agenda was the expansion of the EU to i nclude Russia and all the former Soviet republics (see pages 106-7, 1 17) - a prelude to the EU-Russian summit on May 31 in St Petersburg, where the city's 300th anniversary celebrations were attended by Bush. At a meeting in Yalta with the Ukrainian President, Putin called for a common market linking the"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"The Syndicate Today 243 EU with Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus by September 2003. The prospect therefore was that over half the enlar ged EU would comprise former Soviet territories - all under the new Europ ean constitution and funded by taxation across this Greater Europe. Euro pe would also control oil in the former Soviet territories. The Council on Foreign Relations acts as the propag anda ministry of the shadow world government, and within months produces scholarly papers on the causes discussed at the annual May/June Bild erberg meetings. It is a measure of the extent to which Bilderberg meeting s determine shadow world government policy that Sharon could be prevai led upon to announce a reversal of Israeli policy towards the settlement s. The 2003 Bilderberg meeting effected a U-turn in Israel's policy. It ca n therefore confidently be expected that all the Bilderberg recommendations wi ll be implemented. The Bilderbergers did, however, receive a setback w hen Donald Rumsfeld later announced that the US would not be paying an expected 22% of the $342.4m cost of a new \"futuristic\" NATO headqua rters building in Brussels so long as Belgium claimed worldwide juris diction to try anyone for \"war crimes\" committed anywhere. (Lawsuits unde r Belgian law have been brought against Gen. Tommy Franks, President B ush Sr., Colin Powell, and Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf for their activ ities in the first Iraq War. All could be arrested if they set foot in Belg ium.) At the same time the UN was forced to extend immunity from the Internati onal Criminal Court (ICC) at The Hague to US troops serving on UN-spons ored overseas \"peace missions.\" Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Blair, who had endorsed the ICC at The Hague, found himself facing \"war cri mes\" charges brought by the Greek Bar Association for his support of the US-led invasion of Iraq. It was widely felt that if Blair were convict ed President Bush Jr. may be next. If Blair were to ignore this criminal pros ecution, he would have difficulty in traveling to countries that might han d him over to the court - including Belgium, the seat of the new European U nion of which he onced hoped to be President. It looked as if Blair' s European ambitions would be dogged by Iraq. 2004 The 2004, 50th-anniversary Bilderberg meeting was h eld at the Grand Hotel des Iles Borromees on the lakefront of Stresa , Italy on 3-6 June, and focused on European-American relations. Britain was harshly criticized for"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"244 The Syndicate supporting the invasion of Iraq and for failing to embrace the euro, despite Blair's promise to do so at the 1998 Bilderberg mee ting at Turnberry, Scotland. There was annoyance at the British clamou r to leave the EU. The US was criticized because its foreign aid was a smaller percentage of GDP than that of other nations. Europeans tried to dissuade the US from reducing American troops in Germany. For the t hird Bilderberg meeting running, congeniality gave way to recrimina tions, accusations and divisions. However, all agreed that the UN role in regulating global relations should be strengthened. It was decided that British elites should be urged to press on with full membership of the European Union, despite growing o pposition. It was decided that the Free Trade Area of the Americas sh ould be enacted and include the entire Western hemisphere except for Cu ba, which would join on Castro's departure. It should evolve into \" the American Union,\" a replica of the European Union. It was decided tha t an \"Asian-Pacific Union\" should emerge as the third super-state. The world would be split into three super-states - the American, European an d Asian-Pacific Unions - for the convenience of banking and corporate elites , and the US should facilitate these global trade pacts. It was decided that there would be three global currencies: the dollar for the American Unio n, the euro for the European Union, and another for the Asian-Pacific U nion. All these would of course eventually merge into a world-dollar, and the three Unions would eventually merge into one United States of the Worl d that would mirror the United States of America. It was decided that as a means of imposing a UN tax on all the world's citizens there should be a t ax on oil at the wellhead (ie on cars, buses and planes), and a tax on internatio nal financial transactions - which would suit both \"Rockefellers\" and \"Rothschil ds.\" As regards Iraq, the Europeans were indignant that Iraq had been inv aded without the UN's blessing, and Rumsfeld sent a message promisin g that US troops would behave more defensively and less provocativel y now. Rumsfeld was represented by Douglas Feith (his undersecretary fo r policy) and William Luti (deputy undersecretary for Near Eastern and South A sian affairs). Richard Perle, one of the advocates of war in Iraq, and Rob ert Kagan, both of PNAC, were present.

The Succession In September 2002 Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, head of the British arm of the Rothschild banking dynasty who then chaired N. M. R othschild & Sons, its merchant bank, was revealed in the British press as donating £250,000 to Policy Network Foundation, a charity set up by a gr oup of young Blairites in 2000, a \"super think-tank\" that has some of 10 D owning Street's senior policy advisors (Andrew Adonis, Roger Liddle , Lord Levy, and Adair Turner) on its board and is chaired by Peter Mandel son. Mandelson was a guest at de Rothschild's remarriage and was flown to Albania, where de Rothschild and Lord Sainsbury were taking steps to preserve the city of Butrint, a world heritage site. In June 2002 de Rot hschild attended Policy Network's \"progressive\" leaders' conference at Broc ket Hall, Hertfordshire along with Clinton and Blair, and in the evening th e gathering moved to de Rothschild's Ascott House, Buckinghamshire for a seated banquet for 100. It is clear that \"Rothschilds\" are in a good p osition to influence the British government behind the scenes. Blair has furthered the \"Rothschildite\"-Bilderberg vision of the world by working for world unity through appeasement. Bla ir's role as an appeaser has required him to surrender Northern Ire land to the IRA; the Straits of Gibraltar to Spain; an independent Briti sh foreign policy (over Afghanistan and Iraq) to America; and Britain to Eu rope. He has obscured his appeaser's role by wrapping himself in the Unio n Jack, by assuming an image of toughness towards Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Blair has been a good \"Rothschilds' man.\" It looks as if \"Roc kefellerites\" have a plan to unite the whole Western hemisphere, and as if \"R othschilds\" are going along with it while seeking to protect their Britis h financial and business interests. However we regard the Rothschilds in the past, it is clear that their empire is now crumbling.

He was kneeling under a flimsy towel-rail with a dressing-gown girdle round his neck in his Paris ho tel suite in July 1996 after a meeting to discuss merging \"Rothschilds'\" i nternational asset management operations. After initial reports that h e had committed suicide there was soon speculation that he had in f act been murdered. He was reported to have been laundering the £500b ille gally sent to Europe each year by Russia's central bank since 1991, and he had taken over from Robert Maxwell the task of bribing Soviet officials to send Soviet archives on Zionist agents to Israel. (Maxwell was a promine nt \"Rothschildite\" who acted as go-between for Israel, who honored him by burying him in Jerusalem's most prestigious cemetery after his mysterious drowning.) The supply of discounted money from the Bank of Eng land to the British banks has always been the Rothschilds' preserve. No w, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, the right to issue dis counted money has been awarded outside the Rothschild family to a new name . This is a measure of the difficulties caused by the problem of the \"Roth schildian\" succession. In February 2003 it was announced that Sir Evelyn d e Rothschild would be replaced as head of N. M. Rothschild by his dist ant French cousin, Baron David de Rothschild, in a deal thought to bring Sir Evelyn (who would continue as non-executive chairman) some £300m. A c onsequence of the death of Amschel has thus been that the London-base d Rothschild bank has passed to the French branch of the Rothschild f amily. In July it was announced that David, then 60, would take control o f the whole family-held business. A new company, Concordia BV, domiciled in the Netherlands, would hold the controlling interest in Rothschild C ontinuation Holdings, the Swiss company thought to be worth around £560m and which is the parent of most companies bearing the Rothschild nam e (including N. M. Rothschild). It was announced that David de Rothsch ild would run the business from Paris but spend more time in London; his appointment would bind the English and French families more clo sely.

To quantify the respective wealth of \"Rockefellers\" and \"Rothschilds\" today is probably impossible. There are networks of tangled front companies worth trillions. It may be fair to say th at \"Rothschilds\" (inheritors of the largest estate the world has eve r known, which may still require 300 top people to manage it in the politica l arena) 7 have more money, \"Rockefellers\" more power and influence. The two share power in the Bilderberg Group and other such bodies, as we h ave seen, and despite their rivalry and different emphases are still a fo rmidable combination.

The balance of power between \"Rothschilds\" and \"Roc kefellers\" is such that one faction is always pulling against the othe r in a never-ending tug- of-war in which we, the citizens of the world, are the rope on which they are pulling. The vastness of US indebtedness to the Central Bank is mind-boggling. The figures need to be taken in. In 1918 this debt was $1 billion; in 1974 it was $1 trillion; and by 1984 it was over $4 tril lion. The amount owed by the US government to the Federal Reserve System/ the Syndicate is now correspondingly larger. The so-called \"debt-cei ling\" (the limit to the amount of debt the Treasury can carry under federal law) of $6.43 trillion was reached, and in June 2003 Congress raised it by a further $984b to $7.414 trillion. There is a view that the true figu re was $14 trillion. This is now $15 trillion. If the lower figure is taken as t rue, America is broke, with a debt of around $7,500b. 12 Net liabilities to the rest of the world are more t han $2.3 trillion, 13 nearly 30% of GDP.

America imports more than it exports, and the gap b etween foreign earnings and foreign spending is 5% of GDP, a trend that has lasted for 25 years. And this is at a time when the US federal go vernment budget has never been higher: President Bush's budget proposal for the fiscal year 2003 was a staggering $2.128 trillion, over a third of the huge national debt. (In 2003 New York was facing a deficit of $6. 4b, and California $21b.) At the same time, President Bush has authorized a h uge increase in the Pentagon's budget which would see US defense sp ending increase from $382.2b (2003) to $399b (2004) and more than $ 500b by 2010. 14 According to Stephen Kosiak, US director of budget studies at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessment, \"We've come to the point where we're spending more money than we spent during the Cold War. Whether this is sustainable over the next six years is ques tionable.\" We saw in the opening pages of this book that whoev er controls the Federal Reserve Bank of New York controls the whole Federal Reserve System, which makes loans to commercial banks, cont rols their reserve accounts, and controls the supply of paper currency in the USA. A large part of America's $7,500b indebtedness is to \"Rocke fellers,\" who have nearly a quarter of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York stock and more than half of all Federal Reserve stock. \"Rockefelle rs\" (and to a lesser extent \"Rothschilds\") can bankrupt the US at any time if i t suits the Syndicate to turn the USA into regions of the United States of t he World.

In July 2003, Lynn Forester de Rothschil d (the new wife of Sir Evelyn, who was present) threw a party at the Orang ery, Kensington Palace for Hillary and Bill Clinton, to promote Hillary's book Living History. Peter Mandelson was of course present, along with L abour Minister and ex-Communist John Reid, Tory MP Nicholas Soames (Churchill's grandson), spin-doctor Alastair Campbell, and Sir R onald Dearlove, the retiring Director of MI6. Mrs. Clinton (who in her speech referred to \"President Blair\") is generally acknowledged to be the \"Rothschilds'\" candidate for President in 2008. Meanwhile, there w as press speculation that Condoleezza Rice, Bush Jr.'s national security advisor, would like to run for the White House in 2012. If she were to win , she could perhaps replace Hillary Clinton and be the incumbent in 201 6, the date set for the USA to be subsumed under a world government. 15 In late July 2003 it was revealed that Lynn Foreste r, now Lady de Rothschild, the wife of Sir Evelyn, had volunteered to be fundraiser for the British Labour Party's General Election cam paign, which was expected to be in 2005. She had been one of the US Democrats' most successful fundraisers and had paid for, and organi zed, all President Clinton's Third Way conferences. (She had made over $100m by selling two communications companies she had started.) She and Sir Evelyn spent their wedding night in Clinton's White House in 2000. It was also revealed that Blair would fight the next election c ommitted to serve as Prime Minister for a full third term, according to his friend, the new Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer. It was not clear where t his intention left the plan for Blair to become President of Europe; perha ps that had now been abandoned.

Khodorkovsky was seized at a Siberian a irport and was sent to prison by Russian prosecutors on charges of obtaini ng $1b by fraud and tax evasion. Prosecutors tried to freeze a 44% $15b sta ke in Yukos to protect Khodorkovsky from selling the shares on. Khodorkovs ky was said to be the beneficial owner of 59.5% of the shares of Yukos (a lthough some reports put the figure at a third, attributing some of the shares to his business partner Platon Lebedev). They found that as Khodork ovsky was unable to \"act as a beneficiary of the shares,\" voting rights had been transferred to an unnamed foreigner who turned out to be Lord Jaco b Rothschild. The son of Victor, Lord Rothschild, he had left N. M. R othschilds in 1981 when control of the bank passed to his cousin Sir Evelyn Rothschild, causing a family rift, and was thought to be worth £400m. Rot hschild was one of a number of people who had been asked to take on the voting rights. Khodorkovsky and Rothschild had put a trustee agree ment in place when Khodorkovsky realized he was facing arrest and a possible 10 years in jail. The shares were held in the Menatep Group, based in Gibraltar. It seems that Khodorkovsky had political ambitions, which were backed by Rothschild, to succeed the \"Rockefellerite\" Puti n as Russian president. Through Khodorkovsky's patronage of Opposition poli ticians he had come to control 200 MPs. It seems that the arrest was to put an end to these political ambitions - and to \"Rothschilds'\" control ling a country whose utilities had been bought by \"Rockefellers.\" It see ms that Putin had struck to prevent a situation described in a Sunday Times headline: \"Rothschild, New Power in Russia.\" It was reported that Putin had turned against capit alism generally, and that the prosecutors would turn their fire on Yukos 's rival (with which it was merging), Sibneft, and its major shareholder Ro man Abramovich, who had bought Chelsea Football Club in London.

The siting of the United States of Europe in Brussels, Strasbourg, an d Frankfurt is in cities that have long had strong links with \"Rothschilds\" and the Syndicate. The European dream is of a united Europe that is de signed to prevent war, in which nationalism will be tamed and with an economy as large as America's. It is a political vision with an economi c angle that masks the dream. The three central pillars of political Europ ean integration are the single market, the single currency, and regional go vernments being able to bypass national governments. (Regional governments are federated to the European Union inasmuch as they receive regional fu nds from Brussels and exercise the powers granted by Brussels.) The g reat paradox of Europe - one that the Syndicate is well placed to exploit - is that unelected EU officials in the European Central Bank give instruc tions on how to bring down budget deficits to politicians of former natio n-states' regions who have been elected. The future direction of Europe d epends on whether the EU bureaucracy, notably the European Central Ba nk's, will be made more democratically accountable.

World Institutions 9 The Syndicate have already taken steps to create a world army. The European Army is to contribute to this world army; European troops will be based in every European state including the regions of En gland. The UN has already begun to set up a world police force, which will have the power to move into any country, including the United States, at short notice. In 1998 the \"Rothschildian\" world government arrang ed for the setting- up of the International Criminal Court (ICC), which was endorsed by 120 nations in Rome, but not the US. The ICC was offici ally set up by the UN, but is outside the control of the \"Rockefellerite\" UN Security Council. If the Security Council were to control which cases co me before the court, Washington could use its UN veto to block the prose cution of Americans. The \"Rockefellerites\" are alarmed that the court co uld bring politically inspired prosecutions, for example against Henry Ki ssinger on charges arising from his role in the Vietnam War and agains t Donald Rumsfeld on charges connected to the War on Terror. Both men could be arrested while traveling abroad like the former Chilean dict ator Augusto Pinochet. Alternatively, there could be attempted legal actio n like that in Belgium against Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. Some American conservatives have seen the creation of the ICC as \"another step towards world government\" that threat ens US sovereignty. If it were true that President Bush Jr. had sided w ith the defenders of US sovereignty against the world government, this woul d be dramatic and encouraging news. In fact, as we have seen, Bush Jr . and Kissinger are deeply identified with the \"Rockefellerite\" world g overnment, and they are using the language of US sovereignty to extrica te themselves from a European-\"Rothschildite\" initiative which could lay some past activities open to prosecution and act as a brake on future gl obal operations. Congress has passed legislation authorizing militar y action to free any (\"Rockefellerite\") American taken into custody to b e brought before the ICC.

The head of Grand Orient F reemasonry at the time of the inauguration of the United States of Eu rope at Maastricht on December 31, 1992 was France's President Francoi s Mitterand, who was the most powerful 33rd-degree Freemason in Euro pe. 12 He helped inaugurate Freemasonry's long awaited United States of Europe. In 1983 he had hired the Japanese architect I. M. Pei to cr eate a glass pyramid with 673 windows (presumably representing, besides world government, the intended 666 districts of the completed United Stat es of Europe, plus 7 Masonic/Syndicate leaders) in the courtyard of the Louvre (the old royal castle), 13 a triangular Illuminati monument whose design is l inked with that of the meditation room in the UN. It was Mitterand of the Grand Orient who, according to media reports (angrily denied by Kohl), channeled £10m to Chancel lor Kohl's 1994 re- election campaign, via Elf-Aquitaine, the State-own ed French oil company which (thanks to Kohl's acting as facilitator) boug ht the East German oil refinery of Leuna and obtained the right to buy pet rol stations in Eastern Germany. The supplier of the £10m used a multinatio nal oil company to promote France's interests in East Germany, and Mitterand and Kohl were his proxies. A Corsican businessman has allege d that, with the knowledge of Mitterand and Kohl, he allowed the for mer head of Elf to use his letterbox for companies in Liechtenstein to cha nnel DM85m (£27m) to German political parties including Kohl's when E lf bought the Leuna oil refinery.

The Syndicate secures its aim s in the United States of Europe created in December 1992 by a clientilist sy stem of patronage. The Grand Orient were behind the French and Russian Rev olutions, and now they are behind the New World Order Revolution in E urope; a process that has happened before is happening all over again. But it has not happened yet. It is an idea whose ti me is coming. Lenin spoke of a United States of the World, and, if publ ic opinion can be manipulated into agreeing, it may happen in our lif etimes. How a United States of the World May Be Consolidate d If the New World Order were being conducted by sain ts as a Utopian replica of Heaven on earth, then it would lead to the aboli tion of war, disease, famine, and unrest, the Four Horsemen of the Apocal ypse, and would be wholly good. It would be an outcome the whole of ma nkind would long for, and it would be consolidated by the enthusiast ic assent of all who place the interests of mankind above those of the nation- state. But what would a Syndicate New World Order be like? The danger is it would be a socialist state in which there would be a redistribution of wealth and a reduced standard of living for all Wes terners. (There would be howls of rage as their hard-earned pensions and savings are shared with the poorest among mankind who have paid no con tributions.) There would be regimentation and restriction on movement, with no freedom of worship, no freedom to buy or own private property, no free speech, and no freedom to publish. From a personal point of vie w, most Westerners would not want to give up such freedoms, and make s uch sacrifices. From the point of view of the whole, however, they might well come to regard a system that brings equality to all the world's ci tizens as worthy of such sacrifices. (One of the objects of the Fabian Socie ty has been to make equality and justice synonymous, whereas equality a nd justice are not identical.) Such trust would be misplaced."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"266 The Syndicate Mind Control Could it involve mind control? Such an idea may see m preposterous.

With all this already in place, the infrastructure of a worl d government is already present in embryonic form. Depopulation The vision of the inspirers of world government sur faced on July 24, 1980, when the results of a two-volume study begun by the CFR, the Trilateral Commission, and the IMF when Jimmy Carter took offi ce, and involving hundreds of consultants, were unveiled at a press c onference by Secretary of State Edmund Muskie: The Global 2000 Report to t he President. 14 This projected the global economic trends of the next 20 years, from 1980 to 2000. Hundreds of outside consultants contributed, as did scores of task- force personnel from the State Department and White House Council on Environmental Quality. The study predicted a wor ld endangered by overpopulation, food shortages, and environmental h azards, and by implication forecast 170 million deaths through dis ease and famine in the developing countries by 2000. The Report built on \"Rockefellerite\" policies. Popu lation control was given prominence by John D. Rockefeller III's estab lishment of a Population Council in 1952 to issue manifestos in favor of \"ze ro population growth\"; by the Club of Rome's 1971 report (published in 197 2), Limits to Growth; and by Laurance Rockefeller's 1972 report on popula tion growth. The Report predicted (on pp. 1 and 3) that the worl d population would rise from 4.1 billion in 1975 to 6.35 billion in 20 00, 10 billion by 2030 and 30 billion by the end of the twenty-first century ( by 2091, p. 428 of the Report). After 2000, \"100m people (will be) added e ach year compared with 75m in 1975\" (p. 1). The Report lowered the fi gure of 6.35 billion to 6.18 billion (p. 12) as 170 million were expecte d to die: \"In the years ahead, lack of food for the urban poor, lack of job s and increasing illness and misery may slow the growth of LDC (less develop ed countries) cities and alter the trend.

Worl d population in 2000 would be estimated at about 6.18 (as opposed to 6.3 5) b.\" The scaled-down figure of 6.18 billion was too pess imistic. In fact, the world's population reached 6 billion on August 5,19 99, just a few months before 2000, which suggests that the true number of deaths due to disease and famine may have been 350 million, not 170 milli on. (There was no fall in the world's birth rate: by 2003 the world's popu lation had crept up to 6.3 billion.) The Report raised the question of how great a popul ation the earth can \"carry\" (p. 41): The Global 2000 Study does not est imate the earth's carrying capacity, but it does provide a basis for evaluatin g an earlier estimate published in the US National Academy of Sciences' r eport, Resources and Man. In this 1969 report the Academy concluded that a world population of 10b \"is close to (if not above) the maximum that an intensively managed world might hope to support with some degree of com fort and individual choice ....\" Nothing in the Global 2000 Study count ers the Academy's conclusions. If anything, data gathered over the pa st decade suggest the Academy may have underestimated the extent of some problems, especially deforestation and the loss and deterioration of soi ls. The Report wound up (pp. 41-2): \"At present and pro jected growth rates, the world's population would rapidly approach the A cademy's figures. If the fertility and mortality rates projected for 2000 were to continue unchanged into the twenty-first century, the world' s population would reach 10b by 2030 ... This same rate of growth woul d produce a population of nearly 30b before the end of the end of the twen ty-first century ... As the world's populations exceed and reduce the land' s carrying capacity in widening areas, the trends of the last century or t wo toward improved health and longer life may come to a halt. Hunger a nd disease may claim more lives - especially lives of babies and y oung children. More of those surviving infancy may be mentally and physica lly handicapped by childhood malnutrition.\" Six months later, in January 1981, the Council on E nvironmental Quality published policy recommendations on this document: Global Future: A Time to Act.

Its cornerstone was \"population control\" through an aggressive program of family pl anning, sterilization, contraception, and abortion, which might reduce the world population by 4.2 billion (more exactly, 4.16 billion) (p. 50) : \"This effort could also mean that global population would eventually stabil ize at 8b, versus the 12.2b that would result if higher fertility rates c ontinued over a longer period of time. The difference of 4.2b is almost eq ual to the total current world population.\" (\"Current\" meant \"in 1981.\") If such a program was not implemented, millions of people would die by fa mine and violence. If rising standards of living and health care, high economic growth rates, developing nuclear energy resources, advanced infra structure, and other industry in developing countries were to allow the 170 million victims of famine and war to survive, then mankind would ex ceed the \"carrying capacity\" of the globe. The globe could not \"carry\" mankind, according to the Reports. \"The key concept is sustainable develo pment\" (p. 12). The Global Future report sets no targets, contains no tables. It speaks in very general terms. Is it to be taken at face value ? Or is it between-the-lines stuff? \"Unless population growth can be brought und er control\" (p. 19), wretched consequences will follow for mankind. \"The opportunity to stabilize the world's populatio n below 10 billion, for example, is slipping away.\" We have just seen t hat a declared aim of the Report was \"that global population would eventu ally stabilize at 8b\" (p. 50).

On the contrary, scientific development is to be restricted, as is f ood production. Nuclear energy development is to be prevented.

The Global Future Report focuses on family planning rather than on wars, famine, and disease to reduce population. The reality is that wars destroy crops and promote famine and diseases, and encourage refugees whose resistance is weakened and who can succumb to their wretched circumstances.

Both Reports were accepted by President Carter. Hun dreds of conferences and discussions took place about these two Reports, and Cyrus Vance of the Trilateral Commission chairing t he Committee of the Year 2000, announced his vision of \"a new world order based on environmentalism.\" The main thrust of the Committee 's outlook was that if the world population carried on growing at its t hen rate of growth, the world's resources would not be able to sustain it.

At the same time one fi fth of the world's population is on the starvation line, or under it. Forced depopulation has undoubtedly happened.

Are they pursuing the same traditions and asp irations that drove their forebears during the first half of the twenti eth century? There must be a strong presumption that they are. Do these con siderations include controlling the world population? Are the Global 20 00 reports policy rather than forecasts?

They were policy, members of the jury."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"The United States of the World 275 The drive towards world government (the Global Plan tation) has been achieved at the cost of numerous local wars, the co llapse of the European Empires, and the dismantling of many nation-states to pave the way for a United States of Europe. There have been millions o f deaths in wars of de- colonization and independence as liberation movemen ts have conducted guerilla warfare to bring in what they thought woul d be a new nation but which is turning out to be the creation of a new re gional bloc in the world government. Are not Western leaders opposed to Europe's nation- states? Are they not bringing in a new European constitution while c oncealing their real intentions? Are they not creating a world gove rnment for a few, the Syndicate, to prosper commercially while the many a re disenfranchised? Are not the poor of the world to be made victims of war merely so that the oligarchic Syndicate can flourish? George Orwell saw the greatest threat to our well-b eing as totalitarianism. The greatest threat is not totalitarianism but cove rt oligarchy masquerading as democracy and manipulating it and hiding behind it in a totalitarian way.

No small cohort of mega -billionaires has seized the reins of the world in secret.

It won't affect the reality that the resulting worldwide authority will be manipulated just as bef ore by those who seek to dominate world government. Universalism Global democracy is rooted in political Universalis m. Universalist thinking sees all mankind, in all cultures and civilizations and at all periods of recorded history, in terms of the spiritual and met aphysical One, which pervades all religions and unifies the universe. It differs from globalism, which is merely spatial/geographical, not spiritual . Just as religious Universalism holds that God and the universe are On e and that the souls of all Mankind, not just Christians, can be saved, so political Universalism holds that all mankind is One and promotes the rule of all mankind with the participation of all mankind, as all human bein gs have souls. Moves towards political Universalism have taken pla ce during the 1990s. The Commission on Global Governance 3 has sought a framework for global politics and decision-making. The Earth Summ it in Rio, Agenda 21, The Earth Charter, the Real World Coalition, Earth Action's Call for a Safer World, the One Planet Initiative, and the Citizens' Public Trust Treaty have all made global declarations on development. The Ha gue Agenda for Peace has sought to eliminate war: the campaign against l andmines has changed international law, and international conferences at New York, Vienna, Cairo, Copenhagen, Beijing, and Istanbul have focused on g ender equality, family, employment, and social rights. The Inter-Parliament ary Union, which includes over 130 national parliaments, 4 adopted the Universal Declaration of Democracy, which has been endorsed by most parli aments in the world, while Jubilee 2000 has campaigned for the cancellat ion of unpayable debts owed by the world's poorest countries.

The UN has been sidelined in the quest for global democracy, but it too could be mad e more accountable. In particular the UN's mandate \"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\" could be applied equally to all peo ples in the world. Since the UN Charter was signed, over 30 million pe ople have been killed in war, millions more have died in genocide and ethnic conflict, and over 100 million have fled their homes, of whom 20 million remain refugees today. The UN has proved inadequate but is better than nothing, and is the only arena in which all countries sit to gether. For global governance to be accountable, the decisi on-takers of each country must be answerable to the public of each co untry (i.e. each state within the United States of the World). All decisio ns should be compatible with public criteria of environmental suitability, the principles of equality and human rights, and social and economic justice. Problems that can be tackled at a global level include the environmen t, biodiversity, food security and climate change, international security and disarmament, international trade, finance and labor rights, epid emics, communications, and international crime.

A Choice of New World Orders? This view may be too pessimistic. The New World Ord er Revolution can in fact proceed in one of two directions. Ahead of us is a stark choice between two New World Orders. There are two New World Orders - one in the revolutionary ima ge of Lucifer and one in the spiritual image of Christ. 5 Which will triumph? The answer to that question will determine the health of the North Ame rican and European civilizations during the next millennium. Just as there are two New World Orders, so there ar e two Universalisms: the good kind I have developed in my philosophy, wh ich thinks globally about the whole of mankind and sees globally in ter ms of the souls of human beings, each of which has equally emerged fro m the One (the metaphysical Fire or Light); and the bad kind which owes much to Freemasonry and is dominated by the occult, particu larly Luciferianism. For some, the revolutionary Lucifer is the god of w orldly wealth and the flesh, and is a secular metaphor for \"bad and malev olent.\" The tension between these two Universalisms is shap ing the growing heresy of our time, which can be contacted through the New Age movement and proliferating Eastern sects. The good Universal ism enshrines the vision of the mystics of all cultures and civilizat ions in global purity. The bad Universalism purveys the cynical and corrupt Lu ciferian vision of the Illuminati, which has been adopted by the Syndicate . Christ's New World Order - and I use Christ as a se cular metaphor to mean \"good and benevolent,\" not in any sense of evangelical fundamentalism exported round the world - will embr ace and enfold an Islam purged of terrorism within its globalism. It holds out the prospect of a Utopia to end all Utopias: all humankind livin g at peace, free from war, famine, and disease through globally planned r esources, each world citizen in touch with his or her inner nature and m etaphysical reality.

The New World Order Revolution can open up and beco me accountable. Wars, famines, and diseases can be eliminated by gl obal planning, by a truly Universalist (i.e. spiritual pan-human but no n-Masonic) outlook that sees all mankind as the constituency of the wo rld's leaders. This is (to use a contrasting personifying symbol and free it from its Christian- fundamentalist associations) Christ's New World Ord er, a compassionate order, which liberates the poor and feeds and frees all mankind. One day such global planning may mean that every ci tizen of the world is governed by the principles outlined by St Paul i n The Acts of the Apostles (2:44-5): \"Now the company of those who believed we re of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the things wh ich he possessed was his own, but they had everything in common .... The re was not a needy person among them, for as many as were possessors o f lands or houses sold them, and brought the proceeds of what was sol d and laid it at the apostles' feet; and distribution was made to each a s any had need.\" Such a physical consolidation of the spiritual vision of t he oneness and harmony of humankind would spread contentment throughout th e earth and turn Universalism into a positive creed of human love. The spiritual vision which sees \"all is One, all ma nkind is my brother\" (as can be known in the poetic vision) also grasps that when \"the Kingdom of God\" is literalized it degenerates or steps down and becomes physical in globalization.

A world government run by saints will be better than one run by self-interested bandits. It is not easy to establish a world government of s aints. Cromwell found it impossible to create a national Parliament of saints, let alone a world Parliament of enlightened men. In the cours e of my research I have established that all revolutions have begun as occult visions and have degenerated into less-than-ideal political and physical regimes as the original occult vision steps down to political gove rnment.

Will the New W orld Order leaders apply the thinking of Satan as interpreted by the G rand Inquisitor, or will they jettison Lucifer's New Age with its emblem of the All-Seeing Eye over an unfinished pyramid (the occult hieroglyph of the New World Order Revolution so far)?

If such a model is being proposed, it is a dictatorial, Freem asonic model. This possible direction for the New World Order is accompanied by a disquieting belief system.

It seems that in the case of the Luciferian model each stage of the \"stepping down\" process also involves progressively bringing out wh at is most base in human nature. There is therefore another sense in w hich the vision \"steps down\" into the physical world. On the other hand wi th the dynamic of the Universalist New World Order, it seems that each st age of the \"stepping down\" process also progressively involves bringing out what is the highest in human nature. In effect, it is a \"stepping up\" p rocess for humankind. The revelation that the New World Order's progress towards a political one-world government is an occult corruption of a U niversalist spiritual vision should not come as a great surprise. However , although there have been many clues the reader may not be prepared for the revelation (an alarming \"twist in the tale\") that the God the Free masons serve is none other than Lucifer. 7 The composite god of the Masonic quasi-religion, k nown as Je-Ho-Vah Jah-Bul-On, is believed by Christians to refer to an incarnation of Satan. The syllables combine four names of God: the Hebrew Jehovah, the Chaldean Jah, the Syriac-Canaanite Baal, and th e Egyptian On or Osiris-Re, a reference to the Temple of Re at Helio polis. The four names mean that Jehovah, God, is Chaldean-Canaanite-Egypt ian, i.e. horned like Baal, i.e. Lucifer. 8 This is only revealed to 30th, 31st, 32nd, and 33r d-degree Freemasons and may come as a shock to many lower-ra nking Freemasons who joined to do good works and support charitable causes. 9 In fact, a number of US presidents have been 33rd-d egree Freemasons, including such organizers of the contemporary New W orld Order as George W. Bush (who though a born-again Christian a sked to be sworn in as president on the same Masonic Bible his fathe r had used), his father Bush Sr., Bill Clinton, and Gerald Ford. Other infl uential New World Order organizers are reputed to include John D. Roc kefeller IV, David Rockefeller, Bob Dole, Newt Gingrinch, Al Gore, Jes se Jackson, and Ross Perot. 10 The reader may be equally surprised at the revelati on (and again there have been many clues) that if the New World Order is con trolled by influential Freemasons, then consequently its outlook is active ly Luciferian, indeed Satanist.

Lucifer/Semiramis According to legend, Lucifer, the Angel Satanail or Satanael, was the elder son of God (Christ being God's second son). 12 Although he had great power, he sought to be greater than God, his Father, and a ttempted to overthrow him and become ruler of Heaven and Earth. The archa ngel Michael flung him into the abyss, and as he fell an emerald becam e detached from his diadem and landed in the Hindu Kush Mountains (near bin Laden's mountain hideout). Those who follow Lucifer hold a dualistic rather than a unitary vision of the universe as they champion S atanail against his brother Christ and work for a \"one-world government \" in which Lucifer is in control of the world at God's expense. They h ave divided the unity of creation. 13 At a practical, physical level members of the Syndi cate admire the Luciferian tradition. Worshipping money and world r evolution, seeking an alternative to the Christian nation-states of me dieval Europe, the main members of the Syndicate have turned to Freemasonry and have followed the example of Weishaupt and Pike in placing themse lves beneath the figure of Satan/Lucifer. The implications of this belief system for the Synd icate's New World Order are profound. The Syndicate regards the comin g United States of Europe as the seat of the Antichrist. It is rumored that it will eventually have in regions, each with 6 zones, totaling 666 di stricts or counties - the number of the mark of the Beast. 14 In preparation for this finished creation, the central (NATO) computer in Brussels, on which e very European citizen's records are placed, is called \"The 666\" o r \"The Beast.\" (It is three storeys high and has the capacity to house numbers - all prefixed \"666\" - for all persons in the world.) 15 Such Satanic imagery is not accidental. Similarly, the 12 golden stars on the blue flag of Europe and the New World Order are Satanic. 16 The flag was unveiled in Paris on July 14, 1989, the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution whic h was orchestrated by Freemasonic secret societies. The flag appeared to be patterned after the Miraculous Medal of the Virgin Mary made in 1832, a billion of which had"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"288 The Syndicate been sold by 1876, and to represent the crown of Ma ry, Queen of Heaven. The symbol is drawn from the Woman (see below) clot hed with the sun, standing on the moon with a crown of 12 stars on he r head (Revelation 12:1), 17 whom Catholics teach is Mary. The message appears to be that the Queen of Heaven is a symbol around which predominan tly Catholic Europe can unify. The poster of the uncompleted Tower of B abel under 12 stars (see below) was released at the same time as the flag.

Later she was wors hipped as Vesta and"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"Epilogue: World Government versus Global Democracy 289 Venus. 21 The mysterious Queen of Heaven is thus a harlot pr etending to be a virgin. 22 The 12 stars have nothing to do with the number of countries in the EU, but represent the crown of this Semirami s associated with impurity: Satan's bride and Queen. 23 This Semiramis is shown on old coins with spoked rays on her head 24 and appears as the Statue of Liberty, a gift from Freemasons in Paris to Freemasons in Ne w York. 25 She holds the torch of liberty representing the knowledge of the illuminated - the Illuminati - but also stands as the bride of Lucife r. 26 The statue copies a Masonic statue on an island in the Seine. 27 This is Satan's, or Lucifer's, New World Order. If the Global 2000 reports are pol icy, its Malthusian goals include extermination for a third of mankind by planned wars, famines, and diseases. For Freemasons Babylon has a special significance 28 because under the rule of Nimrod mankind was united, a unity symboliz ed in the Tower of Babel. It had been known for some time that occulti sts behind the New World Order have sought to control the Babylonian r uins that gave rise to the Whore of Babylon and the Tower of Babel, 29 and the Sumerian ruins of the ziggurat of Ur, the birthplace of Abraham, w hich was built by 4000 BC and restored by Nebuchadnezzar II in the sixth c entury BC. Babylonian religion developed round traditions conc erning the \"ungodly\" rule of Nimrod, which was in Babel, Erech, Akkad, a nd Calneh (Genesis 10:10), and his wife Semiramis and her child Tammuz . Semiramis was also known as Semele, who was identified with the m oon (and so, later, Diana); after his death, Nimrod's body was cut into pieces and burnt, and his ashes were sent to different parts of his kingd om and he became known as the sun-god. 30 Around 2400 BC northern Akkad dominated Sumer, and the rites of Tammuz held on the top of ziggurats su ch as Ur invoked the moon-goddess, who had a shrine on the ziggurat's to p, but also invoked the sun-god. The rites focused on the death of Tamm uz, the vegetation god; his imprisoning in the Underworld; and his ris ing in the spring after the Queen of Heaven descended to reclaim him. There was then a Royal Sacred Marriage between the risen Tammuz and the Qu een of Heaven (who was later known as Inanna). 31 Oil aside, were members of the Syndicate (Freemason ic Illuminati) partly drawn to Iraq, using American and British tr oops, because of the occultist significance of Babylon and Ur?

A new century and a n ew millennium bring hope. Our study has shown that for more than a hundred ye ars Western statesmen have pursued the elusive dream of world p eace - through wars and violent revolutions. The dream is revolutionary and Utopian. In the twentieth century, because they were inspire d by the Syndicate, all revolutions can be seen to belong to a single world revolutionary movement committed to the creation of one-world government. Particularly in the twentieth century revolutions have been manipulated by the Syndicate for its own purposes. We have seen that the New World O rder seeks to free humankind from established religion and (on the wis hes of one faction) replace it with a Freemasonic religion of Lucifer. Nevertheless, it is still possible that Christ's New World Order of global de mocracy will emerge like a butterfly from its present chrysalis. Will this noblest of hopes for a better world be fu lfilled?

In fact, I see civilizations as progressing through phases, during some of which (in expansionist phases) they create regio nal blocs. The North American civilization is passing through an expansi onist phase and is \"conquering\" the world and imposing on it the philo sophy of its own founding fathers: democracy, freedom, federalism, a nd capitalism. The Byzantine-Russian civilization, by contrast, is old er and more advanced and has entered a phase in which a union (the Commu nist USSR) has broken up into smaller components that are linked f ederally. It is not that I prefer nation-states and empires t o regional blocs and fragments, but that I see nation-states, empires, b locs, and fragments as consequences or symptoms of specific phases in t he rise and fall of specific civilizations. A civilization's globalist phase/new world order that is good for mankind - like the best traditions of the British Empire, with its educative mission - and abolishes war, fam ine, and disease is preferable to one that promotes war, famine, diseas e, depopulation, and its own brand of terrorism to widen its power. The management of civilizations in relation to each other depends on the degree of benevolence of the dominant civilizat ion and the degree of benevolence of civilizations that oppose it. Sta tes have to organize themselves through global institutions. The global institutions are only as good as the dominant civilization - at present t he North American civilization. The UN, like the League of Nations, h as its faults: it can be manipulated by the dominant civilization and more p owerful nations. Despite the Syndicate's plan for it, the UN will ne ver impose a world rule on nations as it is not strong enough - for it is m erely a reflection of the forces of its member states. The only way states ca n cooperate is through global institutions, short of world government.

If America is benevolent, then the UN's world army would be a force for good. If America is malevolent, the UN should remai n a talking-shop and not conquer other nations. As regimes go, the US ad ministration appears from the outside to be reasonably decent. From what we have seen in this book, the Syndicate is a pressure on the US adminis tration within the North American civilization that is not a benevolen t force for universal good. The Syndicate wants world dominance and has reacted against the Arab civilization, which has challenged it. This ch allenge has clothed itself in terrorist methods. How the UN responds to terrorism depends on the nature of the challenge. Bin Laden wants the Arab civilization to become strong and pay the West back for past humili ations: pay Spain back for ending the Moorish Andalus; Britain and Am erica for allowing Israel to be planted in its midst; and Europe for s ending crusaders to the Middle East and driving the Arabs back from the gat es of Vienna. He has awakened the spirit of Saladin during the Crusades. Hence he refers to Western armies as \"the Crusaders.\" The truth is, th ere is a bitter struggle between Wahhabist extremists within the Arab civili zation against the North American civilization - the Middle-Eastern re bellion in which death is glorious and suicide-bombers are martyrs. The Syndicate's plan is to defeat and conquer the A rab civilization and take its oil. It involves a clash between the N orth American and Arab civilizations as I predicted in The Fire and t he Stones: a war between civilizations. The Syndicate wants to blur this by speaking of an alliance against terrorism. It will be said that there is an Anglo-American-Libyan alliance against al-Qaeda (like a Roman alliance wi th an African client-state against Jugurtha). This is false. Libya is not comm itted to exterminating al-Qaeda but to getting on the right side of the US and Britain so that the Libyan economy can be re-floated, which will help G addafi to survive. It is an alliance of convenience. We are living through a clash between two civilizat ions, a war picked by the US to further its expansionist phase and world dominance and called a war against terrorism. The regional blocs and break -ups that have already happened or are coming into being have to be seen w ithin this aggressive intention. They are not being created with altruist ic benevolent intentions "},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"Epilogue: World Government versus Global Democracy 293 but out of self-interest. Because the US is in a po werful, expansionist phase if its development, the globalist groupings p romote US self-interest, though they are hailed by Americans as being for th e good of mankind. Today, the language of national self-interest is co uched in altruism. An expanding civilization is, by its very nature, g overned by self-interest rather than benevolent altruism. (The same was true of the British Empire, which nevertheless managed to include an as tonishing degree of altruism.) Therefore each time such a civilization intervenes aggressively, it is something of a disaster for the rest of manki nd - although there can be universal benefits when tyrants are brought low. Wh at should be happening is the spreading of a benevolent New World Order th at combines freedom and justice for all mankind with freedom from famin e, disease, and war. This is the (probably unattainable) goal and ideal, and it is worth giving up nation-states for such a Utopian paradise. When a m alevolent New World Order, motivated by acquisitiveness and greed, thre atens to sweep aside our traditional freedoms, national groupings, and c ulture for reasons of self-interest, the nation-state is preferable to th e regional bloc. It is not globalism itself that is wrong but unbene volent globalism dedicated to the self-interested widening of power and influence and acquisition of natural resources and oil. And yet, we cannot really say that such self-interested globalism is \"wrong\" for it is a product of the rise and fall of civilizations, a manifestation of a phase. It happens, and is arguably no more \"wrong\" than the swoop of a large bird of p rey. Nevertheless, enlightened globalism is preferable. A democratic g lobalism within a benevolent civilization in an expansionist phase would be a boon for mankind, as was (for some of the time and in parts, but not in places such as Amritsar, the scene of a dreadful massacre in India) life under the generally remarkably enlightened British Empire. Some individuals among the Syndicate's leaders may have such enlightened good intentions and aspire to an ideali stic and benevolent view of mankind, and hope to benefit mankind throug h the UN. We have seen enough in this book to conclude that the major ity of the Syndicate pursue an agenda of accumulating oil reserves and n atural resources, fomenting civil wars, and manipulating the UN into rooking mankind. They either do not aspire to good intentions or dis guise their real self- interested motives with altruistic-sounding lies."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"294 The Syndicate Taming the Phoenix My study of revolutions has established that they a re not merely destructive mechanisms.

It must be said, however, that they contr ibute greatly to the \"stepping down\" of a civilization from its original spiritual vision to its eventual disintegration. I am aware that this is something of a pioneering w ork. When the history of the growth of the world government comes to be written in the twenty-first century, reference will have to be mad e to the growth of the \"Rockefeller Empire\" in the twentieth century and i ts use of revolutions, which in turn requires the study of previous revolu tions. The foregoing pages, and those in their companion volume The Secr et History of the West, are fundamental to an understanding of the expandin g world government in our time, which, even though it is ignored by th e news media, is the biggest story of our lifetimes. Its growth is inext ricably linked with the continuing ascendancy of the North American civiliz ation. The world's revolutionary spirit is like the mythic al phoenix. There is only one of it, and it is reborn every 500 years. N esting in Arabia (not far from \"Rockefellers,\"' and bin Laden's, Saudi Ar abia) it emerged from its anti-Catholic predecessor's body and was nurtur ed on Rosicrucianism and first flew in 1776. Its birth sent shock waves round the world, causing seismic activity that has disturbed the oceans. The earthquakes have continued during its growth to maturity. Now the gigantic phoenix, beautiful though it is, h as become a menace. Each time it has stirred it has made waves. Since 1450 each of the world's revolutions has been accompanied by small waves. By the end of the twentieth century th e small waves have multiplied in each regional bloc (Europe, Latin Ame rica, Africa, the Middle East, and South East Asia), and the sea leve l has risen.

Fundamental changes to our nation-state are taking place in our time. A seismic shift is happening before our eyes: the n ational characteristics which Churchill and Montgomery fought so hard to de fend are being submerged in a tide of multiculturalism, Europe-dri ven changes that have affected our currency, and globalist thinking which has created a Global Coalition. The nation-state leader feels powerless to confront the approaching tidal wave. Frustrated by the expectations of his c ourt, King Canute sat on the shore to demonstrate to his courtiers his power lessness to control the sea (or the weather, or harvests). He was a wise ma n and was graphically demonstrating to his courtiers the limitations of h is sovereign power in relation to the universal tidal force of the sea by getting his feet wet and having to move his throne further up the beach. Confronting the tidal wave on the beaches (to use C hurchill's phrase) will mean suffering Canute's fate. The only wise co urse is to shackle its cause - the monstrous phoenix. A Beowulf is needed to seek out Grendel and tame the monster. \"Wyrd oft nereth unfaegne eor l thonne his ellen deah\": \"fate often preserves the undoomed warrior when his courage is strong.\" Or so the Beowulf poet, writing in England in the e arly Anglo-Saxon period, informs us.

An alternative s olution lies within us all - in that part of us which is \"the best (or highest )\" we can aspire to. The pressing task is to produce a world philosophy - Universalism - that accords all world citizens dignity and genuinely de mocratic rights, but has no truck with the secret agendas of Freemasonry or Luciferianism. Such a philosophy must be based on the good, mystic way of Light that seeks to do its best for all humankind rather than the evil, occult way of darkness that seeks to destroy a third of humankind.

In all the revolutions before the twentieth century, an idealist has an oc cultist vision, which others state in intellectual terms. This becomes co rrupted by a political regime, and results in physical suppression (such a s Stalin's purge). There is a \"stepping down\" process from the origina l vision, through its intellectual and political expression to its ph ysical consolidation. All revolutions have promised greater freedom for their peoples and have ended up enslaving them. The New World Order Revolu tion, though unfinished, is no exception and conforms to the pat tern. Early Dynamic of the Syndicate's New World Order Re volution The first two phases of that dynamic can be stated more fully in terms of a sequence of five sub-phases: 1. The occultist vision is heretical, in the sense tha t it is outside the orthodoxy of the Christian religion. In the New Wor ld Order's case it is Freemasonic. 2. This vision is then interpreted to others so that i t reaches an audience. In the New World Order's case the \"interpreting\" wa s performed by the Round Table. 3.

In the N ew World Order's case this role has been performed by the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). 4. The heretical vision that has been interpreted and covertly turned into action is then interpreted by a thoughtful intellec tual. He expresses it within a group or groups and promotes the revolu tionary idea in a new way. In the New World Order's case this role is performed within the Bilderberg Group and Trilateral Commission. 5. This intellectual expression of the revolutionary i dea is then taken up by a new thinker, who puts it into practice outs ide the political system. In the New World Order Revolution this semi -political action is the tearing down of the Berlin Wall. The formula of the full early revolutionary dynamic will enable us to review the evidence we have assembled in greater detail: 1. The heretical occultist vision of the New World Ord er Revolution is found in the Sionist Rosicrucian - and also Grand O rient Templar - Adam Weishaupt, who was funded by Mayer Amschel R othschild. 2. The occultist interpreter was Cecil Rhodes'/Lord Mi lner's Round Table, which was backed by the Weishauptian \"Rothsc hilds\" and the Syndicate of Western capitalists; the main interpre ter was eventually the historian Arnold Toynbee, who dominated Chatham House for 30 years and produced A Study of History, which interp reted Weishaupt's vision. 3. The occult revolutionary originator was John D. Roc kefeller I, the richest man in the world. He supported the CFR and created a worldwide oil empire through revolutions and inte rpreted Weishaupt's and Toynbee's vision in terms of his hi dden Freemasonic tradition which kept the knowledge secret. His son, John D. Rockefeller II, continued his policy and donated a sum to pay for the land for the UN building. By influencing the select ion of UN and government personnel through the CFR he controlled the UN and many governments. 4. The thoughtful intellectual interpreter who gave th e vision a new slant was his grandson, David Rockefeller of the Bi lderberg Group and Trilateral Commission, considered the most powe rful man in the"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"Appendices 299 world. Did he control the USSR? He has arguably bee n the Weishaupt of our time. 5. The semi-political intellectual interpreter who later became political was Gorbachev, who became a Grand Orient Mason in 1 984 and then brought down the Berlin Wall and ended the Cold War , paving the way for the successors to the British, German, and Russian Empires to join the US in a post-nation-state world governm ent. The early revolutionary dynamic of the Syndicate's New World Order Revolution can be stated (or summarized) as follows : Heretical occultist vision Occultist interpreter Occult revolutionary originator Thoughtful intellectual interpreter Semi- political intellectual interpreter Weishaupt/Mayer Amschel Rothschild Cecil Rhodes'/ Milner's Round Table/Arnold Toynbee (\"Rothschilds\") John D. Rockefeller I/II David Rockefeller Gorbachev Dynamic of Nazi Revolution We need to relate this pattern to the Syndicate's f ailed attempts to achieve world government in the twentieth century. The evid ence laid out suggests that representatives of the Syndicate made two atte mpts: first by financing Hitler, and then by sustaining and ending the Cold War. The five sub-phases of the first two stages of the dynamic of the Nazi Revolution were as follows: 1. The heretical occultist vision of the Nazi Revoluti on can be found in Weishaupt and his Bavarian Illuminati. 2. The occultist interpreter was the anti-Semitic von Liebenfels, whose New Templars revived the Templar republican side of Weishaupt's vision under the emblem of the swastika. 3. The occult revolutionary originator was Dietrich Ec kart, leading figure of the Thule Society and a Manichean. 4. The thoughtful intellectual interpreter who gave th e occult vision a new slant was Anton Drexler, founder of the German Workers' Party, which Hitler renamed the Nazi Party. 5. The semi-political intellectual who later became po litical was Adolf Hitler, whose Mein Kampf stated Nazism as a politic al program."},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"300 The Syndicate The early revolutionary dynamic of the Nazi Revolut ion can be summarized as follows: Heretical occultist vision Occultist interpreter Occult revolutionary originator Thoughtful intellectual interpreter Semi- political intellectual interpreter Weishaupt von Liebenfels Eckart Drexler Hitler The intellectual expression of the Nazi Revolution was through Goebbels' propaganda ministry and Himmler's SS, who were trai ned at Schloss Wewelsburg. Rosenberg, a Manichean, and Wiligut, Hi mmler's guru, were important at a theoretical level. The political expression of the Nazi Revolution can be found in Hitler's Third Reich, 1933-45. The physical consolidation of the Revolution was through world war (the Second World War) and genoci de in concentration camps.

The political expression of the world government ha s not happened yet, but Round Table followers have made failed or half- completed attempts.

If the Global 2000 Report is policy rat her than a forecast of a likelihood, then the reduction, so far 170-350 mill ion, will be 2 billion. The aim of the revolutionary Utopia is clear; the e xtent of depopulation required is not.

Dynamic of Two British Empires Something happened to the drive for world governmen t in the course of the twentieth century. At the beginning of the cent ury, Milner, Curtis, and others tried to turn the British Empire, on which t he sun would never set, into a world government that would be an extension of the British Empire. By the 1950s, this approach had faded into the outl ook of Toynbee and Dulles: all nation-states should end so that region al blocs could come into being and eventually be transformed into a world go vernment. Towards the end of the century, the \"Rockefellerite,\" CFR v iew had taken over: there was to be an American-led world government. In shor t, the \"Rockefeller\" Empire had replaced the British Empire. All the mai n events since 1989 - the collapse of a unified Soviet Union for a fede ration in which newly autonomous countries like Turkmenistan can reach de als with Western oil companies, the demolition of the Berlin Wall, the r eunification of Europe, and the wars waged against Arab/Islamic countries - have advanced"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"302 The Syndicate an expanding American commercial oil empire: in lar ge measure, the \"Rockefeller\" Empire.

It is instructive to consider the extent to which t he \"Rockefellerite\" Syndicate may have been behind the dynamic and even ts of these revolutions. Chinese Revolution The Chinese Revolution began after the overthrow of the Manchu dynasty in 1911. \"Rockefellers\" competed with \"Rothschildit e\" Britain for China. In February 1914 Standard Oil loaned China $15m in return for a 75-year oil concession in Shensi and Chi Li, in partnership with the Chinese government. There was bitter opposition in China, J apan, and England, and \"Rockefellers\" conducted a propaganda campaign. In 1918 the Russian Communists announced that they were marching to free the people of China and in 1921 Mao declare d he was a Marxist after reading Marx's Communist Manifesto. A Russian agent was sent that year to Peking and then Shanghai to plan the F irst Congress of the Chinese Communist Party. Russians infiltrated the g overnment in 1922, and by 1924 reorganized the Chinese armed forces al ong Soviet army lines. Chiang Kai-Shek (1887-1975) was the Commanda nt and Chou En- Lai was in charge of political affairs. Chou gave i ntellectual expression to the revolution.

He ejected the Russians"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"304 The Syndicate and Mao fled and began training rebels. Chiang obst ructed the revolution as President from 1927 to 1949. By the 1920s, the Socony-Vacuum (now Mobil Oil) and Standard Oil subsidiaries had a monopoly of the sale of kerosene for the lamps they had \"philanthropically\" given the Chinese peasants, and \"Rockefellers\" sold small amounts of kerosene at more than a dollar a g allon compared with the US domestic price of five to ten cents. It was vital to \"Rockefellers\" that no oil should be produced in China, which could bri ng the price down and threaten their high-price monopoly. The Soongs and Chiang's National government saw to that. But the warlord of Shansi p rovince granted a concession to the Japanese, who drilled and found o il, threatening Standard Oil's monopoly. In 1927 Chiang's Nationalist govern ment cancelled the concession and ousted the Japanese. In 1931 the Japanese took their revenge, seizing pa rt of China and destroying \"Rockefeller\"/Standard Oil property. (In 1905 the Japanese received Kuhn, Loeb funding for the Russo-Japanese War.) In 1937 the Japanese shelled the Panay, a US gunboat that was e scorting two Standard Oil tankers. \"Rockefellers\" countered by making the Mitsuis, who with the Zaibatsu controlled Emperor Hirohito and Japan's policies, t heir agents in China. They then asked the US to rescue \"Rockefeller\" prop erty in China, which would mean declaring war on Japan. This in turn wou ld mean luring Japan into an attack on US property. The Roosevelt govern ment was subservient to the Rockefellers - as \"principal advisor\" to Pre sident Roosevelt, Nelson Rockefeller had put forward the idea of the \"New\" D eal and had urged Roosevelt to take part in the Second World War - an d J. P. Morgan's nephew Joseph Grew was appointed US Ambassador to Japan. T he Japanese were persuaded to attack the US fleet in Pearl Harbor, a nd the Americans were then able to invade China and conquer Japan. In 1949 \"Rockefellers\" delivered China to the Commu nists through their agent Gen. Marshall. After the Second World W ar, Gen. Marshall sent a special envoy to urge Chiang to include Communist s in his government. Chiang refused, so Marshall stopped American aid, w hich meant Chiang had no fuel for his tanks and planes.

In 1950 he signed a 20-year friendship treaty with Russia. In 1953 he p roposed to the Soviet Union a plan for world conquest, called \"Memorandum on a New Programme for World Revolution,\" in which every cou ntry save the US would be Communist by 1973. Chou En-Lai took this p lan to Moscow. The first phase was to be completed by 1960; Korea and Indo-China were to be under Chinese control. During the revolution's brut al physical phase, Mao is estimated to have killed 25 million Chinese. In February 1966, afraid that the Chinese Revolutio n was being derailed by the bourgeoisie, Mao mobilized the young Red Gua rds and activists to purge all \"bourgeois reactionaries\" who favored tra ditional culture or the past. The ensuing violent \"Cultural Revolution\" aga inst what was foreign and traditional was more a purge than a revolution, like Stalin's Great Purge, with young fanatics deciding who should be o n the purge list. All institutions suffered violent clashes - schools, fa ctories, and communes - and those affected by \"corrupt\" foreign or tradit ional attitudes either made public self-criticisms or were executed. The e xtreme iconoclasm amounted to a form of collective brainwashing. In 1971 Mao called on the world to \"unite and defea t the US aggressors and all their running dogs,\" but later in 1971 US-C hinese relations dramatically improved with Nixon's \"Rockefeller\"-in spired visit. Did Mao have \"Rockefellers\" in mind as the US \"running dogs ,\" and was the subtext of the Cultural Revolution his attempt to reclaim p ossession of Chinese oil? China's oilfields are in the northeast and in Sinkiang, Kansu, Tsinghai, Czechwan, Shantung, and Honan provinces. The most i mportant oil- producing area, the Ta-ching field in Heilungkiang, was discovered in the late 1950s and soon produced a third of China's oil output. China had engaged Western oil companies to develop oil de posits in the China Sea, the Yellow Sea, the Gulf of Tonkin, and the Po Hai. The principal Western oil company involved belonged to \"Rockefell ers.\" As a result of this new policy, China exported some crude oil whil e keeping most of it for herself. Deng Hsiao-ping further consolidated the Chinese Re volution, and as during the Thermidorean Reaction in the French R evolution, he led China away from world revolution to co-existence wi th the West and in the direction of the free market and privatization."},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"306 The Syndicate Vietnamese Revolution The Vietnamese Revolution is different from the oth er revolutions in this group as it was against French colonization in Indo-China, which collapsed in 1954. \"Rockefellers\" were after Vietna mese oil from 1950.

Ho Chi Minh was inspired by Marx. He gave it political expression during its conflict with America, and was in power long enough for him to be in charg e of both a political and a physical phase. Cuban Revolution The 1958 Cuban Revolution against Batista began in 1947 when Castro became a Communist. The spiritual vision was Marx's . Castro attempted a revolt with guerillas in 1953, but was captured a nd paroled. Guevara rebuilt the guerilla forces and gave intellectual e xpression to the revolution.

He was then able to train revolutionaries under Che Guevar a and Regis Debray, using Cuba as a training camp, and send them to oil -rich Latin American states to foment revolution with a view to seizing oilfields on behalf of \"Rockefellerites\" (most memorably, Bolivia, where S tandard Oil of New Jersey located oilfields in 1927; Nicaragua, El Sal vador, Guatemala, and the Honduras). Guevara fought in Bolivia in 1966 an d was executed there in 1967. In the 1960s and 1970s Castro sent troops to Ghana, Algeria, Morocco, and the Congo, and he sent 20,000 troops to Angola in 1975 and 16,000 troops to Ethiopia a year later. By 1980 he had mor e than a thousand troops in a dozen countries and had become a major destabi lizing force. Did he have Syndicate masters? Castro's long tenure of pow er has meant that he has presided over both political and physical/conso lidation phases - the first extreme, the second more moderate.

After Colonel Nasser's overthrow of King Farouk, his puppet Gen. Naguib gave the revolution political expression with his pro-Russia n Arab Socialism. In 1954 Nasser emerged from the shadows to assume f ull political power, which he consolidated all through the Soviet -backed extremism of the Suez crisis and the wars with Israel. To wha t extent did he have \"Rockefellerite\" assistance? After Nasser Egypt passed to Sadat, one of the 12 F ree Officers who helped carry out the 1952 coup, until he was assassinated for agreeing to peace with Israel. Egypt has now settled back into a comf ortable relationship with the West and has declared war on the Islamic B rotherhood. Iraqi Revolution The Iraqi Revolution took its inspiration from Marx and Colonel Nasser. After the overthrow and murder of King Faisal, the military dictator General Kassem, who had been trained in Russia, gave the re volution political expression. He moved troops to Iraq's border with K uwait and had designs on Kuwaiti oil. His revolution torpedoed the Baghda d Pact. To what extent did he have \"Rockefellerite\" assistance? The brutal , physical phase has been under Saddam Hussein. He was supported by the \"Rockefellerite\" Syndicate - armed by Donald Rumsfeld - at the begin ning of the Iran- Iraq war. Libyan Revolution The Libyan Revolution also took inspiration from Ma rx and Colonel Nasser. As in the case of Egypt, there were 12 Free Officers. Gaddafi and the other n members of the original Revolutionary C ommand Council discussed the idea of the revolution in 1956 at the time of Suez when they were on a school picnic. They all agreed to go into the army and work for revolution. Later they regarded themselves as pan-A rab Nasserites, and the intellectual expression of the revolutionary id ea took place between 1956 and 1969. Rich oil deposits had been discovere d in Libya.

After Nass er's death in 1970, Gaddafi assumed the mantle of the radical Arab cause. He ga ve the terrorist Carlos a base in Libya; in 1975 Carlos took Sheikh Yamani, the Saudi-Arabian oil minister, hostage in Vienna, having been assisted i n his preparations by members of Libyan intelligence. Did \"Rockefellers\" control Gaddafi (and keep him in power) via the Soviet Union? Did the pr o-Soviet Gaddafi back \"Rockefellerite\" interests in Libya? He sided with Russia against the West and armed the IRA. There have been executions but t he brutal phase has not really happened in the same way that it happene d in Iraq or in China. Nevertheless, like Ho Chi Minh and Castro, Gaddafi has presided over both political and physical phases, and as a result of h is arms policy Libya was expected to be a nuclear power by 2005. Following h is dramatic renunciation of weapons of mass destruction, Gaddafi has been re habilitated to oversee the growing African Union/United States of Africa. Cambodian Revolution The origins of the Cambodian or Kampuchean revoluti on can be found in 1970, near the end of the Vietnam War, when the pro -US Lon Nol deposed Prince Sihanouk, the ruler since 1941. Did both men have \"Rockefellerite\" assistance? In 1975 his government was overthrown b y the Chinese- backed Khmers Rouges under Pol Pot, who exterminate d between 1.7 and 2.2 million people - or 3 to 4 million according to some - by driving them out of cities into the countryside. Iranian Revolution The 1978 Iranian Revolution, which deposed the \"Roc kefellerite\" Shah, was overtly an Islamic one. Was the driving force behin d it in fact a Syndicate one: \"Rockefellers\" Chase Manhattan bank and BP, wh ich wanted to seize the Iranian oilfields, perhaps by intriguing an Iran-Iraq war and supporting Saddam Hussein? Disciples of Khomeini, s uch as Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, gave it intellectual expression .

After the shock of a military blow, which arrests g rowth (stage 14) there is a counterthrust and expansion into global empire (s tage 15). In my view, the shock that befell Rome was the Celts' capture of Ro me in 390 BC; the shock that befell America was the invasion of the secessi onist Confederacy in 1861- 2, which led to the American Civil War. In my view the North American civilization, recently shocked by defeat in Vietnam and more recently by the September 11 attacks, is in the same stage the Roman civilization was in after the shock of Hannibal's military blow at L ake Trasimene in 217 BC before it had an empire. Rome then had many centuri es ahead of her. In my view, so has America. In short, America has just be gun a globalist phase, the equivalent of Rome's expansion into empire. I demonstrated that the European civilization was p assing from a period of de-colonization to stage 43, which involves loss of national sovereignty to a secularizing conglomerate that is a union (i.e . the coming United States of Europe). The Arab civilization, on the ot her hand, is further on, in stage 46, having emerged from a period in which all its nation-states lost their sovereignty to the European colonial emp ires to re-assert its sovereignty through an attempt at counterthrust. In my study, which appeared two years before Samuel Huntingdon's The Clash of Civilizations, I predicted a clash bet ween the North American and European civilizations on the one hand and mili tant Islam within the Arab civilization on the other. In The Fire and the Stones I predicted that there w ould be conflict between the West and the Arab civilization: \"Viewed from 19 91 AD, the chief threat to the European and North American civilizations, t hen, is Islam, both from the ex-Khanate Soviet Islam which can be expec ted to secede from the Soviet Union and join the coming Federation of Islamic States, and from a revivified, fanatical, nuclear-armed Arab ci vilization which is determined to eliminate Israel.\" This was written t wo years before Samuel Huntington's The Clash of Civilizations and the Rem aking of World Order appeared.

During the last 50 years, the Arab civilization has asserted itself against the W est. Arab nationalism was responsible for seizing the Suez Canal in 1956, for using the oil weapon against the West in 1973, and arousing worldwide an ti-Western Islamic fervor through the Iranian Revolution in 1979. Such political, economic, and religious manifestati ons of Islamic anti- Westernism suggest that though he did not rule a co untry, bin Laden was in the tradition of Nasser, Ayatollah Khomeini, and Sa ddam Hussein. During the last 50 years Islam has seethed with internal a nd external conflicts: the eight-year-long Iran-Iraq war; Syria's occupati on of Lebanon; Iraq's attack on Kuwait; murders of Christians in Sudan, E gypt, Nigeria, and Pakistan; conflicts between Moslems and Moslems in Egypt and Algeria; and Moslem attacks on the Chinese, Indians, and Rus sians. The attack on America must be seen within this cont ext. The aim of the Syndicate's New World Order and PNAC is to brin g pressure to bear on the North American civilization to suppress expr essions of Islamic anti-Western resurgence within the Arab civilizatio n. Islamic insurgency could be expected to continue after the deaths of b in Laden and Saddam Hussein and even if Israel were handed over to the Arabs. Such insurgency is the continuation of \"anti-Zionism,\" \"anti-Wester nism,\" and \"anti- Americanism,\" which have been rife since the First World War, when the sleeping giant stirred over the creation of Israel. The West is in denial if it disregards this historical perspective. Objectively, the 2001 conflict between the US and t he Taliban cannot be anything other than a conflict between the leaders of the North American civilization and a section of the Arab civilization embodied by the Taliban and their Arab and Pakistani followers and al-Qaeda allies. A massacre in a Catholic church in Bahawalpur that left 18 dea d sought to polarize the conflict into \"Moslems versus Christians,\" grou pings the Crusaders would have understood.

On the evidence of what has been said publicly by US government officials, influential figures in the CF R do not think in terms of separate civilizations which can clash - even th ough bin Laden spoke for a vast number of Arabs by calling for global Islami c law, which must bring about a clash with the Christian West - but (as we have seen) in terms of a \"Global Coalition,\" with many nation-states joining a global alliance. Despite these two attempts to interpret or \"spin\" t he conflict to the advantage of either side, the conflict is essential ly an encounter between two civilizations. A clash need not be a head-on-co llision; it can be a side-on glancing blow, as when two cars bump into e ach other when converging side by side. The head-on collision scen ario is one in which anti-Islamic factions within the North American civ ilization (or New World Order) clash with the anti-Western (or anti-C hristian) factions within the Arab civilization. The side-on glancing blow scenario may be a truer representation of the encounter. The conflict , officially over weapons of mass destruction but really about oil, has provo ked the involvement of the rank-and-file of the two civilizations, not jus t the anti-Islamic and anti- Western factions. From my comparative study I stated a law, that in a ny clash between civilizations, the younger always triumphs. The Ara b civilization is three- quarters through (in stage 46 of the 61 stages), an d is slightly older than the European civilization (currently entering stage 43, a union). The quarter-through North American civilization, formal ly founded with the founding of the Jamestown Settlement in 1607, can t herefore be expected to triumph in clashes with the Arab civilization. It follows that the imminent collapse of the North American civilization, predicted in Paul Kennedy's The Rise and Fall of th e Great Powers, could not be anticipated as a result of the torching of the T win Towers of the World Trade Center. Nor could it be expected that young N orth America would lose a war against older Islam in Afghanistan. In f act the episode rallied America's spirit of defiance and strengthened her r esolve and resilience.

The main threat is a"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"Appendices 313 reported agenda for the last American election to b e in 2016, 2 after which, the intention is, there will be a world government and all nation-states will have ceased to exist.

The \"Rockefellerit e\" revolutions throughout most of the twentieth century were instrumental in taking America to its present position of supremacy and superpowerdom, bu t the American people will not allow the American state to be shut down once they are in possession of the facts. Knowledge of the situation will give the American people strength, and be their salvation. Is Europe also threatened from within? In my compar ative study I predicted the end of Soviet Communism in 1991 and t he beginning of a United States of Europe in 1997. Through \"Rothschil ds'\" influence, full European integration is part-and-parcel of the Bild erberg agenda. Both \"Rockefellerite\" and \"Rothschildite\" factions withi n the Syndicate have made common cause to remove Europe's independence a nd place Europe under a coming world government. The internal threa t to North America is also an internal threat to Europe. The New World Order is inevitable. In good hands, a s a democracy serving and therefore beneath the North American an d European civilizations, a Pax Americana that extends round E urope's borders and across the world, it is welcome. It can do immense good in preserving the peace and improving humankind's lot. In the wrong h ands - if it were a dictatorship above the North American and Europea n civilizations that demanded population reduction - it would be a night mare. From my research into the subject it has become cle ar that true revolutions take place within civilizations; they a re not imposed from without. Moreover, they act as corrective adjustmen ts to civilizations; they do not shut them down or seek to control them. In t he same way the New World Order arose as a stage within the North Ameri can civilization. So long as it remains a supportive dynamo of the North American civilization's continuing growth and spreading of democracy by pea ceful, lawful means, it is a good thing, depending on the degree of bene volence it exercises towards other nation-states.

If the North American civilization and its presiden t can retain national independence despite the pressures from global inte rnationalism, the North American civilization can prosper and go from strength to strength. If as a result of a military blow as shocking as Ha nnibal's first victory was to Rome, the North American civilization caves in t o the globalist CFR within it and allows itself to lose its national in dependence, then the North American civilization will have broken down. In my comparative study, I locate the breakdown of a civilization at the end of its growth. The North American civilization is not at the end of its growth. Breakdown takes place when there is a trans fer of power from the people who have hitherto ruled a civilization t o a \"new people\" who follow a heresy. The turning point is a military bl ow, which destroys the confidence of the old people and secularizes their religion, which ritualizes their experience of the Fire or Light. In Rome's case, the breakdown did not occur with Ha nnibal, who was eventually defeated, but with the Roman defeat by t he external Germanic tribes, the Cimbri and Teutones who defeated a Roma n army in 113 BC. This blow helped to encourage the new heresy of the deified leader, which was transmitted to the Caesarian principate, the ne w people. The old Roman religion of Jupiter and Apollo gave way to th is new heresy and to the new eastern cults of Cybele, Dionysus, and Mith ras. In North America's case, the breakdown will not occ ur as a result of the Islamic attack on New York and Washington, which ma y have a strong internal motivation, but as a result of a future de feat at the hands of external barbarian invaders and occupiers. The Universalist \"Heresy\" A \"heresy\" is a non-orthodox sect that has the pote ntial to develop into a religion. Just as Christianity was once a heresy within Judaism, so the \"heresy\" of Universalism (an internationalist s piritual vision that is acceptable to all mankind, not just Christians or M oslems) may one day replace Christianity. We are moving towards a time when the free, indepen dent, and nationalist \"old people\" of the North American civi lization may be replaced by a globalist \"new people\" who bring in a heresy that replaces the orthodoxy (orthodox Christianity). This \"new pe ople\" will either"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"Appendices 315 work within the North American civilization to revi vify it, as the Caesars revivified Rome through the Roman Empire where Chri stianity was itself a \"heresy\" emerging from within Judaism, or the \"new people,\" Americans who think globally, can seek to take the North Amer ican civilization into a world empire so that it flows underground until i t eventually surfaces again as itself, the North American civilization. My comparative study shows that the first of these two possibilities is what has happened in all previous civilizations, an d that the second would break the mold, and is without precedent. For this reason it is unlikely to succeed. In short, the ascendancy of the North Amer ican civilization will depend on its retaining control over its supporters and creative dynamo, and not surrendering to them. I cannot emphasize this point enough, and I close w ith a warning. The North American civilization has a choice. It can ei ther continue to be part of the pattern of civilizations I have unfolded in The Fire and the Stones, to which revolutions contribute. Or it can subordin ate itself to a world government that is not a part of any civilization, and which is therefore a completely untried international experiment that is unlikely to succeed for long. Europe and the North American Civilization The European civilization, too, has a choice. It is entering a union with a single currency. My comparative study shows that th e stage of union (stage 43) is always accompanied by Universalism and a yea rning for the lost past of the civilization - in the case of Britain, for the Tudor-Renaissance time - and for a revival of cultural purity. The Eu ropean soul is at present divided between the old traditional, national cultu re and the new union it has just joined. This division reveals itself as a fissure in the soul, and as self-division, to which it is important to bring un ity. If the North American civilization remains independ ent, the United States of Europe will still cease to be a Europe of nation-states in each of which there is a union stage, and will become a ful ly integrated union as has happened to all the other civilizations that ha ve reached stage 43.

Will there be a good New World Order or a bad one? Will there be a good United States of Europe or a bad one? Will we retain our separate cultures or be in the melting-pot? I have seen the continuing ascendancy of the North American civilization and, for a shorter span, of the Europe an Union, and I answer both questions optimistically. I therefore see all the revolutions we have been studying not as flowing into one-world governm ent, as the Syndicate have seen them, an end they appear to have sought t o intrigue, but as means of bringing speedy transformations to their c ivilizations which are needed urgently and which have to take place abrupt ly. The visions of those who began the revolutions tran sformed their civilizations; the massacres perpetrated by those w ho corrupted the revolutions scarred their civilizations while the c orrective adjustments were being made. Revolutions are within civilizatio ns and help them to change constructively. They are not destructive mec hanisms that allow Lucifer to be held up as ruler of the world. Appendix 4: The Syndicate's New World Order as a gl obal phase in the evolution of the North American civili zation In the West we have come to accept a view of modern global history in which the USA plays an increasingly dominant role. According to this view, the US liberated itself with the aid of the French in the eighteenth century (just as the British had liberated themselves with the aid of the Dutch in 1688). Since then the US has driven global liberati on to democracy for more than a hundred years. The US brought freedom t o Cuba in 1898 when the US battleship Maine exploded in Havana Har bor, and freedom to France and Germany from Prussian militarism in 1 917, Nazi occupation in 1944, and Soviet occupation from the mid-1940s t o the late 1980s. As a result of US activity, democracy has spread to mo st of the former Soviet countries and all the Warsaw Pact nations, which ar e now democracies, and democracy is spreading in Africa: in 2003, 17 o f 54 African nations were democracies. US support for foreign revolution s has been a vital part of the long-term plan to bring liberty and democrac y to the entire world. In fact, the secret history of the West in the twen tieth century was the hidden progress to a one-world government, the New World Order, through"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"Appendices 317 revolutions that have dismantled the old Europe, Mi ddle and Far East. The Spanish Civil War, for instance, was an attempted C ommunist revolution. There have been revolutions in China, Vietnam, Cuba , Egypt, Iraq, Libya, and Iran. The revolutions have suddenly happened; t heir causes remain something of a mystery, their consequences enormous . It has dawned on many that the startling changes in Europe following 1989, which saw the structures of Communism dismant led and Western Europe turn Socialist, were in fact no accident but had been planned. The Cold War did not end abruptly because the Russians collapsed. Rather, it gave way to a new scenario that was orchestrated. All the main revolutions (the English, French, Amer ican, and Russian Revolutions) have happened within a civilization - the European, North American, and Byzantine-Russian civilizations - and the New World Order Revolution is no exception. All civilizations have had a global phase - as did the Roman civilization whose territorial expansion gave Rome hegemony over the western Mediterranean (c341-218 BC) and later over much of the known world (c30 BC-AD 270). There are therefore strong reasons for regarding the New World Order Revolution as being created by a wo rld government phase within the North American civilization. The r ationale for this view - that the emerging world-wide phase of civilizatio n is a consequence of a development or phase within the North American civilization - is that there has never been a world government before and that if it does happen it will be a result of pressure from the onl y surviving superpower, the US, and its supporting agencies, the UN, the CF R, and the Trilateral Commission. To some extent this movement towards a world cultur e is a natural and inevitable consequence of an organic process within a civilization. Just as the Roman civilization achieved a world phase under Augustus, which ruled the known world including past empires (the E gyptian, Carthaginian, Greek, et al.), so the North American civilization will achieve a world phase that will create an American-led world government. This will be a result of an American initiative and will include the past em pires of the European nations, including Great Britain and the USSR. On this view, just as the Roman Empire absorbed the old Greek Empire, so the American-led world government will absorb th e former European Empires including the British Empire (and the forme r colonies in their"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"318 The Syndicate post-liberation-movement states) within a federal w orld structure, a United States of the World. De-colonization has fos tered multiculturalism throughout the world - especially in India and Afri ca where different races and religions co-exist - and a new universalist wor ld government will be multicultural while focusing on the indigenous cult ures of local regions. Prominent Europeans who have contributed to the wor ld government, such as the Rothschilds, will therefore be seen as contributors to the creation of a global phase in the North American ci vilization, as did refugee scientists like Einstein and von Braun who gave the ir expertise, honed under the Nazis, to the US. In the same way, the Br itish Rothschilds, German Jewish economic migrants from Frankfurt, hel ped create the British Empire after Waterloo. We should therefore reject the view that \"Rothschil ds\" are creating the world government for the European civilization, tha t the CFR is under the RIIA and beholden to the English Queen, who is ther efore the originating force of a world government. Clearly the British Co mmonwealth would be subsumed in a world government and the Queen is the refore a force to be reckoned with, but we cannot regard a world governm ent as originating in Europe or Great Britain, with America subservien t to London. It may have been like that in 1900, it is not like that no w. Such a view would be a misreading of twentieth-century history. The only other alternative to the US-led view is to see all civilizations as coming to an end in world government, which will therefore not be a phase (lasting perhaps 100 years on past preceden t) but a permanent creation. This view entails maintaining that all re volutions have advanced the Freemasonic Luciferian one-world global dictato rship - or \"Christ's\" free global democracy - and that the new stage will be a permanent entity, unlike the Roman Empire and all the other universal ist empires that have ever been. The End of History? A form of such a view has recently been advanced by Francis Fukuyama, a New World Order apologist and policy-planner with the US State Department in Bush's administration. When he read i n a speech by Gorbachev in 1988 that socialism equals competition , he rang a friend and said of the global triumph of capitalism, \"If this is true we've reached the end of history\" - in the sense that history, understood as a single evolutionary"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"Appendices 319 process that includes all peoples, has reached an e nd in liberal democracy (competitive socialism) and can go no further, havi ng freed itself from the Hegelian dialectic and contradiction (i.e. competit ion versus the workers leading to a synthesis, socialism). Hegel had claim ed that history ended in 1806 when revolutionary France under Napoleon be at the Prussians at Jena and ensured that the rights of man would trium ph. Fukuyama wrote an essay The National Interest in 1989 and then a b ook, The End of History and the Last Man in 1992. 3 Liberal democracy and market-oriented economic orde r are the only possibilities for modern societies and lead to the non-ideological outlook of Clinton and Blair; liberal democracies do not fi ght each other. Or so the theory goes. Therefore history as a process from lo wer to higher forms of human social organization has ended. Take Fukuya ma's ideas further, and he is saying that the New World Order is a perm anent world liberal democracy into which all civilizations have poured their identity, emptying themselves of all residual nationalism: the world g overnment as a global democracy not attached to, and indeed, independent of, all particular nation-states. This view has been adopted by the British historian Andrew Roberts in an article in the Daily Telegraph of October 9, 200 0, which argues that the fall of Milosovic in Serbia proves that capitalist liberal democracy has finally swept the globe and is the \"final form of human gov ernment,\" \"the end of history.\" Arguing that since 1989 capitalist libera l democracy has replaced authoritarianism in Nicaragua, Chile, Ecuador, Guat emala, South Africa, Sierra Leone, Taiwan, Fiji, Mongolia, the Baltic st ates, Bangladesh, Poland, Croatia, Slovenia, Kenya, Armenia, Albania, Hondura s, and Algeria - even \"Rockefellers\" Saudi-Arabia has had to give its sub jects new constitutional rights since the Gulf War - Roberts claims that the only countries that deny the victory of global liberal capitalist democracy, \"the former American President Woodrow Wilson's dream of 1918,\" are pers onal fiefdoms of anti-Americanism: Castro's Cuba, Gaddafi's Libya, K im's North Korea, Saddam's Iraq, and of course China. The headline of the article screamed Fukuyama was right about the rise and rise of capit alism.\" The article, staggeringly, claims that the end-state of history has been reached: global democracy, which will be world-wide and for all tim e.

In short, capitalism is triumphing globally because of the world government lobby, the \"Rockefellerite\"-Bilderberg S yndicate. In fact, global capitalism is a smokescreen for the Syndicate's pie cemeal achievement of a world government by stealth. Global liberal capit alist democracy is not a permanent end-state but a stage in the history of the North American civilization, a counterpart to the Roman civilizati on's global stage when Rome ruled the world. Global liberal capitalist democracy will no more be \"for all time\" than was the Roman Empire. All empires are prone to the illusion that they will last a thousand years - including the German T hird Reich and the British Empire on which the sun would never set - a nd the coming world empire is no exception in being immune from this il lusion, or, rather, delusion. Heady statements that history has ended s hould be treated with great suspicion. History never ends; the pattern of civilizations continues to unfold as the stages of living civilizations ech o the similar stages of civilizations that have died. Careful thought reveals further difficulties with F ukuyama's view. It is like Marx's view of history: too materialistic. It does not take account of Hegel's life of the spirit. Can we really rule o ut the possibility that nationalism will re-emerge somewhere for all time? Can we rule out the consequences of mass migration? Do we really believ e that there will be optimism forever, and no more nasty events like the two world wars that blew a hole in the Utopian optimism of 1910 and 191 9? Weishaupt's destructive agenda still has followers - notably, the Syndicate. America owes more than $7.5 trillion to the Syndicate-controlled Federal Reserve System, much of it to \"Rockefellers ,\" and if any of this were called in America would have to withdraw her f orces worldwide."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"Appendices 321 Nuclear proliferation has been contained only so fa r - the first Iraq War set back Saddam's attempts to become a nuclear power - and the anticipated population explosion to 10 billion by 2030 may crea te destabilization, poverty, and militarization. The south may threaten the north with long- range nuclear weapons. May there not be a New World Disorder rather than a New World Order? Such a view has been expressed by the Frenchman Pie rre Lellouche, foreign policy advisor to Jacques Chirac in The New World, From The Order of Yalta to the Disorder of Nations. 4 A for-all-time world government can be ruled out; t here will be no permanent breaking of the mold. But a world governm ent can be achieved for a while, as a phase. I have argued elsewhere 5 that this is to be expected in the next phase of the North American civilizatio n. America's central bank (the Syndicate-dominated Federal Reserve Syste m) wants it, and is therefore unlikely to have plans to call in America 's overdraft of more than $7.5 trillion. Another former senior advisor to the White House ha s produced a new apology for the New World Order. Philip Bobbitt in The Shield of Achilles maintains that the nation-state, successor to the nineteenth- century imperial state, is ending and being replace d by the market state, a new order that will embrace human rights, limit w eapons of mass destruction, adjust to global and transitional thre ats (damage to the environment, migration, population expansion, disea se and famine), and accommodate a world economic regime and communicati ons network. The consequences of the market state - that governm ents are more driven by markets than morality - have been taken u p by Britain's new Archbishop of Canterbury. Immanuel Wallerstein 6 sees the US as having begun to suffer in 1967 from the same imperial overstretch that caused decl ine in Venice around 1500 in Holland around 1660, and in Britain around 1873. Paul Kennedy saw America as a victim of military top-heavy imper ial overstretch in The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers 7 and likely to suffer the same problem as Philip II's Spain, Nicholas II's Russia, and Hit ler's Germany, but he did not appreciate that the decline in America's share of the world's GNP is not continuous, as has been shown by Charles Wolf of the Rand Corporation, 8 who demonstrates that it has remained constant in the region of 22-24%."},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"322 The Syndicate The US's World Dominance Meanwhile the co-founder of PNAC, Robert Kagan, arg ues in a short book, Paradise and Power, that the US and Europe ar e diverging. Recoiling from the bloodshed of two world wars, Europe is ben t on creating a post- modern peaceful paradise and sees the US as high-ha nded, unilateralist, and recklessly belligerent. The US, a hyperpuissanc e (a term coined by Hubert Vedrine, French foreign minister during the Clinton years), sees Europe as spent, unserious, and weak. There is a po wer gap, and the US affords Europe military protection while Europe con ducts its peaceful experiment in European union. During the Cold War t he term \"the West\" represented a unified alternative to Communism. Now , the US is achieving a hegemony to defend and advance international free dom and order. As Bush Jr. put it in a speech on April 23, 2003, \" We believe in peace, we understand we have an obligation to keep our nat ion secure ... We have applied our might in the name of peace and of freed om.\" The US sees itself as defending the democratic universal values enshrined in the UN's Universal Declaration of Rights, to which the whole world has signed up. This means opposing tyrannical regimes everywhere. A world dominated by the US may appear to be unipol ar. In fact it has moved from being bipolar (with the US and USSR at o pposite poles) towards being more multipolar with Russia, China, n uclear India, and Europe all becoming economic, political, and milita ry powers in their own right - in which three regional blocs stand out : Europe (including Russia), the American hemisphere, and East Asia. A world government would ostensibly diffuse power and create a polyarc hy, in which there are many spheres of influence without alignment to any central agency. This multipolar, polyarchist tendency would be pres ent under a world government, and the US would still be powerful - a superpower - in relation to other states. 9 Multipolarity is within the context of unipolarity . What would be the relationship between the US, whic h now has a tendency to world hegemony, and the New World Order formed round the UN? During the last years of Clinton's presidency, the concept was clear. Overtly the US would place itself under the New Wor ld Order, the controller of all oil-and-money power, as would all nation-sta tes. The sovereignty of all nation-states would be ended in every part of t he world, and all human beings would be first and foremost citizens of the world (\"cosmopolitans\" with roots in their local hometown).

But the funding of the world government would come principally from the surviving superpower, the US, through its contr olling agency the CFR, and it would be clear who was in charge. Bush Jr. a sked Congress for over $74b to fund the war against Iraq, and it was clear who was in charge of the world government's drive against Saddam Hussein . It would be as if Augustus's Rome had hosted a UN-like organization f or representatives of all the known world, who had contributed to Roma n legions composed of various nationalities; had sent them out, funded the lion's share, and, as its most influential member, manipulated peace-k eeping to achieve Roman ends. Nationalists, Globalists, and Universalists The main tension of our time is between the globali sts and the nationalists. In 1991 President Bush Sr. was opposed for the Repu blican nomination by Pat Buchanan, a typical nation-stater, who said of the President in his New Hampshire speech announcing his candidacy (Dece mber 10): \"He is a globalist and we are nationalists. He believes in some Pax Universalis; we believe in the Old Republic. He would put America's wealth and power at the service of some vague New World Order; we will put America first.\" The globalists, on the other hand, see the nation-s taters as living in the world of the past, the world of the old order. As H itler put it: \"The present world is near its end. Our only task is to sack it. \" The twenty-first-century globalists no longer seek to sack the old world, bu t to dismantle it area by area, gradually, until a world government is in place. But whereas the nation-staters are open and forthright in their aim s and philosophy, the globalists have preferred stealth, secrecy, and dec eption. A globalist world empire is universalist (with a sm all \"u,\" in the sense that it geographically covers the whole globe but i s not spiritual). Western globalists see liberal democracy as becoming a univ ersalist empire (with a small \"u\"). (To Moslems such a \"universalis m\" would be a new imperialism, which is why bin Laden called for a Mo slem \"universalist\" world empire.) Absolute Universalism (with a capita l \"U,\" the geographical spread with a spiritual vision acceptable to all hu mankind, not just to Moslems) involves a world government and world lead ers totally removed from all civilizations.

The CFR may become to some de gree accountable to the world public. It is this limited universalism that will form the world government. The more such a world government is linked dynastically to the Syndicate, the more Luciferian it will be and the more malevolent will be its New World Order. The more it frees itself from the Syndicate and becomes publicly accountable, the more Christ-like it will be and th e more benign its New World Order. Philosophical (true) Universalism sees each human b eing from all perspectives - including the spiritual and religiou s as well as the political. Philosophical Universalism therefore sees humankind in relation to the metaphysical Light from which (according to the tradition of many religions) the created universe came. Philosophical (true) Universalism holds that all human beings are equal in relation t o the Light that can fill their souls like one sun that shines on all th e phenomena of Nature. Secular political universalism is only a pale shado w of metaphysical Universalism, the philosophy of the twenty-first ce ntury and of the start of the new millennium."},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"NOTE TO THE READER ON THE QUALITY OF THE SOURCES I have approached my sources with certain requireme nts. I have required that they should show evidence of years, if not dec ades, of deep thinking in this area, impressive research, and a measure of balance and, where possible, impartiality. I have borne in mind that w hat has driven people to spend decades researching has often been growing indignation and outrage, and that sometimes these feelings have col ored the impartiality of their work. A word about the sources that crop up most often. I could find alternative sources for all their points, but have narrowed the field to assist the reader. All these have to be seen in the round. Sutton is very sound and scrupulous, and gives all his sources. His range is limited: he focuses on Wall Street's funding of the Bolshevik Revolution and Hitler. Rivera and Daniel are both extremely well informed, but although they try to disguise it both write from a Christian posi tion. Rivera ends before Gorbachev and (though he manages to mention him) so does Daniel. On his own admission Rivera presents \"a series of f iles\" \"crammed with facts\" that have taken hundreds of hours of researc h to assemble, but does not annotate and therefore does not give us his sou rce for each point. He draws extensively on Quigley's Anglo-American Estab lishment. Daniel sees contemporary history as a series of wars between Fr eemasonic sects, and while he adds a valuable additional perspective he risks being thought to say that the Second World War (for instance) was ex clusively Masonic in its origin and development. Coleman, an ex-MI6 officer, writes with inside know ledge; his main book is a gigantic leak, the only one by an ex-MI6 officer of its kind. Or is it a misreading? I have relegated his main perce ption (that there is 325"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"326 The Syndicate a Committee of 300) to these Notes, as it is not co rroborated by other authoritative sources. As with all such predominant ly single-source books, caution should be exercised along with open- mindedness at the revelations. Coleman stops around the Gulf War. Mullins wrote his main work in 1984. He was origina lly funded by the poet Ezra Pound to look into the actions of the Syn dicate (not his word) that resulted in Pound's incarceration. His researc h made some valuable inroads. Josephson was very well informed but had a tendentious (anti- Rockefeller) bent and stops in the 1950s. Armstrong is extremely authoritative on the Rothsch ild finances of the nineteenth century, but also had a tendentious bent : he stops in 1940, and overestimates the Jewish involvement in the Second World War. Were he writing today he would have a different view of his time. All are very knowledgeable but their books reveal s tructural weaknesses. Events pop up in unexpected places, and they do not always make it easy for the reader. All except for the last two owe a d ebt to Quigley, who in Tragedy and Hope surveyed the twentieth century in 1350 pages, and stops in 1964. His approach is very academic, and p laces this field within mainstream contemporary history. By connecting to t he broad sweep he sacrifices detail, and many of the events in thi s book are missing in Quigley's. However, his account of the Round Table is excellent, although the focus is narrow in relation to the sweep of thi s work. The Internet is a valuable source, especially for v ery recent events, but is of varying quality. I have steered clear of the cranky sites. I have only recommended websites after satisfying myself that t he writer is writing with authority, expertise, and knowledge, whether f inancial, historical, or political.

The last 20 years have seen some dramatic progress toward world government. I have g one to some pains to ground the thesis and argument of the book in fact. Hence the many notes. However, a work of this scope is necessarily also i nterpretative. I have tried to achieve a balance between fact and interpretatio n, and have consciously avoided speculation, leaving it to the reader to dr aw conclusions.

The n OPEC members are: Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qata r, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Venezuela. The OPEC countries made ten announce ments of cuts in production and/or exports between 1999 and 2002, to keep the p rice of oil high and conserve reserves. Russia, which has attended many of OPEC's meetings since 1997, has made three commitments to cut production and/or exports, but there is ambiguity in Russia's statements. In 2002 production in Russia and the st ates bordering the Caspian Sea, and in China, was expected to rise during the next two years, and it seemed that Russia may become the world's leading oil producer.

Major World Oil Producers: Proven Crude Oil Reserve s (2003) and Total Oil Production (2002). Sources: EIA and Oil and Gas Journal. 3. Bureau of Economics, Analysis, www.bea.doc.gov/bea/ di1.htm The US was the world's largest oil producer in 2002 because of a refinery gain of 750,000 b/d. 24% of the country's oil was produced in Alaska. The US was easily the world's largest consumer of oil, with 25.39% of the world's consumption, four times more than the second largest, China, which has four times the US's population. The US consumes its own oil, which accounts for more than 45% of its total consumption; and imports nearly 55% of its total consumption. Much o f this was supplied by four or five countries: 15% from Canada, 14% from Saudi Arabia a nd Venezuela, 12% from Mexico, 5-6% from Iraq. More precise figures suggest that t he US is a net oil importer of 52% of its requirements. See Table 1. See EIA (Energy Information Administration), http:/ /www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/ topworldtables1_2.html The US's proven oil reserves have fallen from 36.5b barrels in 1981 to 30.4b barrels"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"336 The Syndicate in 2002. NAFTA's reserves fell from 102b barrels to 64.8b barrels due to excessive US consumption. If the US were to rely solely on NAFTA North America would be dry in less than ten years from the end of 2002. The table on p. 2 shows that the US had only seven years of oil left from the supply known to exist in 1999, not taking account of new f inds. On the basis of the 1999 prediction, the US was set to run out of oil in 200 6 if there were no new finds. For NAFTA see website http://www.crikey.com.au/business /2003/01/31-oilandiraq.print. html. For the table on p. 2 see Office of Transportation Technologies' see http://www.ott. doe.gov/facts/archives/fotw125.shtml The US monthly trade deficit climbed to $41.77b for October 2003, from a deficit of $41.34b in September 2003. For the 2003 year the US trade deficit in goods and services was running at an annual rate of $490.8b, far more than 2002's record $418.04b. The October 2003 trade report showed that while US expo rts to China increased ($2.87b), imports from China were $16.43b - a trade deficit f or the month of $13.57b. See http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/trade/200 3-12-12-october-trade_x.htm As regards the UK, in 2002 the UK was the tenth lar gest world oil producer, with 2.55m barrels per day. The UK was the twelfth large st world oil net exporter, with 0.83m b/d. Oil exports brought in some £ 400m p.a. The United Kingdom exports most of its high-quality crude oil and imports cheaper, lower-q uality crude oils for refining (mainly from the Middle East). The UK is the thirteenth lar gest consumer of oil in the world, and has the twenty-fourth largest oil reserves (4.7b ba rrels). But all is not as well as it seems. The North Sea ( which the UK shares with Norway) is a 'mature' oil and natural gas area. Few large discov eries are likely to be made. As in the case of Norway, stocks of oil and natural gas are runnin g out. The UK's production declined from a high of 2.95m b/d in 1999 to 2.55m b/d (or 2 .53m b/d) in 2002. Production was expected to decline further in 2003. The domestic U K oil and gas industries are expected to decline and UK reserves to be depleted in the co ming decade. See http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/uk.html The UK faced industrial problems. Following the rep lacing of Britain's coal industry by imports from abroad, nuclear reactors were set t o be decommissioned and nuclear electricity generation was to be replaced by wind-t urbines, with the possibility of nuclear-generated electricity being imported from F rance. In East Anglia, Sizewell and Dungeness were set to be decommissioned in 2006; Br adwell was closed in 2002. With no clear indications as to their replacement, black -outs or rationed electricity could not be ruled out. The prospect was that much of the UK's oil and gas would come from Russia and be at risk from terrorist targeting or political inter ference. Wind, wave and solar power, and hot-rock heating, were being explored as alternativ es. Have we all moved from a fossil to a solar century? See article in the Western Morning News, 'Solar Century a 'Great Chance for Business', January 14, 2004. See http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/displayNode .jsp?nodeId=103354&comm and=displayContent&sourceNode=10331&contentPK=84885 58 for this and the previous paragraph. The table on p. 2 shows that the UK had five years' oil left in 1999 if there were no new finds, i.e. that the UK's oil was due to run out in 2004 if there were no new finds. In September 2003 the UK suffered its first monthly oil trade deficit since 1991. This"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"Notes I Sources 337 was later amended to a small surplus. Usually the U K's monthly oil surplus has been around £ 400m. By 2030 the swing from net oil exports to net oil imports would burden the balance of trade by £20-25b p.a., or possibly a s much as £25-30b p.a., and add 65- 85% to the UK's trade deficit. See Reuters article 'Analysis - UK Faces Future Without North Sea Oil', see website: http://www.forbes.com/markets/newswire/2004/01/14/r tr1210361.html for this and previous paragraph. The £2.0-£25b and 65-85% figure s came from Peter Odell, Profes- sor Emeritus at Rotterdam's Erasmus University. North Sea oil has contributed hundreds of billions of pounds to the UK economy since 1980. When the UK's oilwells run dry there wi ll be an impact on tax revenues, which have received over £200b from oil since the l ate 1960s; on the service industry and employment; and trade figures. Oil has helped b alance the UK's trade and has supported hundreds of thousands of jobs. The UK wil l soon join the US, Germany and Japan as net energy importers. As a partial reflection of the UK's oil trade defic it, the UK's balance of payments showed a deficit of £10.2b for the three-months to November 2003, and was running at over £40b p.a. Harold Macmillan's Conservative gove rnment was thrown out of office in 1964 for having a balance of payments deficit of well under £1b, yet a deficit of £40b scarcely attracts any comment forty years later. Th e UK's oil has already begun to run out. As if blind to all this, Brown, the Labour Cha ncellor had thrown huge amounts of cash at the public services, and ministers were quo ted in the press as privately admitting that £70b had been wasted, money swallowed up by th e hospitals/schools black hole with no visible improvement to show for it. What all this means is that both the US and the UK were desperate for oil in 2001. If the US was to continue to lead Western civilizat ion for the Syndicate, it required additional long-term cheap sources of oil. If the U K was to continue to provide a supporting role, so did the UK. The Syndicate had a ccess to many other countries' oil but needed the US and the UK to maintain their oil supplies so that they could play their part in implementing a world government. In 2001 the US was the second largest oil producer (7.717m b/d) to Saudi Arabia (8.768m b/d). According to the US Department of Ene rgy own projections, the US and its major trading partners (Canada, Venezuela and M exico) would have to become more dependent on Gulf oil over the next two decades. Bush Jr.'s administration has strong links with the oil industry. Many of the large energy-oil companies donated money to the Republica n Party. Given the statistics we have been looking at and the background of Bush Jr.'s administration, it could be expected that oil would be the hallmark of a Bush J r. administration. With its own oil running out and Saudi Arabia, hold er of the world's largest oil reserves, looking increasingly unstable, economic s elf-interest demanded that the US should control a significant source of Middle Easte rn/Caspian oil. It was in the UK's economic self-interest to provide support. The war with Iraq and the rehabilitation of Gaddafi 's Libya - which until 1969 had supplied a quarter of Europe's crude oil - should b e seen in this light.

He headed the new Rothschild bank in London, England, which was known as N. M. Rothschild and Sons. James Mayer Rothschild was in charge of the Rothsch ild bank in France, known as Messieurs de Rothschild Freres. The Rothschild bank in Germany was known as M. A.

Rothschild would withdraw from all its commodity trading activities, which accounted for 2.2% of \"Rothschilds\" operating income, includi ng the gold market and its chairing of the London meetings that have set the world gold price since 1919 and including an oil trading business set up very recently. The chan ge was due to restructuring by Baron David de Rothschild, who had taken control of the b ank from his cousin, Sir Evelyn de Rothschild. See report in Daily Telegraph, Business section, April 15, 2004. In June 2003 N. M. Rothschild had set up a new oil business with a new range of derivative products to attract customers from the oil and power generat ion industries. One of Baron David's first acts was to commission finance director Andre w Didham to conduct a strategic review of the business. He implemented Didham's fin dings that the commodities business did not fit in with the bank's private and investment banking business. Two- thirds of the world's gold is privately owned. It i s not known how much of this is owned by \"Rothschilds.\" See Daily Telegraph, Business sec tion, April 17, 2004. 15.

Morton, op. cit., P57, quoted by Markus Angelicus i n Gold Digest see: www.gwb.com. au/gwb/news/banking/rothschild.html. I have checked the dollar-pound exchange rate from 1800 to 1900 from a table provided by Miami Un iversity: http.//eh.net/hmit/ exchangerates/exchange.answer.php. It is around $5 to the £1 (£0.20/21/22 for most of the 19th century, with £0.10-0.18 from 1862 to 1 876). Morton's low $6b is, he says, equivalent to \"400 million pounds.\" On the above ex change rate $6b was equivalent to £1.2b. If the figure were £400m, each of the figure s in the 4%-8% range should be cut by two-thirds. However, £1.2b is a more realistic b ase for the Rothschilds' wealth after Waterloo, and is much lower than other estimates. M orton's book was commissioned by the Rothschild family, who are known to play down t heir wealth and to hide behind their legend. (Morton writes, p. 11: \"Today the family gr ooms the inaudibility and invisibility of its presence. As a result, some believe that lit tle is left apart from a great legend. And"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"Notes I Sources 341 the Rothschilds are quite content to let the legend be their public relations.\") So when Morton tells us that the Rothschilds' wealth was $6 b for much of the nineteenth century, i.e. after Waterloo/c.1820, we may feel that the fa mily is his source and we should be aware that there may be understatement. See also \"The History of Money\": http://www.xat.org /xat/hist0ry2.html, \"The 19th century became known as the age of the Rothschilds when it was estimated they controlled half of the world's wealth ... They only apply the Rothschild name to a small fraction of the companies they actually control. So me authors claim that the Rothschilds had not only taken over the Bank of England but the y had also in 1816 backed a new privately owned Central Bank in America called The Second Bank of the United States.\" Around 1900 the Rothschilds' wealth was held to be greater than that of all the crown heads of Europe put together.

In June 2003 Congress raised the \"debt-ceiling\" to $7,414 trillion. See text for ch 14, note 12. At its present rate of increase it was expected to reach $7.5 trillion by the end of 2004. The interest payments on the US federal national de bt were estimated at over $409b during the federal fiscal year from October 2003 to September 2004. As the Syndicate is responsible for the Federal Reserve System, in o ne form or another Syndicate banks receive this interest. It can be said that the Synd icate now receives some $400b a year from the Federal Reserve System. See next section. See: http://www.uwsa.com/uwsa- usdebt.html 22. The Secret History of the West shows that all the r evolutions from 1453 to the Russian revolution lead to the New World Order. The Rothsch ild story is traced in relation to Mayer's collaboration with Adam Weishaupt, the Roth schilds' contribution to the development of the British Empire and their role in the first Russian revolution.

Rivera, Final Warning, A History of the New World Order, p. 41. The Nation al Bank Act prohibited states' creation of money. Federal banks were now in control.

Most of these \"Baby Standards\" kept using the popul ar \"Red Crown\" and \"White Crown\" gasoline brands, as well as \"Polarine\" Motor Oil. W hen the \"Ethyl\" additive became popular, most Standards adopted it. \"Mobiloil\" was commonly used by many Standards. The former Standards banded together in 1930 to for m the Atlas Corporation, maker of tires, batteries, and other automotive accessories that were provided to Standard Stations of all stripes from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Standard Oil Company of New York (a.k.a. Socony) wa s awarded Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Co nnecticut, and New York.

With the completion of the Mid west Oil purchase in 1928, Utah Oil Refining's Vico-Pep 88 stations in Utah and Ida ho came under the Indiana Standard umbrella. Standard Oil Company of Louisiana (Stanocola) was a warded eastern Louisiana (New Orleans and vicinity) and Tennessee - This company was completely under the control of Jersey Standard before the 1911 breakup.

After much confusion, in 1931 Indiana Standard sued Colorado S tandard over the use of the Standard Oil name and won. In 1934, the suit was upheld and Colorado Standard was relegated to the footnotes of history. Standard Oil of Connecticut was chartered as Standa rd Coal and Charcoal Company in Stratford, CT in 1915. The company's local focus and lack of an oil connection at the time left it beneath the radar of Socony. The compa ny survived the Great Depression and became Standard Fuel after WW II. After the gre at re-branding of Esso as Exxon in the US, the local copyright to Standard Oil beca me available. Standard Fuel took the opportunity and became Standard Oil.

His goal was to capture the post-war Russian market. The two men visited British Prime Minister Lloyd Ge orge in London in late 1917. Thompson cabled requesting $1m from Morgan in New Y ork on December 2, 1917, and he invested $1m of his own money to convince Russia n peasants to support Kerensky.

Crucial to th is entry was a spy ring operating in Tokyo and monitoring the Japanese intention to attack Pea rl Harbor. The ring's purpose was to encourage the Japanese to attack the US instead of \"Rockefellers\" Soviet partners. After Roosevelt's embargo on all shipping to Japan - in r etaliation for Japan's invasion of the French Indo-China - cut off Japan's oil supply and shut down its economy, the Japanese were told in effect, \"Destroy the US Fleet at Pearl Harbor, and you have won the war from the start.\" 67. Oliver Lyttelton, Minister of Production in Churchi ll's war cabinet, told Parliament on July 20, 1944: \"Japan was provoked into attacking A merica at Pearl Harbor. It is a travesty on history to say that America was forced into the war.\" Henry Stimson, Roosevelt's Secretary of War, later said that \"the question was how we should maneuver them (the Japanese) into the position of firing the first sho t without allowing too much danger to ourselves.\" At 6.45 a.m., 62 minutes before the Japanese attack on December 7, 1941, the American destroyer USS Ward fired at, and sank (wit h depth charges), a Japanese midget submarine whose periscope had earlier been o bserved above the water (by the minesweeper Condor) at 3.42 a.m. According to A ttack at Pearl Harbour 1941: The Japanese View Eyewitness (www.eyewitnesstohistory.c om), at 6.10 a.m. a first wave of 183"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"370 The Syndicate planes took off from Japanese aircraft carriers 230 miles north of Pearl Harbor.

They could not forget the role play ed by the 'Rockefeller'-Standard Oil crowd in the cancellation of the concessions. They avenged themselves ... by destroying 'Rockefeller'-Standard Oil property first ... To ac complish the destruction of Japan, it was necessary to bring the American Army to the res cue of their property in China. But it would have been futile for the 'Rockefeller'-Sta ndard Oil interests to ask Congress to declare war on Japan because it was destroying thei r property in China ... If, however, Japan could be induced to attack US - that would be a different story... The appointment of Joseph Grew, nephew of John Pierpont Morgan, as Ambassador to Japan was dictated.

This brought into being the European Economic Community (EEC) of 1958 and inspired another grouping of nations outside the EEC, the European Free Trade Association, which came into operation in 1960.

There is a single-source claim, not sufficiently su bstantiated to my satisfaction, that the most controversial and disputed of these organi zations, known as the Committee of 300, controls all the groups. Dr John Coleman is an ex-intelligence officer with MI6 who encountered all the hidden organizations during his career. He wrote Conspirators' Hierarchy: The Story of the Committee of 300 in 199 2. He and George Armstrong, an authority on the Rothschilds (in The Rothschild Mon ey Trust - p25), hold that on Mayer Amschel Rothschild's death his descendants were fac ed with the task of managing the greatest estate the world has ever known, and t hat by the 1890s this had grown to enormous proportions. Armstrong believes that Th omas Herzl, the founder of the Zionist movement to establish a Jewish homeland and intimate friend of Lord Rothschild, was in the Rothschilds' employ, and tha t he was asked to draw up a plan to cope with the administration of such vast power. Herzl helped to establish a Secret Committee of 300 to manage the huge estate. (Armstr ong believes the 300 double up as the 300 Elders mentioned in The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, which may have been written by Herzl.) The authoritative Quigley worryingly does not menti on the Committee of 300. According to Coleman, the Committee of 300 is the p ower that established the Round Table through MI6 (Coleman, op. cit., p. 152); cont rols the Bilderberg Group (Coleman, op. cit., p. 207), which is directed by the RIIA; a nd controls and manages the British and US governments through the RIIA and the CFR. He cla ims that the Club of Rome is an additional foreign policy arm of the Round Table/Co mmittee of 300 (Coleman, op. cit., p. 101), and that besides presenting reports to the British government, MI6 is also the Committee of 300's secret intelligence arm. According to Coleman, the structure of the Committe e of 300 may have evolved from the British East India Company, a British comm ercial and political organization incorporated in 1600 that worked as an agent of Bri tish imperialism in India as it traded in East-Indian spices, cotton, silks and eventually opium. The Committee goes back to the 1830s or 1840s, but did not take its present fo rm until 1897, the year Milner (then High Commissioner of South Africa) began to build u p his body of assistants (\"Milner's Kindergarten\"), as described in detail by Quigley i n The Anglo-American Establishment. According to Coleman, on the death of Queen Victori a the royal families of Europe - the families of the monarchs of Britain, the Neth erlands and Denmark and the noble, aristocratic families of Italy - decided to go into business with leaders of corporate enterprise, \"commoners,\" to gain world-wide control and rule the world. The 300 are the members of this 'firm' that seeks to control wo rld events through the influence of the likes of the Rothschilds. Coleman claims tha t the Knights of the Garter are the inner circle of this Committee - the ceiling of the Throne Room in Buckingham Palace is covered in Garter stars. Coleman holds that the Rothschild estates are managed to neutralize Britain's loss of her American Empire. T o make up for, or even reverse, the"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"Notes I Sources 373 loss of the American Empire was one of the Round Ta ble's aims. Coleman claims that the Bilderberg Group is the foreign policy arm of t he Committee of 300, and that the Council on Foreign Relations has a secret Anglophil e agenda; that Britain is at the forefront of its decisions and policy-making. Is Coleman a credible witness? Or is the Committee of 300 just another name for the Round Table, or perhaps Rhodes's original secret so ciety out of which the Round Table grew? Rivera says that the Round Table is sometimes called the \"Committee of 300\" and \"Olympians\"; and Daniel makes no mention of the Committee - he only refers to the Round Table. One of Coleman's claims is very hard to believe. He says that the Committee of 300 is headed by the Queen; and that i t runs the US as if the War of Independence had not happened. Bush Jr.'s decisions to go to war in Afghanistan and Iraq were surely taken with the US's considerations in mind, not on London's direction. If we are sceptical of this claim, we should also b e wary of going with Coleman's inside knowledge and seeing the Committee of 300 as the mo st powerful of all the organizations we have been considering.

To Freemasons, the plan is to re- establish a one-world government that (Freemasons claim) was partly destroyed with A tlantis and finally destroyed by God at Babylon. The plan is to rebuild a new Atlantis b ased on the New World, the USA. The constitution of the USA parallels that of the Mason ic federal system of government. By spreading the federal constitution of the USA throu ghout the world, Freemasonry will be spreading its own federal system of government. The plan has motivated numerous revolutions, including the French and Russian revol utions, as I have shown in The Secret History of the West.

Youn g's plan to provide the Allies with reparations to be paid by Germany for the Firs t World War. With Rockefeller banker Gates W McGarrah (formerly of Chase National Bank a nd the Federal Reserve Bank) as its first president, it soon turned into a channel for American and British funds to reach Hitler. By the outbreak of the Second World War the BIS was \"completely under Hitler's control\" (Charles Higham). Its directors included H ermann Schmitz, head of I. G.

The Encyclopaedia Britannica states the total death s in the Second World War as 35,813,000. However, more detailed research involvi ng Soviet records revealed after the collapse of the USSR in Barbarossa, The Axis an d the Allies, op. cit., shows that 49 million Soviet people died in Russia after Operatio n Barbarossa alone. According to this work, a conservative estimate of the total num ber of dead in the Second World War is between just under 36 million (including 18 mill ion Russians) to 67 million; and a higher estimate is between 60 and 90 million. The n umbers killed rose colossally after von Stauffenberg's plot, and if the known figures o f those killed to mid-1944 are put against the higher estimate, then 30 million is not an unreasonable figure for those killed on a higher estimate (which is merited by po st-Soviet research) during the final year. 84. The Syndicate's switch to Stalin first revealed its elf when Eisenhower, in conjunction with Gen. Marshall, rejected Field Marshal Montgome ry's plan made in late 1944 to take Berlin. Eisenhower and those above him used delayin g tactics to allow Stalin to reach Berlin before the Allies. Before that efforts were made, as part of the war effort, to ensure that the USSR was not defeated by Germany, and that invading Nazi troops were beaten back. There was nothing strange about this policy; Churchill's Britain also wanted its ally Stalin to survive. See next paragraph. Stalin was saved when, with Hitler and his army onl y 37 miles from Moscow on October 24,1941, the US entered the war in response to Japa n's attack on Pearl Harbor. In so far as the Syndicate was responsible for intriguing the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Syndicate was responsible for saving Stalin - and siding with Stalin against Hitler. Evidence for Roosevelt's pro-Russian policy surfaced in the spri ng of 1943, when a faction within the German secret service offered to assassinate Hi tler and surrender so long as Soviet troops ceased their advance. Roosevelt refused and postponed a planned US invasion of Europe. The effect of this decision was to give Sta lin more time to advance. See Rivera, op. cit., p. 112. 85. Roosevelt, whose Cabinet included many Rockefel ler nominees, appointed Eisenhower Supreme Commander in Europe on December 24, 1943. H e had no battle experience or experience of handling hundreds of thousands of troops in the field. He had been promoted above some 150 more experienced soldiers. In a speech when opening a part in New York, founded by Bernard Baruch in hono r of his father, Eisenhower said: \"Twenty-five years ago, as a young and unknown Majo r, I took the wisest step in my life - I consulted Mr Baruch.\" See A. K. Chesterton, The New Unhappy Lords, p. 36. Baruch was advisor to several presidents and influenced Ro osevelt throughout his political life. Eisenhower and Marshall were both acting in CFR and Rockefellerite interests. Roosevelt was a Rockefeller puppet in so far as he owed his p residency to the intriguing of Col. House who made sure he followed a Rockefellerite ag enda. House masterminded the election of Roosevelt - and then vanished from the political scene.

The Rockefeller involvement can be gauged from David Rockefeller's involvement as secretary. It was originally to have been called the Truman Plan; it was named the Marshall Plan because Gen.

Churchill may have agreed to de-colonize in return for US involvement in the Second World War after Dunkirk (see notes 50-52 in ch 5). The Attlee government may have been honoring this secret promise. Whether or not t he decision to de-colonize was taken in 1940-41, de-colonization was inevitable af ter Suez in 1956. De-colonization had long been an aim of the Round Table, where self -government was being advanced for India as early as 1909 and Curtis proposed chan ging the name \"British Empire\" to \"Commonwealth of Nations\" in a book published in 1916. See Quigley, Tragedy and Hope, op. cit., pp144, 164-5. The Rothschilds, firs t funders of the Round Table, may have initiated the decision to speed up de-colonization in early 1957 and have inspired the Earl of Gosford's statement. They certainly went al ong with it. Ferguson (op. cit., pp. 816-7) points out that the Rothschilds backed Briti sh Empire-building when it could be achieved without precipitating conflict with oth er European powers, and preferred \"multi-national imperialism\" if conflict threatened . 1957 was a time when they could be expect to prefer \"multi-national imperialism,\" i.e. in Europe's case, a United States of Europe. For Macmillan as a member of the RIIA, see Mullins, op. cit., p. 51. The 1934 list of members of RIIA included Macmillan's name. He was a n MP from 1924 to 1929 and from 1931 to 1964. Whatever help he gave the RIIA w as on top of his work as an MP. Macmillan's \"winds of change\" speech (as it became known) was delivered twice, first in Accra, then in Cape Town a few weeks later. The wording suggests an intention to de- colonize rather than a lament at hostility towards the colonies: \"Ever since the break-up of the Roman Empire, one of the constant factors of political life has been the emergence of the independent nations. The wind of change is b lowing through this continent and whether we like it or not this growth of national c onsciousness is a political fact.

This he followed up by delivering Cuba to the Soviets as a missile base , while belatedly pretending to block its takeover.\" In 1956 the Rockefeller Brothers Fund had commissio ned a project to consider America's military preparedness and foreign policy. Under first Nelson and then Laurance Rockefeller, the panel produced six report s, the most important of which was International Security: The Military Aspect, which was prepared under the direction of Henry Kissinger (then Associated Director of the Ce nter for International Affairs). After the Russians successfully tested the first intercon tinental ballistic missile (ICBM) the Rockefellers (in conjunction with a certain Gatler) produced reports urging an expansion of missile programs, and an increase in deterrents in conventional forces. \"Rockefellers\" wrote the blueprint for an acceleration in the arms race that would increase America's debt to the Syndicate's banks. The reports were imp lemented when J. F. Kennedy took office in January 1961. 51. Josephson, The \"Federal\" Reserve Conspiracy and Roc kefeller, op. cit., p. 238, is critical of Kennedy. Kennedy, he says, sent GIs into a \"trap \" in Vietnam, where they were surrounded by the Communist population. The French had been driven from Indo- China in order to gain control of the oilfields in the China coastal shelf. But Pope Paul VI had urged the withdrawal of US troops. Josephson remarks, \"It is incredible that any one of the faith would favor the slaughter of the C atholic refugees in Vietnam that would certainly follow the withdrawal of (US) troops ther e, as demanded by Pope Paul.\" As a Catholic, he was bound to listen to the Pope's view . Kennedy was known to have wanted to withdraw US troops from Vietnam by 1965. And the Syndicate may have thought him unreliable.

Marshall, the Syndicate had supported the replacement of Chiang by Mao in China. US/Syndicate policy at Yalta and Potsdam in 1945 was summarized by Owen Lattimore: \"The problem was how to allow them (Chin a) to fall without making it look as if the United States had pushed them.\" \"Rockefel lers\" had backed Mao, and the Sino- Soviet Pact cemented their work on pipelining out S oviet and Chinese oil. When the feud between Krushchev and Mao caused trade between the USSR and China to break down, \"Rockefellers\" interests were damaged. \"David Rockefeller's personally opened Hong Kong branch of his Chase Manhattan Bank got no business or profits from that trade. The press openly discussed the advantage for restoring that trade, of deposing both Krushchev and Mao Tse Tung, the two stumbling block s.\" Josephson, The \"Federal\" Reserve Conspiracy and Rockefeller, op. cit., p. 292. To re store profits to the Hong Kong branch of his bank, David Rockefeller expected both Krushchev and Mao to restore their trade. 61. Josephson, The \"Federal\" Reserve Conspiracy and Roc kefeller, op. cit., p. 292. 62. Until the 1930s, Rockefellers supplied kerosene for Chinese lamps and through the ruling Soong family made sure that no competitors d rilled for oil in any part of China. They therefore had an effective monopoly rather tha n a monopoly by right of the kind Elizabeth I granted Sir Walter Raleigh on all expor ts from the New World in the 1590s. In 1931 Japan invaded China's north-eastern Manchur ian provinces to control their oil. \"Rockefellers\" wanted the Second World War so that Japan's challenge to China could be destroyed. Since 1945 \"Rockefellers\" have been the key player in the extraction of China's oil, but have no longer enjoyed an effective monopo ly. See note 32 to ch 4. See Josephson, Rockefeller \"Internationalist\", op. cit., pp. 381-2 . By the 1920s, the Socony-Vacuum- Standard Oil subsidiaries had a virtual monopoly of the market for oil/kerosene for the lamps of China. The companies managed it so that ve ry little oil was produced in China. They were in collaboration with the Soong family an d the Nationalist government. 63. For the background to this, see Josephson, Rockefel ler \"Internationalist\", op. cit., pp. 382-6: \"The (Japanese) proceeded to seize China ... They c ould not forget the role played by the 'Rockefeller'-Standard Oil crowd in the cancellatio n of the concessions. They avenged"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"Notes I Sources 393 themselves ... by destroying 'Rockefeller'-Standard Oil property first ... To accomplish the destruction of Japan, it was necessary to bring the American Army to the rescue of their property in China. But it would have been futile for the 'Rockefeller'-Standard Oil interests to ask Congress to declare war on Jap an because it was destroying their property in China... If, however, Japan could be in duced to attack the US - that would be a different story ... The appointment of Joseph Gre w, nephew of John Pierpont Morgan, as Ambassador to Japan was dictated. The plan was t o induce the Japs to attack the United States ... The conspirators were impatiently waiting and working to bring about an attack on the United States that would force Con gress to declare officially the war that Roosevelt already was waging unofficially ... Rocke feller's Institute of Pacific Relations agents working under Sorge precipitated the Japanes e attack on Pearl Harbor that the conspirators sought in order to bring the US into t he war... As early as October 1941 the conspirators knew that the Japanese definitely plan ned an attack on Pearl Harbor.\" The principal \"Rockefellerite\" in Truman's war cabi net was the Secretary of the Department of War, Henry Stimson. The Stimson Cente r was later funded by the Rockefeller Foundation - see http://www.stimson.org /?SN=AB2001120454. When Stimson, a member of the CFR, went to Washington in 1940 as Secretary of War he took with him John McCloy as Assistant Secretary of War of the CFR. Before 1940 McCloy had been a member of the law firm Cravath, Gersdorf f, Swaine and Wood, which had represented I. G. Farben and its affiliates, Rockef ellerite enterprises. He became High Commissioner in post-war Germany. 64. The development of the atomic bomb took place a t the Rockefeller-owned University of Chicago. Enrico Fermi was awarded a Rockefeller Fel lowship to help develop the atomic bomb. See http://www.reformation.org/pharaoh-rockef eller.htrnl under the heading \"Rockefeller financed the atomic bomb.\" Truman made the decision to use the atomic bomb against Japan between July 17 and 24, 1945. On July 17 Stimson flew to Potsdam and gave Truman full details of the successful atom ic test. Truman immediately called in Gen. Marshall, Byrnes, Leahy, Gen. Arnold and Admir al King to review military strategy in the light of the successful test. Stimson was th e focal point of the meeting. On July 24 The War Department, i.e. Stimson's department, w as \"given orders\" to instruct Gen. Spaatz that the first bomb would be dropped as soon after August 3 as weather permitted. The key figures in the decision to drop the first a tomic bomb were Stimson and Truman. Truman had not heard of the bomb when he took over the presidency on Roosevelt's death; Stimson told Truman about the new weapon on April 12,1945. For a timeline for the decision to use the atomic bomb, see Nuclearfil es.org, http://www.nuclearfiles.org/ redocuments/1957/570529-chronology.html. Also \"Atom ic Bomb: Decision,\" http:// www.dannen.com/decision/index.html. The Hungarian-b orn scientist Dr. Leo Szilard opposed the use of the bomb, felt that Truman and t hose immediately below him gave insufficient study to all the alternatives to using the atomic bomb: \"They thought only in terms of our having to end the war by military mean s.\" See \"President Truman Did Not Understand,\" http://www.peak.org/~danneng/decision/ usnews.html. Stimson was as much a Syndicate pawn as Marshall, both of whom man ipulated an inexperienced and pliant president. Stimson had already done war work for \"Rockefellers \"/the IPR. He had been behind the events that led up to Pearl Harbor. He wrote in his diary after meeting President Roosevelt: \"We face the delicate question of the di plomatic fencing to be done so as to be sure Japan is put into the wrong and make the first bad move - overt move.\" After a later"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"394 The Syndicate meeting he wrote: \"The question was how we should m aneuver them (the Japanese) into the position of firing the first shot.\" Quoted in Perloff, op. cit., pp. 66-7. 65.

Spotlight, July 17, 1995, p. 5: \"The Bilderberg Gro up was outraged when Major, who had been put in power because Margaret Thatcher had protected British sovereignty (Spotlight, May 29, 1989), tried to appease 'Euro-r ebels' by suggesting 'the time may never be right' for a common European currency ... Major, finding himself in political quicksand, quickly recanted and again supports the common currency. Despite being a tool of the Bilderbergers since taking office, his momentary slip brought outrage, and Bilderberg influence forced Major to resign as part y leader and stand for election. But the only challenger to emerge was John Redwood, a T hatcherite who bitterly opposes surrendering British sovereignty to the European Un ion, so the Bilderberg Group was forced to embrace its Prodigal Son again.\" Major as tonished ministers in his government by voting for the Maastricht Treaty. (One minister told me he was expecting Major to vote against.) The Syndicate evidently expected him to deliver progress towards a united Europe. His small majority impeded this, and he was replaced by Blair following a general election. 11. The British Prime Minister is always a \"Rothschildi te.\" Sir Evelyn de Rothschild agreed to fund Blair's campaign for the 2005 general elect ion. See the last section of ch 14. 12. These constitutional changes were to create regions in the coming United States of Europe. 13. The plan to split England into 8 European regio ns was formulated under Major's premiership. Some 170 local government officers fro m Eastern region were summoned to a secret conference, a report on which was leake d to me in 1998. See Prescott's regional commission in 1996, in the next paragraph. All the regions in the coming United States of Europe are to have tax-raising powers. A White P aper published on May 9, 2002 envisaged that regional assemblies would receive mo st of their money directly from Whitehall, but that they would be able to raise ext ra cash to cover estimated running costs of £25m a year by levying a precept on counci l tax. See: http://www.telegraph. co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/05/10/nregro.x ml. This arrangement is a kind of \"half-way house\". When fully fledged, regio nal assemblies are to have tax-raising powers. See Lord Stoddart of Swindon, House of Lord s on March 20, 2003: \"If they are not to have tax-raising powers, they would be infer ior to Scotland ... The fact that they would consider themselves to be inferior, as Wales is now doing, would mean that they would press for tax-raising powers. If they are to be significant regional entities, they"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"398 The Syndicate probably need tax-raising powers.\" See: http://www. parliament.the-stationery-office. co.uk/pa/1d199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds03/text/30320-10 .htm. 14.

Heath was told that British fishing interests would have to be sacrificed if Britain was to join the Common Market. He agreed to this. See: htt p://www.bobdoust.co.uk/curouk. htm. 18. Alistair McConnachie, Sovereignty, January 2003, ht tp://www.sovereignty.org.uk/ features/articles/fishing6.html, holds that the \"co nservation crisis\" argument is a convenient excuse for the severe cutbacks on the Br itish - predominantly Scottish - fleet, which make increasing room for Spain and oth ers. The French have been allowed to fish for 25 days per month, whereas Scottish whi tefish trawlers will only be allowed to fish for up to 15 days a month, with quotas cut by 45%. For the Brussels plan to assist the \"poorer\" nations of Ireland and Spain to construct boats which will be able to catch more fish, confining North Sea British boats to nine day s' fishing per month instead of the previous 15, see: http://www.bfors.com/mediacentre/ dossiers/display.asp?IDNO=943. 19.

With the closure of the Selby pit complex later in 2004 there would be only nine working pits left in the UK. There were 180,000 miners in 1984; in early 200 4 there were 6,000 in 12 working pits. There is a case for seeing the miners' strike, whic h was linked with the Communist Party of Great Britain and the USSR, as a Soviet-ba sed \"Rockefellerite\" attempt to intrigue a revolution in Britain through the use of flying pickets in order to seize and control North-Sea oil. 21. Decommissioning commenced on the following dates fo r these nuclear power stations in the UK: Windscale (1981); Berkeley (1988-89); Hu nterston A and Winfrith (1990); Trawsfyndd (1993); Dounreay (1994); Hinkley Point A (2000); and Bradwell (2002).

There was considerable speculation in the informed press that Blair would move from being Prime Minister of the UK to President of Euro pe. 27. Widely reported in the British press. For example t he Daily Telegraph, Thursday October 16, 2003, front-page headlined story: \"The Queen is growing more concerned about Tony Blair's plans to sign a European constitution that she fears could undermine her role as sovereign. The Daily Telegraph has learnt t hat Buckingham Palance has asked for documents highlighting the constitutional implicati ons of the EU's plans to be sent to her advisors ... It is believed that the Palace's c oncerns focus on whether the Queen's supreme authority as the guardian of the British co nstitution, asserted through the sovereignty of Parliament, could be altered or unde rmined by article 10 of the draft text.\" Article 10 states: \"The constitution and law adopted by the union's institutions in exercising competences conferred on it shall have p rimacy over the law of the member states.\" The caption under a photo of the Queen sta ted: \"Sources say she has sought independent advice on the EU plans.\" The Queen was said to be unhappy with plans to get rid of the Lord Chancellor's role as part of constitutional reform (see two paras below). See http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/ 3499702.stm. 28. Buckingham Palace stated, \"We will be consulted in due course.\" For the removal of \"Crown\" from the Crown Prosecution Service, see BBC News, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/ hi/uk_politics/3529125.stm. Blair denied the change was a snub to the Queen. However Her Majesty's Prison Service was also renamed the N ational Offender Management Service, and Conservatives claimed Labour had a rep ublican agenda. See Portman Papers, October 2002, p. 12. A constitu tional expert David Bourne argues that the UK of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, the basis of the Throne of the Queen, is not the same as the UK within the EU in which England (nine regions), Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales (one region ea ch) make up 12 regions. Within the EU England is not a state, region, or administrativ e unit of the EU and therefore has no status or existence within the EU. Therefore the Th rone of Great Britain and Northern Ireland does not exist. On this argument the Queen became an ordinary European citizen when the Maastricht Treaty was signed. The root cause of this situation was the signing of the Treaty of Rome and the passing of th e European Communities Act 1972, which, according to Judge Morgan surrendered Britis h sovereignty to the EU. It was asserted in Portman Papers, October 2001, \"Since Jo hn Major established offices to vet the Queen's mail... she does not get to know anythi ng the politicians do not want her to"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"400 The Syndicate know.\" And: \"Unless the Queen can be made to retrac t the Treaty of Accession (signed around January 17, 1972), which she will not do, th en England is no more.\" 29. On April 9, 2001 in Sunderland, district Judge Bruc e Morgan found Steve Thoburn, a market greengrocer, guilty of selling bananas by the pound. He said Britain now operated under a \"new legal order.\" The 1972 Europe an Communities Act intentionally surrendered parliament's sovereignty to the primacy of European law and the European courts. \"Every national court must now set aside an y national law which conflicts with Community law.\" He said that all the commentat ors on the British legal system represent \"yesteryear\" and now only describe a \"non e-binding historical perspective.\" See http://users.aol.com/footrule/bananas.htm.

See http://www.consortiumnews.com/a rchive/xfile4.html. 18. See note 17. 19. See note 15. 20. See note 15, 21. The Shah was later of the view (in several intervie ws) that President Carter wanted his removal. Carter was \"Rockefellers\" nominee, and so it is likely that reports of the 1979 Bilderberg Group's meeting endorsing Khomeini are correct. \"Rockefellers\" and Kissinger believed the Shah was badly treated, bein g drummed from pillar to post by Carter when ill, but they were still responsible fo r contributing to the change, which they no doubt soon regretted. See http://www.consortiumn ews.com/archive/xfile4.html. 22. The transfer was made electronically to the Bank of England under Executive Order no. 12277 signed by Jimmy Carter, on January 23, 1981. The Bank of England then made the transfer to Iran. 23. The planned pipeline seems to have been through Afg hanistan and Pakistan to the coast, whence the oil could be shipped. This would have replaced the flow of Russian oil through Iran, which Khomeini had stopped. See notes 15 and 16. 24. See note 15. 25.

At the Shah's request, Saddam had forced Khomeini t o leave Najaf, where he was subverting the Shah's regime in 1978. In power, Kho meini targeted the Shi'ites in Iraq. Eying Iranian and Iraqi oil, the Syndicate-backed U S and British governments sided with Saddam against Iran's clerical extremism. All throu gh the summer of 1980, newspapers carried reports that Iraq was planning an attack on Iran \"to teach Khomeini a lesson.\" According to Anthony Parsons (then UK Permanent Rep resentative to the UN), in Cold War to Hot Peace, p45, no one at the UN tried to pr event war between Iraq and Iran. Khomeini had taken hostage the staff of the America n Embassy in Tehran, and there was no sympathy with Iran - rather, covert encourag ement of Iraq, including Western supply of arms to Saddam. After Saddam abrogated th e 1975 agreement with Iran, the Security Council did not meet for some days. A seni or Iraqi official spoke of a blitzkrieg that would last only a few days.

For example b y William Lowther in Washington, Daily Mail, May 18, 2002, headlined \"US had plan to topple bin Laden before Sept 11.\" The plan to remove bin Laden, dated September 10, 2001, was drawn up by White House foreign policy advisors after weeks of warnin gs of an imminent terrorist attack. It was \"placed on Condoleezza Rice's desk for Bush to review.\" Lowther wrote: \"The White House said it recommended thwarting bin Laden 'thro ugh work with the Northern Alliance to dismantle al-Qaeda and the Taliban.' Th e memo outlined a £140m CIA programme to arm the Northern Alliance and other an ti-Taliban forces.\" Also see section headed CIA? How much did the CIA k now in advance? below. On April 8, 2004, Condoleezza Rice, when questioned by the c ongressional hearing, held that Bush Jr. did take al-Qaeda seriously and that altho ugh there was a warning on 6 August that al-Qaeda wanted to attack America it was not s pecific and no one appreciated the scale of the coming attack in the absence of specif ic information. The Presidential Daily Briefing of August 6, 2001 reported \"patterns of su spicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or othe r types of attacks, including recent surveillance of federal buildings in New York'. Its publication marked the first time in US history that a sitting president published one o f his daily intelligence briefings. The plan on her desk on September 10 may have been a re sponse to the warning of August 6. Rice denied having seen any reports about al-Qae da using a plane as a weapon until after September 11. See: http://www.guardian.co.uk/ uslatest/story/0%2C1282%2c- 3963357%2C00.html. According to the American Free Press of November 11 , 2002, p. 14, the US government said it was a \"bizarre coincidence\" that a US intel ligence agency had planned a mock plane-into-building crash on September 11 - that a training 'exercise' was overlaid with a lethal scheme. In the same way Yitzhak Rabin, the former Israeli prime minister, was assassinated during a security exercise. The target of the US exercise was the National Reconnaissance Office building, which was set to co nduct an emergency drill in which a simulated plane from Dulles International Airport four miles away crashed into it. A plane heading towards a tall building might have be en thought to be taking part in the exercise. It was very convenient for those involved in the planning of the September-11 attacks that this exercise was scheduled on the sam e day. 4.

Roger Cohen, \"World Trade Center - History Commenta ry\": http://www.greatbuildings. com/buildings/World_Trade_Center_History.html. The New York Legislature created a World Trade Corporation in 1946 to explore the po ssibilities for a Trade Center in Manhattan. The idea was shelved when the Corporatio n focused on the New York waterfront. David Rockefeller revived the idea. Fro m his 60-story headquarters of the Chase Manhattan Bank, he proposed the formation of the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association, which retained an architectural partne rship to make drawings. Rockefeller sent a DLMA report to Mayor Wagner and his own brot her Nelson, New York's Governor; also to New Jersey Governor Robert Meyner . The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey took up David Rockefeller's suggesti on that they should be involved. David Rockefeller insisted that the Trade Center sh ould be in Lower Manhattan and be built by the Port Authority, and when eventually the Port Authority sought a major tenant Governor Rockefeller announced a consolidati on of state offices in 1.9m square feet of space in the Trade Center. David and Nelson Rockefeller were crucial to the building of the World Trade Center. The Port Author ity could not have built the Twin Towers without the two brothers, after whom they we re jokingly nicknamed. Hence the informal dedication of the Twin Towers to them.

Hutchison Whampoa, under Article 2.8, is allowed to transfer contract rights to any third party registered in Panama and can extend its leases until 2047.

Over the years there appears to have been a shift to \"Rockefellers.\" Acc ording to Standard and Poor, 53% of the shares in the Federal Reserve System are owned by the Rockefeller banking group; 8% are held by the Bank of Japan; and nine other sh areholders own some 4% each: the Rothschild Bank, London; the Rothschild Bank, Berli n, Lazard Brothers Banks of Paris; Israel Moses Seif Banks of Italy; the Warburg Bank of Hamburg; the Warburg Bank of Amsterdam; Lehman Brothers Banks of New York; Kuhn, Loeb Bank of New York; and Goldman Sachs Bank of New York. On this view Rothsc hilds own no more than 10% of the Federal Reserve System shares. To sum up, Ameri cans own 66%, Europeans 26% and Japanese 8%. See note 9. The above list was adopted in 1991 by Gary Kah (in his book En Route to Global Occupation). However, the Federal Reserve Act of 19 13 requires that all nationally chartered banks should buy stock in their regional Federal Reserve Bank, thereby becoming \"member banks.\" Member stock can only be h eld by banks and is related to size, the largest banks holding the largest stock. The law does not permit non-Americans and non-bank firms to own shares in any Federal Res erve Bank. The New York Federal Reserve Bank itself reported that on June 30, 1997 the top eight stockholders were the following US-owned, nationally or state-charter ed banks: Chase Manhattan Bank; Citibank; Morgan Guaranty Trust Company; Fleet Bank ; Bankers Trust; Bank of New York; Marine Midland Bank; Summit Bank. If the same principle governs the Federal Reserve System, then there could not be European an d Japanese ownership. See Dr. Edward Flaherty, \"Do Foreigners Own the Federal Res erve?\": http://www.alphalink. com.au/~noelmcd/lostlink/own.htm for all the facts in this paragraph. It has been claimed by (Kah and Thomas D. Schauf) t hat huge profits from the Federal Reserve System and Federal Reserve Bank of New York have been diverted to non-Americans through dividends paid to stockholder s, that non-Americans may own American banks. Kah holds that Rockefellers and the ir allies direct America's fiscal and monetary policies through the Treasury Department a nd the Federal Reserve System, making US economic policies synonymous with their o wn. The truth is, the Syndicate is fully in charge of b oth the above lists of owners. Chase Manhattan and Morgans are names that keep cropping up in relation to the Syndicate. The Federal Reserve System is a privately operated system, with a net profit in 1995 of $23.9b. Of this, 97.9% was paid to the Treasury; th e Federal Reserve Banks kept $283m, and paid $231m to the Federal Reserve System's stoc kholders as dividends.

Oil was an issue in Mexico in 1912, when civil war broke out, as a result of which Gen. Obregon gained control of Mexico City and installed Venustiano Carranza as President . (\"Rockefellers\" Standard Oil had run guns and money to Carranza, and had given him $ 100,000 in cash and fuel credits.) He produced a constitution that maintained that oil was a resource of the Mexican people, which came as a shock to Standard Oil and L ord Cowdray's companies. A tax was imposed on American companies trading in Mexica n oil. Cowdray sold his shares to Royal Dutch Shell, and following fighting Carranza was killed and replaced as President by Gen. Obregon, who, though supported by the US, t axed all oil exports 60%. Obregon was assassinated in 1928. The Mexican government th en cancelled the 1918 decrees that declared Mexican oil a resource of the Mexican peop le, and by 1936 17 foreign companies were pumping Mexican oil. In 1936 Pres. Cardenas na tionalized the subsoil rights of Standard Oil and other American and British compani es, including Royal Dutch, which now opposed Cardenas. They boycotted Mexican oil, a nd Cardenas sent oil to Germany, Italy and Spain. In 1947 there was a settlement, an d in 1970 a further settlement at the instigation of the CFR in which President Nixon and the Mexican President settled all past oil disputes. In fact America continues to exp ort Mexican oil. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) would allow oil to pas s from Mexico to the United States. 5.

Recently revealed Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) reports show that UN sanctions would put the Iraqi civilian population at risk. A report of January 1991 stated that the banning of chemicals and equipment would make drink ing water unsafe, resulting in epidemics. A second DIA report listed lack of wa ter, electrical and waste disposal systems, and distribution of preventative medicines , as likely causes of epidemics in urban areas. It predicted child diseases. The third report dated March 1991 noted an increase in gastrointestinal and respiratory diseas es in children and that drinkable water had been reduced to 5% of prewar supplies. See \"Gen ocide as Practical Policy\" in \"Slow Motion Holocaust\" by Stephanie Reich, Covert Action Quarterly, Spring 2002, http:// www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Iraq/SlowMotionHolocaust _Iraq.html, which argues that the US attack on Iraq's civilian population was \"de liberate and calculated.\" 17. In 1991 the UN made the American Cyrus Vance the UN Secretary-General's Personal Envoy to Yugoslavia and entrusted him with the task of bringing about a cease-fire and introducing a UN peacekeeping force into Croati a at the end of the fighting. The UN then appointed him and the British Lord Owen as \"Co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee,\" to be joint UN/EC negotiators. Vance an d Owen were unable to secure a peaceful settlement for a long while. It is interes ting that Vance, who was so identified with population control in 1980-I should be entrust ed with stopping the killing in former Yugoslavia in 1991-3. 18.

De La Ri ve in La Femme et l'Enfant dans la Franc-Magonnerie Universelle (p. 588), quoted in La dy Queenborough, Occult Theocrasy, pp. 220-1: \"To you Sovereign Grand Instructors Gene ral, we say this, that you may repeat it to the Brethren of the 32nd, 31st and 30th degre es: 'The Masonic religion should be, by all of us initiates of the high degrees, maintained in the purity of the Luciferian doctrine. If Lucifer were not God, would Adonay (The God of t he Christians)... calumniate him? Yes, Lucifer is God, and unfortunately Adonay is al so God. For the eternal law is that there is no light without shade, no beauty without ugliness, no white without black, for the absolute can only exist as two Gods: darkness b eing necessary for light to serve as its foil as the pedestal is necessary to the statue , and the brake to the locomotive ... The doctrine of Satanism is a heresy; and the true and pure philosophic religion is the belief in Lucifer, the equal of Adonay; but Lucifer, God o f Light and God of Good is struggling for humanity against Adonay, the God of Darkness an d Evil.'\" That message was to be given to all Freemasons of 3 0th degree and above in an initiative organized by Pike and Mazzini. Pike was then Sovereign Grand Commander of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemason ry; Mazzini was head of the Grand Orient Lodges. A \"super rite\" was created following Mazzini's letter to Pike of January"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"Notes I Sources 435 22, 1870, a kind of supreme council of all Freemaso ns who were to be entrusted with the supreme knowledge that Lucifer was the God of F reemasonry. Pike's Instructions can be found in many books published in the twentie th century, including Still, New World Order, op. cit., p. 31 (\"Though few Masons kn ow it, the god of Masonry is Lucifer\"); Griffin, Fourth Reich of the Rich, op. cit., p. 70; and Texe Marrs, Dark Majesty, op. cit., ch 12. Many books assert that the plan for the New World O rder is centered in Illuminated (i.e. Luciferian) Masonry, and have associated the New Wo rld Order leaders with the worship of Lucifer, for example Ralph Epperson, The New Wor ld Order, pp. 293-5 (\"George Bush [Sr.] is going to the Great Pyramid in the year 199 9 to bring in the millennium reign of Lucifer, a period called the New Age, or the New World Order\"); and Pat Robertson, The New World Order, p. 37 (\"a new order for the hu man race under the domination of Lucifer\").

The evidence suggests that th e September 11 attacks on the Twin Towers were bin Laden's work. The question is, did the Syndicate/CIA know in advance that they had been planned? The Twin Towers may hav e been designed (with David Rockefeller's input - see ch 10, note 6) with a Mas onic model in mind: the Twin Pillars of Atlantis built, according to Masons, by \"the chi ldren of Lamech,\" which were erected at the entrance to Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem - Boaz \"on the left\" and Jachin \"on the right\" (1 Kings, 7:21; 2 Chronicles, 3:17). See Icke, op. cit., p. 8. There can be no suggestion that the Syndicate ordered the attack s, but it is worth pointing out in passing that the Twin Towers, when set on fire, may have had a significance to occultists. Two smoking pillars constitute an altar, between wh ich (if you take up an appropriate position) stands the Masonic Statue of Liberty/Semi ramis with her torch. The torching of the two buildings could (to occultists), be cons trued as constituting a human sacrifice to Semiramis, bride of Lucifer, or perhaps to Lucif er himself as Moloch-Satan, to whom smoke went via the sky together with the energies o f sacrificial victims. Moloch, the god of the anti-Roman Carthaginians, was a god to whom humans were sacrificed. Moloch is the owl-god whose graven image stood in Bohemian Gr ove, near Santa Rosa, California, where Jon Ronson claims to have seen men reputed to be world leaders dressed in robes and hoods, burning effigies. See his extraord inary account in Them, p. 301. The Bohemian Club of California is reputed to be a cent er for the inner elite of Templar Scottish Rite Freemasonry, whose members include fo rmer Secretaries of State George Shultz and Henry Kissinger. It hosted a televised e xtravaganza on February 3, 1983 in honor of the Queen, who sat on high watching two da ncers who wore coned huge hats portraying Babylon (a ziggurat) and London (Big Ben ), and a voice bellowed, \"Oh Queen, you have traversed the ages from Babylon to London! \" See Daniel, op. cit., p. 663. All this is far too preposterous and far-fetched to include in the text - the implication is that the Syndicate torched the Twin Towers in an occult ritu al - but such things are being said and written, and mention needs to be made of them. 27. Icke, op. cit., p. 7. 28. After Noah's Flood Lucifer/Satan set up his headqua rters in Babylon - see Daniel, op. cit., p. 55. The York Manuscript states that Freema sonry originated at Babylon: \"At ye makeing of ye toure of Babell there was Masonrie fi rst much esteemed of, and the King of Babilon yt was called Nimrod was a Mason himself e and loved well Masons\" (Mackey's Encyclopedia, vol. ii, \"Nimrod\").

See Daniel, op. tit., p. 43. 29. The whore of Babylon, Semiramis, and the Tower of B abel built by her husband Nimrod, the first priest to Baal, to \"turn men from the fea r of God\" (Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, bk 1, 4:2,3) became symbols in a mystery reli gion that survived into Roman times, long after Babylon itself had been destroyed. Moder n occultists/Freemasons, relating to this mystery religion pilloried by St. John in Reve lation, have shown an interest in Iraq as it contains ruins that evoke the mystery religio n.
