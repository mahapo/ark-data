Introduction THE NAMELESS WAR Here is the story that people have said would nev er be written in our time — the true history of events leading up to the Second World War, told by one w ho enjoyed the friendship and confidence of Mr. Nev ille Chamberlain during the critical months between Mu nich and Sept ember, 1939. There has long been an unofficial ban on books dealing with w hat Captain Ramsay calls \"The Nameless War\", the conflict which h as been waged from behind the political scene for centu ries, which is still being waged and of which v ery few a re aware. The publishers of \"The Nameless War\" bel ieve this latest exposure w ill do more than any prev ious attempt t o break the con spiracy of si lence. The present work, with mu ch additional evidence and a fuller historical background, is the outcome of the personal experienc es of a public figure who in the course of duty has discovered at first-hand the ex istence of a centuries old conspiracy a gainst Britain, Europe, and t he whole o f Christendom . \"The Nameless War\" reveals an unsuspected link between all the majo r revolutions in Europe — from King Charles I's ti me to the abortive attempt aga inst Spain in 1936.

So grave did the situation for the Jews in Europe become, that an urgent appeal for help and advice was ad dressed by them to the Sanhedri n, then located at Constantinop le. This appeal was sent ove r the signature of Chemor, Rabbi of Arles in Provence, on the 13th January, 1489. The repl y came in Novembe r, 1489, which was issued ov er the signature of V .S.S. V.F.F. Pr ince of the Jew s. It advised the Jews of Europe to adopt the tactics o f the Trojan Horse; t o make their sons Christian priests, law yers, doctors, etc., and work to destroy the Christian st ructure from within. The first notable repercussion to this adv ice occurred in Spain in the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella. Many Jews were by then enrolled as Christians, but remaini ng secretly Jew s were wo rking to destr oy the Chr istian church i n Spain. So grave became the menace finally, that the Inquisition w as instituted in an endeavour to cleanse the country from these conspirators. Once again the Jew s were compelled to commence an ex odus from yet another country , whose hospitality they had abused. Trekking eastwards, these Jews join ed other Jewish communities in western Europe; considerable numbers flow ed on to Holl and and Swi tzerland. From now on these two countries were to become activ e centres of Jewish intrigue. Jewry, ho wever, ha s always n eeded a pow erful seafari ng nation to w hich to attach itself. Great Britain, newly un ited under James I, was a rising naval power, whi ch was already beginning to sw ay the four corners of the discov ered world. Here also there existed a wonderful fiel d for disruptive criticism; for alth ough it was a Christian kingdom, ye t it was one most sharply divided a s between Pr otestant and C atholic. A campaign for exploiting th is division and fanning hatre ds between the Christian communities was soon in process of or ganization.

Strafford, who had been in hi s early days inclined to follow the opposite faction, later left them; and became a stau nch and dev oted adheren t of the King. This opposition faction became steadily more hostile to Charles and by the time that they were led by Pym and decided to impe ach Strafford. \"The King,\" writes Di sraeli, \"regarded this faction as his enemies\"; and he states that the head of this faction wa s the Earl of Be dford. Walsh, the eminent Catholic historian, states that a Jew wine merchant named Roussel was the founder of this fam ily in Tudor times. With the imp eachment and execution o f Strafford, th e powers be hind the risi ng Calvin ist, or Cohen ist, Conspira cy began to rev eal themselv es, and their focus, the City of London.

To do so we must turn to such other works as the Jewish Encyclopedi a, Sombart's work, The Jews and Moder n Capitalism, and others. From the se we learn that Cromwell, the chief figure o f the revolution, was in close contact with the powerful Jew financiers in Holland; and w as in fact paid large sums of money by Manasseh Ben Israel; whilst Fernandez Carv ajal, \"The Great Jew\" as he w as called, was the chief contractor of th e New Mode l Army. In The Jews in England we read: \"1643 brought a large contingent of Jew s to England, their rallying point was the house of the Portuguese Ambassador De Souza, a Marano (secret Jew).

The five members wi th armed mobs and banners accompany ing them, were given a triumphal return to Westminster. The stage w as now set for the advent of Carvajal and his Jews and the rise of th eir creature Cromwell . The scene now changes. The Ci vil War has taken its course. The y ear is 1647: Naseby has been won an d lost. The King is virtuall y a prisoner, while tre ated as an honoured gue st at Holmby House. According to a letter published in Plain English ( a weekly review published by the North British Publishing Co. and edited by the late Lord Alfr ed Douglas.) on 3rd September, 1 921: \"The Learned Elders have b een in existence for a much lo nger period than they"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8 have perha ps suspected.

Just such an event took place, on 12th N ovember of that year. H ollis and Ludlow consider the f light as a stra tagem of Cro mwell's. Is aac Disraeli states: \"Contemporary historians hav e decided that the King from the day of his deportation from Holmby to his escape to the Isle of Wight was throughou t the dupe of Crom well.\" Little more remains to be said. C romwell had carried out the orders from the Synagogue , and now i t only rem ained to stage the mock trial . Maneuvering for position conti nued for some time. And it became apparent that the House of Commons, even in their partially \"purged\" condi tion, were in favour o f coming to an agreement with the Kin g. On 5th December, 1648, the House sat all night; and finally carried the question, \"T hat the King's concessions were satisfactory to a settlement.\" Should s uch agre ement have been reac hed, of c ourse, C romwell wou ld not have received the large sums of money which he was hoping to get from the Jews. He struck again. On the night of December 6 th, Colonel Pryde, on his i nstructions, carried out the last and most famous \"purge\" of the House of Commons, known as \"Pryde's Purge.\" On 4th January, the Communi st remnant of 50 members, the Rump , invested themselves with \"the sup reme authori ty.\" On 9th January \"a High Cou rt of Justice\" to try the King wa s proclaimed. Two-thirds of its members w ere Levele rs from the Ar my. Algern on Sidney warned Cro mwell: \"First, the King can be tried by no court.

In 1897 a further important clue to th ese mysterious happenings fell i nto Gentile hands in the shape of the Protocols of the Elde rs of Zion.

Scotland was Royalist befor e everything else; and she had proclaimed Charles II King . Cromwell 's armies ma rched round S cotland, aide d by their Geneva sy mpathizers, dispensing Judaic barbarity; but Sco tland still called Charles II King. H e moreover accepted the Presbyterian form of C hristianity for Scotland; and slow ly but steadily the feeling in En gland began to come round to the Scottish point of vi ew. Finally upon the death o f Cromwell, all Britain w elcomed the King's restoration to the throne of Eng land. In 1660 Charles II returned; but there was an important difference betw een the Kingdom he had fled from as a boy, and the one to whi ch he returned as King. The enemies of Kingship were entr enched within his kingdom now , and as soon as the stage should be set for renewing the propaganda against the papacy and so, dividing once more persons, all of whom considered themselves as part of C hrist's Church, the next attack w ould devel op. The next attack would aim at placing the control of the finances of both Kingdoms in the hands of th e Jews, who were now firmly en sconced with in. Charles evidently ha d no consciousness of the Jewish problem or plans, or the menace they held for his peo ples.

The real objective of the \"Gl orious Revolution\" was a chieved a few yea rs later in 1694, when the Royal consent w as given for the setting up of the \"Bank of England\" and the institution of the National Debt. This charter handed over to an anonymous committee the R oyal prerogative of m inting money; converted the basis o f wealth to gold ; and enabled the international m oney lenders to secure their loans on the tax es of the country, instead of the doub tful undertaking of some ruler or potenta te which was all the security they could previously obtain. From that time economic machinery was set in motion which ultimately reduced all wealth to the fictitious t erms of gold which the Jews control ; and drained away th e life blood o f the land, the real weal th which w as the birthri ght of the Bri tish peoples.

The danger w as that the members of the new jo int Parliament would sooner or later, in the spirit of their ancestors, challenge this state of affairs.

Such a phenomenon merits the closest attenti on; especially in view of the fact that it has been foll owed by i dentical outb reaks in many countries. The main di scovery th at such an ex amination w ill revea l is this fact: the revolution was not the work of Fre nchmen to improve Fran ce.

Under the Illuminati worked Grand Orient Freemasonry, and under that again the Blue, or National, Masonry had o perated until it was conve rted over-night into Grand O rient Masonry by Phillipe d'Orleans in 1773. Little did E galite suspect the satanic powers that he was invoking, w hen he took that action, and satanic they certainly were. The name Lucifer means \"Light Bearer\"; and Illuminati t hose who w ere lit by that light. By the time the Estates General m et at Versailles on 5th May, 17 89, the paralysis of the executi ve authori ty by the secret organi zations was co mplete. Paralysis b y control o f public opin ion and publ icity was well adv anced by the n also. This was the manner of it s accomplishme nt. By 1780 d'Orleans' entir e income of 800,000 livres, tha nks to his reckless gambling and extrav agance, was mortgaged to the moneyl enders. In 1781, in return for accommodation, he signed papers handing ov er his palace, estates, and house the Palais Royal , to his creditors, with powers to form there a centre of poli tics, printing , pamphletee ring, gambli ng, lectures, b rothels, wi ne-shops, theatres, art galleries, athletics, and any other uses, which subsequently took the form of every variety of public deb auchery. In fact, Egalite's financial masters used his n ame and property to install a colossal organism for publicity and cor ruption, which appealed to ev ery lowest instinct in huma n nature; and deluged the enormous cr owds so gathered with the fi lthy, defamatory and revolution ary output of its printin g presses and d ebating clubs . As Scudder writes in A Prince of the Blood : \"It gave the police more to do than al l the other pa rts of the city .\" It is interesting to note that the general manager installed by the cre ditors at the Palais royal was one de Laclo s, a political adventurer of al ien origin, author of Liaisons Dangereuses, and other pornographi c works, who was said \"to study the politics of love becau se of his lov e for politics .\" This steady stream of corruption and destructive propaganda w as linked with a series of systematic personal attacks of the v ilest and most unscrupulous nature upon any public charact ers whom th e Jacobins thou ght likely to stand in the ir way.

Doubtless the agents of Weishaupt and Mendelssohn reported on to them the contents of the Queen's letter; and we can imagine them shaking wi th laughter, and rubbing their hands in satisfaction; hands that were itching to destroy the very life of France and her Queen; and w hich at the appropriate hour w ould give the signal that would convert secret conspiracy into the \"massacres of September\" and the blood baths of the gu illotine. In order to further the campaign of cal umny against the Queen, an el aborate hoax was arranged at the time, when the financiers and grain speculators w ere deliberately creating cond itions of pov erty and hu nger in Pari s.

The moving sp irit behind the scene was Cagliostro, alias Joseph Balsam o, a Jew from Palermo, a do ctor of the cabalistic art, and a member of the Illumi nati, into which he was in itiated at Frankfurt by Weishaupt in 177 4. When the necklace had finally serv ed its purpose, it was sent ove r to London, where most of the stones were retained by the Jew Eliason. Attacks of a similar nature were directed against many other de cent people, who resisted the influ ence of the Jacobin clubs. After ei ght years of this work th e process of pa ralysis by mastery of publicity was complet e. In every respect therefore b y 1789, when the financi ers forced the King to summon the Estates General, the first portion of their pl ans for revolution (i.e. paral ysis) were accomplished. It now only remained to strike the blo w or series of blows, w hich were to rob France of her throne, her church , her constitution, her nobles, her clergy , her gentry, her bourgeoisie, her traditions, and her culture; leav ing in their place, when the guillotine's work was do ne, citizen hewers of wood a nd drawers of water unde r an alien financi al dictatorshi p. From 1789 onwards a succession o f revolutionary acts w ere set in motion; each more violent than the one precedin g it; each unmasking fresh demands and more violent and revolutionary le aders.

Phillipe Eg alite, Duc d' Orleans, wa s used to prepa re the ground for the rev olution; to protect with his name and influence the infancy of the revolu tionary clu b; to popular ize freemasonry and the Palais R oyal; and to sponsor such acts as the ma rch of the women to Ve rsailles. The \"women\" on this occasion w ere mostly men in disguise. d 'Orleans was under the impression that the King and Queen would be assassinated by thi s mob, and himself proclaimed a democratic King. The real planners of the march, how ever, had other schemes in v iew.

His masters thereafter had no further use for his services; and he very shortly fol lowed his co usin to the gu illotine am idst the exe crations of al l classes. Mirabeau played a simil ar role to that of Egalite. He had intended that the revolution should cease with the setting up of L ouis as a democratic monarch with himself as chief adviser. He had no desir e to see violence done to the King. On the contrary, in the last days before he died m ysteriously by poi son, he exerted all his efforts to g et the King removed from Paris, a nd placed in charge of loyal generals still commanding his army. He was the last of the moderates and monarchists to dominate the Jacobin cl ub of Paris; that bloodthirsty focus of rev olution, which had materiali zed out of the secret clubs of the Or ient Masons an d Illuminati . It was Mira beau's voi ce, loud and r esonant, that kept in che ck the growi ng rage of the murderous fa natics who sw armed therei n.

In his last attem pt to save the royal family by getting them out of Paris, h e actually succeeded in shouting down all opposition in the Jacobin club. That evening he died by a sudden and v iolent illness; and, as the author of The Diamond Necklace writes: \"Louis was n ot ignorant th at Mirabeau had been poi soned.\" Thus, like Phillipe Egalite, and later Danton and Robes Pierre, M irabeau too was removed from the stage w hen his role had been play ed. We are reminded of the passage in Nu mber 15 of th e Protocols of Zion: \"We execute masons in such wise that non e save the brotherhood can ev er have a suspi cion of it.\" And again: \"In this way we shall p roceed with those goy m asons who kno w too much.\" As Mr E.

He evidently became an obstacle to the powers behind the revolution, and was packed off to a war against Austria, w hich the Assembly forced Louis to d eclare. Once he did dash back to Paris in an effort to sav e the King; but he was packed off a gain to the war. Mirab eau's death f ollowed, a nd Louis' fat e was sealed . The wild figures of Danton, Marat, Robes Pierre, and the fanatics of the Jacobin club now domina ted the scene. In September of 1792 were p erpetrated the terrible \"September m assacres\"; 8,000 persons being murdered in the pr isons of Paris alone, and many more over the country. It should be noted here, that these v ictims were arrested and held till the time of the massacre in th e prisons by one Manuel, Procurer of t he Commune. Sir Walter Scott evidently understood m uch concerning the influences which w ere at work behind the scenes. In his Life of Napoleon , Vol. 2, he w rites on page 30: \"The demand of the Commu naute de Pari s, * now the San hedrin of the Jacobins, was, of course , for blood.\" [ * The Paris County Council, equivalent to the L.C.C. in London.] Again, on page 56 he writes: \"The power of the Jacobins w as irresistible in Paris, where Robes Pierre, Danton and Marat sha red the high places in the synagogue.\" Writing of the C ommune, Sir Walter Scott state s in the same w ork: \"The princip al leaders of the Commune seem to hav e been foreig ners.\" Some of the na mes of these \"fo reigners\" are worthy o f note: There was Chlodero de L aclos, manager of the Palais Roy al, said to be of Spanish orig in. There was Manuel, the Procur er of the Commune, already mentioned.

There were Reubel and Gohir, two of the five \"Di rectors,\" who with a Council of Elders became the governmen t after the fall of Robes Pierre, bei ng known as the Directoire. The terms \"Di rectors\" and \"E lders\" are, of course, charac teristically Jewish.

To return to the scene in Paris. Rob es Pierre now remains alon e, and apparently master of the scenes; but this again wa s only appearance. Let us turn to the Life of Robes Pierre , by one G. Renier, wh o writes as though Jewish secrets w ere at his disposal. He writes: \"From April to July 179 4 (the fall of Robes Pierr e) the terror was at its he ight. It was never the dictatorship o f a single man, least of all Robes Pierre. Some 20 men (the Committees of Public Safety and of General Security) shar ed the power.\" To quote Mr. Renier agai n: \"On the 28th July, 1794,\" \"Robes Pie rre made a long speech before the Convention . . . a philippi c against ultra-terrorists. . . uttering v ague general accusations. 'I dare not name them at this mo ment and in this place. I cannot bring myself entirely to tear asunder the veil that cove rs this profound mystery of iniquity. But I can affirm most po sitively that among the authors of this plot are the agent s of that syste m of corrupti on and extr avagance, th e most powerful of all the means in vented by foreigners for the undoing of the Republic; I mean the impure apo stles of atheism, and the immorality that is at its base'.\""},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"23 Mr Renier co ntinues wit h all a Jew 's satisfaction : \"Had he not sp oken these w ords he migh t still have triumphed! \" In this smug se ntence Mr Ren ier unwitti ngly dots th e i's and cro sses the t's, w hich Robes Pierre had left uncompleted. Robes Pierre's allusion to the \"corru pting and secret foreigners\" was getting altogether too near the mark; a little more and the full truth would be out. At 2 a.m. that night Robes Pierre w as shot in the jaw and early on the following day dragged to th e guillotine . Again let us r ecall Protoco l 15: \"In this way we shall p roceed with goy masons who know too much.\" Note: In a somewhat similar m anner Abraham Lincoln was sho t and killed by the Jew Booth on the e vening of h is pronouncem ent to his cabi net that he in tended in futu re to finance U.S. loans on a debt free basis similar to the debt free money known as \"Greenbacks,\" with which he had financed the Civil War. The Russian Rev olution Monsieur Fr ancois Coty , the celebrat ed scent manuf acturer, wro te in Figaro on 20th February, 1932: \"The subsidie s granted to th e Nihilists a t this period (1905-1917) by Jacob Sch iff, of Kuhn Loeb and Co., New York, wer e no longer a cts of isolated generosity . A veritable Russian terro rist organiza tion had been set up at his e xpense. It covered Ru ssia with its emissaries.\" This creation of terrorist formations by Jews within a country marked down for revolution, whether they be called Nihilists or as in Fr ance in 1789, \"Sacred Bands,\" or \"Marseillais\"; or \"Operatives,\" as in th e Britain of Charles I, now stan ds revealed as standard techn ique. Jacob Schiff also financed Japan in her w ar against Russia 1904-5, as we learn from the Jewish E ncyclopedi a. This war was immedi ately followed by an attempt at revolution on a considerable scale in Russia, which, howev er, proved abortive. T he next attempt, during the Gre at War, met with com plete success. On the 3rd January, 1906, the R ussian Foreign Minister supplied to Emperor Nicholas II a report on this revolutiona ry outbreak, which, as rev ealed in the American Hebrew"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"24 of July 13th , 1918, contai ned the follo wing passag es: \"The events which took place in Russia in 1905 . . . plainly indicate that the revolution ary move ment . . . has a definite int ernational ch aracter . . . the revolutionaries possess great qu antities of arms imported from abro ad and very cons iderable fin ancial means . . . one is bound to conclude that there are foreign capitalists' organizations interested in supporting o ur revolut ionary mo vement.

It was to be confirmed by an even more important official document pen ned at the height of the revolution itself, in 1918, by Mr. Oudendyke, the representativ e of the Netherlands Government in St. Petersburg, w ho was in charge of British inte rests in Russia after the liquidat ion of our Em bassy by t he bolshev iks.

Cohen: \"The great R ussian revo lution was indeed accomp lished by t he hands of Jew s.

Dr. Fahey quotes him as saying dur ing this ev idence: \"In December, 1918, out of 388 memb ers of the revolutionary government, only 16 happened to be real Russians; al l the rest were Jews w ith the exception of one U.S. Negro. Two hundr ed and sixty-five of the Jews come from the Low er East Side of N ew York.\" Such has been the condition of affairs in the U.S.S.R. fr om that day to this. Though a number of Jews w ere liquidated in the so-called \"M oscow Purge,\" this affected the situation in no way . It merely signified that one Jewish faction had triumphed over, and liqui dated, another. There has neve r been anything in the natu re of a Gentile r evolt agai nst the Jewis h domination . The fact that some Jews were liquidated by winnin g factions behind the iron curtain could be used to deceive the w orld outside into thinking that this w as the result of an anti-semitic revolt, and from ti me to time a hoax of this kin d has been systematically propaganded .

Finally, we had the flight to the U.S.S.R. with atom secr ets also of the Jew Professor Pontecorvo, who had be en working in close associ ation with Fuchs. No doubt we shall continue to be regaled with plausible stories proving that Russia has gone anti-semitic; but it is not hard to realise that such a Jewish grip ba cked by the most elaborate spy and liqui dation squads known to man, w ould cause a convulsion which wou ld shake the w orld before i ts grip could be broken. Developme nt of Revoluti onary Technique Four revolutions in history merit our special attention. The study and comparison of the methods employed therein will reveal on the one hand a basic similarity between them: and on the other an interesting adv ance in technique, with each succeedin g upheaval. It is as if we studied the var ious stages in the evolution of the modern rifle from the original ol d \"brown Be ss.\" The revolutions in question are firstly the Cromwe llian, secondly the French, thir dly the Russian, and l astly the Sp anish revo lution of 193 6. All four can be proved to h ave been the work of in ternational Jewry. The first three succeeded, and secured the murder of the r eigning monarch and the liquid ation of his supporters. In each case Jewish finance, and underg round intrigue, are clearly traceable; and the earliest measures passed by the re volutionaries have bee n \"emancipation\" for the Jews. Cromwell was financed by various Jews, notab ly Manasseh Ben Israel and C arvajal \"the Great Jew ,\" contractor to his army.

We are all familiar with the ab surd Old Testament passages which the Roundhead rank and file adopted as names, such as Se rgeant Obadiah, \"Bind their Kings in chains and their nobles in fetters of iro n.\" The Cromwellian rev olution was short-lived. The work of destruction had not b een sufficiently thorough to frustrate counter- revolution , and restorat ion of the old regime. A second revolution, the so-called \"Glorious Revolution\" of 1689, was necessary. This again was financed by Jew s, notably Solomon Medina, Suasso, Moses Machado and others. By the French revoluti on of 1789 the technique had been notably improved. Secre t societies had been developed th roughout France on a grand scale i n the preceding years. The plans for the liqu idation of the former regime ar e by this time far more drastic. The judicial murder of a kindl y and well intentione d King and a few nobles is r eplaced by mass mur ders in pr isons an d in privat e houses of the whol e of the no bility, c lergy, gentry and bourgeoisie , regardless o f sex. The Cromw ellian dama ge and desecra tion of a few churches by their tempor ary use as stables is developed into a g eneral wrecking of Christian chu rches, or their conversion into public lav atories, brothels, and markets; and the banning of the practice of the Christian religion and even t he ringing o f church bells. Civil w ar is not allo wed to dev elop. The ar my is side- tracked, and ke pt apart from its King by his seizure at an ear ly stage. So powerful is th e unseen control by 1789 that apparently, the dregs of the F rench population victoriously liquidate all their natural leaders, in i tself a most un natural and s uspicious phen omenon. More suspicio us still is the sudden appea rance of strong bands of arme d hooligans, who march on Paris from Ly ons and Marseilles; and are recorded as being obviously foreigners . Here we have the fir st formations of alien mercenary and criminal elements, forcing revolutions upon a country not their own, which w ere to have their finished a nd expanded p rototype in the Internati onal Brigade s, which atte mpted to force Marxism on Spain 150 years late r.

The national flag of France w ith its lilies and its glories w as banned. Instead the French received the Tricolo ur, badge of murder and rapine . Here, however, the planners mad e a mistake. The Tricolour might not be the honoured and famous flag of Fra nce. It might be dripping with the blood of massacre, regicide and villain y. It might be stinking with the slime of the Jewish criminals w ho designed and foisted it upon the F rench people; but it was proclaimed the national flag, and the national flag it becam e; and with the national fla g came the nat ional army , and a nation al leader, N apoleon. It was not long before this great F renchman ran up against the secret pow ers, who up till then cont rolled the ar mies of Fran ce. They ha d planned to use these armi es to revolutionise all European states, one after another; to overthrow all leadership, and establish rul e of the mob, apparently , in reality of course thei r own. Just in this ma nner do the Je ws today p lan to use the Red Army. Such a policy directe d by aliens of this t ype could not long c ontinue once a nat ional arm y had thrown up a real national leader; thei r outlook and policy must inev itably be poles apart. It w as not long before the First Consul cha llenged and overthrew these aliens and their puppets. By the ye ar 1804 Napo leon had com e to recognise the Jew and his plans as a menace to France and all that the rev olution had swept away he systematically restored. F rom this time onwards Jewish mo ney financed every coalition against him; and Jew s today boast that it w as Rothschild rather than Wel lington wh o defeated Na poleon. Knowing these things, Hitler, on his occupation of Paris, immediately ordered a permanent guard of honour to be mounted over Napoleon' s tomb at the Invalides; and had the body of L'Aiglon (Napoleon's son by Mari a Louisa) brought from Austria, and buried at las t in his prope r place at the side of his fa ther. When we come to examine the Russian revolution we find that the technique is still bolder and far more drastic. On this o ccasion no national flag, army, or anthem is permitted. After the dregs of the commun ity have apparently accomplished the impossible, and liquidated ev ery other class down to and including the kulak (a man with three cows), they are herded into a polygl ot force called the Red Army; over them waves an internationa l red flag, no t a Russian fl ag; their anth em is the Inte rnationale.

Fortunately for Europe, it w as frustrated by General Franco and a number of gallant men, who instantly took the field in opposition to the rev olutionary forces, and succeeded in a long struggl e in crushing them. This achievement is all the more remarkable in view of the latest development in revolutionary organi sation, which was then rev ealed in the shape of the Internationa l Brigades. These International Brigade s, besides representing the very latest novelty in revolution ary techniq ue, were a r emarkable pr oduction. They were recruited fr om criminals, adventurers and dupes, mostly communists, from 52 different countries, mysteriously transported and assembled in formati ons in Spain within a fe w weeks of the outbreak o f disorder, un iformed in a garb closely related to our battle dr ess, and armed with wea pons bearing the Jewish f ive-pointe d star. This star and the Seal of Solomon were upon the signet rings o f N.C.O.s and Officers in this commu nist horde of ill-discipli ned ruffians. I have seen them mysel f in wear.

By the end of that year the red flag was being hoisted in most of the great cities of Europe. In Hungary the Jew Bela Kuhn organised and main tained for some time a mercile ss and bl oody tyrann y similar t o the one i n Russia . In Germ any, the J ews Leibknecht, Barth, Scheidemann, Rosa Lux emburg, etc., made a desperate bid for power. The se and ot her simil ar convul sions s hook Eur ope; but each cou ntry in its own way just f rustrated the onslaughts. In most countries concerned a few v oices were raised in an endea vour to expose the true nature of these evils.

I propose, therefore, to try and gi ve a true picture of its spirit an d purport by quotations from its two main themes: Firstly realisation and ex posure of the Jewish scheme for w orld Marxism; and secondly, admiration of, and lo nging for friendship with Gre at Britain. Writing of the days before 1914, Hitler states: \"I still saw J ewry as a religion ... Of the existe nce of delibe rate Jewish hostility I had no concept ion ... I gradually realised that the Social Democratic Press was prepon derantly controlled by Jews ... There was not a single pape r with which Jews w ere connected which could be described as g enuinely n ational ... I seized all the Social Democratic pam phlets I could get hold of, and looked up the names of th eir authors - - nothing but Jews.\" As he pursued the study of these que stions, Hitler began to perceive the main outlines of the truth: \"I made also a deep study of the relatio n between Ju daism and Ma rxism . . . The Jewish State never h ad boundaries as far as space was con cerned; it was unlimited as regards space, but bound down by its conception of itsel f as a race.

The Jewish doctrine of M arxism rej ects the aristoc ratic princip le in nature . . . denies the value of the indi vidual among men, combats th e importance of nationality and race, thereby depriving humanity of the whole meaning of existence.\" \"Democracy in the west today is the forerunner of Marxism , which would be inconceiva ble withou t Democracy .\" \"If the Jew, with the help of h is Marxian creed, conquers the n ations of the world, his crown w ill be the fu neral wrea th of the huma n race ...\" He writes o f the days of 1918: \"Thus did I now believ e that by defending my self against the Jews I am doing the Lord's wor k.\" At the end of 1918 there came the re volution in Germany organised behind the"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"34 unbroken arm y in the fie ld.

He alway s longed for t heir friendsh ip. Alway s declared Bri tain to be one of the greate st bulwarks against chaos; and that her i nterests and those of Germany w ere complementar y and not co ntrary to o ne another.

The answer is fairly s imple, if onc e the purpose behind the Je wish plan i s understood. \"Out of the last war we brou ght the Soviet States of Russia; out o f the next war we will bring the Sov iet States of Eu rope. . .\" had been the pronouncement at a world meeting of communist parties about 1932. To make the next war possible , therefore, the see-saw must be bal anced again; German strength buil t up, and Brit ish strength w hittled dow n. Then the Europeans can fight each othe r to the death of one and complete exhaustion of the other. A dramatic surprise is in store for both sides. Neither is to be the real w inner. The real winner is quite a different ar my. This army is the one that will receive the real attention. For 25 years it will be built up under conditions of the greatest secrecy. Its leaders will not show the ir strength un til the confli ct is well un der way. Not until a critical moment in the war will the Europe an armies be permitted to guess at the existence of the huge factories be yond the Urals, or of the colo ssal proportions of the heavily mechanised hordes which will then commence to roll westwards over Europe under the red flag of Marxism . [Note: These \"huge factories\" and \"colossal prop ortions of the heavily m echanised hords\" are thanks to the American people , via the Lend Lease A ct , implemented before Americans were sucked into th at war, and minutely d etailed in the Diaries of Major Jordan (George Race y Jordan).— Jackie] In March 1939 a British guarantee to Poland was given by Mr. Chamberlain on the strength of a false report to the effect that a 4 8-hour ultimatum had been del ivered by Germany to the Poles.

Day after day the Bri tish public was deluged w ith war propaganda and misrepresentation of the situation. Final ly their minds were closed against any further regard to the demands of j ustice or reaso n by a new slogan, \"You cannot t rust Hitler' s word.\" With this lie the British public was final ly stampeded into throwi ng all reason and judgment to the winds and accepti ng at their face value the w ar propaganda in the press. This slogan was founded upon a misrepresentation of Hitler's assuran ce given on more than one occasion after a \"putsch\" such as tha t into Sudetenland, that he \"intended to m ake no further demands.\" The misrepr esentation la y in the fac t that the pres s steadily o bscured the ma jor fact, that the \"demands\" to which Hitler referred were all along fi ve fold in character; and covered those five areas taken from Germany by a dictated peace in which the population was overw helmingly German, i.e. Sud etenland, part of Czechoslovakia, parts of Polan d, the Corrid or and Danzi g. As German troops occupied each successive se ction, it is, I believe, accurate to say that Hitler declared, that he had no additional demands to make. But he re it must be clearly stated in the interests of ju stice that he never said that this enta iled reducing the demands which he had ori ginally very clearly delineated, and repe ated on many occasions, name ly, the fiv e areas in qu estion. The British public was delude d by its press into supposing that w hen Hitler said he had no further de mands, that the re had nev er been any statement of h is full deman ds, some of which were still unfulfilled. They wer e led to believe that Hitl er either never had any other demands, or th at he had abandoned the rest as soon a s he had obtained som e of them. When, therefore, the next installment w as added, the press built on this misunderstanding the fallacy that Hitler's word could not be trusted. Honest dealing needs no such trickery and deception. Such methods are only necessary to bolster up bad or unjust causes. Fortunately we have the calm and dispassionate judgment in this matter by no less a person than th e late Lord L othian, recen tly British Ambassador to the U.S.A. In h is last speech at Chat ham House on this subject he remarked: \"If the principle of self-determination h ad been applied in Germany 's favour, as it was applied against her, it w ould have meant the return of Sudetenland, Czechoslova kia, parts of Po land, the Pol ish Corridor , and Danzig to the Reich.\""},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"43 Here is a very differ ent presentment of the case to the one w hich was foisted upon the British public in 1939; and it is the true one. Small wonder tha t these facts had to be withheld fr om the ordin ary citizen . Had the British public realised the truth, that each of these demands of Hitler 's rested on a foundation of reasonable fairn ess, the people of this island woul d have ruled out any question of war; and it was war, not truth or ju stice, upon which international Jew ry was resolved. \"Phoney war\" ended by c ivilian bombing Though a state of war wa s declared to exist between Britain and Germany in September of 1939, it very soon became apparent that no w ar was being conducted by Germany against this co untry. This was no surprise to those w ho knew the facts of the case. Hitler ha d again and again made it clear, that he nev er intended to attack or harm Great Br itain or the British Empire. With the Siegfried Line stro ngly held, and no German intention of appearing west of it, stalemate in the west, or the \"Phoney War,\" as it cam e to be called, must, in the absence of bombing of civilian populations ultim ately peter out altogether. No one was quicker to perceiv e this than the pro-Jewish w ar mongers; and they and their friends inside and outside the H ouse of Commons very soon began exerting pressure for th is form of bom bing of Germ any to be sta rted. On 14th Januar y, 1940, The Sunday Times gave prominence to a letter from an anonymous correspondent, wh o demanded to know why we were not using our air power \"to i ncrease the eff ect of the block ade.\" \"Scrutator,\" in the same issue , commented o n this letter a s follows: \"Such an extensio n of the of fensive wo uld inevit ably develo p into co mpetiti ve frightfulness.

Spaight, C.B., C.B.E., who w as the principal assistant secretary at the Air Mini stry during the war."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"44 As its title suggests, this book is an attempt to justify the indiscriminate use of bombers against the civil population.

On page 64 of his book, Mr. Spaight giv es a further p iece of inform ation, whic h renders this sudden change of British pol icy all the more astonishing; fo r he states that a declaration was made by the British and French Gover nments on 2nd September, 1939, that \"Only strictly military objectives in the narrow est sense of the word would be bombarded.\" This declaration, of course, was mad e in the days of Mr Cham berlain's Premiership; and no single fact perhaps could dema rcate and differentiate more clearly the difference in the character and behavi our between Mr. Chamber lain and Mr. Churchill. On the 27th January, 1940, thirtee n days after the letter in The Sunday Times already quoted, The Daily M ail endorsed editorially the v iews which had been ex pressed in that issue by \"Scrutator\"; an d it devote d a leading a rticle, wri tes Mr. Spaigh t, to combating the suggestion of Mr. Amery and others that we should start the bombing of Germany. Sir Duff Coo per had wr itten on the p revious da y in the sam e paper that \"there wo uld appea r to exist a kind of u nwritten truce be tween the two belligerents, according to the tacit terms of which they do not bomb one another.\" In view of the declaration by Britain and France of September 2nd, 1939, that they would \"onl y bomb mil itary obje ctives in th e narrowest sense of the w ord,\" Sir Duf f Cooper's v erbiage abou t \"a kind of un written tru ce,\" seems to me gravely obscurantist, if honest.

This in spite of the fact that Britain had nothing to ga in by furth er and total w ar, and eve rything to lose. The Jews, of course, had ever ything to lose by a pe ace which left the German gold - free money system and Jew-free Go vernment i ntact, and noth ing to gain.

Having given detail s of how Hitler peremptoril y halted the Panzer Corps on the 22nd May, and kept them inactiv e for the vital few day s, till, in fact, the British troops had got away from Dunkirk, Cap tain Liddell Hart quotes H itler's tele gram to Von K leist: \"The armour ed divisio ns are to rema in at medium artillery range from D unkirk.

M r.

The first tw o of these six consideratio ns were as fo llows: Together with many members of both Houses of Parliame nt, I was fully aware that among the agencies both here and a broad, which had been activ ely engaged in promoting bad feeling betwe en Great Britain and Germany , organised Jewry, for obvious re asons, had pla yed a lead ing part. I knew the U.S.A. to be the headqu arters of Jewry, and therefor e the real, though not apparent, centre of their activities. It was not until 1948 that corrobora tive evidence of the foregoing from unimpeachable American sources came into my h ands; but when it did come, how ever, the a uthentic and f ully docum ented characte r of the wor k left nothing to be desired. I refer to the book by Professor C harles Beard entitled President Roosevelt and the Coming of the War 1941 , which was published by the Yale University Press in April 1948. This book, which comes w ith all the authority of its em inent author, is nothing less than a tre mendous indi ctment of Presi dent Roosev elt on three m ain issues. Firstly, th at he got him self elected o n the strength of repeated p romises, to the effect that he would keep the U.S.A. out of any European war; secon dly, that he incessantly and flagrantly disregarded n ot only his promises to the Am erican people, but all the laws of neutrality ; thirdly, that at a predetermi ned moment he deliberately converted this cold war, which he had been conducting, into a shooting w ar, by sending the Japanese an ultimatum , which no one could imagin e could result in anything bu t immediate w ar. From many instances giv en relating t o the first issu e, I quote one : \"At Boston on October 30th, 1940, he (F.D .R.) was even more em phatic, for there he decl ared: 'I have said this before, but I shall say it again and agai n and again: Your boys are no t going to be sent into any foreign wa rs'; and on Decem ber 29th:"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"52 'You can therefore nail any talk about sending armies to Europe as deliberate u ntruth'.\" Professor Bear d goes on to p rove that w hile Mr. Roo sevelt wa s making these speeches, he was treating internationa l laws of neutrality w ith total disregard, and in the interests only of those who were fighting the Jews' battles. The two main forms of non-shooting intervention w ere the convoying of U .S. ships of ammunition and supplies for t he allies, an d the Lend Le ase Act. Whateve r be our se ntiment s in appre ciating the help o f the U.S . arsena ls and navy under these two cold war decisions of Mr. Roosevelt, no on e can pretend that they were either in accordance w ith his pledges to the American peop le, or the fundamentals of internatio nal law re garding neut rality. Some very plain speaki ng went on i n Congress ov er these acts of the Presiden t's. Representati ve U. Burd ick, of North D akota, said: \"All our aid to Britain ma y mean any thing . . . To sell her supp lies is one th ing . . . to sell her supplies and convoy them is another thing, to hav e actual war is the last thing -- the last thing is inevita ble from the first thing! \" Representati ve Hugh Pa terson, of Geor gia, said: \"It is a measur e of aggressiv e war.\" Representati ve Dewey Short, of Miss ouri, said: \"You cannot be half-way in war, and half-way out of war . . . You can dr ess this measure up all you please (Lend-Lease), you can sprinkle i t with perfume and pour powde r on it . . . bu t it is still fo ul and stinks to high heav en.\" Representati ve Philip Bennett, of Mi ssouri, declar ed: \"This conclusion is inescapable, that the Presi dent is reconciled to active mil itary interventi on if such inte rvention i s needed to de feat the Axi s in this war . But our boy s are not goin g to be sent ab road, says th e President. Nonsense, Mr Chairman; eve n now their berths are being built in our transport ships. Even now the tags for identification of the dead and w ounded are being printed by the firm of Wil liam C. Ball antyne and Co., of Washingt on.\" Professor Bear d proves the third point a t great length , showing ho w at the app ropriate moment President Roosevelt for ced the Japanese into war by an ultimatum demanding instant compliance w ith terms, which could neve r have been accepted by any country ."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"53 \"The memora ndum which Senator Hul l, with the approval o f President R oosevelt, handed to Japan on 26th November, 1941 . . . amounted to the maximum terms of an America n policy fo r the whole Orient.\" writes Profe ssor Beard, an d goes on to sa y: \"It required no profound knowle dge of Japanese history, institutions, and psychology to warrant . . . first that no Japanese C abinet 'lib eral or react ionary,' could have accepted the p rovisions.\" and again la ter: \"The Japanese agent regarded the Am erican memorandum as a kind of ultimatum. T his much at le ast Secretary Hull knew on Novemb er 26th.\" Thus was the period of max imum intervention short of a shooting war terminated, and a save-face forged for Roosev elt to ship U.S. boys over seas without apparently breaking the spirit of his m any promi ses. As the war proceeded the real policy and sympathies of the President became more and more apparent. His deception o f the British and their Allies w as no less flagrant than his decep tion of the Am erican peopl e. As Professor Beard points out on page 57 6:- \"The noble principles of the Four Freedoms, and the Atlantic Charter were for practical purposes discarded in the settlemen ts, which accompanied the progress and f ollowed th e conclusion o f the war. To the validity of thi s statement the treatment of the people of Esthonia, Lithuan ia, Pola nd, Rouma nia, Yugo slavia, Ch ina, Ind o-China, Indones ia, Ital y, Germany an d other place s of the earth bear witne ss.\" Some great driving force w as clearly at work to indu ce a President of the United States so to act. We have seen f rom a prev ious chapter t hat it was no t the preserv ation of the B ritish Empire, nor the French Empire, nor the Dutch, that swayed the President.

For limited Government under supreme law they may substitute personal and arbitrary governmen t -- the first p rinciple of th e totalitaria n system aga inst which it has been alleged that World War II was w aged-while giving lip service to the principle of constitutional governme nt.\" When we reflect upon the astounding conten ts of Professor Beard's book, and consider them in conjunctio n with the r evelations in Colonel Roosevelt 's As He Saw It , the question a rises: whom , and which interests did President Ro osevelt not betray. To this query I can only see one answer, namely , those people and their interests w ho planned from the start the use of Uni ted States arsenals and Forces to prosecute a war which would annihilate a Europe which h ad freed itself from Jewish gold and revolutionary control: p eople who planned to dissolv e the British Empire, to forge chains of unrepayable debt, w herewith to coerce Britain to this end; and to enable the Soviets to \"b estride Europ e like a colos sus,\" * in other wo rds, Internati onal Jewry . * These very word s were used by General Smuts, who added words to the effect that he welcomed such a prospect.

Regulation 18B On the 23rd May, 1940, w ithin the first fortnight of Mr Churchi ll's Premiership, many hundreds of British subjects, a large prop ortion of them ex-Serv icemen, were suddenly arrested and thrown into prison under Regulation 18B.

But there w as not one case of a man arrested under 18B be ing a British subject, who was so charg ed. Four charges were actually framed against one lady, the wife of a distinguished Admiral, Mrs Nicholson. She w as tried by a Judge and jur y, and acquitted on all counts. This ho wever, di d not preve nt her being arrested as she left the Law Courts, acquitted, and being thrown into Holloway Prison un der Regulation 18B, where she remained for years. Regulation 1 8B was orig inally in troduced to de al with cer tain member s of the I.R.A., who were committing a number of senseless minor outrages in London. Without this Regulation, no liege of His Ma jesty in the United Kingdom could be arrested and held in prison on suspicion. This practice had long been aband oned in this country, except in short periods of grave prove n conspi racy, and on those occasi ons Habe as Corpu s was always suspended. 18B enabled the medieval process of arrest and imprisonment on suspicion to be revived without th e suspension of Habeas Corpus. It wa s, in fact, a return to the system of Lettres de Cachet, by which persons in pre-Rev olutionary France wer e consigned to th e Bastille. Here, it shou ld be remem bered, that th ose persons en joyed full social interc ourse with their famili es, and were allowed th eir own ser vants, plate , linen, food and drink w hilst in prison; a very differ ent treatment to that meted out to persons held under 18B, whose treatm ent for some ti me was littl e different fr om ordinary criminals, a nd, in fact, worse than a ny remand prisoner.

Immediately on receipt of this information I put down a quest ion to the Home Secretary, and offered to supply the necessary information if the matter were taken up. Nothing came of my repr esentations. From these Communist-insp ired outrages, however, there resulted Regulation 18B.

Now Comm unism is Jew ish-controlle d. If Marxist Jewry need ed a device for securing the assent of parliament to a regulation like 18B, what simpler method could there be to achieve thi s object, without arousing suspicion as to the real ulterior moti ve , than arranging for a few com munist members of the I.R.A. to plant bombs in the cloakro oms of London stations? Everyone is supposed to b e entitled to their opinion in th is country; and, furthermore, where we cannot supply absolute proof, we can say with the Home Secretary , as I do here, that I have \"reasonable cause to believe\" that this is the real story behind Regulation 1 8B's enactmen t.

For the wo rds \"Home Sec retary is sa tisfied that,\" h ad been substi tuted, \" Has reasonable cause to believ e that .\" The Government spokesmen ex plained at length on this occasion that thi s wording gave the required safeguard. Members of Parliament were led to believe that their wishes had prevailed, an d that they were to be th e judges of what would or would not be \"Reasonable Cause\" for continued d etention (as was proved i n subsequent debates), and a rather uneasy H ouse passed the Clause in this form, and on that understandin g.

Who Dares? On the morning following my release from Brix ton Prison, I proceeded to the House of Commons at my usual hour of 10.15 a.m.; an action which app eared to cause no little surprise. It was not long before Jew s and their friends were on m y trail, and that of the Right Club. A string of provocative qu estions soon appeared on the Order Pa per; but, like Gallio who, when the Jews took Sosthenes, and beat him before the Judgm ent seat, \"cared for none of th ese things,\" I g ave no sign of interest.

The most important rev elation therein is dated the 27th D ecember, 1945 (pages 121 an d 122): \"Played golf today with Joe Kennedy (Joseph P.

He records conversatio ns with Mr. Byrnes and Senator Vand enberg, Gov ernor Dewe y and other s, in attempts to lift the Palestine question o ut of party politics. From this ti me on he would seem to have ma de continuous efforts with that end in v iew. The Diary records on the 3rd Feb., 19 48 (pages 362 and 363): \"Visit today from Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr., who came in with strong advocacy of a Jewish State in Palestine, that we should support the United Nations 'decision', I pointed out that the United Nation s had as yet taken no 'decision' , that it was only a recommendation of th e General Assembly and that I thought the methods that had been used by people outside of the Executive b ranch of the Government to bring coercion and duress on other nations in the Gen eral Assembly bo rdered closel y onto scand al . . .

No man can serve two masters, more especially when the principle s and interest s of these two masters are a s widely divergent as are those of Britain an d her Empire , and Jewry and their Em pire, the U.S .S.R.

In Phase II, I recognised the forces behind Bol shevism not to be Russian, but internationa l. I tried to picture the composition of t hat mysterious body, the Comintern, over whom, according to the replies to my Parliamentary questions, the Sov iet Government could exercise no control. In the latter end of this phase I had m ade sufficient progress with this mental picture of the Cominter n, that I made it the subject of a number of addresses, w hich I gave to Rotary Clubs and other societi es in London, Edinburgh, and elsew here, entitling them frequently , \"Red Wings Ov er Europe.\" This second ph ase lasted w ell into the Spanish Civ il War.

This quo ted verbati m an extra ct from a report received by Mr. Balfour on September 19th, 1 918, from Mr. Oudendyke, the Netherla nds Minister i n Petrograd, who was a t that time in charge of Bri tish interests ther e, as follow s: \"The danger is now so great, th at I feel it my duty to call the attention of the British Government and all other Governments to the fact that if an end is not put to Bolshevism at once the civ ilization of the whole w orld will be threatened. T his is not an ex aggeration, b ut a matter of fact . . . I consider that the immediate suppression of Bolshevism is the greatest issue before the world, not ev en excluding the war w hich is still raging, and unless as above stated Bolshevism is nipped in the bud immediatel y it is bound to spread over Europe and the w hole world in one form or another, as it is organized and worked by Jews, w ho have no nationality and whose one object it is to d estroy for their ow n ends the ex isting order of things."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"67 The only manner in w hich this danger can be averted would be collective actio n on the part of all the Pow ers.\" Almost as rem arkable as the above quo tation was th e fact brought to my noti ce simultaneously, namely, that this White Paper had been immediatel y withdrawn, and replaced by an abridged e dition, from which these v ital passages had been eliminated. I was shown the two White papers-the or iginal and t he abridged issue, side by side. The second document which came to my notice at this time w as the booklet entitled, The Rulers of Russia , written by Dr. Denni s Fahey, C.S.S.P., and bearing the imprimatur of the Archbishop of Du blin, dated the 26th March, 1938. In the opening sentence of thi s pamphlet Dr Fahey w rites: \"In this pamph let I present t o my reade rs a number o f serious docum ents which go to show that the real forces beh ind Bolshevism are Jewi sh forces; and that Bolshevism is really a n instrument in the hands of the Jew s for the establishment of their futur e Messianic ki ngdom.\" Dr. Fahey then adduces a n interesting volume of evidence. On page 1 he gives also the followi ng passage by Mr. Hilaire Belloc, taken from the latt er's Weekly, d ated 4th February, 1937: \"As for anyo ne who does not know tha t the present r evolutiona ry Bolshev ist movement in Russia is Jew ish, I can only say that he must be a man who is taken in by the suppressio n of our depl orable Press.\" Other authorities quoted in the pamp hlet include Dr. Homer, D. Sc., Co unt Leon de Poncins in hi s Contre-Revolution , and evidence given on 12th February, 1919, be fore a Committee of the United States Senate by the Rev . George A. Si mons, Superintendent of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Petrograd from 1907 to October 6th 1918. The Rev. Mr. Simons stated o n this occasion with regard to the Bolshevik Government in Petrograd : \"In December 1918 . . . under the Pr esidency of a man known as Apfelbaum (Zinoviev) . . . out of 388 members, only 16 ha ppened to be real Russians, and all the rest (with the ex ception of one man, who is a N egro from North America) were Jews . . . and 265 of these Jews belonging to this Northe rn Commune Governmen t that is sittin g in the old S molny Insti tute come from the Lower E ast Side of New York -- 265 of them.\" On page 8 Dr Fahey quo tes figures sho wing that i n the year 1936: \"The Central Committee of the C ommunist Party in Moscow, the very centre of International Communism, consisted of 59 members, of w hom 56 wer e Jews,"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"68 and the other three were married to J ewesses . . . \" \"Stalin, present ruler of Russia, is not a Jew, but he took as his second wi fe the twenty-one year o ld sister of the Jew L.M. Kaganov itch, his right-hand man, who has been spoken of as his probable or possible successor. Stalin's every movement i s made under Jewish ey es.\" In addition to these documen ts there now reached me a quantity o f evidence concerning Jewish activities in Great Britain in the shape of subv ersive organizations of every description, anti-religi ous, anti-mor al, revolu tionary, an d those work ing to establish the Jewish syst em of financi al and indust rial monopo ly. Thus I became finally co nvinced of the fact that th e Russian and Spanish rev olutions, and the subversive societies in Britain, were part and parcel of the one and the same Plan, se cretly op erated a nd contr olled by W orld Jewr y, exactly on the lines laid down in the Protocols of the Elders of Zion , filed in the British Museum in 1 906 (which had been repr oduced s oon afte r the las t war by The Morning Post , and from which this newspaper n ever recov ered). These Protoco ls are no forg ery, and I a nd others coul d supply ev idence to that effect that would convince an y impartia l Tribunal. At the next meeting of th e patriotic an d Christian s ocieties, I fel t in duty bo und to broach the Jewish question; and rea lized, very soon, that there had come a parting of the ways. With very fe w excepti ons our co-ope ration ceased . I realized that if anything w as to be done, some special group w ould have to be formed which, while retaining the essential characteristics of the former one, w ould take up the task of opposing and exposing the Jewish menace. It was then that the idea of the Right Club originated, though th e actual formation did not actually come about till some months l ater, in May 1939. From the aut umn of 1938 o nwards, I spe nt many hou rs a week tal king to back- benchers and m embers of the Governmen t alike on the se subjects. The very magnitude of the issues involved pu t many off. One particular rejo inder typifies in my recoll ection this sor t of attitude: \"Well, that is all very disturbin g, awful, in fact: but what is o ne to do about it? I shall go off n ow and try and forget al l about it as s oon as possibl e.\" About the end of 1938 , news was brought to me th at the control shares of the Daily Mail were for sal e.

He had refused to comply w ith some demands they had m ade of him affecting his works. After a final warning , which he ignored, a w orld boycott had been started against him, which had become effective in 24 hours, where ver he had agents or offices. Fires and strikes also mysteriousl y occurred. The resulting losses ha d finally compelled hi m to give i n. Within 24 hours the boycott w as lifted all over the w orld. The consistent mis-reporting of importa nt features in the Spanish Civi l War had deeply impressed ma ny M.P.s.

In the course of these conversations I obtai ned the support of Members of all p arties to the Bill I w as preparing in this conne ction.

I now took the decision to proceed a t once with the formation of a g roup similar in character to the group of representativ es of Christian and patriotic societies, w hich I had worked with up to the emergence of the Jewish proble m; but this time a group which wou ld place oppo sition to that menace in the forefront of i ts activitie s. Mr. Cross wa s the Secretary , and the late duke of Welling ton, Presiden t of the Liber ty Restoration L eague, was t he Chairman at most of the few meeting s we held. T he first object of the R ight Club w as to enlighte n the Tory Party and clear it from any Jewi sh control. Organized Jewry was now clearly out for World War. The failure of their International Brigade in Spain, and the grow ing exposure of themselv es, and the consequent risk of total collapse of their plan rendered im mediate wa r from their point of vi ew imperat ive. In July 1939 I had an interview w ith the Prime Minister. I dealt w ith the Russian Revolution, and the part Jew ry had played in i t; and with the Spanish Rev olution, prepared and carried out on simi lar lines by much the same people; with the subversiv e societies in Britain, and the Press and news control existing i n this country . I finally drew the Pri me Minister's attention to the under ground work that was going on with the ob ject of over throwing h is peace poli cy and hims elf, and preci pitating the w ar. Mr. chamberlain considered that charge s of so grave and far-reaching a character would require very substantial documentary proof. I de cided to collect documentary proof which would make it possible for action to be taken. The outbreak of war enabled the Jews to give their activities the cloak of patriotism. Their press power enabled them to portray those opposing their designs and exposing them as pro-N azi, and dislo yal to Brit ain. The difficulty I was faced w ith was that while I w as in duty bound to war n the country against the con sequences of a policy infl uenced by O rganized Jew ry and opp osed to British interests, I, at the same time, did no t want to create difficulties for Mr. Chamberlai n. It was decided therefore, that the Ri ght Club should close down for the duration. The spirit of the Club naturally led the younger member s to join the Services, wher ein they have served with distinction on most fronts. It was in keepi ng with the same spirit that others not so engaged, should continue to fight the internal enemy, no less formidable than the Axis Powers and in a way more dang erous, owing to his secret methods an d"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"71 the fact that he can work fro m within a s well as fro m without. To this end, therefore, I and others in an individual capacity disseminated on occasion some leaflets of mine called Do Y ou Know? and Have You Noticed?; my v erses beginning \"Land of dope and Jew ry\", and some anti-Jewish stickers. T his was with the idea of educating the public sufficiently to maintain the atmosphere in w hich the \"phoney\" war, as it w as called, might be converted i nto an honourable negotiated peace. It was certainly not defeatist, as Jew ish propaganda tried to make out. It w as not we of the Right Club who w ere holding back from the fighting Services in this war, any more than in that l ast; quite the contrary. I was determined to make further efforts to convince Mr. Chamberl ain, and even perhaps the 1922 Committee, of the truth of my case, and thus av ert total war, and commenced re inforcing the documentary evidence a lready in my possessio n. By January 1940 , I had details of nearly thirty subversive societies wo rking on various revolutionary and corr osive lines, and had completed a very large chart, sho wing the principal me mbers of each. Six names stood out clearly, as a sort of interlock ing directorate. They were Prof. H. Laski, Mr. Isra el Moses Sieff , Prof. Herma n Levy, M r. Victor Goll ancz, Mr. D.N. Pritt, M.P., and Mr. G.R. Strauss, M .P. In February 1940, on my arrival in London, I w as handed the literature of a new group, who were advocating FEDERAL UN ION. The list of supporters' names was st artling. It might have been copied from the chart I had just completed. There could be no mistake as to the source of this scheme. Later, w hen this group became active, I p ut down the fol lowing que stions: Captain Ramsay asked the Prim e Minister w hether he cou ld assure the House that the creation of a Federal Uni on of the European States is not one of the war aims of H.M.' s Governme nt. Mr. Butler (on May 9th) gave a non-committal reply. To this I asked the following supplementar y: Captain Ramsey : Is my right Hon. Friend aware that this plan, if adopted, will arouse hostility against us in al most the whole of Europe, w ho look upon it as the setting up of a Judeo-Masonic super-State? (Note -- The Protocols of the Elder s of Zion make it clear that World Jewr y and Orient Masonry will set up just such a regime after the Gentile States have been reduced by War and Revolu tions to hewers of wood and drawers of water.)"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"72 Mr. Butler : I would ra ther leave my Hon.

Fearing less the Home Secretary might be inclined into this direction, which wa s a false direction, I asked him on May 9th, 1940: Captain Ramsay : Whether he will give an assurance that care will be taken, both in the administration of the pr esent regulations, and in framing re vised ones, that a distinction is made betw een anti-Semitism and pro-Nazism?

This Organisation, in reality, w as designed secretly to spread subversiv e and defeatist views amo ng the civil population of Great Britain, to obstruct the war effor t of great Britain, and thus to endange r public safety and the defen ce of the Real m. Reply The formation of the Right Clu b, as the attached memorandum show s, was the logical outcome of many years o f work against Bolshevism, carr ied on both inside and outside the House of C ommons, and w ell-known to all my p olitical coll eagues since 1 931. The main object of the Right C lub was to oppose and ex pose the activities of Organized Jewry, in the l ight of the evidence whi ch came into my possession in 193 8, some of whi ch is given in the memo randum. Our first objective was to clea r the Conservative Par ty of Jewish influence, and th e character of our membership and me etings were strictly in keepi ng with this objective. There wer e no other an d secret purpo ses. Our hope wa s to avert w ar, which w e considered to be mainly the work of Jewish intrigue centred in New Y ork. Later, I and may others hope d to turn the \"phoney\" war into, not total war, but an honourable negotiated pe ace. It is difficult to imagine a body of persons less capable of being \"subv ersive\" as this Particular su ggests, and cou pling this cha rge with th e charge of be ing 'defeati st\" places this w hole Particul ar in the rea lm of the lud icrous. . (Particular (ii): In furtherance of the real objects of the Organisation, the said RAMSAY all owed the na mes of th e members of the Org anisati on to be kn own only to himself, and took great precautions to see that the register of mem bers did not leav e his possessio n or control; and stated tha t he had taken steps to mislead the Police and the Intellig ence Branch of the War Office as to the real activities of the Organisation.

Particular (iii): Frequently expressed sympathy with the p olicy and aims of the German Government; and at ti mes expressed his desire to co-ope rate with the German government in the conquest and subsequent government of Great Britain. Reply The latter half of this Particular is a fabrication so preposterous that I propose to treat it with the con tempt it deser ves. Lord Marley embroidere d this fiction in the Lords a few days after my ar rest, insinuating that I had undertaken to be Gauleiter of Scotland under a Germ an occupation of G reat Britain. My solicitors at once invi ted him to repeat his remarks outside. N eedless to say, he did not do so, for there is not a shred of j ustification for either this Particular or h is slanders. The term \"sympathy w ith the policy and aims of the German Government\" is misleading to the verge of d ishonesty. It suggests some general agre ement or understandin g. Nothing of th e kind exis ted. I have nev er been to Ge rmany, and beyond on e formal lun cheon at their Embassy knew no Ger mans. What little I had learne d about the N azi system d id not appeal to me. I have never approv ed of the idea of movemen ts on distantly similar lines be ing formed in Britain. On the contrary, I di sapproved My view was that the Unionist Par ty, once enl ightened, w as the body best suited to take the needful counter-measures to the Jew ish plan, and that to do so successfully it did not eve n need to go o utside the pow ers latent in our Constitut ion. In a general way my views con cerning Germ an aspiration s coincided ex actly with those expressed by Lord L othian in his speech at Chatham Ho use on 29th June, 1937, when he sai d: \"Now if the principle of self-de termination were applied on behalf of Germany in"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"77 the way in which it was applied against her, it would mean the re-entry of Austria into Germany , the union of the Sudeten- Deutch, Danzi g and possibl y Memel w ith Germany, a nd certain ad justments wi th Poland in Silesia and t he Corridor .\" The only as pect of t he Nazi po licy which contac ted in any s pecial wa y with my views was the opposition to the disruptiv e activities of Organized Jewr y. No patriot -- British, French, German or of any o ther nationality -- is justified in abandoning the defence of his country to that onslau ght, once he h as recognized its reality . To confuse sy mpathy on t his one and l oyal point with sym pathy wit h the whole Nazi policy and aims is dishonest; to d evelop this fallacy into a charge of preferring that system to our own, and bei ng prepared to force that system (o f which I disapproved) upon my ow n country, i s the last wo rd in infamy .

Reply. Again we have here the fabrication of the wholly unjustifiable charge of a secret and disloyal p urpose, alrea dy dealt w ith in Particu lar (i), and my Memor andum. In regard to the matter of members of the Right Club and Gov ernment offices, I would say this: The objects of the Club being to spr ead as rapidly as possible the truth concerning the Jewish dang er, time wa s always a vital facto r. From the o utset we w ere in a race with the Jewish p ropagandists. To counter th em in as many different sph eres as possibl e was obv iously the quickest method. Ten members in ten differ ent spheres would spread our i nformation more widely, more quickly than ten mem bers all in th e same office o r club. Every political group must follow these lines; this metho d is the common practice of all political pa rties. I never at a ny time ma de any effo rt to get any member a jo b in any Go vernment O ffice. If a member had a choice of tw o jobs, and didn't mind w hich he or she took, and asked me about it, I should clearly have replied that as far as the Club was concerned, the sphere in w hich we had no member to preach the go spel was the one to choose. For the knowledge to reach such places as the foreign Office, War Office, etc., was obviously to achieve the enlighte nment of infl uential perso ns most rapidl y of all."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"78 Particular (v): After the outbreak of war, associated w ith and made use of persons known to him to be activ e in opposition to the interests of Great Britain.

It does not pretend to cov er the entire field of German-Polish relations but, as the title implies, concern s itself solely with the last phase of the German -Polish crisis, from August 4th to September 3rd, 1939. the Polish-german controversy concerning the Corridor, Upper Silesia and Danzig, began in 191 9; it has nev er, since the si gning of the V ersailles Tr eaty, ceased to agitate europ e.

Britain contends th at the British \"guar anty\" was merely the consequence o f the German d emand of Mar ch 21st. Britain denies that her \"guaranty \" stiffened Polish resistance. She insists that German y took advantage of a moment of highly strained international tension by springing upon Poland her d emand for an extra-terr itorial road through the C orridor betw een the Reich and East Prussi a. The British i gnore a vi tal fact in thi s connection. T he existence of the \"guara nty\", not its formal annou ncement, wa s the decisiv e factor. The future may reveal w hen the Briti sh promise wa s first dangle d before Pola nd. In any e vent, Polan d was assured of British aid before March 21st. Chamberlai n's speech of m arch 17, 1939 , and the state ment by Lor d Halifax of March 20th, (both reprinted in the British Blue Book) leave no doubt o n that question.

The allegations that the Poles w ere surprised or overwh elmed by the German proposals, do es not hold w ater. Poland was fully informed of the German de mands. When as Herr von Ribbentrop po ints out in his Danzig speech (October 24, 1939) chancellor H itler in 193 4 concluded a Friendship a nd Non-Aggr ession Pact w ith Marshal Pilsudski, it was clearly understood that the problem of Dan zig and the Corridor must be solved soon er or later. Chancellor Hitler hoped that it would be solved wi thin the fram ework of tha t instrument. Poland callously disregarded her obligations under the German -Polish Pact, after the death of Marshal Pilsudski. The persec ution of German minorities in Poland, Poland's measures to str angle Danzig economicall y, the insol ent manner th e Polish Governmen t chose to adop t with the Br itish blank ch eck in its pocke t and the Poli sh mobilization frustrated chancellor Hitl er's desire to settle Polish-German d ifferences by peaceful negotiation, as he had solv ed every other probl em arising from the bankruptcy o f statesmanship at Versaille s. No one can aff irm that the N ational Socia list Govern ment did not attempt with extraordinary patience to impress upon Poland the desirabi lity of a prompt and peaceful solution.

The retur n of the Free City of Da nzig to the Re ich, withou t severance of its economic ties to the Polish State. (The a rrangement vouchsafed to Poland free port privileges and extra- territorial access to the harbor.) 2.) An exterritorial [sic] route o f communication through the Corrid or by rail and motor to reunite Ge rmany and East Prussia. 3.) Mutual re cognition by the two Stat es of their fro ntiers as fina l and, if nece ssary, a mutual guara nty of their territories. 4.) The ex tension of the German-Poli sh Pact of 1934 from ten to tw enty-fiv e years. On January 5, 1939, Poland' s Foreign Minister, Josef Beck, conferred w ith the German chancellor on the problem s involved. At this time C hancellor Hitler offered Beck a clear and definite guaranty covering the Corridor, on the basis of the four points outlined by von Ribbentrop. The following day, January 6th, at Mun ich, the German Foreign Minister once m ore confirmed Germany's w illingness to guaranty, not only the C orridor, but all Polish te rritory. The generous offer for a settlement al ong these line, liquidating all friction between the two countries, was reiterated w hen Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop paid a state vi sit to Warsaw (January 23rd to 17th, 1 939). On that occasion von Ribbe ntrop again offered a guaranty of the Poli sh-German boundaries and a final all-inclusive settlement of German-Po lish relatio ns. Under the circumstances it is absurd to all ege that Poland was \"surprised\" by the German proposal of March 21st, and sub sequent developments.

This caused the Reich Governm ent to inform the Polish Gover nment, on August 9th, that a repetition of such demands in the form of an ultimatum woul d lead to an aggravation of the relations b etween Germany and P oland, for the consequences of which the Po lish gover nment woul d alone be re sponsible. At the same time, the attention of the Pol ish Government was draw n to the fact that the maintenance of the economic measur es adopted by Poland against D anzig would force the Fre e City to se ek other exp ort and impo rt possibiliti es (Document 4).

On August 25th , he receiv ed the British Ambassador, o nce more wi th complete frankness explained to him his co nception of the situation, and communicated to him the main principles of comprehensiv e and far-sighted agreement betw een Germany and England which he w ould offer to the British Govern ment once the problem of Danzig and th e Polish Cor ridor was se ttled (Docume nt 8). 4). while the British gov ernment were discussing the precedi ng declaration from the Fuhrer, and exchange of lette rs took place between the French President, M. Daladier, and the Fuhrer. In his answer the Fuhrer again submitted his reasons for Germany's standpoint in the German P olish questio n and once mo re repeated h is firm decisi on to regard the pr esent Franco- German fronti er as final (D ocuments 9 and 10). 5). In their answer to the step taken by the Fuhrer on August 25th , which was handed over on the evening of August 28th, the British Governm ent declared themselves prepared to consider the proposal for a revision of Anglo-German relationships. They further stated that a they had receiv ed a definite assurance from the Polish Governmen t that they w ere prepared to enter into direct discussi ons with Th e Reich Governmen t on German-P olish questio ns. At the same tim e they repe ated that in th eir opinion s a German-Po lish settleme nt must be safeguarde d by intern ational guar antees (Docum ent 11). Despite grave misgivi ngs arising from the whole o f Poland's previous attitude an d despite justifiable doubts in a sincere w illingness on the part of the Polish G overnment for a direct settlement, the Fuhrer, in his answer handed to the British Ambassador on the afternoon of August 29th, accepted the Bri tish proposal and declared that the Reich Gove rnment awa ited the arri val of a Po lish represen tative inv ested with plenipotentiary powers on August 30th. At the same time the F uhrer announced that the Reich Gov ernment wo uld immedia tely draft p roposals for a solution accep table to them and would, if possible, ha ve these ready for the B ritish Government before the Polish negoti ator arriv ed (Document 12). 6). In the course of August 30th, neither a Polish negotiator with plenip otentiary powers nor any commun ication from the British Governm ent about steps undertaken by them reached Berlin. On the contrary, it was on this d ay that the Reich Govern ment"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"94 were informed of the orderi ng of a general Polish mobilization (document 13 ). Only at midnight did the B ritish Ambassador hand over a new memorandum w hich, however, failed to disclose any practical progress in the trea tment of Polish-German questions and confined itself to a statement tha t the Fuhrer's answer of the p receding day was to be communicate d to the Polish Government an d that the British Government considered it impracticable to establish a German-Polish contact so early as on August 30th (D ocument 14). 7). Although the non-appearance of the Polish negotiator had done aw ay with the conditions un der which th e British gov ernment we re to be infor med of the Re ich government's conception of the b asis on which negotiations might be possible, the proposals since formulated by the Reich were none the less comm unicated and explained in detail to the British Ambassador when he ha nded over the above- mentioned m emorandum. The Reich Go vernment e xpected that now at any rate, subseque ntly to this , a Polish plenipotentiary would be appointed. Instead, the Polish Ambassador in Berlin made a verbal dec laration to th e Reich Mini ster for Fore ign Affairs on the afternoon of August 31st, to the effect that the Polish Governm ent had been informed in the pr eceding night by the British gov ernment that there was a possibil ity of direct negotiations between the Reich Gove rnment and th e Polish Gov ernment, and that the Poli sh Governmen t were fav orably con sidering the British propo sal. When expressly asked by the Reich Minister for Foreign Affair s whether he had the authority to negotiate on the Ge rman proposals, the Ambassador stated that h e was not entitled to do so, but had merel y been instructed to make the fore going verbal declaration. A further question from the Reich Minister for Foreign Affair s whether he could enter into an objective discussion on the matter was ex pressly denied by the Ambassador. 8). The Re ich Gover nment th us were co nfronte d with the fact tha t they had s pent two days waiting in v ain for a Polish plenipotentiary . On the evening of August 31st, they published the German proposals w ith a short account of the events lead ing up to them (Document 15 ). These proposa ls were desc ribed as unac ceptable by Polish broad cast (Documen t 16). 9). Now that every possibility for a peaceful settlem ent of the Polish-German crisis wa s thus exhaust ed, the Fuhre r saw himse lf compelled to resist by force the force which the Poles had long employ ed against Danzig, against the German s in Poland, and finally, by innumerabl e violatio ns of the front ier, against G ermany. 10). On the ev ening of Sept ember 1st, the Ambassadors o f Great Britai n and France handed to the Reich Minister for Foreign Affairs two notes couched in the same terms"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"95 in which th ey demande d that German y should w ithdraw he r troops from Polish territo ry, and dec lared th at if thi s demand were not co nceded, their res pective Governmen ts would ful fill their ob ligations to P oland with out further de lay (Docum ents 18 and 19). 11). In order to banish the menace o f war, which had come da ngerously close in consequence of these two notes, the Duce m ade a proposal for an armistice and a subsequent conference for the settlement of the G erman-Polish conflict (Document 20). The Germans and the French Gov ernment replied in the affirmati ve to this proposal whilst the B ritish Gove rnment refuse d to accept it ( Documents 21 and 11). That this was so was already apparent in the speeches made by the British Pr ime Minister and the British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the a fternoon of September 2n d in the Briti sh Houses of Pa rliament, an d a communica tion to that ef fect was made to the Reich Mini ster for Foreign Affairs by the Italian Ambassador on the evening of September 2 nd. Thus also in the opini on of the Itali an Governm ent the initiative of the Duce had been wrecked by England . 12). On September 3rd, at 9 a.m., the British Ambassador arrived at th e German Foreign Office and handed over a note in which the British Government, f ixing a time limit of two hours, repeated the ir demand for a withdraw al of the German troops and, in the event of a refusal, declared themselves to be at war with Germany after this time limit had ex pired (Docum ent 23). The British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on September 3r d, 1939, at 11:15 a. m. delivered a note to the German Charge d'Affairs in Lon don in which he informed him that a state of war ex isted between the two countrie s as from 11 a. m. on September 3r d (Document 2 4). On the same day, at 11:30 a. m . the Reich Minister for Foreign Affairs handed to the British Ambassador in Berlin a me morandum from the Reich Gov ernment in which the Reich rejected the demands ex pressed by the British Gove rnment in the form of an ultimatum and in which it w as proved that the responsibility for the outbreak of war rested solely with the Br itish Gover nment (Docum ent 25). On the afternoon of September 3rd, the French Ambassador in Berlin call ed on the Reich Minister for Foreign Affair s and inquired whether the R eich government were in a position to give a sati sfactory answ er to the ques tion directed to them by the French government in their note o f September 1st. The Reich Minister for Foreign Affairs told the Ambassador that after the English and French Notes of September had be en handed to him, the Head of the Ital ian Government had made a new intermediary proposal, to w hich the Duce had added, th e French Gov ernment had agreed."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"96 The Reich Government had informed the Duce on the precedi ng day that they w ere also prepare d to accept the proposal. The Duce however ha d informed them later on in the day that his proposal had be en wrecked by the intransig ent attitude o f the British G overnment . The British Government sev eral hours previously had presented German with an ultimatum which had been r ejected on the German side by a memorandum which he, the Reich Minister for Foreign A ffairs, would hand over to the French Ambassador for his informati on. Should the attitude of France towards Germany be determined by the same considerations as that of the British Gov ernment, the Reich Minister for Fo reign Affairs could only regret this fact. German y had always sough t understanding with France. Should the French Governm ent, despite this fact adopt a hostile attitude tow ards Germany on account of their obl igations towards Poland, the Germ an people would regard this as a totally unjustifi able aggressive war on the part of France against the Reich. The French A mbassador rep lied that he u nderstood fro m the remarks of the Reich Minister for Foreign Affairs that the Reich Government were not in a position to give a satisfactory answer to the French Note of September 1st. Under these circum stances he had the un pleasant task o f informing t he Reich Gov ernment that the French Government were forced to fulfill the obligations which they had entered into tow ards Poland, from September 3 rd at 5 p.m. o nwards. The French Ambassador at the same time handed over a correspon ding written communicatio n (CF, Docum ent 26). The Reich Mi nister for Fo reign Affairs thereupon de clared in con clusion the th e French Government would bea r the full responsibility for th e suffering which the nations w ould have to bea r if Franc e attack ed German y."}]
