each the bloom or blight, And the choice goes by forever, ’twixt that darkness and that light. Then to side with truth is noble, when we share her wretched crust, Ere her cause bring fame and profit, and ’tis prosperous to be just; Then it is the brave man chooses while the coward stands aside, Till the multitude make virtue of the faith they had denied. By the light of burning martyrs, Christ, Thy bleeding feet we track, Toiling up new Cavalries ever with the cross that turns not back; New occasions teach new duties, ancient values test our youth; They must upward still and onward, who would keep abreast of truth. Though the cause of evil prosper, yet the truth alone is strong; Though her portion be the scaffold, and upon the throne be wrong; Yet that scaffold sways the future, and behind the dim unknown, Standeth God within the shadow, keeping watch above His own. ~ James Russell Lowell, 1845 "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 7 Recognition of a Conspiracy When we see a lot of framed timbers, different portions of which we know have been gotten out of different times and places, and by different workmen...and when we see those timbers joined together, and see they exactly make the frame of a house or a mill...in such a case we find it impossible NOT to believe that...all understood one another from the beginning, and all worked upon a common plan, drawn up before the first blow was struck. ~ President Abraham Lincoln 1 "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 8 Chapter 1: The Big Lie “All this was inspired by the principle - which is quite true in itself - that in the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods. It would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously. Even though the facts which prove this to be so may be brought clearly to their minds, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think that there may be some other explanation. For the grossly impudent lie always leaves traces behind it, even after it has been nailed down, a fact which is known to all expert liars in this world and to all who conspire together in the art of lying. These people know only too well how to use falsehood for the basest purposes.” ~ Adolf Hitler, 1925 Mein Kampf \"Sometimes the truth is so precious it must be accompanied by a bodyguard of lies.\" ~ Donald Rumsfeld, U.S. Secretary of Defense, 25 Sept. 2001 Pentagon Briefing On that horrifying and tragic Tuesday morning of September 11 th , we all witnessed the most worse and despicable attack on American soil and we saw it transpire live on the television. All across the country, time came to an abrupt standstill. The emotions experienced by Americans ranged from the initial morbid “rubber-necking” curiosity and shock of seeing the aftermath of first tower struck, the North Tower, in flames and billowing thick dark black smoke into the beautiful clear blue sky from an apparent accidental impact, to the horrors of witnessing dozens of"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 9 terrified and doomed people leaping to their sudden and violent deaths, to the millions of hands cupped to their mouth’s and the simultaneous nation-wide out crying of expletives or “Oh My God No! No! No! No! No!” as we all tried unsuccessfully to mentally will away and divert the second oncoming aircraft. The emotions, the fear, and the rivers of flowing tears switched into a high gear of a purely instinctive fear-based and primal survival mechanism as we witnessed the second airliner ominously approach at high speed and then bank into the South Tower and erupt into a massive fireball. We instantaneously became aware that this country was under an attack of profound magnitude and we experienced the growing and persistent fear of not knowing what was yet to come. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, then meeting with U.S. Rep. Christopher Cox (R-CA) at the Pentagon for missile defense discussions, predicted with amazing accuracy that the attacks were just the beginning and saying: “Let me tell ya, I’ve been around the block a few times. There would be another event.” 2 The impacts of the airliners into the World Trade Center Twin Towers were just the beginning in that insufferably long day of horrors. We had to witness the unpreced- ented total collapse of two of the world’s premiere and once record tallest skyscrapers, and a third by day’s end, not knowing how many people, and their selfless heroic police and fire rescuers, had perished. Within minutes of Rumsfeld’s amazing display of his powers of prophecy, we learned that the Pentagon was attacked and stricken by Flight 77, and also that a passenger jet had crashed into a field in western Pennsylvania, with all lives lost. Throughout the day and evening, 24-hour cable and broadcast news continuously replayed the graphic images of the obscene attacks ad infinitum, drilling the images into our conscious and sub-consciousness mind, thereby repeating the terror and conditioning the public to easily accept the placement of blame on the soon-to-be-unveiled boogey-man. The media further inflamed the anger and"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 10 hysteria of the nation with the overkill barrage of graphic images of the collisions and the collapses, with constant commentary of the massive numbers of deaths and injured and the psychological effects of the traumatizing on the children. The cumulative effect was as if a psychological eight-pound sledgehammer were swung to the gut. The President, after the horror had fully set into the American consciousness, (and his conspicuously, or suspiciously, late getaway after delaying a proper response while continuing on with a pre-scheduled school book reading photo-op), made his late press announcement with the confused and terrified masses of America fully prepared and conditioned to expect the blame to be laid at the feet of shadowy Muslim terrorists due to the media’s helpful reminders of previous terrorist attacks upon American interests with the 1983 Marine barracks bombing in Beirut, the 1985 hijackings of TWA- 847 airline and the Achille Lauro cruise ship, the 1993 World Trade Center bombing by Muslim radicals, the 1998 African Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, the 1995 Saudi Arabian Khobar Towers bombing, and the 2000 USS Cole attack, delivered the prepared script to blame for the attacks on Osama bin Laden and the Al Qaeda terror network. The media obligingly had the prepared the necessary supporting historical photo and video documentation and the parade of retired generals and other military, security, and terrorism “experts” to discuss the attacks and they too confirmed the methodology and motivation of terrorist organizations such as Al Qaeda. Within hours, the FBI, who heretofore had been unable to track or intercepting the attacks, was conveniently trotting out a list, including photographs, of 19 hijackers. The convergence of all these elements with the ingrained trust in the government, whether real or misplaced, created a powerful reality consensus. It was a grand exercise by the oligopoly media in manipulating the emotions of the shocked American consciousness. Prior to 9/11, terrorism in America was something that, excepting some homegrown varieties such as Timothy McVeigh and the Unabomber Ted Kaczynski, happened “over there.” In the interconnected"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 11 technological realization of the “global village” envisioned by Marshall McLuhan, the media event of 9/11 played out before the cameras, and by extension, the eyes of the world. The media became the message. The impact of the event justifiably compares to the psyops effect of the widespread fear, panic, and trauma that was created [and intended] by the Mercury Theater production of the 1938 Halloween evening radio simulation-broadcast of H.G. Wells’ War of the Worlds . The world had just changed right before our eyes in the most grotesque and abominable manner, the proper emotions are still indescribable, but no one who witnessed the events on 9/11 will forget them. The collective conscience of the American people was filled a righteous anger, rage, and yes, even murderous revenge. America developed a war psychosis and through it we would have our revenge. It was quite properly described by both President George W. Bush and Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger as the new Pearl Harbor of the 21st Century. 3 How many times have we watched a big name magician and they amazed us with their fantastic illusions and slight of hand tricks? Who can remember when renowned magician and illusionist David Copperfield made the Statue of Liberty disappear before a live audience during a broadcast special? How many times have we been amazed by the hyper-realism of Hollywood special effects on the movie screen, particularly scenes of massive destruction, and then even cheered at them? In a magic show, it’s all accomplished with a professional execution of sleight-of-hand, secret knowledge of lighting and visual angles, optic trickery, and clever misdirection; in Hollywood movie special effects it is enabled by the magic of suspension of disbelief, high powered computer graphics, emotion-stirring background music, and masterful acting; in the realms of politics and warfare, it’s the blitzkrieg of propaganda “shock and awe,” misinformation, carefully crafted strategic media campaigns, sloganeering, jingoism, and talking points, Swift-boat style foaming-at-the-mouth smearing and professional mouthpiece character assassins and “expert” think-tank hit teams, “sexed up” intelligence dossiers, and sophisticated psyops and propaganda machines: "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 12 ...you don't have anything to worry about -- third time I've said that. I'll probably say it three more times. See, in my line of work you got to keep repeating things over and over and over again for the truth to sink in, to kind of...catapult the propaganda. ~ President George W. Bush 4 The following information presented in this book, when viewed with an open and a mind detached from the emotions of the attacks, will attempt to shake your worldview to the core with its major and staggering implications. You are likely to get very angry. That is good and it is very necessary. This republic fought and broke free from the tyranny of the colonial rule of Britain on the basis of anger and resentment, and it can be recovered by it as well. Until a few months ago, I was, like probably many of you, oblivious to what was going on around me other than what was directly in front of me and only concerned about affairs five minutes into the future. I encourage you to research further, fact-check, and check deeper into what I have put together from a variety of websites and resources. Don’t take my word or research for it, check it out for yourself. If you apply the highest levels of doubt and scrutiny to what I have written in the following pages, I would genuinely hope and ask that you equally apply the same level of distrust and doubt about what the government claims in regards to 9/11. This information is very challenging, critically urgent material, and it is nothing less than earth-shattering. Everything I discuss in this paper is documented from mainstream media and accredited news organizations. Any unfamiliar term can be entered into a Google 5 search string for deeper study. The arguments I present are put forward in the spirit of an honest search for the truth, and not to insult or disparage the lives of those lost – murdered, from the attacks - or to offend their survivors. If the tone in this paper offends some, I sincerely apologize in advance. It is most definitely not intended to be condescending or derisive, I don’t have all the answers, but I do know something is amiss. Some may construe my comments as blunt, direct, harsh, and alarmist. My response is that we are all adults, and the time for tip-toeing around and sugar-coating the truth is long past us. If a literary slap across the face is needed to wake people out of the haze, then let it be done in the search for truth."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 13 In the past, the guard on the watch-tower, a very responsible duty, was expected to be loud so that the alarm could be heard. The duty of the tower guard was so sacred and pivotally important that the U.S. Marine Corps 11 General Orders is dominated with instructions for sentries. 6 This book is supported with over thirty-four pages of evidentiary citations from a wide range of sources, primarily from mainstream media, but also from alternative media, think-tank policy papers, and official government documents. Until almost a year ago, I was exactly where you are now, beguiled, uninformed, and misled. With such little time as I have in this presentation, I am trying to reach out and grab you by the collar and point you to the truth as I, and many others have discovered. A rapid learning curve is required and attempted here to overcome the nearly four years of government misinformation regarding 9/11 and the natural resistance to world changing ideas. What once was intended to be a small handout pamphlet has grown to encompass this book. There is that much to tell, and more. The Thesis. A prima facie case exists with credible witnesses, confessions, forensic analysis, and a compelling motive that the deliberate and planned mass-murder on 9/11 of over 3000 innocent U.S. citizens and foreigners on United Airlines Flights 175 and 93, American Airlines Flights 77 and 11, the World Trade Center (WTC) 1 & 2 building strikes and collapses, and upon the Pentagon, was planned and executed by an internal cancer, a festering and rotting gangrene, a collection of ruthless, mafia-like criminal elements within the U.S. government and within the military. Fundamentalist Arab hijackers likely had no operation role in the attacks other than as patsies, dupes, or useful idiots. The tally of the murdered dead does not include the 2100+ estimated U.S. troop deaths, 7 19,000+ casualties, and the combined estimate of 2-3 million Iraqi and Afghani deaths from the wars that resulted from the 9/11 attacks, as well as the passing of draconian laws such as the Patriot Act, 8 the Real ID Act, and several other laws designed to curtail individual liberties and freedoms. It is an undeniable fact that every law, every major government and intelligence realignment, and the massive growth of intrusive government passed since 9/11, the illegal resource wars in Afghanistan"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 14 and Iraq, have had as their fundamental justification and under-pinning, the government deception of 9/11. 9 The rally cry, the emotional trigger word for the mind controlled masses, the official mantra of the government has been the cult- like repetition of 9/11 as if this gives carte blanche for all the injustices of war crimes, torture, the rape of resources, perpetrated by the United States upon Iraq, Afghanistan, and even upon ourselves in the form of the rolling out of the creeping police state and the usurpation of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. How many times have you heard or read of some Brinks or Loomis armored truck being robbed in a daring heist? Who are the usual first immediate suspects that police interrogate and polygraph? Cons ider common computer hacking crimes, highway cargo shipping, shipyard dock thefts, or railroad freight theft, how are these types of crimes predominately orchestrated and who is usually involved? When a string of arsons are committed, who is often, to the public’s dismay, discovered to be the culprit? A trusted firefighter occasionally is involved. 10 In many instances, criminals will go into law enforcement careers to be able to do their dirty deeds with the perfect cover, and the color, of the law. The criminals get closer to their victims and hide behind their authority and the natural trust of the public, the wolf in sheep’s clothing. What is the usual modus operandi on the crime? Now massively scale the severity of the crime many magnitudes upwards to the realm of professional white-collar crime, embezzlement and money laundering, insider-trading, creative “pump-and-dump” stock investment schemes, for example: the $150 billion Savings and Loan scandals in the 1980’s, the $83 billion fraud and bankruptcy of Enron, the Harkin Energy debt-swap Scandal, the 2003 Fannie Mae under-reporting accounting scandal; the Tyco International theft of $600 million, the $3 billion missing and $12 billion in inflated assets from WorldCom (MCI), criminal scandal ad infinitum . 11 Nine times out of ten, it’s an inside job. The U.S. legal system has a seemingly endless multitude of federal and state laws on the books in such areas as: anti-trust and monopolies, racketeering, price-"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 15 fixing, predatory behavior, and insider trading, to even such relatively minor laws such as exploitation of the elderly and those of diminished mental capacity. The very language of criminal indictments and the basic presumptive nature of these laws and their justification for the punishment of these crimes is that by definition, conspirators and conspiracies exist. Even if the crime is not actually committed, individuals or groups of people can be charged for the mere planning of it, i.e. the conspiracy to commit [fill in the blank] charge. Throughout recorded history, and even in myths and legends, conspiracies of various degrees of magnitude and complexity have existed to subvert, exploit, or disadvantage society or individuals in one form or fashion. Are we to believe that the conference rooms of business or in the criminal underworld are the only realms where conspiratorial planning can occur? Of course not, to attempt to argue otherwise is pure delusion or denial. The realm of politics and military planning are not excluded from the scandal of betrayal, double-cross, intrigue, and the “inside job.” The classic American imagery of corrupt political machines, lists of the dead casting votes, racially motivated voting district gerrymandering, smoke-filled backrooms and arm-twisting deals to subvert the political process, trading votes, bribery and other political subterfuge are well established in political history for a genuine reason. Using deception and misdirection is central to military doctrines. Military strategist and general, Karl von Clausewitz states the axiom: “War is the continuation of politics by other means.” Common to all modern military operations is the principle of deception, counter-intelligence, feints, and disinformation. A magnificent example of military deception was Operation Fortitude and specifically Operation Quicksilver by General George S. Patton leading the largely fictional First United States Army Group in World War Two prior to the Normandy invasion, complete with inflatable tanks and artillery pieces. Sun Tsu, an influential ancient Chinese military strategist writes also in his famous treatise The Art of War : “All warfare is based on deception...O divine art of subtlety and secrecy! Through you we learn to be invisible, through you"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 16 inaudible, and hence we can hold the enemy’s fate in our hands.” False flag 12 operations are actively going on even in Iraq with the recent disclosure of British SAS troops caught posing as insurgents with disguises and terrorist equipment, weapons, and bombs attempting to sow seeds of unrest and violence with terror attacks on local populations and legitimate Iraqi police. 13 This is clear and convincing evidence of governments acting to create crisis situations to perpetuate the justification for their continued presence. Governments such as the United Kingdom and the United States are using, and have used, elite special forces to create order out of chaos. Even more surprising is the failure of the mainstream press and electronic media to expose the cover, or to intentionally ignore, these obvious and intentional government efforts to sabotage of their own stated intentions of providing security and stability in Iraq. The reporters officially sanctioned in Iraq are called “embedded journalists,” perhaps they are named that for a subtle reason. In the world of political “dirty tricks,” politicians and others with any meaningful power or influence are often compromised and pocketed for potential future use by the controlling interests by being filmed in bed by some agency with a male or female prostitute, someone other than their spouses – caught in flagrante delicto , framed in some other deviant sexual predilection, bribed, caught in crime, or some of the other known methods of compromising an individual. It seems apparent that independent journalists, unembedded, are often the targets of U.S. tank rounds in their hotels, especially after giving unfavorable reports. 14 That is a very effective way of gaining, if not favorable coverage, then silence – threaten them with being targeted, accidentally of course. The message is clear, play along to get along, or we’ll exclude you from news coverage or at worse, we’ll shoot at you. Cui bono is a Latin adage coined by the Roman statesman, dramatist, and philosopher Seneca and is used in basic criminal investigation. It means that one should begin the search for the culprit from among those that have the most to gain from a crime. Who benefited after 9/11? Who gets more funding? Who gets"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 17 more layers of control over our lives? Did the Arab countries such as Afghanistan or Iraq benefit? Did Saddam Hussein benefit? Did Al Qaeda benefit? When the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia were bombed in 1996 and blamed on Hezbollah and also possibly on Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden in the 2004 9/11 Commission Report, who got the reconstruction contract? Bin Laden Construction did. Did the Bush/Saudi family bin Laden Construction benefit from U.S. rebuilding contracts? Did any of those entities make billions in no-bid contracts, billions in contracts for the new Trans-Afghanistan Pipeline in Afghanistan, billions for un-metered oil sales, billions for reconstruction contracts in Iraq, billions in arms and weapons sales and R&D, the replanting of poppy fields in Northern Afghanistan and resulting increase in heroin production and money laundering, massive military base building contracts, billions received (and also saved from actual standard demolition costs) in the massive insurance payoffs from the World Trade Center complex? All it cost was a few thousand lives on 9/11 and few of our cherished liberties supposedly guaranteed as inalienable in the Constitution. But it’s just business. On a profit and loss sheet, it was masterful stroke of diabolical business acumen. For a couple of hundred thousand dollars in operational expenses, the World Trade Center was demolished in little over an hour at a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost estimated to dismantle it using traditional – and legal - building and demolition methods. In fact, the operational expenses of the attacks were very probably recovered from manipulation of the stock market through specifically targeted put option trading and speculation. On just a purely operational measure of success, the plan to bring down the WTC and plunge the nation into a course of aggressive militarism while simultaneously ushering in the Patriot Act was diabolically brilliant. Hardly rising to the level of work of Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden sequestered in a remote cave in Afghanistan. After reading this presentation, you may ultimately come to the conclusion(s) that I painfully have. Do not be afraid. Do not be disillusioned. You must remove the blinders that were forced upon you to keep you in the darkness and join the growing chorus of citizen-patriots calling for nothing less than: treason charges,"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 18 indictments for high crimes and misdemeanors, 15 and impeachment for the current occupant of the office of the Presidency and members of his administration, and possibly several prior administrations, and the reestablishment of Constitutional government. A massive scandal, cover-up, and Constitutional crisis exists in secret that dwarfs the shame of Nixon and the Watergate scandal. And it is probably only going to get worse before it gets better. We have been told the terrorists attacked the U.S. because they hate our freedoms. President Bush stated in his address before the Joint Session of Congress House and the American people: Americans are asking, why do they hate us? They hate what we see right here in this chamber -- a democratically elected government. Their leaders are self- appointed. They hate our freedoms -- our freedom of religion, our freedom of speech, our freedom to vote and assemble and disagree with each other. 16 But why are we told in complete Doublespeak contradiction that we must give up out liberties, our inalienable rights, here in order to be safe? Why has every one of the freedoms President Bush outlined been systematically eroded or set aside? More importantly, why have we allowed it? The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. ~ Thomas Jefferson Single acts of tyranny may be ascribed to the accidental opinion of a day, but a series of oppressions, begun at a distinguished period, unalterable through every change of ministers, too plainly prove a deliberate, systematic plan of reducing us to slavery ~ Thomas Jefferson Government is not reason; it is not eloquence; it is force!

If it happens, you can bet it was planned that way ~ Franklin D. Roosevelt You might be saying to yourself that the benevolent U.S. government would never do anything so horrible as to conspire and execute staged attacks upon its own citizens. You are probably thinking this is all ridiculous, the paranoid delusions of some moonbat conspiracy theorist. Such understandably incendiary discussions are usually sidestepped or ridiculed by shilled government media mouthpieces with comments such as: “that is beyond the pale,” “revisionist,” or even countered directly, and with the air of national authority. As if almost anticipating the onslaught of doubts and challenges to the ‘official version’ of 9/11, with an attempt to issue a preemptive deflection, President Bush equated conspiracy theories as promoting terrorism when he spoke before the United Nations on November 10th, 2001: We must speak the truth about terror. Let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the attacks of September the 11th, malicious lies that attempt to shift the blame away from the terrorists themselves, away from the guilty. To inflame ethnic hatred is to advance the cause of terror. 1 “The [President] doth protest too much, methinks.” 2 The President has now equated people advancing “conspiracy theories” as terrorists, enemies of the State, who advance the cause of terror. It is now taboo and risking appearing anti-American to suggest any other hypothesis than the “official theory.” What about the government’s own conspiracy theory? What makes it not outrageous? How can the President even make that claim only one month after the attacks, and before any investigation has been done by FEMA or even before the 9/11 Commission is even empanelled? Is any other 9/11 theory besides the government theory of intelligence failures and a fire based theory of collapse considered outrageous, even if it can be proven that alternative theories, even one’s as brazenly controversial as controlled demolition, can be proven? Governments throughout history have routinely conspired and acted with malice"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 22 towards their own blinded and self-absorbed populations. Don’t be too surprised, or so na ï ve. The truth is stranger than fiction. Consider these following examples from history that you likely haven’t been taught or exposed to of how elements within government routinely conspire to deceive, manipulate, and even to act with sinister intent to inflict violence, fear, repression, and war against its citizens. Governments have always used the threat of the stick, or the bullet, to prod the unwilling population into an unpopular direction, or when the public lacked the political will to pursue a course of action that their elite rulers chose for them, for better or for ill. The Government Diagnosed as Psychopathic . This list of examples from history of government’s callously abusing or deceiving its own citizens is necessarily lengthy to illustrate the wide range of activities and devious measures that the government, and in the focus of this discussion primarily, the U.S. government, will attempt. If we were to examine the strange and repetitive behavior and actions of the government – or more properly the people holding the reins, as we would a single person, how would we objectively evaluate it? It would be necessary to establish a pattern, a case history, in the government’s behavior to conclude a diagnosis. Most psychiatrists and behavioral psychologists, in my layman’s estimation, would characterize the following listed behavior as consistent with criminal psychopathy. 3 In diagnosing patients with anti-social or psychopathic behavior, it is widely accepted that if the examined person satisfies at least three of the conditions, the diagnosis for psychopathic mental illness is accepted. From the criteria of the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV Personality Disorder Diagnosis, 4 it can be reasonable determined from observation that the government’s action and behavior satisfy at least five of the professionally accepted measures for psychopathic behavior, including: 1.) Failure to conform to societal norms; 2) Deceitfulness and manipulativeness; 3) Reckless disregard for the safety of self or others; 4) Irritability and aggressiveness; 5) Lack of remorse after having hurt, mistreated, or stolen from"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 23 1933 Reichsta g Fire another person. The government is therefore being operated as if it were a psychopath; there can be no other reasonable conclusion. As you proceed through the list of examples of the government’s actions please keep the DSM-IV criteria in mind and question if the conduct of the government satisfies sufficiently the psychiatric standard. It would be interesting to have a FBI professional profiler examine the behavior and deliver a criminal profile. Who were some other famous psychopaths? Ted Bundy, the Zodiac Killer, John Wayne Gacy Jr., Jeffrey Dahmer, Charles Manson, Jim Jones of the People’s Temple in Jonestown, David Berkowitz aka the Son of Sam, Richard Ramirez aka the Night Stalker, Denis Rader aka the BTK Killer, Albert DeSalvo aka the Boston Strangler. All of these psychopaths were famous serial killers and fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria. Is there a common thread, a pattern? By the end of this book the truth will be brutally obvious. Think about that seriously for a moment, the codes to the nation’s nuclear arsenals are conceivably, and most likely, in the hands of psychopaths. What follows also is a version of history far removed, some might say intentionally, from the accepted orthodoxy of mainstream curricula in the state- run Ritalin dosing and indoctrination centers (schools), and from the public consciousness. As Orwell taught, “He who controls the past, controls the present and future.” It’s time to slip the chains of that control. The Reichstag Fire and the Gleiwitz Incident . This example from pre-WW2 Germany is included as a template for the bait-and-switch false-flag operation and the classic application of the Hegelian dialectic, thesis, antithesis, synthesis, or in modern language, Problem- Reaction-Solution. 5 In Germany, on February 27, 1933 the Weimar Republic’s legislative assembly building, known as the Reichstag, was firebombed and set ablaze by Marinus van der Lubbe, a mentally ill Dutch"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 24 Communist agitator. Hitler’s Nazi party Brownshirt’s and SS Stormtrooper’s may have also assisted in spreading the fire with gasoline to further engulf the building. Hitler and Hermann Göring soon arrived and upon seeing Lubbe, quickly blamed the fire on Communists and the Jews, and then convinced the aging and largely ceremonial president Paul von Hindenberg, to sign the Reichstag fire decree, which eliminated the human rights protections of the Weimar Constitution. Hitler proclaimed in an address: “You are now witnessing the beginning of a great epoch in German history...This fire is the beginning.” 4,000+ blameless Communists and Jews were arrested from stolen political lists and scapegoated; many executed or sent to prison camps that foreshadowed the coming Holocaust. 6 Show-trials followed the nation-wide hysteria, and as a result of the false terror, the Enabling Act (paralleling the Patriot Act) was authorized and Hitler was then legally empowered as Führer, rising to dictatorial power through a perversion and manipulation of the democratic process by using fear as a political device and ally. The Night of the Long Knives came next and many of the Nazi Party’s former supporters, the useful idiot’s, dupes, and many of the SA Brownshirt’s were executed, purged, or imprisoned, as well as other many political opponents and potential rivals. It has been said before that “all revolutions eat their own young.” The Gleiwitz incident was a staged pretext attack committed by Germany upon itself to blame Poland for an attack on a radio station along the Polish-German border on the night of Aug. 31, 1939. The SS officers seized the radio station in Polish military garb and proclaimed over the airwaves: \"People of Poland, the time has come for war between Poland and Germany!\" A German prison camp inmate named Francis Honiok was given a lethal injection and then shot, positioned at"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 25 the radio station wearing a Polish military uniform and presented as proof to the media that Poland and Polish insurgents were responsible for the attack. Twenty- one other attacks, collectively named Operation Himmler, named after the commander of the Schutzstaffel, the SS, Heinrich Himmler, were staged along the border to bolster the Nazi claims. Prior to the staged event, Goebbel’s propaganda machine went into overdrive churning out and spinning reports of Polish atrocities on ethnic Germans residing in Poland, to inflame the public. Hitler stated the theory of the Big Lie about the operation: \"I shall give a propagandist reason for starting the war. Never mind whether it is plausible or not. The victor will not be asked afterward whether he told the truth or not. In starting and waging a war it is not right that matters but victory.\" 7 The Deceit and Treason at Pearl Harbor . President Franklin D. Roosevelt committed treason against America and her loyal military forces by allowing the massive Imperial Japanese Navy air attack on December 7 th to proceed unimpeded to bring the U.S. into the war in Europe from the exploitation of the expected national outrage. According to the recently declassified October 1940 McCollum memo, 8 which was an 8-step plan to force or entice the Japanese to attack the US by using an oil embargo against the Japanese, military provocations in China, deploying U.S. warships in Japan’s territorial waters, and a collaborating embargo enforced by the British. 9 The Japanese, by having their oil supply cut off and their economy throttled by the embargoes of the U.S. and Britain, were effectively backed into a corner. To further add fuel to the fire, in July 1941, the U.S. government froze all Japanese assets and finances located in the U.S. 10 The U.S. military had also successfully cracked the Japanese military and diplomatic codes (Japanese Navy JN-25, MAGIC and PURPLE) with a high degree of success, 11 and were able intercept and decipher the transmissions of diplomatic and military plans. 12 In his meticulously researched book, Day of Deceit , Robert B. Stinnett states: \"Seven"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 26 Japanese naval broadcasts intercepted between Nov. 28 and Dec. 6 confirmed that Japan intended to start the war and that it would begin at Pearl Harbor.\" 13 The top secret radio stations at Hawaii, know as Station H, intercepted 129 radio communications from November 15 and December 6. One of the messages intercepted and decoded was from Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto himself: The task force, keeping its movement strictly secret and maintaining close guard against submarines and aircraft, shall advance into Hawaiian waters, and upon the very opening of hostilities shall attack the main force of the United States fleet in Hawaii and deal it a mortal blow. 14 The Honolulu Advisor on November 30, 1941 headlined a story “JAPANESE MAY STRIKE OVER WEEKEND,” 15 yet the Navy at Pearl Harbor, in the largest concentration of U.S. military power in the Pacific, was in a relaxed demeanor, in an actual “stand-down.” The U.S. Chief of Naval Operations issued, on the basis of an intercepted coded message of the Japanese intent of war, orders to allow U.S. unrestricted submarine and air warfare against Japanese forces, yet the battleship fleet remained asleep and unaware at anchor. 16 As early as 0342 on December 7, Japanese 2-man midget submarine periscopes were detected off Honolulu Harbor and at 0445 Japanese midget submarines were detected by minesweepers and engaged by the destroyer USS Ward 17 nearly three hours before the Japanese Navy surprise air attack on Pearl Harbor naval bases and army air bases, yet the military remained in a “stand down” posture at Pearl Harbor. 18 All this hostile activity, the early radar detection of the incoming attacking wave of Japanese fighters, torpedo, and high altitude bombers, yet the military was in “stand down.” Roosevelt allowed the Dec. 7 attack to proceed unimpeded resulting in 2400 U.S. deaths and heavy damage to the anchored battleship fleet. Coincidentally, or perhaps with strategic foresight, the most modern of the U.S. fleet, the aircraft carriers, were ordered away from Hawaii just prior to the attacks, leaving only the older and obsolete"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 27 battleships and cruisers remaining anchored to receive the brunt of the Japanese attack. The older WW1-era battleships and cruisers were anchored in neat rows and the aircraft lined nose to nose at the Army airfields, making them ripe targets for the picking. Roosevelt desired to bring the U.S. into the war to fight the Germans in Europe, knowing that the mutual defense treaties between Japan and Germany would provide the perfect justification, and the resulting outrage of Pearl Harbor would force the U.S. to enter the war. That America was going to war was decided long before the Pearl Harbor attacks, Roosevelt campaigned on a platform of isolationism and staying out of the European conflict, but was using backchannels to provoke a war with Japan, what was needed was the trigger mechanism. Writing in 1938, a full three years before the Pearl Harbor sneak attack, a British propagandist, Captain Sidney Rogerson presciently wrote of a familiar sounding sales pitch: To persuade her [the United States] to take our part will be much more difficult, so difficult as to be unlikely to succeed. It will need a definite threat to America, a threat, moreover, which will have to be brought home by propaganda to every citizen, before the republic will again take arms in an external quarrel...“The position will naturally be considerably eased if Japan were involved, and this might and probably would bring America in without further ado. At any rate, it would be a natural and obvious effect of our propagandists to achieve this, just as in the Great War they succeeded in embroi ling the United States with Germany. “Fortunately with America, our propaganda is on firm ground. We can be entirely sincere, as our main plank will be the old democratic one. We must clearly enunciate our belief in the democratic form of government, and our firm resolve to adhere to...the old goddess of democracy routine. 19 The Atomic Soldiers. Operations Tumbler- Snapper, Plumbbob, Upshot-Knothole, Buster-Jangle, and several others, were among a series of 1940-1960’s Cold-War atmospheric atomic bomb experiments beginning with the July 1941 Trinity test blast at the Alamogordo range in New Mexico. Over the series of atmospheric tests, tens of thousands of U.S. soldiers,"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 28 sailors, airmen, and cleanup crews took to the testing grounds and conducted drills and maneuvers just after atomic devices were exploded, and were exposed to high levels of ionizing radiation at testing ranges in the Pacific and also in New Mexico and Nevada. Support personnel and clean up crews were also overexposed to ionizing radiation from the detonation sites. Defense Department films from the era show soldiers with no protective gear and no gas masks being brushed off of fallout with common straw brooms. Other films show the troops within the shadow of the atomic mushroom cloud still rising in their very near vicinity, as well as being swept with fallout dust from the blast waves. The atomic tests conducted with U.S. military personnel were larger in explosive yield and also in emitted radiation than the two atomic weapons dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Personal radiation exposure badges were primitive and imprecise and are now presumed to have led to overexposures. 20 The soldiers and airmen flew testing and sampling aircraft, marched, and conducted simulated combat operations among the fallout and worked within the radioactive area of ground zero, without protective clothing or respiratory devices. Several blasts were conducted that exposed soldiers and airmen to heavy doses of dangerous ionizing radiation with the purpose of conditioning U.S. troops to the false security of atomic combat. After many decades of illnesses and cancer related deaths, these soldiers have yet to be fully compensated for their injuries. 21 Disabled American Veterans National Commander Michael E. Dobmeier says: ''Veterans exposed to ionizing radiation suffer debilitating illnesses and disabilities but are treated as second- class citizens by the federal government.” 22 These faithful soldiers were abandoned by their government to fend for themselves and to suffer in silence. Is it anti-patriotic to point out these injustices and oversights? General George Washington, in the brutal winter of 1777, himself penned several unflattering and angry letters to the Continental Congress over the poor supply, morale of his troops, the lack of food, shoes, pay, and other basic necessities for"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 29 his desperately under-provisioned troops from his winter encampment at Valley Forge. He lambasted and condemned the Continental Congress for their thrifty and laissez-faire attitude towards fighting the conflict. Was he a traitor? Was he anti-patriotic? Did he aggravate the already hungry and demoralized troops under his command by his exhortations and admonishments to the warmly housed and well-fed politician’s content to let others do the fighting with little or no compensation and poor lack of provision? No, of course he did not. The Gulf of Tonkin and the Vietnam War . The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was a product of another series of U.S. provocations and deliberate deceptions. On August 2, 1964 U.S. naval forces were performing aggressive joint CIA and South Vietnamese surveillance and covert hit-and-run guerilla military operations, (such as bombing radar installations and bridges against North Vietnam under the auspices of Operation Plan 34A), when they were intercepted and attacked by North Vietnamese patrol boats. The captain of the destroyer/surveillance ship USS Maddox , John J. Herrick, indicated that he believed his ship was an active participant in the covert 34A operations. 23 The response from North Vietnam on August 2nd was far from an unprovoked attack, nor unexpected for attacks that could be argued already were acts of war by the United States, and without the knowledge and consent of the Congress. Johnson also acknowledged the covert operations against North Vietnam when he stated: “There have been some covert operations in that (Tonkin Gulf) area that we have been carrying on - blowing up some bridges and things of that kind, roads and so forth. So I imagine (the North Vietnamese) wanted to put a stop to it.” 24 Additionally, further substantive and credible evidence exists that the “attacks” of August 4th on the Maddox were either faked, non-existent, or over- exaggerated. 25 Archived audio tapes released by the Johnson Presidential Library call into question the veracity of the claims that North Vietnamese ever attacked"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 30 the Maddox on August 4th. The night was stormy, blustery and visibility was scant to nil. The seas were not calm, and regional tensions were already high due to the 34A operations. The reports from Maddox indicated that two unidentified vessels approached and launched 20 torpedoes at the ship. The U.S. destroyers responded to two ambiguous and unidentified radar blips with heavy and sustained fire of 5-inch guns, 3-inch guns, and also depth charges. Subsequent reports that day from Admiral Grant Shar p, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet informed the Joints Chiefs that “many of the reported contacts and torpedoes fired appear “doubtful,” and blamed the initial reports on “overeager sonar men” and “freak weather effects on radar.” 26 Captain John J. Herrick cabled the Pentagon with a FLASH (extremely urgent) message and reported that there were “no actual visual sightings [of North Vietnamese ships] by Maddox . Suggest complete evaluation before any further action taken.” 27 That flash communication was received by McNamara and the Pentagon approximately an hour before the President interrupted national television. Other statements on the tapes indicated a qualified reservation about the reliability of the attacks, with messages from Admiral Sharp in response to a question from Air Force Lt. General Burchinal of the JCS such as: “You’re pretty sure there was a torpedo attack? No doubt about that, I think.” 28 I think? Further calling into dispute the ‘official story’ is the statement given by squadron commander James Stockdale, one of the U.S. naval aviators flying air cover overhead August 4. In the 1990’s, Admiral Stockdale, a seven year “Hanoi Hilton” POW survivor who endured horrible tortures and was a recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor recollected: “I had the best seat in the house to watch that event, and our destroyers were just shooting at phantom targets -- there were no PT boats there. There was nothing there but black water and American fire power.” 29 President Johnson admitted a year later his uncertainty as to whether the North Vietnamese patrol boats ever attacked the U.S initially. Johnson said in 1965: “For all I know, our Navy was shooting at whale’s out there.” 30 The entire incident was a ruse, a manufactured fabrication and distortion of the truth,"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 31 however, President Johnson went before the American people interrupting broadcast television and announced the attacks as genuine, despite having been advised just half an hour before the national broadcast that there were substantial doubts as to the Aug. 4th attacks with several contradictory statements and flimsy evidence. These “attacks” formed the justification for Johnson to brazenly request the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution. The Congress was implicitly threatened with being labeled anti-patriotic, they were stampeded into responding to Johnson’s live late-night televised announcement by delivering to the president a blank check authorizing the buildup of troops, previously and expeditiously termed “advisors,” and escalated the conflict. For the first time in American history, U.S. troops were engaged in a war without the formal constitutionally required declaration of war. Years later, additional recorded conversations between Johnson and McNamara emerged from the Johnson Library that indicated that Johnson was particularly angry at McNamara. In a secret recording Johnson berated Robert McNamara, his Defense Secretary, for misleading him. \"You said: 'Damn, they are launching an attack on us, they are firing on us.' When we got through with all the firing, we concluded maybe they hadn't fired at all.\" 31 These arrogant men, walking in counsel with no one but themselves and pre-committed to escalating the Vietnam beyond small low- intensity guerillas skirmishes, took the nation to war, and 58,000 servicemen to their deaths on scant and exaggerated evidence. With this fait accompli the Vietnam War began and was then waged and escalated through to the Nixon Administration. Numerous social repercussions followed, including the polarization of the country, demoralization, feminism and the decline of the traditional nuclear family, the sexual revolution, and the massive increase of drugs being imported into America. It was a goldmine and an open bank vault for the Military Industrial Complex in defense contracts, weapons development, and open testing on the battlefields and jungles of Vietnam. In total, the Vietnam War cost the needless sacrifice of 58,226 U.S. soldiers killed and 153,303 casualties suffered (and up to 1 million Vietnamese killed and injured). Those Americans that didn’t come home in a body bag were"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 32 physically and mentally maimed and still bear scars seen and unseen. In 1995, former Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara visited Hanoi, Vietnam and met with former adversary North Vietnamese General Vo Nguyen Giap. In that meeting Giap disclosed to McNamara the alleged second attack in the Gulf of Tonkin never occurred. McNamara states unequivocally that: \"I am prepared to say without a doubt there was no second attack.\" 32 Very recently in December 2005, after the release of numerous declassified intelligence documents, the National Security Agency’s in-house publication Cryptologic Quarterly , intelligence analyst and historian Robert J. Hanyok concludes that beyond doubt, “no attack happened that night... The parallels between the faulty intelligence on Tonkin Gulf and the manipulated intelligence used to justify the Iraq war make it all the more worthwhile to re-examine the events of August 1964 in light of new evidence” 33 This evidence of was also purposely withheld since 2001 to avoid embarrassment to the government and to prevent comparison to the Iraq war run-up intelligence. 34 Matthew Aid, a research assistant to Haynok, claimed that “This material is relevant to debates we as Americans are having about the war in Iraq and intelligence reform...To keep it classified simply because it might embarrass the agency is wrong.” 35 Vietnam and Agent Orange . The another horrible consequence of the Vietnam War was the introduction of the heavy use of chemical defoliants, herbicides, and dioxin toxins in the massive spraying campaigns of Operation Ranch Hand . Originally using weapons such as napalm and white phosphorus, chemical defoliants and herbicides were used to eliminate the thick triple canopy jungle cover and hiding areas for the Viet Cong and the NVA regular and their supply lines, destroying millions of acres of jungle and also poisoning farmland and rice fields for years to come. Agent Orange, Agent Blue, Agent Purple, and Agent Pink, and others were manufactured by Monsanto and Dow Chemical, and their use in Spra y in g A g ent Oran g e defoliant in Vietnam"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 33 Vietnam resulted in the untold tens of thousands of birth defects and genetic damage to the Vietnamese, and also in a cruel twist of fate, also to U.S. soldiers and their children. Up to 2.4 million people were exposed to Agent Orange, so named after its orange stripe around 55 gallon barrels, and its various cumulative genetic damaging side effects 36 and cancers. 37 In all, during the Vietnam conflict, C-123 planes sprayed more than 19 million gallons of Agent Orange and other herbicides, leaving a horrible and long lasting legacy of poison and genetic deformities. 38 Seven years after the Vietnam War began, the Pentagon Papers 39 were leaked and it was revealed that the administration officials had begun drafts of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution two months prior to the confrontation in the Gulf of Tonkin. 40 This echo’s the rushed passing of the 2001 USA-Patriot Act, a 1000+ page law introduced and ramrodded through Congress just weeks after the 9/11 attacks, but it’s just a coincidence; go back to sleep. The Patriot Act, just like the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, was prepared months to years in advance and merely sat on some shelf awaiting the opportunistic triggering event to unveil it to a cowed population. The Tuskegee Syphilis Study 1932-1972 . For nearly 40 years, the U.S. government administered by the US Public Health Service in Macon County, Alabama, in secret the infamous and heinous syphilis experiments to track the disease’s painful progression from initial infection up to and including the death of many patients. The government intentionally left untreated a painful debilitating and fatal disease on 399 unwitting and uninformed poor blacks in Tuskegee, AL just to gain widely"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 34 Pro j ect Whitecoat known medical data. 41 The known and accepted treatment of penicillin was intentionally withheld from the largely poor and uneducated black men. Medical doctors, actually ghouls in lab coats, broke their Hippocratic Oath to do no harm to patients in a morbid curiosity and lied to their patients that they were treating them, when in fact they were mistreating them as experiment subjects without their informed consent. This is terribly reminiscent of the forced medical experimentation on concentration camp prisoners, including children, during WW2 by the grotesquely evil Nazi SS officer Dr. Joseph Mengele, the Auschwitz “Angel of Death.” President Clinton said in a public government apology to the surviving victims said: The United States government did something that was wrong - deeply, profoundly, and morally wrong. It was an outrage to our commitment to integrity and equality for all our citizens...clearly racist. ~ President Clinton's apology for the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment to the eight remaining survivors, May 16, 1997 U.S. Biological Weapons Experiments . The U.S. Government and military has conducted hundreds of biological experiments upon the unknowing public. 42 In 1966, the U.S. Army secretly released a limited biological attack of a live anthrax simulant organism bacillus subtilis variant niger into the New York subway system to measure its effectiveness and dispersal patterns. 43 More than a million civilians were unwittingly exposed when army scientists drop light bulbs filled with the live bacteria into ventilation grates. The government also released live bacillus globiggii secretly in May 1965 in the Washington National Airport and at its Greyhound Bus terminal. 44 From 1954 to 1973, the U.S. Army at USARMIID, Ft. Detrick, Maryland, conducted experiments in Project Whitecoat with live biological agents and vaccine testing on approximately 2300 religious conscientious objectors, exposing them to"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 35 biological agents such as Q-fever and tularemia for weapons and countermeasures development. 45 In 1950, the city of San Francisco was the target of tests of an aerosol cocktail of biological agents dispensed by ship-based foggers in the bay. 46 These secret experiments resulted in an outbreak in pneumonia and a rash of flu-like deaths and hospitalizations. Bubonic Plague, the medieval source of the Black Death which wiped out a third of the population of Europe, was released in the 1950’s near Scotland. 47 The U.S. military openly admits to 50 experiments conducted on U.S. troops from 1962 to 1973 involving nearly 5,900 servicemen. 48 Disclosed in September of 2005, three laboratory mice with strains of bubonic plague were reported missing from a Level 3 Hazard bioterrorism lab in New Jersey. 49 The mice were only reported to the press as missing after a two week delay. That is unacceptable negligence and incompetence. In 1958, the United States conducted experiments in Georgia and Florida with the release of swarms of specially bred mosquitoes to discover if the insects could be used as a delivery system for biological weapons agents. The mosquitoes deployed were the precise aedes aegypti mosquito that carries the dengue fever virus as well as other deadly or debilitating pathogens such as malaria, West Nile, and eastern equine encephalitis. Between May and October 1981, an epidemic of dengue fever spread through Cuba with 158 reported fatalities (101 children) and over 300,000 suffering from exposure. In 1967 it was reported by Science magazine that at the US government center in Fort Detrick, Maryland, dengue fever was amongst those \"diseases that are at least the objects of considerable research and that appear to be among those regarded as potential BW [biological warfare] agents.\" 50 Over 239 open-air tests were conducted by the U.S., of which 80 used live strains of biological agents and were released in or near U.S cities. 51 Some of the areas targeted included San Francisco, New York, Washington, D.C., Key West, Panama City, Minneapolis, and St. Louis. \"Release in and near cities, in real- world circumstances, were considered essential to the program, because the effect of a built-up area on a biological agent cloud was unknown,\" Edward A."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 36 Miller, the Army’s secretary for research and development testified before a Senate sub-committee in 1977. 52 In 1965, near the outskirts of the City of Stillwater, Oklahoma was the test-site of an experiment where the military deployed florescent particles of zinc cadmium sulfide. Cadmium is a known human health hazard, even in small amounts. No post-test monitoring of the population of Oklahoma was conducted and illnesses from exposure to concentrations of cadmium could have ranged from organ failure to cancer. 53 These types of air releases are still being conducted today, with the stated goals of determining drift patterns of chemicals or pathogens in U.S. cities in a mock attack. On August 8, 2005 New York City was the site of a drill testing several chemicals in a gas overseen by the Dept. of Homeland security under the operation name Urban Dispersion Project . 54 Given the military and government’s track record in these operations, it is wise to be skeptical of their stated intentions and have a watchdog mentality. On Sept. 24-25, 2005, biohazard sensors were triggered in Washington D.C., when small amounts of highly infectious tularemia were discovered 55 – coincidentally on the weekend of the largest mass protest against the Iraq War and against President George Bush, who also coincidentally was participating in a secret urban warfare and martial law drill called Granite Shadow. 56 Biological agents discovered during a protest march? Was somebody sending a veiled threat, a shot across the bow, to the protesters against further marches? It’s just a coincidence; nothing to worry about. In the fall of 2001, a series of attacks were sent through the U.S. postal system. The letters contained very dangerous and potentially lethal anthrax spores. These specially designed weaponized spores were of highest grade of military biological agents and were selectively sent to key U.S. Congressmen and Senators, as well as across the country, just coincidentally on the eve of passing the Patriot Act after 9/11. Anthrax bacteria"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 37 The source of this weaponized Ames -strain of anthrax was traced back to a U.S. military production facility and to date no one has been charged or tried as a result of the wave of attacks. 57 The anthrax infected envelopes to key members of Congress were a direct threat, with the clear message of “pass this legislation or else.” It is similar to the La Cosa Nostra mafia trademark tactic of leaving a newspaper-wrapped fish on someone’s doorstep as a warning. So, are you going to continue to believe that Al-Qaeda stole a batch or a sample of highly secure ultra-high grade weaponized anthrax from a U.S. military and biological weapons development facility? Are you going to believe that they then cooked up 20-30 kilograms of a high quality U.S. military created variant of weapons-grade anthrax in a cave, or in a suburban New Jersey garage, and just coincidentally mailed it out to arrive on the desk of Senate leaders just before voting on the Patriot Act? None of the anthrax envelopes were sent to President Bush nor to any members of the administration, who also surprisingly just so happened to be placed on the antibiotic Cipro the day of the 9/11 attacks, three weeks before any of the anthrax laced packages began arriving. 58 Cipro is the antibiotic treatment of choice for anthrax infections. After the Patriot Act was passed, the threat of anthrax attacks subsided considerably and has fallen off the radar of the media, the FBI, and more importantly, the sleeping herd of sheep in America. It’s all just a big coincidence, nothing to worry about, please go back about your business. Wake Up! Do you enjoy being conned? Do you enjoy having the government lies and frauds flaunted right in front of your face? They are laughing at you, at us. This isn’t just some bad used car sale and a crooked salesman; this is your rights under assault and your liberties at stake and they being systematically stripped away under the guise of providing security for a crisis they, these so-called protectors, create. This is the very definition of tyrannical rule. It is tyrannical rule in a velvet glove perhaps, but still tyrannical. "},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 38 U.S. Chemical Weapons Experiments . The U.S. Government and military conducted numerous and extensive nerve gas and chemical weapons tests on thousands of human subjects, for example: Project 112 , a series of tests named Devils Hole 1-3 , Big Tom, Rapid Tan 1-3 , and Project Shad (Shipboard Hazard and Defense). 59 The experiments under Project Shad 60 were performed covertly on uninformed and unprotected troops and sailors in the U.S. and also in the United Kingdom. 61 LSD, 62 VX 63 and sarin 64 nerve agents have also been used on troops to measure effects and exposure levels. 65 Sarin is a toxin that can trigger symptoms including difficulty breathing, nausea, violent body jerking, staggering, loss of bladder and bowel control, and death. VX nerve agents are usually an oily liquid that is tasteless and odorless and considered one of the most deadly agents ever made by man. With severe exposure to the skin or lungs, death usually occurs within 10 to 15 minutes. In the 1965, U.S. Army soldier Arnold Parks was selected for and administered what he believed was a new polio vaccine. In later years he learned it was the deadly nerve agent VX, sarin, and LSD. He states: And it states right in there on this date they gave me VX, on this date they gave me Sarin, on this date they gave me LSD,\" Parks said. \"I was angry. As a matter of fact, I came unglued. \"The VX they gave, it was a pill. And I asked the guy after I took that, you know, I asked him ‘what was that?’ He said, 'That’s the new pill for polio.' 66 When he was administered the doses on LSD, he related that he had acid “trips” that involved murderous hallucinations and dreams. It can be considered reasonably doubtful to assume that Parks was the only one subjected to these surreptitious and unethical experiments. The Veteran’s Administration refuses to give him compensation or acknowledge any link from his dosing to ailments and after effects he suffered. 67 Even with this limited disclosure by the military, it doesn’t necessarily bode well for full disclosure. U.S. Representative Christopher Shays says:"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 39 The fact that the military is investigating, it doesn't breed confidence. The military tends to downplay its involvement with radiation, with biological warfare and chemical warfare...The military does not have a very good record when it comes to examining itself. Its past record of candid review, it's just not there.\" 68 In other secret experiments, the chemical agent BZ, 69 a strong and long-term hallucinogenic and psychotropic agent related to scopolamine (a truth serum interrogation drug), was sprayed onto U.S. troops in Vietnam, Hawaii, and other locations. 70 The effects of BZ were known to last for weeks after exposure to the chemicals. Project Dork was conducted upon 362 unwitting subjects that were sprayed with BZ (quinuclidinyl benzilate), known as “agent buzz.” The movie Jacob’s Ladder depicted the effects from the spraying of the BZ mist upon the human test subjects with the result being hallucinating and disoriented troops engaging in friendly fire incidents. These tests were often done without full disclosure and informed consent, and even with outright deception. According to a report in 1994 prepared for the U.S. Senate Report Veteran’s Affairs Committee, “Is Military Research Hazardous to Veterans' Health? Lessons Spanning Half a Century:” Hundreds of soldiers were subjected to hallucinogens in experimental programs conducted by the DOD in participation with, or sponsored by, the CIA. These service-members often unwittingly participated as human subjects in tests for drugs intended for mind-control or behavior modification, often without their knowledge or consent. Although the ultimate goal of those experiments was to provide information that would help U.S. military and intelligence efforts, most Americans would agree that the use of soldiers as unwitting guinea pigs in experiments that were designed to harm them, at least temporarily, is not ethical. 71 In 1965, prisoners at the Holmesburg State Prison in Philadelphia, under the direction of V.K. Rowe of Dow Chemical and Dr. Albert Klingman, were subjected to dioxin, the highly toxic chemical component of Agent Orange used in Vietnam. 72 The men are later studied for development of cancer, which indicates that Agent Orange had been a suspected carcinogen all along. Under the direction"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 40 of Dow Chemical researchers, pure dioxin was applied to the skin of prisoners. The doctors at point even increased the dosage dramatically at one point in the study. According to Dow, these men developed chloracne but no other health problems. But no health records are available to confirm these findings, and no follow-up was done on the prisoners, even after several went to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) after they were released seeking help because they were sick. The EPA did not help them. The EPA “lost” their files, even though major testimony regarding the study came to light in 1980 EPA hearings where the supervising study doctor appeared. The result was that Dow could continue to maintain that the only observed side effects from the dioxin exposure were cases of severe acne, chloracne. In 1978, the Department of Defense decided to dispose of its remaining stockpiles of Agent Orange after it had determined there were no legitimate domestic uses for the chemical. Thousands of barrels left over from the war were burned at sea at Johnson Island, a pacific atoll. The EPA provided safety manuals to the crew of the incinerator ship Vulcanus. The EPA 1978 manual indicated: The highly toxic contaminant present in Herbicide Orange is 2,3,7,8- tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. The US Air Force has analyzed Herbicide Orange stocks and found TCDD concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 47 ppm [parts per million]. Times Beach was evacuated at 2 ppb—parts per billion. Pooled stocks would have an estimated average TCDD concentration of 1.9 ppm. The principal Herbicide Orange constituent of concern, TCDD, has been found to be highly embryotoxic, teratogenic (tending to cause developmental malfunctions and monstrosities,) and acnegenic and is lethal in the microgram-per-kilogram of body weight range. 73 If this weren't enough, the manual was put together with the cooperation of Dow Chemical's Rowe, who had been Dow's point man in telling all the customers that there were no problems with their herbicides while secretly writing to all Dow management that TCDD is \"the most toxic material we've ever studied.\" "},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 41 To certain uncaring, unsympathetic, and even malevolent elements within the government, our U.S. troops are nothing more than cannon-fodder, lab-monkeys, and guinea pigs. You know them by their fruits, not by their words. Wake Up! Secret Nuclear Experiments and Air Releases . The U.S. government conducted numerous secret experiments ranging from individual human testing (injecting uranium and plutonium - Dr. Harold Hodge and Rochester, NY University) 74 on unwitting subjects, to intentional atmospheric (beyond above ground atomic blasts) releases near or over cities and populated areas. 75 A recent report from U.S. scientists indicated that over 11,000 citizens were killed as a result of radioactive fallout from U.S. atmospheric nuclear testing. Another hidden source of radioactive releases is the admitted 32 “broken arrows” 76 of the U.S. military and also the several fires and accidents in atomic bomb manufacturing plants located around the U.S., such as the fire that broke out at the Rocky Flats plutonium trigger facility in 1957, near Denver and 600,000 people, that resulted in a massive release of highly toxic plutonium into the area. 77 In the words of Sue Roff, a radiation researcher, “It is a horrific legacy.” Another horrific example of ethical misconduct was Project Sunshine. This was a patently disgusting and evil program where 1000’s of dead children and stillborn were used in top-secret atomic and radiological experiments, unknown to their parents. This is horrible betrayal is nothing but government sanctioned infant grave-robbing. 78 In 1995, the New York Times printed an article about 9,000 Americans, many of them children, were subjects in 154 secret radiation exposure tests beginning in the 1940’s sponsored by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission with little concern to informed consent requirements for the patients. 79 Wake Up! The main reason for much of the horrific and unethical experimentation on human beings was the Cold-War race with the Soviet Union for the hydrogen bomb and the build-up of the American nuclear arsenal. In order to condition the public into accepting thermonuclear weapons as a legitimate military tool, and to allay the public fears of atmospheric testing and the now known resultant"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 42 spreading of dangerous radioactive fallout, studies with the pre-determined named outcome, such as Project Sunshine were implemented. In his exceptional work, Tragedy and Hope , historian and highly regarded mentor to President William Jefferson Clinton, (who Clinton specifically mentioned in his 1992 Democratic Acceptance Speech at the DNC) 80 Professor Carroll Quigley provides valuable insight: To prepare public opinion to accept use of the H-bomb, if it became necessary, Strauss sponsored a study of radioactive fallout whose conclusion was prejudged by calling it \"Project Sunshine.\" By selective release of some evidence and strict secrecy of other information, they tried to establish in public opinion that there was no real danger to anyone from nuclear fallout even in all-out nuclear war. This gave rise to controversy between the scientists and the Administration on the danger of fallout. 81 The CIA and Nazi’s, MK-ULTRA, and Mind Control Experiments . Even more disturbing is the admittedly extensive and Mengele- esque projects known as MK-ULTRA, 82 MK-SEARCH, MK- NAOMI, ARTICHOKE, Project MONARCH, 83 and Project BLUEBIRD 84 experiments for developing human mind- control, truth serums, effective torture/interrogation methods and countermeasures, Neuro-Linguistic programming, and brain-washing techniques by the CIA and the Army Chemical Corps. 85 The primary objective of these groups of projects was outlined in a memorandum dated January 1952 that ominously asked: \"Can we get control of an individual to the point where he will do our bidding against his will and even against fundamental laws of nature such as self preservation?\" 86 Commenting on this subject editorially in the New York Times: We are not sufficiently schooled in ethics to know how this differs from murder...'The means as well as the end were outrageous. It added that none know how many citizens were used as guinea pigs and how many were directly harmed. 87 "},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 43 Several of the barbaric and inhumane mind control experiments, predominately Project Monarch, involved child research subjects as young as 2-3 years old using extreme violence, sexual abuse and torture trauma- based creation of multiple personalities (Dissociative Identity Disorder), called “alters.” 88 Often, to complete the mental compartmentalization of the trauma event, painful electric shock was applied to the victim. The cumulative and overarching goal of these programs was to create human robotic “ Manchurian Candidate” assassins, spies, perfect soldiers, drug “mules,” and sexual blackmailers. The extreme abuse of trauma based mind control creates amnesiac barriers with each mentally walled off or compartmentalized segment having a distinct personality. Such alters could be manifested by predetermined “trigger” words, phrases, sounds, or gestures. Some Monarch survivors and deprogrammed individuals have come forward after having had their programming reversed and have successfully sued their abusers, called handlers. 89 Many of the research techniques utilized in the brainwashing regimen were direct descendents of the evil work done by Nazi medical scientists in the concentration camps under the supervision of Dr. Joseph Mengele. This macabre knowledge was obtained at the highest moral cost through the gruesome tortures and deaths of thousands of innocent victims, including infants and children. As well as the research, the recovered personnel included top scientists, the Nazi intelligence networks and crypto apparatus, and hundreds of other Nazi war-criminals, including the highest ranking SS officers, such as General Reinhard Gehlen, 90 and Gestapo officers, and they were clandestinely imported into the United States and into Latin America. The Nazi’s had their war records and dossiers whitewashed and given new identities under the Project Paperclip 91 and “ratline” programs. According to SS Gen. Reinhard Gehlen Nazi “super-spy”"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 44 the “official” government records, between 1945 and 1955, 765 scientists, engineers, intelligence, and were snuck into the country to support America’s Cold War effort, the most widely known area was in rocket and missile development for NASA 92 Many of these Nazi imports were described in the dossiers as “ardent” supporters of Nazi ideology even after the war, and it is not known if they ever renounced their Nazi beliefs. Among the most famous of the Paperclip appropriations was V-1 and V-2 rocket scientist Wernher von Braun, who eventually played the leading part in the developments of both the NASA space rockets and also the U.S. military ICBM programs. The Nazi “Vengeance” rockets, the primitive cruise missile V1 “buzz-bomb” and ballistic V2 rockets were used in 1944-1945, and launched from Peenemunde’s underground tunnels and construction facilities to terrorize Western Europe and Great Britain were von Braun’s designs. One of the greatest of untold stories is the collusion between American business interests and the Nazi regime. The Nazi’s that were rescued, recruited, and absorbed into the early U.S. intelligence agencies – that helped establish the CIA; 93 the same Nazi scientists that built the fantastic advanced weapons of WW2 and helped to build NASA, the same Nazi mind control specialists that perfected unethical human medical experimentation, saw their work expanded and continued under cloak and shadow in MK-ULTRA; the same Nazi’s that were ushered into power and had their WWI devastated economy rebuilt and depleted military forces rearmed to the teeth by wealthy war profiteers masquerading as industrialists (with common household names and corporations such as publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst, Andrew Mellon and Alcoa, General Motors and DuPont, Brown Brothers & Harriman, George Walker, Union Bank of New York, Prescott Bush, 94 Allen Dulles, Joseph Kennedy, International Telephone and Telegraph, the Rockefellers with Standard Oil had an extensive Pro j ect Paperclip von Braun Rocket team at Fort Bliss"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 45 relationship with German I.G.-Farben, Coca-Cola, IBM, and Ford Motor Co.) 95 found willing collaborators and financial patrons in the U.S industry and finance arena and specifically Wall Street interests before, during, and after WWII; 96 are the same Nazi’s that orchestrated the Reichstag fire, the same industrialists and financiers that were involved in the Business Plot of 1933 to stage a fascist coup of the U.S. government. They did not give up their philosophies just because they lost a war; they went underground, they found new hosts to incubate and spread their beliefs and practices. They also had deeply-pocketed super-rich financial backers. Some may argue that while the Germans lost WWII, the Nazi’s just relocated and switched sides. A clique of U.S. industrialists is hell-bent to bring a fascist state to supplant our democratic government and is working closely with the fascist regime in Germany and Italy. I have had plenty of opportunity in my post in Berlin to witness how close some of our American ruling families are to the Nazi regime. . . \"Certain American industrialists had a great deal to do with bringing fascist regimes into being in both Germany and Italy. They extended aid to help Fascism occupy the seat of power, and they are helping to keep it there. ~ William E. Dodd, U.S. Ambassador to Germany, 1937 The CIA, under the direction of Allen Dulles and later by Richard Helms, literally combed the hidden jungles of the world looking for exotic and undiscovered drugs from both botanical and fauna sources and through a pharmacopeia of current and known drugs and chemicals as well as new drugs formulated by secretly contracted pharmaceutical companies or universities. 97 These CIA mind- control operations were carried out with the participation of a least 185 scientists and at least 80 American institutions, including prisons, pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, and 44 medical colleges and universities. Many of America’s most prestigious institutes of medical research had also cooperated with the CIA, as well as numerous big name corporations. 98 In an article published in the April 1971, issue of Science Digest , Prof. George Eastabrooks, a U.S. military intelligence expert, discussed applied techniques in Forced Hypnosis developed by the Rand Corporation in the memorandum"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 46 “Inducing Hypnosis Against A Person’s Will.” 99 Eastabrooks boasted of splitting the personality of what he describes as a “vulnerable” U.S. Marine Lieutenant during WWII. He named these personalities “Jones A” and “Jones B.” Jones A was programmed to become a communist and was given a dishonorable discharge by the Marine Corps to unknowingly infiltrate communist cells to the extent he became a card carrying party member. At the same time, Jones B, the deeper personality became the silent controller who knew what was really going on but had been programmed to remain silent but watchful and able, under hypnosis, to report back the experiences of Jones A – the “created” communist. This obviously was without the consent or knowledge of Lt. “Jones.” Eastabrook described the use of hypnosis in military applications as “dangerous,” “nightmarish,” and not very “tidy.” Building upon decades of preliminary work in the study of human breaking points and control by the Tavistock Institute in London, Himmler’s Lebensborn project, and Mengele’s studies in Auschwitz, some of the known unorthodox techniques of “beneficial brainwashing” using high-tech sound and feedback continuous loop techniques by notorious doctors such as Dr. Ewen Cameron 100 of the Allen Memorial Institute at McGill University in Canada (founder of the American Psychiatry Association) and Dr. Sydney Gottlieb of the CIA, and also through their hired experimenters in various Universities, clinics and in the pharmaceutical industry, included: 1. Surreptitious drugging with toxins, hallucinogenic and psychotropic drugs such as LSD, mescaline derivatives, super-concentrations of cannabis extracts, and psilocybin 2. Sleep deprivation, drug-induced comas, the infamous “Sleep Room” therapy of forced and extended sleep of up to several months of continuous sleep. 3. Sensory deprivation, “psychic driving,” “depatterning.” 4. Repetitive rounds of Page-Russell electro-shock treatments, electro- convulsive treatments. 5.

Hypnosis and other methods designed to interrogate, program or deprogram an individual. 101 This shocking level of unethical patient disregard shouldn’t come as a huge surprise; this kind of far-reaching research is what should reasonably be expected when one collaborates with Nazi war criminals and concentration camp human experimenters. Other sub-projects included formulating plans for contaminating a city’s water supply with LSD and chlorine-immune variant of LSD were also clandestinely developed. 102 Self-experimentation of LSD by the CIA staff involved may have corrupted moral controls and reservations on unwitting human subjects, and revealed concerns that the administering staff had become “unhinged.” 103 As these experiments were often conducted on unwitting subjects, or with severely limited informed consent, they constitute a violation of the Nuremberg Code of medical conduct that was devised in 1948 after the prosecution of Nazi medical doctors for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Many of the victims of MK-ULTRA and the sub-projects were able to successfully sue the CIA and also the Canadian government for their involvement in these heinous studies, 104 such as the surviving family of the MK-ULTRA and “suicided” victim Frank Olson, 105 and Paul Bonacci. 106 Other victims such as Brice Taylor, and Cathy O’Brien and Mark Phillips, James Stanley, Linda McDonald, Harold Blauer, and others have come forward and detailed their experiences. Another aspect of the extensive CIA sponsored mind control experiments were studies done on animals and also possibly on humans involving direct implantation of electrodes and other circuitry into the brain and effecting remote control with electric stimulus, with an eye for a wider future use in human subjects. 107 The known files on MK-ULTRA subproject 94, dated 22 November 1961 describe the goals: Studies with YOU in mind - You don't really think these are just for monkeys do you?"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 48 Miniaturized stimulating electrode implants in specific brain center areas will be utilized. The feasibility of remote control of activities in several species of animals has been demonstrated. The present investigations are directed toward improvement of techniques and will provide precise mapping of the useful brain centers. The ultimate objective of this research is to provide an understanding of the mechanisms involved in the directional control of animals and to provide practical systems suitable for (section deleted – ‘human’?) application. 108 Dr. Jose Delgado, a Yale Medical School and CIA funded researcher doing work in remote control applications of mind control stated: \"We need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society. The purpose is physical control of the mind. Everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated. Man does not have the right to develop his own mind. This kind of liberal orientation has great appeal. We must electrically control the brain. Some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain.\" 109 Think about that statement, “psychosurgery” for political control of our society. Those technologies could easily be expanded to widespread civilian application, if they could do it with the military, including even up to the rank of generals, why stop there? Dr. Delgado experimented with implants in animals and in a successful demonstration, controlled an implanted bull as a matador. 110 His device, called a Stimoceiver, was a miniature electrode capable of receiving and transmitting FM radio signals, and could be installed in a patient/victims cranium Delgado confirmed this line of reasoning when he stated in 1966 that his experiments: “support the distasteful conclusion that motion, emotion and behavior can be directed by electrical Implanted with BrainGate Neural Interface Electronic human remote control"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 49 Brain Interface and Spinal Sensor y Input Nodes from The Matrix forces and that humans can be controlled like robots bypush buttons.” 111 That was in 1966, what do they have now? In the March 2005 issue of Wired Magazine , author Richard Martin in an article simply titled “Mind Control,” 112 gives an eye-opening glimpse into the near-future of what is presently under rapid development in the field of man-machine interfaces, and it is literally something right out of the 1999 sci-fi movie The Matrix, and much like the language of the Star Trek cybernetic super-nemesis the Borg, the scientists working on these implantable devices marvel at the ability of the human brain to “assimilate” the machine. 113 There has also been whispered talk of using brain-computer interfaces to stifle antisocial tendencies and \"program\" acceptable behavior, which isn’t too far to extend to societal control, depending on who is doing the programming. Also consider, if this is the kind of result that benevolent and altruistic scientists are achieving working with paraplegics and the disabled, think to what level of technology and study results have been attained clandestinely by the type of malevolent people capable of planning and implementing MK-ULTRA and with black budgets in the billions of dollars. An obscure U.S. government report in 2002 indicates that within the next 20 years, it is desired that humanity either evolve or be technologically assisted into reaching a “hive mind.” It states: A draft government report says we will alter human evolution within 20 years by combining what we know of nanotechnology, biotechnology, IT and cognitive sciences. [...] Leading to telepathy, machine-to-human communication amplified personal sensory devices and enhanced intellectual capacity. People may download their consciousnesses into computers or other bodies even on the other side of the solar system, or participate in a giant \"hive mind\", a network of intelligences connected through ultra-fast communications networks. \"With knowledge no longer encapsulated in individuals, the distinction between individuals and the entirety of humanity would blur,\" the report says. \"Think"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 50 Vulcan mind-meld. We would perhaps become more of a hive mind - an enormous, single, intelligent entity. 114 The horrific and sometimes fatal experiments for development of effective methods of menticide actually resulted in the Congressional Church Hearings in 1977 after the “accidental” disclosure of thousands of secret documents that survived an order of shredding or incinerator destruction from CIA Director Richard Helms, who wanted to avoid any possible “embarrassment” to the Company 115 The full scale of these experiments is likely to remain unknown due to the destruction of documents, save those that were secreted away. Miles Copeland, a former CIA officer of some rank, said, “The congressional sub- committee which went into this got only the barest glimpse.” 116 According to the Senate Intelligence Subcommittee in 1977 investigating the CIA’s MK-ULTRA program: The research and development program, and particularly the covert testing programs, resulted in massive abridgements of the rights of American citizens, sometimes with tragic consequences. The deaths of two Americans can be attributed to these programs; other participants in the testing programs may still suffer from the residual effects. While some controlled testing of these subjects might be defended, the nature of the tests, their scale, and the fact that they were continued for years after the danger of surreptitious administration of LSD to unwitting individuals was known, demonstrate a fundamental disregard for the value of human life. 117 The technologies that have been described are probably just the tip of the iceberg. It would be foolishly naïve to assume that these types of experiments ended with the Congressional disclosure, or to underestimate what kind of technological advances in mind control in the areas of microwave and radio transmission, miniaturization of implants, nanotechnology, behavioral science, and drug discovery manufacture have been made since the 1960s-70s. Other bizarre research included experiments in the fields of psionic warfare, remote viewing, and other parapsychology phenomenon.

The material gathered by tireless and highly determined individuals indicates quite succinctly that we are beyond the realm of science fiction. 118 The MK-ULTRA research was born of the work by Nazi human experimenters and imported into the U.S. where over 750 top Nazi scientists worked for and further cultivated their hideous research the government in return for protection from the Nuremberg judgments. Their work found sympathetic benefactors within the U.S. government, intelligence community, and the military industrial complex to be able to receive massive covert funding, covert facilities, and supplied of unwitting people for these experiments to be carried out. If you think they don’t have plans for you, can you be so sure about your children? MK-ULTRA Dr. Ewen Cameron gives warning to those that would listen: It is not simply against future conspiracies of evil men which we have to guard ourselves but it is against ourselves, against weaknesses and faults in our own social order, in our own ways of living against which we have to be on continual guard. 119 Iraq Gulf War 1 and 2 and Depleted Uranium . During the first Gulf War, Desert Storm , U.S. and coalition troops were exposed to downwind chemical and biological weapons debris such as the nerve agents sarin, cyclosarin, tabun, and blister agents such as lewisite and sulpher- mustard agents from coalition air attacks and from intentional Iraqi depot destruction. The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) acknowledges that up to 101,000 U.S. troops were also exposed to a nightmare mixture of blister, nerve agent chemicals and biological agents from the U.S. destruction of Saddam’s biological and chemical weapons facility at Khamisiyah, 120 and at 23 other Iraqi depots. The Iraqis were known to follow Soviet chemical warfare doctrine and as a result, their chemical weapons were usually combinations, or “cocktails,” of toxins to increase their effectiveness. 121 "},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 52 The same report also indicates that not all exposed troops are being informed of their potential exposure. In addition to the Russian, British, Jordanian chemical and biological weapons found there at the Khamisiyah depot, American weapons were also discovered – and hurriedly destroyed to hide evidence of U.S. involvement in arming Iraq with illegal weapons that may have been instrumental in the attacks on Shiite Muslims and also ethnic Kurds. Chemical agent detection alarms in the Gulf War 1 theatre of operations were very frequent. According to the 1994 Reigle Report, alarms occurred for up to 14,000 detection devices 3 times a day (42,000 total alarms per incident), for chemical weapons detection in Desert Storm , and all of the alarms were dismissed by the DOD as malfunctions, user reading errors or false alarms. 122 Furthermore, according to the Reigle report, the detectors employed by coalition troops and positioned at bases were discovered to be calibrated under-sensitive to the agents in question by 1000 times; meaning that the detectors would not alert in the presence of dangerous agents unless they reached a threshold that chemical agents were still very capable of inflicting harm at levels 1000 times below the device detection range. 123 Experimental vaccines, such as a controversial anthrax vaccine and an injectable nerve gas antidote, were also administered or distributed to soldiers, many without prior human testing. 124 In fact, hidden from view from most servicemen, Executive Order 13139, signed by President Clinton in 1999, allows the government to waive informed consent for medical experimentation and administer FDA untested, unapproved vaccination programs. 125 This application of EO13139 can be done at any time at the request of the Secretary of Defense. The military doesn’t have to tell you what medication, experimental or otherwise, it’s giving you by Executive Order.

After Desert Storm , an estimated 425,000 veterans have reported multiple illnesses and medical problems related to Gulf War Syndrome, and over 11,000 U.S. troops have died from mysteriously-caused illnesses and cancers since returning home from Desert Storm . The Dept of Defense and the U.S. Veteran’s Administration continues to deny a linkage and stonewalls investigations into the cause. What other explanation can there be for a conflict that only lasted 100 hours on the ground that leaves this many casualties and medical anomalies? The grossly misleading and misnamed 'depleted' uranium is the by product left behind after enriched uranium is separated from natural uranium in order to produce fuel for nuclear reactors. During this process, the fissionable isotope uranium-235 is separated from uranium. The remaining uranium, which is 99.8% uranium-238, is misleadingly called 'depleted uranium'. 126 While the term 'depleted' implies it isn't particularly dangerous, in fact, this waste product of the nuclear industry is 'conveniently' disposed of by producing deadly weapons. Depleted uranium is chemically toxic. It is an extremely dense, hard metal, and can cause chemical poisoning to the body in the same way as can lead or any other heavy metal. However, depleted uranium is also radiologically hazardous, as it spontaneously burns on impact, creating tiny aerosolized glass particles which are small enough to be inhaled, even through protective gas masks. These uranium oxide particles emit all types of radiation, alpha, beta and gamma, and can be carried in the air over long distances through the vast sandstorms that occur in Iraq and the Middle East. Depleted uranium has a half life of 4.5 billion years, and the presence of depleted uranium ceramic aerosols can pose a long term threat to human health and the U.S. depleted uranium munitions"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 54 environment. Depleted uranium use in the battlefield is a weapon of mass destruction and is banned under international law as it is an indiscriminate weapon that affects combatants and non-combatants, enemy targets and blowback on friendly forces. As early as 1943, plans were being drawn up to utilize radioactive waste as a possible weapon for use on the battlefield. The classified top-secret Groves Memorandum, declassified on June 5, 1994 specifically mentions the usage of uranium for use as a versatile gas weapon. According to the Groves Memorandum: As a gas warfare instrument, the material would be ground into particles of microscopic size and would be distributed in the form of a dust or smoke or dissolved in liquid, by ground-fired projectiles, land vehicles, airplanes, or aerial bombs. In this form, it would be inhaled by personnel. The amounts necessary to cause death to a person inhaling the material is extremely small. An infinitesimal amount accumulating in a person’s body would be fatal in a few days to weeks depending upon the amount absorbed and its radioactivity. There are no known effective methods of treatment for such a casualty...It can be distributed in a dust or powder so finely powdered that it will permeate a standard gas mask filter in quantities. 127 Tens of thousands U.S. soldiers and hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqi’s are being exposed continually to heavy metal poisoning and depleted uranium waste radiation and its residual DNA damage. 128 This radiation exposure is resulting in massive rates of truly horrifying birth defects in Iraqi newborn children, Gulf War Syndrome 129 symptomology, cancers, leukemia’s, and other future side-effects yet to be seen in both soldiers and civilians. 130 In Baghdad alone, the birth defect and deformity rate is 3-5 times higher than normal. The birth defects and deformities, for example, from extreme hydrocephalus, are particularly horrifying and for reasons of reader sensitivity I have included only a few images"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 55 of them here, but they are widely available online. 131 The infants suffering from this genetic damage scarcely resemble human beings and they will disturb and haunt you. The most common question among parents of newborns in Iraq is not “is it a boy or a girl?” instead it is now “is it normal?” Not only are these deformities affecting Iraqi parents, children of U.S. soldiers are also experiencing higher than normal deformity rates. Nuclear weapons scientist Leuren Moret, a scientist formerly of the Livermore Nuclear Weapons Lab in California, stated the horrible impact upon the unborn of these radioactive and toxic weapons: Right after the first Gulf war maybe one or two babies a day were being born with defects. Now it's seven, eight, nine, ten babies a day who are born without heads, without limbs, horrible tumors. Just lumps of jelly.\" She rightly declares, \"It's a nightmare!\" 132 Munitions with depleted uranium are turned into a fine dust after impacting their targets, or the ground. 133 The radioactive dust then contaminates all, and is tenaciously persistent with all that it comes into contact with. Iraqi children are contaminated when playing with shell casings or on or near destroyed and abandoned military equipment. Soldiers clothing, personal equipment, and living quarters are contaminated from the DU dust. It may even be brought back home with their gear. Uranium dust particulate filled air is breathed into the lungs, contaminated food is ingested, and open wounds are susceptible to DU penetration, and permanently absorbed into the body. Severe birth deformit y child born to a U.S. Desert Storm veteran"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 56 Consider this, one of the most commonly described scenarios for another terrorists attack is to set off a “dirty bomb” device, defined as a weapon that explodes and disperses radioactive debris. It is considered WMD. Such an attack it would immediately cause FEMA and other agencies to respond with decontamination units and the victims would be at a higher risk for developing cancer related diseases, and would likely lead to an application of a localized martial law. Is there really any meaningful difference between the situations? Protective clothing or gear capable of protecting against depleted uranium exposure is not the norm in Iraq, there is a shortage of body armor, let alone resources and gear for DU clean-up for all of our soldiers deployed in those hot zones. MOPPS suits, the chemical warfare protection suit is limited to short term effectiveness after opening, making it unwieldy in regular operations, and do not protect long term. The U.S. and coalition troops have also not been properly warned or trained to deal with depleted uranium exposure, and the effects of DU have been minimized in what instruction and training that has been given. 134 In Operations Enduring Freedom Operation Iraqi Freedom, depleted uranium munitions were used directly in the Afghani and Iraqi cities, amidst civilian populations, and eventually, U.S. troops occupied Saddam’s palace’s and slept in the same areas they had just previously bombed. 135 Military vehicles returning from Iraq to the U.S. are subjected to a thorough decontamination process, and higher ranking officers are rotated out of Iraq on a more frequent basis than the average soldier. Furthermore, Iraq is a very arid country and suffers from lengthy and wide ranging sandstorms which serve to circulate the depleted uranium debris from the battlefields from the first Gulf War to the present, and from the “hot zones” to the cities and bases. There is no escape from it. Currently, the U.S. is fielding troops for second and third tours of duty in these radioactive zones. I wonder why high ranking officials and generals are rotated out more frequently of the Iraqi theater than the front-line Depleted uranium “shock and awe” in downtown Baghdad"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 57 soldiers are? Perhaps they know that they are being irradiated and don’t want radiation sicknesses and DNA genetic damage. According to the 2005 documentary film DU: Beyond Treason , 136 over 2700 tons of depleted uranium munitions have been used in Iraq between the time of operations in Desert Shield and Desert Storm and also during the ongoing Operation Enduring Freedom. For comparison, 800 tons is equivalent to the atomicity of 41,000 Nagasaki bombs. In Iraq, three (3) times that amount has been used to create a nuclear wasteland. There is nothing “depleted” about U-238 waste at all. Destroyed Iraqi tanks are a radiological hazard from DU sabot round attacks. It is creating a “dead-zone” on par with the Chernobyl reactor accident. 137 The background radiation in Baghdad is roughly 5 times the normal level – the equivalent of 3 chest X-rays per hour. 138 Depleted uranium inspector and former U.S. military, Doug Rokke says about the long term disaster for the widespread usage of depleted uranium: If I can detect high levels of radioactivity in the deserts of Iraq ten years after the bombing and I can take ordinary road dust from Kosovo where children are playing 13 months after the bombings there, then this stuff is going to stay around for a very long time to come. All I can say is that this is a complete disaster not only for the people of Iraq but for people who live anywhere in the world. 139 American Eugenics and Secret Sterilizations . Recently revealed in 2005, from the early 1900s to the 1970s, some 65,000 poor, uneducated (primarily black men and women), were sterilized in this country, many without their knowledge, as part of a government eugenics program to keep so-called “undesirables” from reproducing. 140 This medical experimentation is “social-Darwinism” and has a long and ugly history in the United States tentatively beginning in the 1890’s. In 1907, Indiana became the first state to legalize the forced sterilization of the poor, “feeble- minded,” prisoners, and the mentally ill. Thirty-four other"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 58 states soon followed, and collaboration began between American and German eugenicists, with the American legal model being emulated and adopted as the model for the racial cleansing laws of German National Socialists and reaching its apex industrial efficient mass- genocide in WWII. American eugenics found support in leading universities suchas Harvard, Columbia, and Cornell. The 1916 pro-eugenics film, “the Black Stork” advocated withholding medical treatment from “defective” babies, was shown in cinema houses for the general masses. 141 Financial support was given by J.H. Kellogg, the cereal producer, 142 and wells as support from the Rockefeller Foundation, 143 and many other well known multi-millionaire industrialist- philanthropists such as Andrew Carnegie and Alexander Graham Bell. 144 The issue of compulsory sterilization even reached the Supreme Court in the case of Buck v. Bell, 274 U.S. 200 (1927) with the Court upholding Virginia’s sterilization laws in 1927. 145 In the courts near unanimous decision, a decision which has not been successfully challenged and reversed - and under the courts legal principle of stare decisis , still valid case law, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, considered one of the Supreme Court’s leading jurists said: It is better for the world, if instead of waiting to execute offspring for crime, or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind. The principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the Fallopian tubes...Three generations of imbeciles are enough. 146 Margaret Sanger, an “outstanding” proponent and supporter of eugenicists created the Birth Control League, the forerunner to Planned Parenthood, 147 to further her goals of selective breeding, or extermination. 148 Life Magazine ranked her as one of the most important people of this century. In April 1932, she advocated giving “certain dysgenic (inferior genetics) groups in our population"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 59 their choice of segregation (concentration camps or “colonies,”) or sterilization.” 149 She appointed Lothrop Stoddard to the board of her Birth Control League. Stoddard was a leading proponent of eugenics, forced sterilization, and also the Adolph Hitler. 150 In another of her speeches promulgating the benefits of eugenics, she emphasizes the “breeding out of “human weeds-the defectives.” She said: (It) makes possible the spread of scientific knowledge of the elements of sound breeding. It makes possible the creation of a new race; a new generation brought into this world consciously conceived. It makes possible the breeding out of human weeds-the defective and criminal classes-(and) the breeding in of the clean, strong and fit instruments to carry the torch of human destiny. 151 The American eugenics movement consisted of various methods including targeted locations for abortion clinics based on racial concentrations, selective breeding, coercive sterilizations, surreptitious hysterectomies and castrations under false pretense, and genetic screening. Now with the success of the DNA human genome sequencing project, race-specific genetic weapons are possibly now under development, 152 and the creation of designer babies according to patent designs. The conservative think tank, the Project for the New American Century wrote in a policy paper that: “Genetically targeted weapons could change world politics for ever, and the report notes, advanced forms of biological warfare that can target specific genotypes may transform biological warfare from the realm of terror to a politically useful tool.” 153 It’s just another repackaging of the old pursuit of master-race. But it’s all just a coincidence, nothing to worry about. History can’t repeat itself. U.S. Pesticide Studies on Humans, Prisoners, and Children . Chemical and Pesticide Manufacturers such as Dow and Monsanto, the same companies that developed and tested Dioxin and Agent Orange of humans, would be allowed to test some pesticides on human volunteers when seeking government approval without applying all the ethical safeguards recommended"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 60 last year by an advisory panel, under proposed relaxing of rules soon to be issued by the Environmental Protection Agency. 154 The rules would omit some provisions urged by the National Academy of Sciences last year that would have imposed more stringent limits on such studies. The agency would allow the exercise of loopholes to test pesticides on humans to determine at what level they become toxic. This could include tests on prisoners even though they might be vulnerable to coercion. Hidden deep within the guidelines were levels of exceptions to allow testing on abused or neglected children without parental consent, “ethically deficient” human research if it is beneficial to “protect public health,” and if there is more than minimal health risk to a subject if there is a “direct benefit to the child being tested and the parents agree. 155 How can any child benefit to direct exposure to pesticides? Senator Barbara Boxer from California claimed in protest to the abhorrent rules: “The EPA proposed rule on human testing has several large loopholes that undermine the very purpose of the rule. No wonder the pesticide companies are saying such nice things about it.” 156 Coercive Experimentation on Mentally Retarded Children . In the 1950’s, the Atomic Energy Commission funded a 30 year study, a series of experiments where retarded children were fed porridge laced with radioactive milk at the Fernald school in Massachusetts under the supervision of Harvard and MIT researchers. 157 Other less fortunate students at Fernald were selected for special “Science Clubs” and were given radioactive injections of calcium and iron to determine how it would affect metabolism. The letter of consent that was sent to the parents was extremely misleading and omitted crucial information about the experiments saying that “the children would receive a special diet in an effort to study how the body absorbed cereals, iron and vitamins.\" Radioactivity was never mentioned. 158 A task force later conducted by the Massachusetts Task Force on Human Subject Research later determined that the research, and the"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 61 researchers, were conducted “in violation of fundamental human rights” and had violated the human rights of the students. 159 These callous doctors, under government sanction and funding, demonstrated an unprincipled willingness to abuse their power and a casual disregard to fundamental human rights and patient care. They preyed upon the weakest of the weak, those unable to defend themselves or even know they were being cruelly and deceitfully experimented on. These types of experiments, and others presented in these pages, demonstrate a sinister and rotten-to-the-core attitude among society’s elite rulers that can authorize somehow seek comfort in extracting information of worthless or dubious medical value. Another example of government funded tests on helpless patients include the Willowbrook study where mentally deficient, but otherwise healthy children were purposely infected with live hepatitis virus, fed infected stool extracts, and then dosed with refined hepatitis virus to study vaccines and gamma globulin in amelioration or prevention protocols. In predominantly many cases, patients were coerced into participating in order to receive admission to the hospital care facilities. 160 The AIDS-HIV Guinea Pig Kids . Another heinous discovery was uncovered in New York City. In the documentary The Guinea Pig Kids , 161 by BBC reporter Jamie Doran, disclosed after a nine month investigation, that the giant pharmaceutical drug company GlaxoSmithKline was exposed giving orphans and babies as young as three months old potentially dangerous medical experiments with HIV vaccines, including designer “cocktails” consisting of as many as seven drugs at the Incarnation Children’s Center, a Catholic orphanage for HIV positive children. The majority of the children forcibly enrolled were poor African-American and Hispanic. Some of the drugs administered were AZT, nevirapine, antiretrovirals such as didanozine, and stavudine, and are known to be highly toxic and cause serious side effects. 162 Trials were conducted beginning in 1995 and four series of"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 62 experiments were performed. Some of the experiments were to determine the toxicity of the AIDS vaccines and treatment medications. Children somehow who managed to give a refusal, were still forcibly dosed through stomach tubes inserted through the abdomen, a surgical procedure against their will. Parents were pressured and coerced into leaving their children in the studies by New York City’s Administration for Children’s Services, which holds considerable and potential abusive powers. 163 The drug studies were funded by federal agencies such as the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (a division of the National Institute of Health.) 164 Dr David Rasnick, a visiting scholar at the University of Berkeley gave his opinion on the experiments: \"We're talking about serious, serious side-effects. These children are going to be absolutely miserable. They're going to have cramps, diarrhea, and their joints are going to swell up. They're going to roll around the ground and you can't touch them.\" He went on to describe some of the drugs - supplied by major drug manufacturers including GlaxoSmithKline - as \"lethal.\" 165 These evil mad scientists, terrorists in lab coats, are experimenting on children without regard to medical ethics. For these vulnerable, poor, and “abused by the system” children and orphans, there were no rich adoptive Daddy Warbucks to rescue them, no hopeful song that “Sun’ll come out tomorrow.” 166 With callous and unethical disregard for their safety they were experimented upon with government sanction and obeisance, by the pharmaceutical industry. They treated these children as if they were lab rats to further their medical careers, or to pad their research grants. Those could be your children in some secret pharmaceutical lab. This type of behavior by the medical establishment, the drug industry, and the government that encourages and permits these abuses, were they to be diagnosed by a clinical psychologist, would likely qualify as psychopathic behavior. Despite the built-in morality of most human beings, the medical establishment proceeded in these experiments along the patterns of authority-based human"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 63 behavior established and demonstrated by the Milgram studies at Yale University in the 1970’s. 167 The medical establishment has become the willing handmaiden to both the military establishment and also to the pharmaceutical industry, becoming high paid drug pushers. These children and the mentally vulnerable were at the mercy of monsters of the highest order of depravity and evil, pharmaceutical prostitutes that would manipulate, coerce, and abuse their patients, their study “property” all in order to keep their industry grants and government funding. Do you feel indignation and outrage yet? Are you beginning to get the picture now? Can you continue to deny the obvious? Are you still clinging to the comfort and false sense of security created by the gullibility that the government depends on from you? I was tricked and lied to just as you were. There is so much history that has been purposefully and intentionally withheld, and concealed from you. Veteran’s benefits are under constant assault and budget cuts leading to short-changing our troops and cuts in quality and quantity for medical and psychological treatment. 168 This is your loving, protecting, beneficent government. It acts like a psychopath. It operates on the Machiavellian principle that the “ends justify the means.” 169 On the government balance sheet, people are viewed as expendable assets or they are “useless eaters.” It has no hesitancy, qualms or moral reservations of using people for lab subjects, tricking people, engaging in deception to advance their goals and plans.

LeMay Operation Northwoods. In 1962, just prior to the Cuban Missile Crisis and with Cold War tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union heightening, the US military, with the authorization of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), and under the command of Army General Lyman L. Lemnitzer, insanely devised top- secret, special handling plans to bring the U.S. into war with Cuba, code named Operation Northwoods. 1 The United States government actually devised plans to justify attacking and killing its own citizens to drag us into a war. Does this sound familiar to you yet? Among the evil laundry list of mechanisms to trigger the desired conflict were plans to: 1. Stage terror attacks in major US cities such as Washington, D.C., and Miami. 2. Perform assassinations of Cuban émigrés, 3. Sabotage, sink refugee ships, 4. Stage hijackings and/or aircraft destruction through remote detonation or shoot-downs. 5. Blowup remote controlled airliners packed with U.S. citizens. 6. stage attacks upon U.S. military assets like the sinking a of US warship in port, bragging how it would be similar to what was done to the battleship Maine in Havana Harbor before the Spanish American War. 7.

Publish lists of fatalities in national newspapers to spark a wave of public indignation and anger. These combinations of triggers were to be used all to trick the US public into vengefully fury to demand a war with Cuba and also confirm to the American public the malevolency of Communism. Do you see a pattern, a government modus operandi yet? Connect the dots for yourself. Operation Northwoods is literally the playbook for 9/11. This strategy is another classic example of the Hegelian Dialectic, problem- reaction-solution being attempted to bring the U.S. into military conflict and to deceive the American public into supporting a war they previously no interest for. Fortunately for the American people President Kennedy quashed this heinous plan and retired the General shortly afterwards. One year later, Kennedy was dead of an assassin’s Magic Bullet at Dealey Plaza. This plan speaks volumes about the criminal and utterly diabolical mindset that certain cadres of military leadership were already planning events in those Dr. Strangelove terms and was able to advance them all the way to the level of the Secretary of Defense, Robert S. McNamara. It also uniquely foreshadows the tragic events of 9/11 that go beyond just a haunting ring of coincidence. President Kennedy made reference in a speech after the Cuban Missile Crisis at American University of a concern that there was a group with a “collective death wish for the world.” 2 James Bamford, a highly respected investigative historian, and also a former producer and reporter for ABC News, disclosed the long-lost documents of Operation Northwoods in his book Body of Secrets: Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National Security Agency , also spoke in an interview that there was a worry that the highest echelons of military leadership had lost their collective minds : The Joint Chiefs of Staff drew up and approved plans for what may be the most corrupt plan ever created by the U.S. government. Although no one in Congress could have known at the time, Lemnitzer and the Joint Chiefs had quietly slipped"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 68 over the edge. There really was a worry at the time about the military going off crazy and they did, but they never succeeded, but it wasn't for lack of trying. 3 Operation Gladio and P2OG . Operation Gladio is the decades long terror campaign orchestrated by the CIA, British MI6 Intelligence, and other NATO forces, and was later reorganized as P2OG, which is the acronym for Proactive, Preemptive Operations Group. 4 Many operations were conducted that targeted innocent women and children civilians to raise public furor over the falsely blamed parties and to demonize the designated enemies. Many of the original Gladio operatives were former German Nazi SS troops and officers. 5 These small-unit military cells moved beyond just the planning or training stages of false flag black operations, as seen in Operation Northwoods, but were actually implemented by so-called “Left Behind” 6 forces to stage assassinations, electoral sabotage, political repression, and bombing terror- attacks located in France, West Germany, Italy, 7 Belgium, Spain, and across Eastern Europe. 8 These types of false-flag terror attacks by allied forces have already been uncovered, but remain unreported by the mainstream media. In September 2005, two British SAS special force soldiers were captured by Iraqi police with Arab disguises, heavily armed, possessing explosives, and in a covert action after driving at and shooting at allied Iraqi police. 9 The situation became so intense that British Army tanks and armored vehicles were called in to rescue the pair from further interrogation by demolishing the police station that the pair were held in, and then they too came under attack from local enraged citizens, managing to disable on armored personnel carrier. The British government, in an act of admission, has apologized for the incident and is making reparations to the Basra local government and citizens. 10 In October 2005, it was reported that two American’s, in Arab dress in Iraq were arrested after apparently attempted to set off a car bomb in a residential area of Baghdad. 11 These are classic examples of false-flag P2OG operations. "},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 69 The U.S. Army field manual FM-3031B 12 details methods for conducting a terror campaign in states that do not respond to possible “communist subversion.” The P2OG agitation and provocateur teams are sent in to stir up the hornets nest, create anger and violent reactions among local populations. They intentionally provoke with acts of violence designed to encourage the terrorist/insurgent cells into committing to a responding attack. Then, when the populations react, the governments that sent the P2OG can point to them and label them terrorists and take even harsher and repressive public actions against them. Researcher Chris Floyd speaks on P2OG: \"Let's say this plainly, clearly and soberly, so that no one can mistake the intention of Rumsfeld’s plan - the United States government is planning to use `cover and deception' and secret military operations to provoke murderous terrorist attacks on innocent people. Let's say it again: Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, George W. Bush, and the other members of the unelected regime in Washington plan to deliberately foment the murder of innocent people - your family, your friends, your lovers, you - in order to further their geopolitical ambitions. They will plot \"imaginary terror attacks' on the U.S. and then thwart them, \"...reassuring you that they will protect you by taking your rights away. 13 Gladio Operative Vincenzo Vinciguerra gave the sworn testimony in trial regarding the methods of persuasion: You had to attack civilians, the people, women, children, innocent people, unknown people far removed from any political game. The reason was quite simple: to force ... the public to turn to the state to ask for greater security. 14 In May of 2002, a U.S. Army soldier from nearby Ft. Stewart, was caught and arrested speeding away by an attentive local officer after placing explosives underneath a Jacksonville, FL power line cable near a power station. 15 The culprit, Army Spc. Derek Peterson, was arrested with possession of gear typical for a covert operation: black camouflage clothing, protective elbow and kneepads, and heavy armed for an alleged “recon drill.” If this was a lone right-wing nut, a Timothy McVeigh-type bomber, engaging in home-grown terror, he would have been dragged before the courts openly and publicly displayed to the nation, and"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 70 tried. Instead, he has had secret, closed hearings and has remained off the attention of the media – and hidden from the public. Why? Unless he was actually acting under orders to create false-flag terror attacks to cast blame upon middle-eastern scapegoats, ala a Northwood’s scenario. Neoconservative Empire-Building Motives . The Project for a New American Century, 16 a Neoconservative think tank, prepared a policy document – a blue-print for a bloody Pax Americana - that outlined the desire for the U.S. to exploit its sole super-power status and to secure oil and mineral resources in the Middle East and Central Asia while denying opposing or rising world powers the ability to interfere. They specifically foresaw, and addressed a need for, a new Pearl Harbor to create a desire in the public and the Congress as a focusing event to justify a massive increase in the defense budget and a foreign policy agenda to establish control in the Middle East: A transformation strategy that solely pursued capabilities for projecting force from the United States, for example, and sacrificed forward basing and presence, would be at odds with larger American policy goals and would trouble American allies. Further, the process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event – like a new Pearl Harbor . 17 [My emphasis] This kind of language is reminiscent of the Nazi World View Warfare, termed Weltanschauungskrieg propaganda. 18 This provocative statement by the architects of the Neocons didn’t even raise the eyebrows of the 9/11 Commission, or any other official government investigator in the FBI or the CIA. Others closely affiliated with the PNAC made statements that the 9/11 attacks created “opportunities” for the U.S. Former Senator Gary Hart, (D-CO) a co-chairman on the Council on Foreign Relations stated just after the attacks: “There is a chance for the President of the United States to use the disaster...to carry out what his father - a phrase his father used I think only once, and it hasn't been used since - and that is a New World Order.” Former Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 71 Netanyahu claimed a benefit from the attacks as well, he was asked what the 9/11 attacks meant for US/Israeli relations. Netanyahu replied: \"It's very good.\" Then Netanyahu added: \"Well, not very g ood, but it will generate immediate sympathy.\" 19 These people were actually seeing a “silver lining” in the deaths of 3000 people and the massive destruction. Zbigniew Brzezinski, (former National Security Advisor to President Carter and also a Council of Foreign Relations member) in an amazing feat of prophesy also wrote in his book, The Grand Chessboard that only another Pearl Harbor could con the U.S. public into accepting an invasion of Central Asia: The attitude of the American public toward the external projection of American power has been much more ambivalent. The public supported America's engagement in World War II largely because of the shock effect of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor...as America becomes an increasingly multicultural society, it may find it more difficult to fashion a consensus on foreign policy issues, except in the circumstances of a truly massive and wide ly perceived direct external threat. Such a consensus generally existed during World War II and even during the Cold War...In the absence of a comparable external challenge, American society may find it much more difficult to reach agreement regarding foreign policies that cannot be directly related to central beliefs and widely shared cultural-ethnic sympathies and that still require an enduring and some times costly imperial engagement. 20 Brzezinski briefly exhibits a buried contempt for the American system of government when he also writes that “The pursuit of power and especially the economic costs and human sacrifice that the exercise of such power often requires are not generally congenial to democratic instincts...Democracy is inimical to imperial mobilization.” 21 To pursue this course of establishing an American empire, he suggests the masses of “unwashed” people be controlled so that they, WE, are unable to prevent their plans. He says in total derision and condescending language and in the elitist hubris and philosophy of self-perceived superiority to the common person: “To put it in a terminology that hearkens back to the more brutal age of ancient empires, the three grand imperatives of imperial"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 72 geostrategy are to prevent collusion and maintain security dependence among the vassals, to keep tributaries pliant and protected, and to keep the barbarians from coming together.” That kind of language and attitude very clearly establishes a psychological mindset and gives clues to motive, at the least a strong and highly suspicious desire by the Neocon’s for a Pearl Harbor-type event. They were frothing at the mouth, chomping on the bit for something like this to happen. In the application of the basic investigatory principles of cui bono to the 9/11 attacks, this kind of almost wishful language should be given very strong scrutiny. Let’s apply this to different hypothetical scenario removed from the emotional imagery of the attacks of 9/11. The statements by the main think tank for the Neo-Conservative agenda is akin to someone taking out a large multi-million dollar insurance policy on their spouse and then making an announcement in the local newspaper that they wished their spouse were dead or were dead so they could remarry or so they could collect on the policy. Then, just a year later, and with amazing coincidence, convenience, and timing, the insured person on whom the policy was created for dies in a suspicious looking car accident with the bonus of a double indemnity benefit payoff to the beneficiary, who stands back and claims both incompetence and ignorance at how anyone could have foreseen the insured’s death, and the police and insurance companies neglect to conduct a thorough and complete investigation. The PNAC document calling for a helpful Pearl Harbor and Brzezinski’s writings for control of Middle East oil resources have the DNA and fingerprints of 9/11 all over them. Who benefits? Who profits?

In light of these revelations, it is time to question whether the officially attributed sources of many of the terrorist attacks that were inflicted upon other nation- states of the world, such as the questionable London train system bombings of 7 July 2005, were actually done by those blamed, or were in fact, government state- sponsored terrorism.

Wall Street is the CIA. ~ Michael Ruppert Unusual Stock Market Trades . Immediately prior to the attacks of 9/11, there was an unusually heavy spike of 600% of 1575 put options on United Airlines, and 2,258 on United Airlines (compared to normal orders of 390 and 220 respectively), as well as on several stocks of the major insurance and financial tenants, such as Merrill-Lynch and Morgan Stanley in the WTC complex. 1 Put options are highly leveraged bets that predict that the stock of the company will drop in value at a future date, and are considered as very risky. Investors could have made up to thirty times the investment, given the huge drop in values these stocks suffered. 2 These high volume, put options are statistically too precisely targeted on affected 9/11 businesses to account for random chance and luck. Only insider information can allow for such successful and strategic market bets. In fact, due to their success, the options were never claimed by the investors because they raised so many troubling red flags after the attack. Many of those put options were managed by the Wall Street firm Deutschebank/AB Brown, a firm managed until 1998 by the current Executive Director of the CIA, A.B. \"Buzzy\" Krongard. 3 Lynne Howard, a spokeswoman for the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), stated that information about who made the trades was available immediately: We would have been aware of any unusual activity right away. It would have been triggered by any unusual volume. There is an automated system called 'blue sheeting,' or the CBOE Market Surveillance System, that everyone in the business knows about. It provides information on the trades - the name and even the Social Security number on an account - and these surveillance systems are set up specifically to look into insider trading. The system would look at the volume, and"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 76 then a real person would take over and review it, going back in time and looking at other unusual activity. 4 Real-Time Monitoring of Financial Markets . Additionally, these types of unusual stock market transactions are capable of being, and as a matter of procedure are, monitored in real-time by the CIA with a combination of technologies and AI (Artificial Intelligence) wrapped under the umbrella term of PROMIS software. Michael Ruppert, in his best selling book, Crossing the Rubicon: The Decline of the American Empire at the End of the Age of Oil, describes some of PROMIS’ data tracking and predicting abilities as follows: PROMIS stands for Prosecutor's Management Information System. The PROMIS-managed data could be anything from financial records of banking institutions to compilations of various records used to track the movement of terrorists. This is but the barest glimpse of what PROMIS can do. Mated with artificial intelligence it is capable of analyzing not only an individual's, but also a community's entire life, in real time. It is also capable of issuing warnings when irregularities appear and of predicting future movements based upon past behavior. PROMIS holds unique abilities to track terrorists. The software has also, according to numerous sources including Hamilton, been modified with artificial intelligence and developed in parallel for the world's banking systems to track money movements, stock trades and other financial dealings. In the financial arena PROMIS is even more formidable. Not only is it capable of predicting movements in financial markets and tracking trades in real time. It has been reported, on a number of occasions, to have been used, via the \"back door\" to enter secret bank accounts, including accounts in Switzerland and then remove the money in those accounts without being traced. 5 Quashed Financial Investigations . These unusual spikes in the stock markets should have immediately set off red- flags, heightened the alert status of, and scrambled into action, the intelligence community of this country measurably. 6 Instead, they were ignored, or blocked, and with gross negligence.

Why haven’t"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 77 these powerful and massively resourced agencies released this information? Someone or a group of people with an insider’s knowledge of the pending events profited off this tragedy, profited off the blood spilled on the sidewalks of New York, and from the mangled wreckage and bodies of the 3000 victims slaughtered. Why is this unique group of investors being protected and their activities prior to 9/11 covered up? Is it credible that Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda have the ability to frustrate and quash these investigations here in the U.S. and in other several other nations? Or, is it more likely than not that a group within the U.S. government has incredible power to be able to quash, suppress, block, or stymie these investigations, not only here in the United States, but also in other countries. There has been no meaningful Congressional inquiry, no media inquiry, no outrage; yet we get three months of Natalie Holloway coverage from Aruba, the Michael Jackson molestation trial, and almost two years worth of the Scott and Laci Peterson missing/murdered mother drama and trial. That is an extraordinary and unprecedented power to cover-up and by its sheer scope implicates the U.S government. No other known entity has the ability and means to shut down and obfuscate these investigations. Compare this lack of action on the 9/11 stock trades to the legal treatment and imprisonment Martha Stewart received for her inside information tip and sale of the stock ImClone Systems to avoid a stock loss of only $45,673. 7 Tips to Privileged Individuals and Companies . Several unbelievably fortunate individuals and tower tenants received extraordinary and timely warnings prior to 9/11, changed their plans, and survived the attacks. 8 Does Al-Qaeda routinely take the extra time to call these lucky individuals to warn them? Does Al-Qaeda give warning to Israeli interests? If it wasn’t Al-Qaeda dishing out the warnings, then who was? Why weren’t they sharing that valuable warning with the WTC Towers property management and tenants, government, the media, or more importantly, law enforcement? Why didn’t those warned give notice to others, especially law enforcement, of the"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 78 possible attacks that they themselves held to be credible enough to act upon? The answer is that of course it wasn’t Al-Qaeda that supplied the warnings, but someone or other group that still wanted the buildings attacked and destroyed. Some of the many warnings included the following: 1. Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was scheduled to give a presentation to Israeli support groups, abruptly cancelled his appearance one day before 9/11. 9 2. San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown received a low-key warning 8 hours prior to his flight to avoid flights to New York the morning of 9/11. 10 3. Odigo, a start-up Instant Messaging Company (with close ties to Israel), two hours before the attacks, workers received an anonymous text instant message warning. All company workers in the building were evacuated and survived the attacks and the building collapses. 11 The Tel Aviv offices of Odigo are next door to the Institute for Counter Terrorism. 12 4. Salmon Rushdie, under constant Scotland Yard protection, was prevented from flying internally in the country beginning Sept. 3, 2001. 13 5. Zim American Israeli Shipping Co. broke a tenant lease WTC in the days leading up to 9/11 and evacuated their offices on the 16th and 17th floors of the North Tower, owing nearly $50,000 in penalties to Silverstein Properties, WTC leaseholder. 14 6. Senior Pentagon officials and generals cancelled travel plans for 9/11 the night before the attacks after receiving a particularly urgent warning. 15 7. Attorney General John Ashcroft received a FBI “threat assessment” 6 six weeks prior to 9/11 and was advised to travel only by leased private jet for the remainder of his term. 16 Ashcroft also reportedly warned members of Congress not to fly commercial aircraft as early as August 2001, according to a statement made by Senator Hillary Clinton (D-NY) in a C-SPAN interview in 2002. 17 "},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 79 War is a Racket I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high cl ass muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers.

In over 100 years of steel frame architecture, fire has never brought down, before or after 9/11, a steel high rise building. On 9/11, the government supposes for you to believe that an unprecedented three happened on the very same day (two each within an hour of being hit), and with fires that were considered by firefighters as manageable and by building engineers to be very short in duration and of low intensity – cool fires, compared to other more serious high-rise fires, such as the 1991 One Meridian Plaza in Philadelphia, or the 2005 Windsor Building in Madrid Spain that were substantially longer in duration and with higher intensity heat that did not lead to collapse. 19 The Official U.S. Conspiracy Theory for the Collapses . The officially accepted U.S. government conspiracy theory for the two World Trade Center Tower collapses is centered on the fire-based causation premise that: 1) the aircraft collisions damaged and weakened each structure, 2) that the jet fuel fed an raging inferno that created intensely high temperatures that further thermally weakened the already damaged steel columns (which may have also suffered damage to their"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 81 fireproofing materials) and steel floor joists which, in turn, 3) caused the structure, the columns and steel trusses to collapse upon each other, in a massive runaway and hyper-rapid chain reaction, known as the progressive or the “pancake” theory. 20 Introductory Physics and the WTC Fires . To understand the absurdity of the government theory that the steel framed construction of the towers was weakened by a raging jet-fuel hydrocarbon fire, it is necessary to have a few basic scientific facts in hand. For a much more in-depth analysis of the shortcomings of the progressive theory, truss failure, and zipper theory collapses, I direct your attention to the invaluable resources online, which I draw heavily on here: http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/fires/index.html . Hydrocarbon based fires, which include kerosene-based aviation jet-fuel, do not burn at temperatures sufficient to weaken the grade of steel used in the WTC structures. The melting point of iron is 1538°C (2800°F), 21 as structural steel is usually a composition of various metals and different carbon levels; the melting point of steel commonly used in building construction is 1510 ° C (2750°F). The maximum temperature of hydrocarbon fires burning in the atmosphere without pressurization or pre-heating (premixed fuel and air with blue flame) is about 800°C. Diffuse flames, such as those observed in WTC-1 and WTC-2, tend to be much cooler. Another critical factor is the length of time for steel to be continuously heated to reach failure and load bearing capacity. Steel-framed construction, even uninsulated framing, quickly radiates heat away through its columns and framing. The steel frame is essentially a massive heat sink, and disperses the heat throughout the structure, and avoids intense concentrations that would allow the heat to build up to dangerous load-weakening levels. A short duration of intense heat will not cause a steel frame to reach red-hot or orange glowing temperatures, which would be visible even in daylight. 22 As the jet fuel left over after the impact"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 82 WTC-2 South Tower – No ra g in g inferno – note the survivor in the center Wide-an g le - Main South Tower impact area – No raging or major fires Close-up of survivor – No intense f ires fireballs burned off, quite rapidly in fact according to the governments own scientists, the heat would have diminished rapidly as well. Another common factor in high rise fires is window breakage due to heat build- up. In typical fires the temperatures needed to be reached to cause this damage is usually around 600°C. In the World Trade Center fires, this type of damage was not observed, excluding the immediate impact areas or the intentional breaks created by desperate jumpers. Minimal, Low Intensity, and Short Duration Fires . One of the essential basic facts of the 9/11 fires is that most of the volatile jet fuel (essentially kerosene) from both of the 767 aircraft was burned off quickly, or consumed immediately by the impact fireballs, one of which primarily and spectacularly erupted on the outside of the building. The government’s own scientists admit the fires did not burn for very long or very intensely. Dr. Shyam Sunder, Lead Investigator of the Nations Institute of Standards and Techno-logy (NIST) said: \" The jet fuel probably burned out in less than 10 minutes . And what did burn over the next hour, or hour and a half, was much of the contents of the buildings.\" 23 Those are the results from the governments own paid scientists indicating that the spilled fuel of the aircraft did not long contribute to"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 83 fires observed. Additionally, from the photographic evidence, just minutes after the initial airliner impacts, dozens of still-trapped survivors were witnessed clinging to the openings of the impact areas, pleading for rescue, or planning to leap to their horrible deaths below. How hot could it have been if people were able to be in the open areas of the impact holes? Certainly not hot enough for them to grasp hold of the steel and aluminum beams, and not hot enough or smoke-filled enough to cause them to succumb to heat related injuries or smoke inhalation. Certainly not hot enough to be melting the soles of their shoes on the same flooring that was supposedly heating to structural failure, and amid an alleged 10,000 gallons of burning aviation jet-fuel, as the government contends. The remaining fires were localized and burning themselves out and did not spread further from their point of origin. Most of the fuel that was feeding the smothered fire was burning was office materials and those materials tend to burn cool, and inefficient; the dark black smoke color characteristic of soot with a poor fuel-air mixture and thick venting patterns proves it. Kevin Ryan, a scientist for Underwriter Laboratory’s said that the WTC fires only reached a maximum of 250°C (500°F), and that the steel used in the WTC construction was more than capable of handling the brief thermal load, and he suggests an alternative method caused the collapses: Your comments suggest that the steel was probably exposed to temperatures of only about 500°F (250°C), which is what one might expect from a thermo- dynamic analysis of the situation. The buildings should have easily withstood the thermal stress caused by the burning jet fuel”, he said. “If steel did soften or melt, this was certainly not due to jet fuel fires of any kind, let alone the briefly burning fires in those towers. That fact should be of great concern to all Americans. We know that the steel components were certified to ASTM E119. The time temperature curves for this standard require the samples to be exposed to temperatures around 2000°F for several hours. And as we all agree, the steel applied met those specifications. Additionally, I think we can all agree that even un-fireproofed steel will not melt until reaching red-hot temperatures of nearly 3000°F (2). Why Dr. Brown would imply that 2000°F would melt the high-grade steel used in those buildings makes no sense at all."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 84 This story just does not add up. If steel from those buildings did soften or melt, I'm sure we can all agree that this was certainly not due to jet fuel fires of any kind, let alone the briefly burning fires in those towers. That fact should be of great concern to all Americans. Alternatively, the contention that this steel did fail at temperatures around 250C suggests that the majority of deaths on 9/11 were due to a safety-related failure. That suggestion should be of great concern to my company. 24 Kevin Ryan was fired from his position immediately after filing that report. Apparently Mr. Ryan did not get the official memorandum to only find and report ad hoc evidence in confirmation of the ‘official story’ and some authority higher up didn’t like his results. This is the classic “Galileo effect.” I suppose the world is still flat and the sun orbits the earth too. James Quintiere, Professor of Fire Engineering at the University of Maryland also expresses deep reservations about the ability of jet fuel fires to cause steel core/framed buildings to collapse in little over an hour. He writes that: The jet fuel fires in the World Trade Center towers did not bring down those two buildings. Indeed, the fuel burned up in minutes. Why, then, did the towers and their 44-story neighbor, WTC-7, which was not struck by a plane, collapse? It's a question that bears generally on fire safety, the safety of building occupants and firefighters and the vulnerability of our buildings to terror by fire...High-rise buildings are required to survive the impact of a modern commercial aircraft. Why shouldn't that include survival from the fire that would erupt? Building codes require that the structural elements of high-rise building withstand a three- hour test in a furnace. Why did the buildings collapse in less time? 25 Matthys Levy, an authored and a 50-year experienced building engineer, who has designed and built such massive structures as the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, GA appeared in a 9/11 documentary for the Discovery Channel and stated that: “If you’ve seen many of the managed demolitions, where they implode a building and they cause it essentially to fall vertically because they cause all of the vertical"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 85 columns to fail simultaneously, that’s exactly what it looked like, and that’s what happened.” 26 Jerry Russell, PhD, holding a Masters in Engineering from Stanford, claims that the collapses were more likely the result of controlled demolition than from fire damage. He writes: Fires do not destroy skyscrapers. Never in the history of steel frame structures has a single one been destroyed by fire. How to destroy a skyscraper. So, how do you destroy a skyscraper? Suppose you need the vacant land to build another one, for example ...The most effective, cleanest, safest way to destroy a skyscraper is known as controlled demolition. The trick is to distribute explosives at key points throughout the structure. The explosives are detonated simultaneously, destroying the integrity of the steel frame at key points, such that no part of the building is supported against the force of gravity. The entire mass is pulled swiftly to earth, where gravity does the work of pounding the structure into tiny fragments of steel and concrete. The gravitational potential energy of the structure is converted smoothly and uniformly into kinetic energy, and then is available very efficiently to pulverize the fragments of the building as they impact against the unyielding earth. Controlled demolitions have a striking and characteristic appearance of smooth, flow ing collapse. As your eyes will tell you, the World Trade Center collapses looked like controlled demolitions. Here's the proof. The proof. According to the law of gravity, it is possible to calculate the time it takes for an object to fall a given distance. The equation is H=(1/2)at2, where H is the height, a is the acceleration of gravity (10 meters per second squared) and t is time in seconds. Plug in the height of the building at 1350 feet (411 meters) and we get 9 seconds. That is just about the length of time it took for the very top of the World Trade Center to fall to the street below. According to all reports, the whole thing was over in just about ten seconds. It is as if the entire building were falling straight down through thin air. As if the entire solid structure below, the strong part which had not been burned or sliced or harmed in any significant way, just disappeared into nothingness. Yet this (within a small tolerance) is what we would expect to find if there had been a"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 86 controlled demolition, because the explosions below really do leave the upper stories completely unsupported. Like the Road Runner after he runs off the edge of the cliff, the entire building pauses a moment, then goes straight down. Any kind of viscous process or friction process should have slowed the whole thing down. Like dropping a lead ball into a vat of molasses, or dropping a feather into the air, gravitational acceleration cannot achieve its full effect if it is fighting any opposing force. In the case of the World Trade Center, the intact building below should have at least braked the fall of the upper stories. This did not happen. There was no measurable friction at all. This proves controlled demolition. 27 The fires were initially intense from the fireball, but then became very low intensity or smothered. This is demonstrated by the numerous images of survivors from the impact and fuel burn-off that huddled near the gaping entry wounds of the aircraft, hoping and praying for rescue. Many leapt to their horrible deaths from those same openings. The F.D.N.Y. Battalion Chief Brian Dixon gave a statement after the attacks confirming the lack of flames and raging fire in WTC-1: I’m looking at the tower, at one (WTC-1), and two (WTC-2) is set back. Obviously the south one is set back farther. I don’t recall a lot of flame from that vantage point, from looking up from the west side of West Street. People were standing out there. A lot of smoke drifting up, a lot of dark black smoke drifting up on tower one from the lowest floor of fire, obscuring the top somewhat. I didn’t see a lot of flame coming out of windows or anything. 28 Chief Dixon claims he saw only minimal fires, with heavy black (cool) smoke, he also claims he saw survivors from his vantage point. How can they have been survived a government alleged 800°C-2000°C inferno that would have weakened code-certified steel, yet spare human flesh? How can fires level two 110-story buildings yet miraculous spare a passport from one of the alleged hijackers with a state of almost pristine condition to rival the 1963 Kennedy ‘Magic Bullet’ for all its ridiculousness? The fires were suffocating themselves out, and dark black, sooty smoke was being vented, typical of a choking and inefficient fire. The images of the gaping wounds inflicted by the aircraft did not show any red or"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 87 white hot steel glowing from raging fires. Firefighter radio communications just prior to the collapse also indicated that there was only minimal fires remaining, and that they believed they were controllable. Seven minutes before the collapse, battalion Chief Palmer is heard to say over the radio: Ladder 15, we've got two isolated pockets of fire. We should be able to knock it down with two lines. Radio that, 78th floor numerous 10-45 Code Ones. I'm still in boy stair 74th floor. No smoke or fire problems, walls are breached, so be careful. 29 Chief Palmer called for a pair of engine companies to fight the fires. The fact that veteran firefighters, among the worlds most experienced in fighting skyscraper fires, and showed no signs of fear or panic, and they had a coherent plan for fighting the fires, contradicts the official explanation of the collapses that the fires were so hot and extensive that they weakened the steel structure. These are not the words some technician running simulations after the fact, this is direct eye- witness testimony, from the grave. It is not credible that the alleged “high heat” fire was ever widespread enough or ever approached temperatures capable of weakening the steel frames and support beams in the very short of time from the impacts to the collapses, each in less than 60 minutes. 30 Additionally, the heat did not just concentrate in a few locations, it was wicked, or radiated away through the remaining steel columns, and the duration of the exposure of the steel columns, even the columns damaged and lacking protective coatings to high fire, was grossly insufficient to allow for a collapse according to the government excuse. The steel frame superstructures act like a giant heat sink and quickly dispense and diminish heat through the structure from the point of application. Let’s look at some historical examples of truly intense fires in modern steel framed high-rises that did not lead to building collapses, even fires that led to complete burn through. The short-lived fires at the World Trade Center buildings 1, 2, and 7 never came close to approaching the intensity of those seen here.

Zero. The 2005 Windsor Building Fire, Madrid Spain. The dramatic and towering 2005 fire that consumed the 32-story Windsor Building in Madrid, Spain is a very compelling counter-example to the fire caused collapse theory of 9/11. The Windsor burned for much longer, at much higher temperatures, and with more extensive concentrations of heat than the 9/11 World Trade Center fires did, and yet amazingly, it did not collapse. 31 The Windsor Building steel frame, including its steel floor joists and concrete floor pans were primarily still intact long after being exposed to red to bright canary yellow hot flame for a long and intense burn for over 18+ hours. It’s not so amazing actually, steel framed buildings do not collapse from fire. Fire color charts for steel heating indicate that the temperatures ranged from 745°C-1080°C. 32 It is also notable that the Madrid fire did not include jet fuel or other hydrocarbons as an accelerant or fuel source, yet in the absence of jet fuel, produced a much hotter, intense, and longer duration fire than what was observed in WTC-1 and WTC-2, and especially WTC-7. Examine the photos of the Windsor Building Madrid blaze, especially the burned out, and still standing, skeleton of the steel frame at the end of the blaze. The entire building is burned through and gutted.

The façade of all sides of the building suffered from heavy fire damage and displays classic widespread glass window breakage consistent with high temperature fires. This is the type of fire the 9/11 Commission and FEMA claims brought three buildings down on 9/11, when simple basic observational skills suggests otherwise, and physics absolutely confirms did not take place. The 2004 Parque Central Building Fire, Caracas,Venezuela . On Oct. 17, 2004 the 56-story, 730- foot East tower was struck by a large and aggressive fire. The intense blaze began burned for more 17 hours and spread over 26 floors, reaching the roof. 33 The fire caused nearly $250 million in damage. The building construction structure is a post tension “macro-slab” design and lacks a central core, making it weaker in comparison to the WTC. Fire control was limited by poor water pressure, sprinkler failure, and lack of fire control maintenance and lack of firefighting equipment. 34 The building floor was built to U.S. fire safety codes for a minimum 2.5 hour burn resistance. Military helicopters with water buckets had to assist in dropping water on the building. Despite the heavy damage, including some minor deflection in some steel beams, the building did not collapse. The 1991 One Meridian Plaza Fire, Philadelphia, PA. On February 23, 1991 fire gutted eight floors of the 38-story modern steel framed skyscraper. The fire burned for 18 hours.

Large shards of window glass fell from the facade, cutting through fire hoses on the ground around the building. The fire would not yield and there were increasing concerns about the stability of the structure. Fire officials called off the attack and allowed the fire to \"free burn,\" concentrating their efforts on containing the fire to this building. The building did not collapse and was eventually repaired. 35 The 1988 First Interstate Bank Building Fire, Los Angeles, CA. On May 4, 1988 a fire broke out in the First Interstate Bank building that was called the worst high-rise fire in Los Angeles history. 36 The building has a structural steel frame, applied thermal insulation and heat retardants. Steel floor plans with light-weight concrete were also in the design. The aggressive fire raged for 3½ hours and gutted and burned through 4 floors of the 64 floor tower. There was massive glass breakage, with flames lapping 30’ up the outside faces, and there was nearly complete destruction of external curtain walls, spandrel panels, and mullions. After extinguishing the fire and several month of inspection, the First Interstate fire was described as “producing no damage to the main structural members.” 37 The building construction was similar to the WTC complex, open-plan office space. The building was repaired and reoccupied months later. The 1975 World Trade Center, North Tower Fire, New York, NY . Unknown to most people, and apparently intentionally kept quiet by the mainstream media, on February 13, 1975, the World Trade Center North Tower suffered a serious and intense fire that lasted nearly 3.5 hours and was classified as a 3-alarm fire. 38 The fire destroyed the 11th floor and spread to several other floors, including areas in the central core. The fire broke windows out, and were seen pouring out of the windows of the 11th east side floor, which is indicative of"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 91 fires over 700°C. Firefighters described that the fire was especially intense when F.D.N.Y. Captain Harold Kull of Engine Co. 6 described “it was like fighting a blow torch.” 39 Despite the intense heat and duration, none of the steel floor trusses had to be replaced, despite exposure to higher heat fires of longer duration, and were more than capable to support the load of the floors until 9/11. The fires of 9/11, while they lasted, were of much less intensity due to the lack of window breakage, excepting the impact damage, and also lack of flames from the openings. No publicly available photos exist to make image comparison. Cardington Test Fires and the Broadgate Fires. In the mid-1990s British Steel and the Building Research Establishment performed a series of six experiments at Cardington to investigate the behavior of steel frame buildings. These experiments were conducted in a simulated, eight- story building. Secondary steel beams were not protected. Despite the temperature of the steel beams reaching 800-900º C (1,500-1,700º F) in three of the tests (well above the traditionally assumed critical temperature of 600º C (1,100º F), no collapse was observed in any of the six experiments). 40 As previously noted, Kevin Ryan, a scientist for Underwriter Laboratory’s said that the WTC fires only reached a maximum of 250°C (500°F) and this information fits within the Cardington test parameters for heat exposure and steel frame, and the NIST scientist confirms only minimal time exposure to the fire, it does not seem plausible that fire caused a catastrophic cascade alone. Something else was a triggering event after the impacts and after the brief fires. The fire at Broadgate showed that this (runaway failure) didn't actually happen in a real structure. Subsequently, six full-scale fire tests on a real composite frame structure at Cardington showed that despite large deflections of structural members affected by fire, runaway type failures did not occur in real frame structures when subjected to realistic fires in a variety of compartments. So beams and columns that fail when tested according to ASTM E119 or (BS 476) do not fail when they are part of a larger (composite steel frame) structure, when"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 92 South Tower WTC-2 onl y half dama g e d – heav y smoke with little visible fire subjected to the same conditions. In fact, experiments done in Britain to test this exact hypothesis, experienced no runaway failure at all. The Broadgate Phase 8 fire is probably the most notable. This accidental fire happened during the Construction phase when the steel frame was only partially fire protected. Despite very high temperatures during the fully developed phase of the fire and considerable deflections in the composite slab there was no collapse. This initiated construction of an 8-storey composite steel frame at Building Research Establishment's (BRE) large scale test facility in Cardington. Six fire tests were conducted, of varying size and configuration, to observe and ultimately explain why composite steel-framed structures adopt very large deflections during a fire but do not collapse. The Cardington frame fire tests and subsequent numerical modeling has shown that multi-storey steel-frame structures survive compartment fires when all the steel beams are unprotected, despite temperatures in the steel of > 1000°C. The WTC South Tower . The South Tower was the second of the WTC buildings hit in the attacks, yet it was the first one to fall, which is remarkable in itself. The South Tower was hit at 9:03 AM and collapsed at 9:59 AM, a total of 56 minutes. According to NIST scientific analysis, the low flashpoint fuel of the Boeing 767 burned off after at most 5-10 minutes. The aircraft hit off-center to the tower and most of the fuel load was ignited exterior of the building at impact in a dramatic fireball. If you notice from the photo, the floors were only damaged on one-half of the entire structure. The WTC building hit the last, with the least amount of fuel, and with less structural damage, fell first within 55 minutes. That is amazing in of itself. If the building was going to collapse according to the visible damage, the obvious"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 93 weakest areas of the structure, you would have had the disastrous leaning collapse of the towers, not a perfect symmetrical vertical collapse into its own footprint. But in fact, there was a leaning of the top 20 floors of the tower, of about 20° over the vertical axis of the building. As this section is now over open air, it should have come down independently from the remaining tower and left a gigantic cube-shaped pile of wreckage on the street below. 41 But none was found; it broke apart and disintegrated in mid-air from unexplained forces. Can someone explain to me the mechanism that can accomplish that feat that does not include high explosives in the scenario? To illustrate this, consider an example of how a large tree is felled. The lumberjack makes a notch cut in the tree and it tips and falls in the direction of least resistance, and the giant tree doesn’t usually break apart in mid-air. For the South Tower, the weakest area would have been the off-center impact area of the stricken superstructure, and led to an asymmetrical collapse. The weight of the upper floors, according to the official theory, should have caused a leaning collapse, not the vertical telescoping that was observed. The leaning collapse would have been event more destructive as debris would have rained down on a wider area and struck more buildings. The only known mechanism that allows for a near perfect vertical and symmetrical 42 collapse is computer controlled demolition. Even damaged caused by earthquakes is not as precise as what happened on 9/11 with the buildings. The WTC Towers Were Built with Robust Building Designs. Frank DiMartini, the Manager of WTC Construction and Project Management said that the design of the Towers were to be able to withstand multiple strikes from a 707, then the largest aircraft at the time. He stated in an interview that: Top floors of WTC-2 leanin g over the center axis almost 20° - notice the blast wave encircling the building"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 94 The building was designed to have a fully loaded 707 crash into it. That [Boeing 707] was the largest plane at the time. I believe that the building could probably sustain multiple impacts of jet liners because this structure is like the mosquito netting on your screen door - this intense grid - and the plane is just a pencil puncturing that screen netting. It really does nothing to the screen netting. 43 Morgan Reynolds, Ph.D., a chief economist in the Department of Labor during President George W. Bush’s first term writes about the incredibly redundant over over-designed and over-engineered construction of the Twin Towers. He writes: We know that the structural core and its steel was incredibly strong (claimed 600% redundancy) making it unlikely that the core was \"severely\" damaged at impact. There were 47 core columns connected to each other by steel beams within an overall rectangular core floor area of approximately 87 feet x 137 feet (26.5 m x 41.8 m). Each column had a rectangular cross section of approximately 36\" x 14\" at the base (90 cm x 36 cm) with steel 4\" thick all around (100 mm), tapering to ¼\" (6 mm) thickness at the top. Each floor was also extremely strong, a grid of steel, contrary to claims of a lightweight \"truss\" system. 44 There is evidence that the Twin Towers were designed with an even greater measure of reserve strength than typical large buildings. According to the calculations of engineers who worked on the Towers' design, all the columns on one side of a Tower could be cut, as well as the two corners and some of the columns on each adjacent side, and the building would still be strong enough to withstand a 100-mile-per-hour wind. 45 As with all high rises, the building was over-engineered and should have survived the aircraft impacts and fuel fireballs. Dr. David Ray Griffin points out that the 9/11 Commission underplayed or omitted the absolutely massive 47 core columns when it presented its report. The 9/11 Commission characterized the core of the towers as “hollow.” Tucked away in the endnotes of the Official Report, the 9/11 Commission writes: “In addition,"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 95 This ima g e from the 2003 9/11 documentary Up From Zero shows the base of a WTC core column, whose dimensions, minus the four flan g es, are apparentl y 52 b y 22 inches, wit h walls at least 5 inches thick. the outside of each tower was covered by a frame of 14-inch-wide steel columns; the centers of the steel columns were 40 inches apart. These exterior walls bore most of the weight of the building. The interior core of the buildings was a hollow steel shaft, in which elevators and stairwells were grouped.” 46 That is a complete and total fabrication. Not only does the Commission misrepresent the significance of the columns, they incorrectly claim that the exterior walls were the primary weight bearing structure. The reality is in direct contradiction to the claims of the Commission. Look at the close-up of the columns. Those are not flimsy erector sets. Those were incredibly massive, 55”x52” and 5-inch thick steel columns that ran from the bedrock all the way up to the top of the Towers and by failing to mention them and accurately describe them, the Commission is covering up their existence, they have to – the lie of the official story could not hold up if they accurately presented the core columns. In the Report, the columns are only mentioned in two instances and only in the endnotes. Not exactly a prominent position for a Commission that claimed “to provide the fullest possible account of the events surrounding 9/11.” If the Commission is distorting, or even more seriously, covering up this critical information, what else are they distorting? Griffin, calling the 9/11 Commission Report a 571-page Lie, writes: Each collapse was also total, with each 110-story building collapsing into a pile of rubble only a few stories high. How such a total collapse could occur---if explosives were not used---is a complete mystery, because the core of each tower consisted of 47 massive steel columns. The main explanation for the collapse is a pancake theory, according to which the floors above the hole created by the plane’s impact broke loose from the columns and fell on the floor below, thereby"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 96 Demolition char g e firin g below the collapse starting a chain reaction. But if this is what happened, the core columns would have still been sticking a thousand feet into the air. The Commission handled this problem by simply denying the existence of these core columns, saying: “The interior core of the buildings was a hollow steel shaft.” 47 Free Fall Speed of Collapse and Demolition Squibs In condemning video footage, high velocity jets of firing demolition squibs 48 can be seen erupting on the right side, and also from the direct front view of the camera. 49 The falling of the building’s WTC 1-2 are nearly at vacuum free-fall speed, collapsing at 9 to 10 seconds, with nothing impeding the fall of thousands of tons of steel and concrete other than air. 50 According to basic high school physics books, it takes more than 9 seconds to free-fall from the towers height, in a vacuum; it takes an additional 1-3 seconds longer than that in an atmosphere near sea level due to air resistance. The government scenario is physically impossible to proceed through undamaged lower floors unless high explosive demolition and cutting of the supporting steel frame and columns simultaneously is allowed for in the formula. Dr. Morgan Reynolds says: There is special import in the fact of free-fall collapse...if only because everyone agrees that the towers fell at free-fall speed. This makes pancake collapse with one floor progressively falling onto the floor below an unattractive explanation. Progressive pancaking cannot happen at free-fall speed (\"g\" or 9.8 m/s2). Free- fall would require \"pulling\" or removing obstacles below before they could impede (slow) the acceleration of falling objects from above. Sequenced explosions, on the other hand, explain why the lower floors did not interfere with the progress of the falling objects above. The pancake theory fails this test. 51 Stephen E. Jones, a 20 year physicist and on the faculty of Brigham Young University, recently submitted a peer-reviewed article, “Why Indeed Did the WTC Buildings Collapse,” countering the government’s contention that fire brought the World Trade Center buildings down. This easy to read paper by Prof. Jones"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 97 should be read in its entirety for the full breadth of his arguments. He writes regarding the free-fall nature of the building collapses: The rapid fall of the Towers and WTC7 has been analyzed by several engineers/scientists ( http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/proofs/speed.html ; Griffin, 2004, chapter 2). The roof of WTC 7 (students and I are observing the southwest corner) falls to earth in less than 6.6 seconds, while an object dropped from the roof would hit the ground in 6.0 seconds. This follows from t = (2H/g) 1/2 . Likewise, the Towers fall very rapidly to the ground, with the upper part falling nearly as rapidly as ejected debris which provide free-fall references ( http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/proofs/speed.html ; Griffin, 2004, chapter 2). Where is the delay that must be expected due to conservation of momentum – one of the foundational Laws of Physics? That is, as upper-falling floors strike lower floors – and intact steel support columns – the fall must be significantly impeded by the impacted mass. If the central support columns remained standing, then the effective resistive mass would be less, but this is not the case – somehow the enormous support columns failed/disintegrated along with the falling floor pans. How do the upper floors fall so quickly then, and still conserve momentum in the collapsing buildings? The contradiction is ignored by FEMA, NIST and 9-11 Commission reports where conservation of momentum and the fall times were not analyzed. The paradox is easily resolved by the explosive demolition hypothesis, whereby explosives quickly remove lower-floor material including steel support columns and allow near free-fall-speed collapses (Harris, 2000) 52 Notice the uniform rows high velocity jets appearing on the images, wrapping along both sides of the building. Those are explosives detonating, not released potential energy from gravity. The building has very little downward motion in this frame, if any. The radio antenna is still visible and appears vertical. Even if you allow for the upper floor trusses Uniform row of cuttin g char g es firin g on 2 sides – Building has not begun collapse but heavy and uniform lateral discharge is present"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 98 to have collapsed from the heat damage, the remaining lower (cool and undamaged floors) would not have collapsed in the same manner at free-fall speed or with the massive conversion of concrete to dust-sized debris. The lower steel columns were unaffected by fire and should have given more resistance to the mechanical collapse, certainly greater than the 10-15 seconds it took for the entire collapse. The only method known for such a complete collapse that fits the time frame of free-fall speed of the top to bottom collapse, and the massive dust cloud dispersal pattern, is from high powered commercial demolition or military charges. Teresa Veliz, a survivor from the 47 th floor of the first tower struck, the North Tower, reported secondary explosives being detonated and violent shaking of the building after Flight 11 hit as she was evacuating the building. She said: “But I didn't have much time to be upset because the building shook again, this time even more violently...There were explosions going off everywhere. I was convinced that there was bombs planted all over the place and someone was sitting at a control panel pushing detonator buttons. There was an explosion and another.” 53 NYFD firefighters also described the rapid-fire series of explosions they viewed and experienced as: “floor by floor it started popping out...it was almost as if it had detonators, as if they were planted to take down a building...boom, boom, boom, boom, boom ...all the way down” 54 as the cascade of charges were detonated. F.D.N.Y. firefighter and 9/11 hero Lou Cacchioli stated: I somehow got into the stairwell and there were more people there. When I began to try and direct down, another huge explosion like the first one hits. This one"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 99 hits about two minutes later, although it’s hard to tell, but I’m thinking, ‘Oh. My God, these bastards put bombs in here like they did in 1993! 55 [My emphasis ] Another F.D.N.Y. firefighter repeated the claims of explosives detonating in a rhythmic series. Firefight Edward Cachia reported to his superiors after the attacks in the recently released interviews: As I’m standing with my officer, the people are continuing to jump. Ganci is still on the radio trying desperately to get some information concerning, this third plane in the air. As my officer and I were looking at the south tower, it just gave. It actually gave at a lower floor, not the floor where the plane hit, because we originally had thought there was like an internal detonation explosives because it went in succession, boom, boom, boom, boom, and then the tower came down. With that everybody was just stunned for a second or two, looking at the tower coming down. Then everybody started to turn towards the garage. That was it. We were just kind of blown into the garage with all the dust and the debris and material from the building. It came up rapidly right up the street. 56 [My emphasis] Yet more firefighters and command officers reported in statements after the attacks that they witnessed explosive flashes, or heard sequenced and rhythmic detonations, or bombs. Captain Karin Deshore mentions witnessing low level flashes of light, and also sequenced explosions following the light flashes immediately prior to the building collapse: Somewhere around the middle of the World Trade Center there was this orange and red flash coming out. Initially it was just one flash. Then this flash just kept popping all the way around the building and that building had started to explode. The popping sound, and with each popping sound it was initially an orange and then a red flash came out of the building on both sides as far as I could see. These popping sound and the explosions were getting bigger going both up and down and then all around the building. I went inside and told everybody that other building or there was an explosion occurring up there and I said I think we have another major explosion. 57 [My emphasis] "},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 100 New York Firefighter and Assistant Fire Commissioner Gregory Stephen also related that he, and another firefighter, witnessed low-level flashes that were consistent with controlled demolition. He said in his post-9/11 interview: We both for whatever reason - again, I don't know how valid this is with everything that was going on at that particular point in time, but for some reason I thought that when I looked in the direction of the Trade Center before it came down, before No. 2 came down, that I saw low-level flashes. In my conversation with Lieutenant Evangelista, never mentioning this to him, he questioned me and asked me if I saw low-level flashes in front of the building, and I agreed with him because I thought -- at that time I didn't know what it was. I mean, it could have been as a result of the building collapsing, things exploding, but I saw a flash , flash, flash and then it looked like the building came down. Q. Was that on the lower level of the building or up where the fire was? A. No, the lower level of the building. You know like when they demolish a building, how when they blow up a building, when it falls down? That's what I thought I saw. And I didn't broach the topic to him, but he asked me. He said I don't know if I'm crazy, but I just wanted to ask you because you were standing right next to me. He said did you see anything by the building? And I said what do you mean by see anything? He said did you see any flashes? I said, yes, well, I thought it was just me. He said no, I saw them, too . 58 [My emphasis] Compare the firefighter and officer statements with the video from Controlled Demolition’s own website, and others from the internet, of actual professional demolitions they have orchestrated and the flashes from the frame cutting charges, also notice the rhythmic gunshot-like sounds from the cutting charges that firefighters and others also mentioned in their interviews: http://www.controlled-demolition.com/images/client/jlhudson.mpg http://www.controlled-demolition.com/images/client/kingdome.mpg http://wcpo.com/specials/2002/implosion/videoclips.html http://www.mediabum.com/images/building_demolition.wmv http://www.mnstate.edu/implosion/implosion.mov http://www.fpm.iastate.edu/Knapp-Storms/video3.wmv http://mfile.akamai.com/12929/wmv/vod.ibsys.com/2005/0626/4652893.200k.asx http://www-cgi.cnn.com/US/Newsbriefs/9511/11-07/implosion.mov "},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 101 http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/mmedia/metro/121804-1v.htm http://www.edgewoodhospital.com/video/edgedemolition.wmv http://www.memphisbioworks.org/newsroom_2005_0508_implosion- video.php?video=1 http://www.memphisbioworks.org/newsroom_2005_0508_implosion- video.php?video=2 http://www.phillyblast.com/southwrk.mpg http://offo2.epa.state.oh.us/FERNALD/Remediation/D&D/avi/PL4_SMAL.AVI http://mfile.akamai.com/12905/wmv/vod.ibsys.com/2005/0523/4519106.200k.asx And mysterious rapid flashes can be seen in NBC footage as the South Tower collapses: http://www.plaguepuppy.net/public_html/collapse%20update/-- =Close-up%20of%20south%20tower%20collapse.mpg For a compilation of their corroborating statements released by the F.D.N.Y after court order to the 9/11 firefighter families on August 15th, 2005, see the addendum, with hyperlinks to their full statements.

The official theories totally defy the known physics and engineering of how buildings collapse according to the progressive or “pancake theory.” Numerous demolition cutting squibs are seen discharging below the main thrusts of the collapse in the in video footage as the buildings are imploded. 9/11 researcher Jeff King indicated the absurdity of gravity collapse contributing to the powdering of the concrete, something other than potential energy caused the effects witnessed and by deduction, the collapses: How much very fine concrete dust is ejected from the top of the building very early in the collapse. Since it should at most be accelerating under gravity at 32 feet per second, things would be actually moving quite slowly at first...It is very hard to imagine a physical mechanism to generate that much dust with concrete slabs bumping into each at 20 to 30 mph. 59 Massive amounts of heavy tonnage materials, and evenly sized steel columns are seen being violently discharged along a horizontal axis which can only be accomplished by high explosives because the latent potential mechanical/gravity energy of a building collapse is grossly insufficient to propel heavy steel support beams laterally or sideways hundreds of feet. New York Fire Department Chief Frank Cruthers of Citywide Tour Command, an on-location eyewitness to the collapses, said in statements given after 9/11: There were some units there, along with a Battalion Chief and I gave them some instructions as to what to try to do. And while I was still in that immediate area, the south tower, 2 World Trade Center, there was what appeared to be at first an explosion. It appeared at the very top, simultaneously from all four sides, materials shot out horizontally. And then there seemed to be a momentary delay before you could see the beginning of the collapse.

In the process of the collapses, especially at the very beginning of the collapse, the concrete that was poured into floor pans was rendered to sub-100 micron sized dust 61 (the consistency of talcum powder) before it reached the ground. Numerous published photos of the debris taken after the collapses on the ground show the dust coating everything for many square blocks, but very little large blocks of concrete. It is impossible according to known physics and thermodynamics for concrete to be reduced to dust of this size before impacting the ground and from mechanical collapse energy release alone. The concrete was rendered to dust while it was still in the air, even at the beginning of the collapse, where there was only a small amount of initial speed (maximum of 15-25 mph) and energy to contribute to the progressive collapse. Only the application of commercial or military-grade high explosives can explain this effect and result. No amount of mechanical or gravity energy will create powdered dust. 62 Concrete only powders when exposed to a high energy compression wave from commercial high explosive demolitions or military explosives, not from free fall or “pancake collapse.” A concrete block dropped from 1300’ (the height of WTC-1 and WTC-2) would be broken, crushed, and fractured, and in many small pieces, but it would not be powdered.

Since the pressure in the wave of deformation far exceeds the yield strength of the concrete (about 3,500 pounds per square inch) by a factor of approximately 300, the concrete is turned into granular sand and dust until the wave dissipates to below the yield strength of the concrete. 64 WTC Basement Explosions . Multiple and simultaneous explosions were witnessed and felt in the subbasements of the WTC 1 and 2 buildings by numerous credible people, including WTC maintenance employees and 9/11 hero William Rodriguez and Jose Sanchez when the aircraft hit the buildings, strongly contradicting the official story. 65 Rodriguez says he felt explosions below him before he felt the impact vibration of the aircraft collision. He was located on sub-basement 1 of the North Tower. Rodriguez says: When I heard the sound of the explosion, the floor beneath my feet vibrated, the walls started cracking and it everything started shaking, Seconds after the first massive explosion below in the basement still rattled the floor, I hear another explosion from way above, \" said Rodriguez. \"Although I was unaware at the time, this was the airplane hitting the tower, it occurred moments after the first explosion. I know there were explosives placed below the trade center. I helped a man to safety who is living proof, living proof [that] the government story is a lie and a cover-up. 66 William Rodriguez"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 105 Michael Pecoraro, a World Trade Center Stationary Engineer, a hero who rescued and saved several hundred people from death or injury, was working on 9/11 on the 6th subbasement floor when the first plane hit the tower. He recounted how multiple explosions rocked the floors underneath street level. He noticed the room he was working in was filling with white smoke that smelled of kerosene. He and a co-worker ascended the stairs to a small machine shop, and found the room in ruins, with heavy tonnage equipment destroyed. From an article in Chief Engineer, he offered this recollection: There was nothing but rubble. We’re talking about a 50-ton hydraulic press – gone! You could stand here,” he said, “and two inches over you couldn’t breathe. We couldn’t see through the smoke so we started screaming.” But there was still no answer. The two made their way to the parking garage, but found that it, too, was gone. “There were no walls, there was rubble on the floor, and you can’t see anything” he said. They decided to ascend two more levels to the building’s lobby. 67 As they ascended to the B Level, one floor above, they were astonished to see a steel and concrete fire door that weighed about 300 pounds, wrinkled up “like a piece of aluminum foil” and lying on the floor. “They got us again,” Mike told his co-worker, referring to the terrorist attack at the center in 1993. Having been through that bombing, Mike recalled seeing similar things happen to the building’s structure. He was convinced a bomb had gone off in the building. He relayed his experience when reaching the damage in the lobby: When I walked out into the lobby, it was incredible...The whole lobby was soot and black, elevator doors were missing. The marble was missing off some of the walls. 20-foot section of marble, 20 by 10 foot sections of marble, gone from the walls. The west windows were all gone. They were missing. These are tremendous windows. They were just gone. Broken glass everywhere, the revolving doors were all broken and their glass was gone. Every sprinkler head was going off. I am thinking to myself, how are these sprinkler heads going off? It takes a lot of heat to set off a sprinkler head. It never dawned on me that there was a giant fireball that came through the air of the lobby. 68 Michael Pecoraro"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 106 Note that he was underground, below street level, when these explosions were felt. He later explains that he thought jet-fuel leaked down from the impacts, ignited to explosive combustion and caused the damage in the lobby. However, this last statement poses some problems. The scientific rule of Occam’s Razor states that given two equally predictive explanations for an event, choose the simpler. For the official government theory, the fuel of the impacted airplanes that was not consumed in the fireballs had to find its way hundreds of feet and through 70-80 non-damaged floors or elevator shafts to the sub-basement – nearly instantaneously to the impacts, and then be in sufficient quantity and in optimal fuel-air ratio and an ignition source to cause massive explosions versus the competing hypothesis that pre-positioned explosives caused the damage that was observed in the lower levels and in the lobby. Of the two competing theories, pre-positioned explosives best satisfies Occam’s Razor. The fuel cannot be in two places at the same time, and if the quantity of fuel is divided from the main floors of damage, then there clearly isn’t enough fuel to feed the allegedly raging, and steel weakening inferno there. Firefighter Testimony of Secondary Explosions . In the documentary video 9/11 Loose Change by Dylan Avery, 69 many news reports and credible eyewitness testimony indicated several follow-up rounds of explosions that occurred within the towers after the impacts and just prior to the building collapses. These statements provide excellent first hand agreement to the physics of the collapses as being consistent with controlled demolition. Additional statements from firefighters on 9/11 were taken and printed in the New York Times after being suppressed by the city of New York. These statements are peppered with comments regarding witnessing and experiencing the sounds of secondary explosions, low-level flashes, blasts, and repetitive sounds like gunshots, which is typical for the column cutting shaped charges to sound"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 107 like when fired. These statements can be found in the addendum at the end of this paper. Many New York firefighters also gave testimony in video and in radio broadcasts that they also felt secondary explosions occurring while they were conducting rescue operations. 70 In recently released and heavily redacted transcripts of radio communications, New York Firefighter Kirk Long, of Engine 1 reported in that he heard the North Tower shake and “thought a bomb had gone off in the lower basement.” MSNBC originally had that statement posted on its website, but later quietly removed the bombing reference. 71 F.D.N.Y. Deputy-Chief, Division 1 responded to the North Tower lobby and discovered: When we entered the lobby, there was a lot of damage in the lobby, broken glass, tiles dislodged and laying on the floor, you know, the decorative panels all around the walls. But it was rather calm in the lobby. Chief Pfeifer was in control. We responded in. We tried to gain control of the building systems, meaning the communications systems, the elevators. None of the building systems were working. The elevators were all out of service. The communication lines were not working. 72 Many responding F.D.N.Y. firefighters also reported hearing and feeling explosives detonating in the lower levels of the WTC. Fireman Richard Banaciski gave testimony in recently released reports about the explosions. He said: We were there, I don't know, maybe 10, 15 minutes and then I just remember there was just an explosion. It seemed like on television when they blow up these buildings. It seemed like it was going all the way around like a belt, all these explosions. Everybody just said run and we all turned around and we ran into the parking garage because that's basically where we were. Running forward would be running towards it. Not thinking that this building is coming down. We just thought there was going to be a big explosion; stuff was going to come down. 73 If there are so many witnesses who have spoken out about the secondary explosions and detonations, why haven’t more come out. New York auxiliary lieutenant firefighter Paul Isaac, Jr. says that many of his brethren and New York Police know the truth, but they have been intimidated and threatened. He says: “I"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 108 know 9-11 was an inside job. The police know it’s an inside job; and the firemen know it too...We all have to be very ca reful about how we handle it...It’s amazing how many people are afraid to talk for fear of retaliation or losing their jobs.” 74 Or worse. Logical Implications . It is highly improbable that the initial aircraft collisions would cause an instantaneous cascade of massive explosions to reach down to the sub-basement floors hundreds of feet away, separated by millions of tons of steel and concrete floors. It is also unlikely that the alleged massive runoff of jet-fuel drained instantly and ignited in a perfect air-fuel mixture down the elevator shafts as was given as a possible explanation. Liquid fuel would still have taken 15-20 seconds reach the basement levels at freefall speed with no resistance encountered in an empty elevator shaft, or from staggered elevator layouts. But elevator shafts are not empty; they contain passenger or utility cars and would have slowed the fall of fuel to the lower levels. As was indicated earlier, most of the jet-fuel was consumed upon impact in the widely witnessed and filmed exterior fireballs. Experts have indicated that the jet- fuel only lasted 10-15 minutes of burn time due to its low flash point 75 , it ether burned rapidly, or it evaporated into the air. If significantly less Jet-A fuel was available on the damaged impact floors to feed the fires because of a drainage of an unknown volume of liquid fuel to the sub-basements, it is thereby unlikely that the remaining jet-fuel on the upper floors could have ever caused high temperatures to build in such a very short period of time (less than 1 hour for each tower) or that those modest fires could weaken or melt steel, or drain to the lower floors and sub-basement floors, as the government contends. Burning fuel cannot be at two places at the same time. It is also clear from 100 years of history, and countless high rise fires that the standard contents of a high rise office building: building materials, furniture, papers, carpeting, plastics, et al, are not enough to cause buildings to spontaneously collapse and cause concrete to"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 109 pulverize to the consistency of flour and for steel to shred. Only high explosives can meet the requirements for those phenomena. Furthermore, since the towers were anchored at the base to the bedrock, the shaking caused by the crash would have been greatest close to the crash site, getting progressively weaker as it approached the rigid attachment at the bottom. Yet the underground damage he describes can not have been the result of a mere shaking - nothing short of an explosion could reduce the contents of a machine shop to rubble, prior to the building collapses. Mr. Pecoraro said that he \"later learned\" that there had been an explosion caused by fuel pouring down an elevator shaft, but the lobby shows none of the soot or fuel residue we would expect from such an explosion. Instead we see blown-out windows and a fine dry dust covering the entire lobby, very much the signature of high order explosives, especially composition C-4. Similar damage to the parking garages and sub-basements, which is also borne out by other witness statements, can only be explained by pre-placed explosive charges that were detonated at the moment of the plane's impact. The only plausible explanation to reconcile both the credible witness testimony and also the physical evidence is pre-positioned high-explosive devices. Explosions were felt, heard, and seen by eyewitnesses and also ear-witnesses, in the towers themselves, in the basement floors or the towers, and also on the streets. Witnesses of secondary explosives ranged in expert quality from office workers and building custodial staff, to firefighters, to command officers of the firefighters. These are very credible and independent witnesses, with nothing to gain in standing against the government explanation. Despite all that they lost on 9/11, friends, family, co-workers, these witnesses are risking even more by making this information known to the public, often in danger to themselves or in violation of FBI-imposed gag-orders. Examine the statements made by firefighters and their commanding officers and their belief of explosives being fired off. The sounds and visuals they describe are of controlled demolition. This"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 110 is very similar to the attack strategy on the WTC on Feb. 26, 1993 when truck bombs were placed in the parking garages of the buildings. In response to this attack, William Rodriguez has filed a civil RICO action lawsuit against President Bush and other high level members of his administration based upon prior know- ledge of 9/11; knowingly failing to act, prevent or warn of 9/11; and the ongoing obstruction of justice by covering up the truth of 9/11; all in violation of the laws of the United States. 76 In a frighteningly candid statement, the President of Controlled Demolition, Inc., Mark Loizeaux says: “If I were to bring the towers down, I would put explosives in the basement to get the weight of the building to help collapse the structure.” 77 The world is a dangerous place to live; not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don't do anything about it. ~ Albert Einstein Never in modern history has an event of such cataclysmic significance been shrouded in such mystery. So many of the key facts remain unexplained on any plausible basis, and so many of the key actors have put forward contradictory accounts, only to be forced to retract or cover-up later.

I think I am entitled. You want answers? I think I deserve the truth. YOU CAN’T HANDLE THE TRUTH! ~ Colonel Nathan Jessup, A Few Good Men The Pentagon is the headquarters for the entire U.S. military, and is among the most heavily defended military installations in the world with: multiple on-site ground-to- air missile defense batteries with “Friend or Foe” identification, several layers of civilian and military radar coverage, and a nearby Air Force base with 2 fighter squadrons. The Pentagon and those in command allowed a known air threat to attack it and hit it, just coincidentally on its recently blast reinforced and least populated side. There are several arguments to contradict the official story and they raise several important and disturbing questions. The Incompetent Pilot . The alleged pilots, among them a Saudi named Hani Hanjour, had never before flown a jet aircraft, lacked an instrument rating, barely spoke the English language, was considered so incompetent by his flight trainers that he was denied the ability to rent a simple single engine propeller aircraft, and lastly, flight instructors refused to train or fly with him. He could barely drive an automobile. 1 This poorly-rated, inexperienced, and basic pilot trainee, according to the official version, allegedly performed a high G-Force maneuver of such extreme difficulty that most experienced and professional commercial airline pilots and military Pentagon held simulated attack drills in 2000 – Aircraft used as weapons 9/11 Pilot Hani Hanjour"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 113 Boeing 767 cockpit Basic flight single engine controls for beginners instruction pilots would have had difficulty executing. The maneuver Hanjour miraculously performed was a 270° spiral turn at 600 mph while also executing a descent of 7000 feet in 2 minutes performed in a multi- engine commercial 100 ton Boeing 757-200 jet aircraft flying in final approach to impact the Pentagon just inches off the ground. It was allegedly his FIRST TIME at the controls of such an aircraft. Maybe it was his training at the U.S. Pensacola Naval Air Station that gave him such instant expertise. 2 That is the U.S. Navy facility where many of our naval aviators receive their initial flight training. This poorly educated Saudi, barely speaking English, and barely capable of driving a car, pulled off the flight of a Top Gun pilot? It is not even remotely credible that this person was the pilot for the Pentagon attack. Could a medical student gain experience and perform a flawless open heart surgery just by playing a PC simulator or studying manuals? Could someone barely able to make coherent sandcastles build the San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge on his first attempt? John Lear, pilot extraordinaire, and son of the famous Learjet inventor, is extremely qualified 3 to speak on the subject of piloting and flight operations. He gave a radio interview where he said that it is virtually impossible that a ragtag crew could have flown the aircraft that struck the Pentagon, or the WTC buildings, they would have had to have received specialized training, including time of simulator time on actual industry 757 simulators, which are very limited and very controlled. He described the degree of difficulty in the flight when he said in 2003: We were tricked into thinking that Osama was responsible for 9/11, but to get a proper perspective on who 'did' the World Trade Center...uh...you have to"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 114 understand what a magnificent feat of airmanship this was. It was 'disastrous' and was horrible for this country, but... this was not accomplished by some guys who went to Florida and got some instructions on a Cessna or a Piper. And this was not accomplished by somebody who had a right seat [copilot] on a 727. In addition to that, hitting the Trade Center was a feat. But hitting the Pentagon was even more of a feat, because when you are going that fast there is a tremendous amount of air creating this lift and as you head towards the ground, that air reacts against the wing and pushes you up, so whoever... whoever hit that... trained to hit the Pentagon at the 3rd story was highly trained because when he came towards the ground... there was a tremendous amount of lift and you would have to trim forward and push with an incredible amount of strength to not be pushed up and over the Pentagon to hit the 3rd story. You talk to any... pilot... who knows 'anything' about this... and that was... that was, that was a feat of airmanship! With the benefit with 19,000 hours in all the airplanes I've flown including air races... the Douglas B-26... I doubt that I could have done that the 1st time...” Therein lies the problem. Because they 'certainly' couldn't waltz into any airline in the United States and get that kind of time. I mean, most of the airliners...uh... airlines... who have 757's, use them 24 hours a day... and they certainly aren't in the habit of granting ... uh... to unauthorized people, like somebody going in there and saying \"hey, give me 1500 hours of time!\" It’s just not going to happen. They would have to find another 757 elsewhere in the world and if you look around in the Middle-East and there's certainly none there, because... at least...not in any Arab country...because, they have airbuses...strictly airbuses from France. They would have to find some place else....that has a 757 simulator. 4 Several other former commercial and military pilots have come out speaking against the claim that these hijackers could have piloted the planes on 9/11. 5 The government’s claim that these amateur – and that’s being generous, pilots could have flown these highly technical aircraft over long distances under duress of maintaining control of the passenger cabins with box-cutters, flying without instrument training, or advanced navigational skills is very flimsy. "},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 115 Suppressed Pentagon Video Evidence . Video footage of the attack is being totally suppressed except for cherry- picked and edited snippets consisting of 5-6 frames from a single poorly positioned camera that are very blurry and inconclusive as to the content. None of the frames of film released show definitively a 100-ton Boeing 757 in the view. In the immediate vicinity of the Pentagon, there were multiple camera positions on the roof that survived the attack, but that footage is being tightly suppressed. Furthermore, it is well known that the FBI has in its toolbox, highly sophisticated image enhancement programs, but it failed to apply them to the released footage. Among it’s first reactions in response to the attack on the Pentagon, the FBI immediately reacted by seizing all area video footage from nearby businesses such as the nearby Sheraton hotel, the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) highway cameras, and the Pentagon’s own exclusive and on-property CITGO gasoline station, and then tampering with the witnesses telling what they did or did not see and ordering them to silence under the blanket excuse of National Security. The U.S. government is determined to withhold these videos for what purpose? It is not acting like a party with nothing to hide. Is this how a supposedly democratic government predicted on transparency in an investigation operates? This is the same FBI that had bungled nearly every major case to come across its desks in the last 20 years. Color of impact and explosion differs from aircraft impacts at the WTC buildings. Why? White streak of smoke or exhaust, but no sight of a 100 ton Boeing 757. Where is it?"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 116 If the video captured by the camera seized by the FBI supported the U.S. posit- ion then the footage would be more fully released and with more detail and clarity. The government is fully aware that many people doubt the official version of the story and could easily put those concerns to rest by releasing more film, or the films of the local Sheraton Hotel, Virginia VDOT highway camera videos, or the gasoline station close to the Pentagon Apparently, from the suspicious manner of the government’s actions, the video does not tend to support the official story, and hence is suppressed. Be honest with yourself, is the government acting like a guilty party with something to hide? If you determine that it is hiding something, then you reasonably have to ask then what could it be hiding that is so bad for its stated official position that would justify the secrecy? You already know the answer without even requiring the evidence. The world desperately awaits the leak of the equivalent of the JFK Zapruder 6 film for 9/11. Andrews Air Force Base (AFB) Did Not Respond . Finally, the home base of Air Force One, the President’s pair of nuclear hardened Boeing 747-200B’s, has two squadrons of fighters that were not used to defend Washington D.C. until it was too late. Why? Andrews Air Force Base (AFB) is only about 10 miles away from the Pentagon and downtown Washington, D.C. 7 Instead of scrambling directly from Andrews AFB, fighters were scrambled from bases 129 miles away at Langley, Virginia. Furthermore, the attack and collision was allowed nearly 40 minutes AFTER it was widely known that hijacked aircraft were being used as weapons and after both WTC-1 & 2 collisions. 8 • Official Denial of Fighter Squadrons: It was originally claimed that there weren’t fighter aircraft assigned to Andrews AFB. At the same time, media sources were also claiming that fighters were assigned to Andrews AFB, but that no intercepts were scrambled because the fighters were not on alert. NORAD commander Major General Larry Arnold has said, \"We [didn't] have any aircraft on alert at Andrews.\" 9 "},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 117 • Truth Exposed: Andrews AFB, home of Air Force One, hosts two 'combat- ready' squadrons: the 121st Fighter Squadron (F-16 Falcons) of the 113th Fighter wing (D.C. Air National Guard), and the 321st Marine Fighter Attack Squadron (FA-18 Hornets) of the 49th Marine Air Group. 10 • Fastest Response: Scramble times for alert fighter aircraft on the deck to takeoff is approximately 2-5 minutes. The flight time to Washington from Andrews AFB is <1 minute. The Pentagon was hit 1:29 hours into the crisis. There is no possible reasonable excuse for this level of incompetence or criminally gross negligence. 11 • The Dishonorable and Shameful Cover-up: Just before 9/11, the Andrews AFB website used to directly link to the official US Air Force webpage devoted to the 113th Fighter Wing of the DC Air National Guard. The existence of those pages contradicted media and military official claims that there were no combat-ready fighter jets at Andrews. The Andrews AFB Website was taken offline sometime around 9/11, and when it came back online in November 2001, the link to these pages was broken. The pre-9/11 mission statement of the D.C. ANG had been removed, which had a statement of its mission: \"To provide combat units in the highest possible state of readiness.” 12 I don’t suspect Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda can login and access military and government servers and conceal the existence of fighter wings from the public. The military command left capable and ready fighters sitting on the Andrews AFB tarmac. The military consciously and willfully withheld locally based fighter air- craft from patrols over Washington D.C when it would have been painfully obvious that the Nation’s capitol was an active target. On its face, this smells like a cover-up! Then, Andrews AFB redesigned its website to obscure, hide, and"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 118 Admiral H. E. Kimmel relieved of command after Pearl Harbor attack downplay its local fighter wings. 13 Covering up a crime is also known as being an accessory after the fact, and is very prosecutable, just ask Richard Nixon. Think about it. Would the home airfield of Air Force One, which is the Airborne Command Headquarters and Control Aircraft of the U.S. military and primary Presidential emergency aircraft in the event of a nuclear attack, be left utterly defenseless except for transport and heavy lift aircraft escorts? Absolutely not. That argument by the U.S. is not in the least credible. The Lack of Punishment or Disciplinary Action . At least after the December 7, 1941 Japanese ”sneak” attack at Pearl Harbor, Admiral Kimmel and General Short and other officers were punished, stripped of command, reassigned, or demoted for dereliction of duty. In a stunning contrast, after 9/11, Richard Myers, then the senior Air Force General, and only empowered as the acting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs at the time, and on- duty during the crisis, was fully promoted to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States Armed Forces in October 2001. 14 This is how incompetence is rewarded? No good deed goes unpunished, no crime goes unrewarded. In fact, nobody in the U.S. military, or in the FAA, was punished or received any disciplinary action for their catastrophic failures, massive incompetence, and gross negligence in leaving Washington, D.C. and the Pentagon, without air cover and for allowing multiple attacks to succeed in hitting their targets. Not one case of criminal negligence, termination, demotion, reprimand, or administrative action. 15 Not even a slap on the wrist. Senator Mark Dayton (D-MN) publicly rebuked and General Richard M y ers, JCS-USAF"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 119 excoriated NORAD for lying to Congress, and to the American people during the 9/11 Commission hearings. Dayton said that NORAD officials: [NORAD] lied to the American people, they lied to Congress and they lied to your 9/11 commission to create a false impression of competence, communication and protection of the American people. And we can set up all the oversight possible at great additional cost to the American taxpayers and it won't be worth an Enron pension if the people responsible lie to us; if they take the records and doctor them into falsehoods, and if they get away with it. For almost three years now NORAD officials and FAA officials have been able to hide their critical failures that left this country defenseless during two of the worst hours in our history. 16 He further told Kean and Hamilton that if the commission's report is correct, President Bush \"should fire whoever at FAA, at NORAD ... betrayed their public trust by not telling us the truth.\" This lack of proper meting of discipline, even within the ranks of the military, utterly shocks the conscience. 17 To compare to other military accidents and demonstrate the shocking and patently disparate lack of punishment, in January 2005, a U.S. Navy nuclear attack submarine ran struck an unmapped mountain and was severely damaged with several casualties and one fatality. 18 The skipper of that ship was relieved of command, received a nonjudicial punishment, such as a letter of reprimand, and will never command a submarine again. His military career is over. 19 In September of 2005, and contrary to Congressional recommendations, the CIA Director Porter Goss has also prevented disciplinary action against agents responsible for 9/11 security failures, including against his predecessor George Tenet. 20 Porter Goss, just before 9/11, was meeting with Senator Bob Graham and also with 9/11 lead hijacker Mohamed Atta’s $100,000 money man, Lt. General Mahmoud Ahmad. But that’s just a coincidence, nothing to worry about. In the Bush administration, incompetence is reward with Presidential Medal’s of Freedom, more emergency powers, more budget funding, and more opportunity to violate personal freedoms; in short, the Peter Principle 21 has been perfected and maximized. "},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 120 The Military Stand-down and Simultaneous Exercises . The military was effectively neutralized from reacting by the numerous exercises being conducted simultaneously on 9/11 at the SAME TIME as the attacks, one of which actually included the scenarios of hijackings and aircraft attacking the WTC and the Pentagon – what are the odds of that being unrelated? The drills also involved inserting numerous false radar signatures into the systems. As a result, the intercepting pilots couldn’t distinguish the real targets from the exercise ghosts, unless they made visual contact. That wasted critically valuable time as the fighter pilots chased radar ghosts and effectively hobbled the air response. 22 The exercises that effectively \"stood down\" the military by the Air Force and other agencies such as FEMA were called: Vigilant Guardian (Joint Chiefs), Vigilant Warrior (NORAD), Northern Vigilance, Northern Guardian , and Tripod 2 (FEMA and New York Port Authority). Air Traffic Controller conversations were heard that indicated they were confused if the attacks were real or as part of the scheduled drills and exercises. Only one exercise, Vigilant Guardian , was discussed in the 9/11 Commission report, the others were conveniently omitted. 23 Lies are not just based on the telling blatant statement mistruths, falsehoods, or distortions, they are also considered lies if they are lies of omission, and in this case, material omission. Among the worst catagory of lie, material omission is usually found in legal terminology and often accompanies cases involving the fraud. The multiple simultaneous and matching scenario exercises provide excellent operational cover: if something goes wrong in the operation of the real attack, if there is a miscue, it can be cancelled, and any discovery of it from electronic chatter, radar displays, or other attributes, can be quickly explained away by the agency or unit conducting the operation to the subsequent inquiries or investigations, if any, as part of an ‘official’ project of training drills and exercises. It allows the open discussion and planning of the scenarios under the guise and"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 121 cover as exercises without the risk of raising suspicion from “good agents” when they hear actual participants in the operation. The overlapping exercises created the operational plausible deniability, or the “fog of war.” What \"the fog of war\" means is: war is so complex it's beyond the ability of the human mind to comprehend all the variables. Our judgment, our understanding, are not adequate. And we kill people unnecessarily.\" ~ Robert S. McNamara, former Secretary of Defense for President’s Kennedy and Johnson, The Fog of War The cabal of neoconservatives at PNAC who planned this war (Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Libby, Perle, Jeb Bush) even before W became president, knew the American people would not stand for it – unless there was “a new Pearl Harbor.” 9/11 supplied that. Our government was warned. They were warned by the Clinton Administration. They were warned by 11 other countries. And they were specifically warned by an FBI agent that one of them was planning on flying a hijacked airliner “into the World Trade Center.” They not only ignored the warnings, they made sure no fighter jets were scrambled to stop it. If they had just done nothing, and allowed normal procedures to be followed, the Twin Towers would still be standing and thousands of dead Americans would still be alive. This is not stupidity, it is TREASON ~ Dr. Robert M. Bowman, Lt. Col., USAF, ret. Fighter Pilot, Vietnam, Fmr.

To know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which canceled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them, to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim to it, to believe that democracy was impossible and that the Party was the guardian of democracy, to forget, whatever it was necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, and then promptly to forget it again, and above all, to apply the same process to the process itself -- that was the ultimate subtlety: consciously to induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed.

You only have to go as far as looking at the collapse of WTC-7 to demonstrate conclusively that the WTC complex was intentionally and criminally brought down by a pre-planned operation that had nothing to do with Al-Qaeda. The 9/11 Commission Report (as well as mainstream media and news agencies) virtually ignored and purposefully avoided and minimized discussing this building’s collapse in its “Official Report.” Out of 585 pages in the 9/11 Commission Report, the words and terms “WTC-7” or “Building 7” are not even mentioned once. 25 This 47-story building fire and collapse wasn’t considered newsworthy or photogenic enough? It is like the collapse of a 47 story building never even happened. This omission screams for WHY? The mainstream media has also avoided the controversy of the collapse of WTC-7. Why? Their deafening silence is evidence of collusion in a post event cover-up. The Accidental Confession of Demolition . In the 2002 PBS documentary titled America Rebuilds , the WTC leaseholder Larry Silverstein made a Freudian slip and said that he ordered the building \"pulled,” which is an industry term for a controlled demolition with explosives. Larry Silverstein, the WTC leaseholder stated: “I remember getting a call from the, er, fire department commander, World Trade Center Building 7"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 124 telling me that they were not sure they were gonna be able to contain the fire, and I said, \"We've had such terrible loss of life; maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it. And they made that decision to pull and we watched the building collapse.” 26 Moments later in the film, a demolition worker uses the same term “pull,” when he, in the same context, discusses triggering the implosion of the damaged WTC-6 building. Evidence of the customary usage of “pull” as an industry used term comes from the very same company that managed the clean-up of the WTC attacks, as well as coincidentally, the cleanup of the Oklahoma City Murrah Federal Building attacks, Controlled Demolition, Inc. From CDI’s corporate website, the term “pull” refers to controlled demolition. 27 An experienced demolition team cannot place charges in a burning and smoke- filled building of 47 stories, let alone in an unfamiliar structure in a few hours notice, and then have it collapse in a textbook implosion into its own footprint. It’s impossible. It’s utterly unbelievable. The charges had to be placed before hand. 28 Silverstein’s shocking (and profoundly stupid) admission was never the subject of any proper inquiry during the 9/11 Commission’s investigation, and he has not given any follow-up comment regarding it. Silverstein’s name, as the principle leaseholder for the World Trade Center Complex, appears only twice in the entire 9/11 Commission Report, and not in any reference to the admission in the documentary. 29 His admission of ordering the controlled demolition of WTC-7, under normal circumstances, should have been immediately followed up by law enforcement or by the 9/11 Commission if there truly was a thorough, “leave no stone unturned” investigation, and is by itself, solely sufficient for indictment. Why has there not been any official inquiry to this strange statement? Why haven’t the insurance companies that paid out his claim raised any questions or"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 125 done their own independent investigations? Who can leverage the insurance companies to quash an investigation of an incident of this magnitude? Is Al Qaeda capable of quashing an insurance investigation and keeping its findings secret from the public and from building engineers? At the least, this is prima facie indicative of criminal insurance fraud, in the worst-case scenario; it is evidence of a massive huge and evil conspiracy of the highest order. This evil and inadvertent confession alone should be enough to charge up the electric chair. WTC-7 Was Not Hit by any Aircraft . In the strongest contrast to the circumstances of the attacks on WTC-1 and 2, the WTC-7 building was NOT hit by an aircraft and the debris impact from WTC-1 and WTC-2 collapses was relatively minimal, especially when compared to other buildings that were closer to WTC-1 and WTC-2, yet we are expected to believe that such light damage and limited fires would be sufficient enough to bring down the 47-story steel high-rise, where none have ever collapsed before or since 9/11, let alone in the visible case of a perfect textbook implosion. Even large and powerful earthquakes and their resulting damage and fires have failed to cause a nearly perfect symmetrical collapse in modern steel-framed high rise buildings, such as what occurred on 9/11 Locational Problems . The WTC-7 building was not even on the same city block as the main WTC complex and not as close to the WTC-1 and WTC-2 as other structures (that did not collapse) were. Building 7 was approximately 300’ away from the nearest tower. 30 Other buildings closer to the WTC buildings 1 and 2, such as Bankers Trust Building, the Verizon Building, and WTC-6 received much more extensive damage, yet they did not have raging fires and did not fall. WTC-6 was the closest to the Twin Towers and received the brunt of the collapse from WTC-1, yet it did not collapse, whereas WTC-7 did. The only connection to the collapses of all 3 buildings is that they all"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 126 were owned by Silverstein Properties and were over-insured for billions of dollars, despite having low tenancy rates, just prior to the attacks. 31 WTC-7 Only Had Minimal Fires Compare the intensity of the fires from WTC-7 to the photos previously shown of the Madrid Windsor Building Fire or the other high-rise fires, and determine that the fires in WTC-7 are modest and unsubstantial. The measly fires of WTC-7, while obviously problematic, were not strong enough to bring down a 47-story steel high rise, in a perfect symmetrical and vertical collapse. There is little to no fire-caused broken glass, or other external façade damage, which is always characteristic of high intensity fires, such as in the Parque Central and Windsor fires. The color of the smoke is light gray, to almost dark black, further indicative of weak and inefficient fires. WTC-7 was a sprinklered building, concrete floorpan design, compartmentalized with fireproofing materials such as gypsum, and its 24 robust central core steel columns were sprayed with Monokote ® fire insulation. The sprinkler system of WTC-7 should have been able to contain or extinguish the fires, but strangely, they were inoperative on 9/11. Examine the photographs below of the fires of WTC-7 on 9/11 and judge for yourself if they were indeed the infernos or “blazing torches” as they were described 32 and compare them to the fires that struck previous high rise buildings and shown previously in this paper. Minimal fires of World Trade Center-7"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 127 The 9/11 Commission and FEMA Still Doesn’t Know the Cause . After only spending a paltry $600,000 to study the fires and collapse associated with WTC-7, FEMA issued the following tentative and hedged conclusions about the collapse of WTC-7: “The performance of WTC 7 is of significant interest because it appears the collapse was due primarily to fire, rather than any impact damage from the collapsing towers. Prior to September 11, 2001, there was little, if any, record of fire-induced collapse of large fire-protected steel buildings...Loss of structural integrity was likely a result of weakening caused by fires on the 5th to 7th floors. The specifics of the fires in WTC 7 and how they caused the building to collapse remain unknown at this time. Although the total diesel fuel on the premises contained massive potential energy, the best hypothesis has only a low probability of occurrence. Further research, investigation, and analyses are needed to resolve this issue.” 33 That statement is basically an admission by the government agency that fires did not cause the collapse. I wonder what possibly could have caused the collapse instead of raging fires? FEMA’s volunteer engineer’s best hypothesis for the collapse of WTC-7 has only a low probability of occurring? Volunteer? The report, in regards to the WTC-7, is filled with non-committal and indecisive language, such as: “may have happened, perhaps, likely, approximately, could, possibilities, if, no physical evidence available, potential scenarios, limited information, unclear, if existed,” and also numerous recommendations for further study. In a nutshell, they are guessing, but guessing in a way that supports the predetermined conclusion, ad hoc. It also offers up the red herring of building fires that caused the collapse, but then says it doesn’t know how the fires caused it, since the fires were not severe or widespread and there were no indications that the emergency generator diesel tanks contributed any fuel or massive explosions to feed some hypothetical massive fire or cause the buildings steel support structures to uniformly and simultaneous snap at once. It also has no explanation for the massive powdering of the floor concrete that was similarly seen at the collapses of WTC-1 and WTC-2 earlier. "},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 128 Diesel fuel, even large storage tanks of diesel, does not have the explosive capability or compression wave strength to pulverize concrete to fine powder while also uniformly and simultaneously breaking steel support joints. The theory offered by FEMA about the stored diesel fuel contributing to the collapse is also discredited by FEMA’s admission that the largest tanks underneath WTC-7 were recovered intact stating: “To date, the NY State Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and DEC have recovered approximately 20,000 gallons from the other two intact 11,600-gallon underground fuel oil storage tanks at WTC 7.” 34 The status of other fuel storage areas were considered unknown. Furthermore, the other fuel storage tanks were not uniformly distributed throughout the building. If there was an explosion, it would have been localized and the demolition wave would have dissipated dramatically from the site of the explosion. They would not have broken the support columns simultaneously and uniformly. The collapse would not have been symmetrical and vertical. It would have been a lop-sided collapse. In regards to WTC-7, Physicist Stephen Jones he writes in his hypothesis that, according to the basic physical laws of Conservation of Momentum, Law of Increasing Entropy, and the Second Law of Thermodynamics, that it is, according to those unbreakable laws, impossible for the fires alone to have caused the collapses consistent with how they fell. He claims that controlled demolition is the mechanism that best satisfies the hypothesis and Occam’s Razor. He writes: WTC 7 collapsed rapidly and symmetrically -- even though fires were randomly scattered in the building. WTC 7 fell about seven hours after the Towers collapsed, even though no major persistent fires were visible. There were twenty- four huge steel support columns inside WT C 7 as well as huge trusses, arranged asymmetrically, along with approximately 57 perimeter columns. (FEMA, 2002, chapter 5.) A symmetrical collapse, as observed, evidently requires the simultaneous “pulling” of most or all of the support columns. The Second Law of Thermodynamics implies that the likelihood of complete and symmetrical collapse due to random fires as in the “official” theory is small, since asymmetrical failure is so much more likely. On the other hand, a major goal of"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 129 controlled demolition using explosives is the complete and symmetrical collapse of buildings. 35 Support for this argument is that the fires burned for seven hours, but that during the seven hours, the fire never burned through to the north side of the building. The alleged superfire burned with such intensity that it warped the steel on southern side to the point of collapse yet it failed to burn through gypsum and other firewalls. If this raging fire weakened the southern side of the building only, then collapse would not have been straight down, according to the Law of Increasing Entropy, it would have leaned over like a cut tree. 36 The photographs available of the WTC-7 do not suggest raging out of control fires. Not one photograph taken of WTC-7 on 9/11 indicates a raging fire even remotely as intense at the Windsor Building Fire of 2005, or any other major high rise fire in the last 100 years, occurred. Again, as the mountain of evidence suggests, only controlled demolition fully can account for the perfect vertical collapse of WTC-7 at free-fall speed and primarily within its own footprint. Furthermore, the participation of FEMA in the investigation calls into question the credibility and thoroughness of the study. FEMA traditionally is not a research or investigation agency. FEMA is a national disaster preparedness, response, and recovery agency. They are not tasked with processing evidence or conducting building autopsies, especially those on a disaster of the scale and magnitude of 9/11. Other federal or State of New York agencies, with more qualified building engineers and with greater resources were not assigned to study the collapse. The U.S. didn’t exactly throw this project into the laps of their best and brightest. FEMA’s investigation consisted of part-time and volunteer engineers that were never given access to the WTC-7 site, but instead had to piece together what little remaining evidence it gathered from the Fresh Kills landfill, and with a limited budget of $600,000. Most of the valuable evidentiary main column steel from the WTC-7 was quickly hauled away to foreign smelters so very little of it was available to the investigators. $600,000 of tax dollars were spent in"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 130 this sloppy investigation and that is the best explanation the government can provide? Video Evidence of Demolition Charges . In the televised video footage of the collapse of WTC-7 you can observe the classic “pinch” in the top and center of the building as the center support structure is demolished, followed by a near perfect vertical drop of the building straight down. It is a textbook example of controlled demolition. 37 Furthermore, additional condemning video footage exists of WTC-7, taken immediately prior to the collapse, solidly reveals squib charges firing in a sequence of detonations traveling up the edge of WTC-7. 38 Click the image to view the video. The cutting charges rapidly travel upwards and then smoke is seen at the top of building near an upraised area just before the building collapses. This is not a random collapse from a fire; this is classic textbook demolition work. Thomas McCarthy, a Chief in F.D.N.Y, gave a statement regarding hearing repeated and steady blasts while he was at the WTC-7. He said to an interviewer for the F.D.N.Y: A. So at that point we were a little leery about how the bridge was tied in, so no one was really going onto it, and then they were also saying 7 was going to come down. They chased everyone off the block. Q. You said before, Chief. That you heard bullets going off. Approximately how many did you hear? A. Oh, it was like it was just constant. Constant. Whatever, I guess there were packages or something, and as they heated up, they were just pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. They were going off like at a steady rate . 39 "},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 131 Do you really think those were bullets cooking off at a “constant” and “steady rate?” Or, is it more likely, given the other supporting evidence and witness statements, that it was cutting charges firing and shearing off the column supports? Comparisons to other Demolition Events . There are several common factors for determining if a building collapse is the result of a controlled demolition event. Dr. David Ray Griffin, Ph.D., writing in his book 9/11 Commission Report: Omissions and Distortions provided these identifying criteria: 1. Each WTC building collapsed at near free fall speed. 2. Each building collapsed symmetrically straight down, into its own footprint. 3. Virtually all of the building concrete was reduced to a fine dust. 4. In the case of the Twin Towers, dust was blown horizontally outward for 200 feet or more. 40 5. The collapses were total, leaving no steel columns sticking up hundreds of feet into the air. 6. Videos of the collapses reveal “demolition waves” or “confluent rows of small explosions.” 7. Most of the steel beams and supports came down in sections that were no larger than 30 feet long and broken at the joints. 41 8. Witnesses, including many F.D.N.Y. firefighters and their officers, on the ground and in the buildings reported hearing, feeling and seeing the effects of massive explosions occurring within the upper and underground levels of the buildings. 9. Each collapse was also associated with strong seismic vibrations detected on local university Richter scales that were suggestive of multiple and strong sequenced underground explosions prior to the registering of collapse energy. 42 10. Each collapse produced underground debris areas of molten steel – up to 1400°F (much hotter than a smothered, oxygen-deprived hydrocarbon-based fire could produce), the temperature aluminum melts, commonly produced by explosives – resulting in intense NASA thermal ima g e of WTC ground zero on 9/16: Red-oran g e areas are the hottest"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 132 hotspots (despite massive and sustained efforts to extinguish the subterranean fires with water and high-tech chemical methods) 43 that remained for months, despite constant water and coolant application by clean-up teams. Such prolonged hot temperatures, in oxygen starved environments are not characteristic of standard collapses, only high order explosives like C-4, 44 Czechoslovakian Simtex, or thermite account for such high residual heat. Controlled Demolitions Mark Loizeaux, president of Controlled Demolition, Inc. (CDI) of Phoenix, Maryland, was asked about the report of molten steel on the site. \"Yes,\" he said, \"hot spots of molten steel in the basements.\" These incredibly hot areas were found \"at the bottoms of the elevator shafts of the main towers, down seven [basement] levels,\" Loizeaux said. The molten steel was found \"three, four, and five weeks later, when the rubble was being removed,\" Loizeaux said. He said molten steel was also found at 7 WTC, which collapsed mysteriously in the late afternoon. 45 11. Thermite doesn’t explode rapidly like C-4 or other demolition explosives, but in its exothermic reaction, generates extremely intense high heat with temperatures reaching up to 2500°C (4500°F). 46 The mixture of aluminum powder and iron oxide burns only moderately fast, giving off heat well in excess of that required to melt steel. What’s more, it creates its own oxygen supply by consuming the iron oxide and cannot be smothered or extinguished by water. This potential cause is one of the only few things that can account for the immense heat that was being generated for days in the aftermath of the fall of both towers. 47 12. Traditional Demolition with Explosives often produces a noticeable kink, or fault line, in the building structure as the central core is demolished with cutting charges, and the outer walls fall inwards to the center, preventing or minimizing the damage to surrounding buildings. Additionally, eruptions of smoke and debris from the base of the building and streams of smoke from cutting charges are often seen in classic demolition video footage. See the collection of images on the next page.

If you conclude alternatively that WTC-7 was a controlled demolition, you then have to ask several painful questions: 1. Why were demolition explosives placed throughout the building in the first place? 2. Is it common for high rise buildings to be pre-wired to aid in their eventual destruction? If so, why weren’t the building tenants and employees informed that their workplace was wired for demolition? Are other New York buildings currently pre-wired for controlled demolition? 3. The buildings had to be wired and charges placed for demolition just immediately prior to 9/11. High explosives decompose and deteriorate over time, making them unstable and capable of premature or involuntary detonation. It would not be plausible to believe that the building could be, or ever would be, pre-wired and set to be demolished under New York building codes. Demolition techniques also use personnel called burners to precut the steel and strategically weaken the steel support beams in traditional controlled demolition prior to placing the specially designed shaped cutting charges and then the final “kicker” charges to knock out the final support for the cut beams. 4. Why did the building have to be hurriedly and needlessly demolished at Silverstein’s orders on the same day as WTC-1 and WTC-2 if they were truly unrelated events? WTC-7 tenants included at the time: Securities and Exchange Commission, the FBI, the CIA, the Secret Service, and the New York Crisis Response Command Center. The heavily damaged WTC-6 was not pulled the same day as the other building collapses. WTC-6 was officially demolished with explosives several months afterwards. Why couldn’t the demolition WTC-7 wait until search and rescue operations were complete? What was the reason for urgency to demolish WTC-7 that didn’t exist for the more heavily damaged WTC-6? What was being hidden, or destroyed? 5. Did the Twin Towers fall in a manner consistent with the collapse of WTC- 7, and if they did, is it consistent with controlled demolition based on the"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 135 evidence presented and also from the witness statements of many (heroic and beyond reproach) firefighters and also upon Silverstein’s own admission of “pulling” WTC-7? 6. How could Osama bin Laden, a prominent member of the bin Laden family, a leading Saudi family with long and close financial ties to the Bush family through Halliburton, the Carlyle Group, and others, direct an operation from a remote mountain cave in Afghanistan? 7. Why were bin Laden family members secretly shepherded out of the country during the FAA no-flight period immediately just after 9/11 without interrogating them about their brother or his possible whereabouts? 8. Why would the U.S. fabricate, or accept a fabrication, of Osama bin Laden’s alleged 9/11 confession with an obvious and poor look-alike? The phony confession Osama was shown in poor quality video, with obvious facial inconsistencies, wearing a gold ring and watch in violation of Islam, especially puritanical Wahabi Islam and also shown as right-handed, in contrast to the real Osama being left-handed. Remember, the Niger yellow-cake uranium documents were also poorly forged and accepted by the U.S. to justify the Iraq war, there is a clear pattern to U.S. behavior. 9. Can an Al-Qaeda cell consisting of a rag-tag team of 19 members wire three high-rise buildings, a total of 267 floors, with enough high explosives without being detected and no prior experience or training? While also planning and training for aircraft hijackings? 10. Would Al-Qaeda send out numerous warnings to people and companies (including two Israeli owned businesses), advising them not to fly that day or to evacuate the WTC buildings before the attacks? 11. Could Al-Qaeda effectively cause the U.S. military to stand-down, be dumbfounded, or know of the five simultaneous military drills that were occurring that morning? Could Al-Qaeda prevent the Pentagon missile batteries from engaging the aircraft while over Washington D.C.? Could Al-Qaeda prevent the White House missile batteries from engaging the attacking aircraft?"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 136 12. Could Al-Qaeda know that the ANG fighter wings from Andrews would not be used to defend Washington D.C.? Could Al-Qaeda keep the U.S. fighters from using their top speeds to intercept suspect aircraft? 13. Could Al-Qaeda schedule a large scale FEMA drill in New York City conveniently to begin on 9/12? 14. Why were all of the aircraft involved in the attacks only filled with 20% of capacity of passengers on flights that are normally filled at a minimum of 80% capacity? Why were none of the hijackers Arab names listed on the flight manifests? 15. Why was the wreckage of Flight 93 spread out over so large a distance, in some instances several miles from the impact site? Why was their so little aircraft debris at the impact site, insufficient to account for the mass of a commercial jetliner? Was Flight 93 shot down as the evidence and several eye-witness statements suggest? Why were no bodies recovered at the Flight 93 crash site? 16. Why was the United States, immediately prior to and after 9/11, meeting with Pakistani ISI spy chief Lt. General Mahmoud Ahmad, the man who had just wired Mohamed Atta $100,000? 48 On 9/11 Lt. General Ahmad, the 9/11 money man, was having breakfast with Senator Bob Graham and Rep. Porter Goss (future CIA Director), chairmen of the Senate and House Intelligence committees. Why did the U.S. continue to work with the 9/11 financial mastermind through the Afghanistan invasion until India disclosed his ties to Al Qaeda? Why has this direct financial link between the Pakistani ISI and Al Qaeda been virtually dropped like a proverbial hot potato by the 9/11 Commission and the mainstream media? Could it possibly be that both the ISI and Al Qaeda are “intelligence assets” of the CIA? 49 Recently, a Pentagon employee has come forward with details on how he was ordered to destroy documents identifying Mohamed Atta as a terrorist two years before the attacks on 9/11. Could this be part of a coverup to obscure Atta’s prior involvement as a CIA asset, code named Able Danger, 50 and that, in complete refutation of the government’s"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 137 official story, there was no intelligence failure regarding the CIA and Al Qaeda, or Al CIA’da? 51 17. Did the government or military purposefully withhold fighter protection or willfully create the massive confusion caused by the exercises and drills to allow the aircraft to strike the buildings and then lie to the American people and cover-up the real cause of the attacks and the collapses? 18. Why has the mainstream media and news outlets been in full dereliction of their duty as watch-dogs on the government by not investigating the attacks deeper beyond the whitewash of the 9/11 Commission and in full mouthpiece mode for the government? Why has the media not held the administration accountable to not pursuing Osama bin Laden, the alleged mastermind of the government’s version of the attacks? That is a good start at the questions to be posed to the government. The answers are already clear and dreadfully and horrifically obvious. You’ve been conned by the government, and as an accessory after the fact, the media. You now know in your heart, in your bones, and in your soul the evil and heinous truth. Criminal elements, entrenched within and occupying key positions of influence and power in the U.S. government and military, orchestrated the entire event for reasons of creating a pretext to deceive and shock the public into a state of fear. This mafia manipulated the visceral emotions of the trauma of 9/11 for malevolent political and economic gain, and also to railroad and buffalo the public through the false promise of security and protection into accepting the multitude of events and laws that have transpired since 9/11, such as the draconian Patriot Act, Homeland Security, Real ID Act, the Afghan and Iraq wars. There is also another possible reason for 9/11, an even uglier and treasonous possibility, a possible coup d’état and the decapitation of the Congress to lead directly to an imposition of martial law. You have to assume the very worst from this attack from within, for the stakes of failure and of being discovered were too big. If these elements were going to go as far as this attack was planned for, then you have to assume that they were going for full seizure of the government. Don’t believe it? Then"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 138 why did The Washington Post write about it on March 2, 2002 that Congress wasn’t aware of the Shadow Government in the face of the 9/11 attacks: Key congressional leaders said yesterday the White House did not tell them that President Bush has moved a cadre of senior civilian managers to secret underground sites outside Washington to ensure that the federal government could survive a devastating terrorist attack on the nation's capital. Senate Majority Leader Thomas A. Daschle (D-S.D.) said he had not been informed about the role, location or even the existence of the shadow government that the administration began to deploy the morning of the Sept. 11 hijackings. An aide to House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) said he similarly was unaware of the administration's move. 52 If you accept the later, and more plausible explanation, then the ENTIRE government official theory of 9/11 turns on its head and collapses upon itself, and you have to point the inquiry inwards to U.S. complicity. The government also helped to cover it up with its delaying of the 9/11 Commission, under-funding the Commission, stacking the Commission members with substantive conflicts of interest and also obstructionist members, with the destruction of evidence from the crime scene(s), the suppression of SEC investigations into insider trading on 9/11 affected companies. It’s an all or nothing proposition. Do you now see why WTC-7 is the keystone to the argument? Do you see now why the 9/11 Commission didn’t even make mention of it in its 2004 report? If you have any doubts whatsoever about the real cause of the collapse of WTC-7, then it immediately casts doubt and suspicion upon the government explanation of the causes of the rest of the events of 9/11. Failure to comprehend the importance of this argument can only be attributed as psychological denial, or as Orwell characterized, “protective stupidity.” Critical Decision Time . For a moment, imagine that you are seated on a U.S. Federal Grand Jury panel. The mountain of evidence is overwhelming, persuasive, and very compelling. You are presented with three choices, one being the ‘official theory’ promulgated by the government that the building fell due to a combination of fire damage and"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 139 structural damage from WTC-1 and WTC-2 collapses. The first scenario is dismissed due to the characteristics of minimal fires observed, minimal collateral impact damage compared to other, closer, affected buildings, extremely credible direct witness statements of explosives detonating, and the blundering confession of the primary leaseholder of ordering the “pulling” of the building. Another second scenario is presented by Larry Silverstein’s PBS documentary admission about “pulling” the building. The theory is that the F.D.N.Y. has a crack team of elite building demolition experts that can wire an unfamiliar building, currently on fire and smoke filled, in the midst of a national emergency and military crisis, in the midst of hundreds of thousands of tons of debris from WTC-1 and WTC-2 scattered around, in a moments notice. The theory also presumes that this team would also giving up pursuing search and rescue operations, including searching for their own brother firefighters, and then, surrounded with all the chaos of the debris, inaccessible streets, fleeing New Yorkers, broken bodies and parts strewn around, unrecognizable remains from panic stricken building jumpers, power outages, and ruined firefighting support gear, and physically affected by exhaustion, shock, and also by thick clouds of choking smoke, soot, and hazardous dust, they would carefully and quickly implode the building to the highest degree of precision to fit perfectly into its own footprint...all within a few minutes or hours notice, and all at the request of some civilian building landlord. Both of these scenarios are outrageously ludicrous and fully disingenuous. Under normal conditions, demolishing a building with explosives is a very hazardous, technical, and highly precise process which takes veteran industry professionals, at a minimum, several weeks, and up to a few months to plan, seek government approval, wire and position charges, and then execute the demolition for a large steel framed building – in an already gutted and prepared building.

Come on, wake up! If you don’t accept that hypothesis, then you must accept that the building was pre-planned to be destroyed and wired with high-explosives PRIOR to the 9/11 attack.

There are so many numerous and serious objections to the 9/11 Commission Report that I will not cover them in this paper, but if you are interested in a very thorough and scathing critique, I highly recommend the new book by Dr. David Ray Griffin, The 9/11 Commission Report: Omissions and Distortions . In 2005, Dr. Griffin has written a follow-up analysis that provides 115 critical and harsh objections to the report. 1 Budgetary Comparisons to Other Commissions . One key indicator of how serious the 9/11 Commission was in performing its duties, and in “leaving no stone unturned” in its investigation is by a cost comparison of the 9/11 Kean Commission to other large-scale disaster investigations and scandal inquiries and the amount budgeted for the pursuit of the truth in those inquiries. For example, consider these cost figures for other Congressional high-level investigations and the major event(s) that precipitated them: 1. 1963 JFK Assassination - Warren Commission: budgeted with $5.5 million (1963 dollars adjusted for inflation: $32 million). 2. 1986 Challenger Shuttle Disaster – Rogers Commission final cost: $50 - $60 million – the Rogers Commission was organized the next day after disaster. 3. Iran-Contra – Tower Commissi on: final cost $47.4 million. 4. Oklahoma City Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building Investigation: $60 - $89 million. 2 Lies, Omissions, Distortions"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 143 5. 1996 TWA Flight 800 NTSB and FBI final cost of investigation and reports: $31.4 - $40 million. 6. Ken Star & Clinton Whitewater and Lewinsky Perjury/Impeachment Investigations: $60- $70 million. 3 7. 2003 Columbia Space Shuttle Disaster: final cost $20 to $30 million. 8. 9/11 World Trade Center & Pentagon Attacks: Originally given a budget of only $3 million and began almost 413 days after the attacks, after considerable Bush Administration foot- dragging efforts to attempt to block and delay the authorization. The final estimated cost of the commission and investigation research – a paltry $12 to $15 million. When a space shuttle blows up, the government dredges the ocean floor or they scour the entire state of Texas and they reassemble the vehicle to determine the cause. When TWA-800 exploded and went down, the ocean was again dredged and the aircraft painstakingly reassembled by the NTSB in a warehouse to determine the mysterious cause of its breakup. With the events of 9/11, the buildings criminal evidence of the steel framing was hurriedly shipped overseas for melting down. It wasn’t even properly analyzed for insurance and future design and building construction purposes. The 9/11 Commission was initially budgeted $3 million for an investigation of the worst alleged foreign attack upon the U.S.? Does an initial $3 million starvation bare-bones budget sound sufficient to conduct an investigation worthy of an event of the historical precedent, scope, and magnitude of the 9/11 attacks? No, it does not. It operated on a shoestring budget, operated on the cheap. 4 They had to beg, plead, and finally be publicly shamed by the 9/11 survivors families to allocate additional funding extensions. For another outrageous and ridiculous comparisons to the 9/11 Commission budget, in 1996, a Congressional Commission to study the effects of gambling was given funding of $5 million, 5 in 1994 Congress allocated $20 million to study the feasibility and desirability of relocating salmon in the Columbia and Snake Rivers in Washington State. 6 Migratory fish got more funding than 9/11. Make the leap, connect the dots. It’s a coverup."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 144 The 9/11 Commission is Discredited The legal maxim, fraud vitiates everything, is applicable to the 9/11 Commission Report. In addition to being woefully underfunded, the 9/11 Commission has been roundly criticized and discredited on a number of fronts, and despite its claims to be thorough, it was anything but. Just a brief listing of the concerns exposes serious issues with the report. They include, but by no means are limited to the following: The 9/11 Commission investigation was vigorously stonewalled by the Bush Administration and highly resisted, it was delayed from being empanelled over 400 days. 7 The time delay was crucial to investigators and forensic specialists. Arson, bombing, or murder scenes are not routinely investigated over a year after the crime has occurred. The Administration withheld crucial documents from the Commission investigators 8 and the Commission allowed both President Bush and Vice-President Cheney to appear jointly in closed session and not under oath, with attorneys present. 9 Evidence and alternative theories ignored, and hearings were often conducted in secret session. It refused to allow the firefighters to testify in open session, 10 9/11 Commissioner member Max Cleland resigned from the position in disgust claiming \"Bush is scamming America...As each day goes by, we learn that this government knew a whole lot more about these terrorists before September 11 than it has ever admitted.” 11 The Commission failed to correct the FBI report of 19 Arab hijackers involved on 9/11 which it was later discovered that of the 19 listed by the FBI, 5-7 of them are still alive and breathing. Hijackers do not survive a 400+ mph crash into steel buildings, erupting into massive fireballs, causing a raging steel weakening conglomeration that would lead two massive building collapses, and walk away from them unscathed, over the Atlantic Ocean and on another continent. It just doesn’t happen, but if you believe the government explanation, you have to, because the government’s story depends on it. That’s a fundamental mistake or the very least an oversight. The Commission factually mischaracterized the central core structure of the WTC buildings as “hollow” when they were actually composed of massive 47 steel columns. The Commission also erroneously"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 145 reported that “no foreign government was involved,” yet completely disregards the critical evidence of the role of the Pakistani intelligence agency, the ISI, in wiring Mohammed Atta $100,000 just prior to the attacks and the moneyman met with key U.S. officials the week of 9/11. Key evidence from the crime scenes was destroyed, including the massive tonnage of steel framework of the WTC buildings that was hurriedly shipped under armed guard and with GPS tracking 12 to China and Korea for melting down without the benefit of a proper and professional forensic examination. 13 Such removals from crime scenes of critically important material evidence are usually very serious crimes, but after 9/11, expediency was the sole reason given for the cleanup, not the preservation of evidence for criminal or future engineering analysis. FEMA and NIST investigators did not have access to the World Trade Center blueprints, access to the Ground Zero crime scenes, and had very poor funding to carry out their technical investigations which would be absolutely fundamental in an honest and thorough engineering analysis. 14 It would also be critically important in any computer models and simulations. The 9/11 Widows advocacy group even lambasted the report, calling it a failure, and had as presenters several from the 9/11 Truth movement several of them cited in this book including, ex-CIA agent Ray McGovern, Morgan Reynolds, and Dr. David Ray Griffin, who outlined 115 critical errors, omissions, and misrepresentations in the 9/11 Report. 15 James Quintiere, a Fire Engineering Professor at the Univ. of Maryland also severely criticized the scientific investigation into the collapses and claimed that the National Transportation Safety Board, the usual agency that handles airline crashes, and the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Dept., should have been the primary investigating agencies due to their impartiality, broad access to resources, and thoroughness, and not politically assigned to an ad hoc group of part-time and volunteer engineers from FEMA with no access to the site, and control over the evidence. 16 It’s the equivalent of putting the varsity team on the bench and fielding the freshman junior-varsity practice team for the most important game of the season. Quintiere writes: "},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 146 I expected the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to head the investigations. It's noted for its thoroughness, objectivity and know-how with respect to large-scale disasters. But it wa s relegated to flight issues dealing with the two hijacked aircraft and the aircraft debris. The buildings were not to be within the scope of their investigation. There is an ad hoc investigative group, which is sponsored by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the American Society of Civil Engineers. But it does not have the full resources that might be made available, nor does it control the site. I became increasingly concerned the more I learned about the investigative process, or lack of one. The site team s at the towers were focused on rescue, retrieval and cleanup, not investigation. The structural steel pieces, coded with chalk and stamped numbers to indicate their building location, were being sold as scrap metal. The evidence needed to identify the cause of the collapse and intensity of the fire was being lost. Had the NTSB or ATF been involved, the site would have been secured, evidence documented and protected. Remember how the pieces of TWA Flight 800 were brought up from the ocean bottom off Long Island and restored to preserve structural evidence essential to identifying the cause of the 1996 crash? 17 Bill Manning, in the prestigious magazine Fire Engineering, a 125-year journal of record for fire engineers and firefighters and recognized experts in fire analysis and arson investigation said the investigation was a “half-baked face.” Regarding the destruction of crime scene evidence he said: Such destruction of evidence shows the astounding ignorance of government officials to the value of a thorough, scientific investigation of the largest fire- induced collapse in world history...Fire Engineering has good reason to believe that the \"official investigation\" blessed by FEMA and run by the American Society of Civil Engineers is a half-baked farce that may already have been commandeered by political forces whose primary interests, to put it mildly, lie far afield of full disclosure. Except for the marginal benefit obtained from a three- day, visual walk-through of evidence sites conducted by ASCE investigation committee members-described by one close source as a \"tourist trip\"-no one's checking the evidence for anything. 18 "},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 147 The FAA and NORAD were so unwilling to assist the commission that subpoenas were required to be issued to get them to release documents. Initially, witnesses were not even sworn under oath to testify to avoid possibility of perjury. Senator Mark Dayton D-MN excoriated the 9/11 Commission, the FAA, and NORAD when he stated in the 9/11 Congressional Hearings in particularly harsh language that the Commission’s Report is especially troubling and that government officials egregiously covered-up and lied in their testimony: It is a profoundly disturbing report because it chronicles in excruciating detail the terrible attack against our homeland, the despicable murder of so many American citizens and the horrible destruction to countless other lives and liberties throughout this nation. And because of the utter failure to defend them [American citizens] by their federal government, by their leaders, and the institutions that were entrusted to do so and because of serious discrepancies between the facts that you've set forth and what was told to the American people, to members of Congress, and to your own Commission by those, some of those authorities. Yes, it was a surprise attack. It was unpr ecedented. Yes, it exposed serious flaws and as you noted our imagination, our policies, capabilities and our management designs but what I find much more shocki ng and alarming were the repeated and catastrophic failures of the leaders of the leaders in charge, and the other people responsible, to do their jobs. To follow established procedures. To follow direct orders from ci vilian and military commanders. And then they failed to tell us the truth later. Yet NORAD's public chronology of 9/18/01 and their Commission testimony 20 months later covered up those truths. They lied to the American people, they lied to Congress and they lied to your 9/11 Commission to create a false impression of competence, communication, coordination and protection of the American people. And we can set up all the oversight possible at great additional cost to the American taxpayers and it won't be worth an Enron pension if the people"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 148 responsible lie to us; if they take the records and doctor them into falsehoods, and if they get away with it. For almost three years now NORAD officials and FAA officials have been able to hide their critical failures that left this country defenseless during two of the worst hours in our history. 19 [My emphasis] Why weren’t these government officials charged with perjury? Physical evidence from the FAA of radio and electronic communications between the hijacked planes and ground control were subsequently destroyed, using extraordinary measures , by the managers. 20 Why weren’t these officials charged with obstruction of justice, with destruction of evidence? One of the managers involved in the destruction deliberately crushed the tape, cut it with scissors, and then scattered the bits and pieces on various trash canisters to later disposal. 21 Fraud vitiates everything. To this day, the Pentagon continues to obstruct follow-up investigations related to 9/11 and the terror cell operating in the U.S. regarding classified intelligence project Able Danger and its connections to Mohamed Atta. 22 Representative Curt Weldon R-PA forcefully proclaimed that the 9/11 Commission performed as if it was engaged in a coverup to shield the Bush Administration and the Defense Department. Those are typically carefully weighed words and are not bandied around casually by elected officials. He said: Mr. Speaker, there is something here. I am not a conspiracy theorist, but there is something desperately wrong, Mr. Speaker. There is something outrageous at work here. This is not a third-rate burglary of a political campaign headquarters. This involved what is right now the covering up of information that led to the deaths of 3,000 people, changed the course of history, led to the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan, and has disrupted our country, our economy and people's lives. 23 In another angry, exasperated interview, Rep. Weldon pushes harder and ups the verbal ante regarding the coverup from the DOD and the 9/11 Commission, stating has proven: "},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 149 “...to be a disappointment and a failure, espe cially as it pertains to Able Danger.” [Possible explanations for this failure, says Weldon, include] “gross incompetence either on the part of the Commissioners or the Commission staff, or both,” or more alarmingly, “a deliberate cover-up that would make the Watergate scandal pale in comparison, expose even more blunders prior to 9/11 and point to a wider coverup. In two months, my limited staff has done what 80 staffers at the Commission and $15 million failed to do. In fact, when the New York Times broke this story in early August of this year, the 9/11 Commission was put in the uncomfortable position of having each of its successively evolving responses rebutted by newly emerging fact s. Each time the Commission changed its story, it brought further discredit upon its work. The 9/11 Commission did not do its job, did not complete its assignment, either through gross incompetence or deliberate omission. If the evidence were to point towards some sort of cover- up, the American people would be outraged beyond description. 24 [My emphasis] Representative Weldon has also gone so far as to mention that it may require a “Commission to investigate the Commission.” 25 Not exactly a glowing recommendation regarding the credibility, thoroughness, and independence of the Commission. Fraud vitiates everything. Suspicion must necessarily always fall on those who attempt to silence their opponents by legally gagging them under some thinly veiled claim of “national security,” or by hiding their testimony from public scrutiny. The government by its actions or its numerous omissions acts like the guilty party. The 9/11 Commission spent just enough and investigated just enough to give the appearance of doing something, without actually conducting a proper investigation. It was nothing other than a total white wash. It was as if the syndicate mafia’s consigliere conducted the investigation of the mafia boss’s crimes. Finally, as if having one last chance to prevent anything embarrassing from being released inadvertently in the commission’s findings, the entire Report was vetted, screened beforehand, to the White House before being released to the public. Ray McGovern, a former CIA officer wrote of the stink of the Commission and its results: "},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 150 the whole name of the game is to exculpate anyone in the establishment...why is it that after all this evidence and months and months of testimony, the commission found itself unable even to say if the attacks could have been prevented? This commission is not representative of America or of the families of those who died in 9/11. It is an archetypically establishment body, consisting of people who, with the exception of a token white woman, look exactly like me. They are all lawyers or politicians or both – and all acceptable to Vice President Cheney, who didn’t want a commission in the first place. The result is facile, mischievous, and disingenuous. 26 Millions Waking Up from the Deception. Many other Americans are waking up to the government lies. The American public has little confidence in the results of the 9/11 Commission as well. A Zogby International poll released in August 2004 indicated that only 36% believed the Commission has fulfilled its duty and 66% called for a new investigation into the 9/11 tragedy: Less than two in five (36%) believe that the 9/11 Commission had \"answered all the important questions about what actually happened on September 11th,\" and two in three (66%) New Yorkers (and 56.2% overall) called for another full investigation of the \"still unanswered questions\" by Congress. 27 Even more ominous for the ‘Official Version,’ the same poll indicates that nearly 50% of New Yorkers polled believed the government had foreknowledge of the attacks and that it “consciously failed to act” to prevent the attacks. Half of New York City’s 8.1 million people, 4 million, believe there is a cover-up by the government. Zogby again says: On the eve of a Republican National Convention invoking 9/11 symbols, sound bytes and imagery, half (49.3%) of New York City residents and 41% of New York citizens overall say that some of our leaders \"knew in advance that attacks were planned on or around September 11, 2001, and that they consciously failed to act. 28 9/11 Ground Zero protesters"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 151 On November 11, 2004, CNN hosted an online poll during the Anderson Cooper Show and asked the question if there was a 9/11 cover-up by the government: Out of 10,641 respondents, nearly 90% polled concluded that there was a cover-up by the government. 29 In Nov. 23, 2005, the Wall Street Journal /Harris Polling determined that nearly 64% of the people polled believed that the administration misleads them on current issues to achieve its own ends. 30 That is pure Machiavellian reasoning, “the ends justify the means.” People are waking up to the lies of the Administration. If the government has lied about the reasons for invading Iraq, fabricated Niger yellow-cake evidence, lied about WMD’s, lied about the Iraq-Al Qaeda linkage, lied about using torture methods on Iraqi prisoners, lied about using chemical phosphorus weapons in the assault on Fallujah, lie, lie, lie. Its’ just one Big Lie after another. Why would any reasonable person give them any credibility when it comes to 9/11 when there are plainly SO many holes, so many inconsistencies in the government explanation, so many instances of verbal slip-ups, instances of blatant foot dragging, destruction of evidence, obstruction, and cover-up? Even in the classic fable of the Boy who Cried Wolf, the villagers only gave the false crier two opportunities when he lied. What else are they lying about? Connect the dots and make the critical leap of faith. If the U.S. government is not at a minimum complicit and at a maximum in full control the events of 9/11 in some manner, then what is the reason for orchestrating and maintaining a cover-up? Who would manage a cover-up in any other criminal endeavor? The perpe-TRAITORS would. Many prominent former government officials, with considerable stature and reputation, upon whom the dismissive label “conspiracy theorist” is not usually applied, and others with a close connection to government operations and the intelligence community, as well as scientists have come forward to give their interpretation and analysis of the fraud of the government’s 9/11 version of events including such notables as: former.

According to Collins Sociological Dictionary , a “Conspiracy” theory is only to be considered suspect or reprehensible if it meets two conditions. First, if it is delivered in an outlandish, irrational manner, and secondly, if it is delivered without decent or credible evidence. 2 I hope that in your judgment I have satisfied those conditions in the arguments and with the evidence presented and cited. Conspiracies are not just a topic or plot device for movies, they are real. The media has done an excellent job of creating the grand archetypal image of the “conspiracy theorist” as someone being some secluded, tin-foil hat wearing, and talking-to-themselves mental case. Images of the disaffected, eccentric and"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 155 persecuted loner portrayed by Mel Gibson in the movie Conspiracy Theory , the quirky band and social outcasts of paranormal investigators from the X-Files, the Lone Gunmen. All have served to create the predisposition of abnormal behavior in considering these so-called outlandish and “beyond-the-pale” theories. Besides using compartmentalization, other methods to achieve silence and secrecy are often effective, such as bribery, coercion, and abject threats of death have proven to be prime tools to secure secrecy and obedient compliance. They also receive valuable assistance in keeping their secrets and their identities out of the mainstream media. Isn’t it brazenly - up in your face - obvious by now? The truths as I have presented here are very ugly, but they must be faced lest we continue living in denial. The attacks of 9/11, in addition to being an operation of near perfect military precision, were the most massive and successful exercise in psyops (psychological operation), ever devised. They were a “shock and awe” of the grandest scale upon the American public, and the world, as a pretext for the biggest power grab for world domination and empire since the earliest grabs for world domination beginning from the biblical recordings of the construction of fabled Nimrod’s Tower of Babel, to Egyptian Pharaoh’s Dynasties and Babylonian rulers such as Nebuchadnezzar, the sweeping Mongol hordes of Genghis Khan, Alexander the Great, the Caesar’s of Imperial Rome, Napoleon Bonaparte, and the planned 1000-year Reich of Adolf Hitler. The attacks on 9/11 were so ambitious, audacious, and grandiose in scale that anyone attempting to rationally explain any inconsistencies in the fraudulent “official theory” would be mockingly labeled a “conspiracy theorist,” and warrant an instant dismissal from credible debate and thoughtful inquiry. That fraudulent argument is nothing other than a weak-minded attempt at smearing and discrediting the messenger for daring to upset the status quo. It casually and even callously disregards the mountain of contradictory evidence, scientific and anecdotal evidence, accidental verbal miscues, corroborating statements from credible witnesses, and the growing tide of concerned voices that acknowledge that something to the government’s explanation for its incompetence is grossly amiss. It stems from either an intellectual laziness or an inability to rationally"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 156 discuss elements in contention of the established ‘official’ conspiracy theory of 9/11. The government readily admits that in some form, a conspiracy existed. They just want you to accept their version on blind faith and using the logical fallacy of appealing to power and authority. It also stems from a life-long diet of carefully controlled and disseminated information from mainstream media and propaganda professionals. You have been pre- conditioned to accept that anyone offering an alternative view bypassing the mainstream media gatekeepers on both the left and the right spectrum are out-of-bounds, to be scoffed at. It is an intellectual surrendering of discernment in favor of a predigested gruel offered by the talking heads of television and traditional print media. Like how a mother bird feeds her helpless and dependant chick, most people view it as easier to sit back, turn on the TV listen, and absorb the thirty second sound-bites and regurgitated mental dosing of the corporate-oligopoly media’s approved news than to independently gather, investigate, question, and decide for one’s self the day’s critical information and news. Your news and information is filtered according to the wishes of corporations and the government for a reason, it is the primary propaganda arm of the government and elites with their hands on the control levers. They don’t want you to think for yourself, to discover what they keep hidden from you. Profit and advertising ratings drives the modern media, not truth, and any news that could impede profit from their corporate handlers is automatically squelched, or given back-page treatment, where few will notice, and the press can honestly claim they covered it. The most dangerous man to any government is the man who is able to think things out for himself, without regard to the prevailing superstitions and taboos. Almost inevitably he comes to the conclusion that the government he lives under is dishonest, insane, and intolerable. ~ H.L. Mencken "},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 157 Again, the truth distills down from the legal principle of cui bono . Conspiracies both great and small have littered history with political intrigue and assassinations from Caesar, Lincoln, and Kennedy; countless wars, deceit, financial manipulations of markets, the Jack the Ripper murders, scandals of price fixing, the Final Solution of the Jewish Question, and its millions of deaths in the camps of Poland and Germany. History is a patchwork quilt of interwoven and interconnected conspiracies. If men wi ll conspire to steal political office, seize the reins of corporations, their neighbors wife, then why is it so unbelievable to consider that a group of men would conspire to control nations, or even the world, as others have attempted? It is the basis of the Big Lie Theory that Hitler described. Create a situation and tell an explanation to the masses for it that is so outrageous that even if the truth is ever revealed, even when backed up with mountains of evidence to disprove and counter it, the mass of people will still believe the lie. They cannot, or will not, believe that someone, even a perceived benevolent and supposedly democratic government, would ever tell such a monstrous lie, or allow it to go unpunished, if there wasn’t some basis of truth behind it. That is the pernicious trap of propaganda, especially when coming from the illusion of a free press. Most of the corporate-owned and profit driven monopoly mainstream media, have parent companies that are deeply entrenched within the defense establishment, for example, NBC is owned by General Electric, which itself is a major supplier to the military of advanced hardware, and as a consequence, hard investigative reporting that would lead to embarrassing or exposing parent companies is stopped by editorial decisions. People will engage in ridiculous and strenuous mental gymnastics to keep their preconceived versions of reality from collapsing around them. They have their entire lives invested in maintaining the illusion that has been provided for them, and they will dig their nails into the floor scratching and biting to prevent their world-view from collapsing around them. It was very hard for me to come to and accept these conclusions personally, but after much research, reading diverse mainstream as well as alternative news sources, and by viewing many independent"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 158 documentaries, it was the only rational explanation for those horrible events. There are also the focused campaigns of vilification against those that attempt to raise any alarm. They are slanderously labeled as “alarmists, fear-mongerers, right-wing extremists, paranoid-delusional, conspiracy theorists, tin-foil hat wearers,” and many other derogatory adjectives. These labels unfortunately are often successful in diverting valid attention away, and to beat down the messenger with a relentless cacophony of ad hominem, bypassing the actual argument presented. The theory that the Twin Towers were destroyed through controlled demolition and also that highest of administration officials actively planned and participated in the attacks are often too painful to face honestly and to contemplate; most people initially will reject the argument, even in the face of mountains of evidence. I personally hope this document will encourage you to reach out on your own for the truth regarding these events, to look outside the box. Psychological denial that borders on pathological, cognitive dissonance, and suppression are common defensive reactions when presented with information of the character and substance such as I have presented here. The implications of the data and analysis I have discussed here have very serious consequences that threaten to shake the foundations of the country, and even topple the government. It quite literally changes black to white, up to down. It fundamentally alters the presupposed safe relationship of the individual to the government and questions underlying assumptions of security for ourselves or for our families; it alters the social contract. Do not be afraid to be angry. The status quo cannot, and should not be allowed to continue as it is. The massive scale of corruption and the nauseating stench of evil and impropriety coming from Washington, the cover-up of the real reasons for 9/11 are cause for severe and drastic action. Justice will not be served until those truly responsible are brought before the scales and weighed. "},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 159 Massive Conspiracies Can Exist in an Open Society . Another reaction commonly heard against conspiracy theories in general is the question “How can a conspiracy so massive remain kept hidden and secret from the general population? The reason that operations such as this can remain hidden in plain view is compartmentalization. The majority of members or participants of the conspiracy generally do not have knowledge of the entire operation; they don’t see the full picture. There may technically thousands of people involved, but they do not have a “need-to-know” beyond the limited scale of their particular facet of the program. Only a few people in the highest levels have the knowledge of all the components of the project in full and clear view. They are profoundly arrogant, and like a thief likes to boast and brag about his crimes, the criminal elite also boasts to those that know where to look, they also like to blatantly throw it in our faces, the equivalent of saying “look at what we’re doing to you, but your too ignorant to realize that we’re doing it.” They are laughing at us, playing us for fools, and in many respects, they are right. We have been fools. Communication between members is actually often in the open, but buried in specialized journals, whitepapers, think tank policy papers, or publications in media the normal citizen would normally have no interest in reading. Other messages and clues are placed right out in the open, but without a key to decipher them, the average person cannot recognize it. When was the last time that any casual reader perused through an edition of Foreign Affairs , the quarterly publication of the Council on Foreign Relations? Another valid reason why conspiracies can thrive in an open society is that most people are too overloaded and concerned about the basic issues in their lives, their family or their job. They simply don’t, or can’t, slow down enough to examine all the events that affect them. The devils greatest trick was in convincing people he didn’t exist. Do you remember from your history classes the Manhattan Project? The top- secret atomic bomb development program during World War II was a project that employed over 130,000 people and had three top-secret cities created for it."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 160 The project remained top-secret from its founding in 1941, throughout the Trinity atomic bomb test in July 1945, and then was finally, but only partially, revealed to the public after the bombings of Japan at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. In 1942, at the University of Chicago, a primitive nuclear pile was started and achieved critical mass on December 2, 1942. It was kept secret in the middle of a major American city, in the heart of the campus of a busy college. The surveillance aircraft SR-71 Blackbird, the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber, and the stealth F-117 Nighthawk and other Lockheed “Skunk Works” top-secret research and development projects were officially denied for years. I have also demonstrated previously numerous examples of other projects like MKULTRA and Operation Gladio/P2OG of covert operations and medical experimentation far beyond the realm of public knowledge and discourse. Other examples of secret operations are Rex-84, CIA & FBI COINTELPRO operations, the recently disclosed nuclear survival bunker 40’ under the luxurious Greenbriar Hotel to house government officials in West Virginia for continuity of government, 3 Operation Garden Plot, Operation Cable-Splicer, Project Phoenix in the Vietnam War, the existence of the National Reconnaissance Office and the National Security Agency remained secret for many years and their on and off book budgets and operations remain so today, Eisenhower’s Operation Keelhaul , the Morgenthau Plan, weather modification and Project Stormfury , 4 Project Jennifer , Operation Paperclip and the “ratline,” the CIA’s usurpation of democratic government in 1953 Iran with U.S. sponsored coup of Mossadegh named Operation Ajax , the CIA sponsored coup of another democratically elected president Arbenz Guzmán in Guatemala called Operation PBSUCCESS , and the underlying true nature of HAARP, demonstrate conclusively that massively scaled secrets and projects can be kept among large groups of people. The existence of the famed Area-51 or Groom Lake was officially denied for many years until the weight of the proof of its existence required a superficial government explanation. What actually happens there is still the realm of wide ranging speculation, but the location actually exists, and under the highest levels of national security and secrecy. The same can be said for"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 161 the secret annual “Cremation of Dull Care” mock human sacrifice worship fire rituals performed underneath a large 40’ stone owl idol said to be representative of the biblically referenced demon named Molech. 5 (watch the free video online) These bizarre rituals are of a combination of Druidic and Canaanite fertility and death cults and conducted at the Bohemian Grove retreat for the initiation (either witting or unwitting) of political and business elites, including many attendees of self-proclaimed so-called Christian Conservatives, and also many of the highest officials in the Republican Party, in Northern California 6 or the moving meetings of the Bilderberg Group in Europe, and the secret society known as Skull & Bones 7 . It literally is something out of the twisted reality and perverse, bizarro world of Stanley Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut . Mainstream Media and Journalism is the Handmaiden to the System . Responsible journalism has always been considered the Fourth Estate of the government. It has traditionally been given the fiduciary responsibility of providing a check on the Executive branch of government and rooting out corruption in politics. It serves as the witness and the conscience of the people in between elections and is supposed to ask the hard questions, delve deeper into matters, and not take government pronouncements purely at face value. It is becoming more apparent the mainstream media (MSM) has abdicated its responsibility as a watch-dog to warn against government malfeasance. It routinely lobs deferential softball questions, if it even asks at all. How anyone can call the corporate monopoly media a “free press” is simply quite astounding. There is no such thing, at this stage of the world’s history in America, as an independent press. You know it and I know it. There is not one of you who dare write your honest opinions, and if you did, you know beforehand that it would never appear in print. I am paid weekly for keeping my honest opinions out of the paper I am connected with. Other of you are paid similar salaries for similar The Bohemian Grove Cremation of Care Ceremony – 40’ Stone Owl Idol"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 162 things, and any of you who would be foolish as to write honest opinions would be out on the streets looking for another job. If I allowed my honest opinions to appear in one issue of my papers, before twenty-four hours my occupation would be gone. The business of the journalist is to destroy the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the feet of mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread. You know it and I know it, and what folly is this toasting an independent press? We are the jumping jacks, they pull the strings and we dance. Our talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the property of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes. ~ John Swinton, New York 1890. Perhaps that lack of freedom and the unfettered, unbiased shilling of government propaganda and disinformation is the real reason for the decline of the MSM and traditionally vetted journalism. The monolithic dinosaurs of the MSM are also rapidly losing readership, and with that advertising, cutting back on staffing, exposed for fraudulent circulation reporting to investors/advertisers, and seeing the biggest threat to their existence with the growth of alternative media outlets, and specifically from the growth of the Internet and intrepid bloggers. The internet is supplanting the MSM off its traditional perch as the primary source of information, and is increasingly becoming seen as more reliable, as real and dedicated journalists, who have been marginalized by the profit-driven gatekeeper media in their decaying ivory-towers, find other avenues and audiences on the internet, unfettered by outside editorial controls and handcuffs. The mainstream broadcast media is becoming so ridiculously irrelevant to a growing number of people because it cannot even cover an innocuous holiday parade without covering up an unscripted accident by seamlessly merging stock footage into the broadcast and portraying it as the current event. 8 It is all about creating an illusion, and maintaining the government’s illusion. Anything that goes off script is to be avoided and altered before the public sees it. This is really very scary. How do we know what is real or not? Is it Wag the Dog ? "},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 163 If the corporate media is easily willing to betray the public trust and toss aside its fiduciary duty to the people and is able to instantly alter the reality of something as harmless and innocuous as holiday footage of a wayward parade balloon, and splice in the previous years’ footage, what other, significantly more important news item is already being, or has been, doctored to preserve some preset agenda or protect appearances? Is it news or is it propaganda? How can anything the media presents be trusted if this is how they conduct themselves, if they breach one of the foundational pillars of professional journalism – trust, on such a trivial issue, only to replace it with a scam artists’ imagination and the skill of a professional forger? This truly is a bizarro world gone mad. You cannot trust what the media places in front of you as authentic and truthful news – it’s fake, it’s staged, it’s filtered, it’s manipulated, it’s a shilled government propaganda piece. Fraud vitiates everything. Ron Suskind, a reporter for the New York Times , received a telling admission to a question from a senior advisor to President Bush about how reality is created and how it is perceived differently now. The advisor intimated: That's not the way the world really works anymore,'' he continued. ''We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you're studying that reality -- judiciously, as yo u will -- we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors . . . and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do. 9 Unfortunately for the MSM, famed Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein exposed another of the dirty secrets of the media when he dropped his bombshell in the October 1977 issue of Rolling Stone that the fourth estate of the government, the traditional watchdogs against Executive overreaching and excess for the People, has long been infiltrated by the CIA and that “America’s leading publishers allowed themselves and their news services to become handmaidens to the intelligence services.” 10 The MSM is increasingly becoming consolidated and controlled by fewer and fewer corporate interests, and has become the loyal lapdog, faithfully licking up whatever crumbs its master tosses it. David Guyatt writing on the infiltration of the media by intelligence services exposes a massive"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 164 cooperative relationship between the CIA and the most prestigious institutions of journalism and the most respected of newspapers: Sources told Bernstein that the New York Times , America’s most respected newspaper at the time, was one of the CIA’s closest media collaborators. Seeking to spread the blame, the New York Times published an article in December 1977, revealing that “more than eight hundred news and public information organizations and individuals,” had participated in the CIA’s covert subversion of the media. “One journalist is worth twenty agents,” a high-level source told Bernstein. Spies were traine d as journalists and then later infiltrated – often with the publisher’s consent - into the most prestigious media outlets in America, including the New York Times and Time Magazine . Likewise, numerous reputable journalists underwent training in various aspects of “spook- craft” by the CIA. This included techniques as varied as secret writing, surveillance and other spy crafts. 11 CIA-trained journalists, and presumably network news reporters/anchors crafting and packaging the message, in print and televised, is the hallmark of state sponsored propaganda. We used to criticize and joke about the KGB being involved with the Soviet-era newspapers Pravda and Isvestia , and now its here on the shores of the U.S . The corporate mergers and takeover of the media to the agenda of the government and its corporate owners controlling grip is becoming more pronounced. During the 1991 Bilderberg Group’s yearly conference at Baden Baden, Germany, David Rockefeller, former president of Chase Bank, said in an address said to the elite attendees with privileged members of the press represented as members amongst them: We are grateful to the Washington Post , the New York Times , Time magazine, and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years ... It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during these years . But, the world is now more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto-determination practiced in past centuries. 12 "},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 165 From the tone of multi-billionaire David Rockefeller’s comments, the media is in the pocket of the elite oligarchy, and has actively helped keep their activities in the dark and out of the public arena. Since 2000, the MSM has been timid and acquiescing to the state. It has not challenged the claims of the government, and has been profoundly derelict in its duties. Reporter Michael Petrelis used the Freedom of Information Act provisions to determine how energetic the MSM has been in doing investigations. He determined through examining FOIA requests from the media, the traditional media, that their FOIA requests have been dismally minimal. In fact, the numbers indicate that non-traditional media and investigators have been more diligent and active in pursuing the hard issues and requesting documentation, he writes: The Pentagon’s records reveal that the law is broadly used—more than 10,000 requests have been made since 2000. But they also illuminate a seeming dearth of curiosity by news organizations about the internal files of the U.S. military establishment. This lack of curiosity appears particularly evident among the nation’s three largest newspapers. In total, the three papers with daily circulations greater than one million-- USA Today , the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times -- made just 36 requests of the Pentagon between 2000 and February 2005. USA Today made nine; the Journal, six; and the Times, 21 [inquiries]. Leading print newspapers was the Los Angeles Times , with 42 inquiries. The Times recently ditched its national edition and announced last week it would lay off 85 newsroom staffers. Following the LA Times was the Washington Post , with 34—just shy of the total requests made by the three largest U.S. newspapers combined. The largest television networks made slightly fewer requests than the top print outlets. CBS News led the pack with 32 queries; Fox News followed with 22; and NBC News just was shy of that with 21. Fox—a frequent target of the left—filed more requests than the New York Times . CNN, the most-watched 24 hour news channel, made just 11 inquiries. 13 Robert Murdoch, media magnate, has come to acknowledge that the MSM is losing significant ground to the internet and that traditional newspapers are losing their relevance. He said pessimistically: “Outside New York, it's all monopoly newspapers...Some have good work in them, but it tends to be over- written, boring and elitist, not a reflection of the general mood of the public...And"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 166 I think you're going to find their circulations falling more than they have already have.\" 14 Investigative reporter John Pilger, twice awarded Great Britain’s highest award for journalism, the of “Journalist of the Year” writes that a insurrection against the MSM is underway in America, as millions are turning away from the traditional models of news and information gathering and are embracing the diversity and openness of opinion that is available on the Internet. He says: The insurrection is well under way. In trying to make sense of a dangerous world, millions of people are turning away from the traditional sources of news and information and to the World Wide Web, convinced that mainstream journalism is the voice of rampant power . 15 Mainstream journalism is the voice of rampant power, the voice of the state. It no longer speaks for the People. It has now become labeled as the U.S. equivalent to the Ministry for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda. Have you begun to realize what is ultimately at stake? The U.S. media is lazy and complacent; they are spoon-fed articles/stories from the government, or exposed as routinely paid to present government information, and are functionally nothing more than transcribers, stenographers and propaganda mouthpieces. For a nation that has enshrined in the Bill of Rights as the First Amendment, the freedom of the press, the U.S. ranks only 44 th among nations, as determined in a study by Reporters Without Borders. 16 Former communist nations have a higher ranking in freedom of the press than the U.S. does. The American press largely is a corporate tool to sell papers and advertising, it is not actively exposing government corruption. Thomas Jefferson spoke the truth when he stated over 200 years ago that: Advertisements contain the only truths to be relied on in a newspaper. I do not take a single newspaper, nor read one a month, and I feel myself infinitely the happier for it. The man who reads nothing at all is better educated than the man who reads nothing but newspapers. David Guyatt, quoting renowned MIT Professor of Linguistics Noam Chomsky, writes that the true role of the media, far from its stated and illusory democratic purpose, is in reality a tool of the elite interests to expand corporate power: "},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 167 The democratic postulate, Chomsky says, “is that the media are independent and committed to discovering and reporting the truth...” Despite this axiom, Chomsky finds that the media supports “established power” and is “responsive to the needs of government and major power groups.” He additionally argues that the media is a mechanism for pervasive “thought control” of elite interests and that ordinary citizens need to “undertake a course of intellectual self-defense to protect themselves from manipulation and control...” The covert role of the media has now apparently shifted its focus. One time expediter of the “cold war,” it now clamours for the extension of “corporate power. 17 Americans Have Been Repeatedly Lied To . The American public and the world, in front of the United Nations Security Council, have been repeatedly deceived and outright lied to concerning 9/11, Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq, fabricated Niger uranium yellowcake purchase evidence, the Oil for Food Scandals, the Downing Street Memo, 18 to incompetent or cleverly crafted and cherry-picked CIA reports. Joe Wilson, a U.S. diplomat writing in the Washington Post cryptically alludes to the pink elephant in the room: It really comes down to the administration misrepresenting the facts on an issue that was a fundamental justification for going to war. It begs the question, what else are they lying about? 19 What else are they lying about? The President has lied to the American people on numerous and on serious occasions. Each new lie is more brazenly outrageous and delivered bolder than the last. With all the lies that have been foisted on the public, why, why do we give the government a “free-pass” on the biggest reason for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, 9/11? In fact, in light of the accusations in this paper, all previous instances of terrorism are now suspect as to their actual sources and instigators. Fraud vitiates everything. Americans act like the proverbial battered wife, the government beats and exploits us, rapes our wallets and our treasuries, abuses our children by sending them off to an unjust and patently illegal war. The government cheats on We the People with corporate and foreign interests to the detriment of the People. Yet,"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 168 We the People are too scared to leave the relationship. It’s all that we know, we are dependant on it in so many ways, and the government says that it loves us, that it will take care of us, and protect us. And it also threatens that it will imprison us and possibly to even kill us if we attempt to leave it or change it, but leave it we must. If America can impeach a President for the gross impropriety of lying to an investigational body or prosecutor regarding a simple matter of a sexual indiscretion, then why can’t we impeach a President for lying to us, and to the world, to muster our support for a war based on a pack of lies? Do you really enjoy being scammed? Do you enjoy being taken for fools or playing the role of a sucker? What else is the government lying about? How about finally getting to the truth of the John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. assassinations, the USS Liberty attacks, 20 the TWA-800 shoot-down, the Waco Branch Davidian Compound Assault and Massacre, the 1993 WTC bombing, the 1995 Oklahoma City Murrah Federal Building bombing, and other so-called “conspiracy” theories? Were the recent London subway and transit attacks yet another precursor, a pretext, to the ratcheting up of methods to increase controls to diminish irretrievably our personal liberties and rights? 21 There have been countless phony wars waged by the U.S. government in the name of the American people, often upon the American people. These phony feel- good “Great Wars” include: Johnson’s war against poverty, Nixon and Reagan’s war against drugs, wars against illiteracy, Carter’s war on inflation and stagflation, Bush-41 and Clinton’s wars on crime, orchestrated campaigns against prayer and Christianity in schools and government influence, wars against environmental pollution, and Bush-43’s War on Terror.

Even with the basic law of averages, some of these wars should have been more successful that the actual result. In only those negative measurements were these phony wars a success, as they ultimately were intended. “If we were dealing with the law of averages, half the events affecting our Nation's well-meaning should be good for America. If we were dealing with mere incompetence, our leaders should occasionally make a mistake in our favor. We are not dealing with incompetence or stupidity, but with planning and brilliance\" As Franklin Roosevelt said: In politics, nothing happens by accident. If it happens, you can bet it was planned that way.” The Secret or Shadow Government . I make no apologies for the dramatic tone in these statements and for those yet to follow, but I believe that a secret, criminal, and deadly group exists within the government, a shadow government, and it wields considerable political and military power. It acts above the laws that it subjects, We the People, to. Throughout the course of American history, numerous respected and highly placed statesmen with access to privileged information and communications have spoken on the reality of this claim. As early as in the formative years of the American Republic, President George Washington, the Father of the Country, in 1789 indicated his acknowledgement of an insidious organization that conspires and seeks to separate the government from the People. 22 One hundred and twenty three years later, President Theodore Roosevelt when running as the Presidential candidate for the Progressive Party in 1912, gave an acknowledgement of this invisible shadow government when he stated: Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people. To destroy this invisible government, to dissolve the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day. The deliberate betrayal of its trust by the Republican party, the fatal incapacity of the Democratic party to deal with the new issues of the new time, have compelled the people to forge a new instrument of government through which to give effect to their will in laws and institutions. Unhampered by tradition, uncorrupted by"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 170 power, undismayed by the magnitude of the task, the new party offers itself as the instrument of the people to sweep away old abuses, to build a new and nobler commonwealth. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt also made direct reference to this behind- the-scenes influence in control of the government, a control that has nothing to do with the illusion of democracy when he wrote to Edward Mandell House: “The real truth of the matter is, as you and I know; that a financial element in the large centers has owned the government ever since the days of Andrew Jackson.” 23 This shadow government has not faded away over the years since Washington first took notice of it. Senator Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii) stated during the Iran- Contra Hearings: “[There] exists a shadowy Government with its own Air Force, its own Navy, its own fundraising mechanism, and the ability to pursue its own ideas of the national interest, free from all checks and balances, and free from the law itself.” Speaking before the U.S. Senate on February 17, 1950 James Paul Warburg, Roosevelt’s Secretary of the Budget issued this jarring warning: “We will have world government, whether or not we like it. The only question is, whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent.” Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter stated in 1952: \"The real rulers in Washington are invisible, and exercise power from behind the scenes.\" Another vital clue to what is transpiring on the world stage comes from a statement made in 1953 by H. Rowan Gaither, President of the Ford Foundation: \"[W]e at the executive level...operated under directives issued by the White House. We are continuing to be guided by just such directives, the substance of which were to the effect that we should make every effort to so alter life in the United States as to make possible a comfortable merger with the Soviet Union.\" Scholar and renowned professor of history at the Foreign Service School at Georgetown University, Carroll Quigley, goes to lengths to describe his experiences and insiders knowledge of shadow government operating in secret behind the façade of the public image of government in his book Tragedy and Hope . Quigley quotes Senator William Jenner (R-Indiana) during the start of the"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 171 Korean War in his book: “This country today is in the hands of a secret inner coterie which is directed by agents of the Soviet Union. We must cut this whole cancerous conspiracy out at once. Our only choice is to impeach the president and find out who is the secret invisible government which has so cleverly led our country down the road to destruction.\" 24 Quigley does not go so far as to claim Soviet agents, but he himself relates his intimate knowledge of those pulling the strings: There does exist and has existed for a generation, an international Anglophile network which operates to some extent in the way the Radical Right believes the Communists act. In fact, this network, which we may identify as the Round Table Groups, has no aversion to cooperating with the Communists, or any other groups, and frequently does so. I know of the operations of this network because I have studied it for twenty years and was permitted for two years, in the early 1960s, to examine its papers and secret records. I have no aversion to it or to most of its aims and have, for much of my life, been close to it and to many of its instruments. I have objected, both in the past and recently, to a few of its policies but in general my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown, and I believe its role in history is significant enough to be known. 25 Quigley also describes in extensive detail and background, the organizations that are prominent players in the chess games of world politics: International Bankers, The Council on Foreign Relations, The Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberg Group, and the secret societies of Skull and Bones (The Order) and The Round Table, among other lesser players. Renowned visionary scientist, inventor, author, and architect Buckminster Fuller was aware of the smoke and mirrors of the modern state-system when he said: “Great nations are simply the operating fronts of behind-the-scenes, vastly ambitious individuals who had become so effectively powerful because of their ability to remain invisible while operating behind the national scenery.” Quigley made the astute observation that \"more changes can be made in five years of war than in fifty years of peace.\" 26 Quigley also describes the final goal, an objective which given today’s technological advances and the present political stage looks all too achievable. He writes that the ultimate aim is to establish a system in which the individual's:"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 172 Freedom and choice will be controlled within very narrow alternatives by the fact that he will be numbered from birth and followed, as a number, through his educational training, his required military or other public service, his tax contributions, his health and medical requirements, and his final retirement and death benefits.\" This would be \"nothing less than a world system of financial control in private hands ... able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system [will] be controlled in a feudalistic fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert. 27 The philosophy of the Rockefeller-created Trilateral Commission is revealed by Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Carter’s National Security Advisor, in Between Two Ages . Writing in 1970, Brzezinski states that the Establishment's plans for America's future are \"directly linked to the impact of technology\" and \"involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled and directed society. Such a society would be dominated by an elite...unrestrained by the restraints of traditional...values [American peasants there goes your Constitution and Bill of Rights!] This exploitive elite would not hesitate to achieve its political ends by using the latest modern techniques for influencing public and keeping society under close surveillance and control. In the January, 1968, edition of Encounter , Brzezinski elaborated on the modern electronic prison camp he envisions for the U.S. It will be \"possible to assert almost continuous surveillance over every citizen and to maintain up-to-date, complete files, containing even the most personal information about the health or personal behavior of the citizen in addition to more customary data. These files will be subject to instantaneous retrieval by the authority.\" Did you get that? Authority, singular! Former FBI Agent Dan Smoot wrote in The Invisible Government that: I am convinced that the objective of this invisible government is to convert America into a socialist state and then make it a unit in a one-world socialist system.” 28 People will often mock and derisively scorn others that believe in the “tin-foil hat” conspiracy theories, but when FBI agents, Presidents, Supreme Court Justices, highly respected academics and journalists confirm the existence of shadowy organizations, the lay person better take a concerned notice. In 1987, respected"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 173 journalist Bill Moyers produced a documentary for PBS called “The Secret Government – The Constitution in Crisis.” In this ground-breaking documentary, he outlined the formation of this hidden shadow government. His introductory comments precisely sum up the characteristics of it, as well as their real danger to the Republic and the Constitution. He said: The Secret Government is an interlocking network of official functionaries, spies, mercenaries, ex-generals, profiteers and superpatriots, who, for a variety of motives, operate outside the legitimate institutions of government. Presidents have turned to them when they can’t win the support of the Congress or the people, creating that unsupervised power so feared by the framers of our Constitution. Just imagine that William Casey’s dream came true. Suppose the enterprise grew into a super-secret, self-financing, self-perpetuating organization. Suppose they decided on their own to assassinate Gorbachev or the leader of white South Africa. Could a President control them and what if he became the enterprise’s public enemy Number One? Who would know?

All we need is the right major crisis and the nations will accept the New World Order.\" Statements such as those from our founding fathers, elected officials through the history of the nation, occupying the highest positions of government, as well as the comments of the richest members of society, multi-billionaires, could fill many more pages of text and deserve our respectful and vigilant consideration. These are not the sensationalist utterances of alarmists, or in the language of the smear campaigns of the present media monopoly and professional discreditors and “spin” controllers, the ranting and ravings of “conspiracy theorists.” In 1917, Communist Revolutionary leader Vladimir Lenin proclaimed: First, we will take Eastern Europe, then the masses of Asia; then we will encircle the United States which will be the last bastion of capitalism.

Can we take Lenin’s words at face value these many years later? Mikhail Gorbachev said in party conference \"In October 1917, we parted with the old world, rejecting it once and for all. We are moving toward a new world, the world of Communism. We shall never turn off that road! - Comrades, do not be concerned about all that you hear about glasnost and perestroika and democracy in the coming years.

Indeed, with the ability to pull off a staged event on the scale of 9/11, there doesn’t seem to be a limit to their monstrous villainy, and they have in their possession the deadliest weapons of the American arsenal, and willing treasonous servants to use them. They have a plan for tyranny and a definite sense of urgency exists and events seem to reaching be speedily and desperately to reach a crescendo for a culminating event. The Government and the Military Industrial (Oil) and Intelligence Complex has already conspired and executed in dramatic fashion, murderous and treasonous plans that resulted in the deaths I described above. What else do they have planned, in what scale, and what time-frame, to maintain their stranglehold on the political process and American society? It is very likely that various incarnations of this group have existed and operated since President Eisenhower warned the public in his farewell address to the nation of this pervasive and persistent threat to America from these combined corporate threats: This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence -- economic, political, even spiritual -- is felt in every city, every State house, every office of the Federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society. In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power ex ists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.

Johnson on forward to George W. Bush), has formulated plans to attempt to secure the remaining Middle East oil resources – likely with your son’s and daughter’s blood. Will you sit there and let them unopposed? Will you delay resisting until the boot holds you down by the neck? How long do you suppose China and Russia idly standby and allow the U.S. to run unopposed in the region and deprive them of oil resources without running into a military conflict? 30 Already the regional powers in Central Asia are their rattling sabers and training for what seems to be an inevitable conflict with the U.S. On such strategic issues as the control of oil resources, is it unreasonable to assume that this conflict will not be limited to non-nuclear warfighting? The U.S. is already formulating plans for pre-emptive nuclear attack on nations, or terrorist groups. 31 Rumors of reinstituting the draft are circulating again and several attempts at introducing legislation have already occurred in 2003 and again in 2005. 32 The military is even trying to push through a policy change to allow the mandatory recruitment (draft) age to be raised to 42 years old. 33 But this is all just another coincidence; there’s nothing to worry about. In the beginning of a change the patriot is a scarce man, and brave, and hated and scorned. When his cause succeeds, the timid join him, for then it costs nothing to be a patriot. ~ Mark Twain, 1904 The American ‘Sheeple’ are not Vigilant.

As a wild stallion is “sacked out” 34 before someone can safely ride it, the American people are being trained and desensitized to the police state slowly being unveiled so they we will accept it without creating a stir. For the most part, they selfishly are concerned only for themselves, “as long as they get theirs.” Are you going to let them conduct another attack and then declare martial law, suspend the Constitution, and institute a draft? Will you observe in meek compliance, complacent silence, and with moral indifference as your neighbors are hauled away secretly in the middle of the night? Who will stand up for you when the knock finally arrives at your door? The majority of people are in condition of willfully pretending everything is normal, that no situation exists. Despite the constant drum-beating and chest thumping, the American people are very fearful. They are too fearful to ask questions for appearing to be unpatriotic, too fearful to acknowledge the evidence that is right before their eyes, before their fingertips, and whispered by many and shouted by some. It takes less courage to fire long-range weapons than to face the real situation. It takes profoundly more courage to stand up against the treachery and lies of the state, than to march off to war for the state...which makes the protester MORE of a patriot than the soldier blindly following orders. Until that day arrives, just keep on being content with reading and memorizing the minutia of utterly unimportant statistics from the daily sports section, catatonically watching the mind-dulling electronic sludge and poison of “reality TV,” the World Series or the Super Bowl, mesmerized, hypnotized, tranquilized, marginalized, pacified, oblivious, distracted, asleep, and tuned out from the events that really affect you and your family. The addictive and non-stop bombardment of the drugs of escapism are provided by the willing brigades of the professional propagandist upon too many uninformed and uncaring Americans tranquilized by the sludge of mainstream media, the debased fantasy world projected onto silver screens will not prevent the potential economic collapses over the horizon.

The danger is growing just over the horizon. You might not be able to see it, but you can intuitively sense it. You can hear the horn of the onrushing train, and you can feel the vibrations trembling and building in the ground. You may not realize it, but a high-tech police state is being erected silently and without your consent all around you. The elite powers in control are pulling an end-run around the democratic process and quietly subverting the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. It’s already been documented that most elected representatives do not even read the full text of legislation before they pass them into laws. 35 Rep. Ron Paul R-TX said that the Patriot Act was not made available to legislators before they were vote on it in the middle of the night: \"It's my understanding the bill wasn't printed before the vote — at least I couldn't get it.” They played all kinds of games, kept the House in session all night, and it was a very complicated bill. Maybe a handful of staffers actually read it, but the bill definitely was not available to members before the vote.\" 36 Governments and politicians that sponsor this type of stealth legislation, acting as if they are trying to set a trap, usually are. Consider what other sneaky legislations have been slipped through the backdoor with political parlor tric ks, the Federal Income Tax, the Federal Reserve Banking System, and the United Nations Charter. Ask yourself why? Let’s scale the issue down and look at the methodology.

Of course not, but that is the type of shenanigans and deception that are common in Washington. If you won’t read the legislation, and if the elected representatives don’t read them, who knows what dangerous and despicable planks are secreted away in them by special interests and highly paid lobbyists? The government is routinely force feeding the sheep with internal propaganda veiled as mainstream news coverage of their policies, in direct contravention of long held bans on such media manipulation. 37 Do sheep realize their danger when the shearing is done and they are loaded onto a hauling truck heading to slaughterhouse destinations? Do the sheep realize it even when they are unloaded from the truck and led by a Judas goat to the killing floors? Do lemmings know where they are blindly headed just before going over the cliff? Are you polishing the brass or rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic? The gullible and unwashed masses of the silent majority of the nation, the booboisie, are too busy watching WWE wrestling, NASCAR, downloading porn, and drinking their Budweiser’s to notice that the wool is being pulled over their heads. They rabidly cheer their political party affiliation and frothingly parrot the partly line or whatever political slogan mantra is in vogue like they rally and cheer on their favorite NFL football team. The frog in the pot sees the bubbles forming on the bottom of the pot but it’s not concerned as they only just “tickle” right now. And the dial is turned a little higher.

Are you trembling to the core yet? Are the alarm bells ringing yet? Are you furious? As an American, as a moral human being, you most definitely should be. There is open discussion by our elected misleaders and world bankers, described accurately by Louis T. McFadden, former Chairman of the Banking and Currency Committee, as a “dark crew of financial pirates,” of the creation of a New World Order that seeks to supplant the current nation-state system, and by deduction, the dissolution of the United States into a world government. And the press is not covering it. Why? This government has already committed mass murder, numerous times over, and it falsely claims that the “terrorists” are already planning more attacks and on a larger scale to keep us in fear and compliant for their plans to maintain or widen the War on Terror. That possibly means plans are drawn for nuclear, biological, or chemical attacks – likely self inflicted attacks.

Go ahead, enter the following terms into a Google search string and be amazed at the results, or follow the footnotes to their links. I dare you. Don’t look the other way. Look your enemy in the eyes and face it. This is not unjustified fear mongering. These sinister mechanisms are actually being overtly implemented through deceit and by fait accompli without your knowledge and with subverting and flanking maneuvers, an end- run around the protections and provisions of the Constitution. Many of these items are secreted in legislation that is thick as a New York phonebook and unread by our elected representatives; others are “administratively” implemented by fiat. If full disclosure is not the forté of the executive branch, you can also fairly sure that obscuration also applies to the legislative as well. Our local police our being militarized with federal funding and training incentives, they garbed in the classic black uniforms, tools, and weapons of intimidation such as the uniforms of medieval executioners, the uniforms terrorists used in the 1972 Munich Olympics, and in Militarized Tactical Police-SWAT Stormtroopers - an y real difference?"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 182 the SWAT uniforms comparable to stormtroopers and Darth Vader. They are being deliberately conditioned to view us as “civilians” while they are the “officials,” creating an artificial superiority and a dangerous division. The conduct numerous compliance operations, merely to condition the public to follow their commands without question. An obedient and subservient population is being trained to follow directions with no questions asked, like the “good German’s” in the 1930’s to 1940’s. The growing list of legal and technocratic control and intimidation measures that can be fairly characterized as a blending of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World and George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty Four are straight out of a science fiction novel. Each separate piece of the puzzle, viewed singularly appears initially as an innocuous and benign mechanism of societal or technological advancement, but when they are assembled together, they weave a picture that reveals a complex and interdependent human control grid of malevolent design and application. Each individual strand on a spider’s web appears insignificant and does not give a hint to its potential danger, but yet when hundreds or thousands of individual strands are woven together it forms a deadly trap that is difficult to escape when the intended prey is ensnared. Couple the short-attention span of the majority of the population with the fear generated in the post 9/11 environment and you create a political climate that enabled the implementation and positioning of these control measures for current and future use. They include ever-widening anti-privacy laws, technological terrors, and other human control measures that are ever slowly unveiled and growing daily, for example: Decades-long continual so-called generational wars, 39 rigged electronic voting machines that can be hacked 40 and manipulated to circumvent the will of the people and leaving no paper trail – as Soviet dictator and mass murderer Joseph Stalin explained “It’s Law Enforcement PHaSR Anti- Crowd Star Wars Weapon"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 183 not who votes that counts, it’s who counts the votes,” 41 lapdog corporate media, photo-ops, and staged media events by politicians and government officials, 42 millions of security cameras erected everywhere, 43 fake and staged terror alerts to scare the population into submission and into further surrendering of their rights and conditioning Americans for greater abuses and usurpations for a phony idea of state provided protection, 44 the Orwellian-named Patriot Act that has ripped to shreds the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, National ID (H.R.418) and biometric systems, 45 the Patriot Act being used in non-terrorism cases 46 (such as against terrorists like homeless people, 47 drug violations, veterans and citizens with legitimate complaints, 48 art exhibits shut down, 49 patent enforcements, minor drug violations, Paypal and online gambling harassment, 50 striptease club corruption probes, 51 toy store harassment, 52 and many others), a massive and intrusive security apparatus that rivals the Soviet KGB: New Justice Department guidelines to be unveiled today will give FBI agents latitude to monitor Internet sites, libraries and religious institutions without first having to offer evidence of potential criminal activity, The FBI is now telling the American people, `You no longer have to do anything unlawful in order to get that knock on the door,' \" said Laura Murphy, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Washington office.

If that happens, Franks said, “... the Western world, the free world, loses what it cherishes most, and that is freedom and liberty we’ve seen for a couple of hundred years in this grand experiment that we call democracy.” Franks then offered “in a practical sense” what he thinks would happen in the aftermath of such an attack. “It means the potential of a weapon of mass destruction and a terrorist, massive, casualty-producing event somewhere in the Western world – it may be in the United States of America – that causes our population to question our own Constitution and to begin to militarize our country in order to avoid a repeat of another mass, casualty-producing event.

Paul Bigioni writes in an eye opening article “Fascism then, Fascism now”: “Most people associate fascism with concentration camps and rows of storm troopers, yet they know nothing of the political and economic processes that led to these horrible end results. Before the rise of fascism, Germany and Italy were, on paper, liberal democracies. Fascism did not swoop down on these nations as if from another planet. To the contrary, fascist dictatorship was the result of political and economic changes these nations underwent while they were still democratic.” 115 The substance of fascism is present even today, and is growing like a rampant cancer tumor.

By matching Eco's list of fascist commandments against our record of achievement, we can see how well we've begun the new project for the next millennium - the notion of absolute and eternal truth embraced by the evangelical Christians and embodied in the strict constructions of the Constitution; our national identity provided by anonymous Arabs; Darwin's theory of evolution rescinded by the fiat of \"intelligent design\"; a state of perpetual war and a government administering, in generous and daily doses, the drug of fear; two presidential elections stolen with little or no objection on the part of a complacent populace; the nation's congressional districts gerrymandered to defend the White House for the next fifty years against the intrusion of a liberal-minded president; the news media devoted to the arts of iconography, busily minting images of corporate executives like those of the emperor heroes on the coins of ancient Rome. The early twentieth-century fascisms didn't enter their golden age until the proletariat in the countries that gave them birth had been reduced to abject poverty. The music and the marching songs rose with the cry of eagles from the wreckage of the domestic economy. On the evidence of the wonderful work currently being done by the Bush Administration with respect to the trade deficit and the national debt -- to say nothing of expanding the markets for global terrorism -- I think we can look forward with confidence to character-building bankruptcies, picturesque bread riots, thrilling cavalcades of splendidly costumed motorcycle police. 116 Americans have dangerously forgotten the valuable lessons of history; have been left behind and uneducated to the real perils that are slowly creeping, being maneuvered into their staging positions.

Would any of those items listed on the preceding pages, if but not for the fear created and the paranoia continuously foisted upon us after the terror of 9/11 and subsequent staged reinforcing events, have been allowed to be passed? Liberties are not seized all at once, they are surrendered in degrees. Each compromise is in reality a surrender, ground given up. Laurence Britt, Ph.D., in his widely circulated article “Fascism Anyone,” compiled a list of fourteen characteristics and common threads of seven nations that were totalitarian or despotic, how they arose and maintained their power. 117 Through lens of unfiltered history, this list paints a chilling portrait of the degree of progress of the fascist direction America is marching blindly towards today. 118 If you had to answer the question of what a police state looked like, or were hypothetically going to design your own, wouldn’t many of the above items be on your list? Wouldn’t they? If Hannah Arendt were still alive today, she might have to revise here classic treatise The Origins of Totalitarianism and add a chapter for a case study of the current state of affairs in the budding of a fascist Amerika. May God help those of you with eyes, but cannot or will not see; those of you that have ears, but hear not. 119 Winston Churchill defined the quality of despotism when he wrote: The power of the Executive to cast a man into prison without formulating any charge known to the law, and particularly to deny him the judgment of his peers, is in the highest degree odious and is the foundation of all totalitarian government whether Nazi or Communist. ~ Winston Churchill, British Prime Minister.

He writes: Four sorrows, it seems to me, are certain to be visited on the United States. Their cumulative effect guarantees that the U.S. will cease to resemble the country outlined in the Constitution of 1787. First, there will be a state of perpetual war, leading to more terrorism against Americans wherever they may be and a spreading reliance on nuclear weapons among smaller nations as they try to ward off the imperial juggernaut. Second is a loss of democracy and Constitutional rights as the presidency eclipses Congress and is itself transformed from a co- equal \"executive branch\" of government into a military junta. Third is the replacement of truth by propaganda, disinformation, and the glorification of war, power, and the military legions. Lastly, there is bankruptcy, as the United States pours its economic resources into ever more grandiose military projects and shortchanges the education, health, and safety of its citizens. 124 Do you see any current levels in parallel currently in the U.S. with what he warns against? The government has already been described by high-ranking former members as being dominated by a “cabal” in the highest levels of the Bush Administration. 125 A “cabal” is usually defined as: “1. A conspiratorial group of plotters or intriguers;” or also as “2. A secret scheme or plot.” 126 It’s highly disconcerting when a former member of the Bush Administration is characterizing them as “conspiratorial schemers and plotters.” Lawrence Wilkerson, former Chief of Staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell characterized the decision-making process in the White House"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 195 as “...insular and secret workings were efficient and swift — not unlike the decision-making one would associate more with a dictatorship than a democracy.” 127 Let’s repeat that, “associate more with dictatorship than democracy.” Do I have your attention? In late December 2000, President-Elect George W. Bush casually related during the transition process that “If this were a dictatorship, it'd be a heck of a lot easier, just so long as I'm the dictator.” 128 He already claims to be above the law and beyond public questioning when he stated to reporter Bob Woodward: “I’m the commander. See, I don’t have to explain why I say things. That’s the interesting thing about being the president. Maybe somebody needs to explain to me why they say something, but I don’t feel like I owe anybody an explanation.” 129 Conservative Republican Paul Craig Roberts, member of the Reagan Administration claimed in a radio interview with Alex Jones that: I think the United States government is in the hands of psychopaths. I mean these are insane, dangerous people. They are a disgrace to the human race, they certainly are a disgrace to every American. These people somehow have to be rounded up and held accountable, every one of them as far as I am conc erned is a war criminal, they should be turned over to the court in the Hague. I don’t think we’ve seen an administration this evil in my lifetime, and that includes Stalin and Hitler. 130 Is it already too late? The courageous story of the passengers of Flight 93, the aircraft that was shot down over Pennsylvania on 9/11, speak to the heroism and self-sacrifice common to most Americans. They wrestled control away from the hijackers knowing that they could possibly die, or that the aircraft would be crashed into some undetermined target, yet they chose to risk, to be daring, and to not accept the fate that the hijackers had planned for them, they died on their own terms. They knew the risks, yet they took them anyways. They knew the consequences if they just sat back in their seats and quietly accepted the fate that was before them.

It is undeniable and uncontestable. You can choose such courage and heroism also. On the eve of the famous Battle at the little mission in San Antonio de B é xar, the Alamo, the commanding officer Colonel William Travis allegedly stood before his contingent of only about 250 men, including the 12-man Tennessee Mounted Volunteers, the New Orleans Greys, and also such individual legendary heroes as Sam Bowie and frontiersman Davy Crocket. They faced off against Mexican General Santa Ana and his army of approximately 1600 troops. Travis stood before his assembled men and drew a line in the sand with his cavalry sword and asked those in the formation if they would dare cross the line to stay and defend the Alamo against the most impossible odds of survival and likely face ultimate outcome of the impending siege. According to the legend, all but one man crossed the line, and the invalid Bowie asked to be carried across the line.

In a fundamental sense, no political or human rights have ever been secured by military forces, or by police forces. Contrary to popular opinion, they do not secure our liberties; they secure the interests of the state and often of the multi- national corporate business model. We the People are the ones who secure our rights and maintain our rights. Military forces secure territory and prevent external invasion or other forms of attacks. Police forces enforce state and local laws and secure the general order. Fundamental human rights and human dignity have only been secured throughout history by a informed, vigilant, and energetic citizenry, often unarmed and disadvantaged, standing against the state and its military power and demanding their rights and seizing them. The police and the military, unless they give support and loyalty to the movements of protest, or withhold it from the state, are the security apparatus of the status quo and they are used by the state, sometimes brutally, to suppress and repress the citizen’s demands for their rights. Without the ability of citizens to nonviolently protest and engage in the rich history and time-honored practice of civil disobedience in this country, many of the rights we Americans enjoy today would not have been possible. The state is not going to voluntarily give these rights, they had to be claimed and taken back, not without resisting often after conflict with the apparatus that the state can bring to bear against the claimant. It took a Revolutionary War to throw British rule of the continent. It took a Civil War to secure the freedom of the Slaves.

She, and many other Black leaders, including a young minister named Martin Luther King, Jr., helped to start the Montgomery Bus Boycott for 381 days until the segregation laws were lifted. Vivian Malone and James Hood marched through violent, hostile, and abusive crowds, including State Troopers of Alabama, at the University of Alabama to face off against Governor George Wallace at the front of the school-house door to fight against desegregation. Other non-violent examples of successful protest include: The Freedom Riders in May 1963, Lunch Counter Sit-ins at Greensboro, North Carolina, the Selma to Montgomery Marches and the Bloody Sunday protests. 131 In 1965, César Chávez led the United Farm Workers on lengthy and successful strikes against commercial growers for rights and fair wages for exploited migrant workers, including using hunger strikes. The 1967 Dow Chemical student sit-ins and strikes as the University of Wisconsin and the violent and brutal crackdown by police that put 65 students into the hospital. The 1970 Kent State student massacre by Ohio National Guard troops revealed the growin g frustrations of the American public at the government for the conduct of the Vietnam War and tragically led to inexperienced troops firing on the unarmed and protesting students. The killings helped to galvanize protest movements across U.S. college campuses and hastened the end of the war by stirring the national outrage created by the senseless slaughter of the students.

If you are a soldier, you took an oath of loyalty and allegiance to “support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and also to bear true faith and allegiance to the same.” The military oath requires primary allegiance to the Constitution, not to illegal orders given by either the President, or from your superiors, by virtue of its placement first in the oath. In fact, the command to follow the orders of the President comes third in the hierarchy of the oath, and allows for the exceptions provided for in the Uniform Code of Military Justice to not follow unlawful orders. In other words, you are required and duty-bound to disobey unlawful orders, from any commander. You alone will have to make that determination, not your superior officers. Do not surrender your right to make your own ethical determinations. You have already seen demonstrated how they will hang you out to dry for following their illegal orders while they that issue them unjustly go unpunished. If you follow orders to betray and trample on the Constitution or the Bill of Rights, you are being treasonous to your oath and to your country.

It may seem odd for me, a military man to adopt such a comparison. Truthfulness compels me to. I spent thirty-three years and four months in active military service as a member of this country's most agile military force, the Marine Corps. I served in all commissioned ranks from Second Lieutenant to Major-General. And during that period, I spent most of my time being a high class muscle-man for Big Business, for Wall Street and for the Bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. I suspected I was just part of a racket at the time. Now I am sure of it. Like all the members of the military profession, I never had a thought of my own until I left the service.

He writes in total condemnation of the folly and fraud of American political and military leaders, calling for their impeachment:"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 209 For misleading the American people, and launching the most foolish war since Emperor Augustus in 9 B.C sent his legions into Germany and lost them, Bush deserves to be impeached and, once he has been removed from office, put on trial along with the rest of the president's men. 162 In the debate of the Virginia ratification of the U.S. Constitution, the great Patriot and bold signer of the Declaration of Independence, Patrick Henry loudly gave the argument that if the Congress should ever pass laws to justify cruel and unusual punishment, including the application of torture methods common to France, Spain, and Germany, that the country was “lost and undone.” 163 The dream of America created by our Founding Fathers is indeed being undone from within. Those days are upon us now. The United States Army Military Academy at West Point has the cadet motto “Duty, Honor, Country.” Despite the honored tradition, I believe that the order is incorrect. It should be reversed to “Country, Honor, and Duty.” Too high is the risk that the idea of duty can be twisted and used to trample over the idea of Country. President Theodore Roosevelt, the heroic commander of the Rough Riders during the charge of San Juan Hill in the Spanish American War in Cuba, perhaps said it best about morally treasonable blind obedience to the government, and to the Presidency in particular: The President is merely the most important among a large number of public servants. He should be supported or opposed exactly to the degree which is warranted by his good conduct or bad conduct, his efficiency or inefficiency in rendering loyal, able, and disinterested service to the Nation as a whole. Therefore it is absolutely necessary that there should be full liberty to tell the truth about his acts, and this means that it is exactly necessary to blame him when he does wrong as to praise him when he does right. Any other attitude in an American citizen is both base and servile. To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public. Nothing but the truth should be"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 210 spoken about him or any one else. But it is even more important to tell the truth, pleasant or unpleasant, about him than about any one else. 164 The often heard justification of “I was under orders,” or “I am just doing my job,” did not succeed in the legal defenses of Nazi’s for War Crimes at Nuremberg in 1946, or in the 1970-71 courts martial trial and conviction of U.S. Army Lt. William Calley for war crimes resulting from the My Lai Massacre, or in the many courts martial resulting from the Abu Ghraib torture cases. Ask yourself one question: Do you think your superiors will, in this political environment, face charges for issuing the orders for YOU to torture people or trod over the Constitution? Remember this, Rumsfeld and Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez issued permission the wide latitude to torture subjects 165 under the code-word of Copper Green, 166 but it was only their lower level minions that were convicted and sentenced to prison, as in the case of Army Pfc. Lynndie England. Your superiors will give you the same immoral and unlawful orders and they will hang you out to dry when you’re conveniently and expeditiously discarded to face the punishment they rightfully deserve. There will likely be a day soon where you will be ordered to suppress your own citizens, where you will be called upon to fire upon your own American brethren. Refuse that order. If you are active duty or reserve you can file conscientious objector claims or you may make the hardest decision and refuse to serve, but be aware that you will be persecuted.

If or when the time comes, if you can still bend your index finger, you can defend the Constitution and the Nation. Becoming Informed and Getting Involved . You can become involved in your community in many ways. Standup and inform yourself, wake others up, but expect to face resistance and even biting ridicule. When the brave signatories to the Declaration of Independence affixed their names to the document, they pledged their very lives, their wealth, and their property to the cause of American freedom from the domination and the tyrannical rule of Britain and King George. They became enemies of the British Empire and would have faced execution, not only of themselves, but also their families if they were captured. Where are our courageous and honorable statesmen today? You let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up!

Become engaged in the opposition, for tyranny does not mercifully pass over those who lay down before it; rather, it destroys the weak and defenseless and then feeds on their carcass. They are vampires and will drain you until you are a dead and empty husk. In the fables of Aesop, the tiny mouse rescues the captured lion, the king of the beasts, by chewing away the rope and thus repays a life debt to lion for earlier sparing it. It is an allegory of how the smallest of creatures, the weakest, can fill a critical role in a desperate moment. The legend of the power of the mouse to install fear in a herd of mighty elephants and cause them to stampede, while not factually based, serves also of a reminder of the power of the seemingly inconsequential and the marginal to move even the largest of animals. The relevance to events in the world is obvious. We are the mice; we stand against a deeply rooted evil and a growing tyranny. We the People have the real power, and with the help of God, together we can make a difference. Remember the biblical parable of the mustard seed (Mt. 13: 31-32).

Others mentioned also include discussion of whether or not there were external fuel or missile pods on the aircraft that hit the World Trade Center buildings, many of these are very ludicrous and only serve to distract from the solid research that has been done. I do not subscribe to those theories. I cannot disprove a negative so I don’t hold my hat on that peg for the sake of the overall theory, but you should still be informed of them. I believe that there are stronger arguments to be made that pull the legs out of the official government conspiracy theory, such as WTC-7 and the as yet undisclosed stock trades immediately prior to 9/11. Prosecuting attorneys present evidence, their strongest arguments, in cases before the jury, and that was my intent with this presentation.

He said at that point he thought there were bombs up there because it was too even. As we’ve since learned, it was the jet fuel that was dropping down that caused all this. But he said it was too even. Q. Symmetrical? A. So his original thought was that he thought it was a bomb up there as well... We didn’t know the building came down. We just knew the top of the building exploded and didn’t know what happened to the rest of the building. You just couldn’t see anything.

I thought it was some kind of thermal explosion where I’m either going to get burnt -- and I had kind of ideas that it was going to be something like Hiroshima where all this heat was coming at me and we were going to get burnt or if the heat didn’t burn me, I thought that all the parts coming out of this building, the windows, metal, all the things like that, that I might be severed in half. It turned completely black. F.D.N.Y. Firefighter George DeSimone http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/nyregion/20050812_WTC_GRAPHIC/DeSimone_Geo rge.txt ___________________________________________________________________ After that it was kind of pandemonium.

People were saying don’t stand under there, it’s going to come down. And then by the time I made it back around, I went to the front on Church Street and came back around. The area we took that civilian out of had all collapsed. That wasn’t there anymore. So at that point we were a little leery about how the bridge was tied in, so no one was really going onto it, and then they were also saying 7 was going to come down. They chased everyone off the block. Q. You said before, Chief, that you heard bullets going off. Approximately how many did you hear? A. Oh, it was like it was just constant. Constant. Whatever, I guess there were packages or something, and as they heated up, they were just pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. They were going off like at a steady rate.

It was pretty soon after they had left that Richie Zarillo, who works with EMS -- I believe he’s an OEM liaison --came running up to me. I was not on the ramp at this time. I was like almost at the sidewalk location. He said Steve, where’s the Chief? I have to tell him, you know I said tell him what, Richie? These buildings are in imminent danger of collapse. I said how do you know that, you know? So he ran with me. I ran over and grabbed Chief Ganci and said Chief, these buildings are in imminent danger of collapse. He looked up at me. Q. Had the second plane hit at this point? A. Yes, yes, the second plane hit. We saw the se cond plane hit -- if you want me to go back to when the second plane hit. I was told by Chief Ingram, who was a terrorist and hazmat-type guy, that we have got to be careful of secondary explosions or secondary devices. Who knew that the secondary device would be another plane. People actually saw the plane. You heard it, the closer it got. It just got louder and louder. I say that he throttled up as fast as he could. That’s what it sounded like, but I think he became more in earshot of us. And he just came in and put the plane into the building. As I’m looking up at this stuff that is going on up there now, I just like I’m saying to myself I’ve seen this in a movie. My whole recollection is going back to a movie or something I saw. I just saw this before. It’s like before my eyes. I don’t know if I ever did or didn’t, you know, in a dream. Then at that point within a few minutes, Richie Zarillo came up to me. I go back to that. He said that these buildings are in imminent danger of collapse~ T went right up to the Chief because I was a few steps away. I said Chief; these buildings are in imminent danger of collapse. And he said to me who would tell you something like that? And he looked at me and he had that determined --have to say probably scared look on his face, who would tell you something like that. I said Richie, come over here and tell the Chief what you just told me. He got the words out of his mouth. I think it was maybe 25, 30 seconds later, maybe, the building came down. Q. Did Zarillo ever say what he based that opinion on? A. Get that from? He said from OEM. We were trying to determine exactly how he got it. In retrospect, how did he get it? He was walking towards us. Was he coming towards us anyway and he got it over his radio? I think he told me he got it from Peruggia. There was like a relay type of thing, which maybe we should have and didn’t have our OEM radios on at the location. There was a lot of havoc going on.

Again, there was no fire coming out. So, when we got there, there was no fire and on the west side there was no smoke. But there was an obvious hole in the building. Actually, I was laying over him because he had no helmet or anything. Then we got up and we couldn’t see, but it started to clear to like a brown, cloudy smoke, and I hear pop, pop, pop, which sounded like gunfire to me. Then right after that I hear people screaming get down, get down. It’s not normal. I worked in the ghetto long enough that you get down. Q. Of course. A. Because it sounded like gunfire and I’ve heard gunfire before. It could have been something totally different. I have no idea. I grabbed the guy I was with and told him, hey, we have to get down; we have to get some cover. Joseph Pfeiffer, Battalion Chief, first highest ranking office on scene of attack on WTC-1 http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/nyregion/20050812_WTC_GRAPHIC/Pfeifer_Joseph. txt ___________________________________________________________________ So we were there a few minutes, and we started to walk, make our way through the lobby to the other side. I’d say we got maybe ten steps. We didn’t go very far. I heard sort of like a rumbling sound. We stopped, looked at each other, and took off. We just took off away from the doors. Instead of running out, we ran to our right, which would be toward the walls. It just happened really quick. I just remember running. Stack was in front of me. Henry went to my left with the other guys. In about a second or two, you just heard like a ba-ba-ba-boom, and everything just came down and everything was pitch-black. John Picarello, F.D.N.Y.

I fell to the floor. My camera bag opened up. The cameras went skidding across the floor. The windows started exploding in. I just rolled into the corner to protect myself from the glass. The next thing I knew, it was pitch-black. You couldn’t see in front of you. You couldn’t breathe. Every time you took a breath, you were just swallowing, you were gasping. I took my shirt off and wrapped it around my head so I could breathe. It felt like an eternity getting out of that building. I was disoriented. I knew the general idea of where I was. I was actually thinking about going out the windows where the glass was broke, but I figured people were still jumping and I didn’t know exactly what was going on outside. I’m thinking maybe the building snapped in half. I’m thinking maybe a bomb blew up. I’m thinking it could have been a nuclear. Richard Smiouskas, Lieutenant, F.D.N.Y. http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/nyregion/20050812_WTC_GRAPHIC/Smiouskas_Ric hard.txt ___________________________________________________________________ At that point I looked back and most of the people who were triaged in that area with the triage tags on them got up and ran. I took a quick glance at the building and while I didn’t see it falling, I saw a large section of it blasting out, which led me to believe it was just an explosion.

I later realized that the building ha d started to collapse already and this was the air being compressed and that is the floor that let go.

I looked up and you could actually see everything blew out on the one floor. I thought, geez, this looks like an explosion up there, it blew out. Then I guess in some sense of time we looked at it and realized, no, actually it just collapsed. That’s what blew out the windows, not that there was an explosion there but that windows blew out. The realization hit that it’s going to fall down, the top’s coming off. I was still thinking -- there was never a thought that this whole thing is coming down. I thought that that blew out and stuff is starting to fly down. The top is going to topple off there. F.D.N.Y. Battalion Chief Brian Dixon http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/nyregion/20050812_WTC_GRAPHIC/Dixon_Brian.tx t ___________________________________________________________________ We looked up at the building straight up, we were that close. All we saw was a puff of smoke coming from about 2 thirds of the way up. Some people thought it was an explosion. I don't think I remember that. I remember seeing; it looked like sparkling around one specific layer of the building. I assume now that that was either windows starting to collapse like tinsel or something. Then the building started to come down. My initial reaction was that this was exactly the way it looks when they show you those implosions on TV. Tom Fitzpatrick, Deputy Commissioner for Administration, F.D.N.Y., http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/nyregion/20050812_WTC_GRAPHIC/Fitzpatrick_To m.txt ___________________________________________________________________ Just as I go out of the building, one of my guys says hey Captain, the building is coming down. I looked over my shoulder and you could see the whole top of the south tower leaning towards us. It looked like it was coming over. You could see the windows pop out just like in the picture, looked like a movie. I saw one floor of windows pop out, like poof, poof. I saw one and a half floors pop out. It looked almost like an explosion. The whole top was teetering, and I really thought just the top of the building was falling off. I didn’t think there was any way we were going to make it out because just being this close; it looked like it’s leaning right on top of us. Steve Grabher, Battalion Chief, F.D.N.Y., http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/nyregion/20050812_WTC_GRAPHIC/Grabher_Steve. rtf ___________________________________________________________________ We both for whatever reason -- again, I don't know how valid this is with everything that was going on at that particular point in time, but for some reason I thought that when I looked in the direction of the Trade Center before it came down, before No. 2 came down, that I saw low-level flashes. In my conversation with Lieutenant Evangelista, never mentioning this to him, he questioned me and asked me if I saw low-level flashes in front of the building, and I agreed with him because I thought -- at that time I didn't know what it was."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 223 I mean, it could have been as a result of the building collapsing, things exploding, but I saw a flash, flash, flash, and then it looked like the building came down. You know like when they demolish a building, how when they blow up a building, when it falls down? That's what I thought I saw. And I didn't broach the topic to him, but he asked me. He said I don't know if I'm crazy, but I just wanted to ask you because you were standing right next to me. He said did you see anything by the building? And I said what do you mean by see anything? He said did you see any flashes? I said, yes, well, I thought it was just me. He said no, I saw them, too. Stephen Gregory, F.D.N.Y.

The pilot episode of the Lone Gunmen dealt specifically with a faction of the government engaged in a conspiracy to take over and fly via a remote control accessing the on-board aircraft electronic flight controls, a fully fuelled 727 into the World Trade Center in New York City. The aircraft involved in the government staged attack similarly began its flight from Logan Airport. Dialogue from the episode also reveals several striking coincidences that stagger credulity (my comments) : John Byers: What is scenario 12-D? We know it’s a wargame scenario that has to do with airline counter-terrorism. Why is it important enough to kill for? (Scenario 12-D is equivalent to Operation Northwoods, multiple live-fly wargames in operation on 9/11) Bertram Byers: Because it’s no longer a game. (Drill went live) John: If some terrorist group wants to act out this scenario, why target you for assassination? Bertram: It depends on who your terrorists are. (The Shadow-Government) John: The men who conceived of it in the first place. (Operation Northwoods) You’re saying our government plans to commit a terrorist act against a domestic airline. Bertram: There ya go. Indicting the entire government as usual. It’s a faction, a small faction. (Compartmentalization-Secret government) John: For what possible gain? (Cui Bono?) Bertram: The Cold War is over John. But with no clear enemy to stockpile against, the arms market is flat. But bring down a fully loaded 727 into the middle of New York City and you’ll find a dozen tin-pot dictators, all over the world just clamoring to take responsibility, and begging to be smart-bombed. (Cui Bono, target Afghanistan, Iraq, profit motive, exact city, exact building target, exact method of attack.) "},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 225 John: I can’t believe it. This is about increasing arms sales. (motive) Number of 9/11 elements identical or sufficiently similar to the broadcast episode: 8 City: New York, NY War-game scenarios: Operation Northwood’s, 5 military and FEMA drills on 9-11. Target: World Trade Center, civilian airline Method: Attack with remote controlled civilian airline Motive: Arms Sales Starting point: Boston Logan Blamed parties: Tin-pot dictators. Intended Result: False flag retaliator y war, smart bombing, arms sales. Do you care to figure out the mathematical odds of a TV episode containing eight of the major unique characteristics of the attacks on 9/11? Is eight unique characteristics enough for you to begin to cast greater doubt upon the government’s version of the attacks and who is to blame? Or maybe you might want to believe that Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda minions viewed that episode and a lightbulb went off and he got the plans rolling, got the financing, got the volunteers and them positioned and trained to fly with only a few months preparation. You buy that? "},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 226 Endnotes   1 Lincoln, Abraham. Quoted in The Empire of \"The City ,” by E.C.

This is an eleven year research program designed to produce and test drugs and biological agents that would be used for mind control and behavior modification. Six of the subprojects involved testing the agents on unwitting human beings. 1965) CIA and Department of Defense begin Project MKSEARCH, a program to develop a capability to manipulate human behavior through the use of mind-altering drugs 1966) CIA initiates Project MKOFTEN, a program to test the toxicological effects of certain drugs on humans and animals. (1967) CIA and Department of Defense implement Project MKNAOMI, successor to MKULTRA and designed to maintain, stockpile and test biological and chemical weapons.

Despite Dr. Delgado's outlandish statements before Congress, his work was financed by grants from the Office of Naval Research, the Air Force Aero-Medical Research La boratory, and the Public Health Foundation of Boston. Dr. Delgado was a pioneer of the technology of Electrical Stimulation of the Brain (ESB). The New York Times ran an article on May 17, 1965 entitled “Matador with a Radio Stops Wild Bull.” The story details Dr. Delgado's experiments at Yale Univer sity School of Medicine and work in the field at Cordova, Spain. The New York Times stated: \"Afternoon sunlight poured over the high wooden barriers into the ring, as the brave bull bore down on the unarmed matador, a scientist who had never faced fighting bull. But the charging animal's horn never reached the man behind the heavy red cape. Moments before that could happen, Dr. Delgado pre ssed a button on a small radio transmitter in his hand and the bull braked to a halt. Then he pressed another button on the transmitter, and the bull obediently turned to the right and trotted away. The bull was obeying commands in his brain that "},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 236       were being called forth by electrical stimulation by the radio signals to certain regions in which fine wires had been painlessly planted the day before.\" Archived copy of the NYT article can be found here: < http://www.wanttoknow.info/delgadobullnytimes.pdf > According to Dr. Delgado, experiments of this type have also been performed on humans.

The experiments are best known as a series of tests performed through Yale University, where a subject was told to administer an increasingly high level of electrical shock to a victim (an actor) atte mpting to learn a series of word relationships. The experiments were all variations on a theme: a unknowing participant (the subject-teacher) was brought to believe that s/he was participating in a learning study. The other two main participants were a man who posed as the student (the learner) and one who posed as the principal investigator (the authority figure). The subject-teacher was told that the learning would occur in this way: the student would be hooked up to an electric shock generator while the teacher would read a set of word pairs, which the student would repeat back. When the student missed one of the word pairs, he would be shocked by the \"teacher\" in increasingly higher shocks (the shocks increased in 15 volt increments), up to 450 volts (which was marked, along with the 435 volt mark, with XXX). Drawing the subjects for his experiment from a varied cross-section of contemporary American society, they were men, women, college educated or high school graduates, white and blue collar workers from every possible background. Milgram shows what \"normal\" people are capable of doing when they can justify their actions or deny responsibility. The frightening results showed the majority of subjects, at the bequest of the authority involved, applied the maximum voltage despite the begging and pleading of the victim to stop the test (the victim being an actor pretending to be shocked). Most subjects shocked the actor past maximum voltage, to lethal doses; they \"killed\" the actor, or would have killed if the experiment was \"real.\" With the exception of one single person, all the subjects obeyed each and every order issued by the authority figure no matter how brutal, many explaining that in real life they would never be able to do what they were in point of fact in the middle of doing. The one person who refused to participate did so because of what he had observed in Nazi Germany. That so many people willingly and in some cases eagerly inflicted nothing less than torture on others is unsettling, to be sure. More unsettling still is that the person who refused did so on the basis of acquired, as opposed to innate, values. Milgram, Stanley. Obedience to Authority: An Experimental View .

The passage in question is more accurately translated as \"In the actions of all men, and especially of princes who are not subject to a court of appeal, we must always look to the end. Let a prince, therefore, win victories and uphold his state; his methods will always be considered worthy, and everyone will praise them, because the masses are always impressed by the superficial appearance of things, and by the outcome of an enterprise.

Bernstein writes: “Alsop is one of more than 400 American journalists who in the past 25 years have secretly carried out assignments for the Central Intelligence Agency according to documents on file at CIA headquarters. Some of these journalists' relationships with the Agency were tacit; some were explicit. There was cooperation, accommodation and overlap. Journalists provided a full range of clandestine services -- from simple intelligence-gathering to serving as go-betweens with spies in Communist countries. Reporters shared their notebooks with the CIA. Editors shared their staffs. Some of the journalists were Pulitzer Prize winners, distinguished reporters who considered themselves ambassadors without portfolio for their country. Most were less exalted: foreign correspon dents who found that their association with the Agency helped their work; stringers and freelancers who were as interested in the derring-do of the spy business as in filing articles; and, the smallest category, full-time CIA employees masquerading as journalists abroad. In many instances, CIA docu ments show, journalists were engaged to perform tasks for the CIA with the consent of the managements of America's leading news organizations. Among the executives who lent their cooperation to the Agency were William Paley of the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), Henry Luce of Time Inc ., Arthur Hays Sulzberger of the New York Times , Barry Bingham Sr. of the Louisville Courier-Journal , and James Copley of the Copley News Services. Other organizations which cooperated with the CIA include the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), the Associated Press, United Press International, Reuters, Hearst Newspapers, Scripps-Howard, Newsweek magazine, the Mutual Broadcasting System, the Miami Herald and the old Saturday Evening Post and New York Herald-Tribune. By far the most valuable of these associations, according to CIA officials, have been with the New York Times , CBS and Time Inc . 11 Guyatt, David. “Subverting the Media” DeepBlackLies.co.uk < http://www.deepblacklies.co.uk/subverting_the_media.htm > 12 Rockefeller, David.

If the elite is ruthless they may simply decide to exterminate the mass of humanity. If they are humane they may use propaganda or other psychological or biological techniques to reduce the birth rate until the mass of humanity becomes extinct, leaving the world to the elite. Or, if the elite consists of soft-hearted liberals, they may decide to play the role of good shepherds to the rest of the human race. They will see to it that everyone's physical needs are satisfied, that all children are raised under psychologically hygienic conditions, that everyone has a wholesome hobby to keep him busy, and that anyone who may become dissatisfied undergoes \"treatment\" to cu re his \"problem.\" Of course, life will be so purposeless that people will have to be biologically or psychologically engineered either to remove their need for the power process or make them \"sublimate\" their drive for power into some harmless hobby.

IBM and the Holocaust. Only after Jews were identified -- a massive and complex task that Hitler wanted done immediately -- could they be targeted for efficient asset confiscation, ghettoization, deportation, enslaved labor, and, ultimately, annihilation. It was a cross- "},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"The Big Lie” 9/11 and the Government’s Complicity in Mass Murder 260       tabulation and organizational challenge so monumental, it called for a computer. Of course, in the 1930s no computer existed. But IBM's Hollerith punch card technology did exist. Aided by the company's custom-designed and constantly updated Ho llerith systems, Hitler was able to automate his persecution of the Jews. Historians have always been amazed at the speed and accuracy with which the Nazis were able to identify and locate European Jewry. Until now, the pieces of this puzzle have never been fully assembled. The fact is, IBM technology was used to organize nearly everything in Germany and then Nazi Europe, from the identification of the Jews in censuses, registrations, and ancestral tracing programs to the running of railroads and organizing of concentration camp slave labor. IBM and its German subsidiary custom-designed complex solutions, one by one, anticipating the Reich's needs. They did not merely sell the machines and walk away. Instead, IBM leased these machines for high fees and became the sole source of the billions of punch cards Hitler needed. < http://www.ibmandtheholocaust.com > 113 < http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four > < http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World >< http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Clockwork_Or ange > 114 George Orwell, Nineteen Eighty-Four , O’Brien to Winston: “If you want a vision of the future, Winston, imagine a boot stamping on a human face forever.” 115 Bigioni, Paul.

They will say that they might as well draw examples from those countries as from Great Britain, and they will tell you that there is such a necessity of strengthening the arm of government, that they must have a criminal equity, and extort confession by torture, in order to punish with still more relentless severity. We are then lost and undone.” < http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendVIIIs13.html > 164 Quote by Roosevelt in the Kansas City Star , 7 May 1918. < http://www.theodoreroosevelt.org/life/quotes.htm > 165 Smith, R.
