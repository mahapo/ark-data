STIMSONThomas Robert Malthus, called Bob or Robert within his family, was born in 1766at The Rookery, a country house in Wescott, near Dorking in Surrey, the sixthchild of Daniel and Henrietta Malthus. Daniel Malthus was a country gentlemen ofindependent means and moderately radical opinions, an acquaintance of both DavidHume and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and an inspired devotee of the latter. Thedetails of the young Malthus’s life in the bosom of his large and closelyintermarried family circle are reminiscent of a Jane Austen novel: the“affectionate and indulgent” mother of well-established societal standing; themercurial, imperative, and peripatetic father.1 [09_Introduction.html#id_1643]Add to this inner circle the sensitive but dissolute older brother living abroadand who, dying prematurely, left six stepchildren, four legitimate heirs, andone “natural child”;2 [09_Introduction.html#id_1641] the four sisters andseemingly endless numbers of intermarried, maiden, and widowed aunts, togetherwith many cousins with their numerous offspring, several of whom did not surviveinfancy.3 [09_Introduction.html#id_1639] Malthus’s parents were second cousinsand were themselves the product of more than a century of intermarriage amongfour families: the Daltons, Eckersalls, Malthuses, and Grahams. Malthus’s motherwas a Graham; his eventual wife and cousin, Harriet, an Eckersall. Many of thesemarriages arose from the proximity of professional association, as the Daltons,Eckersalls, and Malthuses were historically in some form of royal service, somefrom the time of Charles II. Daniel Graham (1695–1778) was Apothecary to GeorgeII and George III, and Malthus’s grandfather on his mother’s side, while ThomasGraham, Apothecary to George I and George II, was a direct lineal forebear ofboth of Malthus’s parents.Daniel Malthus kept his family in a state of almost perpetual movement from onecountry house to another from 1768 until 1787. In the midst of his family’scontinual dislocations, young Robert’s education was largely entrusted to othersand mostly away from home. His early education fell under the guidance of Rev.Richard Graves at the Claverton Rectory near Bath, and from 1782 under thepersonal direction of Gilbert Wakefield at the Warrington Dissenting Academy andin Wakefield’s own home in Lancashire. From 1784, Malthus studied – as Wakefieldhad done – at Jesus College, Cambridge, until graduating as Ninth Wrangler inmathematics, attaining the ninth highest First Class degree in that subject, in1788. Malthus would later be elected a Fellow of the college in 1793.Shortly after leaving Cambridge, in 1789, Malthus became a country curate in theChurch of England, licensed by the Bishop of Winchester to serve the remotecuracy of Okewood in the parish of Wotton, Surrey. Such an unlikely choice ofcareer by such an obviously talented young intellect met with Malthus’s ownexpressed desire for “a retired living in the country,” and has been partiallyexplained by the fact that Malthus suffered from birth from a devastatingphysical handicap due to a harelip and cleft palate.4[09_Introduction.html#id_1637] While his personal appearance was very littleaffected, and his deformity almost never discussed in public or privatecommunications, the physical challenge of speaking must have been great, and hisspeech in the few rare instances it has been noted in print by hiscontemporaries was described as “stammering” and “horrid,” or more generously as“the vowels sonorous, whatever might become of the consonants.”5[09_Introduction.html#id_1635]As his biographer the late Patricia James has noted, it was “impossible to tellfrom the records how long young Robert actively served this curacy.” 6[09_Introduction.html#id_1633] However, the parish records of Okewood containother pieces of information of relevance concerning Malthus’s time there. Thecurate at Okewood, with its remote but beautiful thirteenth-century chapel, wasso poor it lacked even a heating stove for the chapel until the mid-nineteenthcentury.7 [09_Introduction.html#id_1631] Until 1829, there was no residence forthe curate, and Malthus would have had to ride horseback nine miles to serve hisparishioners. Too isolated to be licensed to perform marriages, Okewood Chapel’seighteenth-century register chronicled relatively few burials but a “prodigiousnumber of baptisms, all children of the poor.”8 [09_Introduction.html#id_1629]As the entire Register of Okewood is reported to have contained not oneindividual described as “Esquire,” the country folk who labored throughMalthus’s sermons and who brought their infants for baptism from a pewter bowlwould have been basically those common laborers at the very bottom of asubsistence economy, and whose children survived on a basic diet of bread.Malthus would thus powerfully describe them in 1798:The sons and daughters of peasants will not be found such rosy cherubs in reallife, as they are described in romances. It cannot fail to be remarked by thosewho live much in the country, that the sons of labourers are very apt to bestunted in their growth, and are a long while arriving at maturity. Boys thatyou would guess to be fourteen or fifteen, are, upon enquiry, frequently foundto be eighteen or nineteen.9 [09_Introduction.html#id_1627]Despite the obvious personal challenges of public speaking, Malthus was alsomade Rector of Walesby in Lincolnshire in 1803, with its living of just overthree hundred pounds per annum, which when combined with other sources of incomeenabled him in 1804 to marry his second cousin Harriet Eckersall, and providedhim with a permanent income for the remainder of his life.10[09_Introduction.html#id_1625] A year later, Malthus additionally took up aposition as Professor of Political Economy at the newly founded East-IndiaCollege of Haileybury in Hertfordshire, a position which he also held until hisdeath. Malthus’s post at the East-India College was the first of its kind inEngland, and his movement from curate to professor of political economyreflected little alteration in the importance or content of his theologicalcommitments. Historian Boyd Hilton has described the outset of the nineteenthcentury as one of an “age of atonement” positioned between Britain’s two greatages of empire.11 [09_Introduction.html#id_1623] Malthus’s more than two decadesof training the young (between the ages of fifteen and eighteen), soon-to-becivil servants of the East India Company have been argued to be largelysynchronous with his ever-closer alignment to the theological-utilitarianbeliefs of the noted clergyman, natural theologian, and moral and politicalphilosopher William Paley.Paley’s theology has been characterized by some historians of the period asessentially a mainstream Church of England position which saw the world as astate of trial and one that gave believers a chance to change their ways andmodify their behavior.12 [09_Introduction.html#id_1621] The Paleyite position,suggesting a belief in the need for measuring man’s commitment to moralprinciple by his strict attention to the consequences of his actions, would seemheuristically well-matched to the mission of imbuing newly minted administratorsfor the Indian service with the values of a practical theology of discipline andmoral restraint. In drawing on a kind of Paleyite utilitarianism, Malthusadopted an understanding of Christian moral life that was indeed utilitarian incharacter, yet could never be epitomized by the terms of “implicit secularutilitarianism” that would render him “indistinguishable from those Benthamiteswho were to provide the early mainstay of neo-Malthusianism.”13[09_Introduction.html#id_1619] Nevertheless, the Christian values or theodicywhich Malthus espoused might be as easily discovered through attention to thefirst (1798) and second editions (1803) of his Essay on the Principle ofPopulation, and his classes on political economy, as through his observance ofany strictly formal religious theology. Indeed, much contemporary scholarship onMalthus has persuasively argued that considerations of Malthus’s writings onpopulation and political economy should not be sharply disengaged from histheological commitments.14 [09_Introduction.html#id_1617] While questions ofreligion and theodicy remained important in the development of Malthus’sprinciple of population, certainly of great if not equal importance in shapingMalthus’s demographic, moral, and political economic thinking in the periodbetween 1798 and 1803 were writings of the political economist Adam Smith andthe utopian writer William Godwin. Malthus’s engagement with the work of bothSmith and Godwin serve to place the 1803 edition of the Essay within the contextof social, political, and economic reform in the early decades of the nineteenthcentury.Malthus assigned the work of Adam Smith a most important place in his thoughtand writing, and for many years harbored the idea of bringing out his ownedition of the Wealth of Nations.15 [09_Introduction.html#id_1615] Whetherserving as the anvil in forging Malthus’s attack in the first edition of theEssay on Population on the speculative visions (“phantom of the imagination”) ofWilliam Godwin and Condorcet, or as his later point of departure in writing thePrinciples of Political Economy (1820) in offering critical commentary on DavidRicardo’s new political economy, Smith’s orienting influence is there.16[09_Introduction.html#id_1613] This is not surprising, as Malthus wasconsistently a reactive and critical thinker, rather than a consummate theorist.His very first and unpublished work, “The Crisis,” as well as the unsigned firstEssay, were reactive precisely in this sense. However, despite what might bedescribed as Smith’s formative influence in Malthus’s work, this is not, ofcourse, how many of his critics and commentators from his own time to thepresent have tended to see their relationship.17 [09_Introduction.html#id_1611]For example, when Malthus chose in the pages of the 1824 Quarterly Review toopenly claim Smith as his ally in an emerging disciplinary divide between oldand “new” schools of political economy,18 [09_Introduction.html#id_1609] JohnStuart Mill returned fire in the pages of the Westminster Review arguing thatthe difficulty of reconciling Malthus and Smith was insuperable.19[09_Introduction.html#id_1607]The debate was joined, and then as now Malthus has been required to carry a twinburden. On the one hand, the Essay in his own time was seen as opposing Smith’ssystematic thought with a loosely and erroneously labeled “dismal science,” andof functioning as a demoralizer of an existing moral economy.20[09_Introduction.html#id_1605] Beginning with Karl Polanyi in the twentiethcentury, commentators on the Smith-Malthus debate have persistently maintainedthis focus on the Essay in order to highlight Malthus’s moral impoverishment ofSmith’s political economy through the introduction of a form of naturalismunderstood as biological reductionism. On the other hand, it has been suggestedthat Malthus’s political economy presented a more extreme version of Smithianconcepts such as the invisible hand, unintended consequences, or even, in hisopposition to the Poor Law, laissez-faire. Although scholars recognize that thiswas not perhaps Malthus’s own perception of his enterprise, they have arguedthat in his hands, “more harshly than Smith, more practically than Mandeville,”private virtue had become “apparently pernicious” and “vice a source ofbenefit.”21 [09_Introduction.html#id_1603] Certainly, Malthus’s theory ofpopulation is read fairly by some scholars to have exceeded Smith’s own relianceon unintended consequences, perhaps even to serve as a veritable test case forthat “doctrine.”22 [09_Introduction.html#id_1601] Thus, opinion remains sharplydivided over whether Malthus’s effort in the first edition of the Essay shouldbe understood as a direct challenge and subversion of Smith’s theory ofprogress,23 [09_Introduction.html#id_1599] or as at least originally, an actualdefense of Smith’s moral and political economy from the critique leveled byanother leading thinker of the eighteenth century, William Godwin.Malthus’s initial, unpublished consideration of this question was inspired bysocial and political upheaval, as its title – “The Crisis” – readily confirms.24[09_Introduction.html#id_1597] The crisis confronting Malthus appeared to taketwo forms: the continued political threat to Britain of the effects of animploding French Revolution and war with France, and the visible “distresses anddissatisfactions” of a growing and increasingly immiserated rural laboring classat home.25 [09_Introduction.html#id_1595] The two were being dramaticallybrought together in his mind by a series of events involving the splits anddefections occurring in the William Pitt administration in opposition to thewar, public repression of protest, and high taxation consequent to it, and thesimultaneous political debate engendered by “Mr. Pitt’s Poor Law Bill.” Malthushad yet to arrive at or at least record any systematic understanding of apopulation principle that might inform these debates.At the time, Malthus had no theoretical or even systematic answer to thisquestion. To address the immediate political crisis which French politics andthe war were engendering in Britain under Pitt’s administration, he proposed apurely practical solution – “the revival of the true Whig principles in a bodyof the community sufficiently numerous and powerful to snatch the object ofcontention from the opposing factions,” which was to be found, he believed, inthe “sense and reason of the country gentleman, and the middle classes ofsociety.”26 [09_Introduction.html#id_1593] On the question of the means by whichthe crisis of the rural poor was to be alleviated, Malthus was more circumspect,supporting the Pitt proposal for continued parish relief but registeringuncertainty about the principles that supported it. Acknowledging England’sgrowing number of indigent laboring poor, Malthus had at this point nothingsystematic to say and could only comment in passing: “On the subject ofpopulation, I cannot agree with Archdeacon Paley, who says, that the quantity ofhappiness in any country is best measured by the number of people. Increasingpopulation is the most certain possible sign of the happiness and prosperity ofa state; but the actual population may only be a sign of the happiness that ispast.”27 [09_Introduction.html#id_1591]However, when Malthus turned to Godwin’s essay on “Avarice and Profusion,” inThe Enquirer (1797), together with Godwin’s An Enquiry into Political Justiceand Its Influence on General Virtue and Happiness (1793), he found just such aneffort to offer a principled analysis of the very political and economic criseshe was observing. It was in his opinion, however, a deeply flawed and – in thecontext of the times – unsettling proposal to connect a theory of man’sperfectible nature to a principle of diminishing population, and to enunciate aroot-and-branch reform of both the constitution and the advancing commercialsociety over which it governed. In what might be described as Godwin’sfuturistic utopia of Enlightenment rationalism, reason would so triumph overselfish interest thatThe men therefore who exist when the earth shall refuse itself to a moreextended population, will cease to propagate, for they will no longer have anymotive, either of error or duty, to induce them. In addition to this they willperhaps be immortal. The whole will be a people of men, and not of children.Generation will not succeed generation, nor truth have in a certain degree torecommence her career at the end of every thirty years. There will be no war, nocrimes, no administration of justice as it is called, and no government.28[09_Introduction.html#id_1589]Malthus published a response. He found Godwin’s claims wholly lacking in eitherempirical or genuine logical thought, and felt Godwin’s “beautiful” system was“little better than a dream, a beautiful phantom of the imagination.”29[09_Introduction.html#id_1587] Malthus chose to counter Godwin in a small,polemical, and unsigned piece, An Essay on the Principle of Population, whichMalthus chose to publicly acknowledge five years after its original publicationin 1798. The reaction to the Essay was immediate and in most instancesvitriolic.30 [09_Introduction.html#id_1585]While Malthus published but one edition of his Principles of Political Economy(1820) during his lifetime,31 [09_Introduction.html#id_1583] he produced nofewer than six editions of the Essay, and in 1803 offered that “collection of agreater number of facts in elucidation of the general argument,” which heacknowledged in his original preface remained to be supplied.32[09_Introduction.html#id_1581] Indeed, while Malthus continued to make changesand adjustments through all the editions, it was clearly the second, 1803edition that massively revised and reordered the original Essay to nearly fourtimes its original length and has since been characterized as effectively a“separate work.”33 [09_Introduction.html#id_1579] It is this edition thatremains the most fundamental statement of his work on population – the GreatQuarto – and it is upon this edition that all later corrections and revisions ofthe four following editions on which he spent the remainder of his life (1806,1807, 1817, 1826) would be based. Thus, it must be considered the definitivetext upon which Malthus placed his imprimatur and to which his innumerablecritics responded. Importantly, it is the 1803 edition that confirmed Malthus’sreputation as the leading political economist of the day until Ricardo’sremarkable Principles of Political Economy and Taxation appeared in 1817.Malthus’s population principle was to remain a basic assumption of the writingsof all the classical political economists up to and including John Stuart Mill.The Great Quarto reflected a significant period of travel, as well as anextensive body of historical research and empirical observation of thedemographics, climatic conditions, commodity prices, laws, and public servicesundertaken by Malthus in Scandinavia and continental Europe between 1799 and1803. This material would become the basis of the two entirely new books 1 and 2of the 1803 edition, and drew extensively upon his journals made during asix-month tour of Hamburg, the Duchies of Schleswig-Holstein, Denmark, Norway,Sweden, and Russia in 1799. He then traveled to France and Switzerland with hisfamily and Harriet Eckersall between May and October 1802. Reaching beyond thematerial of his own observations and travel journals of the period, Malthusfilled the twenty-six chapters of these two new books 1 and 2 with materialprodigiously mined from the empirical, statistical, and historical research ofothers, including François Le Vaillant’s personal 1790 account, Voyage dansl’intérieur de l’Afrique; Peter Simon Pallas’s volumes of the 1780s ondiscoveries and voyages in different parts of the Russian Empire; Sir GeorgeStaunton’s Embassy to China of 1797; and Jean Baptiste Duhalde’s massiveeighteenth-century account of China, The General History of China ContainingGeographical, Historical, Chronological, Political and Physical Description ofthe Empire of China. Chinese-Tartary, Corea and Tibet, Including an Exact andParticular Account of Their Customs, Manners, Ceremonies, Religion, Arts andSciences.34 [09_Introduction.html#id_1577] As his footnotes to the 1803 Essaydocument, Malthus drew also from the historical research of others on AncientGreece and Rome, as well as from his exploration of the writings of Plato,Aristotle, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Julius Caesar, Plutarch, Tacitus, andLivy, and on comments upon climate in China by Montesquieu, and upon Roman andGreek cultural and political practices by David Hume and Edward Gibbon.Stung by the charges of unoriginality and intellectual borrowing made about the1798 Essay, or perhaps simply inspired to massively enlarge the support for itsfundamental argument, Malthus not only extended his project but undertooksignificant alterations in argument and inductive method, rewrote as well asadded entirely new sections to the work, and widely acknowledged the work ofothers both in the preface and in copious notes to the work. The preface of the1803 edition went to some length to reiterate for readers that in writing theoriginal edition of the Essay while tucked away in the country, Malthus had hadonly available to him the likes of David Hume, Adam Smith, and the Revs. RobertWallace and Richard Price. However, Malthus acknowledged that in the revisionsundertaken for the 1803 edition, he had consulted as well the writings ofBenjamin Franklin, the French économistes, Montesquieu, Sir James Steuart,Arthur Young, and Rev. Joseph Townsend. Indeed, Benjamin Franklin mightlegitimately be claimed to have anticipated several of Malthus’s early ideas onpopulation. However, with the publication of the second, 1803 edition, whichMalthus produced – as Patricia James informs us – in an unknown “series ofgarrets” rented in London, Malthus moved far beyond these earlier thinkers inhis own ability to collect and process an unparalleled research trove ofdemographic and economic data, and to connect population theory to poverty,wealth, and the growth of capital.35 [09_Introduction.html#id_1575]Malthus signaled the important advancement of his aims and contribution in theGreat Quarto with the significant alteration of its title from that of aconsideration of the principle of population “as it effects the futureimprovement of society, with remarks on the speculations of Mr Godwin, M.Condorcet, and other writers,” to its ambitious restatement of 1803: An Essay onthe Principle of Population; or, A View of Its Past and Present Effects on HumanHappiness; with an Inquiry into Our Prospects Respecting the Future Removal orMitigation of the Evils Which It Occasions. Commentators reflecting on thealteration and expansion of the 1803 edition, such as E. A. Wrigley, have notedthat it consolidated Malthus’s mature position, and that despite new materialadded to the later editions and the significant later alteration of the order ofchapters, the work as a whole after the 1803 edition remained “recognizably thesame”36 [09_Introduction.html#id_1573] The caesura created between his originalpolemic and the nearly quadrupled enlargement and alterations made in 1803 isdefinitive.37 [09_Introduction.html#id_1571] Malthus himself acknowledged thenewness of the work at the conclusion of its preface, suggesting that“[t]hroughout the whole of the present work, I have so far differed in principlefrom the former, as to suppose another check to population possible, which doesnot strictly come under the head either of vice or misery.”38[09_Introduction.html#id_1569] Malthus continued to maintain, throughout all theeditions, his principle that population, if unchecked, had the tendency tooutstrip the means of subsistence. Yet, importantly, Malthus proceeded in thefirst chapter of the 1803 to formally label this new preventive check as “moralrestraint,” arguing that “of the preventive checks, that which is not followedby irregular gratifications, may properly be termed moral restraint.”39[09_Introduction.html#id_1567]The locus of this more complex preventive check was to be found in theregulating powers of a restraint from marriage, and Malthus clearly intendedthat the imputation of such a forward-thinking capacity in the laboring poorwould not only “soften some of the harshest conclusions of the first essay” butalso elevate the perception of his judgment of their capacity to address whatwere not unforeseen consequences of very early marriage.40[09_Introduction.html#id_1565] The intended conclusion was that “the poverty andmisery which prevail among the lower classes of society” was not “absolutelyirremediable.”41 [09_Introduction.html#id_1563] Certainly other scholars havenoted that Malthus followed in these aims a kind of “theological utilitarian”belief in the need for measuring man’s commitment to moral principle by his“strict attention” to the consequences of his actions.42[09_Introduction.html#id_1561]The impact of the Great Quarto of 1803 was immediately registered with positive,if not uncritical, reviews in the Monthly Review, the Imperial Review, and theAnglican periodical British Critic. And while Malthus’s harshest criticspersisted among poets and literary essayists such as Robert Southey and WilliamHazlitt, among moralists such as William Cobbett, and economic reformers such asRobert Owen, and, later, by Nassau William Senior, the 1803 edition was nowrecognized as having moved beyond “a brilliant a priori polemic” to “a weightyempirical treatise and a third and fourth edition followed in 1806 and 1807.”43[09_Introduction.html#id_1559] In Europe, the Quarto found readers through itsGerman (1807) and French (1809) translations. In America, Thomas Jefferson wroteto Joseph Priestley in January 1804 offering the following assessment ofMalthus’s Quarto: “Have you seen the new work of Malthus on population? It isone of the ablest I have ever seen. Although his main object is to delineate theeffects of redundancy of population, and to test the poor laws of England, andother palliations for that evil, several important questions in politicaleconomy, allied to his subject incidentally, are treated with a masterlyhand.”44 [09_Introduction.html#id_1557] Jefferson wrote in a similarly laudatoryvein only a few days later to the French political economist Jean Baptiste Say,suggesting that he found it a work of “sound logic, in which some of theopinions of Adam Smith as well as of the economists, are examined.”45[09_Introduction.html#id_1555]The influence and importance of Malthus’s work on population as definitivelydeveloped in the 1803 Quarto has been historically recognized to reach well intothe middle and later decades of the nineteenth century in the writings ofCharles Darwin and Herbert Spencer, and well beyond them to the debates over the“population bomb” of the mid-late twentieth century. Malthus’s twentieth-centurybiographer Patricia James alluded to his immediate influence in the first threedecades of the nineteenth century when she wrote that the “currency” of the word“Malthusian” in the first three decades of that century could perhaps “becompared with the ‘Freudian’ about a century later, which was used by people whohad little idea who Freud was, when or where he worked, or even what tenets heheld.”46 [09_Introduction.html#id_1553] Malthus’s thought, and most importantlyhis “principle,” seemed to be assumed ever after, by writers of literature andof political and social thought, to be commonly understood.Yet, more systematic studies of the tremendous resonance and impact of Malthus’sEssay are even now appearing, as with the five original, critical, andinterpretive essays which accompany this complete edition of Malthus’s GreatQuarto of 1803, An Essay on the Principle of Population, by scholars in thefields of economic, political, and social history; demography; economics; andEnglish literature.47 [09_Introduction.html#id_1551] The contributors to thisvolume were each tasked with addressing, in a set of new essays for readers andstudents of Malthus, what might be taken to be a signal or importantcontribution with regard to their own fields. What emerges in the essays thatfollow is a wide-ranging consideration of Malthus’s legacy which makes nopretense to be synoptic, but rather to suggest the remarkably creative andinterdisciplinary significance of Malthus’s impact both in its scope andcharacter. In the view of many at work in these and other scholarly disciplines,the 250th anniversary of Malthus’s birth has reinforced the need for a relaunchof his most famous work in its entirety, reissuing a complete version of hisbenchmark text that restores parts of the original now of current and particularinterest both to historians and interdisciplinary scholars of the academic worldconcerned with what can be described as “global” issues.In this volume, the importance of the 1803 Essay is the subject of renewedhistorical interest taken up in the essays by Niall O’Flaherty and DeborahValenze. O’Flaherty’s essay, “Malthus and the History of Population,”successfully reorients contemporary scholarly understanding of just what Malthusmight be understood to have been doing in terms of both his method and hispolitical thought in the 1803 revision, by giving greater weight to thehistorical context of his theory, particularly as the principle of populationpurports to be an argument based on historical observation. It is this record ofhuman experience, O’Flaherty suggests, “that comprises the ‘scientific’underpinning” of all Malthus’s practical and policy recommendations. The essayby Deborah Valenze, “The Tortoise and the Hare: Thomas Robert Malthus as NaturalPhilosopher,” enlarges upon the theme of Malthus’s focus on methodology in“natural philosophy” by placing his revisions of the first Essay within theframework of his need to “reinforce” history with hard data, and thus to follow“two paths” of research into the natural world. Malthus’s tours of Scandinavia,first through Germany and Denmark, then northward into Sweden and Norway,offered Malthus an opportunity “of gleaning information on reproduction andsurvival shaped by minimal interference of modernizing forces.” Valenze offers afascinating look at Malthus’s methods of correlating vast amounts ofmeteorological data on European weather patterns and temperature fluctuations tobuttress his more general theories on the power of nature and the balance of“prudential restraint” necessary to sustainable population growth. As Valenzenotes, “Malthus’s understanding of rural life, supported by his empiricalnatural philosophy, belonged to a universe in which nature held the trump cardcapable of negating all efforts to match agricultural output with the level ofpopulation.” This view of nature was the basis of Malthus’s comparison of therelative speed of productive growth to that of population as a race between atortoise and a hare. However, Valenze demonstrates that over time and in hismore focused political economic writing, “the fury of Malthus’s concept ofnature diminished, as it hovered over a carefully planned notion of economiclife only distantly related to the communal table in Norway.”E. A. Wrigley picks up the population principle as an element of emergingclassical political economy in his essay “The Preventive Check and the Poor Law:The Malthusian Model and Its Implications.” Wrigley notes that Malthus “sharedwith the other classical economists the same concern about the implications ofthe impossibility of overcoming the ceiling set to material production by thelimited amount of cultivatable land, but he added a further consideration thatreinforced and extended his concern.” This consideration was his belief in thenature of two progressions – population growth and diminishing agriculturaloutput – which would produce an ineliminable tension between population andproduction without the operation of either preventive checks or moral restraint.However, as Wrigley notes, the nature of the relationship between productivecapacity and population was changing during Malthus’s lifetime “in ways thatmade his model of their linkages increasingly inapplicable.” Yet Wrigley alsonotes that one of Malthus’s most admired characteristics by later economistssuch as John Maynard Keynes was his willingness to modify his views based onempirical evidence. And evidence for this can be found in the 1803 edition,which Wrigley touches upon in his essay.The contemporary economist and game theorist Kenneth Binmore reconsiders thequestion “Malthusian Economics: Right or Wrong?” in a quintessentially moderneconomic theorist’s consideration for the volume. Binmore suggests that noequations or other technicalities are needed to confirm that a properly statedversion of this Malthusian doctrine is necessarily correct. Binmore rehearsessome of the strongest contemporary claims resisting what he interprets as themost general Malthusian principle – that something cannot grow without bound ifthere is a bound which it cannot exceed. He suggests that contemporaryresistance to this principle has rested on technological growth and advances inscientific food production rather than a continued focus on population control.In a fascinating yet contrarian argument, Binmore suggests that the wager ontechnology growth rather than population restraint is a very uncertain one. Inan important sense, Binmore’s reflections on the continuing contemporary policyrelevance of Malthus’s perspective revive something of the spirit of those whoremarked that Malthus and his concerns with scarcity had been buried many times,but that “anyone who has been buried so often cannot be entirely dead.”48[09_Introduction.html#page_xxx]The final essay for the volume reaches beyond Malthus’s influence in eithernatural science or economics and takes up his afterlife in literature. In “TheCultural and Literary Significance of the 1803 Essay,” Karen O’Brien exploresthe considerable cultural and literary influence of Malthus’s work when set inthe political, social, and cultural contexts of the first few decades after itspublication: “The Napoleonic wars, political controversy about poverty and foodscarcity, cultural debate about the rate and age of marriage, and, morespecifically, the significance of the findings of the first British censuses of1801, 1811, and 1821.” O’Brien notes that the “disconnected subhistory of thepoorer part of mankind,” together with the significance of the “cognitivedeficit” which Malthus ascribed to those members of society most likely to beaffected by the “positive check,” was not lost on the Romantic anti-Malthusiansand other early critics of the Essay such as William Wordsworth in the LyricalBallads of 1798. However, Words worth’s perspective altered by 1814 to offermore a plea for moral and religious education, which Malthus shared in TheExcursion. Juxtaposed to a Romantic conservatism that found its origins “in thepowerful negative inspiration of Malthus’s ideas,” O’Brien chronicles otherkinds of literary and didactic writings of the period that drew upon Malthus fora new type of literary realism and advocated for individual moral responsibilityin the face of hostile economic and social conditions. Beyond the morefrequently referenced Evangelical economists thought to take up the Malthusianproblem, O’Brien focuses on the work of literary figures, such as the poetGeorge Crabbe, a great favorite with Jane Austen, and Austen herself, as well asother women writers of importance – Maria Edgeworth (Castle Rackrent, 1800),Elizabeth Hamilton, George Eliot (Adam Bede, 1859), Elizabeth Gaskell (MaryBarton, 1848), and Harriet Martineau (Illustrations of Political Economy,1832–1834) – to suggest the depth and range of the Essay’s literary and culturalreach.The volume’s editor has taken the position that the contributors’ essays areintended to introduce educated readers and scholars to a diverse set ofcontemporary interdisciplinary understandings and approaches to thewide-reaching impact of Malthus’s work, rather than to attempt to settle in asingle place a myriad of interpretive debates. The very breadth of impact of the1803 edition of the Essay on so many fields of the humanities and socialsciences has stimulated multiple approaches to thinking about this pivotal workand has mitigated against the effort either to impose a single interpretiveframework or to attempt to weave one connective tissue through the interpretiveessays. As such, this volume captures the renewed intervention into thepolitical and cultural impact of a profoundly influential work of politicaleconomic thinking in the early and mid-decades of the nineteenth century. It isour hope that this volume will be of great use to both students and scholars ofMalthus, of the history of political and economic thought, and of theintellectual and social history of the period. It conveys as well our confidencein the continued resonance and significance of T. R. Malthus’s thought toscholarly and contemporary debate even in the twenty-first century.NOTES1 [09_Introduction.html#id_1642]. Patricia James, Population Malthus: His Lifeand Time (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1979), 13. Malthus died after abrief illness on 29 December 1834 from what is generally believed to have beenheart disease or some disorder of the heart. He is buried in Bath Abbey. Many ofthe most important details of Malthus’s life and family, and much of what weknow of the personal context of his work, we know thanks to this monumentalbiography by James, based on nearly twenty years of biographical research intohis personal and family papers, and in the public records. James has given usnot only Malthus’s definitive biography but also a definitive, two-volumevariorum edition of his masterwork, An Essay on the Principle of Population,based on the 1803 edition with the variora of 1806, 1807, 1816, and 1826(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989). James has given us as well animmensely valuable edition of The Travel Diaries of T. R. Malthus (Cambridge:Cambridge University Press, 1966), including the Scandinavian journal from 1799,when the second edition of the Essay was already in the planning, and from hisContinental travels in 1810, 1825, and 1826. James’s unrivalled research aspresented in these three scholarly resource works has been drawn upon for anumber of details concerning Malthus’s life and travels discussed below. Inaddition, important contemporary reflections on Malthus’s life and hishistorical significance have been recently brought to light by Robert Mayhew’sbiography, Malthus: The Life and Legacies of an Untimely Prophet (Cambridge,Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2014).

Both consider aspects of an answer offered most frequently byhistorians, which is to recur to Malthus’s status as an Anglican priest. Itwould seem important to add as well that Malthus’s objections to effective birthcontrol were consonant with his theological opinions about the providentialpurposes served by population pressures, and would not be fairly dismissed asthe emanations of any personal shyness or prudery. Indeed, I am reminded thatMalthus was certainly aware that his proposals for the delay of marriage couldnot entirely alleviate the pressures of population growth as he understood them,and that the vices of prostitution and abortion were the likely byproducts ofthis dilemma. The editor wishes to thank an anonymous press reader foremphasizing the importance of this aspect of Malthus’s theological perspective.10 [09_Introduction.html#id_1624]. A. M. C.

The relationship of Malthus’s developingideas on population to religious orthodoxy and theodicy, from their firstexpression in 1798 to their suggested reformulation by 1803 as well as later,has been one of considerable debate in the literature on all the editions of theEssay. This debate reflects importantly on an understanding of the criticalreactions to Malthus’s Essay within both the Church of England and by Christianpolitical economists and reformers, which has been productively discussed bythese authors, as well as others, and is not developed further here.

Patricia James notes that at the close of theeighteenth century, the poor of England were “near starvation,” and theircondition in 1800 was to be exacerbated by another late harvest. In Yorkshire,robberies of storehouses and inns were increasing as one local observer noted:“That want must surely be dreadful, which would brave the gallows to obtain asingle meal.” James, Population Malthus, 86. Indeed, William Empson noted in his1837 Edinburgh Review memoir that as of 1796, Malthus’s position on populationwas at best at its “threshold,” and that “he had seen so little of his way” thatMalthus was at that point a “warm advocate of Mr. Pitt’s Poor Law bill and ofthe jus trium liberorum,” which in the tradition of the Roman Empire rewardedfamilies producing three or more children with state supplements. See Semmel,ed., Occasional Papers of T. R. Malthus, 244, 246. James Bonar quoted WilliamPitt’s 1796 speech in Parliament reprising the principle: “Let us make relief amatter of right and honor.

However, the specificterminology and the direct clarification of this preventative appears first inthe much more mature and comprehensive work of the Great Quarto. William Empson,in particular, emphasized the importance to Malthus of the introduction of moralrestraint in the 1803 edition, in that “he hoped that he had ‘not violated theprinciples of just reasoning, nor expressed any opinion respecting the probableimprovement of society, in which he was not borne out by the experience of thepast.’” (Ibid.) For Empson, its introduction in the second edition was arecognition that “as civilization practically descended into the mass of thepeople, the influence of moral restraint upon the course of the population mightbecome more and more perceptible.” Semmel, ed., Occasional Papers of T.

BENSLEY, BOLT COURT, FLEET STREET.1803."},{"pageContent":"PREFACE.THE Essay on the Principle of Population, which I published in 1798, wassuggested, as is expressed in the preface, by a paper in Mr. Godwin’s Inquirer.It was written on the spur of the occasion, and from the few materials whichwere within my reach in a country situation. The only authors from whosewritings I had deduced the principle, which formed the main argument of theessay, were Hume, Wallace, Dr. Adam Smith, and Dr. Price; and my object was toapply it to try the truth of those speculations on the perfectibility of man andsociety, which at that time excited a considerable portion of the publickattention.In the course of the discussion, I was naturally led into some examination ofthe effects of this principle on the existing state of society. It appeared toaccount for much of that poverty and misery observable among the lower classesof people in every nation, and for those reiterated failures in the efforts ofthe higher classes to relieve them. The more I considered the subject in thispoint of view, the more importance it seemed to acquire; and this consideration,joined to the degree of publick attention which the essay excited, determined meto turn my leisure reading towards an historical examination of the effects ofthe principle of population on the past and present state of society; that, byillustrating the subject more generally, and drawing those inferences from it,in application to the actual state of things which experience seemed to warrant,I might give it a more practical and permanent interest.In the course of this inquiry, I found that much more had been done, than I hadbeen aware of, when I first published the essay. The poverty and misery arisingfrom a too rapid increase of population, had been distinctly seen, and the mostviolent remedies proposed, so long ago as the times of Plato and Aristotle. Andof late years, the subject had been treated in such a manner, by some of theFrench Economists, occasionally by Montesquieu, and, among our own writers, byDr. Franklin, Sir James Steuart, Mr. Arthur Young, and Mr. Townsend, as tocreate a natural surprise, that it had not excited more of the publickattention.Much, however, remained yet to be done. Independently of the comparison betweenthe increase of population and food, which had not perhaps been stated withsufficient force and precision; some of the most curious and interesting partsof the subject had been either wholly omitted or treated very slightly. Thoughit had been stated distinctly, that population must always be kept down to thelevel of the means of subsistence; yet few inquiries had been made into thevarious modes by which this level is effected; and the principle had never beensufficiently pursued to its consequences, and those practical, inferences drawnfrom it, which a strict examination of its effects on society appears tosuggest.These are therefore the points which I have treated most in detail in thefollowing essay. In its present shape, it may be considered as a new work, and Ishould probably have published it as such, omitting the few parts of the formerwhich I have retained, but that I wished it to form a whole of itself, and notto need a continual reference to the other. On this account, I trust that noapology is necessary to the purchasers of the first edition. I should hope thatthere are some parts of it, not reprinted in this, which may still have theiruse; as they were rejected, not because I thought them all of less value thanwhat has been inserted, but because they did not suit the different plan oftreating the subject which I had adopted.To those who either understood the subject before, or saw it distinctly on theperusal of the first edition, I am fearful that I shall appear to have treatedsome parts of it too much in detail, and to have been guilty of unnecessaryrepetitions. These faults have arisen partly from want of skill, and partly fromintention. In drawing similar inferences from the state of society in a numberof different countries, I found it very difficult to avoid some repetitions; andin those parts of the inquiry which led to conclusions different from our usualhabits of thinking, it appeared to me, that, with the slightest hope ofproducing conviction, it was necessary to present them to the reader’s mind atdifferent times, and on different occasions. I was willing to sacrifice allpretensions to merit of composition, to the chance of making an impression on alarger class of readers.The main principle advanced is so incontrovertible, that, if I had confinedmyself merely to general views, I could have entrenched myself in an impregnablefortress; and the work, in this form, would probably have had a much moremasterly air. But such general views, though they may advance the cause ofabstract truth, rarely tend to promote any practical good; and I thought that Ishould not do justice to the subject, and bring it fairly under discussion, if Irefused to consider any of the consequences which appeared necessarily to flowfrom it, whatever these consequences might be. By pursuing this plan, however, Iam aware that I have opened a door to many objections; and, probably, to muchseverity of criticism: but I console myself with the reflection, that even theerrors into which I may have fallen, by affording a handle to argument, and anadditional excitement to examination, may be subservient to the important end,of bringing a subject so nearly connected with the happiness of society intomore general notice.Throughout the whole of the present work, I have so far differed in principlefrom the former, as to suppose another check to population possible, which doesnot strictly come under the head either of vice or misery; and, in the latterpart, I have endeavoured to soften some of the harshest conclusions of the firstessay. In doing this, I hope that I have not violated the principles of justreasoning; nor expressed any opinion respecting the probable improvement ofsociety, in which I am not borne out by the experience of the past. To those whoshall still think that any check to population whatever, would be worse than theevils which it would relieve, the conclusions of the former essay will remain infull force; and if we adopt this opinion, we shall be compelled to acknowledgethat the poverty and misery which prevail among the lower classes of society areabsolutely irremediable.I have taken as much pains as I could to avoid any errors in the facts andcalculations which have been produced in the course of the work. Should any ofthem nevertheless turn out to be false, the reader will see, that they will notmaterially affect the general tenour of the reasoning.From the crowd of materials which presented themselves in illustration of thefirst branch of the subject, I dare not flatter myself that I have selected thebest, or arranged them in the most perspicuous method. To those who take aninterest in moral and political questions, I hope that the novelty andimportance of the subject will compensate the imperfections of its execution.LONDON, June 8, 1803."},{"pageContent":"CONTENTS.BOOK I.

I.Statement of the Subject. Ratios of the Increase of Population and Food.IN an inquiry concerning the future improvement of society, the mode ofconducting the subject which naturally presents itself, is1. An investigation of the causes that have hitherto impeded the progress ofmankind towards happiness; and2. An examination into the probability of the total or partial removal of thesecauses in future.To enter fully into this question, and to enumerate all the causes that havehitherto influenced human improvement, would be much beyond the power of anindividual. The principal object of the present essay is to examine the effectsof one great cause intimately united with the very nature of man, which, thoughit has been constantly and powerfully operating since the commencement ofsociety, has been little noticed by the writers who have treated this subject.The facts which establish the existence of this cause have, indeed, beenrepeatedly stated and acknowledged; but its natural and necessary effects havebeen almost totally overlooked; though probably among these effects may bereckoned a very considerable portion of that vice and misery, and of thatunequal distribution of the bounties of nature, which it has been the unceasingobject of the enlightened philanthropist in all ages to correct.The cause to which I allude, is the constant tendency in all animated life toincrease beyond the nourishment prepared for it.It is observed by Dr. Franklin, that there is no bound to the prolific nature ofplants or animals, but what is made by their crowding and interfering with eachothers means of subsistence. Were the face of the earth, he says, vacant ofother plants, it might be gradually sowed and overspread with one kind only; as,for instance, with fennel: and were it empty of other inhabitants, it might in afew ages be replenished from one nation only; as, for instance, withEnglishmen.1 [15_CHAP__I__Statement_of_the_subjec.html#id_3]This is incontrovertibly true. Through the animal and vegetable kingdoms Naturehas scattered the seeds of life abroad with the most profuse and liberal hand;but has been comparatively sparing in the room and the nourishment necessary torear them. The germs of existence contained in this spot of earth, with amplefood, and ample room to expand in, would fill millions of worlds in the courseof a few thousand years. Necessity, that imperious all-pervading law of nature,restrains them within the prescribed bounds. The race of plants and the race ofanimals shrink under this great restrictive law; and the race of man cannot byany efforts of reason escape from it.In plants and animals the view of the subject is simple. They are all impelledby a powerful instinct to the increase of their species; and this instinct isinterrupted by no reasoning or doubts about providing for their offspring.Wherever, therefore, there is liberty, the power of increase is exerted; and thesuperabundant effects are repressed afterwards by want of room and nourishment,which is common to plants and animals; and among animals, by their becoming theprey of each other.The effects of this check on man are more complicated. Impelled to the increaseof his species by an equally powerful instinct, reason interrupts his career,and asks him whether he may not bring beings into the world, for whom he cannotprovide the means of support. If he attend to this natural suggestion, therestriction too frequently produces vice. If he hear it not, the human race willbe constantly endeavouring to increase beyond the means of subsistence. But asby that law of our nature which makes food necessary to the life of man,population can never actually increase beyond the lowest nourishment capable ofsupporting it; a strong check on population, from the difficulty of acquiringfood, must be constantly in operation. This difficulty must fall somewhere; andmust necessarily be severely felt in some or other of the various forms ofmisery, or the fear of misery, by a large portion of mankind.That population has this constant tendency to increase beyond the means ofsubsistence, and that it is kept to its necessary level by these causes, willsufficiently appear from a review of the different states of society in whichman has existed. But before we proceed to this review, the subject will perhapsbe seen in a clearer light, if we endeavour to ascertain, what would be thenatural increase of population if left to exert itself with perfect freedom; andwhat might be expected to be the rate of increase in the productions of theearth, under the most favourable circumstances of human industry. A comparisonof these two rates of increase will enable us to judge of the force of thattendency in population to increase beyond the means of subsistence, which hasbeen stated to exist.It will be allowed, that no country has hitherto been known, where the mannerswere so pure and simple, and the means of subsistence so abundant, that no checkwhatever has existed to early marriages from the difficulty of providing for afamily; and no waste of the human species has been occasioned afterwards byvicious customs, by towns, by unhealthy occupations, or too severe labour.Consequently in no state that we have yet known, has the power of populationbeen left to exert itself with perfect freedom.Whether the law of marriage be instituted, or not, the dictate of nature andvirtue seems to be an early attachment to one woman; and where there were noimpediments of any kind in the way of an union to which such an attachment wouldlead, and no causes of depopulation afterwards, the increase of the humanspecies would be evidently much greater than any increase which has beenhitherto known.In the northern states of America, where the means of subsistence have been moreample, the manners of the people more pure, and the checks to early marriagesfewer, than in any of the modern states of Europe, the population was found todouble itself for some successive periods every twenty-five years. Yet evenduring these periods, in some of the towns, the deaths exceeded the births;2[15_CHAP__I__Statement_of_the_subjec.html#id_5] and they consequently required acontinued supply from the country to support their population.In the back settlements, where the sole employment was agriculture, and viciouscustoms and unwholesome occupations were unknown, the population was found todouble itself in fifteen years.3 [15_CHAP__I__Statement_of_the_subjec.html#id_9]Even this extraordinary rate of increase is probably short of the utmost powerof population. Very severe labour is requisite to clear a fresh country; suchsituations are not in general considered as particularly healthy; and theinhabitants were probably occasionally subject to the incursions of the Indians,which might destroy some lives, or at any rate diminish the fruits of theirindustry.According to a table of Euler, calculated on a mortality of 1 in 36, if thebirths be to the deaths in the proportion of 3 to 1, the period of doubling willbe only 12-4/5 years.4 [15_CHAP__I__Statement_of_the_subjec.html#id_1645] Andthese proportions are not only possible suppositions, but have actually occurredfor short periods in more countries than one.Sir William Petty supposes a doubling possible in so short a time as ten years.5[15_CHAP__I__Statement_of_the_subjec.html#id_7]But to be perfectly sure that we are far within the truth, we will take theslowest of these rates of increase; a rate, in which all concurring testimoniesagree, and which has been repeatedly ascertained to be from procreation only.It may safely be pronounced therefore, that population when unchecked goes ondoubling itself every twenty-five years, or increases in a geometrical ratio.The rate according to which the productions of the earth may be supposed toincrease, it will not be so easy to determine. Of this, however, we may beperfectly certain, that the ratio of their increase must be totally of adifferent nature from the ratio of the increase of population. A thousandmillions are just as easily doubled every twenty-five years by the power ofpopulation as a thousand. But the food to support the increase from the greaternumber will by no means be obtained with the same facility. Man is necessarilyconfined in room. When acre has been added to acre till all the fertile land isoccupied, the yearly increase of food must depend upon the amelioration of theland already in possession. This is a stream, which, from the nature of allsoils, instead of increasing, must be gradually diminishing. But population,could it be supplied with food, would go on with unexhausted vigour; and theincrease of one period would furnish the power of a greater increase the next,and this, without any limit.From the accounts we have of China and Japan, it may be fairly doubted, whetherthe best directed efforts of human industry could double the produce of thesecountries even once in any number of years. There are many parts of the globe,indeed, hitherto uncultivated, and almost unoccupied; but the right ofexterminating, or driving into a corner where they must starve, even theinhabitants of these thinly peopled regions, will be questioned in a moral view.The process of improving their minds and directing their industry, wouldnecessarily be slow; and during this time, as population would regularly keeppace with the increasing produce, it would rarely happen that a great degree ofknowledge and industry would have to operate at once upon rich unappropriatedsoil. Even where this might take place, as it does sometimes in new colonies, ageometrical ratio increases with such extraordinary rapidity, that the advantagecould not last long. If America continue increasing, which she certainly willdo, though not with the same rapidity as formerly, the Indians will be drivenfurther and further back into the country, till the whole race is ultimatelyexterminated.These observations are, in a degree, applicable to all the parts of the earth,where the soil is imperfectly cultivated. To exterminate the inhabitants of thegreatest part of Asia and Africa, is a thought that could not be admitted for amoment. To civilize and direct the industry of the various tribes of Tartars,and Negroes, would certainly be a work of considerable time, and of variable anduncertain success.Europe is by no means so fully peopled as it might be. In Europe, there is thefairest chance that human industry may receive its best direction. The scienceof agriculture has been much studied in England and Scotland; and there is stilla great portion of uncultivated land in these countries. Let us consider, atwhat rate the produce of this island might be supposed to increase undercircumstances the most favourable to improvement.If it be allowed, that by the best possible policy, and great encouragements toagriculture, the average produce of the island could be doubled in the firsttwenty-five years, it will be allowing probably a greater increase than couldwith reason be expected.In the next twenty-five years, it is impossible to suppose that the producecould be quadrupled. It would be contrary to all our knowledge of the propertiesof land. The improvement of the barren parts would be a work of time and labour;and it must be evident to those who have the slightest acquaintance withagricultural subjects, that in proportion as cultivation extended, the additionsthat could yearly be made to the former average produce, must be gradually andregularly diminishing. That we may be the better able to compare the increase ofpopulation and food, let us make a supposition, which, without pretending toaccuracy, is clearly more favourable to the power of production in the earth,than any experience that we have had of its qualities will warrant.Let us suppose that the yearly additions which might be made to the formeraverage produce, instead of decreasing, which they certainly would do, were toremain the same; and that the produce of this island might be increased everytwenty-five years, by a quantity equal to what it at present produces: the mostenthusiastic speculator cannot suppose a greater increase than this. In a fewcenturies it would make every acre of land in the island like a garden.If this supposition be applied to the whole earth, and if it be allowed that thesubsistence for man which the earth affords, might be increased everytwenty-five years by a quantity equal to what it at present produces, this willbe supposing a rate of increase much greater than we can imagine that anypossible exertions of mankind could make it.It may be fairly pronounced therefore, that, considering the present averagestate of the earth, the means of subsistence, under circumstances the mostfavourable to human industry, could not possibly be made to increase faster thanin an arithmetical ratio.The necessary effects of these two different rates of increase, when broughttogether, will be very striking. Let us call the population of this islandeleven millions; and suppose the present produce equal to the easy support ofsuch a number. In the first twenty-five years the population would be twenty-twomillions, and the food being also doubled, the means of subsistence would beequal to this increase. In the next twenty-five years, the population would beforty-four millions, and the means of subsistence only equal to the support ofthirty-three millions. In the next period the population would be eighty-eightmillions, and the means of subsistence just equal to the support of half of thatnumber. And at the conclusion of the first century, the population would be ahundred and seventy-six millions, and the means of subsistence only equal to thesupport of fifty-five millions; leaving a population of a hundred and twenty-onemillions totally unprovided for.Taking the whole earth instead of this island, emigration would of course beexcluded; and supposing the present population equal to a thousand millions, thehuman species would increase as the numbers 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256,and subsistence as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. In two centuries the populationwould be to the means of subsistence as 256 to 9; in three centuries as 4096 to13, and in two thousand years the difference would be almost incalculable.In this supposition no limits whatever are placed to the produce of the earth.It may increase for ever, and be greater than any assignable quantity; yet stillthe power of population being in every period so much superior, the increase ofthe human species can only be kept down to the level of the means of subsistenceby the constant operation of the strong law of necessity acting as a check uponthe greater power.NOTES1 [15_CHAP__I__Statement_of_the_subjec.html#id_2].

II.Of the general Checks to Population, and the Mode of their Operation.THE checks to population, which are constantly operating with more or less forcein every society, and keep down the number to the level of the means ofsubsistence, may be classed under two general heads; the preventive and thepositive checks.The preventive check, is peculiar to man, and arises from that distinctivesuperiority in his reasoning faculties, which enables him to calculate distantconsequences. Plants and animals have apparently no doubts about the futuresupport of their offspring. The checks to their indefinite increase, therefore,are all positive. But man cannot look around him, and see the distress whichfrequently presses upon those who have large families; he cannot contemplate hispresent possessions or earnings, which he now nearly consumes himself, andcalculate the amount of each share, when with very little addition they must bedivided, perhaps, among seven or eight, without feeling a doubt, whether if hefollow the bent of his inclinations, he may be able to support the offspringwhich he will probably bring into the world. In a state of equality, if such canexist, this would be the simple question. In the present state of society otherconsiderations occur. Will he not lower his rank in life, and be obliged to giveup in great measure his former society? Does any mode of employment presentitself by which he may reasonably hope to maintain a family? Will he not at anyrate subject himself to greater difficulties, and more severe labour than in hissingle state? Will he not be unable to transmit to his children the sameadvantages of education and improvement that he had himself possessed? Does heeven feel secure that, should he have a large family, his utmost exertions cansave them from rags, and squalid poverty, and their consequent degradation inthe community? And may he not be reduced to the grating necessity of forfeitinghis independence, and of being obliged to the sparing hand of charity forsupport?These considerations are calculated to prevent, and certainly do prevent, agreat number of persons in all civilized nations from pursuing the dictate ofnature in an early attachment to one woman.If this restraint do not produce vice, as in many instances is the case, andvery generally so among the middle and higher classes of women, it isundoubtedly the least evil that can arise from the principle of population.Considered as a restraint on an inclination, otherwise innocent, and alwaysnatural, it must be allowed to produce a certain degree of temporaryunhappiness; but evidently slight, compared with the evils which result from anyof the other checks to population.When this restraint produces vice, as it does most frequently among men, andamong a numerous class of females, the evils which follow are but tooconspicuous. A promiscuous intercourse to such a degree as to prevent the birthof children, seems to lower in the most marked manner the dignity of humannature. It cannot be without its effect on men, and nothing can be more obviousthan its tendency to degrade the female character, and to destroy all its mostamiable and distinguishing characteristics. Add to which, that among thoseunfortunate females with which all great towns abound, more real distress andaggravated misery are perhaps to be found, than in any other department of humanlife.When a general corruption of morals, with regard to the sex, pervades all theclasses of society, its effects must necessarily be, to poison the springs ofdomestic happiness, to weaken conjugal and parental affection, and to lessen theunited exertions and ardour of parents in the care and education of theirchildren; effects, which cannot take place without a decided diminution of thegeneral happiness and virtue of the society; particularly, as the necessity ofart in the accomplishment and conduct of intrigues, and in the concealment oftheir consequences, necessarily leads to many other vices.The positive checks to population are extremely various, and include everycause, whether arising from vice or misery, which in any degree contributes toshorten the natural duration of human life. Under this head therefore may beenumerated, all unwholesome occupations, severe labour and exposure to theseasons, extreme poverty, bad nursing of children, great towns, excesses of allkinds, the whole train of common diseases and epidemics, wars, pestilence,plague, and famine.On examining these obstacles to the increase of population which I have classedunder the heads of preventive, and positive checks, it will appear that they areall resolvable into moral restraint, vice, and misery.Of the preventive checks, that which is not followed by irregulargratifications, may properly be termed moral restraint.Promiscuous intercourse, unnatural passions, violations of the marriage bed, andimproper arts to conceal the consequences of irregular connexions, clearly comeunder the head of vice.Of the positive checks, those which appear to arise unavoidably from the laws ofnature may be called exclusively misery; and those which we obviously bring uponourselves, such as wars, excesses, and many others which it would be in ourpower to avoid, are of a mixed nature. They are brought upon us by vice, andtheir consequences are misery.1 [16_II__Of_the_general_checks_to_pop.html#id_11]In every country, some of these checks are, with more or less force, in constantoperation; yet notwithstanding their general prevalence, there are few states inwhich there is not a constant effort in the population to increase beyond themeans of subsistence. This constant effort as constantly tends to subject thelower classes of society to distress, and to prevent any great permanentamelioration of their condition.These effects, in the present state of society, seem to be produced in thefollowing manner. We will suppose the means of subsistence in any country justequal to the easy support of its inhabitants. The constant effort towardspopulation, which is found to act even in the most vicious societies, increasesthe number of people before the means of subsistence are increased. The foodtherefore which before supported eleven millions, must now be divided amongeleven millions and a half. The poor consequently must live much worse, and manyof them be reduced to severe distress. The number of labourers also being abovethe proportion of work in the market, the price of labour must tend to fall;while the price of provisions would at the same time tend to rise. The labourertherefore must do more work, to earn the same as he did before. During thisseason of distress, the discouragements to marriage, and the difficulty ofrearing a family are so great, that population is nearly at a stand. In the meantime, the cheapness of labour, the plenty of labourers, and the necessity of anincreased industry among them, encourage cultivators to employ more labour upontheir land; to turn up fresh soil, and to manure and improve more completelywhat is already in tillage; till ultimately the means of subsistence may becomein the same proportion to the population, as at the period from which we setout. The situation of the labourer being then again tolerably comfortable, therestraints to population are in some degree loosened; and, after a short period,the same retrograde and progressive movements, with respect to happiness, arerepeated.This sort of oscillation will not probably be obvious to common view; and it maybe difficult even for the most attentive observer to calculate its periods. Yetthat, in the generality of old states, some such vibration does exist, though ina much less marked, and in a much more irregular manner, than I have describedit, no reflecting man who considers the subject deeply can well doubt.One principal reason why this oscillation has been less remarked, and lessdecidedly confirmed by experience than might naturally be expected, is, that thehistories of mankind which we possess, are, in general, histories only of thehigher classes. We have not many accounts, that can be depended upon, of themanners and customs of that part of mankind where these retrograde andprogressive movements chiefly take place. A satisfactory history of this kind,of one people and of one period, would require the constant and minute attentionof many observing minds in local and general remarks on the state of the lowerclasses of society, and the causes that influenced it; and to draw accurateinferences upon this subject, a succession of such historians for some centurieswould be necessary. This branch of statistical knowledge has of late years beenattended to in some countries,2 [16_II__Of_the_general_checks_to_pop.html#id_13]and we may promise ourselves a clearer insight into the internal structure ofhuman society from the progress of these inquiries. But the science may be saidyet to be in its infancy, and many of the objects, on which it would bedesirable to have information, have been either omitted or not stated withsufficient accuracy. Among these perhaps may be reckoned, the proportion of thenumber of adults to the number of marriages; the extent to which vicious customshave prevailed in consequence of the restraints upon matrimony; the comparativemortality among the children of the most distressed part of the community, andof those who live rather more at their ease; the variations in the real price oflabour; the observable differences in the state of the lower classes of societywith respect to ease and happiness, at different times during a certain period;and very accurate registers of births, deaths, and marriages, which are of theutmost importance in this subject.A faithful history, including such particulars, would tend greatly to elucidatethe manner in which the constant check upon population acts; and would probablyprove the existence of the retrograde and progressive movements that have beenmentioned; though the times of their vibration must necessarily be renderedirregular from the operation of many interrupting causes; such as, theintroduction of or failure of certain manufactures, a greater or less prevalentspirit of agricultural enterprize; years of plenty, or years of scarcity; wars,sickly seasons, poor laws, emigration, and other causes of a similar nature.A circumstance which has perhaps more than any other contributed to conceal thisoscillation from common view, is, the difference between the nominal and realprice of labour. It very rarely happens that the nominal price of labouruniversally falls; but we well know that it frequently remains the same, whilethe nominal price of provisions has been gradually rising. This is, in effect, areal fall in the price of labour; and, during this period, the condition of thelower classes of the community must be gradually growing worse. But the farmersand capitalists are growing rich from the real cheapness of labour. Theirincreasing capitals enable them to employ a greater number of men; and, as thepopulation had probably suffered some check from the greater difficulty ofsupporting a family, the demand for labour, after a certain period, would begreat in proportion to the supply, and its price would of course rise, if leftto find its natural level; and thus the wages of labour, and consequently thecondition of the lower classes of society, might have progressive and retrogrademovements, though the price of labour might never nominally fall.In savage life, where there is no regular price of labour, it is little to bedoubted that similar oscillations take place. When population has increasednearly to the utmost limits of the food, all the preventive and the positivechecks will naturally operate with increased force. Vicious habits with respectto the sex will be more general, the exposing of children more frequent, andboth the probability, and fatality, of wars and epidemicks, will be considerablygreater; and these causes will probably continue their operation till thepopulation is sunk below the level of the food; and then the return tocomparative plenty will again produce an increase, and, after a certain period,its further progress will again be checked by the same causes.3[16_II__Of_the_general_checks_to_pop.html#id_15]But without attempting to establish in all cases these progressive andretrograde movements in different countries, which would evidently require moreminute histories than we possess, the following propositions are proposed to beproved:1. Population is necessarily limited by the means of subsistence.2. Population invaribly increases, where the means of subsistence increase,unless prevented by some very powerful and obvious checks.3. These checks, and the checks which repress the superior power of population,and keep its effects on a level with the means of subsistence, are allresolvable into moral restraint, vice, and misery.The first of these propositions scarcely needs illustration. The second andthird will be sufficiently established by a review of the past and present stateof society.This review will be the subject of the following chapters.NOTES1 [16_II__Of_the_general_checks_to_pop.html#id_10]. As the general consequenceof vice is misery, and as this consequence is the precise reason why an actionis termed vicious, it may appear that the term misery alone would be heresufficient, and that it is superfluous to use both. But the rejection of theterm vice would introduce a considerable confusion into our language and ideas.We want it particularly to distinguish that class of actions, the generaltendency of which is to produce misery, but which, in their immediate orindividual effects, may produce perhaps exactly the contrary. The gratificationof all our passions in its immediate effect is happiness, not misery; and inindividual instances even the remote consequences (at least in this life) comeunder the same denomination. I have little doubt that there have been someirregular connexions with women, which have added to the happiness of bothparties, and have injured no one. These individual actions therefore cannot comeunder the head of misery. But they are still evidently vicious, because anaction is so denominated, the general tendency of which is to produce misery,whatever may be its individual effect; and no person can doubt the generaltendency of an illicit intercourse between the sexes, to injure the happiness ofsociety.2 [16_II__Of_the_general_checks_to_pop.html#id_12]. The judicious questionswhich Sir John Sinclair circulated in Scotland, and the very valuable accountswhich he has collected in that part of the island, do him the highest honour;and these accounts will ever remain an extraordinary monument of the learning,good sense, and general information of the clergy of Scotland. It is to beregretted that the adjoining parishes are not put together in the work, whichwould have assisted the memory both in attaining and recollecting the state ofparticular districts. The repetitions and contradictory opinions which occur arenot in my opinion so objectionable, as, to the result of such testimony, morefaith may be given than we could possibly give to the testimony of anyindividual. Even were this result drawn for us by some master hand, though muchvaluable time would undoubtedly be saved, the information would not be sosatisfactory. If, with a few subordinate improvements, this work had containedaccurate and complete registers for the last 150 years, it would have beeninestimable, and would have exhibited a better picture of the internal state ofa country, than has yet been presented to the world. But this last mostessential improvement no diligence could have effected.3 [16_II__Of_the_general_checks_to_pop.html#id_14]. Sir James Steuart veryjustly compares the generative faculty to a spring loaded with a variableweight, (Polit. Econ. vol. i. b. i. c. 4. p. 20.) which would of course produceexactly that kind of oscillation which has been mentioned. In the first book ofhis Political Economy, he has explained many parts of the subject of populationvery ably."},{"pageContent":"CHAP. III.Of the Checks to Population in the lowest Stage of Human Society.THE wretched inhabitants of Terra del Fuego have been placed by the generalconsent of voyagers at the bottom of the scale of human beings.1[17_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_21] Of their domestic habits andmanners, however, we have few accounts. Their barren country, and the miserablestate in which they live, have prevented any intercourse with them that mightgive such information; but we cannot be at a loss to conceive the checks topopulation among a race of savages, whose very appearance indicates them to behalf starved, and who, shivering with cold, and covered with filth and vermin,live in one of the most inhospitable climates in the world, without havingsagacity enough to provide themselves with such conveniences as might mitigateits severities, and render life in some measure more comfortable.2[17_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1647]Next to these, and almost as low in genius and resources, have been placed, thenatives of Van Diemen’s land;3 [17_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_19]but some late accounts have represented the islands of Andaman in the east, asinhabited by a race of savages still lower in wretchedness even than these.Every thing that voyagers have related of savage life, is said to fall short ofthe barbarism of this people. Their whole time is spent in search of food; andas their woods yield them few or no supplies of animals, and but littlevegetable diet, their principal occupation is that of climbing the rocks, orroving along the margin of the sea, in search of a precarious meal of fish,which, during the tempestuous season, they often seek for in vain. Their statureseldom exceeds five feet; their bellies are protuberant, with high shoulders,large heads, and limbs disproportionably slender. Their countenances exhibit theextreme of wretchedness, a horrid mixture of famine and ferocity; and theirextenuated and diseased figures plainly indicate the want of wholesomenourishment. Some of these unhappy beings have been found on the shores in thelast stage of famine.4 [17_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_17]In the next scale of human beings perhaps we may place the inhabitants of NewHolland, of a part of whom we have some accounts that may be depended upon, froma person who resided a considerable time at Port Jackson, and had frequentopportunities of being a witness to their habits and manners. The narrator ofCaptain Cook’s first voyage having mentioned the very small number ofinhabitants that was seen on the eastern coast of New Holland, and the apparentinability of the country, from its desolate state, to support many more,observes, “By what means the inhabitants of this country are reduced to such anumber as it can subsist, is not perhaps very easy to guess; whether, like theinhabitants of New Zealand, they are destroyed by the hands of each other incontests for food, whether they are swept off by accidental famine, or whetherthere is any cause that prevents the increase of the species, must be left forfuture adventurers to determine.”5[17_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_27]The account which Mr. Collins has given of these savages will, I hope, afford insome degree a satisfactory answer. They are described as, in general, neithertall nor well made. Their arms, legs, and thighs, are thin, which is ascribed tothe poorness of their mode of living. Those who inhabit the sea-coast dependalmost entirely on fish for their sustenance, relieved occasionally by a repaston some large grubs which are found in the body of the dwarf gum tree. The veryscanty stock of animals in the woods, and the very great labour necessary totake them, keep the inland natives in as poor a condition as their brethren onthe coast. They are compelled to climb the tallest trees after honey, and thesmaller animals, such as the flying squirrel and the opossum. When the stems areof great height, and without branches, which is generally the case, in thickforests, this is a process of great labour, and is effected by cutting a notchwith their stone hatchets for each foot successively, while their left armembraces the tree. Trees were observed notched in this manner to the height ofeighty feet before the first branch, where the hungry savage could hope to meetwith any reward for so much toil.6[17_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_25]The woods, exclusive of the animals occasionally found in them, afford butlittle sustenance. A few berries, the yam, the fern root, and the flowers of thedifferent banksia, make up the whole of the vegetable catalogue.7[17_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_23]A native with his child, surprised on the banks of the Hawksbury river by someof our colonists, launched his canoe in a hurry, and left behind him a specimenof his food, and of the delicacy of his stomach. From a piece of water-sokenwood, full of holes, he had been extracting and eating a large worm. The smellboth of the worm and its habitation was in the highest degree offensive. Theseworms, in the language of the country, are called cah-bro; and a tribe ofnatives dwelling inland, from the circumstance of eating these loathsome worms,is named Cah-brogal. The wood natives also make a paste formed of the fern root,and the large and small ants bruised together, and, in the season, add the eggsof this insect.8 [17_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_31]In a country, the inhabitants of which are driven to such resources forsubsistence, where the supply of animal and vegetable food is so extremelyscanty, and the labour necessary to procure it is so severe, it is evident, thatthe population must be very thinly scattered in proportion to the territory. Itsutmost bounds must be very narrow. But when we advert to the strange andbarbarous customs of these people, the cruel treatment of their women, and thedifficulty of rearing children; instead of being surprised that it does not morefrequently press to pass these bounds, we shall be rather inclined to considereven these scanty resources as more than sufficient to support all thepopulation that could grow up under such circumstances.The prelude to love in this country is violence, and of the most brutal nature.The savage selects his intended wife from the women of a different tribe,generally one at enmity with his own. He steals upon her in the absence of herprotectors, and having first stupified her with blows of a club, or woodensword, on the head, back, and shoulders, every one of which is followed by astream of blood, he drags her through the woods by one arm, regardless of thestones and broken pieces of trees that may lie in his route, and anxious only toconvey his prize in safety to his own party, where a most brutal scene ensues.The woman thus ravished becomes his wife, and is incorporated into the tribe towhich he belongs, and but seldom quits him for another. The outrage is notresented by the relations of the female, who only retaliate by a similar outragewhen it is in their power.9 [17_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1649]The union of the sexes takes place at an early age, and instances were known toour colonists of very young girls having been much and shamefully abused by themales.10 [17_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_29]The conduct of the husband to his wife, or wives, seems to be nearly incharacter with this strange and barbarous mode of courtship. The females bear ontheir heads the traces of the superiority of the males, which is exercisedalmost as soon as they find strength in their arms to inflict a blow. Some ofthese unfortunate beings have been observed with more scars on their shorn headscut in every direction, than could well be counted. Mr. Collins feelingly says,“The condition of these women is so wretched, that I have often, on seeing afemale child borne on its mothers shoulders, anticipated the miseries to whichit was born, and thought it would be a mercy to destroy it.”11[17_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_35] In another place, speaking ofBennilong’s wife being delivered of a child, he says, “I here find in my papersa note “that for some offence Bennilong had severely beaten this woman in the“morning, a short time before she was delivered.”12[17_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1651]Women treated in this brutal manner must necessarily be subject to frequentmiscarriages, and it is probable that the abuse of very young girls, mentionedabove as common, and the too early union of the sexes in general, would tend toprevent the females from being prolifick. Instances of a plurality of wives werefound more frequent than of a single wife; but what is extraordinary, Mr.Collins did not recollect ever to have noticed children by more than one. He hadheard from some of the natives, that the first wife claimed an exclusive rightto the conjugal embrace, while the second was merely the slave and drudge ofboth.13 [17_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_33]An absolutely exclusive right in the first wife to the conjugal embrace seems tobe hardly probable; but it is possible that the second wife might not be allowedto rear her offspring. At any rate, if the observation be generally true, itproves that a great part of the women are without children, which can only beaccounted for from the very severe hardships which they undergo, or from someparticular customs which may not have come to the knowledge of Mr. Collins.If the mother of a sucking child die, the helpless infant is buried alive in thesame grave with its mother. The father himself places his living child on thebody of his dead wife, and having thrown a large stone upon it, the grave isinstantly filled by the other natives. This dreadful act was performed byCo-le-be, a native well known to our colonists, and who, on being talked to onthe subject, justified the proceeding by declaring that no woman could be foundwho would undertake to nurse the child, and that therefore it must have died amuch worse death than that which he had given it. Mr. Collins had reason tobelieve that this custom was generally prevalent, and observes, that it may insome measure account for the thinness of the population.14[17_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1653]Such a custom, though in itself perhaps it might not much affect the populationof a country, places in a strong point of view the difficulty of rearingchildren in savage life. Women, obliged by their habits of living to a constantchange of place, and compelled to an unremitting drudgery for their husbands,appear to be absolutely incapable of bringing up two or three children nearly ofthe same age. If another child be born before the one above it can shift foritself, and follow its mother on foot, one of the two must almost necessarilyperish for want of care. The task of rearing even one infant, in such awandering and laborious life, must be so troublesome and painful, that we arenot to be surprised that no woman can be found to undertake it, who is notprompted by the powerful feelings of a mother.To these causes, which forcibly repress the rising generation, must be addedthose which contribute subsequently to destroy it; such as the frequent wars ofthese savages with different tribes, and their perpetual contests with eachother; their strange spirit of retaliation and revenge which prompts themidnight murder, and the frequent shedding of innocent blood; the smoke andfilth of their miserable habitations, and their poor mode of living, productiveof loathsome cutaneous disorders, and above all, a dreadful epidemic like thesmall-pox, which sweeps off great numbers.15[17_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_41]In the year 1789 they were visited by this epidemic which raged among them withall the appearance and virulence of the small-pox. The desolation that itoccasioned was almost incredible. Not a living person was to be found in thebays and harbours that were before the most frequented. Not a vestige of a humanfoot was to be traced on the sands. They had left the dead to bury the dead. Theexcavations in the rocks were filled with putrid bodies, and in many places thepaths were covered with skeletons.16[17_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_39]Mr. Collins was informed, that the tribe of Co-le-be, the native mentionedbefore, had been reduced by the effects of this dreadful disorder to threepersons; who found themselves obliged to unite with some other tribe to preventtheir utter extinction.17 [17_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1655]Under such powerful causes of depopulation, we should naturally be inclined tosuppose that the animal and vegetable produce of the country would be increasingupon the thinly scattered inhabitants, and, added to the supply of fish fromtheir shores, would be more than sufficient for their consumption; yet, itappears upon the whole, that the population is in general so nearly on a levelwith the average supply of food, that every little deficiency from unfavourableweather, or other causes, occasions distress. Particular times, when theinhabitants seemed to be in great want, are mentioned as not uncommon, and atthese periods, some of the natives were found reduced to skeletons, and almoststarved to death.18 [17_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_37]NOTES1 [17_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_20].

IV.Of the Checks to Population among the American Indians.WE may next turn our view to the vast continent of America, the greatest part ofwhich was found to be inhabited by small independent tribes of savages,subsisting nearly in a similar manner to the natives of New Holland on theproductions of unassisted nature. The soil was covered by an almost universalforest, and presented few of those fruits and esculent vegetables which grow insuch profusion in the islands of the South Sea. The produce of a most rude andimperfect agriculture, known to some of the tribes of hunters, was so triflingas to be considered only as a feeble aid to the subsistence acquired by thechace. The inhabitants of this new world, therefore, might be considered asliving principally by hunting and fishing;1[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_43] and the narrow limits to thismode of subsistence are obvious. The supplies derived from fishing could extendonly to those who were within a certain distance of the lakes, the rivers, orthe sea-shore; and the ignorance and indolence of the improvident savage wouldfrequently prevent him from extending the benefits of these supplies much beyondthe time when they were actually obtained. The great extent of territoryrequired for the support of the hunter has been repeatedly stated andacknowledged.2 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1657] The number ofwild animals within his reach, combined with the facility with which they mightbe either killed or ensnared, must necessarily limit the number of his society.Tribes of hunters, like beasts of prey, whom they resemble in their mode ofsubsistence, will consequently be thinly scattered over the surface of theearth. Like beasts of prey, they must either drive away, or fly from, everyrival, and be engaged in perpetual contests with each other.3[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1659]Under such circumstances, that America should be very thinly peopled inproportion to its extent of territory, is merely an exemplification of theobvious truth, that population cannot increase without the food to support it.But the interesting part of the inquiry, that part, to which I would wishparticularly to draw the attention of the reader, is, the mode by which thepopulation is kept down to the level of this scanty supply. It cannot escapeobservation, that an insufficient supply of food to any people, does not shewitself merely in the shape of famine, but in other more permanent forms ofdistress, and in generating certain customs, which operate sometimes withgreater force in the suppression of a rising population, than in its subsequentdestruction.It was generally remarked, that the American women were far from being prolific,their marriages seldom producing above two or three children.4[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_51] This unfruitfulness has beenattributed by some to a want of ardour in the men towards their women; a featureof character, which has been considered as peculiar to the American savage. Itis not however peculiar to this race; but probably exists in a great degreeamong all barbarous nations, whose food is poor and insufficient, and who livein a constant apprehension of being pressed by famine, or by an enemy. Brucefrequently takes notice of it, particularly, in reference to the Galla andShangalla, savage nations on the borders of Abyssinia;5[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_49] and Le Vaillant mentions thephlegmatic temperament of the Hottentots as the chief reason of their thinpopulation.6 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_47] It seems to begenerated by the hardships and dangers of savage life, which take off theattention from the sexual passion. And that these are the principal causes of itamong the Americans, rather than any absolute constitutional defect, appearsprobable, from its diminishing, nearly in proportion to the degree in whichthese causes are mitigated, or removed. In those countries of America, where,from peculiar situation or further advantages in improvement, the hardships ofsavage life are less severely felt, the passion between the sexes becomes moreardent. Among some of the tribes seated on the banks of rivers well stored withfish, or others that inhabit a territory greatly abounding in game or muchimproved in agriculture, the women are more valued and admired; and as hardlyany restraint is imposed on the gratification of desire, the dissolution oftheir manners is sometimes excessive.7[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_45]If we do not then consider this apathy of the Americans as a natural defect inthe bodily frame, but merely as a general coldness, and an infrequency of thecalls of the sexual appetite, we shall not be inclined to give much weight to itas affecting the number of children to a marriage; but shall be disposed to lookfor the cause of this unfruitfulness in the condition and customs of the womenin a savage state. And here we shall find reasons amply sufficient to accountfor the fact in question.It is finely observed by Dr. Robertson, that “Whether man has been improved bythe progress of arts and civilization, is a question, which in the wantonness ofdisputation has been agitated among philosophers. That women are indebted to therefinement of polished manners for a happy change in their state, is a point,which can admit of no doubt.” 8 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_65]In every part of the world, one of the most general characteristics of thesavage is to despise and degrade the female sex.9[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_63] Among most of the tribes inAmerica their condition is so peculiarly grievous, that servitude is a name toomild to describe their wretched state. A wife is no better than a beast ofburthen. While the man passes his days in idleness or amusement, the woman iscondemned to incessant toil. Tasks are imposed upon her without mercy, andservices are received without complacence or gratitude.10[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_61] There are some districts inAmerica where this state of degradation has been so severely felt, that mothershave destroyed their female infants, to deliver them at once from a life inwhich they were doomed to such a miserable slavery.11[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_59]This state of depression and constant labour added to the unavoidable hardshipsof savage life must be very unfavourable to the office of childbearing;12[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_57] and the libertinage whichgenerally prevails among the women before marriage, with the habit of procuringabortions, in which they rarely fail, must necessarily render them more unfitfor bearing children afterwards.13[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_55] One of the missionaries speakingof the common practice among the Natchez of changing their wives, adds, unlessthey have children by them, a proof, that these marriages were in generalunfruitful, which may be accounted for from the libertine lives of the womenbefore wedlock, which he had previously noticed.14[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_53]The causes, that Charlevoix assigns, of the sterility of the American women,are, the suckling their children for several years, during which time they donot cohabit with their husbands; the excessive labour to which they are alwayscondemned in whatever situation they may be; and the custom established in manyplaces of permitting the young women to prostitute themselves before marriage.Added to this, he says, the extreme misery to which these people are sometimesreduced, takes from them all desire of having children.15[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_77] Among some of the ruder tribesit is a maxim not to burden themselves with rearing more than two of theiroffspring.16 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_75] When twins areborn, one of them is commonly abandoned, as the mother cannot rear them both;and when a mother dies during the period of suckling her child, no chance ofpreserving its life remains, and, as in New Holland, it is buried in the samegrave with the breast that nourished it.17[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_73]As the parents are frequently exposed to want themselves, the difficulty ofsupporting their children becomes at times so great, that they are reduced tothe necessity of abandoning or destroying them.18[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_71] Deformed children are verygenerally exposed; and among some of the tribes in South America, the childrenof mothers who do not bear their labours well, experience a similar fate, from afear that the offspring may inherit the weakness of its parent.19[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1661]To causes of this nature we must ascribe the remarkable exemption of theAmericans from deformities of make. Even when a mother endeavours to rear allher children without distinction, so great a proportion of the whole numberperishes under the rigorous treatment that must be their lot in the savagestate, that probably none of those who labour under any original weakness orinfirmity can attain the age of manhood. If they be not cut off as soon as theyare born, they cannot long protract their lives under the severe discipline thatawaits them.20 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_69] In the Spanishprovinces, where the Indians do not live so laborious a life, and are preventedfrom destroying their children, great numbers of them are deformed, dwarfish,mutilated, blind, and deaf.21 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_67]Polygamy seems to have been generally allowed among the Americans, but theprivilege was seldom used, except by the Caciques and chiefs, and now and thenby others in some of the fertile provinces of the South, where subsistence wasmore easily procured. The difficulty of supporting a family confined the mass ofthe people to one wife;22 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_87] andthis difficulty was so generally known and acknowledged, that fathers, beforethey consented to give their daughters in marriage, required unequivocal proofsin the suitor of his skill in hunting, and his consequent ability to support awife and children.23 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_85] The women,it is said, do not marry early;24[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_83] and this seems to be confirmedby the libertinage among them before marriage, so frequently taken notice of bythe missionaries and other writers.25[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1663]The customs above enumerated, which appear to have been generated principally bythe experience of the difficulties attending the rearing of a family, combinedwith the great proportion of children that must necessarily perish under thehardships of savage life, in spite of the best efforts of their parents to savethem,26 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_81] must, without doubt,most powerfully repress the rising generation.When the young savage, by a fortunate train of circumstances, has passed safelythrough the perils of his childhood, other dangers scarcely less formidableawait him on his approach to manhood. The diseases to which man is subject inthe savage state, though fewer in number, are more violent and fatal than thosewhich prevail in civilized society. As savages are wonderfully improvident, andtheir means of subsistence always precarious, they often pass from the extremeof want to exuberant plenty, according to the vicissitudes of fortune in thechace, or to the variety in the productions of the seasons.27[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1665] Their inconsiderate gluttonyin the one case, and their severe abstinence in the other, are equallyprejudicial to the human constitution; and their vigour is accordingly at someseasons impaired by want, and at others by a superfluity of gross aliment, andthe disorders arising from indigestions.28[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_79] These, which may be consideredas the unavoidable consequence of their mode of living, cut off considerablenumbers in the prime of life. They are likewise extremely subject toconsumptions, to pleuretic, asthmatic, and paralytic disorders, brought on bythe immoderate hardships and fatigues which they endure in hunting and war, andby the inclemency of the seasons to which they are continually exposed.29[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1667]The missionaries speak of the Indians in South America as subject to perpetualdiseases for which they know no remedy.30[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_99] Ignorant of the use of the mostsimple herbs, or of any change in their gross diet, they die of these diseasesin great numbers. The jesuit Fauque says, that, in all the different excursionswhich he had made, he scarcely found a single individual of an advanced age.31[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1669] Robertson determines theperiod of human life to be shorter among savages than in well-regulated andindustrious communities.32 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_97]Raynal, notwithstanding his frequent declarations in favour of savage life, saysof the Indians of Canada, that few are so long lived as our people, whose mannerof living is more uniform and tranquil.33[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1671] And Cook and Perouse confirmthese opinions in the remarks which they make on some of the inhabitants of thenorthwest coast of America.34 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_95]In the vast plains of South America, a burning sun operating on the extensiveswamps and the inundations that succeed the rainy season, sometimes generatesdreadful epidemics. The missionaries speak of contagious distempers as frequentamong the Indians, and occasioning at times a great mortality in theirvillages.35 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_93] The small-pox everywhere makes great ravages, as, from want of care, and from confined habitations,very few that are attacked recover from it.36[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_91] The Indians of Paraguay are saidto be extremely subject to contagious distempers, notwithstanding the care andattentions of the Jesuits. The small-pox and malignant fevers, which, from theravages they make, are called plagues, frequently desolate these flourishingmissions, and, according to Ulloa, are the cause that they had not increased inproportion to the time of their establishment, and the profound peace which theyhad enjoyed.37 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1673]These epidemics are not confined to the south. They are mentioned as if theywere not uncommon among the more northern nations;38[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_89] and, in a late voyage to thenorthwest coast of America, captain Vancouver gives an account of a mostextraordinary desolation apparently produced by some distemper of this kind.From New Dungeness he traversed a hundred and fifty miles of the coast withoutseeing the same number of inhabitants. Deserted villages were frequent, each ofwhich was large enough to contain all the scattered savages that had beenobserved in that extent of country. In the different excursions which he made,particularly about Port Discovery, the skulls, limbs, ribs, and backbones, orsome other vestiges of the human body, were scattered promiscuously in greatnumbers; and, as no warlike scars were observed on the bodies of the remainingIndians, and no particular signs of fear and suspicion, the most probableconjecture seems to be, that this depopulation must have been occasioned bypestilential disease.39 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_109] Thesmall-pox appears to be common and fatal among the Indians on this coast. Itsindelible marks were observed on many, and several had lost the sight of one eyefrom it.40 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1675]In general, it may be remarked of savages, that, from their extreme ignorance,the dirt of their persons, and the closeness and filth of their cabins,41[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_107] they lose the advantage whichusually attends a thinly peopled country, that, of being more exempt frompestilential diseases, than those which are fully inhabited. In some parts ofAmerica the houses are built for the reception of many different families, andfourscore or a hundred people are crowded together under the same roof. When thefamilies live separately, the huts are extremely small, close, and wretched,without windows, and with the doors so low, that it is necessary to creep on thehands and knees to enter them.42[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_105] On the northwest coast ofAmerica, the houses are in general of the large kind; and Meares describes oneof most extraordinary dimensions belonging to a chief near Nootka Sound, inwhich eight hundred persons ate, sat, and slept.43[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_103] All voyagers agree with respectto the filth of the habitations, and the personal nastiness of the people onthis coast.44 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1677] Captain Cookdescribes them as swarming with vermin, which they pick off and eat;45[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1679] and the nastiness and stenchof their houses, he says, is equal to their confusion.46[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_101] Perouse declares that theircabins have a nastiness and stench, to which the den of no known animal in theworld can be compared.47 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1681]Under such circumstances, it may be easily imagined what a dreadful havoc anepidemic must make, when once it appears among them; and it does not seemimprobable, that the degree of filth described should generate distempers ofthis nature, as the air of their houses cannot be much purer than the atmosphereof the most crowded cities.Those who escape the dangers of infancy and of disease are constantly exposed tothe chances of war; and notwithstanding the extreme caution of the Americans inconducting their military operations, yet as they seldom enjoy any interval ofpeace, the waste of their numbers in war is considerable.48[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_117] The rudest of the Americannations are well acquainted with the rights of each community to its owndomains.49 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_115] And as it is of theutmost consequence to prevent others from destroying the game in their huntinggrounds, they guard this national property with a jealous attention. Innumerablesubjects of dispute necessarily arise. The neighbouring nations live in aperpetual state of hostility with each other.50[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1683] The very act of increasing inone tribe, must be an act of aggression on its neighbours, as a larger range ofterritory will be necessary to support its increased numbers. The contest willin this case naturally continue, either till the equilibrium is restored bymutual losses, or till the weaker party is exterminated, or driven from itscountry. When the irruption of an enemy desolates their cultivated lands, ordrives them from their hunting grounds, as they have seldom any portable stores,they are generally reduced to extreme want. All the people of the districtinvaded are frequently forced to take refuge in woods or mountains which canafford them no subsistence, and where many of them perish.51[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_113] In such a flight each consultsalone his individual safety. Children desert their parents, and parents considertheir children as strangers. The ties of nature are no longer binding. A fatherwill sell his son for a knife or a hatchet.52[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_111] Famine, and distresses of everykind, complete the destruction of those whom the sword had spared; and in thismanner whole tribes are frequently extinguished.53[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1685]Such a state of things has powerfully contributed to generate that ferociousspirit of warfare observable among savages in general, and most particularlyamong the Americans. Their object in battle is not conquest, but destruction.54[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1687] The life of the victor dependson the death of his enemy; and, in the rancour and fell spirit of revenge withwhich he pursues him, he seems constantly to bear in mind the distresses thatwould be consequent on defeat. Among the Iroquois, the phrase by which theyexpress their resolution of making war against an enemy, is, “Let us go and eatthat nation.” If they solicit the aid of a neighbouring tribe, they invite it toeat broth made of the flesh of their enemies.55[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_125] Among the Abnakis, when a bodyof their warriors enters an enemy’s territory, it is generally divided intodifferent parties of thirty or forty; and the chief says to each, to you isgiven such a hamlet to eat, to you such a village,56[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1689] &c. These expressions remainin the language of some of the tribes, in which the custom of eating theirprisoners taken in war no longer exists. Cannibalism, however, undoubtedlyprevailed in many parts of the new world;57[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_123] and, contrary to the opinion ofDr. Robertson, I cannot but think that it must have had its origin in extremewant, though the custom might afterwards be continued from other motives. Itseems to be a worse compliment to human nature, and to the savage state, toattribute this horrid repast to malignant passions, without the goad ofnecessity, rather than to the great law of self-preservation, which has, attimes, overcome every other feeling even among the most humane and civilizedpeople. When once it had prevailed, though only occasionally, from this cause,the fear that a savage might feel of becoming a repast to his enemies, mighteasily raise the passion of rancour and revenge to so high a pitch, as to urgehim to treat his prisoners in this way, though not prompted at the time byhunger.The missionaries speak of several nations, which appeared to use human fleshwhenever they could obtain it, as they would the flesh of any of the rareranimals.58 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1691] These accounts mayperhaps be exaggerated, though they seem to be confirmed, in a great degree, bythe late voyages to the northwest coast of America, and by Captain Cook’sdescription of the state of society in the southern island of New Zealand.59[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_121] The people of Nootka Soundappear to be cannibals,60 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_119] andthe chief of the district Maquinna is said to be so addicted to this horridbanquet, that, in cold blood, he kills a slave every moon to gratify hisunnatural appetite.61 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1693]The predominant principle of self-preservation, connected in the breast of thesavage, most intimately, with the safety and power of the community to which hebelongs, prevents the admission of any of those ideas of honour and gallantry inwar, which prevail among more civilized nations. To fly from an adversary thatis on his guard, and to avoid a contest where he cannot contend without risk tohis own person, and consequently to his community, is the point of honour withthe American. The odds of ten to one are necessary to warrant an attack on aperson who is armed and prepared to resist, and even then, each is afraid ofbeing the first to advance.62 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_131]The great object of the most renowned warrior, is, by every art of cunning anddeceit, by every mode of stratagem and surprize, that his invention can suggest,to weaken and destroy the tribes of his enemies with the least possible loss tohis own. To meet an enemy on equal terms is regarded as extreme folly. To fallin battle, instead of being reckoned an honourable death,63[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1695] is a misfortune, whichsubjects the memory of a warrior to the imputation of rashness and imprudence.But to lie in wait day after day, till he can rush upon his prey, when mostsecure, and least able to resist him; to steal in the dead of night upon hisenemies, set fire to their huts, and massacre the inhabitants, as they fly nakedand defenceless from the flames,64[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_129] are deeds of glory, which willbe of deathless memory in the breasts of his grateful countrymen.This mode of warfare is evidently generated by a consciousness of thedifficulties attending the rearing of new citizens under the hardships anddangers of savage life. And these powerful causes of destruction may, in someinstances, be so great, as to keep down the population even considerably belowthe means of subsistence; but the fear that the Americans betray of anydiminution of their society, and their apparent wish to increase it, are noproofs that this is generally the case. The country could not probably supportthe addition that is coveted in each society; but an accession of strength toone tribe, opens to it new sources of subsistence in the comparative weakness ofits adversaries; and, on the contrary, a diminution of its numbers, so far fromgiving greater plenty to the remaining members, subjects them to extirpation orfamine from the irruptions of their stronger neighbours.The Chiriguanes, originally only a small part of the tribe of Guaranis, lefttheir native country in Paraguay, and settled in the mountains towards Peru.They found sufficient subsistence in their new country, increased rapidly,attacked their neighbours, and, by superior valour, or superior fortune,gradually exterminated them, and took possession of their lands, occupying agreat extent of country; and having increased, in the course of some years, fromthree or four thousand, to thirty thousand,65[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_127] while the tribes of theirweaker neighbours were daily thinned by famine and the sword.Such instances prove the rapid increase, even of the Americans, under favourablecircumstances, and sufficiently account for the fear in every tribe ofdiminishing its numbers, and the frequent wish to increase them,66[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_137] without supposing asuperabundance of food in the territory actually possessed.That the increase of the Americans is regulated more by the means ofsubsistence, than by any of the other causes that have been mentioned asaffecting their population; or rather, perhaps, I should say, that these causesthemselves are principally regulated by the plenty or scarcity of subsistence,is sufficiently evinced, from the greater frequency of the tribes, and thegreater numbers in each, throughout all those parts of the country, where, fromthe vicinity of lakes or rivers, the superior fertility of the soil, or furtheradvances in improvement, food becomes more abundant. In the interior of theprovinces bordering on the Oronoco, several hundred miles may be traversed indifferent directions, without finding a single hut, or observing the footstepsof a single creature. In some parts of North America, where the climate is morerigorous, and the soil less fertile, the desolation is still greater. Vasttracts of some hundred leagues have been crossed through uninhabited plains andforests.67 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1697] The missionariesspeak of journies of twelve days without meeting with a single soul,68[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_135] and of immense tracts ofcountry, in which scarcely three or four scattered villages were to be found.69[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1699] Some of these deserts did notfurnish game,70 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_133] and weretherefore entirely desolate; others, which were to a certain degree stocked withit, were traversed in the hunting seasons, by parties, who encamped, andremained in different spots, according to the success they met with, and weretherefore really inhabited in proportion to the quantity of subsistence whichthey yielded.71 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1701]Other districts of America are described as comparatively fully peopled; such asthe borders of the great northern lakes, the shores of the Missisippi,Louisiana, and many provinces in South America. The villages here were large,and near each other, in proportion to the superior fruitfulness of the territoryin game and fish, and the advances made by the inhabitants in agriculture.72[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1703] The Indians of the great andpopulous empires of Mexico and Peru, sprung undoubtedly from the same stock, andoriginally possessed the same customs, as their ruder brethren; but the momentthat, by a fortunate train of circumstances, they were led to improve and extendtheir agriculture, a considerable population rapidly followed, in spite of theapathy of the men, or the destructive habits of the women. These habits would,indeed, in a great measure yield to the change of circumstances; and thesubstitution of a more quiet and sedentary life, for a life of perpetualwandering and hardship, would immediately render the women more fruitful, andenable them at the same time to attend to the wants of a larger family.In a general view of the American continent, as described by historians, thepopulation seems to have been spread over the surface very nearly in proportionto the quantity of food, which the inhabitants of the different parts, in theactual state of their industry and improvement, could obtain; and that, with fewexceptions, it pressed hard against this limit, rather than fell short of it,appears, from the frequent recurrence of distress for want of food in all partsof America.Remarkable instances occur, according to Dr. Robertson, of the calamities whichrude nations suffer by famine. As one of them, he mentions an account given byAlvar Nugnez Cabeca de Vaca, one of the Spanish adventurers, who resided almostnine years among the savages of Florida. He describes them as unacquainted withevery species of agriculture, and living chiefly upon the roots of differentplants, which they procure with great difficulty, wandering from place to placein search of them. Sometimes they kill game, sometimes they catch fish, but insuch small quantities, that their hunger is so extreme, as to compel them to eatspiders, the eggs of ants, worms, lizards, serpents, a kind of unctuous earth,and, I am persuaded, he says, that, if in this country there were any stones,they would swallow them. They preserve the bones of fishes and serpents, whichthey grind into powder and eat. The only season when they do not suffer muchfrom famine, is when a certain fruit like the opuntia, or prickly-pear, is ripe;but they are sometimes obliged to travel far from their usual place of residencein order to find it. In another place, he observes, that they are frequentlyreduced to pass two or three days without food.73[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_139]Ellis, in his voyage to Hudson’s Bay, feelingly describes the sufferings of theIndians in that neighbourhood from extreme want. Having mentioned the severityof the climate, he says, “Great as these hardships are which result from therigour of the cold, yet it may justly be affirmed, that they are much inferiorto those which they feel from the scarcity of provisions, and the difficultythey are under of procuring them. A story which is related at the factories, andknown to be true, will sufficiently prove this, and give the compassionatereader a just idea of the miseries to which these unhappy people are exposed.”He then gives an account of a poor Indian and his wife, who, on the failure ofgame, having eaten up all the skins which they wore as clothing, were reduced tothe dreadful extremity of supporting themselves on the flesh of two of theirchildren.74 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_149] In another place hesays, “It has sometimes happened, that the Indians who come in summer to tradeat the factories, missing the succours they expected, have been obliged to singeoff the hair from thousands of beaver skins in order to feed upon the leather.”75 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1705]The Abbé Raynal, who is continually reasoning most inconsistently in hiscomparisons of savage and civilized life, though in one place he speaks of thesavage as morally sure of a competent subsistence, yet in his account of thenations of Canada, he says, that though they lived in a country abounding ingame and fish, yet in some seasons, and sometimes for whole years, this resourcefailed them; and famine then occasioned a great destruction among a people whowere at too great a distance to assist each other.76[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1707]Charlevoix, speaking of the inconveniences and distresses to which themissionaries were subject, observes, that not unfrequently the evils which hehad been describing are effaced by a greater, in comparison of which all theothers are nothing. This is famine. It is true, says he, that the savages canbear hunger with as much patience, as they shew carelessness in providingagainst it; but they are sometimes reduced to extremities beyond their power tosupport.77 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_147]It is the general custom among most of the American nations, even those whichhave made some progress in agriculture, to disperse themselves in the woods atcertain seasons of the year, and to subsist for some months on the produce ofthe chace, as a principal part of their annual supplies.78[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1709] To remain in their villages,exposes them to certain famine;79[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_145] and in the woods they are notalways sure to escape it. The most able hunters sometimes fail of success, evenwhere there is no deficiency of game;80[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_143] and in their forests, on thefailure of this resource, the hunter or the traveller is exposed to the mostcruel want.81 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_141] The Indians, intheir hunting excursions, are sometimes reduced to pass three or four dayswithout food;82 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1711] and amissionary relates an account of some Iroquois who, on one of these occasions,having supported themselves as long as they could, by eating the skins whichthey had with them, their shoes, and the bark of trees, at length, in despair,sacrificed some of the party to support the rest. Out of eleven, five onlyreturned alive.83 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_159]The Indians, in many parts of South America, live in extreme want,84[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1713] and are sometimes destroyed byabsolute famines.85 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1715] Theislands, rich as they appeared to be, were peopled fully up to the level oftheir produce. If a few Spaniards settled in any district, such a small additionof supernumerary mouths soon occasioned a severe dearth of provisions.86[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_157] The flourishing Mexican empirewas in the same state in this respect; and Cortez often found the greatestdifficulty in procuring subsistence for his small body of soldiers.87[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_155] Even the Missions of Paraguay,with all the care and foresight of the Jesuits, and notwithstanding that theirpopulation was kept down by frequent epidemicks, were by no means totally exemptfrom the pressure of want. The Indians of the Mission of St. Michael arementioned as having at one time increased so much, that the lands, capable ofcultivation in their neighbourhood, produced only half of the grain necessaryfor their support.88 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1717] Longdroughts often destroyed their cattle,89[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_153] and occasioned a failure oftheir crops; and on these occasions some of the Missions were reduced to themost extreme indigence, and would have perished from famine, but for theassistance of their neighbours.90[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1719]The late voyages to the northwest coast of America, confirm these accounts ofthe frequent pressure of want in savage life, and shew the uncertainty of theresource of fishing, which seems to afford, in general, the most plentifulharvest of food that is furnished by unassisted nature. The sea on the coastnear Nootka Sound is seldom or never so much frozen as to prevent theinhabitants from having access to it. Yet from the very great precautions theyuse in laying up stores for the winter, and their attention to prepare andpreserve whatever food is capable of it, for the colder seasons, it is evidentthat the sea at these times yields no fish; and it appears, that they oftenundergo very great hardships from want of provisions in the cold months.91[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_151] During a Mr. Maccay’s stay atNootka Sound, from 1786 to 1787, the length and severity of the winteroccasioned a famine. The stock of dried fish was expended, and no fresh suppliesof any kind were to be caught, so that the natives were obliged to submit to afixed allowance, and the chiefs brought every day to our countrymen the statedmeal of seven dried herrings’ heads. Mr. Meares says, that the perusal of thisgentleman’s journal would shock any mind tinctured with humanity.92[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_167]Captain Vancouver mentions some of the people to the north of Nootka Sound, asliving very miserably on a paste made of the inner bark of the pine tree, andcockles.93 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1721] In one of the boatexcursions, a party of Indians was met with who had some halibut, but, thoughvery high prices were offered, they could not be induced to part with any. This,as Captain Vancouver observes, was singular, and indicated a very scantysupply.94 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_165] At Nootka Sound inthe year 1794, fish had become very scarce, and bore an exorbitant price; as,either from the badness of the season, or from neglect, the inhabitants hadexperienced the greatest distress for want of provisions during the winter.95[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1727]Perouse describes the Indians in the neighbourhood of Port Francois, as livingduring the summer in the greatest abundance by fishing, but exposed in thewinter to perish from want.96 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_163]It is not, therefore, as Lord Kaimes imagines, that the American tribes havenever increased sufficiently to render the pastoral or agricultural statenecessary to them;97 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1723] but, fromsome cause or other, they have not adopted in any great degree these moreplentiful modes of procuring subsistence, and therefore, cannot have increasedso as to become populous. If hunger alone could have prompted the savage tribesof America to such a change in their habits, I do not conceive that there wouldhave been a single nation of hunters and fishers remaining; but it is evident,that some fortunate train of circumstances, in addition to this stimulus, isnecessary for this purpose; and it is undoubtedly probable, that these arts ofobtaining food, will be first invented and improved in those spots that are bestsuited to them, and where the natural fertility of the situation, by allowing agreater number of people to subsist together, would give the fairest chance tothe inventive powers of the human mind.Among most of the American tribes that we have been considering, so great adegree of equality prevailed, that all the members of each community would benearly equal sharers in the general hardships of savage life, and in thepressure of occasional famines. But in many of the more southern nations, as inBagota,98 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1725] and among theNatchez,99 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_161] and particularly inMexico and Peru, where a great distinction of ranks prevailed, and the lowerclasses were in a state of absolute servitude,100[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_171] it is evident that, on occasionof any failure of subsistence, these would be the principal sufferers, and thepositive checks to population would act almost exclusively on this part of thecommunity.The very extraordinary depopulation that has taken place among the AmericanIndians, may appear to some to contradict the theory which is intended to beestablished; but it will be found that the causes of this rapid diminution mayall be resolved into the three great checks to population that have been stated;and it is not asserted, that these checks, operating from particularcircumstances with unusual force, may not in some instances be more powerfuleven than the principle of increase.The insatiable fondness of the Indians for spirituous liquors,101[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1729] which, according toCharlevoix, is a rage that passes all expression,102[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1731] by producing among themperpetual quarrels and contests, which often terminate fatally, by exposing themto a new train of disorders which their mode of life, unfits them to contendwith, and, by deadening and destroying the generative faculty in its verysource, may alone be considered as a vice adequate to produce the presentdepopulation. In addition to this, it should be observed, that almost everywhere the connexion of the Indians with Europeans, has tended to break theirspirit, to weaken or to give a wrong direction to their industry, and inconsequence to diminish the sources of subsistence. In St. Domingo, the Indiansneglected purposely to cultivate their lands in order to starve out their crueloppressors.103 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1733] In Peru andChili, the forced industry of the natives was fatally directed to the digginginto the bowels of the earth, instead of cultivating its surface; and among thenorthern nations, the extreme desire to purchase European spirits, directed theindustry of the greatest part of them, almost exclusively, to the procuring ofpeltry for the purpose of this exchange,104[18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1735] which would prevent theirattention to the more fruitful sources of subsistence, and at the same time tendrapidly to destroy the produce of the chace. The number of wild animals, in allthe known parts of America, is probably even more diminished than the number ofpeople.105 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_169] The attention toagriculture has every where slackened, rather than increased, as might at firsthave been expected, from European connexion. In no part of America, either Northor South, do we hear of any of the Indian nations living in great plenty, inconsequence of their diminished numbers. It may not, therefore, be very far fromthe truth, to say, that even now, in spite of all the powerful causes ofdestruction that have been mentioned, the average population of the Americannations is, with few exceptions, on a level with the average quantity of food,which in the present state of their industry they can obtain.NOTES1 [18_IV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_42].

The general introductionof fire-arms among the Indians, has probably greatly contributed to thediminution of the wild animals."},{"pageContent":"CHAP. V.Of the Checks to Population in the Islands of the South Sea.THE Abbé Raynal speaking of the ancient state of the British isles, and ofislanders in general, says of them: “It is among these people that we trace theorigin of that multitude of singular institutions that retard the progress ofpopulation. Anthropophagy, the castration of males, the infibulation of females,late marriages, the consecration of virginity, the approbation of celibacy, thepunishments exercised against girls who become mothers at too early an age,” 1[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_175] &c. These customs, caused by asuperabundance of population in islands, have been carried, he says, to thecontinents, where philosophers of our days are still employed to investigate thereason of them. The Abbé does not seem to be aware, that a savage tribe inAmerica, surrounded by enemies, or a civilized and populous nation, hemmed in byothers in the same state, is in many respects in a similar situation. Though thebarriers to a further increase of population be not so well defined, and so opento common observation, on continents, as on islands, yet they still presentobstacles that are nearly as insurmountable: and the emigrant, impatient of thedistresses which he felt in his own country, is by no means secure of findingrelief in another. There is probably no island yet known, the produce of whichcould not be further increased. This is all that can be said of the whole earth.Both are peopled up to their actual produce. And the whole earth is in thisrespect like an island. But as the bounds to the number of people on islands,particularly when they are of small extent, are so narrow, and so distinctlymarked, that every person must see and acknowlege them, an inquiry into thechecks to population on those of which we have the most authentic accounts mayperhaps tend considerably to illustrate the present subject. The question thatis asked in captain Cook’s first voyage, with respect to the thinly scatteredsavages of New Holland, “By what means the inhabitants of this country arereduced to such a num-“ber as it can subsist?” 2[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_173] may be asked with equalpropriety of the most populous islands in the South Sea, or of the best peopledcountries in Europe and Asia. The question, applied generally, appears to me tobe highly curious, and to lead to the elucidation of some of the most obscure,yet important points, in the history of human society. I cannot so clearly andconcisely describe the precise aim of the first part of the present work, as bysaying, that it is an endeavour to answer this question so applied.Of the large islands of New Guinea, New Britain, New Caledonia, and the NewHebrides, little is known with certainty. The state of society in them isprobably very similar to that which prevails among many of the savage nations ofAmerica. They appear to be inhabited by a number of different tribes who areengaged in frequent hostilities with each other. The chiefs have littleauthority; and private property being in consequence insecure, provisions havebeen rarely found on them in abundance.3[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_179] With the large island of NewZealand we are better acquainted; but not in a manner to give us a favourableimpression of the state of society among its inhabitants. The picture of itdrawn by captain Cook in his three different voyages, contains some of thedarkest shades that are any where to be met with in the history of human nature.The state of perpetual hostility in which the different tribes of these peoplelive with each other, seems to be even more striking than among the savages ofany part of America;4 [19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_177] andtheir custom of eating human flesh, and even their relish for that kind of food,are established beyond a possibility of doubt.5[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1737] Captain Cook, who is by nomeans inclined to exaggerate the vices of savage life, says of the natives inthe neighbourhood of Queen Charlotte’s Sound, “If I had followed the advice ofall our pretended friends, I might have extirpated the whole race; for thepeople of each hamlet or village, by turns, applied to me to destroy the other.One would have thought it almost impossible that so striking a proof of thedivided state in which these miserable people live, could have been assigned.”6[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1739] And in the same chapterfurther on, he says, “From my own observations, and the information ofTaweiharooa, it appears to me, that the New Zealanders must live under perpetualapprehensions of being destroyed by each other; there being few of their tribesthat have not, as they think, sustained wrongs from some other tribes, whichthey are continually upon the watch to revenge. And perhaps the desire of a goodmeal may be no small incitement.****Their method of executing their horribledesigns, is by stealing upon the adverse party in the night; and if they findthem unguarded (which, however, I believe is very seldom the case) they killevery one indiscriminately, not even sparing the women and children. When themassacre is completed, they either feast and gorge themselves on the spot, orcarry off as many of the dead bodies as they can, and devour them at home withacts of brutality too shocking to be described.****To give quarter, or to takeprisoners, makes no part of the military law, so that the vanquished can onlysave their lives by flight. This perpetual state of war, and destructive methodof conducting it, operates so strongly in producing habitual circumspection,that one hardly ever finds a New Zealander off his guard, either by night or byday.”7 [19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_185]As these observations occur in the last voyage, in which, the errors of formeraccounts would have been corrected, and as a constant state of warfare is hererepresented as prevailing to such a degree, that it may be considered as theprincipal check to the population of New Zealand, little need be added on thissubject. We are not informed whether any customs are practised by the womenunfavourable to population. If such be known, they are probably never resortedto, except in times of great distress; as each tribe will naturally wish toincrease the number of its members, in order to give itself greater power ofattack and defence. But the vagabond life which the women of the southern islandlead, and the constant state of alarm in which they live, being obliged totravel and work with arms in their hands,8[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1741] must undoubtedly be veryunfavourable to gestation, and tend greatly to prevent large families.Yet, powerful as these checks to population are, it appears, from the recurrenceof seasons of scarcity, that they seldom repress the number of people below theaverage means of subsistence. “That such seasons there are (Captain Cook says)our observations leave us no room to doubt.”9[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_183] Fish is a principal part oftheir food, which, being only to be procured on the sea coast, and at certaintimes,10 [19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1743] must always beconsidered as a precarious resource. It must be extremely difficult to dry andpreserve any considerable stores in a state of society subject to such constantalarms; particularly, as we may suppose, that the bays and creeks most aboundingin fish would most frequently be the subject of obstinate contest, to people whowere wandering in search of food.11[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_181] The vegetable productions are,the fern root, yams, clams, and potatoes.12[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1745] The three last are raised bycultivation, and are seldom found on the southern island, where agriculture isbut little known.13 [19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_193] On theoccasional failure of these scanty resources from unfavourable seasons, it maybe imagined that the distress must be dreadful. At such periods it does not seemimprobable, that the desire of a good meal should give additional force to thedesire of revenge, and that they should be “perpetually destroying each other byviolence, as the only alternative of perishing by hunger.”14[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1747]If we turn our eyes from the thinly scattered inhabitants of New Zealand, to thecrowded shores of Otaheite and the Society Islands, a different scene opens toour view. All apprehension of dearth seems at first sight to be banished from acountry that is described to be fruitful as the garden of the Hesperides.15[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_191] But this first impressionwould be immediately corrected by a moment’s reflection. Happiness and plentyhave always been considered as the most powerful causes of increase. In adelightful climate, where few diseases are known, and the women are condemned tono severe fatigues, why should not these causes operate with a forceunparalleled in less favourable regions? Yet, if they did, where could thepopulation find room and food in such circumscribed limits? If the numbers inOtaheite, not 40 leagues in circuit, surprised Captain Cook, when he calculatedthem at two hundred and four thousand,16[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_189] where could they be disposedof in a single century, when they would amount to above three millions,supposing them to double their numbers every twenty-five years.17[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_187] Each island of the group wouldbe in a similar situation. The removal from one to another, would be a change ofplace, but not a change of the species of distress. Effectual emigration, oreffectual importation, would be utterly excluded, from the situation of theislands, and the state of navigation among their inhabitants.The difficulty, here, is reduced to so narrow a compass, is so clear, precise,and forcible, that we cannot escape from it. It cannot be answered in the usualvague and inconsiderate manner, by talking of emigration, and furthercultivation. In the present instance we cannot but acknowledge, that the one isimpossible, and the other glaringly inadequate. The fullest conviction muststare us in the face, that the people on this group of islands could notcontinue to double their numbers every twenty-five years; and before we proceedto inquire into the state of society on them, we must be perfectly certain,that, unless a perpetual miracle render the women barren, we shall be able totrace some very powerful checks to population in the habits of the people.The successive accounts that we have received of Otaheite and the neighbouringislands, leave us no room to doubt the existence of the Eareeoie societies18[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_201] which have justly occasionedso much surprise among civilized nations. They have been so often described,that little more need be said of them here, than that promiscuous intercourseand infanticide appear to be their fundamental laws. They consist exclusively ofthe higher classes; “and (according to Mr. Anderson19[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_199]) so agreeable is thislicentious plan of life to their disposition, that the most beautiful of bothsexes thus commonly spend their youthful days, habituated to the practice ofenormities that would disgrace the most savage tribes.****When an Eareeoie womanis delivered of a child, a piece of cloth dipped in water is applied to themouth and nose which suffocates it.”20[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_197] Captain Cook observes, “It iscertain, that these societies greatly prevent the increase of the superiorclasses of people of which they are composed.”21[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1749] Of the truth of thisobservation there can be no doubt.Though no particular institutions of the same nature have been found among thelower classes; yet the vices which form their most prominent features are buttoo generally spread. Infanticide is not confined to the Eareeoies. It ispermitted to all; and as its prevalence, among the higher classes of the people,has removed from it all odium, or imputation of poverty, it is probably oftenadopted, rather as a fashion, than a resort of necessity, and appears to bepractised familiarly and without reserve.It is a very just observation of Hume, that the permission of infanticidegenerally contributes to increase the population of a country.22[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_195] By removing the fears of toonumerous a family, it encourages marriage, and the powerful yearnings of natureprevent parents from resorting to so cruel an expedient, except in extremecases. The fashion of the Eareeoie societies in Otaheite and its neighbouringislands, may have made them an exception to this observation, and the custom hasprobably here a contrary tendency.The debauchery and promiscuous intercourse which prevail among the lower classesof people, though in some instances they may have been exaggerated, areestablished to a great extent, on unquestionable authority. Captain Cook, in aprofessed endeavour to rescue the women of Otaheite from a too generalimputation of licentiousness, acknowledges that there are more of this characterhere, than in other countries, making at the same time a remark of a mostdecisive nature, by observing, that the women who thus conduct themselves, donot in any respect lower their rank in society, but mix indiscriminately withthose of the most virtuous character.23[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_205]The common marriages in Otaheite are without any other ceremony than a present,from the man to the parents of the girl. And this seems to be rather a bargainwith them for permission to try their daughter, than an absolute contract for awife. If the father should think that he has not been sufficiently paid for hisdaughter, he makes no scruple of forcing her to leave her friend, and to cohabitwith another person who may be more liberal. The man is always at liberty tomake a new choice. Should his consort become pregnant, he may kill the child,and after that continue his connexion with the mother or leave her, according tohis pleasure. It is only when he has adopted a child, and suffered it to live,that the parties are considered as in the marriage state. A younger wife,however, may afterwards be joined to the first; but the changing of connexionsis much more general than this plan, and is a thing so common, that they speakof it with great indifference.24[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1751] Libertinage before marriage,seems to be no objection to a union of this kind ultimately.The checks to population from such a state of society would alone appearsufficient to counteract the effects of the most delightful climate and the mostexuberant plenty. Yet these are not all. The wars between the inhabitants of thedifferent islands, and their civil contentions among themselves, are frequent,and sometimes carried on in a very destructive manner.25[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_203] Besides the waste of humanlife in the field of battle, the conquerors generally ravage the enemy’sterritory, kill or carry off the hogs and poultry, and reduce as much aspossible the means of future subsistence. The island of Otaheite which, in theyears 1767 and 1768, swarmed with hogs and fowls, was, in 1773, so ill suppliedwith these animals, that hardly any thing could induce the owners to part withthem. This was attributed by Captain Cook principally to the wars which hadtaken place during that interval.26[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_207] On Captain Vancouver’s visitto Otaheite in 1791, he found that most of his friends that he had left in 1777,were dead; that there had been many wars since that time, in some of which, thechiefs of the western districts of Otaheite had joined the enemy; and that theking had been for a considerable time completely worsted, and his own districtsentirely laid waste. Most of the animals, plants, and herbs, which Captain Cookhad left, had been destroyed by the ravages of war.27[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1753]The human sacrifices which are frequent in Otaheite, though alone sufficientstrongly to fix the stain of barbarism on the character of the natives, do notprobably occur in such considerable numbers as materially to affect thepopulation of the country; and the diseases, though they have been dreadfullyincreased by European contact, were before peculiarly lenient; and even for sometime afterwards, were not marked by any extraordinary fatality.28[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1755]The great checks to increase, appear to be the vices of promiscuous intercourse,infanticide, and war, each of these operating with very considerable force. Yetpowerful in the prevention and destruction of life as these causes must be, theyhave not always kept down the population to the level of the means ofsubsistence. According to Mr. Anderson, “Notwithstanding the extreme fertilityof the island, a famine frequently happens in which it is said many perish.Whether this be owing to the failure of some seasons, to over-population, whichmust sometimes almost necessarily happen; or wars, I have not been able todetermine; though the truth of the fact may fairly be inferred from the greateconomy that they observe with respect to their food, even when there isplenty.”29 [19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1757] After a dinnerwith a chief at Ulietea, Captain Cook observed, that, when the company rose,many of the common people rushed in, to pick up the crumbs which had fallen, andfor which they searched the leaves very narrowly. Several people daily attendedthe ships, and assisted the butchers for the sake of the entrails of the hogswhich were killed. In general, little seemed to fall to their share exceptoffals. “It must, however, be owned,” Captain Cook says, that they areexceedingly careful of every kind of provision, and waste nothing that can beeaten by man, flesh and fish especially.”30[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1759]From Mr. Anderson’s account, it appears, that a very small portion of animalfood falls to the lot of the lower class of people, and then, it is either fish,sea-eggs, or other marine productions; for they seldom or never eat pork. Theking or principal chief, is alone able to furnish this luxury every day; and theinferior chiefs, according to their riches, once a week, fortnight, or month.31[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_211] When the hogs and fowls havebeen diminished by wars, or too great consumption, a prohibition is laid uponthese articles of food, which continues in force sometimes for several months,or even for a year or two, during which time, of course, they multiply veryfast, and become again plentiful.32[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1761] The common diet even of theEarecoies, who are among the principal people of the islands, is, according toMr. Anderson, made up of at least nine tenths of vegetable food.33[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1763] And, as a distinction ofranks is so strongly marked, and the lives and property of the lower classes ofpeople appear to depend absolutely on the will of their chiefs, we may wellimagine that these chiefs will often live in plenty while their vassals andservants are pinched with want.From the late accounts of Otaheite, in the Missionary Voyage, it would appear,that the depopulating causes above enumerated, have operated with mostextraordinary force since Captain Cook’s last visit. A rapid succession ofdestructive wars, during a part of that interval, is taken notice of in theintermediate visit of Captain Vancouver;34[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_209] and, from the small proportionof women remarked by the Missionaries,35[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1765] we may infer that a greaternumber of female infants had been destroyed than formerly. This scarcity ofwomen would naturally increase the vice of promiscuous intercourse, and, aidedby the ravages of European diseases, strike most effectually at the root ofpopulation.36 [19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1767]It is probable that Captain Cook, from the data on which he founded hiscalculation, may have overrated the population of Otaheite, and perhaps theMissionaries have rated it too low;37[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1769] but I have no doubt that thepopulation has very considerably decreased since Captain Cook’s visit, from thedifferent accounts that are given of the habits of the people, with regard toeconomy, at the different periods. Captain Cook and Mr. Anderson agree indescribing their extreme carefulness of every kind of food; and Mr. Anderson,apparently after a very attentive investigation of the subject, mentions thefrequent recurrence of famines. The Missionaries, on the contrary, though theystrongly notice the distress from this cause in the Friendly Islands and theMarquesas, speak of the productions of Otaheite as being in the greatestprofusion; and observe, that, notwithstanding the horrible waste committed atfeastings, and by the Eareeoie society, want is seldom known.38[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_215]It would appear from these accounts, that the population of Otaheite is atpresent repressed considerably below the average means of subsistence, but itwould be premature to conclude that it will continue long so. The variations inthe state of the island which were observed by Captain Cook, in his differentvisits, appear to prove that there are marked oscillations in its prosperity andpopulation.39 [19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1771] And this isexactly what we should suppose from theory. We cannot imagine that thepopulation of any of these islands has, for ages past, remained stationary at afixed number, or that it can have been regularly increasing, according to anyrate, however flow. Great fluctuations must necessarily have taken place.Overpopulousness would at all times increase the natural propensity of savagesto war; and the enmities occasioned by aggressions of this kind, would continueto spread devastation, long after the original inconvenience, which might haveprompted them, had ceased to be felt.40[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1773] The distresses experiencedfrom one or two unfavourable seasons, operating on a crowded population, whichwas before living with the greatest economy, and pressing hard against thelimits of its food, would, in such a state of society, occasion the more generalprevalence of infanticide and promiscuous intercourse;41[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_213] and these depopulating causeswould, in the same manner, continue to act with increased force, for some timeafter the occasion which had aggravated them was at an end. A change of habitsto a certain degree, gradually produced by a change of circumstarices, wouldsoon restore the population, which could not long be kept below its naturallevel, without the most extreme violence. How far European contact may operatein Otaheite with this extreme violence, and prevent it from recovering itsformer population, is a point which experience only can determine. But shouldthis be the case, I have no doubt that on tracing the causes of it, we shouldfind them to be aggravated vice and misery.Of the other islands in the Pacific Ocean we have a less intimate knowledge thanof Otaheite; but our information is sufficient to assure us, that the state ofsociety in all the principal groups of these islands is, in most respects,extremely similar. Among the Friendly and Sandwich islanders, the same feudalsystem, and feudal turbulence, the same extraordinary power of the chiefs, anddegraded state of the lower orders of society, and nearly the same promiscuousintercourse among a great part of the people, have been found to prevail, as atOtaheite.In the Friendly Islands, though the power of the king was said to be unlimited,and the life and property of the subject at his disposal; yet it appeared, thatsome of the other chiefs acted like petty sovereigns, and frequently thwartedhis measures, of which he often complained. “But however independent (CaptainCook says) on the despotic power of the king the great men may be, we sawinstances enough to prove, that the lower orders of people have no property norsafety for their persons, but at the will of the chiefs, to whom theyrespectively belong.”42 [19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_221] Thechiefs often beat the inferior people most unmercifully,43[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1775] and when any of them werecaught in a theft on board the ships, their masters, far from interceding forthem, would often advise the killing of them,44[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1777] which, as the chiefsthemselves appeared to have no great horror of the crime of theft, could onlyarise from their considering the lives of these poor people as absolutely of novalue.Captain Cook, in his first visit to the Sandwich Islands, had reason to thinkthat external wars, and internal commotions, were extremely frequent among thenatives.45 [19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_219] And CaptainVancouver, in his later account, strongly notices the dreadful devastations inmany of the islands from these causes. Incessant contentions had occasionedalterations in the different governments since Captain Cook’s visit. Only onechief of all that were known at that time was living; and, on inquiry, itappeared that few had died a natural death, most of them having been killed inthese unhappy contests.46 [19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1779] Thepower of the chiefs over the inferior classes of the people in the SandwichIslands appears to be absolute. The people, on the other hand, pay them the mostimplicit obedience; and this state of servility has manifestly a great effect indebasing both their minds and bodies.47[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_217] The gradations of rank seem tobe even more strongly marked here, than in the other islands, as the chiefs ofhigher rank behave to those who are lower in this scale in the most haughty andoppressive manner.48 [19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1781]It is not known that, either in the Friendly, or Sandwich Islands, infanticideis practised, or that any institutions are established similar to the Eareeoiesocieties in Otaheite; but it seems to be stated on unquestionable authority,that prostitution is extensively diffused, and prevails to a great degree amongthe lower classes of women,49 [19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_229]which must always operate as a most powerful check to population. It seemshighly probable, that the toutous, or servants, who spend the greatest part oftheir time in attendance upon the chiefs,50[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1783] do not often marry; and it isevident that the polygamy allowed to the superior people, must tend greatly toencourage and aggravate the vice of promiscuous intercourse among the inferiorclasses.Were it an established fact, that in the more fertile islands of the PacificOcean, very little, or nothing, was suffered from poverty and want of food; aswe could not expect to find among savages in such climates any great degree ofvirtuous restraint, the theory on the subject would naturally lead us toconclude, that vice, including war, was the principal check to their population.The accounts which we have of these islands strongly confirm this conclusion. Inthe three great groups of islands which have been noticed, vice appears to be amost prominent feature. In Easter Island, from the great disproportion of themales to the females,51 [19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1785] itcan scarcely be doubted that infanticide prevails, though the fact may not havecome to the knowledge of any of our navigators. Perouse seemed to think that thewomen in each district were common property to the men of that district,52[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_227] though the numbers of childrenwhich he saw,53 [19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1787] would rathertend to contradict this opinion. The fluctuations in the population of EasterIsland appear to have been very considerable, since its first discovery byRoggewein in 1722, though it cannot have been much affected by Europeanintercourse. From the description of Perouse, it appeared, at the time of hisvisit, to be recovering its population, which had been in a very low state,probably either from drought, civil dissensions, or the prevalence in an extremedegree of infanticide, and promiscuous intercourse. When Captain Cook visited itin his second voyage, he calculated the population at six or seven hundred,54[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_225] Perouse at two thousand;55[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1789] and, from the number ofchildren which he observed, and the number of new houses that were building, heconceived that the population was on the increase.56[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_223]In the Marianne Islands, according to Pere Gobien, a very great number 57[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1791] of the young men remainedunmarried, lived like the members of the Eareeoie society in Otaheite, and weredistinguished by a similar name.58[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_235] In the island of Formosa, itis said, that the women were not allowed to bring children into the world beforethe age of thirty-five. If they were with child prior to that period, anabortion was effected by the priestess, and till the husband was forty years ofage, the wife continued to live in her father’s house, and was only seen bystealth.59 [19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_233]The transient visits that have been made to some other islands, and theimperfect accounts that we have of them, do not enable us to enter into anyparticular detail of their customs; but, from the general similarity of thesecustoms, as far as has been observed, we have reason to think, that, though theymay not be marked by some of the more atrocious peculiarities which have beenmentioned, vicious habits with respect to women, and wars, are the principalchecks to their population.These, however, are not all. On the subject of the happy state of plenty inwhich the natives of the South Sea islands have been said to live, I am inclinedto think, that our imaginations have been carried beyond the truth, by theexuberant descriptions which have sometimes been given of these delightfulspots. The not unfrequent pressure of want, even in Otaheite, mentioned inCaptain Cook’s last voyage, has undeceived us with regard to the most fertile ofall these islands; and from the Missionary Voyage it appears, that at certaintimes of the year, when the bread fruit is out of season, all suffer a temporaryscarcity. At Oheitahoo, one of the Marquesas, it amounted to hunger, and thevery animals were pinched for want of food. At Tongataboo, the principal of theFriendly Islands, the chiefs, to secure plenty, changed their abodes to otherislands,60 [19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_231] and at times manyof the natives suffered much from want.61[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_239] In the Sandwich Islands, longdroughts sometimes occur;62 [19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1793]hogs and yams are often very scarce,63[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_237] and visitors are received withan unwelcome austerity very different from the profuse benevolence of Otaheite.In New Caledonia, the inhabitants feed upon spiders,64[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1795] and are sometimes reduced toeat great pieces of steatite to appease the cravings of their hunger.65[19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1797]These facts strongly prove, that in whatever abundance the productions of theseislands may be found at certain periods, or however they may be checked byignorance, wars, and other causes, the average population, generally speaking,presses hard against the limits of the average food. In a state of society,where the lives of the inferior orders of the people seem to be considered bytheir superiors as absolutely of no value, it is evident that we are very liableto be deceived with regard to the appearances of abundance; and we may easilyconceive, that hogs and vegetables might be exchanged in great profusion forEuropean commodities by the principal proprietors, while their vassals andslaves were suffering severely from want.I cannot conclude this general review of that department of human society, whichhas been classed under the name of savage life, without observing, that the onlyadvantage in it above civilized life that I can discover, is the possession of agreater degree of leisure by the mass of the people. There is less work to bedone, and consequently there is less labour. When we consider the incessant toilto which the lower classes of society in civilized life are condemned, thiscannot but appear to us a striking advantage; but it is probably overbalanced bygreater disadvantages. In all those countries where provisions are procured withfacility, a most tyrannical distinction of rank prevails. Blows, and violationsof property, seem to be matters of course; and the lower classes of the peopleare in a state of comparative degradation much below what is known in civilizednations.In that part of savage life where a great degree of equality obtains, thedifficulty of procuring food, and the hardships of incessant war, create adegree of labour not inferior to that which is exerted by the lower classes ofthe people in civilized society, though much more unequally divided. But thoughwe may compare the labour of these two classes of human society, theirprivations and sufferings will admit of no comparison. Nothing appears to me toplace this in so striking a point of view, as the whole tenor of education amongthe ruder tribes of savages in America. Every thing that can contribute to teachthe most unmoved patience under the severest pains and misfortunes, every thingthat tends to harden the heart, and narrow all the sources of sympathy, is mostsedulously inculcated in the savage. The civilized man, on the contrary, thoughhe may be advised to bear evil with patience when it comes, is not instructed tobe always expecting it. Other virtues are to be called into action besidesfortitude. He is taught to feel for his neighbour, or even his enemy indistress; to encourage, and expand his social affections; and in general, toenlarge the sphere of pleasurable emotions. The obvious inference from these twodifferent modes of education is, that the civilized man hopes to enjoy, thesavage expects only to suffer.The preposterous system of Spartan discipline, and that unnatural absorption ofevery private feeling in concern for the public, which has sometimes been soabsurdly admired, could never have existed but among a people, exposed toperpetual hardships and privations from incessant war, and in a state, under theconstant fear of dreadful reverses of fortune. Instead of considering thesephenomena as indicating any peculiar tendency to fortitude and patriotism in thedisposition of the Spartans, I should merely consider them as a strongindication of the miserable and almost savage state of Sparta, and of Greece ingeneral at that time. Like the commodities in a market, those virtues will beproduced in the greatest quantity for which there is the greatest demand; andwhere patience, under pain and privations, and extravagant patriotic sacrifices,are the most called for, it is a melancholy indication of the misery of thepeople, and the insecurity of the state.NOTES1 [19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_174].

I feel very little doubtthat this rate of increase is much slower than would really take place,supposing every check to be removed. If Otaheite, with its present produce, werepeopled only with an hundred persons, the two sexes in equal numbers, and eachman constant to one woman, I cannot but think, that for five or six successiveperiods, the increase would be more rapid than in any instance hitherto known,and that they would probably double their numbers in less than fifteen years.18 [19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_200].

In a very healthy climate, where the habits of the people werefavourable to population, and a community of goods was established, as noindividual would have reason to fear particular poverty from a large family, thegovernment would be in a manner compelled to take upon itself the suppression ofthe population by law; and as this would be the greatest violation of everynatural feeling, there cannot be a more forcible argument against a community ofgoods.60 [19_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_230].

VI.Of the Checks to Population among the ancient Inhabitants of the North ofEurope.A HISTORY of the early migrations and settlements of mankind, with the motiveswhich prompted them, would illustrate in a striking manner the constant tendencyin the human race to increase beyond the means of subsistence. Without somegeneral law of this nature, it would seem as if the world could never have beenpeopled. A state of sloth, and not of restlessness and activity, seems evidentlyto be the natural state of man; and this latter disposition could not have beengenerated but by the strong goad of necessity, though it might afterwards becontinued by habit, and the new associations that were formed from it, thespirit of enterprize, and the thirst of martial glory.We are told, that Abram and Lot had so great substance in cattle, that the landwould not bear them both, that they might dwell together. There was strifebetween their herdsmen. And Abram proposed to Lot to separate, and said, “Is notthe whole land before thee? If thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go tothe right; if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.”1[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_241]This simple observation and proposal is a striking illustration of that greatspring of action which overspread the whole earth with people, and in theprogress of time, drove some of the less fortunate inhabitants of the globe,yielding to irresistible pressure, to seek a scanty subsistence in the burningdeserts of Asia and Africa, and the frozen regions of Siberia and North America.The first migrations would naturally find no other obstacles than the nature ofthe country; but when a considerable part of the earth had been peopled, thoughbut thinly, the possessors of these districts would not yield them to otherswithout a struggle; and the redundant inhabitants of any of the more centralspots, could not find room for themselves without expelling their nearestneighbours, or at least passing through their territories, which wouldnecessarily give occasion to frequent contests.The middle latitudes of Europe and Asia, seem to have been occupied at an earlyperiod of history, by nations of shepherds. Thucydides gave it as his opinion,that the civilized states of Europe and Asia, in his time, could not resist theScythians united. Yet a country in pasture cannot possibly support so manyinhabitants as a country in tillage; but what renders nations of shepherds soformidable, is the power which they possess of moving altogether, and thenecessity they frequently feel of exerting this power in search of fresh pasturefor their herds. A tribe that is rich in cattle has an immediate plenty of food.Even the parent stock may be devoured in case of absolute necessity. The womenlive in greater ease than among nations of hunters, and are consequently moreprolific. The men, bold in their united strength, and confiding in their powerof procuring pasture for their cattle by change of place, feel probably but fewfears about providing for a family. These combined causes soon produce theirnatural and invariable effect, an extended population. A more frequent and rapidchange of place then becomes necessary. A wider and more extensive territory issuccessively occupied. A broader desolation extends all around them. Wantpinches the less fortunate members of the society; and at length theimpossibility of supporting such a number together, becomes too evident to beresisted. Young scions are then pushed out from the parent stock, and instructedto explore fresh regions, and to gain happier seats for themseves by theirswords.“The world is all before them where to chuse.”Restless from present distress, flushed with the hope of fairer prospects, andanimated with the spirit of hardy enterprize, these daring adventurers arelikely to become formidable adversaries to all who oppose them. The inhabitantsof countries long settled, engaged in the peaceful occupations of trade andagriculture, would not often be able to resist the energy of men acting undersuch powerful motives of exertion. And the frequent contests with tribes in thesame circumstances with themselves, would be so many struggles for existence,and would be fought with a desperate courage, inspired by the reflection, thatdeath would be the punishment of defeat, and life the prize of victory.In these savage contests, many tribes must have been utterly exterminated. Manyprobably perished by hardships and famine. Others, whose leading star had giventhem a happier direction, became great and powerful tribes, and in their turnsent off fresh adventurers in search of other feats. These would at first oweallegiance to their parent tribe; but in a short time the ties that bound themwould be little felt, and they would remain friends, or become enemies,according as their power, their ambition, or their convenience, might dictate.The prodigious waste of human life occasioned by this perpetual struggle forroom and food, would be more than supplied by the mighty power of population,acting in some degree unshackled from the constant habit of migration. Aprevailing hope of bettering their condition by change of place, a constantexpectation of plunder, a power, even, if distressed, of selling their childrenas slaves, added to the natural carelesness of the Barbaric character, would allconspire to raise a population which would remain to be repressed afterwards byfamine, or war.The tribes that possessed themselves of the more fruitful regions, though theymight win them and maintain them by continual battles, rapidly increased innumber and power, from the increased means of subsistence; till at length thewhole territory, from the confines of China to the shores of the Baltic, waspeopled by a various race of barbarians, brave, robust, and enterprising, enuredto hardships, and delighting in war.2[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_245] While the different fixedgovernments of Europe and Asia, by superior population and superior skill, wereable to oppose an impenetrable barrier to their destroying hordes, they wastedtheir superfluous numbers in contests with each other; but the moment that theweakness of the settled governments, or the casual union of many of thesewandering tribes, gave them the ascendant in power, the storm discharged itselfon the fairest provinces of the earth; and China, Persia, Egypt, and Italy, wereoverwhelmed at different periods in this flood of barbarism. These remarks arestrongly exemplified in the fall of the Roman empire. The shepherds of the northof Europe were long held in check by the vigour of the Roman arms, and theterror of the Roman name. The formidable irruption of the Cimbri in search ofnew settlements, though signalized by the destruction of five consular armies,was at length arrested in its victorious career by Marius; and the barbarianswere taught to repent their rashness by the almost complete extermination ofthis powerful colony.3 [20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1799] Thenames of Julius Cæsar, of Drusus, Tiberius, and Germanicus, impressed on theirminds by the slaughter of their countrymen, continued to inspire them with afear of encroaching on the Roman territory. But they were rather triumphed over,than vanquished;4 [20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_243] and thoughthe armies, or colonies, which they sent forth, were either cut off, or forcedback into their original seats, the vigour of the great German nation remainedunimpaired, and ready to pour forth her hardy sons in constant succession,wherever they could force an opening for themselves by their swords. The feeblereigns of Decius, Gallus, Æmilianus, Valerian, and Gallienus, afforded such anopening, and were in consequence marked by a general irruption of barbarians.The Goths, who were supposed to have migrated in the course of some years fromScandinavia to the Euxine, were bribed to withdraw their victorious troops, byan annual tribute. But no sooner was the dangerous secret of the wealth andweakness of the Roman empire thus revealed to the world, than new swarms ofbarbarians spread devastation through the frontier provinces, and terror as faras the gates of Rome.5 [20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_251] TheFranks, the Allemanni, the Goths, and adventurers of less considerable tribes,comprehended under these general appellations, poured like a torrent ondifferent parts of the empire. Rapine and oppression destroyed the produce ofthe present, and the hope of future harvests. A long and general famine wasfollowed by a wasting plague, which for fifteen years ravaged every city andprovince of the Roman empire; and, judging from the mortality in some spots, itwas conjectured, that in a few years, war, pestilence, and famine, had consumedthe moiety of the human species.6[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1801] Yet the tide of emigrationstill continued at intervals to roll impetuously from the north, and thesuccession of martial princes, who repaired the misfortunes of theirpredecessors, and propt the falling fate of the empire, had to accomplish thelabours of Hercules in freeing the Roman territory from these barbarousinvaders. The Goths, who, in the year 250, and the following years, ravaged theempire both by sea and land, with various success, but in the end, with thealmost total loss of their adventurous bands,7[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_249] in the year 269, sent out anemigration of immense numbers with their wives and families for the purposes ofsettlement.8 [20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1803] This formidablebody, which was said to consist at first of 320,000 barbarians,9[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1805] was ultimately destroyed anddispersed by the vigour and wisdom of the emperor Claudius. His successor,Aurelian, encountered and vanquished new hosts of the same name that had quittedtheir settlements in the Ukraine; but one of the implied conditions of thepeace, was, that he should withdraw the Roman forces from Dacia, and relinquishthis great province to the Goths and Vandals.10[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_247] A new and most formidableinvasion of the Allemanni threatened soon after to sack the mistress of theworld, and three great and bloody battles were fought by Aurelian before thisdestroying host could be exterminated, and Italy be delivered from itsravages.11 [20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_259]The strength of Aurelian had crushed on every side the enemies of Rome. Afterhis death, they seemed to revive with an increase of fury and numbers. They wereagain vanquished on all sides by the active vigour of Probus. The deliverance ofGaul alone from German invaders is reported to have cost the lives of fourhundred thousand barbarians.12 [20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1807]The victorious emperor pursued his successes into Germany itself, and theprinces of the country, astonished at his presence, and dismayed and exhaustedby the ill success of their last emigration, submitted to any terms that theconquerors might impose.13 [20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1809]Probus, and afterwards Diocletian,14[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_257] adopted the plan of recruitingthe exhausted provinces of the empire, by granting lands to the fugitive orcaptive barbarians, and disposing of their superfluous numbers where they mightbe the least likely to be dangerous to the state; but such colonizations were aninsufficient vent for the population of the north, and the ardent temper of thebarbarians would not always bend to the slow labours of agriculture.15[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1811] During the vigorous reign ofDiocletian, unable to make an effectual impression on the Roman frontiers, theGoths, the Vandals, the Gepidæ, the Burgundians, and the Allemanni, wasted eachother’s strength by mutual hostilities, while the subjects of the empire enjoyedthe bloody spectacle, conscious, that whoever vanquished, they vanquished theenemies of Rome.16 [20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_255]Under the reign of Constantine the Goths were again formidable. Their strengthhad been restored by a long peace, and a new generation had arisen, who nolonger remembered the misfortunes of ancient days.17[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1813] In two successive wars greatnumbers of them were slain. Vanquished on every side, they were driven into themountains; and, in the course of a severe campaign, above a hundred thousandwere computed to have perished by cold and hunger.18[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_253] Constantine adopted the plan ofProbus and his successors, in granting lands to those suppliant barbarians whowere expelled from their own country. Towards the end of his reign, a competentportion in the provinces of Pannonia, Thrace, Macedonia, and Italy, was assignedfor the habitation and subsistence of three hundred thousand Sarmatians.19[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1815]The warlike Julian had to encounter and vanquish new swarms of Franks andAllemanni, that, emigrating from their German forests during the civil wars ofConstantine, settled in different parts of Gaul, and made the scene of theirdevastations three times more extensive than that of their conquests.20[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_269] Destroyed and repulsed on everyside, they were pursued, in five expeditions, into their own country;21[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_267] but Julian had conquered, assoon as he had penetrated into Germany; and in the midst of that mighty hivewhich had sent out such swarms of people, as to keep the Roman world inperpetual dread, the principal obstacles to his progress were, almost impassableroads, and vast unpeopled forests.22[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_265]Though thus subdued and prostrated by the victorious arms of Julian, thishydra-headed monster rose again after a few years; and the firmness, vigilance,and powerful genius of Valentinian were fully called into action, in protectinghis dominions from the different irruptions of the Allemanni, the Burgundians,the Saxons, the Goths, the Quadi, and Sarmatians.23[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_263]The fate of Rome was at length determined by an irresistible emigration of theHuns from the east and north, which precipitated on the empire the whole body ofthe Goths;24 [20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1817] and thecontinuance of this powerful pressure on the nations of Germany, seemed toprompt them to the resolution, of abandoning to the fugitives of Sarmatia theirwoods and morasses, or at least, of discharging their superfluous numbers on theprovinces of the Roman empire.25[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1819] An emigration of four hundredthousand persons issued from the same coast of the Baltic, which had pouredforth the myriads of Cimbri and Teutones during the vigour of the Republic.26[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1821] When this host was destroyedby war and famine, other adventurers succeeded. The Suevi, the Vandals, theAlani, the Burgundians, passed the Rhine never more to retreat.27[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_261] The conquerors who firstsettled, were expelled or exterminated by new invaders. Clouds of barbariansseemed to collect from all parts of the northern hemisphere. Gathering freshdarkness and terror as they rolled on, the congregated bodies at length obscuredthe sun of Italy, and sunk the western world in night.In two centuries from the flight of the Goths across the Danube, barbarians ofvarious names and lineage had plundered and taken possession of Thrace,Pannonia, Gaul, Britain, Spain, Africa, and Italy.28[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1823] The most horribledevastations, and an incredible destruction of the human species, accompaniedthese rapid conquests; and famine and pestilence, which always march in thetrain of war, when it ravages with such inconsiderate cruelty, raged in everypart of Europe. The historians of the times, who beheld these scenes ofdesolation, labour, and are at a loss for expressions, to describe them; butbeyond the power of language, the numbers and the destructive violence of thesebarbarous invaders were evinced by the total change which took place in thestate of Europe.29 [20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_273] Thesetremendous effects, so long, and so deeply felt, throughout the fairest portionsof the earth, may be traced to the simple cause of the superiority of the powerof population to the means of subsistence.Machiavel, in the beginning of his history of Florence, says, “The people whoinhabit the northern parts that lie between the Rhine and the Danube, living ina healthful and prolific climate, often increase to such a degree, that vastnumbers of them are forced to leave their native country, and go in search ofnew habitations. When any one of those provinces begins to grow too populous,and wants to disburthen itself, the following method is observed. In the firstplace, it is divided into three parts, in each of which, there is an equalportion of the nobility and commonalty, the rich and the poor. After this theycast lots, and that division on which the lot falls, quits the country and goesto seek its fortune, leaving the other two more room and liberty to enjoy theirpossessions at home. These emigrations proved the destruction of the Romanempire.”30 [20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1825] Gibbon is ofopinion that Machiavel has represented these emigrations too much as regular andconcerted measures;31 [20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_271] but Ithink it highly probable that he has not erred much in this respect, and that itwas a foresight of the frequent necessity of thus discharging their redundantpopulation, which gave occasion to that law among the Germans, taken notice ofby Cæsar and Tacitus, of not permitting their cultivated lands to remain longerthan a year under the same possessors.32[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_281] The reasons which Cæsarmentions as being assigned for this custom, seem to be hardly adequate; but ifwe add to them, the prospect of emigration, in the manner described byMachiavel, the custom will appear to be highly useful, and a double weight willbe given to one of the reasons that Cæsar mentions, namely, lest they should beled, by being accustomed to one spot, to exchange the toils of war for thebusiness of agriculture.33 [20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_279]Gibbon very justly rejects, with Hume and Robertson, the improbable supposition,that the inhabitants of the north were far more numerous formerly, than atpresent;34 [20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1827] but he thinkshimself obliged at the same time to deny the strong tendency to increase in thenorthern nations,35 [20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1829] as if thetwo facts were necessarily connected. But a careful distinction should always bemade, between a redundant population, and a population actually great. TheHighlands of Scotland are probably more redundant in population than any otherpart of Great Britain; and though it would be admitting a palpable absurdity, toallow that the north of Europe, covered in early ages with immense forests, andinhabited by a race of people who supported themselves principally by theirherds and flocks,36 [20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_277] was morepopulous in those times than in its present state; yet the facts detailed in theDecline and Fall of the Roman empire, or even the very slight sketch of themthat I have given, cannot rationally be accounted for, without the suppositionof a most powerful tendency in these people to increase, and to repair theirrepeated losses by the prolific power of nature.From the first irruption of the Cimbri, to the final extinction of the westernempire, the efforts of the German nations to colonize or plunder wereunceasing.37 [20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_275] The numbers thatwere cut off during this period by war and famine were almost incalculable, andsuch as could not possibly have been supported with undiminished vigour by acountry thinly peopled, unless the stream had been supplied by a spring of veryextraordinary power.Gibbon describes the labours of Valentinian in securing the Gallic frontieragainst the Germans, an enemy, he says, whose strength was renewed by a streamof daring volunteers which incessantly flowed from the most distant tribes ofthe north.38 [20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1831] An easy adoptionof strangers was probably a mode by which some of the German nations renewedtheir strength so suddenly,39 [20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_285]after the most destructive defeats; but this explanation only removes thedifficulty a little further off. It makes the earth rest upon the tortoise; butdoes not tell us, on what the tortoise rests. We may still ask, what northernreservoir supplied this incessant stream of daring adventurers? Montesquieu’ssolution of the problem, will, I think, hardly be admitted. The swarms ofbarbarians which issued formerly from the north, appear no more, he says, atpresent; and the reason which he gives is, that the violences of the Romans haddriven the people of the south into the north. As long as this force continued,they remained there; but as soon as it was weakened, they spread themselvesagain over every country.The same phenomenon appeared after the conquests and tyrannies of Charlemagne,and the subsequent dissolution of his empire; and if a prince, he says, in thepresent days were to make similar ravages in Europe, the nations driven into thenorth, and resting on the limits of the universe,40[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_283] would there make a stand, tillthe moment when they would inundate, or conquer, Europe a third time. In a notehe observes, we see to what the famous question is reduced – why the north is nolonger so fully peopled as in former times?If the famous question, or rather the answer to it, be reduced to this, it isreduced to a miracle; for without some supernatural mode of obtaining food, howthese collected nations could support themselves in such barren regions, for solong a period, as during the vigour of the Roman empire, it is a littledifficult to conceive; and one can hardly help smiling at the bold figure ofthese prodigious crowds making their last determined stand on the limits of theuniverse, and living, as we must suppose, with the most patient fortitude on airand ice for some hundreds of years, till they could return to their own homes,and resume their usual more substantial mode of subsistence.The whole difficulty, however, is at once removed, if we apply to the Germannations at that time, a fact, which is so generally known to have occurred inAmerica, and suppose, that, when not checked by wars and famine, they increasedat a rate that would double their numbers in twenty-five or thirty years. Thepropriety, and even the necessity, of applying this rate of increase to theinhabitants of ancient Germany, will strikingly appear from that most valuablepicture of their manners which has been left us by Tacitus. He describes them asnot inhabiting cities, or even admitting of contiguous settlements. Every personsurrounds his house with a vacant space,41[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_289] a circumstance, which besidesits beneficial effect as a security from fire, is strongly calculated to preventthe generation, and check the ravages, of epidemics. They content themselvesalmost universally with one wife. Their matrimonial bond is strict and severe,and their manners in this respect deserving of the highest praise.42[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1833] They live in a state ofwell-guarded chastity, corrupted by no seducing spectacles, or convivialincitements. Adultery is extremely rare, and no indulgence is shewn to aprostitute. Neither beauty, youth, nor riches can procure her a husband; fornone there looks on vice with a smile, nor calls mutual seduction the way of theworld. To limit the increase of children, or put to death any of the husband’sblood, is accounted infamous; and virtuous manners have there more efficacy thangood laws elsewhere.43 [20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1835] Everymother suckles her own children, and does not deliver them into the hands ofservants and nurses. The youths partake late of the sexual intercourse, andhence pass the age of puberty unexhausted. Nor are the virgins brought forward.The same maturity, the same full growth is required: the sexes unite equallymatched and robust, and the children inherit the vigour of their parents. Themore numerous are a man’s kinsmen and relations, the more comfortable is his oldage; nor is it any advantage to be childless.44[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_287]With these manners, and a habit of enterprise and emigration, which wouldnaturally remove all fears about providing for a family, it is difficult toconceive a society with a stronger principle of increase in it; and we see atonce that prolific source of successive armies and colonies, against which, theforce of the Roman empire so long struggled with difficulty, and under which, itultimately sunk. It is not probable that for two periods together, or even forone, the population within the confines of Germany ever doubled itself intwenty-five years. Their perpetual wars, the rude state of agriculture, andparticularly the very strange custom adopted by most of the tribes, of markingtheir barriers by extensive desarts,45[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1837] would absolutely prevent anyvery great actual increase of numbers. At no one period could the country becalled well-peopled, though it was often redundant in population. They abandonedtheir immense forests to the exercise of hunting, employed in pasturage the mostconsiderable part of their lands, bestowed on the small remainder a rude andcareless cultivation, and when the return of famine severely admonished them ofthe insufficiency of their scanty resources, they accused the sterility of acountry which refused to supply the multitude of its inhabitants;46[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_293] but instead of clearing theirforests, draining their swamps, and rendering their soil fit to support anextended population, they found it more congenial to their martial habits andimpatient dispositions, to go “in quest of food, of plunder, or of glory,”47[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1839] into other countries. Theseadventurers either gained lands for themselves by their swords, or were cut offby the various accidents of war; were received into the Roman armies, ordispersed over the Roman territory; or perhaps, having relieved their country bytheir absence, returned home laden with spoils, and ready, after havingrecruited their diminished numbers, for fresh expeditions. The succession ofhuman beings appears to have been most rapid, and as fast as some were disposedof in colonies, or mowed down by the scythe of war and famine, others rose inincreased numbers to supply their place.According to this view of the subject, the North could never have beenexhausted; and when Dr. Robertson, describing the calamities of these invasions,says, that they did not cease, till the North, by pouring forth successiveswarms, was drained of people, and could no longer furnish instruments ofdestruction,48 [20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_291] he will appearto have fallen into the very error which he had before laboured to refute, andto speak as if the northern nations were actually very populous. For they musthave been so, if the number of their inhabitants at any one period, had beensufficient, besides the slaughter of war, to people in such a manner Thrace,Pannonia, Gaul, Spain, Africa, Italy, and England, as in some parts not to leavemany traces of their former inhabitants. The period of the peopling of thesecountries, however, he himself mentions as two hundred years,49[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1841] and in such a time newgenerations would arise that would more than supply every vacancy.The true cause which put a stop to the continuance of northern emigration wasthe impossibility any longer of making an impression on the most desirablecountries of Europe. They were then inhabited by the descendants of the bravestand most enterprising of the German tribes; and it was not probable, that theyshould so soon degenerate from the valour of their ancestors, as to suffer theirlands to be wrested from them by inferior numbers and inferior skill, thoughperhaps superior hardihood.Checked for a time by the bravery and poverty of their neighbours by land, theenterprising spirit and overflowing numbers of the Scandinavian nations soonfound vent by sea. Feared before the reign of Charlemagne, they were repelledwith difficulty by the care and vigour of that great prince, but during thedistractions of the empire under his feeble successors, they spread like adevouring flame over Lower Saxony, Friezeland, Holland, Flanders, and the banksof the Rhine as far as Mentz.After having long ravaged the coasts, they penetrated into the heart of France,pillaged and burnt her fairest towns, levied immense tributes on her monarchs,and at length obtained, by grant, one of the finest provinces of the kingdom.They made themselves even dreaded in Spain, Italy, and Greece, spreading everywhere desolation and terror. Sometimes they turned their arms against eachother, as if bent on their own mutual destruction; at other times transportedcolonies to unknown or uninhabited countries, as if they were willing to repair,in one place, the horrid destruction of the human race occasioned by theirfurious ravages, in others.50 [20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_297]The mal-administration and civil wars of the Saxon kings of England produced thesame effect as the weakness which followed the reign of Charlemagne in France,51[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1843] and for two hundred years theBritish isles were incessantly ravaged, and often in part subdued, by thesenorthern invaders. During the eighth, ninth, and tenth centuries, the sea wascovered with their vessels from one end of Europe to the other,52[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1845] and the countries, now themost powerful in arts and arms, were the prey of their constant depredations.The growing and consolidating strength of these countries, at length, removedall further prospect of success from such invasions.53[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_295] The nations of the north wereslowly and reluctantly compelled to confine themselves within their naturallimits, and to exchange their pastoral manners, and with them the peculiarfacilities of plunder and emigration which they afforded, for the patientlabours, and slow returns of trade and agriculture. But the slowness of thesereturns necessarily effected an important change in the manners of the people.In ancient Scandinavia, during the time of its constant wars and emigrations,few or none, probably, were ever deterred from marrying by the fear of not beingable to provide for a family. In modern Scandinavia, on the contrary, thefrequency of the marriage union is continually checked by the most imperious andjustly founded apprehensions of this kind. This is most particularly the case inNorway, as I shall have occasion to remark in another place; but the same fearsoperate in a greater or less degree, though every where with considerable force,in all parts of Europe. Happily, the more tranquil state of the modern worlddoes not demand such rapid supplies of human beings, and the prolific powers ofnature cannot therefore be so generally called into action.Mallet, in the excellent account of the northern nations which he has prefixedto his history of Denmark, observes, that he had not been able to discover anyproofs that their emigrations proceeded from want of room at home;54[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_301] and one of the reasons which hegives, is, that, after a great emigration, the countries often remained quitedeserted and unoccupied for a long time.55[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1847] But instances of this kind Iam inclined to think were rare, though they might occasionally happen. With thehabits of enterprize and emigration which prevailed in those days, a wholepeople would sometimes move in search of a more fertile territory. The lands,which they before occupied, must of necessity be desart for a time; and if therewere any thing particularly inelegible in the soil or situation, which the totalemigration of the people would seem to imply, it might be more congenial to thetemper of the surrounding barbarians, to provide for themselves better by theirswords, than to occupy immediately these rejected lands. Such total emigrationsproved the unwillingness of the society to divide, but by no means that theywere not straitened for room and food at home.The other reason which Mallet gives is, that, in Saxony, as well as Scandinavia,vast tracts of land lay in their original uncultivated state, having never beengrubbed up or cleared; and that, from the descriptions of Denmark in thosetimes, it appeared, that the coasts alone were peopled, but the interior partsformed one vast forest.56 [20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_299] It isevident, that he here falls into the common error of confounding a superfluityof inhabitants with great actual population. The pastoral manners of the people,and their habits of war and enterprize, prevented them from clearing andcultivating their lands;57 [20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1849] andthen these very forests, by restraining the sources of subsistence within verynarrow bounds, contributed to a superfluity of numbers, that is, to a populationbeyond what the scanty supplies of the country could support.There is another cause, not often attended to, why poor, cold, andthinly-peopled countries tend generally to a superfluity of inhabitants, and arestrongly prompted to emigration. In warmer and more populous countries,particularly those abounding in great towns and manufactures, an insufficientsupply of food can seldom continue long without producing epidemics, either inthe shape of great and ravaging plagues, or of less violent, though moreconstant, sicknesses. In poor, cold, and thinly-peopled countries, on thecontrary, from the antiseptic quality of the air, the misery arising frominsufficient or bad food, may continue a considerable time without producingthese effects, and, consequently, this powerful stimulus to emigration continuesto operate for a much longer period.58[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_303]I would by no means, however, be understood to say, that the northern nationsnever undertook any expeditions unless prompted by straitened food orcircumstances at home. Mallet relates, what was probably true, that it was theircommon custom to hold an assembly every spring, for the purpose of consideringin what quarter they should make war;59[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1851] and among a people whonourished so strong a passion for war, and who considered the right of thestrongest as a right divine, occasions for it would never be wanting. Besidesthis pure and disinterested love of war and enterprize, civil dissensions, thepressure of a victorious enemy, a wish for a milder climate, or other causes,might sometimes prompt to emigration; but, in a general view of the subject, Icannot help considering this period of history as affording a very strikingillustration of the principle of population; a principle, which appears to me,to have given the original impulse and spring of action, to have furnished theinexhaustible resources, and often prepared the immediate causes, of that rapidsuccession of adventurous irruptions and emigrations, which occasioned the fallof the Roman empire; and afterwards pouring from the thinly-peopled countries ofDenmark and Norway, for above two hundred years ravaged and over-ran a greatpart of Europe. Without the supposition of a tendency to increase almost asgreat as among the Americans, the facts appear to me not to be accounted for;60[20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_305] and with such a supposition, wecannot be at a loss to name the checks to the actual population, when we readthe disgusting details of those unceasing wars, and of that prodigal waste ofhuman life, which marked these barbarous periods.Inferior checks would undoubtedly concur; but we may safely pronounce, thatamong the shepherds of the north of Europe, war and famine, were the principalchecks that kept the population down to the level of their scanty means ofsubsistence.NOTES1 [20_VI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_240].

Jornandes de rebus Geticis, p. 83."},{"pageContent":"CHAP. VII.Of the Checks to Population among modern Pastoral Nations.THE pastoral tribes of Asia, by living in tents and moveable huts, instead offixed habitations, are still less connected with their territory than theshepherds of the north of Europe. The camp, and not the soil, is the nativecountry of the genuine Tartar. When the forage of a certain district isconsumed, the tribe makes a regular march to fresh pastures. In the summer, itadvances towards the north, in the winter returns again to the south; and thus,in a time of most profound peace, acquires the practical and familiar knowledgeof one of the most difficult operations of war. Such habits would strongly tendto diffuse among these wandering tribes the spirit of emigration and conquest.The thirst of rapine, the fear of a too powerful neighbour, or the inconvenienceof scanty pastures, have in all ages been sufficient causes to urge the hordesof Scythia boldly to advance into unknown countries, where they might hope tofind a more plentiful subsistence, or a less formidable enemy.1[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_307]In all their invasions, but more particularly when directed against thecivilized empires of the south, the Scythian shepherds have been uniformlyactuated by a most savage and destructive spirit. When the Moguls had subduedthe northern provinces of China, it was proposed, in calm and deliberatecouncil, to exterminate all the inhabitants of that populous country, that thevacant land might be converted to the pasture of cattle. The execution of thishorrid design was prevented by the wisdom and firmness of a Chinese mandarin;2[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1853] but the bare proposal of itexhibits a striking picture, not only of the inhuman manner, in which the rightsof conquest were abused, but of the powerful force of habit among nations ofshepherds, and the consequent difficulty of the transition from the pastoral tothe agricultural state.To pursue, even in the most cursory manner, the tide of emigration and conquestin Asia, the rapid increase of some tribes, and the total extinction of others,would lead much too far. During the periods of the formidable irruptions of theHuns, the wide-extended invasions of the Moguls, the sanguinary conquests ofTamerlane and Aurengzebe, and the dreadful convulsions which attended thedissolution, as well as the formation, of their empires, the checks topopulation are but too obvious. In reading of the devastations of the human racein those times, when the slightest motive of caprice or convenience, ofteninvolved a whole people in indiscriminate massacre,3[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_311] instead of looking for thecauses which prevented a further progress in population, we can only beastonished at the force of that principle of increase, which could furnish freshharvests of human beings for the scythe of each successive conqueror. Ourinquiries will be more usefully directed to the present state of the Tartarnations, and the ordinary checks to their increase, when not under the influenceof these violent convulsions.The immense country inhabited at present by those descendants of the Moguls andTartars, who retain nearly the same manners as their ancestors, comprises in italmost all the middle regions of Asia, and possesses the advantage of a veryfine and temperate climate. The soil is in general of great natural fertility.There are comparatively but few genuine deserts. The wide-extended plainswithout a shrub, which have sometimes received that appellation, and which theRussians call steppes, are covered with a luxuriant grass, admirably fitted forthe pasture of numerous herds and flocks. The principal defect of this extensivecountry is a want of water; but it is said that the parts which are suppliedwith this necessary article, would be sufficient for the support of four timesthe number of its present inhabitants, if it were properly cultivated.4[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1855] Every Orda, or tribe, has aparticular canton belonging to it, containing both its summer and winterpastures; and the population of this vast territory, whatever it may be, isprobably distributed over its surface nearly in proportion to the degree ofactual fertility in the different districts.Volney justly describes this necessary distribution in speaking of the Bedoweensof Syria: – “In the barren cantons, that is, those which are ill furnished withplants, the tribes are feeble, and very distant from each other; as in thedesert of Suez, that of the Red Sea, and the interior part of the Great Desert.When the soil is better covered, as between Damascus and the Euphrates, thetribes are stronger and less distant. And in the cultivable cantons, as thePachalic of Aleppo, the Hauran, and the country of Gaza, the incampments arenumerous and near each other.”5[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_309] Such a distribution ofinhabitants, according to the quantity of food which they can obtain in theactual state of their industry and habits, may be applied to Grand Tartary, aswell as to Syria and Arabia, and is, in fact, equally applicable to the wholeearth, though the commerce of civilized nations prevents it from being soobvious, as in the more simple stages of society.The Mahometan Tartars, who inhabit the western parts of Grand Tartary, cultivatesome of their lands; but this, in so slovenly and insufficient a manner, as notto afford a principal source of subsistence.6[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_317] The slothful and warlikegenius of the Barbarian every where prevails, and he does not easily reconcilehimself to the acquiring by labour what he can hope to acquire by rapine. Whenthe annals of Tartary are not marked by any signal wars and revolutions, itsdomestic peace and industry are constantly interrupted by petty contests, andmutual invasions for the sake of plunder. The Mahometan Tartars are said to livealmost entirely by robbing and preying upon their neighbours, as well in peaceas in war.7 [21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1857]The Usbecks, who possess as masters the kingdom of Chowarasm, leave to theirtributary subjects, the Sarts and Turkmans, the finest pastures of theircountry, merely, because their neighbours on that side are too poor, or toovigilant, to give them hopes of successful plunder. Rapine is their principalresource. They are perpetually making incursions into the territories of thePersians, and of the Usbecks of Great Bucharia; and neither peace nor truce canrestrain them; as the slaves, and other valuable effects, which they carry off,form the whole of their riches. The Usbecks, and their subjects the Turkmans,are perpetually at variance; and their jealousies, fomented often by the princesof the reigning house, keep the country in a constant state of intestinecommotion.8 [21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_315] The Turkmans arealways at war with the Curds and the Arabs, who often come and break the hornsof their herds, and carry away their wives and daughters.9The Usbecks of Great Bucharia are reckoned the most civilized of all theMahometan Tartars, yet are not much inferior to the rest in their spirit ofrapine.10 [21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1859] They are always atwar with the Persians, and laying waste the fine plains of the province ofChorasan. Though the country which they possess is of the greatest naturalfertility, and some of the remains of the ancient inhabitants practise thepeaceful arts of trade and agriculture; yet neither the aptitude of the soil,nor the example which they have before them, can induce them to change theirantient habits; and they would rather pillage, rob, and kill, their neighbours,than apply themselves to improve the benefits which nature so liberally offersthem.11 [21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_313]The Tartars of the Casatshia Orda in Turkestan, live in a state of continualwarfare with their neighbours to the north and east. In the winter they maketheir incursions towards the Kalmucks, who, about that time, go to scour thefrontiers of Great Bucharia, and the parts to the south of their country. On theother side, they perpetually incommode the Cosacks of the Yaik, the NogaiTartars, and the Kalmuck tribes which obey Ajuka Chan. In the summer they crossthe mountains of Eagles, and make inroads into Siberia. And though they areoften very ill treated in these incursions, and the whole of their plunder isnot equivalent to what they might obtain with very little labour from theirlands, yet they chuse rather to expose themselves to the thousand fatigues anddangers necessarily attendant on such a life, than apply themselves seriously toagriculture.12 [21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_321]The mode of life among the other tribes of Mahometan Tartars, presents the sameuniform picture, which it would be tiresome to repeat, and for which, therefore,I refer the reader to the Genealogical History of the Tartars, and its valuablenotes. The conduct of the author of this history himself, a Chan of Chowarasm,affords a curious example of the savage manner in which the wars, of policy, ofrevenge, or plunder, are carried on in these countries. His invasions of GreatBucharia were frequent, and each expedition was signalized by the ravage ofprovinces, and the utter ruin and destruction of towns and villages. When, atany time, the number of his prisoners impeded his motions, he made no scruple tokill them on the spot. Wishing to reduce the power of the Turkmans who weretributary to him, he invited all the principal people to a solemn feast, and hadthem massacred to the number of two thousand. He burnt and destroyed theirvillages with the most unsparing cruelty, and committed such devastations, thatthe effect of them returned on their authors, and the army of the victorssuffered severely from dearth.13[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1861]The Mahometan Tartars in general hate trade, and make it their business to spoilall the merchants who fall into their hands.14[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_319] The only commerce that iscountenanced is the commerce in slaves. These form a principal part of the bootywhich they carry off in their predatory incursions, and are considered as achief source of their riches. Those which they have occasion for themselves,either for the attendance on their herds, or as wives and concubines, they keep,and the rest they sell.15 [21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1863] TheCircassian and Daghestan Tartars, and the other tribes in the neighbourhood ofCaucasus, living in a poor and mountainous country, and, on that account, lesssubject to invasion, generally overflow with inhabitants; and when they cannotobtain slaves in the common way, steal from one another, and even sell their ownwives and children.16 [21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_331] Thistrade in slaves, so general among the Mahometan Tartars, may be one of thecauses of their constant wars; as, when a prospect of a plentiful supply forthis kind of traffick offers itself, neither peace nor alliance can restrainthem.17 [21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_329]The heathen Tartars, the Kalmucks, and Moguls, do not make much use of slaves,and are said, in general, to lead a much more peaceable and harmless life,contenting themselves with the produce of their herds and flocks, which formtheir sole riches. They rarely make war for the sake of plunder; and seldominvade the territory of their neighbours, unless to revenge a prior attack. Theyare not, however, without destructive wars. The inroads of the Mahometan Tartarsoblige them to constant defence and retaliation; and feuds subsist between thekindred tribes of the Kalmucks and Moguls, which, fomented by the artful policyof the emperor of China, are carried on with such animosity, as to threaten theentire destruction of one or other of these nations.18[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_327]The Bedoweens of Arabia and Syria do not live in greater tranquillity than theinhabitants of Grand Tartary. The very nature of the pastoral state, seems tofurnish perpetual occasions for war. The pastures which a tribe uses at oneperiod, form but a small part of its possessions. A large range of territory issuccessively occupied in the course of the year; and as the whole of this isabsolutely necessary for the annual subsistence of the tribe, and is consideredas appropriated, every violation of it, though the tribe may be at a greatdistance, is held to be a just cause of war.19[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_325] Alliances and kindred makethese wars more general. When blood is shed, more must expiate it; and as suchaccidents have multiplied in the lapse of years, the greatest part of the tribeshave quarrels between them, and live in a state of perpetual hostility.20[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_323] In the times which precededMahomet, seventeen hundred battles are recorded by tradition; and a partialtruce of two months, which was religiously kept, might be considered, accordingto a just remark of Gibbon, as still more strongly expressive of their generalhabits of anarchy and warfare.21[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_335]The waste of life, from such habits, might alone appear sufficient to represstheir population; but probably their effect is still greater in the fatal checkwhich they give to every species of industry, and particularly to that, theobject of which is to enlarge the means of subsistence. Even the construction ofa well, or a reservoir of water, requires some funds and labour in advance; andwar may destroy in one day, the work of many months, and the resources of awhole year.22 [21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1865] The evils seemmutually to produce each other. A scarcity of subsistence might at first perhapsgive occasion to the habits of war, and the habits of war in return powerfullycontribute to narrow the means of subsistence.Some tribes, from the nature of the deserts in which they live, seem to benecessarily condemned to a pastoral life;23[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_333] but even those which inhabitsoils proper for agriculture, have but little temptation to practise this art,while surrounded by marauding neighbours. The peasants of the frontier provincesof Syria, Persia, and Siberia, exposed as they are to the constant incursions ofa devastating enemy, do not lead a life that is to be envied by the wanderingTartar or Arab. A certain degree of security, is perhaps still more necessary,than richness of soil, to encourage the change from the pastoral to theagricultural state; and where this cannot be attained, the sedentary labourer ismore exposed to the vicissitudes of fortune, than he who leads a wandering life,and carries all his property with him.24[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1867] Under the feeble, yetoppressive government of the Turks, it is not uncommon for peasants to deserttheir villages and betake themselves to a pastoral state, in which they expectto be better able to escape from the plunder of their Turkish masters and Arabneighbours.25 [21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1869]It may be said, however, of the shepherd, as of the hunter, that if want alonecould effect a change of habits, there would be few pastoral tribes remaining.Notwithstanding the constant wars of the Bedoween Arabs, and the other checks totheir increase, from the hardships of their mode of life, their populationpresses so hard against the limits of their food, that they are compelled fromnecessity to a degree of abstinence, which nothing but early and constant habitcould enable the human constitution to support. According to Volney, the lowerclasses of the Arabs live in a state of habitual misery and famine.26[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_341] The tribes of the desert denythat the religion of Mahomet was made for them. For how, they say, can weperform ablutions, when we have no water; how can we give alms, when we have noriches; or what occasion can there be to fast during the month of Ramadan, whenwe fast all the year?27 [21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_339]The power and riches of a Chaik consist in the number of his tribe. He considersit therefore as his interest to encourage population, without reflecting how itmaybe supported. His own consequence much depends on a numerous progeny, andkindred;28 [21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1871] and in a state ofsociety where power generally procures subsistence, each individual familyderives strength and importance from its numbers. These ideas act strongly as abounty upon population, and co-operating with a spirit of generosity whichalmost produces a community of goods,29[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1873] contribute to push it to itsutmost verge, and to depress the body of the people in the most rigid poverty.The habits of polygamy, where there have been losses of men in war, tend perhapsalso to produce the same effect. Niehbuhr observes that polygamy multipliesfamilies till many of their branches sink into the most wretched misery.30[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_337] The descendants of Mahomet arefound in great numbers all over the east, and many of them in extreme poverty. AMahometan is in some degree obliged to polygamy from a principle of obedience tohis prophet, who makes one of the great duties of man to consist in procreatingchildren to glorify the Creator. Fortunately, individual interest, corrects insome degree, as in many other instances, the absurdity of the legislator, andthe poor Arab is obliged to proportion his religious obedience to the scantinessof his resources. Yet still the direct encouragements to population areextraordinarily great; and nothing can place, in a more striking point of view,the futility and absurdity of such encouragements, than the present state ofthese countries. It is universally agreed, that if their population be not lessthan formerly, it is indubitably not greater; and it follows as a directconsequence, that the great increase of some families has absolutely pushed theothers out of existence. Gibbon, speaking of Arabia, observes, that “The measureof population is regulated by the means of subsistence, and the inhabitants ofthis vast peninsula, might be out-numbered by the subjects of a fertile andindustrious province.”31 [21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_347]Whatever may be the encouragements to marriage, this measure cannot be passed.While the Arabs retain their present manners, and the country remains in itspresent state of cultivation, the promise of Paradise to every man who had tenchildren, would but little increase their numbers, though it might greatlyincrease their misery. Direct encouragements to population have no tendencywhatever to change these manners, and promote cultivation. Perhaps, indeed, theyhave a contrary tendency, as the constant uneasiness from poverty and want whichthey occasion, would encourage the marauding spirit32[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_345] and multiply the occasions ofwar.Among the Tartars, who, from living in a more fertile soil, are comparativelyricher in cattle, the plunder to be obtained in predatory incursions, is greaterthan among the Arabs. And as the contests are more bloody, from the superiorstrength of the tribes, and the custom of making slaves is general, the loss ofnumbers in war will be more considerable. These two circumstances united, enablesome hordes of fortunate robbers to live in a state of plenty, in comparison oftheir less enterprising neighbours. Professor Pallas gives a particular accountof two wandering tribes subject to Russia, one of which supports itself almostentirely by plunder, and the other lives as peacefully as the restlessness ofits neighbours will admit. It may be curious to trace the different checks topopulation that result from these different habits.The Kirgisiens, according to Pallas,33[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_343] live at their ease incomparison of the other wandering tribes that are subject to Russia. The spiritof liberty and independence which reigns amongst them, joined to the facilitywith which they can procure a flock sufficient for their maintenance, preventsany of them from entering into the service of others. They all expect to betreated as brothers, and the rich, therefore, are obliged to use slaves. It maybe asked what are the causes which prevent the lower classes of people fromincreasing till they become poor?Pallas has not informed us how far vicious customs with respect to women, or therestraints on marriage from the fear of a family, may have contributed to thiseffect; but, perhaps, the description which he gives of their civilconstitution, and licentious spirit of rapine, may be alone almost sufficient toaccount for it. The Chan cannot exercise his authority but through the medium ofa council of principal persons, chosen by the people; and even the decrees thusconfirmed are continually violated with impunity.34[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_355] Though the plunder and captureof persons, of cattle, and of merchandize, which the Kirgisiens exercise ontheir neighbours the Kazalpacs, the Bucharians, the Persians, the Truchemenes,the Kalmucks, and the Russians, are prohibited by their laws, yet no person isafraid to avow them. On the contrary, they boast of their successes in this way,as of the most honourable enterprizes. Sometimes they pass their frontiersalone, to seek their fortune, sometimes collect in troops under the command ofan able chief, and pillage entire caravans. A great number of Kirgisiens, inexercising this rapine, are either killed, or taken into slavery; but about thisthe nation troubles itself very little. When these ravages are committed byprivate adventurers, each retains what he has taken, whether cattle or women.The male slaves and the merchandize are sold to the rich, or to foreigntraders.35 [21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1875]With these habits, in addition to their national wars, which, from the fickleand turbulent disposition of the tribe, are extremely frequent,36[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_353] we may easily conceive thatthe checks to population from violent causes may be so powerful as nearly topreclude all others. Occasional famines may sometimes attack them in their warsof devastation,37 [21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_351] theirfatiguing predatory incursions, or from long droughts, and mortality of cattle;but, in the common course of things, the approach of poverty would be the signalfor a new marauding expedition; and the poor Kirgisien would either return withsufficient to support him, or lose his life or liberty in the attempt. He whodetermines to be rich, or die, and does not scruple the means, cannot longremain poor.The Kalmucks, who, before their migration in 1771, inhabited the fertile steppesof the Wolga, under the protection of Russia, lived, in general, in a differentmanner. They were not often engaged in any very bloody wars;38[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_349] and the power of the Chanbeing absolute;39 [21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_361] and thecivil administration better regulated than among the Kirgisiens, the maraudingexpeditions of private adventurers were checked. The Kalmuck women are extremelyprolific. Barren marriages are rare, and three or four children are generallyseen playing round every hut. From which it may naturally be concluded, Pallasobserves, that they ought to have multiplied greatly during the hundred andfifty years that they inhabited tranquilly the steppe of the Wolga. The reasonswhich he gives for their not having increased so much as might be expected, are,the many accidents occasioned by falls from horses, the frequent petty warsbetween their different princes, and with their different neighbours; and,particularly, the numbers among the poorer classes who die of hunger, of misery,and every species of calamity, of which the children are most frequently thevictims.40 [21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1877]It appears that when this tribe first put itself under the protection of Russia,it had separated from the Soongares, and was by no means numerous. Thepossession of the fertile steppe of the Wolga, and a more tranquil life, soonincreased it, and in 1662 it amounted to fifty thousand families.41[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_359] From this period to 1771, thetime of its migration, it seems to have increased very slowly. The extent ofpastures possessed, would not probably admit of a much greater population, as atthe time of its flight from these quarters, the irritation of the Chan at theconduct of Russia, was seconded by the complaints of the people, of the want ofpasture for their numerous herds. At this time the tribe amounted to between 55and 60,000 families. Its fate in this curious migration, was what has probablybeen the fate of many other wandering hordes, who, from scanty pastures, orother causes of discontent, have attempted to seek for fresh seats. The marchtook place in the winter, and numbers perished on this painful journey fromcold, famine, and misery. A great part was either killed or taken by theKirghises; and those who reached their place of destination, though received atfirst kindly by the Chinese, were afterwards treated with extreme severity.42[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_357]Before this migration, the lower classes of the Kalmucks had lived in greatpoverty and wretchedness, and had been reduced habitually to make use of everyanimal, plant, or root, from which it was possible to extract nourishment.43[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_365] They very seldom killed any oftheir cattle that were in health, except indeed they were stolen, and then theywere devoured immediately for fear of a discovery. Wounded, or worn out horses,and beasts that had died of any disease, except a contagious epidemic, wereconsidered as most desireable food. Some of the poorest Kalmucks would eat themost putrid carrion, and even the dung of their cattle.44[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1879] A great number of childrenperished of course from bad nourishment.45[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1881] In the winter all the lowerclasses suffered severely from cold and hunger.46[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_363] In general, one third of theirsheep, and often much more, died in the winter, in spite of all their care; andif a frost came late in the season after rain and show, so that the cattle couldnot get at the grass, the mortality among their herds became general, and thepoorer classes of the Kalmucks were exposed to inevitable famine.47[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1883]Malignant fevers, generated principally by their putrid food and the putridexhalations with which they were surrounded, and the small-pox, which is dreadedlike the plague, sometimes thinned their numbers;48[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1885] but in general, it appears,that their population pressed so hard against the limits of their means ofsubsistence, that want, with the diseases arising from it, might be consideredas the principal check to their increase.A person travelling in Tartary during the summer months, would probably seeextensive steppes unoccupied, and grass in profusion, spoiling for want ofcattle to consume it. He would infer, perhaps, that the country could support amuch greater number of inhabitants, even supposing them to remain in theirshepherd state. But this might be a hasty and unwarranted conclusion. A horse,or any other working animal, is said to be strong only in proportion to thestrength of his weakest part. If his legs be slender and feeble, the strength ofhis body will be but of little consequence; or if he wants power in his back andhaunches, the strength which he may possess in his limbs can never be calledfully into action. The same reasoning must be applied to the power of the earthto support living creatures. The profusion of nourishment which is poured forthin the seasons of plenty, cannot all be consumed by the scanty numbers that wereable to subsist through the season of scarcity. When human industry andforesight are directed in the best manner, the population that the soil cansupport is regulated by the average produce throughout the year; but amonganimals, and in the uncivilized states of man, it will be much below thisaverage. The Tartar would find it extremely difficult to collect and carry withhim such a quantity of hay, as would feed all his cattle well during the winter.It would impede his motions, expose him to the attacks of his enemies, and anunfortunate day might deprive him of the labours of a whole summer, as in themutual invasions which occur, it seems to be the universal practice to burn anddestroy all the forage and provisions which cannot be carried away.49[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_375] The Tartar, therefore,provides only for the most valuable of his cattle during the winter, and leavesthe rest to support themselves by the scanty herbage which they can pick up.This poor living, combined with the severe cold, naturally destroys aconsiderable part of them.50 [21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_373]The population of the tribe is measured by the population of its herds; and theaverage numbers of the Tartars, as of the horses that run wild in the desart,are repressed so low by the annual returns of the cold and scarcity of winter,that they cannot consume all the plentiful offerings of summer.Droughts and unfavourable seasons have, in proportion to their frequency, thesame effect as the winter. In Arabia,51[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1887] and a great part ofTartary,52 [21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_371] droughts are notuncommon; and if the periods of their return be not above six or eight years,the average population can never much exceed what the soil can support duringthese unfavourable times. This is true in every situation; but perhaps in theshepherd state, man is peculiarly exposed to be affected by the seasons; and agreat mortality of parent stock is an evil more fatal and longer felt, than thefailure of a crop of grain. Pallas and the other Russian travellers speak ofepizooties, as very common in these parts of the world.53[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_369]As among the Tartars, a family is always honourable, and women are reckoned veryserviceable in the management of the cattle and the household concerns, it isnot probable that many are deterred from marriage, from the fear of not beingable to support a family.54 [21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_367] Atthe same time, as all wives are bought of their parents, it must sometimes beout of the power of the poorer classes to make the purchase. The monk Rubruquis,speaking of this custom, says, that as parents keep all their daughters tillthey can sell them, their maids are sometimes very stale before they aremarried.55 [21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_381] Among the MahometanTartars female captives would supply the place of wives;56[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1889] but among the pagan Tartars,who make but little use of slaves, the inability of buying a wife, mustfrequently operate on the poorer classes as a check to marriage, particularly astheir price would be kept up by the practice of polygamy among the rich.57[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_379]The Kalmucks are said not to be jealous,58[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_377] and, from the generalprevalence of the venereal disease among them,59[21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1891] we may infer that a certaindegree of promiscuous intercourse prevails.On the whole, therefore, it would appear, that in that department of theshepherd life which has been considered in this chapter, the principal checkswhich keep the population down to the level of the means of subsistence, are,restraint, from inability to obtain a wife, vicious customs with respect towomen, epidemics, wars, famine, and the diseases arising from extreme poverty.The three first checks and the last appear to have operated with much less forceamong the shepherds of the north of Europe.NOTES1 [21_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_306].

VIII.Of the Checks to Population in different Parts of Africa.THE parts of Africa visited by Park, are described by him as neither wellcultivated, nor well peopled. He found many extensive and beautiful districtsentirely destitute of inhabitants; and in general, the borders of the differentkingdoms were either very thinly peopled, or perfectly deserted. The swampybanks of the Gambia, the Senegal, and other rivers towards the coast, appearedto be unfavourable to population, from being unhealthy;1[22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_385] but other parts were not ofthis description; and it was not possible, he says, to behold the wonderfulfertility of the soil, the vast herds of cattle proper both for labour and food,and reflect on the means which presented themselves of vast inland navigation,without lamenting that a country so abundantly gifted by nature, should remainin its present savage and neglected state.2[22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_1893]The causes of this neglected state clearly appear, however, in the descriptionwhich Park gives of the general habits of the negroe nations. In a countrydivided into a thousand petty states, mostly independent and jealous of eachother, it is natural to imagine, he says, that wars frequently originate fromvery frivolous provocations. The wars of Africa are of two kinds, one calledkilli, that which is openly avowed; and the other, tegria, plundering orstealing. These latter are very common, particularly about the beginning of thedry season, when the labours of harvest are over, and provisions are plentiful.These plundering excursions always produce speedy retaliation.3[22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_383]The insecurity of property arising from this constant exposure to plunder, mustnecessarily have a most baneful effect on industry. The deserted state of allthe frontier provinces, sufficiently proves to what a degree it operates. Thenature of the climate is unfavourable to the exertion of the negroe nations;and, as there are not many opportunities of turning to advantage the surplusproduce of their labour, we cannot be surprised that they should in generalcontent themselves with cultivating only as much ground as is necessary fortheir own support.4 [22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_1895] Thesecauses appear adequately to account for the uncultivated state of the country.The waste of life in these constant wars and predatory incursions must beconsiderable; and Park agrees with Buffon in stating, that, independent ofviolent causes, longevity is rare among the negroes. At forty, he says, most ofthem became greyhaired and covered with wrinkles, and but few of them survivethe age of fifty-five, or sixty.5[22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_393] Buffon attributes thisshortness of life to the premature intercourse of the sexes, and the very earlyand excessive debauchery.6 [22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_391] Onthis subject perhaps he has been led into exaggerations; but, withoutattributing too much to this cause, it seems agreeable to the analogy of natureto suppose, that, as the natives of hot climates arrive much earlier at maturitythan the inhabitants of colder countries, they should also perish earlier.According to Buffon, the negroe women are extremely prolific; but, it appearsfrom Park, that they are in the habit of suckling their children two or threeyears, and as the husband, during this time, devotes the whole of his attentionto his other wives, the family of each wife is seldom numerous.7[22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_389] Polygamy is universallyallowed among the negro nations,8[22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_387] and consequently without agreater superabundance of women than we have reason to suppose, many will beobliged to live unmarried. This hardship will probably fall principally on theslaves, who, according to Park, are in the proportion of three to one to thefree men.9 [22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_1897] A master is notpermitted to sell his domestic slaves, nor those born in his own house, exceptin case of famine, to support himself and family. We may imagine, therefore,that he will not suffer them to increase beyond the employment which he has forthem. The slaves which are purchased, or the prisoners taken in war, areentirely at the disposal of their masters.10[22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_1899] They are often treated withextreme severity, and in any scarcity of women arising from the polygamy of thefree men, would of course be deprived of them without scruple. Few or no women,probably, remain in a state of strict celibacy; but, in proportion 12 the numbermarried, the state of society does not seem to be favourable to increase.Africa has been at all times the principal mart of slaves. The drains of itspopulation in this way have been great and constant, particularly since theirintroduction into the European colonies; but perhaps, as Dr. Franklin observes,it would be difficult to find the gap that has been made by a hundred yearsexportation of negroes which has blackened half America.11[22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_399] For, notwithstanding thisconstant emigration, the loss of numbers from incessant war, and the checks toincrease from vice and other causes, it appears, that the population iscontinually passing beyond the means of subsistence. According to Park, scarceyears and famines are frequent. Among the four principal causes of slavery inAfrica, he mentions famine next to war;12[22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_1901] and the express permissiongiven to masters to sell their domestic slaves for the support of their family,which they are not allowed to do on any less urgent occasion,13[22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_397] seems to imply the notinfrequent recurrence of severe want. During a great scarcity, which lasted forthree years in the countries of the Gambia, great numbers of people becameslaves. Park was assured by Dr. Laidley, that at that time many free-men came,and begged with great earnestness, to be put upon his slave chain to save themfrom perishing with hunger.14 [22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_1903]While Park was in Manding, a scarcity of provisions was severely felt by thepoor, as the following circumstance painfully convinced him. Every eveningduring his stay, he observed five or six women come to the Mansa’s house, andreceive each of them a certain quantity of corn. “Observe that boy,” said theMansa to him, pointing to a fine child about five years of age – “his mother hassold him to me for forty days provision for herself and the rest of her family.I have bought another boy in the same manner.”15[22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_1905] In Sooseeta, a small Jallonkavillage, Mr. Park was informed by the master, that he could furnish noprovisions, as there had lately been a great scarcity in that part of thecountry. He assured him, that before they had gathered in their present crops,all the inhabitants of Kullo had been for twenty-nine days without tasting corn;during which time they had supported themselves entirely on the yellow powderwhich is found in the pods of the nitta, so called by the natives, a specles ofmimosa, and upon the seeds of the bamboo cane, which, when properly pounded anddressed, taste very much like rice.16[22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_395]It may be said, perhaps, that as, according to Park’s account, much good landremains uncultivated in Africa, the dearths may be attributed to a want ofpeople; but if this were the case, we can hardly suppose that such numbers wouldyearly be sent out of the country. What the negroe nations really want, is,security of property, and its general concomitant, industry; and without these,an increase of people would only greatly aggravate their distresses. If, inorder to fill up those parts that appeared to be deficient in inhabitants, wewere to suppose a high bounty given on children, the effects would probably be,the increase of wars, the increase of the exportation of slaves, and a greatincrease of misery, but little or no real increase of population.The customs of some nations, and the prejudices of all, operate in some degreelike a bounty of this kind. The Shangalla negroes, according to Bruce, hemmed inon every side by active and powerful enemies, and leading a life of severelabour, and of constant apprehension, feel but little desire for women. It isthe wife and not the man, that is the cause of their polygamy. Though they livein separate tribes or nations, yet these nations are again subdivided intofamilies. In fighting, each family attacks and defends by itself, and their’s isthe spoil and plunder who take it. The mothers, therefore, sensible of thedisadvantages of a small family, seek to multiply it by all the means in theirpower; and it is by their importunity, that the husband suffers himself to beovercome.17 [22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_403] The motives topolygamy among the Galla, are described to be the same, and in both nations, thefirst wife courts the alliance of a second, for her husband; and the principalargument that she makes use of, is, that their families may be joined togetherand be strong, and that her children, by being few in number, may not fall aprey to their enemies in the day of battle.18[22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_401] It is highly probable thatthis extreme desire of having large families, defeats its own purpose; and thatthe poverty and misery which it occasions, cause fewer children to grow up tomaturity than if the parents had confined their attention to the rearing of asmaller number.Bruce is a great friend to polygamy, and defends it in the only way in which itis capable of being defended, by asserting, that, in the countries in which itprincipally prevails, the proportion of girls to boys born, is two or three toone. A fact so extraordinary, however, cannot be admitted upon the authority ofthose vague inquiries on which he founds his opinion. That there areconsiderably more women living, than men, in these climates, is in the highestdegree probable. Even in Europe, where it is known with certainty that more boysare born than girls, the women in general exceed the men in number; and we mayimagine, that, in hot and unhealthy climates, and in a barbarous state ofsociety, the accidents to which the men are exposed must be very greatlyincreased. The women by leading a more sedentary life, would suffer less fromthe effects of a scorching sun and swampy exhalations. They would in general bemore exempt from the disorders arising from debauchery; but above all, theywould escape in great measure the ravages of war. In a state of society in whichhostilities never cease, the drains of men, from this cause alone, must occasiona great disproportion of the sexes, particularly where it is the custom, asrelated of the Galla in Abyssinia,19[22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_407] to massacre indiscriminatelyall the males, and save only the marriageable women from the generaldestruction. The actual disproportion of the sexes arising from these causes,probably, first gave rise to the permission of polygamy, and has, perhaps,contributed to make us more easily believe, that the proportion of male andfemale children, in hot climates, is very different from what we haveexperienced it to be, in the temperate zone.Bruce, with the usual prejudices on this subject, seems to think that thecelibacy of a part of the women is fatal to the population of a country. Heobserves of Jidda, that, on account of the great scarcity of provisions which isthe result of an extraordinary concourse of people to a place almost destituteof the necessaries of life, few of the inhabitants can avail themselves of theprivilege granted by Mahomet. They cannot, therefore, marry more than one wife;and from this cause arises, he says, the want of people and the large number ofunmarried women.20 [22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_1907] But it isevident, that the want of people in this barren spot arises solely from the wantof provisions, and that if each man had half a dozen wives, the number of peoplecould not be much increased by it.In Arabia Felix, according to Bruce, where every sort of provision isexceedingly cheap, where the fruits of the ground, the general food of man, areproduced spontaneously, the support of a number of wives costs no more than thatof so many slaves or servants; their food is the same, and a blue cotton shirt,a habit common to them all, is not more chargeable for the one than for theother. The consequence is, he says, that celibacy in women is prevented, and thenumber of people increased in a fourfold ratio by polygamy, to what it is inthose countries that are monogamous.21[22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_405] And yet, notwithstanding thisfourfold increase, it does not appear that any part of Arabia is really verypopulous.The effect of polygamy in increasing the number of married women and preventingcelibacy, is beyond dispute; but how far this may tend to increase the actualpopulation, is a very different consideration. It may perhaps contribute topress the population harder against the limits of the food; but the squalid andhopeless poverty which this occasions, is by no means favourable to industry;and in a climate in which there appears to be many predisposing causes ofsickness, it is difficult to conceive that this state of wretchedness does notpowerfully contribute to the extraordinary mortality which has been observed insome of these countries.According to Bruce, the whole coast of the Red Sea, from Suez to Babelmandel, isextremely unwholesome, but more especially between the tropics. Violent fevers,called there nedad, make the principal figure in this fatal list, and generallyterminate the third day in death.22[22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_415] Fear frequently seizesstrangers upon the first sight of the great mortality which they observe ontheir first arrival.Jidda and all the parts of Arabia adjacent to the eastern coast of the Red Sea,are in the same manner very unwholesome.23[22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_1909]In Gondar, fevers perpetually reign, and the inhabitants are all the colour of acorpse.24 [22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_1911]In Sirè, one of the finest countries in the world, putrid fevers of the veryworst kind are almost constant.25[22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_413] In the low grounds ofAbyssinia, in general, malignant tertians occasion a great mortality.26[22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_1913] And every where, thesmall-pox makes great ravages, particularly among the nations bordering onAbyssinia, where it sometimes extinguishes whole tribes.27[22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_411]The effect of poverty, bad diet, and its almost constant concomitant want ofcleanliness, in aggravating malignant distempers, is well known; and this kindof wretchedness seems generally to prevail. Of Tchagassa, near Gondar, Bruceobserves, that the inhabitants, notwithstanding their threefold harvests, aremiserably poor.28 [22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_409] At Adowa,the capital of Tigré, he makes the same remark, and applies it to all theAbyssinian farmers. The land is let yearly to the highest bidder, and, ingeneral, the landlord furnishes the seed on condition to receive half of theproduce; but, it is said, that he is a very indulgent master who does not takeanother quarter for the risk he has run; so that the quantity which comes to theshare of the husbandman is not more than sufficient to afford a bare sustenanceto his wretched family.29 [22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_423] TheAgows, one of the most considerable nations of Abyssinia in point of number, aredescribed by Bruce as living in a state of misery and penury scarcely to beconceived. We saw a number of women, he says, wrinkled and sunburnt, so asscarcely to appear human, wandering about under a burning sun, with one andsometimes two children upon their backs, gathering the seeds of bent grass tomake a kind of bread.30 [22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_1915] TheAgow women begin to bear children at eleven years old. They marry generallyabout that age, and there is no such thing as barrenness known among them.31[22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_1917] In Dixan, one of the frontiertowns of Abyssinia, the only trade is that of selling children. Five hundred areexported annually to Arabia; and in times of scarcity, Bruce observes, fourtimes that number.32 [22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_421]In Abyssinia, polygamy does not regularly prevail. Bruce, indeed, makes rather astrange assertion on this subject, and says, that though we read from theJesuits a great deal about marriage and polygamy, yet that there is nothingwhich may be averred more truly, than that there is no such thing as marriage inAbyssinia.33 [22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_1919] But, howeverthis may be, it appears clear, that few or no women live a life of celibacy inAbyssinia, and that the prolific powers of nature are nearly all called intoaction, except as far as they are checked by promiscuous intercourse. This,however, from the state of manners described by Bruce, must operate verypowerfully.34 [22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_1921]The check to population from war, appears to be excessive. For the last fourhundred years, according to Bruce, it has never ceased to lay desolate thisunhappy country;35 [22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_419] and thesavage manner in which it is carried on, surrounds it with tenfold destruction.When Bruce first entered Abyssinia, he saw on every side ruined villagesdestroyed to the lowest foundation, by Rass Michael in his march to Gondar.36[22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_1923] In the course of the civilwars, while Bruce was in the country, he says, “The rebels had begun to laywaste Dembea, and burnt all the villages in the plain, from south to west;making it like a desert between Michael and Fasil.**** The king often ascendedto the top of the tower of his palace, and contemplated, with the greatestdispleasure, the burning of his rich villages in Dembea.”37[22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_417] In another place, he says, thewhole country of Degwessa was totally destroyed; men, women, and children, wereentirely extirpated, without distinction of age or sex; the houses rased to theground, and the country about it left as desolate as after the deluge. Thevillages belonging to the king were as severely treated; a universal cry washeard from all parts, but no one dared to suggest any means of help.”38[22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_427] In Maitsha, one of theprovinces of Abyssinia, he was told, that if ever he met an old man, he might besure that he was a stranger, as all that were natives died by the lance young.39[22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_1925]If the picture of the state of Abyssinia, drawn by Bruce, be in any degree nearthe truth, it places, in a strong point of view, the force of that principle ofincrease which preserves a population fully up to the level of the means ofsubsistence, under the checks of war, pestilential diseases, and promiscuousintercourse, all operating in an excessive degree.The nations which border on Abyssinia are universally short-lived. A Shangallawoman at twenty-two, is, according to Bruce, more wrinkled and deformed by agethan is an European woman at sixty.40[22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_1927] It would appear therefore,that, in all these countries, as among the northern shepherds, in the times oftheir constant emigrations, there is a very rapid succession of human beings,and the difference in the two instances is, that our northern ancestors died outof their own country, whereas these die at home. If accurate registers ofmortality were kept among these nations, I have little doubt that it wouldappear, that, including the mortality from wars, 1 in 17 or 18 at the least, dieannually, instead of 1 in 34 or 36, as in the generality of European states.The description which Bruce gives of some parts of the country which he passedthrough on his return home, presents a picture more dreadful even than the stateof Abyssinia, and shews how little population depends on the birth of children,in comparison of the production of food, and of those circumstances of naturaland political situation which influence this produce.“At half past six,” Bruce says, “we arrived at Garigana, a village whoseinhabitants had all perished with hunger the year before; their wretched bonesbeing all unburied, and scattered upon the surface of the ground where thevillage formerly stood. We encamped among the bones of the dead, no space couldbe found free from them.”41 [22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_425]Of another town or village in his route, he observes, “The strength of Teawa was25 horse. The rest of the inhabitants might be 1200, naked, miserable, anddespicable Arabs, like the rest of those which live in villages.****Such was thestate of Teawa. Its consequence was only to remain till the Daveina Arabs shouldresolve to attack it, when its corn-fields being burnt and destroyed in a night,by a multitude of horsemen, the bones of its inhabitants scattered upon theearth, would be all its remains like those of the miserable village ofGarigana.”42 [22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_429]“There is no water between Teawa and Beyla. Once Ingedidema and a number ofvillages were supplied with water from wells, and had large crops of Indian cornsown about their possessions. The curse of that country the Arabs Daveina havedestroyed Ingedidema, and all the villages about it; filled up their wells,burnt their crops, and exposed all the inhabitants to die by famine.”43[22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_1929]Soon after leaving Sennaar, he says, “We began now to see the effects of thequantity of rain having failed. There was little corn sown, and that so late, asto be scarcely above ground. It seems the rains begin later as they passnorthward. Many people were here employed in gathering grass-seeds to make avery bad kind of bread. These people appear perfect skeletons, and no wonder, asthey live upon such fare. Nothing increases the danger of travelling andprejudice against strangers, more than the scarcity of provisions in the countrythrough which you are to pass.44[22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_1931]“Came to Eltic, a straggling village about half a mile from the Nile, in thenorth of a large bare plain; all pasture, except the banks of the river whichare covered with wood. We now no longer saw any corn sown. The people here wereat the same miserable employment as those we had seen before, that of gatheringgrass-seeds.”45 [22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_1933]Under such circumstances of climate and political situation, though a greaterdegree of foresight, industry, and security, might considerably better theircondition, and increase their population, the birth of a greater number ofchildren without these concomitants, would only aggravate their misery, andleave their population where it was.The same may be said of the once flourishing and populous country of Egypt. Itspresent depressed state has not been caused by the weakening of the principle ofincrease, but by the weakening of the principle of industry and foresight, fromthe insecurity of property consequent on a most tyrannical and oppressivegovernment. The principle of increase in Egypt, at present, does all that ispossible for it to do. It keeps the population fully up to the level of themeans of subsistence; and, were its power ten times greater than it really is,it could do no more.The remains of ancient works, the vast lakes, canals, and large conduits forwater destined to keep the Nile under controul, serving as reservoirs to supplya scanty year, and as drains and outlets to prevent the superabundance of waterin wet years, sufficiently indicate to us, that the ancients by art and industrycontrived to fertilize a much greater quantity of land from the overflowings oftheir river, than is done at present; and to prevent, in some measure, thedistresses which are now so frequently experienced from a redundant orinsufficient inundation.46 [22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_431] Itis said of the governor Petronius, that, effecting by art what was denied bynature, he caused abundance to prevail in Egypt under the disadvantage of such adeficient inundation, as had always before been accompanied by dearth.47[22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_1935] A flood too great is as fatalto the husbandman, as one that is deficient; and the ancients had, inconsequence, drains and outlets to spread the superfluous waters over thethirsty sands of Lybia, and render even the desert habitable. These works arenow all out of repair, and by ill management often produce mischief instead ofgood. The causes of this neglect, and consequently of the diminished means ofsubsistence, are obviously to be traced to the extreme ignorance and brutalityof the government, and the wretched state of the people. The Mamelukes, in whomthe principal power resides, think only of enriching themselves, and employ forthis purpose what appears to them to be the simplest method, that of seizingwealth wherever it may be found, of wresting it by violence from the possessor,and of imposing continually new and arbitrary contributions.48[22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_1937] Their ignorance andbrutality, and the constant state of alarm in which they live, prevent them fromhaving any views of enriching the country; the better to prepare it for theirplunder. No public works therefore are to be expected from the government, andno individual proprietor dares to undertake any improvement which might implythe possession of capital, as it would probably be the immediate signal of hisdestruction. Under such circumstances, we cannot be surprised, that the ancientworks are neglected, that the soil is ill cultivated, and that the means ofsubsistence, and consequently the population, are greatly reduced. But such isthe natural fertility of the Delta from the inundations of the Nile, that evenwithout any capital employed upon the land, without a right of succession, andconsequently almost without a right of property, it still maintains aconsiderable population in proportion to its extent; sufficient, if propertywere secure, and industry well directed, gradually to improve and extend thecultivation of the country, and restore it to its former state of prosperity. Itmay be safely pronounced of Egypt, that it is not the want of population thathas checked its industry, but the want of industry that has checked itspopulation.The causes which keep down the population to the level of the present contractedmeans of subsistence are but too obvious. The peasants are allowed for theirmaintenance only sufficient to keep them alive.49[22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_437] A miserable sort of bread madeof doura without leaven or flavour, cold water, and raw onions, make up thewhole of their diet. Meat and fat, of which they are passionately fond, neverappear but on great occasions, and among those who are more at their ease. Theirhabitations are huts made of earth, where a stranger would be suffocated withthe heat and smoke; and where the diseases that are generated by want ofcleanliness, by moisture, and by bad nourishment, often visit them and commitgreat ravages. To these physical evils are added, a constant state of alarm, thefear of the plunder of the Arabs, and the visits of the Mamelukes, the spirit ofrevenge that is transmitted in families, and all the evils of a continued civilwar.50 [22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_435]In the year 1783 the plague was very fatal; and in 1784 and 1785, a dreadfulfamine reigned in Egypt, from a deficiency in the inundations of the Nile.Volney draws a frightful picture of the misery that was suffered on thisoccasion. The streets of Cairo, which at first were full of beggars, were sooncleared of all these objects, who either perished or fled. A vast number ofunfortunate wretches, in order to escape death, spread themselves over all theneighbouring countries, and the towns of Syria were inundated with Egyptians.The streets, and public places were crowded with extenuated and dying skeletons.All the most revolting modes of satisfying the cravings of hunger were resortedto; the most disgusting food was devoured with eagerness; and Volney mentionsthe having seen, under the walls of ancient Alexandria, two miserable wretchesseated on the carcase of a camel, and disputing with the dogs its putrid flesh.The depopulation of the two years was estimated at one sixth of all theinhabitants.51 [22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_433]NOTES1 [22_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_384].

IX.Of the Checks to Population in Siberia, Northern and Southern.THE inhabitants of the most northern parts of Asia subsist chiefly by huntingand fishing; and we may suppose, therefore, that the checks to their increaseare of the same nature as those which prevail among the American Indians; exceptthat the check from war is considerably less, and the check from famine,perhaps, greater than in the temperate regions of America. M. de Lesseps, whotravelled from Kamtschatka to Petersburgh with the papers of the unfortunatePerouse, draws a melancholy picture of the misery that is sometimes suffered inthis part of the world from a scarcity of food. He observes, while atBolcheretsk, a village of Kamtschatka, “very heavy rains are injurious in thiscountry, because they occasion floods, which drive the fish from the rivers. Afamine, the most distressing to the poor Kampschadales, is the result, as ithappened last year in all the villages along the western coast of the peninsula.This dreadful calamity occurs so frequently in this quarter, that theinhabitants are obliged to abandon their dwellings, and repair with theirfamilies to the borders of the Kamtschatka river, where they hope to find betterresources, fish being more plentiful in this river. M. Kasloff (the Russianofficer who conducted M. de Lesseps) had intended to proceed along the westerncoast; but the news of this famine determined him, contrary to his wishes, toreturn, rather than be driven to the necessity of stopping half way, orperishing with hunger.”1 [23_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_441] Thougha different route was pursued, yet in the course of the journey almost all thedogs which drew the sledges died for want of food; and every dog, as soon as hefailed, was immediately devoured by the others.2[23_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_439]Even at Okotsk, a town of considerable trade, the inhabitants wait with hungryimpatience for the breaking up of the river Okhota in the spring. When M. deLesseps was there, the stock of dried fish was nearly exhausted. Meal was sodear, that the common people were unable to purchase it. On drawing the seineprodigious numbers of small fish were caught, and the joy and clamour redoubledat the sight. The most famished were first served. M. de Lesseps feelingly says,“I could not refrain from tears on perceiving the ravenousness of these poorcreatures;**** whole families contended for the fish, which were devoured rawbefore my eyes.”3 [23_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_447]Throughout all the northern parts of Siberia, the small-pox is very fatal. InKampschatka, according to M. de Lesseps, it has carried off three fourths4[23_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1939] of the native inhabitants.Pallas confirms this account; and, in describing the Ostiacks on the Obi wholive nearly in the same manner, observes, that this disorder makes dreadfulravages among them, and may be considered as the principal check to theirincrease.5 [23_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_445] The extraordinarymortality of the small-pox among these people, is very naturally accounted for,from the extreme heat, filth, and putrid air, of their underground habitations.Three or four Ostiack families are crowded together in one yourt, and nothingcan be so disgusting as their mode of living. They never wash their hands, andthe putrid remains of the fish, and the excrements of the children, are nevercleared away. From this description, says Pallas, one may easily form an idea ofthe stench, the fœtid vapours, and humidity of their yourts.6[23_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1941] They have seldom manychildren. It is a rare thing to see three or four in one family. The reasonwhich Pallas gives, is, that so many die young on account of their badnourishment.7 [23_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_443] To this, perhaps,should be added the state of miserable and laborious servitude to which thewomen are condemned,8 [23_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1943] whichcertainly prevents them from being prolific.The Samoyedes, Pallas thinks, are not quite so dirty as the Ostiacks, becausethey are more in motion during the winter in hunting; but he describes the stateof the women amongst them as a still more wretched and laborious servitude;9[23_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1945] and consequently the check topopulation from this cause would be greater.Most of the natives of these inhospitable regions live nearly in the samemiserable manner, which it would be, therefore, mere repetition to describe.From what has been said, we may form an idea of the principal checks that keepthe actual population down to the level of the scanty means of subsistence whichthese dreary countries afford.In some of the southern parts of Siberia, and in the districts adjoining theWolga, the Russian travellers describe the soil to be of extraordinaryfertility. It consists in general of a fine black mould of so rich a nature asnot to require, or even to bear, dressing. Manure only makes the corn grow tooluxuriantly, and subjects it to fall to the ground and be spoiled. The only modeof recruiting this kind of land which is practised, is, by leaving it one yearout of three in fallow, and proceeding in this way, there are some grounds, thevigour of which is said to be inexhaustible.10[23_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_453] Yet notwithstanding thefacility with which, as it would appear, the most plentiful subsistence might beprocured, many of these districts are thinly peopled, and in none of them,perhaps, does population increase in the proportion that might be expected fromthe nature of the soil.Such countries seem to be under that moral impossibility of increasing, which iswell described by Sir James Steuart.11[23_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1947] Man, though he may often beproduced without a sufficient demand for him, cannot really multiply and prosperunless his labour be wanted; and the reason that the population goes on soslowly in these countries, is, that there is very little demand for men. Themode of agriculture is described to be extremely simple, and to require very fewlabourers. In some places the seed is merely thrown on the fallow.12[23_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_451] The buck-wheat is a commonculture; and though it is sown very thin, yet one sowing will last five or sixyears, and produce every year twelve or fifteen times the original quantity. Theseed which falls during the time of the harvest is sufficient for the next year,and it is only necessary to pass a harrow once over it in the spring. And thisis continued, till the fertility of the soil begins to diminish. It is observed,very justly, that the cultivation of no kind of grain can so exactly suit theindolent inhabitants of the plains of Siberia.13[23_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_449]With such a system of agriculture, and with few or no manufactures, the demandfor men must be very easily satisfied. Corn will undoubtedly be very cheap; butlabour will be in proportion still cheaper. Though the farmer may be able toprovide an ample quantity of food for his own children, yet the wages of hislabourer will not be sufficient to enable him to rear up a family with ease.If, from observing the deficiency of population, compared with the fertility ofthe soil, we were to endeavour to remedy it by giving a bounty upon children,and thus enabling the labourer to rear up a greater number; what would be theconsequence? Nobody would want the work of these supernumerary labourers thatwere thus brought into the market. Though the ample subsistence of a man for aday might be purchased for a penny, yet nobody will give these people a farthingfor their labour. The farmer is able to do all that he wishes, all that hethinks necessary in the cultivation of the soil, by means of his own family, andthe one or two labourers which he might have before. As these people, therefore,can give him nothing that he wants, it is not to be expected that he shouldovercome his natural indolence, and undertake a larger and more troublesomeconcern, merely to provide them gratuitously with food. In such a state ofthings, when the very small demand for manufacturing labour is satisfied, whatare the rest do? They are, in fact, as completely without the means ofsubsistence, as if they were living upon a barren sand. They must eitheremigrate to some place where their work is wanted, or perish miserably ofpoverty. Should they be prevented from suffering this last extremity by a scantysubsistence given to them, in consequence of a scanty and only occasional use oftheir labour, it is evident, that though they might exist themselves, they wouldnot be in a capacity to marry, and continue to increase the population.It might be supposed, perhaps, that if there were much good land unused, theredundant population would naturally betake itself to the cultivation of it, andraise its own food. But though there are many countries where good land remainsuncultivated, there are very few where it may be obtained by the first personwho chuses to occupy it. Even were this the case, there would be still someobstacles remaining. The supernumerary labourer whom I have described, has nofunds whatever, that can enable him to build a house, to purchase stock andutensils, and to subsist till he has brought his new land into proper order, andobtained an adequate return. Even the children of the farmer, when they grow up,would find it very difficult to obtain these necessary funds. In a state ofsociety where the market for corn is extremely narrow, and the price very low,the cultivators are always poor; and though they may be able amply to providefor their family, in the simple article of food; yet they cannot realise acapital to divide among their children, and enable them to undertake thecultivation of fresh land. Though this necessary capital might be very small,yet even this small sum, the farmer perhaps cannot acquire; for when he grows agreater quantity of corn than usual, he finds no purchaser for it,14[23_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_455] and cannot convert it into anypermanent article, which will enable any of his children to command anequivalent portion of subsistence or labour in future. In general, therefore, hecontents himself with growing only what is sufficient for the immediate demandsof his family, and the narrow market to which he is accustomed. And if he has alarge family, many of his children probably fall into the rank of labourers, andtheir further increase is checked, as in the case of the labourer beforedescribed, by a want of the means of subsistence.It is not therefore a direct encouragement to the procreation and rearing ofchildren that is wanted in these countries, in order to increase theirpopulation; but the creation of an effectual demand for the produce of the soil,by promoting the means of its distribution. This can only be effected, either bythe introduction of manufactures, and by inspiring the cultivator with a tastefor them, which must necessarily be a work of time; or by assisting newcolonists and the children of the old cultivators with capital to enable them tooccupy successively, and bring into cultivation, all the land that is fit forit.The late Empress of Russia adopted both these means of increasing the populationin her dominions. She encouraged both manufacturers and cultivators; andfurnished to foreigners of either description, capital, and funds forsubsistence, free of all interest for a certain term of years.15[23_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_459] These well-directed efforts,added to what had been done by Peter I. had, as might be expected, aconsiderable effect; and the Russian territories, particularly the Asiatic partof them, which had slumbered for centuries, with a population nearly stationary,or at most increasing very languidly, seem to have made a sudden start of lateyears. Though the population of the more fertile provinces of Siberia be stillvery inadequate to the richness of the soil; yet in some of them, agricultureflourishes in no inconsiderable degree, and great quantities of corn are grown.In a general dearth which happened in 1769, the province of Isetsk was able,notwithstanding a scanty harvest, to supply, in the usual manner, the founderiesand forges of Ural, besides preserving from the horrors of famine all theneighbouring provinces.16 [23_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_457] Andin the territory of Krasnoyarsk, on the shores of the Yenissey, in spite of theindolence and drunkenness of the inhabitants, the abundance of corn is so great,that no instance has ever been known of a general failure.17[23_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1949] Pallas justly observes, if weconsider that Siberia, not two hundred years ago, was a wilderness utterlyunknown, and, in point of population, was even far behind the almost deserttracts of North America, we may justly be astonished at the present state ofthis part of the world, and at the multitude of its Russian inhabitants, who innumbers greatly exceed the natives.18[23_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1951]When Pallas was in Siberia, provisions in these fertile districts, particularlyin the environs of Krasnoyarsk, were most extraordinarily cheap. A pood, orforty pounds, of wheaten flour, was sold for about twopence halfpenny, an ox forfive or six shillings, and a cow for three or four.19[23_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_469] This unnatural cheapness, owingto a want of vent for the products of the soil, was perhaps the principal checkto the population. In the period which has since elapsed, the prices have risenconsiderably;20 [23_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1953] and we mayconclude, therefore, that the object principally wanted has been attained, andthat the population proceeds with rapid strides.Pallas, however, complains, that the intentions of the Empress respecting thepeopling of Siberia, were not always well fulfilled by her subordinate agents,and that the proprietors, to whose care this was left, often sent off colonists,in every respect unfit for the purpose, in regard to age, diseases, and want ofindustrious habits.21 [23_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_467] Even theGerman settlers in the districts near the Wolga, are, according to Pallas,deficient in this last point,22[23_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1955] and this is certainly a mostessential one. It may, indeed, be safely asserted, that the importation ofindustry is of infinitely more consequence to the population of a country, thanthe importation of men and women considered only with regard to numbers. Were itpossible at once to change the habits of a whole people, and to direct itsindustry at pleasure, no government would ever be reduced to the necessity ofencouraging foreign settlers. But to change long-existing habits is of allenterprizes the most difficult. Many years must elapse under the most favourablecircumstances, before the Siberian boor will possess the industry and activityof an English labourer. And though the Russian government has been incessant inits endeavours, to convert the pastoral tribes of Siberia to agriculture; yetmany obstinately persist in bidding defiance to any attempts that can be made towean them from their injurious sloth.23[23_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_465]Many obstacles concur to prevent that rapid growth of the Russian colonies whichthe procreative power would permit. Some of the low countries of Siberia areunhealthy, from the number of marshes which they contain,24[23_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_463] and great and wastingepizooties are frequent among the cattle.25[23_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1957] In the districts near theWolga, though the soil is naturally rich, yet droughts are so frequent, thatthere is seldom more than one good harvest out of three.26[23_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_461] The colonists of Saratof, afterthey had been settled for some years, were obliged to remove on this account toother districts, and the whole expence of building their houses, amounting toabove a million of rubles, was remitted to them by the Empress.27[23_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1959] For purposes either of safetyor convenience, the houses of each colony are all built contiguous, or nearlyso, and not scattered about upon the different farms. A want of room is, inconsequence, soon felt in the immediate neighbourhood of the village, while thedistant grounds remain in a state of very imperfect cultivation. On observingthis in the colony of Kotschesnaia, Pallas proposed that a certain part shouldbe removed by the Empress to other districts, that the remainder might be leftmore at their ease.28 [23_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_471] Thisproposal seems to prove that spontaneous divisions of this kind did not oftentake place, and that the children of the colonists might not always find an easymode of settling themselves, and rearing up fresh families. In the flourishingcolony of the Moravian brethren at Sarepta, it is said, that the young peoplecannot marry without the consent of their priests; and that their consent is notin general granted till late.29[23_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1961] It would appear, therefore,that among the obstacles to the increase of population, even in these newcolonies, the preventive check has its share. Population can never increase withgreat rapidity but when the price of common labour is very high, as in America;and from the state of society in this part of the Russian territories, and theconsequent want of a proper vent for the produce of industry, this effect, whichusually accompanies new colonies, and is essential to their rapid growth, doesnot take place in any considerable degree.NOTES1 [23_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_440].

X.Of the Checks to Population in the Turkish Dominions, and Persia.IN the Asiatic parts of the Turkish dominions, it will not be difficult, fromthe accounts of travellers, to trace the checks to population, and the causes ofits present decay; and as there is little difference in the manners of theTurks, whether they inhabit Europe or Asia, it will not be worth while to makethem the subject of distinct consideration.The fundamental cause of the low state of population in Turkey, compared withits extent of territory, is undoubtedly the nature of the government. Itstyranny, its feebleness, its bad laws, and worse administration of them, withthe consequent insecurity of property, throw such obstacles in the way ofagriculture, that the means of subsistence are necessarily decreasing yearly,and with them, of course, the number of people. The miri, or general land tax,paid to the sultan, is in itself moderate;1[24_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_475] but by abuses inherent in theTurkish government, the pachas, and their agents, have found out the means ofrendering it ruinous. Though they cannot absolutely alter the impost which hasbeen established by the sultan, they have introduced a multitude of changes,which, without the name, produce all the effects of an augmentation.2[24_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1963] In Syria, according toVolney, having the greatest part of the land at their disposal, they clog theirconcessions with burdensome conditions, and exact the half, and sometimes eventwo thirds, of the crop. When the harvest is over, they cavil about losses, and,as they have the power in their hands, they carry off what they think proper. Ifthe season fail, they still exact the same sum, and expose every thing that thepoor peasant possesses to sale. To these constant oppressions, are added athousand accidental extortions. Sometimes a whole village is laid undercontribution for some real or imaginary offence. Arbitrary presents are exactedon the accession of each governor; grass, barley, and straw, are demanded forhis horses; and commissions are multiplied, that the soldiers who carry theorders may live upon the starving peasants, whom they treat with the most brutalinsolence and injustice.3 [24_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_473]The consequence of these depredations is, that the poorer class of inhabitants,ruined, and unable any longer to pay the miri, become a burden to the village,or fly into the cities; but the miri is unalterable, and the sum to be leviedmust be found somewhere. The portion of those who are thus driven from theirhomes falls on the remaining inhabitants, whose burden, though at first light,now becomes insupportable. If they should be visited by two years of drought andfamine, the whole village is ruined and abandoned; and the tax, which it shouldhave paid, is levied on the neighbouring lands.4[24_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_479]The same mode of proceeding takes place, with regard to the tax on theChristians, which has been raised by these means from three, five, and elevenpiastres, at which it was first fixed, to thirty-five and forty, whichabsolutely impoverishes those on whom it is levied, and obliges them to leavethe country. It has been remarked, that these exactions have made a rapidprogress during the last forty years, from which time are dated the decline ofagriculture, the depopulation of the country, and the diminution in the quantityof specie carried to Constantinople.5[24_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1965]The peasants are every where reduced to a little flat cake of barley, or doura,onions, lentils, and water. Not to lose any part of their corn, they leave in itall sorts of wild grain, which often produces bad consequences. In the mountainsof Lebanon and Nablous, in time of dearth, they gather the acorns from the oaks,which they eat after boiling, or roasting them on the ashes.6[24_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_477]By a natural consequence of this misery, the art of cultivation is in the mostdeplorable state. The husbandman is almost without instruments, and those hehas, are very bad. His plough is frequently no more than the branch of a treecut below a fork, and used without wheels. The ground is tilled by asses andcows; rarely by oxen, which would bespeak too much riches. In the districtsexposed to the Arabs, as in Palestine, the countryman must sow with his musketin his hand; and scarcely does the corn turn yellow, before it is reaped andconcealed in subterraneous caverns. As little as possible is employed for seedcorn, because the peasants sow no more than is barely necessary for theirsubsistence. Their whole industry is limited to a supply of their immediatewants; and to procure a little bread, a few onions, a blue shirt, and a bit ofwoollen, much labour is not necessary. “The peasant lives therefore in distress;but at least he does not enrich his “tyrants, and the avarice of despotism isits own punishment.”7 [24_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1967]This picture, which is drawn by Volney, in describing the state of the peasantsin Syria, seems to be confirmed by all the other travellers in these countries;and, according to Eton, it represents very nearly the condition of the peasantsin the greatest part of the Turkish dominions.8[24_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_483] Universally, the offices ofevery denomination are set up to public sale, and in the intrigues of theseraglio, by which the disposal of all places is regulated, every thing is doneby means of bribes. The pachas, in consequence, who are sent into the provinces,exert to the utmost their power of extortion; but are always outdone by theofficers immediately below them, who, in their turn, leave room for theirsubordinate agents.9 [24_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_481]The pacha must raise money to pay the tribute, and also to indemnify himself forthe purchase of his office; support his dignity, and make a provision in case ofaccidents; and, as all power, both military and civil, centers in his person,from his representing the sultan, the means are at his discretion, and thequickest are invariably considered as the best.10[24_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1969] Uncertain of to-morrow, hetreats his province as a mere transient possession, and endeavours to reap, ifpossible, in one day, the fruit of many years, without the smallest regard tohis successor, or the injury that he may do to the permanent revenue.11[24_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1971]The cultivator is necessarily more exposed to these extortions than theinhabitants of the towns. From the nature of his employment, he is fixed to onespot, and the productions of agriculture do not admit of being easily concealed.The tenure of the land and the right of succession are besides uncertain. When afather dies, the inheritance reverts to the sultan, and the children can onlyredeem the succession by a considerable sum of money. These considerationsnaturally occasion an indifference to landed estates. The country is deserted,and each person is desirous of flying to the towns, where he will not only ingeneral meet with better treatment, but may hope to acquire a species of wealth,which he can more easily conceal from the eyes of his rapacious masters.12[24_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1973]To complete the ruin of agriculture, a maximum is in many cases established, andthe peasants are obliged to furnish the towns with corn at a fixed price. It isa maxim of Turkish policy, originating in the feebleness of the government, andthe fear of popular tumults, to keep the price of corn low in all theconsiderable towns. In the case of a failure in the harvest, every person whopossesses any corn is obliged to sell it at the price fixed, under pain ofdeath; and if there be none in the neighbourhood, other districts are ransackedfor it.13 [24_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_489] When Constantinopleis in want of provisions, ten provinces are perhaps famished for a supply.14[24_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1975] At Damascus, during ascarcity in 1784, the people paid only one penny farthing a pound for theirbread, while the peasants in the villages were absolutely dying with hunger.15[24_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_487]The effect of such a system of government on agriculture, need not be insistedupon. The causes of the decreasing means of subsistence are but too obvious; andthe checks which keep the population down to the level of these decreasingresources, may be traced with nearly equal certainty; and will appear to includealmost every species of vice and misery that is known.It is observed, in general, that the Christian families consist of a greaternumber of children, than the Mahometan families where polygamy prevails.16[24_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1977] This is an extraordinaryfact; because, though polygamy, from the unequal distribution of women which itoccasions, be naturally unfavourable to the population of a whole country; yetthe individuals who are able to support a plurality of wives, ought certainly,in the natural course of things, to have a greater number of children, thanthose who are confined to one. The way in which Volney principally accounts forthis fact is, that, from the practice of polygamy, and very early marriages, theTurks are enervated while young, and impotence at thirty is very common.17[24_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_485] Eton notices an unnaturalvice, as prevailing in no inconsiderable degree among the common people, andconsiders it as one of the checks to the population;18[24_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1979] but the five principal causesof depopulation which he enumerates, are,1. The plague, from which the empire is never entirely free.2. Those terrible disorders which almost always follow it, at least in Asia.3. Epidemic and endemic maladies in Asia, which make as dreadful ravages as theplague itself, and which frequently visit that part of the empire.4. Famine.5. And lastly, the sicknesses which always follow a famine, and which occasion amuch greater mortality.19 [24_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1981]He afterwards gives a more particular account of the devastations of the plaguein different parts of the empire, and concludes by observing, that if thenumbers of the Mahometans have decreased, this cause alone is adequate to theeffect;20 [24_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_497] and that, thingsgoing on in their present train, the Turkish population will be extinct inanother century.21 [24_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1983] But thisinference, and the calculations which relate to it, are without doubt erroneous.The increase of population in the intervals of these periods of mortality, isprobably greater than he is aware of. At the same time, it must be remarked,that in a country where the industry of the husbandman is confined to the supplyof his necessary wants, where he sows only to prevent himself from starving, andis unable to accumulate any surplus produce, a great loss of people is noteasily recovered, as the natural effects from the diminished numbers cannot befelt in the same degree, as in countries where industry prevails, and propertyis secure.According to the Persian legislator, Zoroaster, to plant a tree, to cultivate afield, to beget children, are meritorious acts; but it appears, from the accountof travellers, that many among the lower classes of people cannot easily attainthe latter species of merit; and in this instance, as in numberless others, theprivate interest of the individual corrects the errors of the legislator. SirJohn Chardin says, that matrimony in Persia is very expensive, and that only menof estates will venture upon it, lest it prove their ruin.22[24_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_495] The Russian travellers seem toconfirm this account, and observe, that the lower classes of people are obligedto defer marriage till late; and that it is only among the rich that this uniontakes place early.23 [24_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_493]The dreadful convulsions to which Persia has been continually subject for manyhundred years, must have been fatal to her agriculture. The periods of reposefrom external wars, and internal commotions, have been short and few, and evenduring the times of profound peace, the frontier provinces have been constantlysubject to the ravages of the Tartars.The effect of this state of things is such as might be expected. The proportionof uncultivated, to cultivated land, in Persia, Sir John Chardin states to be,ten to one;24 [24_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_491] and the mode inwhich the officers of the Shah and private owners let out their lands tohusbandmen, is not that which is best calculated to reanimate industry. Thegrain in Persia is, besides, much subject to be destroyed by hail, drought,locusts, and other insects,25 [24_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1985]which probably tends rather to discourage the employment of capital in thecultivation of the soil.The plague does not extend to Persia; but the small-pox is mentioned by theRussian travellers, as making very fatal ravages.26[24_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_499]It will not be worth while to enter more minutely on the checks to population inPersia, as they seem to be nearly similar to those which have been justdescribed in the Turkish dominions. The superior destruction of the plague inTurkey, is, perhaps, nearly balanced by the greater frequency of internalcommotions in Persia.NOTES1 [24_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_474].

XI.Of the Checks to Population in Indostan and Tibet.IN the ordinances of Menu, the Indian legislator, which Sir Wm. Jones hastranslated and called the Institutes of Hindu Law, marriage is very greatlyencouraged, and a male heir is considered as an object of the first importance.“By a son, a man obtains victory over all people; by a son’s son, he en-joysimmortality; and afterwards, by the son of that grandson, he reaches the solarabode.”“Since the son delivers his father from the hell, named put, he was thereforecalled puttra, by Brahma himself.”1[25_XI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_505]Among the different nuptial rites, Menu has ascribed particular qualities toeach.“A son of a Bráhmì, or wife, by the first ceremony, redeems from sin, if heperform virtuous acts, ten ancestors, ten descendants, and himself, thetwenty-first person.”“A son born of a wife by the Daiva nuptials, redeems seven and seven, in higherand lower degrees; of a wife by the Arsha, three and three; of a wife by thePrájápatya, six and six.”2 [25_XI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_503]A housekeeper is considered as of the most eminent order. “The divine sages, themanes, the gods, the spirits, and guests, pray for benefits to masters offamilies.”3 [25_XI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_501] An elder brothernot married before the younger is mentioned among the persons who areparticularly to be shunned.4 [25_XI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1987]Such ordinances would naturally cause marriage to be considered as a religiousduty; yet it seems to be rather a succession of male heirs, than a very numerousprogeny, that is the object so much desired.“The father having begotten a son, discharges his debt to his own progenitors.”“That son alone, by whose birth he discharges the debt, and through whom heattains immortality, was begotten from a sense of duty; all the rest areconsidered by the wife as begotten from love of pleasure.”5[25_XI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_507]A widow is, on some occasions, allowed to have one son by the brother, or someappointed kinsman of the deceased husband, but on no account a second. “Thefirst object of the appointment being obtained, according to law, both thebrother and the sister must live together like a father and daughter byaffinity.”6 [25_XI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1989]In almost every part of the ordinances of Menu, sensuality of all kinds isstrongly reprobated, and chastity inculcated as a religious duty.“A man by the attachment of his organs to sensual pleasure incurs certain guilt;but having wholly subdued them, he thence attains heavenly bliss.”“Whatever man may obtain all those gratifications, or whatever man may resignthem completely, the resignation of all pleasures is far better than theattainment of them.”7 [25_XI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1991]It is reasonable to suppose, that such passages might, in some degree, tend tocounteract those encouragements to increase, which, have been before mentioned,and might prompt some religious persons to desist from further indulgencies whenthey had obtained one son, or to remain more contented than they otherwise wouldhave been, in an unmarried state. Strict and absolute chastity, seems, indeed,to supersede the obligation of having descendants.“Many thousands of Brahmens having avoided sensuality from their early youth,and having left no issue in their families, have ascended nevertheless toheaven.”“And, like those abstemious men, a virtuous wife ascends to heaven, though shehave no child, if, after the decease of her lord, she devote herself to piousausterity.”8 [25_XI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1993]The permission to a brother, or other kinsman, to raise up an heir for thedeceased husband, which has been noticed, extends only to women of the servileclass.9 [25_XI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1995] Those of the higherclasses are not even to pronounce the name of another man, but to“Continue till death forgiving all injuries, performing harsh duties, avoidingevery sensual pleasure, and cheerfully practising the incomparable rules ofvirtue.”10 [25_XI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1997]Besides these strict precepts relating to the government of the passions, othercircumstances would perhaps concur to prevent the full effect of the ordinanceswhich encourage marriage.The division of the people into classes, and the continuance of the sameprofession in the same family, would be the means of pointing out to eachindividual, in a clear and distinct manner, his future prospects respecting alivelihood; and from the gains of his father, he would be easily enabled tojudge whether he could support a family by the same employment. And though, whena man cannot gain a subsistence in the employments appropriate to his class, itis allowable for him, under certain restrictions, to seek it in another; yetsome kind of disgrace seems to attach to this expedient, and it is not probablethat many persons would marry with the certain prospect of being obliged thus tofall from their class, and to lower in so marked a manner their condition inlife.In addition to this, the choice of a wife seems to be a point of considerabledifficulty. A man might remain unmarried for some time, before he could findexactly such a companion as the legislator prescribes. Ten families of a certaindescription, be they ever so great, or ever so rich in kine, goats, sheep, gold,and grain, are studiously to be avoided. Girls with too little or too much hair,who are too talkative, who have bad eyes, a disagreeable name, or any kind ofsickness, who have no brother, or whose father is not well known, are all, withmany others, excluded; and the choice will appear to be in some degree confined,when it must necessarily rest upon“A girl, whose form has no defect; who has an agreeable name; who walksgracefully, like a phenicopteros, or a young elephant; whose hair and teeth aremoderate respectively in quantity and size; whose body has exquisitesoftness.”11 [25_XI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_511]It is observed, that a woman of the servile class is not mentioned, even in therecital of any ancient story, as the wife of a Brahmen or of a Cshatriya, thoughin the greatest difficulty to find a suitable match; which scems to imply thatsuch a difficulty might sometimes occur.12[25_XI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1999]Another obstacle to marriage arising from the Hindoo customs, is, that an elderbrother who does not marry, seems in a manner to confine all his other brothersto the same state; for a younger brother who marries before the elder incursdisgrace, and is mentioned among the persons who ought to be shunned.13[25_XI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_509]The character which the legislator draws of the manners and disposition of thewomen in India is most extremely unfavourable. Among many other passagesexpressed with equal severity, he observes, that,“Through their passion for men, their mutable temper, their want of settledaffection, and their perverse nature, (let them be guarded in this world ever sowell), they soon become alienated from their husbands.”14[25_XI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_517]This character, if true, probably proceeded from their never being allowed thesmallest degree of liberty,15 [25_XI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2001]and from the state of degradation to which they were reduced by the practice ofpolygamy; but however this may be, such passages tend strongly to shew, thatillicit intercourse between the sexes was frequent notwithstanding the lawsagainst adultery. These laws are noticed as not relating to the wives of publicdancers or singers, or of such base men as lived by the intrigues of theirwives;16 [25_XI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_515] a proof that thesecharacters were not uncommon, and were to a certain degree permitted. Add tothis, that the practice of polygamy17[25_XI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2003] among the rich, wouldsometimes render it difficult for the lower classes of people to obtain wives;and this difficulty would probably fall particularly hard on those who werereduced to the condition of slaves.From all these circumstances combined, it seems probable, that among the checksto population in India, the preventive check would have its share; but from theprevailing habits and opinions of the people, there is reason to believe, thatthe tendency to early marriages was still always predominant, and in generalprompted every person to enter into this state, who could look forward to theslightest chance of being able to maintain a family. The natural consequence ofthis was, that the lower classes of people were reduced to extreme poverty, andwere compelled to adopt the most frugal and scanty mode of subsistence. Thisfrugality was still further increased, and extended in some degree to the higherclasses of society, by its being considered as an eminent virtue.18[25_XI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_513] The population would thus bepressed hard against the limits of the means of subsistence, and the food of thecountry would be meted out to the major part of the people in the smallestshares that could support life. In such a state of things, every failure in thecrops from unfavourable seasons would be felt most severely; and India, as mightbe expected, has in all ages been subject to the most dreadful famines.A part of the ordinances of Menu is expressly dedicated to the consideration oftimes of distress, and instructions are given to the different classesrespecting their conduct during these periods. Brahmens pining with hunger andwant are frequently mentioned;19[25_XI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_523] and certain ancient andvirtuous characters are described, who had done impure and unlawful acts, butwho were considered by the legislator as justified, on account of theextremities to which they were reduced.“Ajígarta, dying with hunger, was going to destroy his own son by selling himfor some cattle; yet he was guilty of no crime, for he only sought a remedyagainst famishing.”“Vámadéva, who well knew right and wrong, was by no means rendered impure,though desirous, when oppressed by hunger, of eating the flesh of dogs.”“Viswámitra too, than whom none knew better the distinctions between virtue andvice, resolved, when he was perishing with hunger, to eat the haunch of a dog,which he had received from a Chandála.”20[25_XI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2005]If these great and virtuous men of the highest class, whom all persons wereunder the obligation of assisting, could be reduced to such extremities, we mayeasily conjecture what must have been the sufferings of the lowest class.Such passages clearly prove the existence of seasons of the most severedistress, at the early period when these ordinances were composed; and we havereason to think that they have occurred at irregular intervals ever since. Oneof the Jesuits says, that it is impossible for him to describe the misery towhich he was witness, during the two years famine in 1737 and 1738;21[25_XI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_521] but the description which hegives of it, and of the mortality which it occasioned, is sufficiently dreadfulwithout further detail. Another Jesuit, speaking more generally, says, “Everyyear we baptize a thousand children, whom their parents can no longer feed, orwho, being likely to die, are sold to us by their mothers in order to get rid ofthem.”22 [25_XI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2007]The positive checks to population would of course fall principally upon theSudrá class, and those still more miserable beings, who are the outcasts of allthe classes, and are not even suffered to live within the towns.23[25_XI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_519]On this part of the population the epidemics which are the consequences ofindigence and bad nourishment, and the mortality among young children, wouldnecessarily make great ravages; and thousands of these unhappy wretches wouldprobably be swept off in a period of scarcity, before any considerable degree ofwant had reached the middle classes of the society. The Abbé Raynal says, onwhat authority I know not, that when the crops of rice fail, the huts of thesepoor outcasts are set on fire, and the flying inhabitants shot by theproprietors of the grounds, that they may not consume any part of the produce.24[25_XI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_527]The difficulty of rearing a family, even among the middle and higher classes ofsociety, or the fear of sinking from their cast, has driven the people in someparts of India to adopt the most cruel expedients to prevent a numerousoffspring. In a tribe on the frontiers of Junapore, a district of the provinceof Benares, the practice of destroying female infants has been fullysubstantiated. The mothers were compelled to starve them. The reason that thepeople gave for this cruel practice, was, the great expence of procuringsuitable matches for their daughters. One village only furnished an exception tothis rule, and in this village several old maids were living. It would naturallyoccur, that the race could not be continued upon this principle; but itappeared, that the particular exceptions to the general rule, and theintermarriages with other tribes, were sufficient for this purpose. Our EastIndia Company obliged these people to enter into an engagement not to continuethis inhuman practice.25 [25_XI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_525]On the coast of Malabar the Nayrs do not enter into regular marriages, and theright of inheritance and succession rests in the mother of the brother, orotherwise goes to the sister’s son, the father of the child being alwaysconsidered as uncertain.Among the Brahmens, when there are more brothers than one, only the elder, oreldest of them, marries. The brothers who thus maintain celibacy cohabit withNayr women without marriage in the way of the Nayrs. If the eldest brother hasnot a son, then the next brother marries.Among the Nayrs, it is the custom for one Nayr woman to have attached to her twomales, or four, or perhaps more.The lower casts, such as carpenters, ironsmiths, and others, have fallen intothe imitation of their superiors, with this difference, that the joint concernin one woman is confined to brothers and male relations by blood, to the endthat no alienation may take place in the course of the succession.26[25_XI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2009]Montesquieu takes notice of this custom of the Nayrs on the coast of Malabar,and accounts for it on the supposition that it was adopted in order to weakenthe family ties of this cast, that, as soldiers, they might be more at libertyto follow the calls of their profession; but I should think that it originated,more probably, in a fear of the poverty arising from a large family,particularly, as the custom seems to have been adopted by the other classes.27[25_XI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_531]In Tibet, according to Turner’s late account of it, a custom of this kindprevails generally. Without pretending absolutely to determine the question ofits origin, Mr. Turner leans to the supposition that it arose from the fear of apopulation too great for an unfertile country. From travelling much in the east,he had probably been led to observe the effects necessarily resulting from anoverflowing population, and is in consequence one among the very few writers whosee these effects in their true light. He expresses himself very strongly onthis subject, and, in reference to the custom above mentioned, says, “Itcertainly appears, that a superabundant population in an unfertile country mustbe the greatest of all calamities, and produce eternal warfare or eternal want.Either the most active and the most able part of the community must be compelledto emigrate, and to become soldiers of fortune, or merchants of chance; or else,if they remain at home, be liable to fall a prey to famine, in consequence ofsome accidental failure in their scanty crops. By thus linking whole familiestogether in the matrimonial yoke, the too rapid increase of population wasperhaps checked, and an alarm prevented, capable of pervading the most fertileregion upon the earth, and of giving birth to the most inhuman and unnaturalpractice, in the richest, the most productive, and the most populous country inthe world. I allude to the empire of China, where a mother, not foreseeing themeans of raising or providing for a numerous family, exposes her newborn infantto perish in the fields; a crime, however odious, by no means, I am assured,unfrequent.”28 [25_XI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_529]In almost every country of the globe individuals are impelled, by considerationsof private interest, to habits which tend to repress the natural increase ofpopulation; but Tibet is perhaps the only country where these habits areuniversally encouraged by the government, and where to repress, rather than toencourage population, seems to be a public object.In the first career of life the Bootea is recommended to distinction by acontinuance in a state of celibacy, as, on the contrary, any matrimonialcontract proves almost a certain hindrance to his rise in rank, or hisadvancement to offices of political importance. Population is thus opposed bythe two powerful bars of ambition and religion; and the higher orders of men,entirely engrossed by political or ecclesiastical duties, leave to thehusbandman and labourer, to those who till the fields and live by theirindustry, the exclusive charge of propagating the species.29[25_XI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_537]Hence religious retirement is frequent,30[25_XI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2013] and the number of monasteriesand nunneries is considerable. The strictest laws exist to prevent a woman fromaccidently passing a night within the limits of the one, or a man within thoseof the other; and a regulation is framed, completely to obviate abuse, andestablish respect towards the sacred orders of both sexes.The nation is divided into two distinct and separate classes, those who carry onthe business of the world, and those who hold intercourse with heaven. Nointerference of the laity ever interrupts the regulated duties of the clergy.The latter, by mutual compact, take charge of all spiritual concerns; and theformer, by their labours, enrich and populate the state.31[25_XI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_535]But, even among the laity, the business of population goes on very coldly. Allthe brothers of a family, without any restriction of age or of numbers,associate their fortunes with one female, who is chosen by the eldest, andconsidered as the mistress of the house; and whatever may be the profits oftheir several pursuits, the result flows into the common store.32[25_XI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2011]The number of husbands is not, apparently, defined or restricted within anylimits. It sometimes happens that in a small family there is but one male; andthe number, Mr. Turner says, may seldom exceed that which a native of rank atTeshoo Loomboo pointed out to him in a family resident in the neighbourhood, inwhich five brothers were then living together very happily with one female underthe same connubial compact. Nor is this sort of league confined to the lowerranks of people alone, it is found also frequently in the most opulentfamilies.33 [25_XI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_533]It is evident that this custom, combined with the celibacy of such a numerousbody of ecclesiastics, must operate in the most powerful manner as a preventivecheck to population. Yet notwithstanding this excessive check, it would appear,from Mr. Turner’s account of the natural sterility of the soil, that thepopulation is kept up to the level of the means of subsistence, and this seemsto be confirmed by the number of beggars in Teshoo Loomboo. On these beggars,and the charity which feeds them, Mr. Turner’s remark, though common, is yet sojust and important, that it cannot be too often repeated.“Thus I unexpectedly discovered,” he says, where I had constantly seen the roundof life moving in a tranquil regular routine, a mass of indigence and idlenessof which I had no idea. But yet it by no means surprised me, when I consideredthat wherever indiscriminate charity exists, it will never want objects on whichto exercise its bounty, but will always attract expectants more numerous than ithas the means to gratify. No human being can suffer want at Teshoo Loomboo. Itis on this humane disposition that a multitude even of Musselmen, of a frameprobably the largest and most robust in the world, place their reliance for themere maintenance of a feeble life; and besides these, I am informed, that noless than three hundred Hindoos, Goseins, and Sunniasses, are daily fed at thisplace by the Lama’s bounty.”34 [25_XI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_539]NOTES1 [25_XI__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_504].

XII.Of the Checks to Population in China and Japan.THE account which has lately been given of the population of China is soextraordinary, as to startle the faith of many readers, and tempt them tosuppose, either that some accidental error must have crept into the calculationsfrom an ignorance of the language, or that the mandarin who gave Sir GeorgeStaunton the information, must have been prompted by a national pride, which iscommon every where, but is particularly remarkable in China, to exaggerate thepower and resources of his country. It must be allowed, that neither of thesecircumstances is very improbable; at the same time it will be found, that thestatement of Sir George Staunton, does not very essentially differ from otheraccounts of good authority; and so far from involving any contradiction, isrendered probable, by a reference to those descriptions of the fertility ofChina in which all the writers who have visited the country agree.According to Duhalde, in the poll made at the beginning of the reign of Kang-hi,there were found 11,052,872 families, and 59,788,364 men able to bear arms; andyet, neither the princes, nor the officers of the court, nor the mandarins, northe soldiers who had served and been discharged; nor the literati, thelicentiates, the doctors, the bonzas, nor young persons under twenty years ofage; nor the great multitudes living either on the sea, or on rivers in barks,are comprehended in this number.1[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_543]The proportion which the number of men of a military age, bears to the wholepopulation of any country, is generally estimated as 1 to 4. If we multiply59,788,364 by 4, the result will be 239,153,456; but in the general calculationson this subject, a youth is considered as capable of bearing arms before he istwenty. We ought therefore to have multiplied by a higher number. The exceptionsto the poll seem to include almost all the superior classes of society, and avery great number among the lower. When all these circumstances are taken intoconsideration, the whole population, according to Duhalde, will not appear tofall very short of the 333,000,000 mentioned by Sir George Staunton.2[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_541]The small number of families, in proportion to the number of persons able tobear arms, which is a striking part of this statement of Duhalde, is accountedfor by a custom noticed by Sir George Stauntton as general in China. In theinclosure belonging to one dwelling, he observes, that a whole family of threegenerations, with all their respective wives and children, will frequently befound. One small room is made to serve for the individuals of each family,sleeping in different beds, divided only by mats hanging from the ceiling. Onecommon room is used for eating.3[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_547] In China there is, besides, aprodigious number of slaves,4 [26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2015]who will, of course, be reckoned as part of the families to which they belong.These two circumstances may perhaps be sufficient to account for what at firstappears to be a contradiction in the statement.To account for this population, it will not be necessary to recur to thesupposition of Montesquieu, that the climate of China is in any peculiar mannerfavourable to the production of children, and that the women are more prolificthan in any other part of the world.5[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_545] The causes which haveprincipally contributed to produce this effect, appear to be the following:First, the excellence of the natural soil, and its advantageous position in thewarmest parts of the temperate zone; a situation the most favourable to theproductions of the earth. Duhalde has a long chapter on the plenty which reignsin China, in which he observes, that almost all that other kingdoms afford, maybe found in China; but that China produces an infinite number of things whichare to be found no where else. This plenty, he says, may be attributed as wellto the depth of the soil, as to the painful industry of its inhabitants, and thegreat number of lakes, rivers, brooks, and canals, wherewith the country iswatered.6 [26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2017]Secondly, The very great encouragement that from the beginning of the monarchyhas been given to agriculture, which has directed the labours of the people tothe production of the greatest possible quantity of human subsistence. Duhaldesays, that what makes these people undergo such incredible fatigues incultivating the earth, is not barely their private interest, but rather theveneration paid to agriculture, and the esteem which the emperors themselveshave always had for it, from the commencement of the monarchy. One emperor ofthe highest reputation was taken from the plough to sit on the throne. Anotherfound out the art of draining water from several low countries, which were, tillthen, covered with it, of conveying it in canals to the sea, and of using thesecanals to render the soil fruitful.7[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_551] He besides wrote several bookson the manner of cultivating land, by dunging, tilling, and watering it. Manyother emperors expressed their zeal for this art, and made laws to promote it;but none raised its esteem to a higher pitch than Ven-ti, who reigned 179 yearsbefore Christ. This prince, perceiving that his country was ruined by wars,resolved to engage his subjects to cultivate their lands, by the example ofploughing with his own hands the land belonging to his palace, which obliged allthe ministers and great men of his court to do the same.8[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2019]A great festival, of which this is thought to be the origin, is solemnized everyyear in all the cities of China on the day that the sun enters the fifteenthdegree of Aquarius, which the Chinese consider as the beginning of their spring.The emperor goes himself in a solemn manner to plough a few ridges of land, inorder to animate the husbandman by his own example; and the mandarins of everycity perform the same ceremony.9[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2021] Princes of the blood, andother illustrious persons, hold the plough after the emperor, and the ceremonyis preceded by the spring sacrifice which the emperor, as chief pontiff, offersto Shang-ti to procure plenty in favour of his people.The reigning emperor, in the time of Duhalde, celebrated this festival withextraordinary solemnity, and in other respects shewed an uncommon regard forhusbandmen. To encourage them in their labours, he ordered the governors of allthe cities to send him notice every year of the person in this profession, intheir respective districts, who was most remarkable for his application toagriculture, for unblemished reputation, for preserving union in his own family,and peace with his neighbours, and for his frugality and aversion to allextravagance.10 [26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_549] The mandarinsin their different provinces encourage with honours the vigilant cultivator, andstigmatize with disgrace the man whose lands are neglected.11[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2023]In a country, in which the whole of the government is of the patriarchal kind,and the emperor is venerated as the father of his people, and the fountain ofinstruction, it is natural to suppose, that these high honours paid toagriculture should have a powerful effect. In the gradations of rank, they haveraised the husbandman above the merchant or mechanic,12[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2025] and the great object ofambition among the lower classes, is, in consequence, to become possessed of asmall portion of land. The number of manufacturers bears but a veryinconsiderable proportion to that of husbandmen in China;13[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2027] and the whole surface of theempire is, with trifling exceptions, dedicated to the production of food for manalone. There is no meadow, and very little pasture; neither are the fieldscultivated in oats, beans, or turnips, for the support of cattle of any kind.Little land is taken up for roads, which are few and narrow, the chiefcommunication being by water. There are no commons, or lands suffered to liewaste by the neglect, or the caprice, or for the sport, of great proprietors. Noarable land lies fallow. The soil, under a hot and fertilizing sun, yieldsannually, in most instances, double crops, in consequence of adapting theculture to the soil, and of supplying its defects by mixture with other earths,by manure, by irrigation, and by careful and judicious industry of every kind.The labour of man is little diverted from that industry, to minister to theluxuries of the opulent and powerful, or in employments of no real use. Even thesoldiers of the Chinese army, except during the short intervals of the guardswhich they are called upon to mount, or the exercises, or other other occasionalservices, which they perform, are mostly employed in agriculture. The quantityof subsistence is increased also by converting more species of animals andvegetables to that purpose, than is usual in other countries.14[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_557]This account, which is given by Sir George Staunton, is confirmed by Duhalde,and the other Jesuits, who agree in describing the persevering industry of theChinese, in manuring, cultivating, and watering their lands, and their successin producing a prodigious quantity of human subsistence.15[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_555] The effect of such a system ofagriculture on population must be obvious.Lastly, The extraordinary encouragements that have been given to marriage, whichhave caused the immense produce of the country to be divided into very smallshares, and have consequently rendered China more populous in proportion to itsmeans of subsistence, than perhaps any other country in the world.The Chinese acknowledge two ends in marriage;16[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_553] the first is, that ofperpetuating the sacrifices in the temple of their fathers; and the second, themultiplication of the species. Duhalde says, that the veneration and submissionof children to parents, which is the grand principle of their politicalgovernment, continues even after death, and that the same duties are paid tothem as if they were living. In consequence of these maxims, a father feels somesort of dishonour, and is not easy in his mind, if he do not marry off all hischildren; and an elder brother, though he inherit nothing from his father, mustbring up the younger children, and marry them, lest the family should becomeextinct, and the ancestors be deprived of the honours and duties they areentitled to from their descendants.17[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_563]Sir George Staunton observes, that whatever is strongly recommended, andgenerally practised, is at length considered as a kind of religious duty, andthat the marriage union, as such, takes place in China, wherever there is theleast prospect of subsistence for a future family. This prospect, however, isnot always realized, and the children are then abandoned by the wretched authorsof their being;18 [26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2029] but eventhis permission given to parents thus to expose their offspring, tendsundoubtedly to facilitate marriage, and encourage population. Contemplating thisextreme resource beforehand, less fears are entertained of entering into themarried state, and the parental feelings will always step forwards to prevent arecurrence to it, except under the most dire necessity. Marriage with the pooris, besides, a measure of prudence, because the children, particularly the sons,are bound to maintain their parents.19[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_561]The effect of these encouragements to marriage among the rich, is to subdivideproperty, which has in itself a strong tendency to promote population. In China,there is less inequality in the fortunes than in the conditions of men. Propertyin land has been divided into very moderate parcels, by the successivedistribution of the possessions of every father equally among his sons. It wouldrarely happen that there was but one son to enjoy the whole property of hisdeceased parents; and, from the general prevalence of early marriages, thisproperty would not often be increased by collateral succession.20[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2031] These causes constantly tendto level wealth, and few succeed to such an accumulation of it, as to renderthem independent of any efforts of their own for its increase. It is a commonremark among the Chinese, that fortunes seldom continue considerable in the samefamily beyond the third generation.21[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_559]The effect of the encouragements to marriage on the poor, is to keep the rewardof labour as low as possible, and consequently to press them down to the mostabject state of poverty. Sir George Staunton observes, that the price of labouris generally found to bear as small a proportion every where to the ratedemanded for provisions as the common people can suffer; and thatnotwithstanding the advantage of living together in large families, likesoldiers in a mess, and the exercise of the greatest economy in the managementof these messes, they are reduced to the use of vegetable food, with a very rareand scanty relish of any animal substance.22[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_567]Duhalde, after describing the painful industry of the Chinese, and the shiftsand contrivances, unknown in other countries, to which they have recourse inorder to gain a subsistence, says, “yet it must be owned, that notwithstandingthe great sobriety and industry of the inhabitants of China, the prodigiousnumber of them occasions a great deal of misery. “There are some so poor, thatbeing unable to supply their children with common necessaries, they expose themin the streets.”****“In the great cities, such as Pekin and Canton, thisshocking sight is very common.”23[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2033]The Jesuit Premare, writing to a friend of the same society, says, “I will tellyou a fact, which may appear to be a paradox,24[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_565] but is nevertheless strictlytrue. It is, that the richest and most flourishing empire of the world, is,notwithstanding, in one sense, the poorest and the most miserable of all. Thecountry, however extensive and fertile it may be, is not sufficient to supportits inhabitants. Four times as much territory would be necessary to place themat their ease. In Canton alone, there is, without exaggeration, more than amillion of souls, and in a town three or four leagues distant, a still greaternumber. Who then can count the inhabitants of this province? But what is this tothe whole empire, which contains fifteen great provinces all equally peopled. Tohow many millions would such a calculation amount. A third part of this infinitepopulation would hardly find sufficient rice to support itself properly.”“It is well known that extreme misery impels people to the most dreadfulexcesses. A spectator in China, who examines things closely, will not besurprised that mothers destroy, or expose, many of their children; that parentssell their daughters for a trifle; that the people should be interested; andthat there should be such a number of robbers. The surprise is, that nothingstill more dreadful should happen, and that, in the times of famines, which arehere but too frequent, millions of people should perish with hunger, withouthaving recourse to those dreadful extremities, of which we read examples in thehistories of Europe.”“It cannot be said in China, as in Europe, that the poor are idle, and mightgain a subsistence if they would work. The labours and efforts of these poorpeople are beyond conception. A Chinese will pass whole days in digging theearth, sometimes up to his knees in water, and in the evening is happy to eat alittle spoonful of rice, and to drink the insipid water in which it was boiled.This is all that they have in general.”25[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_573]A great part of this account is repeated in Duhalde, and, even allowing for someexaggeration, it shews, in a strong point of view, to what degree population hasbeen forced in China, and the wretchedness which has been the consequence of it.The population which has arisen naturally from the fertility of the soil, andthe encouragements to agriculture, may be considered as genuine and desireable;but all that has been added by the encouragements to marriage, has not only beenan addition of so much pure misery in itself, but has completely interrupted thehappiness which the rest might have enjoyed.The territory of China is estimated at about eight times the territory ofFrance.26 [26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_571] Taking thepopulation of France only at 26 millions, eight times that number will give208,000,000; and when the three powerful causes of population, which have beenstated, are considered, it will not appear incredible, that the population ofChina should be to the population of France, according to their respectivesuperficies, as 333 to 208, or a little more than 3 to 2.The natural tendency to increase is every where so great, that it will generallybe easy to account for the height at which the population is found in anycountry. The more difficult, as well as the more interesting part of theinquiry, is to trace the immediate causes which stop its further progress. Theprocreative power would, with as much facility, double, in twenty-five years,the population of China, as that of any of the states of America; but we knowthat it cannot do this, from the palpable inability of the soil to support suchan additional number. What then becomes of this mighty power in China? and whatare the kinds of restraint, and the forms of premature death, which keep thepopulation down to the level of the means of subsistence?Notwithstanding the extraordinary encouragements to marriage in China, we shouldperhaps be led into an error, if we were to suppose that the preventive check topopulation does not operate. Duhalde says, that the number of bonzas isconsiderably above a million, of which there are two thousand unmarried, atPekin, besides three hundred and fifty thousand more in their templesestablished in different places by the emperor’s patents, and that the literarybachelors alone are about ninety thousand.27[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_569]The poor, though they would probably always marry when the slightest prospectopened to them of being able to support a family, and, from the permission ofinfanticide, would run great risks in this respect; yet they would undoubtedlybe deterred from entering into this state under the certainty of being obligedto expose all their children, or to sell themselves and families as slaves; andfrom the extreme poverty of the lower classes of people, such a certainty wouldoften present itself. But it is among the slaves themselves, of which, accordingto Duhalde, the misery in China produces a prodigious multitude, that thepreventive check to population principally operates. A man sometimes sells hisson, and even himself and wife, at a very moderate price. The common mode is, tomortgage themselves with a condition of redemption, and a great number of menand maid servants are thus bound in a family.28[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_577] Hume, in speaking of thepractice of slavery among the ancients, remarks very justly, that it willgenerally be cheaper to buy a full grown slave, than to rear up one from achild. This observation appears to be particularly applicable to the Chinese.All writers agree in mentioning the frequency of the dearths in China, and,during these periods, it is probable that slaves would be sold in great numbersfor little more than a bare maintenance. It could very rarely therefore answerto the master of a family to encourage his slaves to breed; and we may suppose,in consequence, that a great part of the servants in China, as in Europe, remainunmarried.The check to population arising from a vicious intercourse with the sex, doesnot appear to be very considerable in China. The women are said to be modest andreserved, and adultery is rare. Concubinage is however generally practised, and,in the large towns, publick women are registered; but their number is not great,being proportioned, according to Sir George Staunton, to the small number ofunmarried persons, and of husbands absent from their families.29[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_575]The positive checks to population from disease, though considerable, do notappear to be so great as might be expected. The climate is in general extremelyhealthy. One of the missionaries goes so far as to say, that plagues, orepidemic disorders, are not seen once in a century;30[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2035] but this is undoubtedly anerror, as they are mentioned by others, as if they were by no means soinfrequent. In some instructions to mandarins relating to the burying of thepoor, who have in general no regular places of sepulture, it is observed, that,when epidemic diseases prevail, the roads are found covered with bodiessufficient to infect the air to a great distance;31[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_579] and the expression of years ofcontagion,32 [26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2037] occurs soonafter, in a manner which seems to imply that they are not uncommon. On the firstand fifteenth day of every month, the mandarins assemble, and give their peoplea long discourse, wherein every governor acts the part of a father who instructshis family.33 [26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2039] In one of thesediscourses which Duhalde produces, the following passage occurs: “Beware ofthose years which happen from time to time, when epidemic distempers, joined toa scarcity of corn, make all places desolate. Your duty is then to havecompassion on your fellow citizens, and assist them with whatever you canspare.”34 [26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2041]It is probable that the epidemics, as is usually the case, fall severely on thechildren. One of the Jesuits, speaking of the number of infants whom the povertyof their parents condemns to death the moment that they are born, writes thus:“There is seldom a year in which the churches at Pekin do not reckon five or sixthousand of these children purified by the waters of baptism. This harvest ismore or less abundant according to the number of catechists which we canmaintain. If we had a sufficient number, their cares need not be confined aloneto the dying infants that are exposed. There would be other occasions for themto exercise their zeal, particularly at certain times of the year, when thesmall-pox, or epidemic disorders, carry off an incrèdible number of children.”35[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2043] It is indeed almostimpossible to suppose, that the extreme indigence of the lower classes ofpeople, should not produce diseases, that would be fatal to a considerable partof those children, whom their parents might attempt to rear in spite of everydifficulty.Respecting the number of infants which are actually exposed, it would bedifficult to form the slightest guess; but, if we believe the Chinese writersthemselves, the practice must be very common. Attempts have been made atdifferent times by the government to put a stop to it, but always withoutsuccess. In a book of instructions before alluded to, written by a mandarincelebrated for his humanity and wisdom, a proposal is made for the establishmentof a foundling hospital in his district, and an account is given of some antientestablishments of the same kind,36[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2045] which appear to have falleninto disuse. In this book, the frequency of the exposure of children, and thedreadful poverty which prompts it, are particularly described. We see, he says,people so poor, that they cannot furnish the nourishment necessary for their ownchildren. It is on this account that they expose so great a number. In themetropolis, in the capitals of the provinces, and in the places of the greatestcommerce, their number is the most considerable; but many are found in partsthat are less frequented, and even in the country. As the houses in towns aremore crowded together, the practice is more obvious; but every where these poorunfortunate infants have need of assistance.37[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_583]In the same work, part of an edict to prevent the drowning of children, runsthus: “When the tender offspring just produced, is thrown without pity into thewaves, can it be said, that the mother has given, or that the child has receivedlife, when it is lost as soon as it is begun to be enjoyed? The poverty of theparents is the cause of this crime. They have hardly enough to supportthemselves, much less are they able to pay a nurse, and provide for the expencesnecessary for the support of their children. This drives them to despair, andnot being able to bring themselves to suffer two people to die that one maylive, the mother, to preserve the life of her husband, consents to sacrifice herchild. It costs much, however, to the parental feelings; but the resolution isultimately taken, and they think that they are justified in disposing of thelife of their child to prolong their own. If they exposed their children in asecret place, the babe might work upon their compassion with its cries. What dothey do then? They throw it into the current of the river, that they may losesight of it immediately, and take from it at once all chance of life.”38[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2047]Such writings appear to be most authentick documents respecting the generalprevalence of infanticide.Sir George Staunton has stated, from the best information which he couldcollect, that the number of children exposed annually at Pekin is about twothousand;39 [26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_581] but it is highlyprobable, that the number varies extremely from year to year, and depends verymuch upon seasons of plenty or seasons of scarcity. After any great epidemic ordestructive famine, the number is probably very small; it is natural that itshould increase gradually on the return to a crowded population, and is, withoutdoubt, the greatest, when an unfavourable season takes place, at a period inwhich the average produce is already insufficient to support the overflowingmultitude.These unfavourable seasons do not appear to be infrequent, and the famines whichfollow them, are perhaps the most powerful of all the positive checks to theChinese population; though at some periods, the checks from wars and internalcommotions have not been inconsiderable.40[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_589] In the annals of the Chinesemonarchs, famines are often mentioned;41[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_587] and it is not probable thatthey would find a place among the most important events and revolutions of theempire, if they were not desolating and destructive to a great degree.One of the Jesuits remarks, that the occasions when the mandarins pretend toshew the greatest compassion for the people are, when they are apprehensive of afailure in the crops, either from drought, from excessive rains, or from someother accident, such as a multitude of locusts, which sometimes overwhelmscertain provinces.42 [26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2049] Thecauses here enumerated, are probably those which principally contribute to thefailure of the harvests in China; and the manner in which they are mentioned,seems to shew that they are not uncommon.Meares speaks of violent hurricanes, by which whole harvests are dissipated, anda famine follows. From a similar cause, he says, accompanied by excessivedrought, a most dreadful dearth prevailed in 1787, throughout all the southernprovinces of China, by which an incredible number of people perished. It was nouncommon thing at Canton, to see the famished wretch breathing his last, whilemothers thought it a duty to destroy their infant children, and the young togive the stroke of fate to the aged, to save them from the agonies of such adilatory death.43 [26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2051]The Jesuit Parennin, writing to a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences, says,“another thing that you can scarcely believe, is, that dearths “should be sofrequent in China;”44 [26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2053] and inthe conclusion of his letter he remarks, that if famine did not, from time totime, thin the immense number of inhabitants which China contains, it would beimpossible for her to live in peace.45[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2055] The causes of these frequentfamines, he endeavours to investigate, and begins by observing, very justly,that, in a time of dearth, China can obtain no assistance from her neighbours,and must necessarily draw the whole of her resources from her own provinces.46[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_585] He then describes the delaysand artifices which often defeat the emperor’s intentions to assist from thepublic granaries those parts of the country which are the most distressed. Whena harvest fails in any province, either from excessive drought, or a suddeninundation, the great mandarins have recourse to the public granaries; but oftenfind them empty, owing to the dishonesty of the inferior mandarins, who have thecharge of them. Examinations and researches are then made, and an unwillingnessprevails to inform the court of such disagreeable intelligence. Memorials arehowever at length presented. These memorials pass through many hands, and do notreach the emperor till after many days. The great officers of state are thenordered to assemble, and to deliberate on the means of relieving the misery ofthe people. Declarations, full of expressions of compassion for the people, arein the mean time published throughout the empire. The resolution of the tribunalis at length made known; but numberless other ceremonies delay its execution;while those who are suffering, have the time to die with hunger before theremedy arrives. Those who do not wait for this last extremity, crawl as well asthey can into other districts, where they hope to get support, but leave thegreatest part of their number dead on the road.47[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_593]If, when a dearth occurs, the court do not make some attempt to relieve thepeople, small parties of plunderers soon collect, and their numbers increase bydegrees, so as to interrupt the tranquillity of the province. On this account,numerous orders are always given, and movements are continually taking place, toamuse the people, till the famine is over; and as the motives to relieve thepeople are generally rather reasons of state, than genuine compassion, it is notprobable that they should be relieved at the time, and in the manner, that theirwants require.48 [26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2057]The last cause of famine, which is mentioned in this investigation, and on whichthe writer lays considerable stress, is the very great consumption of grain inmaking spirits;49 [26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2059] but instating this as a cause of famine, he has evidently fallen into a very grosserror; yet, in the Abbé Grosier’s general description of China, this error hasbeen copied, and the cause above mentioned has been considered as one of thegrand sources of the evil.50 [26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_591]But, in reality, the whole tendency of this cause is in a contrary direction.The consumption of corn in any other way but that of necessary food, checks thepopulation before it arrives at the utmost limits of subsistence; and as thegrain may be withdrawn from this particular use in the time of a scarcity, apublic granary is thus opened, richer, probably, than could have been formed byany other means. When such a consumption has been once established, and hasbecome permanent, its effect is exactly as if a piece of land with all thepeople upon it were removed from the country. The rest of the people wouldcertainly be precisely in the same state as they were before, neither better norworse in years of average plenty; but in a time of dearth the produce of thisland would be returned to them, without the mouths to help them to eat it.China, without her distilleries, would certainly be more populous, but on afailure of the seasons, would have still less resource than she has at present,and as far as the magnitude of the cause would operate, would in consequence bemore subject to famines, and those famines would be more severe.The state of Japan resembles in so many respects that of China, that aparticular consideration of it would lead into too many repetitions. Montesquieuattributes its populousness to the birth of a greater number of females;51[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_597] but the principal cause ofthis populousness is, without doubt, as in China, the persevering industry ofthe natives, directed, as it has always been, principally to agriculture.In reading the preface to Thunberg’s account of Japan, it would seem extremelydifficult to trace the checks to the population of a country, the inhabitants ofwhich are said to live in such happiness and plenty; but the continuation of hisown work contradicts the impression of his preface; and, in the valuable historyof Japan by Kæmpfer, these checks are sufficiently obvious. In the extracts fromtwo historical chronicles published in Japan, which he produces,52[26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_595] a very curious account isgiven of the different mortalities, plagues, famines, bloody wars, and othercauses of destruction which have occurred since the commencement of theserecords. The Japanese are distinguished from the Chinese, in being much morewarlike, seditious, dissolute, and ambitious; and it would appear, fromKæmpfer’s account, that the check to population from infanticide, in China, isbalanced by the greater dissoluteness of manners with regard to the sex, and thegreater frequency of wars and intestine commotions, which prevail in Japan. Withregard to the positive checks to population from disease and famine, the twocountries seem to be nearly on a level.NOTES1 [26_XII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_542].

Book ii."},{"pageContent":"CHAP. XIII.Of the Checks to Population among the Greeks.IT has been generally allowed, and will not indeed admit of a doubt, that themore equal division of property among the Greeks and Romans, in the early periodof their history, and the direction of their industry principally toagriculture, must have tended greatly to encourage population. Agriculture isnot only, as Hume states,1 [27_XIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_599]that species of industry, which is chiefly requisite to the subsistence ofmultitudes, but it is in fact the sole species by which multitudes can exist;and all the numerous arts and manufactures of the modern world, by which suchnumbers appear to be supported, have no tendency whatever to increasepopulation, except as far as they tend to increase the quantity, and tofacilitate the distribution, of the products of agriculture.In countries where, from the operation of particular causes, property in land isdivided into very large shares, these arts and manufactures are absolutelynecessary to the existence of any considerable population. Without them, modernEurope would be unpeopled. But where property is divided into small shares, thesame necessity for them does not appear. The division itself attains immediatelyone great object, that of distribution; and if the demand for men be constant,to fight the battles, and support the power and dignity of the state, we mayeasily conceive that this motive, joined to the natural love of a family, mightbe sufficient to induce each proprietor to cultivate his land to the utmost, inorder that it might support the greatest number descendants.The division of people into small states, during the early periods of Greek andRoman history, gave additional force to this motive. Where the number of freecitizens did not perhaps exceed ten or twenty thousand, each individual wouldnaturally feel the value of his own exertions, and knowing that the state towhich he belonged, situated in the midst of envious and watchful rivals, mustdepend chiefly on its population for its means of defence and safety, would besensible, that in suffering the lands which were allotted to him to lie idle, hewould be deficient in his duty as a citizen. These causes appear to haveproduced a considerable attention to agriculture without the intervention of theartificial wants of mankind to encourage it. Population followed the products ofthe earth wíth more than equal pace; and when the overflowing numbers were nottaken off by the drains of war or disease, they found vent in frequent andrepeated colonization. The necessity of these frequent colonizations, joined tothe smallness of the states, which brought the subject immediately home to everythinking person, could not fail to point out to the legislators and philosophersof these times, the strong tendency of population to increase beyond the meansof subsistence; and they did not, like the statesmen and projectors of moderndays, overlook the consideration of a question which so deeply affects thehappiness and tranquillity of society. However we may justly execrate thebarbarous expedients which they adopted to remove the difficulty, we cannot butgive them some credit for their penetration in seeing it; and in being fullyaware, that, if not considered and obviated, it would be sufficient of itself todestroy their best planned schemes of republican equality and happiness.The power of colonization is necessarily limited, and after the lapse of sometime, it might be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for a country, notparticularly well situated for this purpose, to find a vacant spot proper forthe settlement of its expatriated citizens. It was necessary, therefore, toconsider of other resources besides colonization.It is probable that the practice of infanticide had prevailed from the earliestages in Greece. In the parts of America where it was found to exist, it appearsto have originated from the extreme difficulty of rearing many children in asavage and wandering life, exposed to frequent famines and perpetual wars. Wemay easily conceive that it had a similar origin among the ancestors of theGreeks, or the native inhabitants of the country. And when Solon permitted theexposing of children, it is probable that he only gave the sanction of law to acustom already prevalent.In this permission he had, without doubt, two ends in view. First, that which ismost obvious, the prevention of such an excessive population as would causeuniversal poverty and discontent; and, secondly, that of keeping the populationup to the level of what the territory could support, by removing the terrors oftoo numerous a family and, consequently, the principal obstacle to marriage.From the effect of this practice in China, we have reason to think that it isbetter calculated to attain the latter, than the former purpose. But if thelegislator, either did not see this, or if the barbarous habits of the timesprompted parents invariably to prefer the murder of their children to poverty,the practice would appear to be very particularly calculated to answer both theends in view, and to preserve, as completely and as constantly as the nature ofthe thing would permit, the requisite proportion between the food and thenumbers which were to consume it.On the very great importance of attending to this proportion, and the evils thatmust neccssarily result, of weakness on the one hand, or of poverty on theother, from the deficiency or the excess of population, the Greek politicalwriters strongly insist; and propose in consequence various modes of maintainingthe relative proportion desired.Plato, in the republick which he considers in his books of laws, limits thenumber of free citizens, and of habitations, to five thousand and forty; andthis number he thinks may be preserved, if the father of every family chuse oneout of his sons for his successor to the lot of land which he has possessed, anddisposing of his daughters in marriage according to law, distribute his othersons, if he have any, to be adopted by those citizens who are without children.But if the number of children, upon the whole, be either too great or too few,the magistrate is to take the subject particularly into his consideration, andto contrive so, that the same number of five thousand and forty families shouldstill be maintained. There are many modes, he thinks, of effecting this object.Procreation, when it goes on too fast, may be checked, or when it goes on tooslow, may be encouraged, by the proper distribution of honours and marks ofignominy, and by the admonitions of the elders to prevent or promote itaccording to circumstances.2 [27_XIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_601]In his philosophical republick3[27_XIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_2061] he enters more particularlyinto this subject, and proposes that the most excellent among the men should bejoined in marriage to the most excellent among the women, and the inferiorcitizens matched with the inferior females; and that the offspring of the firstshould be brought up; of the others, not. On certain festivals appointed by thelaws, the young men and women who are betrothed, are to be assembled, and joinedtogether with solemn ceremonies. But the number of marriages is to be determinedby the magistrates, that, taking into consideration the drains from wars,diseases, and other causes, they may preserve, as nearly as possible, such aproportion of citizens as will be neither too numerous nor too few, according tothe resources and demands of the state. The children who are thus born from themost excellent of the citizens are to be carried to certain nurses destined tothis office, inhabiting a separate part of the city; but those which are bornfrom the inferior citizens, and any from the others which are imperfect in theirlimbs, are to be buried in some obscure and unknown place.He next proceeds to consider the proper age for marriage, and determines it tobe twenty for the woman, and thirty for the man. Beginning at twenty, the womanis to bear children for the state till she is forty, and the man is to fulfilhis duty in this respect, from thirty to fifty-five. If a man produce a childinto publick either before or after this period, the action is to be consideredin the same criminal and profane light as if he had produced one without thenuptial ceremonies, and instigated solely by incontinence. The same rule shouldhold, if a man, who is of the proper age for procreation, be connected with awoman who is also of the proper age, but without the ceremony of marriage by themagistrate; he is to be considered as having given to the state a spurious,profane, and incestuous offspring. When both sexes have passed the age assignedfor presenting children to the state, Plato allows a great latitude ofintercourse, but no child is to be brought to light. Should any infant byaccident be born alive, it is to be exposed in the same manner as if the parentscould not support it.4 [27_XIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_603]From these passages it is evident, that Plato fully saw the tendency ofpopulation to increase beyond the means of subsistence. His expedients forchecking it are indeed execrable; but the expedients themselves, and the extentto which they were to be used, shew his conceptions of the magnitude of thedifficulty. Contemplating, as he certainly must do in a small republick, a greatproportional drain of people by wars; if he could still propose to destroy thechildren of all the inferior and less perfect citizens; to destroy also all thatwere born not within the prescibed ages, and with the prescribed forms; to fixthe age of marriage late, and after all to regulate the number of thesemarriages; his experience and his reasonings must have strongly pointed out tohim the great power of the principle of increase, and the necessity of checkingit.Aristotle appears to have seen this necessity still more clearly. He fixes theproper age of marriage at thirty-seven for the men, and eighteen for the women;which must of course condemn a great number of women to celibacy, as there nevercan be so many men of thirty-seven as there are women of eighteen. Yet though hehas fixed the age of marriage for the men at so late a period, he still thinksthat there may be too many children, and proposes that the number allowed toeach marriage should be regulated; and if any woman be pregnant after she hasproduced the prescribed number, that an abortion should be procured before thefœtus has life.The period of procreating children for the state, is to cease with the men atfifty-four or fifty-five, because the offspring of old men, as well as of mentoo young, is imperfect both in body and mind. When both sexes have passed theprescribed age, they are allowed to continue a connexion; but, as in Plato’srepublick, no child which may be the result, is to be brought to light.5[27_XIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_609]In discussing the merits of the republick proposed by Plato in his books oflaws, Aristotle is of opinion, that he has by no means been sufficientlyattentive to the subject of population; and accuses him of inconsistency, inequalizing property without limiting the number of children. The laws on thissubject, Aristotle very justly observes, require to be much more definite andprecise in a state where property is equalized than in others. Under ordinarygovernments an increase of population would only occasion a greater subdivisionof landed property; whereas in such a republick the supernumeraries would bealtogether destitute, because the lands, being reduced to equal, and as it wereelementary, parts, would be incapable of further partition.6[27_XIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_607]He then remarks, that it is necessary, in all cases, to regulate the proportionof children that they may not exceed the proper number. In doing this, deathsand barrenness are of course to be taken into consideration. But, if, as in thegenerality of states, every person be left free to have as many children as hepleases, the necessary consequence must be poverty; and poverty is the mother ofvillany and sedition. On this account Pheidon of Corinth, one of the mostancient writers on the subject of politicks, introduced a regulation directlythe reverse of Plato’s, and limited population without equalizing possessions.7[27_XIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_605]Speaking afterwards of Phaleas of Chalcedon, who proposed as a most salutaryinstitution, to equalize wealth among the citizens, he adverts again to Plato’sregulations respecting property, and observes, that those who would thusregulate the extent of fortunes, ought not to be ignorant that it is absolutelynecessary at the same time to regulate the number of children. For, if childrenmultiply beyond the means of supporting them, the law will necessarily bebroken, and families will be suddenly reduced from opulence to beggary; arevolution always dangerous to publick tranquillity.8[27_XIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_615]It appears from these passages, that Aristotle clearly saw, that the strongtendency of the human race to increase, unless checked by strict and positivelaws, was absolutely fatal to every system founded on equality of property; andthere cannot surely be a stronger argument against any system of this kind, thanthe necessity of such laws as Aristotle himself proposes.From a remark which he afterwards makes respecting Sparta, it appears still moreclearly that he fully understood the principle of population. From theimprovidence of the laws relating to succession, the landed property in Spartahad been engrossed by a few, and the effect was greatly to diminish thepopulousness of the country. To remedy this evil, and to supply men forcontinual wars, the kings preceding Lycurgus had been in the habit ofnaturalizing strangers. It would have been much better, however, according toAristotle, to have increased the number of citizens by a nearer equalization ofproperty. But the law relating to children was directly adverse to thisimprovement. The legislator wishing to have many citizens, had encouraged asmuch as possible the procreation of children. A man who had three sons wasexempted from the night-watch; and he who had four, enjoyed a complete immunityfrom all publick burdens. But it is evident, Aristotle most justly observes,that the birth of a great number of children, the division of the landsremaining the same, would necessarily cause only an accumulation of poverty.9[27_XIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_613]He here seems to see exactly the error, into which many other legislatorsbesides Lycurgus have fallen, and to be fully aware, that, to encourage thebirth of children, without providing properly for their support, is to obtain avery small accession to the population of a country at the expence of a verygreat accession of misery.The legislator of Crete10 [27_XIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_611] aswell as Solon, Pheidon, Plato, and Aristotle, saw the necessity of checkingpopulation in order to prevent general poverty; and, as we must suppose that theopinions of such men, and the laws founded upon them, would have considerableinfluence, it is probable, that the preventive check to increase from latemarriages and other causes, operated to a considerable degree among the freecitizens of Greece.For the positive checks to population, we need not look beyond the wars in whichthese small states were almost continually engaged, though we have an account ofone wasting plague at least, in Athens; and Plato supposes the case of hisrepublick being greatly reduced by disease.11[27_XIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_617] Their wars were not onlyalmost constant, but extremely bloody. In a small army, the whole of which wouldprobably be engaged in close fight, a much greater number in proportion would beslain, than in the large modern armies, a considerable part of which oftenremains untouched;12 [27_XIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_2063] and asall the free citizens of these republicks were generally employed as soldiers inevery war, losses would be felt very severely, and would not appear to be veryeasily repaired.NOTES1 [27_XIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_598].

Hume, Essay xi. p. 451."},{"pageContent":"CHAP. XIV.Of the Checks to Population among the Romans.THE havock made by war in the smaller states of Italy, particularly during thefirst struggles of the Romans for power, seems to have been still greater thanin Greece. Wallace, in his dissertation on the numbers of mankind, afteralluding to the multitudes which fell by the sword in these times, observes, “Onan accurate review of the history of the Italians during this period, we shallwonder how such vast multitudes could be raised as were engaged in thosecontinual wars till Italy was entirely subdued.”1[28_XIV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_621] And Livy expresses his utterastonishment that the Volsei and Æqui, so often as they were conquered, shouldhave been able to bring fresh armies into the field.2[28_XIV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2065] But these wonders willperhaps be sufficiently accounted for, if we suppose, what seems to be highlyprobable, that the constant drains from wars had introduced the habit of givingnearly full scope to the power of population, and that a much greater number ofyouths, in proportion to the whole people, were yearly rising into manhood, andbecoming fit to bear arms, than is usual in other states not similarlycircumstanced. It was, without doubt, the rapid influx of these supplies, whichenabled them, like the ancient Germans, to astonish future historians, byrenovating in so extraordinary a manner their defeated and half-destroyedarmies.Yet there is reason to believe, that the practice of infanticide prevailed inItaly as well as in Greece, from the earliest times. A law of Romulus forbad theexposing of children before they were three years old,3[28_XIV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_619] which implies, that the customof exposing them as soon as they were born had before prevailed. But thispractice was of course never resorted to but when the drains from wars wereinsufficient to make room for the rising generation; and consequently, though itmay be considered as one of the positive checks to the full power of increase,yet, in the actual state of things, it certainly contributed rather to promotethan impede population.Among the Romans themselves, engaged as they were in incessant wars, from thebeginning of their republick to the end of it, many of which were dreadfullydestructive, the positive check to population from this cause alone, must havebeen enormously great. But this cause alone, great as it was, would never haveoccasioned that want of Roman citizens, under the emperors, which promptedAugustus and Trajan to issue laws for the encouragement of marriage and ofchildren, if other causes still more powerful in depopulation had not concurred.When the equality of property, which had formerly prevailed in the Romanterritory, had been destroyed by degrees, and the land had fallen into the handsof a few great proprietors, the citizens who were by this change successivelydeprived of the means of supporting themselves, would naturally have no resourceto prevent them from starving, but that of selling their labour to the rich, asin modern states; but from this resource they were completely cut off by theprodigious number of slaves, which, increasing by constant influx with theincreasing luxury of Rome, filled up every employment both in agriculture andmanufactures. Under such circumstances, so far from being astonished that thenumber of free citizens should decrease, the wonder seems to be, that any shouldexist besides the proprietors. And, in fact, many could not have existed, butfor a strange and preposterous custom, which however, perhaps, the strange andunnatural state of the city required, that of distributing vast quantities ofcorn to the poorer citizens gratis. Two hundred thousand received thisdistribution in Augustus’s time; and it is highly probable that a great part ofthem had little else to depend upon. It is supposed to have been given to everyman of full years; but the quantity was not enough for a family, and too muchfor an individual.4 [28_XIV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_625] It couldnot therefore enable them to increase; and, from the manner in which Plutarchspeaks of the custom of exposing children among the poor,5[28_XIV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2067] there is great reason tobelieve that many were destroyed in spite of the jus trium liberorum. Thepassage in Tacitus in which, speaking of the Germans, he alludes to this customin Rome, seems to point to the same conclusion.6[28_XIV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_623] What effect, indeed, couldsuch a law have among a set of people who appear to have been so completelybarred out from all the means of acquiring a subsistence, except that ofcharity, that they would be scarcely able to support themselves, much less awife and two or three children. If half of the slaves had been sent out of thecountry, and the people had been employed in agriculture and manufactures, theeffect would have been to increase the number of Roman citizens with morecertainty and rapidity than ten thousand laws for the encouragement of children.It is possible that the jus trium liberorum, and the other laws of the sametendency, might have been of some little use among the higher classes of theRoman citizens; and, indeed, from the nature of these laws, consisting as theydid principally of privileges, it would appear that they were directed chieflyto this part of society. But vicious habits of every possible kind, preventiveof population,7 [28_XIV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_629] seem to havebeen so generally prevalent at this period, that no corrective laws could haveany considerable influence. Montesquieu justly observes, that “the corruption ofmanners had destroyed the office of censor, which had been established itself todestroy the corruption of manners; but when the corruption of manners becomesgeneral, censure has no longer any force.”8[28_XIV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_627] Thirty-four years after thepassing of the law of Augustus respecting marriage, the Roman knights demandedits repeal. On separating the married and the unmarried, it appeared that thelatter considerably exceeded in number the former; a strong proof of theinefficacy of the law.9 [28_XIV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2069]In most countries, vicious habits preventive of population appear to be rather aconsequence than a cause of the infrequency of marriage; but in Rome thedepravity of morals seems to have been the direct cause which checked themarriage union, at least among the higher classes. It is impossible to read thespeech of Metellus Numidicus in his censorship without indignation and disgust.“If it were possible,” he says, “entirely to go without wives, we would deliverourselves at once from this evil; but as the laws of nature have so ordered it,that we can neither live happy with them, nor continue the species without them,we ought to have more regard for our lasting security than for our transientpleasures.”10 [28_XIV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2071]Positive laws to encourage marriage and population, enacted on the urgency ofthe occasion, and not mixed with religion, as in China and some other countries,are seldom calculated to answer the end which they aim at, and thereforegenerally indicate ignorance in the legislator who proposes them; but theapparent necessity of them almost invariably indicates a very great degree ofmoral and political depravity in the state; and, in the countries in which theyare most strongly insisted on, not only vicious manners will generally be foundto prevail, but political institutions extremely unfavourable to industry, andconsequently to population.On this account, I cannot but agree with Wallace11[28_XIV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_633] in thinking that Hume waswrong in his supposition that the Roman world was probably the most populousduring the long peace under Trajan and the Antonines.12[28_XIV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2073] We well know that wars do notdepopulate much, while industry continues in vigour; and that peace will notincrease the number of people when they cannot find the means of subsistence.The renewal of the laws relating to marriage under Trajan indicates thecontinued prevalence of vicious habits, and of a languishing industry, and seemsto be inconsistent with the supposition of a great increase of population.It might be said, perhaps, that the vast profusion of slaves would more thanmake up for the want of Roman citizens; but it appears that the labour of theseslaves was not sufficiently directed to agriculture to support a very greatpopulation. Whatever might be the case with some of the provinces, the decay ofagriculture in Italy seems to be generally acknowledged. The pernicious customof importing great quantities of corn to distribute gratis to the people hadgiven it a blow which it never afterwards recovered. Hume observes, that “whenthe Roman authors complain that Italy, which formerly exported corn, becamedependent on all the provinces for its daily bread, they never ascribe thisalteration to the increase of its inhabitants, but to the neglect of tillage andagriculture.”13 [28_XIV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_631] And in anotherplace he says, “All ancient authors tell us, that there was a perpetual flux ofslaves to Italy from the remoter provinces, particularly Syria, Cilicia,Cappadocia, and the Lesser Asia, Thrace, and Egypt; yet the number of people didnot increase in Italy; and writers complain of the continual decay of industryand agriculture.”14 [28_XIV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2075] It seemsbut little probable that the peace under Trajan and the Antonines should havegiven so sudden a turn to the habits of the people as essentially to alter thisstate of things.On the condition of slavery it may be observed, that there cannot be a strongerproof of its unfavourableness, to the propagation of the species in thecountries where it prevails, than the necessity of this continual influx. Thisnecessity forms at once a complete refutation of the observation of Wallace,that the antient slaves were more serviceable in raising up people than theinferior ranks of men in modern times.15[28_XIV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_639] Though it is undoubtedly true,as he observes, that all our labourers do not marry, and that many of theirchildren die, and become sickly and useless through the poverty and negligenceof their parents;16 [28_XIV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_637] yetnotwithstanding these obstacles to increase, there is, perhaps, scarcely aninstance to be produced, where the lower classes of society, in any country, iffree, do not raise up people, fully equal to the demand for their labour.To account for the checks to population which are peculiar to a state ofslavery, and which render a constant recruit of numbers necessary, we must adoptthe comparison of slaves to cattle, which Wallace and Hume have made; Wallace,to shew that it would be the interest of masters to take care of their slavesand rear up their offspring;17[28_XIV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2077] and Hume, to prove that itwould more frequently be the interest of the master to prevent than to encouragetheir breeding.18 [28_XIV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2079] IfWallace’s observation had been just, it is not to be doubted that the slaveswould have kept up their own numbers with ease by procreation; and as it isacknowledged that they did not do this, the truth of Hume’s observation isclearly evinced. “To rear a child in London till he could be serviceable, wouldcost much dearer, than to buy one of the same age from Scotland or Ireland,where he had been raised in a cottage, covered with rags, and fed on oatmeal andpotatoes. Those who had slaves, therefore, in all the richer and more populouscountries, would discourage the pregnancy of the females, and either prevent ordestroy the birth.”19 [28_XIV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2081] It isacknowledged by Wallace, that the male slaves greatly exceeded in number thefemales,20 [28_XIV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2083] which mustnecessarily be an additional obstacle to their increase. It would appear,therefore, that the preventive check to population, must have operated with verygreat force among the Greek and Roman slaves; and as they were often illtreated, fed perhaps scantily, and sometimes great numbers of them confinedtogether in close and unwholesome ergastula, or dungeons,21[28_XIV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_635] it is probable that thepositive checks to population from disease, were also severe, and that whenepidemicks prevailed they would be most destructive in this part of the society.The unfavourableness of slavery to the propagation of the species in the countrywhere it prevails, is not, however, decisive of the question respecting theabsolute population of such a country, or, the greater question, respecting thepopulousness of antient and modern nations. We know that some countries couldafford a great and constant supply of slaves, without being in the smallestdegree depopulated themselves; and if these supplies were poured in, as theyprobably would be, exactly in proportion to the demand for labour in the nationwhich received them, the question respecting the populousness of this nation,would rest precisely on the same grounds as in modern states, and depend uponthe number of people which it could employ and support. Whether the practice ofdomestick slavery, therefore, prevail or not, it may be laid down as a positionnot to be controverted, that, taking a sufficient extent of territory to includewithin it exportation and importation, and allowing some variation for theprevalence of luxury, or of frugal habits, that the population of thesecountries will always be in proportion to the food which the earth is made toproduce. And no cause, physical or moral, unless it operate in an excessive andunusual manner,22 [28_XIV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_643] can have anyconsiderable and permanent effect on the population, except in as far as itinfluences the production and distribution of the means of subsistence.In the controversy concerning the populousness of antient and modern nations,this point has not been sufficiently attended to, and physical and moral causeshave been brought forward on both sides, from which no just inference in favourof either party could be drawn. It seems to have escaped the attention of bothwriters, that the more productive and populous a country is, in its actualstate, the less probably will be its power of obtaining a further increase ofproduce, and consequently the more checks must necessarily be called into actionto keep the population down to the level of this stationary, orslowly-increasing produce. From finding such checks, therefore, in antient ormodern nations, no inference can be drawn against the absolute populousness ofeither. On this account, the prevalence of the small-pox, and of other disordersunknown to the antients, can by no means be considered as an argument againstthe populousness of modern nations, though to these physical causes, bothHume.23 [28_XIV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_641] and Wallace24[28_XIV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1548] allow considerable weight.In the moral causes which they have brought forward, they have fallen into asimilar error. Wallace introduces the positive encouragements to marriage amongthe antients, as one of the principal causes of the superior populousness of theantient world;25 [28_XIV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_645] but thenecessity of positive laws to encourage marriage, certainly rather indicates awant than an abundance of people; and in the instance of Sparta, to which heparticularly refers, it appears from the passage in Aristotle, mentioned in thelast chapter, that the laws to encourage marriage were instituted for theexpress purpose of remedying a marked deficiency of people. In a country with acrowded and overflowing population, a legislator would never think of makingexpress laws to encourage marriage and the procreation of children. Otherarguments of Wallace will be found upon examination to be almost equallyineffectual to his purpose.Some of the causes which Hume produces, are in the same manner unsatisfactory,and rather make against the inference which he has in view than for it. Thenumber of footmen, housemaids, and other persons remaining unmarried in modernstates, he allows to be an argument against their populousness.26[28_XIV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1546] But the contrary inference ofthe two, appears to be the more probable. When the difficulties attending therearing of a family are very great, and consequently, many persons of both sexesremain single, we may naturally enough infer that population is stationary, butby no means that it is not absolutely great; because the difficulty of rearing afamily may arise from the very circumstance of a great absolute population, andthe consequent fullness of all the channels to a livelihood; though the samedifficulty may undoubtedly exist in a thinly-peopled country, which is yetstationary in its population. The number of unmarried persons in proportion tothe whole number, may form some criterion by which we can judge whetherpopulation be increasing, stationary, or decreasing; but will not enable us todetermine any thing respecting absolute populousness. Yet even in thiscriterion, we are liable to be deceived. In some of the southern countries earlymarriages are general, and very few women remain in a state of celibacy, yet thepeople not only do not increase, but the actual number is perhaps small. In thiscase the removal of the preventive check is made up by the excessive force ofthe positive check. The sum of all the positive and preventive checks takentogether, forms undoubtedly the immediate cause which represses population; butwe never can expect to obtain and estimate accurately this sum in any country;and we can certainly draw no safe conclusion from the contemplation of two orthree of these checks taken by themselves, because it so frequently happens,that the excess of one check is balanced by the defect of some other. Causeswhich affect the number of births or deaths, may, or may not, affect the averagepopulation, according to circumstances; but causes which affect the productionand distribution of the means of subsistence must necessarily affect population;and it is therefore only on these causes, besides actual enumerations, on whichwe can with any certainty rely.All the checks to population which have been hitherto considered in the courseof this review of human society, are clearly resolvable into moral restraint,vice, and misery.Of moral restraint, though it might be rash to affirm that it has not had someshare in repressing the natural power of population, yet it must be allowed tohave operated very feebly indeed, compared to the others. Of the preventivecheck, considered generally, and without reference to its producing vice, thoughits effect appears to have been very considerable in the later periods of RomanHistory, and in some few other countries; yet, upon the whole, its operationseems to have been inferior to the positive checks. A large portion of theprocreative power appears to have been called into action, the redundancy fromwhich was checked by violent causes. Among these, war is the most prominent andstriking feature; and after this, may be ranked famines and violent diseases. Inmost of the countries considered, the population seems to have been seldommeasured accurately according to the average and permanent means of subsistence,but generally to have vibrated between the two extremes, and consequently theoscillations between want and plenty, are strongly marked, as we shouldnaturally expect among less civilized nations.NOTES1 [28_XIV__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_620].

I.Of the Checks to Population in Norway.IN reviewing the states of modern Europe, we shall be assisted in our inquiriesby registers of births, deaths, and marriages, which, when they are complete andcorrect, point out to us with some degree of precision, whether the prevailingchecks to population are of the positive, or of the preventive kind. The habitsof most European nations, are of course much alike, owing to the similarity ofthe circumstances in which they are placed; and it is to be expected, therefore,that their tables of mortality should sometimes give the same results. Relying,however, too much upon this occasional coincidence, political calculators havebeen led into the error of supposing, that there is, generally speaking, aninvariable order of mortality in all countries; but it appears, on the contrary,that this order is extremely variable; that it is very different in differentplaces of the same country, and, within certain limits, depends uponcircumstances, which it is in the power of man to alter.Norway, during nearly the whole of the last century, was in a peculiar degreeexempt from the drains of people by war. The climate is remarkably free fromepidemick sicknesses, and, in common years, the mortality is less than in anyother country in Europe, the registers of which are known to be correct.1[30_CHAP__I__Of_the_checks_to_popula.html#id_653] The proportion of the annualdeaths to the whole population, on an average throughout the whole country, isonly as 1 to 48.2 [30_CHAP__I__Of_the_checks_to_popula.html#id_651] Yet thepopulation of Norway never seems to have increased with great rapidity. It hasmade a start within the last ten or fifteen years, but, till that period, itsprogress must have been very slow, as we know that the country was peopled invery early ages, and in 1769 its population was only 723,141.3[30_CHAP__I__Of_the_checks_to_popula.html#id_649]Before we enter upon an examination of its internal economy, we must feelassured, that, as the positive checks to its population have been so small, thepreventive checks must have been proportionably great; and we accordingly findfrom the registers, that the proportion of yearly marriages to the wholepopulation, is as 1 to 130,4 [30_CHAP__I__Of_the_checks_to_popula.html#id_1544]which is a smaller proportion of marriages than appears in the registers of anyother country, except Switzerland.One cause of this small number of marriages is the mode in which the enrolmentsfor the army have been conducted, till within a very few years. Every man inDenmark and Norway born of a farmer or labourer is a soldier.5[30_CHAP__I__Of_the_checks_to_popula.html#id_647] Formerly, the commandingofficer of the district might take these peasants at any age he pleased, and hein general preferred those that were from twenty-five to thirty, to such as wereyounger. After being taken into the service, a man could not marry withoutproducing a certificate signed by the minister of the parish, that he hadsubstance enough to support a wife and family; and even then, it was furthernecessary for him to obtain the permission of the officer. The difficulty, andsometimes the expence, attendant on the obtaining of this certificate andpermission, generally deterred those who were not in very good circumstances,from thinking of marriage till their service of ten years was expired; and asthey might be enrolled at any age under thirty-six, and the officers were apt totake the oldest first, it would often be late in life before they could feelthemselves at liberty to settle.Though the minister of the parish had no legal power to prevent a man frommarrying who was not enrolled for service; yet it appears, that custom had insome degree sanctioned a discretionary power of this kind, and the priest oftenrefused to join a couple together, when the parties had no probable means ofsupporting a family.Every obstacle, however, of this nature, whether arising from law or custom, hasnow been entirely removed. A full liberty is given to marry at any age, withoutleave either of the officer or priest; and in the enrolments for the army, allthose of the age of twenty, are taken first, then all those at twenty-two, andso on till the necessary number is completed.The officers in general disapprove of this change. They say that a youngNorwegian has not arrived at his full strength, and does not make a good soldierat twenty. And many are of opinion, that the peasants will now marry too young,and that more children will be born than the country can support.But, independently of any regulations respecting the military enrolments, thepeculiar state of Norway throws very strong obstacles in the way of earlymarriages. There are no large manufacturing towns to take off the overflowingpopulation of the country; and as each village naturally furnishes from itself asupply of hands more than equal to the demand, a change of place in search ofwork seldom promises any success. Unless, therefore, an opportunity of foreignemigration offer, the Norwegian peasant generally remains in the village inwhich he was born; and as the vacancies in houses and employments must occurvery slowly, owing to the small mortality that takes place, he will often seehimself compelled to wait a considerable time, before he can attain a situationwhich will enable him to rear a family.The Norway farms have in general a certain number of married labourers employedupon them, in proportion to their size, who are called housemen. They receivefrom the farmer a house and a quantity of land nearly sufficient to maintain afamily; in return for which, they are under the obligation of working for him ata low and fixed price whenever they are called upon. Except in the immediateneighbourhood of the towns, and on the seacoast, the vacancy of a place of thiskind, is the only prospect which presents itself of providing for a family. Fromthe small number of people, and the little variety of employment, the subject isbrought distinctly within the view of each individual; and he must feel theabsolute necessity of repressing his inclinations to marriage, till some suchvacancy offer. If, from the plenty of materials, he should be led to build ahouse himself, it could not be expected that the farmer, if he had a sufficientnumber of labourers before, should give him an adequate portion of land with it;and though he would, in general, find employment for three or four months in thesummer, yet there would be little chance of his earning enough to support afamily during the whole year. It is probable, that it was in cases of this kind,where the impatience of the parties prompted them to build, or propose to build,a house themselves, and trust to what they could earn, that the parish priestsexercised the discretionary power of refusing to marry.The young men and women therefore, are obliged to remain with the farmers asunmarried servants, till a houseman’s place becomes vacant: and of theseunmarried servants, there is in every farm, and every gentleman’s family, a muchgreater proportion than the work would seem to require. There is but littledivision of labour in Norway. Almost all the wants of domestick economy aresupplied in each separate household. Not only the common operations of brewing,baking, and washing, are carried on at home, but many families make, or import,their own cheese and butter, kill their own beef and mutton, import their owngrocery stores; and the farmers, and country people, in general, spin their ownflax and wool, and weave their own linen and woollen clothes. In the largesttowns, such as Christiania and Drontheim, there is nothing that can be called amarket. It is extremely difficult to get a joint of fresh meat; and a pound offresh butter is an article not to be purchased, even in the midst of summer.Fairs are held at certain seasons of the year, and stores of all kinds ofprovisions that will keep, are laid in at these times; and if this care beneglected, great inconveniences are suffered, as scarcely any thing is to bebought retail. Persons who make a temporary residence, in the country, or smallmerchants not possessed of farms, complain heavily of this inconvenience; andthe wives of merchants who have large estates say, that the domestick economy ofa Norway family is so extensive and complicated, that the necessarysuperintendence of it requires their whole attention, and that they can find notime for any thing else.It is evident that a system of this kind must require a great number ofservants. It is said besides, that they are not remarkable for diligence, andthat to do the same quantity of work, more are necessary than in othercountries. The consequence is, that in every establishment two or three timesthe number of servants will be found, as in a family, living at the same rate inEngland; and it is not uncommon for a farmer in the country, who, in hisappearance, is not to be distinguished from any of his labourers, to have ahousehold of twenty persons, including his own family.The means of maintenance to a single man are, therefore, much less confined thanto a married man; and under such circumstances, the lower classes of peoplecannot increase much, till the increase of mercantile stock, or the division andimprovement of farms, furnishes a greater quantity of employment for marriedlabourers. In countries more fully peopled this subject is always involved ingreat obscurity. Each man naturally thinks that he has as good a chance offinding employment as his neighbour, and that if he cannot get it in one place,he shall, in some other. He marries, therefore, and trusts to fortune; and theeffect too frequently is, that the redundant population occasioned in thismanner is repressed by the positive checks of poverty and disease. In Norway thesubject is not involved in the same obscurity. The number of additional familieswhich the increasing demand for labour will support, is more distinctly marked.The population is so small, that, even in the towns, it is difficult to fallinto any considerable error on this subject; and in the country, the divisionand improvement of an estate, and the creation of a greater number of housemen’splaces, must be a matter of complete notoriety. If a man can obtain one of theseplaces, he marries, and is able to support a family; if he cannot obtain one, heremains single. A redundant population is thus prevented from taking place,instead of being destroyed after it has taken place.It is not to be doubted, that the general prevalence of the preventive check topopulation, owing to the state of society which has been described, togetherwith the obstacles thrown in the way of early marriages from the enrolments forthe army, have powerfully contributed to place the lower classes of people inNorway in a better situation, than could be expected from the nature of the soiland climate. On the seacoast, where, on account of the hopes of an adequatesupply of food, from fishing, the preventive check does not prevail in the samedegree, the people are very poor and wretched; and, beyond comparison, in aworse state, than the peasants in the interior of the country.The greatest part of the soil in Norway is absolutely incapable of bearing corn,and the climate is subject to the most sudden and fatal changes. There are threenights about the end of August which are particularly distinguished by the nameof iron nights, on account of their sometimes blasting the promise of thefairest crops. On these occasions, the lower classes of people necessarilysuffer; but, as there are scarcely any independent labourers, except thehousemen that have been mentioned, who all keep cattle, the hardship of beingobliged to mix the inner bark of the pine with their bread, is mitigated, by thestores of cheese, of salt butter, of salt meat, salt fish, and bacon, which theywere enabled to lay up for winter provision. The period in which the want ofcorn presses the most severely, is, generally, about two months before harvest;and at this time the cows, of which the poorest housemen have generally two orthree, and many five or six, begin to give milk, which must be a greatassistance to the family, particularly to the younger part of it. In the summerof the year 1799, the Norwegians appeared to wear a face of plenty and content,while their neighbours, the Swedes, were absolutely starving: and I particularlyremarked, that the sons of housemen, and the farmers boys, were fatter, larger,and had better calves to their legs, than boys of the same age and in similarsituations in England.It is also, without doubt, owing to the prevalence of the preventive check topopulation, rather than to any peculiar healthiness of the air, that themortality in Norway is so small. There is nothing in the climate, or the soil,that would lead to the supposition of its being in any extraordinary mannerfavourable to the general health of the inhabitants; but as in every country theprincipal mortality takes place among very young children, the smaller number ofthese in Norway, in proportion to the whole population, will naturally occasiona smaller mortality, than in other countries, supposing the climate to beequally healthy.It may be said, perhaps, and with truth, that one of the principal reasons ofthe small mortality in Norway, is, that the towns are inconsiderable and few,and that few people are employed in unwholesome manufactories. In some of theagricultural villages in England, where the preventive check to population doesnot prevail in the same degree, the mortality is as small as in Norway. But itshould be recollected, that the calculation, in this case, is for thoseparticular villages alone; whereas in Norway the calculation of 1 in 48 is forthe whole country. The redundant population of the villages in England isdisposed of by constant emigrations to the towns, and the deaths of a great partof those that are born in the parish do not appear in the registers. But inNorway all the deaths are within the calculation, and it is clear that if morewere born than the country could support, a great mortality must take place insome form or other. If the people were not destroyed by disease, they would bedestroyed by famine. It is indeed well known that bad and insufficient food willproduce disease and death in the purest air and the finest climate. Supposing,therefore, no great foreign emigration, and no extraordinary increase in theresources of the country, nothing but the more extensive prevalence of thepreventive check to population in Norway could secure to her a smaller mortalitythan in other countries, however pure her air may be, or however healthy theemployments of her people.Norway seems to have been antiently divided into large estates or farms, calledGores; and as, according to the law of succession, all the brothers divide theproperty equally, it is a matter of surprise, and a proof how slowly thepopulation has hitherto increased, that these estates have not been moresubdivided. Many of them are indeed now divided into half gores, and quartergores, and some still lower; but it has in general been the custom, on the deathof the father, for a commission to value the estate at a low rate, and if theeldest son can pay his brothers’ and sisters’6[30_CHAP__I__Of_the_checks_to_popula.html#id_655] shares, according to thisvaluation, by mortgaging his estate, or otherwise, the whole is awarded to him;and the force of habit, and natural indolence, too frequently prompt him toconduct the farm after the manner of his forefathers, with few or no efforts atimprovement.Another great obstacle to the improvement of farms in Norway, is a law which iscalled Odel’s right, by which, any lineal descendant can repurchase an estatewhich had been sold out of the family, by paying the original purchase-money.Formerly, collateral as well as lineal descendants had this power, and the timewas absolutely unlimited, so that the purchaser could never consider himself assecure from claims. Afterwards, the time was limited to twenty years, and, in1771, it was still further limited to ten years, and all the collateral brancheswere excluded. It must, however, be an uninterrupted possession of ten years;for if before the expiration of this term, a person who has a right to claimunder the law, give notice to the possessor that he does not forego his claim,though he is not then in a condition to make the purchase, the possessor isobliged to wait six years more before he is perfectly secure. And as, inaddition to this, the eldest in the lineal descent may reclaim an estate thathas been repurchased by a younger brother, the law, even in its present amendedstate, must be considered as a very great bar to improvement; and in its formerstate when the time was unlimited, and the sale of estates in this way was morefrequent, it seems as if it must have been a most complete obstacle to theamelioration of farms, and obviously accounts for the very slow increase of thepopulation in Norway for many centuries.A further difficulty in the way of clearing and cultivating the land, arisesfrom the fears of the great timber merchants respecting the woods. When a farmhas been divided among children and grandchildren, as each proprietor has acertain right in the woods, each, in general, endeavours to cut as much as hecan; and the timber is thus felled before it is fit, and the woods spoiled. Toprevent this, the merchants buy large tracts of woods of the farmers, who enterinto a contract, that the farm shall not be any further subdivided or morehousemen placed upon it; at least, that if the number of families be increased,they should have no right in the woods. It is said, that the merchants who makethese purchases are not very strict, provided the smaller farmers and housemendo not take timber for their houses. The farmers who fell these tracts of woodare obliged by law to reserve to themselves the right of pasturing their cattle,and of cutting timber sufficient for their houses, repairs, and firing.A piece of ground round a houseman’s dwelling cannot be inclosed forcultivation, without an application, first, to the proprietor of the woods,declaring that the spot is not fit for timber, and afterwards to a magistrate ofthe district, whose leave on this occasion is also necessary, probably for thepurpose of ascertaining whether the leave of the proprietor had been dulyobtained.In addition to these obstacles to improved cultivation, which may be consideredas artificial, the nature of the country presents an insuperable obstacle to acultivation and population in any respect proportioned to the surface of thesoil. The Norwegians, though not in a nomadic state, are still in a considerabledegree in the pastoral state, and depend very much upon their cattle. The highgrounds that border on the mountains, are absolutely unfit to bear corn, and theonly use to which they can be put, is to pasture cattle upon them for three orfour months during the summer. The farmers, accordingly, send all their cattleto these grounds at this time of the year, under the care of a part of theirfamilies; and it is here that they make all their butter and cheese for sale, orfor their own consumption. The great difficulty is to support their cattleduring the long winter, and for this purpose, it is necessary that aconsiderable proportion of the most fertile land in the vallies should be mowedfor grass. If too much of it were taken into tillage, the number of cattle mustbe proportionably diminished, and the greatest part of the higher grounds wouldbecome absolutely useless; and it might be a question, in that case, whether thecountry, upon the whole, would support a greater population.Notwithstanding, however, all these obstacles, there is a very considerablecapacity of improvement in Norway, and of late years it has been called intoaction. I heard it remarked by a professor at Copenhagen, that the reason whythe agriculture of Norway had advanced so slowly, was, that there were nogentlemen farmers who might set examples of improved cultivation, and break theroutine of ignorance and prejudice in the conduct of farms, that had been handeddown from father to son for successive ages. From what I saw of Norway, I shouldsay that this want is now, in some degree, supplied. Many intelligent merchantsand well-informed general officers are at present engaged in farming. In thecountry round Christiania, very great improvements have taken place in thesystem of agriculture; and even in the neighbourhood of Drontheim the culture ofartificial grasses has been introduced, which, in a country where so much winterfeed is necessary for cattle, is a point of the highest importance. Almost everywhere the cultivation of potatoes has succeeded, and they are growing more andmore into general use, though in the distant parts of the country they are notyet relished by the common people.It has been more the custom of late years, than formerly, to divide farms; and,as the vent for commodities in Norway is not perhaps sufficient to encourage thecomplete cultivation of large farms, this division of them has probablycontributed to the improvement of the land. It seems, indeed, to be universallyagreed, among those who are in a situation to be competent judges, that theagriculture of Norway in general has advanced considerably of late years; andthe registers shew that the population has followed with more than equal pace.On an average of ten years, from 1775 to 1784, the proportion of births todeaths was 141 to 100.7 [30_CHAP__I__Of_the_checks_to_popula.html#id_659] Butthis seems to have been rather too rapid an increase; as the following year,1785, was a year of scarcity and sickness, in which the deaths considerablyexceeded the births; and for four years afterwards, particularly in 1789, theexcess of births was not great. But in the five years from 1789 to 1794, theproportion of births to deaths was nearly 150 to 100.8[30_CHAP__I__Of_the_checks_to_popula.html#id_657]Many of the most thinking and best informed persons express their apprehensionson this subject, and on the probable result of the new regulations respectingthe enrolments for the army, and the apparent intention of the court of Denmarkto encourage, at all events, the population. No very unfavourable season hasoccurred in Norway since 1785; but it is feared that, in the event of such aseason, the most severe distress might be felt from the increased population.Norway is, I believe, almost the only country in Europe where a traveller willhear any apprehensions expressed of a redundant population, and where the dangerto the happiness of the lower classes of people, from this cause, is, in somedegree, seen and understood. This obviously arises from the smallness of thepopulation altogether, and the consequent narrowness of the subject. If ourattention were confined to one parish, and there were no power of emigratingfrom it, the most careless observer could not fail to remark that if all marriedat twenty, it would be perfectly impossible for the farmers, however carefullythey might improve their land, to find employment and food for those that wouldgrow up; but, when a great number of these parishes are added together in apopulous kingdom, the largeness of the subject, and the power of moving fromplace to place, obscure and confuse our view. We lose sight of a truth whichbefore appeared completely obvious; and, in a most unaccountable manner,attribute to the aggregate quantity of land a power of supporting people beyondcomparison greater than the sum of all its parts.NOTES1 [30_CHAP__I__Of_the_checks_to_popula.html#id_652].

II.Of the Checks to Population in Sweden.SWEDEN is, in many respects, in a state similar to that of Norway. A very largeproportion of its population is, in the same manner, employed in agriculture;and in most parts of the country the married labourers who work for the farmers,like the housemen of Norway, have a certain portion of land for their principalmaintenance, while the young men and women that are unmarried, live as servantsin the farmers’ families. This state of things, however, is not so complete andgeneral, as in Norway; and from this cause, added to the greater extent andpopulation of the country, the superior size of the towns, and the greatervariety of employment, it has not occasioned, in the same degree, the prevalenceof the preventive check to population, and consequently the positive check hasoperated with more force, or the mortality has been greater.According to a paper published by M. Wargentin in the Memoires abrégés del’Academie Royale des Sciences de Stockholm,1[31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_669] the yearly average mortality inall Sweden, for nine years, ending in 1663, was to the population as 1 to34-3/4.2 [31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1542] M. Wargentinfurnished Dr. Price with a continuance of these tables, and an average of 21years gives a result of 1 to 34 3/8, nearly the same.3[31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_667] This is undoubtedly a verygreat mortality, considering the large proportion of the population in Swedenwhich is employed in agriculture. It appears from some calculations inCantzlaer’s account of Sweden, that the inhabitants of the towns are to theinhabitants of the country only as 1 to 13;4[31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_665] whereas, in well-peopledcountries, the proportion is often as 1 to 3, or above.5[31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_663] The superior mortality oftowns, therefore, could not much affect the general proportion in Sweden.The average mortality of villages, according to Susmilch, is 1 in 40.6[31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_661] In Prussia and Pomerania, whichinclude a number of great and unhealthy towns, and where the inhabitants of thetowns are to the inhabitants of the country as 1 to 4, the mortality is lessthan 1 in 37.7 [31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_681] The mortality inNorway, as has been mentioned before, is 1 in 48, which is in a veryextraordinary degree less than in Sweden, though the inhabitants of the towns inNorway bear a greater proportion to the inhabitants of the country than inSweden.8 [31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_679] The towns in Swedenare indeed larger, and more unhealthy, than in Norway; but there is no reason tothink that the country is naturally more unfavourable to the duration of humanlife. The mountains of Norway are in general not habitable. The only peopledparts of the country are the vallies. Many of these vallies are deep and narrowclefts in the mountains; and the cultivated spots in the bottom, surrounded asthey are by almost perpendicular cliffs of a prodigious height,9[31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_677] which intercept the rays of thefun for many hours, do not seem as if they could be so healthy, as the moreexposed and drier soil of Sweden.It is difficult, therefore, entirely to account for the mortality of Sweden,without supposing that, the habits of the people, and the continual cry of thegovernment for an increase of subjects, tend to press the population too hardagainst the limits of subsistence, and, consequently, to produce diseases whichare the necessary effect of poverty and bad nourishment; and this, fromobservation, appears to be really the case.Sweden does not produce food sufficient for its population. Its annual want inthe article of grain, according to a calculation made from the years 1768 and1772, is 440,000 tuns.10 [31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_675] Thisquantity, or near it, has in general been imported from foreign countries,besides pork, butter, and cheese, to a considerable amount.11[31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_673]The distillation of spirits in Sweden is supposed to consume above 400,000 tunsof grain; and when this distillation has been prohibited by government, avariation in defect appears in the tables of importations;12[31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_671] but no great variations inexcess are observable, to supply the deficiencies in years of scanty harvests,which, it is well known, occur frequently. In years the most abundant, when thedistillation has been free, it is asserted, that 388,000 tuns have in generalbeen imported.13 [31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_687] It follows,therefore, that the Swedes consume all the produce of their best years, andnearly 400,000 more; and that, in their worst years, their consumption must bediminished by nearly the whole deficiency in their crops. The mass of the peopleappears to be too poor to purchase nearly the same quantity of corn at a veryadvanced price. There is no adequate encouragement, therefore, to corn merchantsto import in great abundance; and the effect of a deficiency of one fourth, orone third, in the crops, is, to oblige the labourer to content himself withnearly three-fourths or two thirds of the corn which he used before, and tosupply the rest by the use of any substitutes which necessity, the mother ofinvention, may suggest. I have said, nearly, because it is difficult to supposethat the importations should not be something greater in years of scarcity thanin common years, though no marked differences of this kind appear in the tablespublished by Cantzlaer. The greatest importation, according to these tables, wasin the year 1768, when it amounted to 590,265 tuns of grain;14[31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_685] but even this greatestimportation is only 150,000 tuns above the average wants of the country; andwhat is this, to supply a deficiency of one fourth or one third of a crop? Thewhole importation is indeed in this respect trifling.The population of Sweden, at the time that Cantzlaer wrote, was about twomillions and an half.15 [31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_683] Heallows four tuns of grain to a man.16[31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1539] Upon this supposition theannual wants of Sweden would be ten millions of tuns, and four or five hundredthousand would go but a little way in supplying a deficiency of two millions anda half, or three millions; and, if we take only the difference from the averageimportation, it will appear, that the assistance which the Swedes receive fromimportation in a year of scarcity is perfectly futile.The consequence of this state of things is, that the population of Sweden is ina peculiar manner affected by every variation of the seasons; and we cannot besurprised at a very curious and instructive remark of M. Wargentin, that theregisters of Sweden shew, that the population and the mortality increase ordecrease, according as the harvests are abundant or deficient. From the nineyears of which he had given tables, he instances the following.[../img/195_1.png]Here it appears, that in the year 1760 the births were to the deaths as 15 to10; but in the year 1758 only as 11 to 10. By referring to the enumerations ofthe population in 1757 and 1760,18[31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_693] which M. Wargentin has given,it appears, that the number of marriages in the year 1760, in proportion to thewhole population, was as 1 to 101; in the year 1757, only as 1 to about 124. Thedeaths in 1760, were to the whole population as 1 to 39; in 1757 as 1 to 32, andin 1758 as 1 to 31.In making some observations on the tables which had been produced, M. Wargentinsays, that in the unhealthy years about 1 in 29 have died annually, and in thehealthy years 1 in 39; and that, taking a middle term, the average mortalitymight be considered at 1 in 36.19[31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1538] But this inference does notappear to be just, as a mean between 29 and 39 would give 34; and indeed thetables which he has himself brought forward, contradict an average mortality of1 in 36, and prove that it is about 1 in 34-3/4.The proportion of yearly marriages to the whole population, appears to be, on anaverage, nearly as 1 to 112, and to vary between the extremes of 1 to 101, and 1to 124, according to the temporary prospect of a support for a family. Probably,indeed, it varies between much greater extremes, as the period from which thesecalculations are made is merely for nine years.In another paper which M. Wargentin published in the same collection, he againremarks, that in Sweden, the years which are the most fruitful in produce, arethe most fruitful in children.20[31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_691]If accurate observations were made in other countries, it is highly probablethat differences of the same kind would appear, though not to the same extent.21[31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_689] With regard to Sweden, theyclearly prove that its population has a very strong tendency to increase; andthat it is not only always ready to follow with the greatest alertness anyaverage increase in the means of subsistence, but that it makes a start forwardsat every temporary and occasional increase of food, by which means, it iscontinually going beyond the average increase, and is repressed by theperiodical returns of severe want, and the diseases arising from it.Yet notwithstanding this constant and striking tendency to overflowing numbers,strange to say! the government and the political economists of Sweden, arecontinually calling out for population, population. Cantzlaer observes, that thegovernment, not having the power of inducing strangers to settle in the country,or of augmenting at pleasure the number of births, has occupied itself since1748 in every measure which appeared proper to increase the population of thecountry.22 [31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_697] But suppose, thatthe government really possessed the power of inducing strangers to settle, or ofincreasing the number of births at pleasure, what would be the consequence? Ifthe strangers were not such as to introduce a better system of agriculture, theywould either be starved themselves, or cause more of the Swedes to be starved;and if the yearly number of births were considerably increased, it appears to meperfectly clear, from the tables of M. Wargentin, that the principal effectwould be merely an increase of mortality. The actual population might, perhaps,even be diminished by it, as when epidemicks have once been generated by badnourishment and crowded houses, they do not always stop when they have taken offthe redundant population, but take off with it a part, and sometimes a veryconsiderable part, of that which the country might be able properly to support.In all very northern climates, in which the principal business of agriculturemust necessarily be compressed into the small space of a few summer months, itwill almost inevitably happen, that during this period a want of hands is felt;but this temporary want should be carefully distinguished from a real andeffectual demand for labour, which includes the power of giving employment andsupport through the whole year, and not merely for two or three months. Thepopulation of Sweden in the natural course of its increase, will always be readyfully to answer this effectual demand; and a supply beyond it, whether fromstrangers or an additional number of births, could only be productive of misery.It is asserted by Swedish authors, that a given number of men and of days,produces, in Sweden, only a third part of what is produced by the same number ofeach, in some other countries;23[31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_695] and heavy accusations are inconsequence brought against the national industry. Of the general grounds forsuch accusations, a stranger cannot be a competent judge; but in the presentinstance, it appears to me, that more ought to be attributed to the climate andsoil, than to an actual want of industry in the natives. For a large portion ofthe year their exertions are necessarily cramped by the severity of the climate;and during the time when they are able to engage in agricultural operations, thenatural indifference of the soil, and the extent of surface required for a givenproduce, inevitably employ a great proportional quantity of labour. It is wellknown in England, that a farm of large extent consisting of a poor soil, isworked at a much greater expence for the same produce, than a small one of richland. The natural poverty of the soil in Sweden, generally speaking, cannot bedenied.In a journey up the western side of the country, and afterwards in crossing itfrom Norway to Stockholm, and thence up the eastern coast to the passage over toFinland, I confess that I saw fewer marks of a want of national industry than Ishould have expected. As far as I could judge, I very seldom saw any landuncultivated which would have been cultivated in England, and I certainly sawmany spots of land in tillage, which never would have been touched with a ploughhere. These were lands in which, every five or ten yards, there were largestones or rocks, round which the plough must necessarily be turned, or be liftedover them; and the one or the other is generally done according to their size.The plough is very light, and drawn by one horse, and in ploughing among thestumps of the trees when they are low, the general practice is to lift it overthem. The man who holds the plough does this very nimbly, with little or no stopto the horse.Of the value of those lands for tillage, which are at present covered withimmense forests, I could be no judge; but both the Swedes and the Norwegians areaccused of clearing these woods away too precipitately, and without previouslyconsidering what is likely to be the real value of the land when cleared. Theconsequence is, that, for the sake of one good crop of rye, which may always beobtained from the manure afforded by the ashes of the burnt trees, much growingtimber is sometimes spoiled, and the land, perhaps, afterwards, becomes almostentirely useless. After the crop of rye has been obtained, the common practiceis to turn cattle in upon the grass, which may accidentally grow up. If the landbe naturally good, the feeding of the cattle prevents fresh firs from rising;but if it be bad, the cattle of course cannot remain long in it, and the seedswith which every wind is surcharged, sow the ground again thickly with firs.On observing many spots of this kind both in Norway and Sweden, I could not helpbeing struck with the idea, that, though for other reasons, it was very littleprobable, such appearances certainly made it seem possible, that these countriesmight have been better peopled formerly, than at present; and that lands, whichare now covered with forests, might have produced corn a thousand years ago.Wars, plagues, or that greater depopulator than either, a tyrannical government,might have suddenly destroyed, or expelled, the greatest part of theinhabitants, and a neglect of the land for twenty or thirty years in Norway orSweden, would produce a very strange difference in the face of the country. Butthis is merely an idea which I could not help mentioning, but which the readeralready knows has not had weight enough with me, to make me suppose the fact inany degree probable.To return to the agriculture of Sweden. Independently of any deficiency in thenational industry, there are certainly some circumstances in the politicalregulations of the country, which tend to impede the natural progress of itscultivation. There are still some burdensome corvées remaining, which thepossessors of certain lands are obliged to perform for the domains of thecrown.24 [31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_701] The posting of thecountry is undoubtedly very cheap and convenient to the traveller; but isconducted in a manner to occasion a great waste of labour to the farmer, both inmen and horses. It is calculated by the Swedish economists, that the labourwhich would be saved by the abolition of this system alone, would produceannually 300,000 tuns of grain.25[31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2085] The very great distance of themarkets in Sweden, and the very incomplete division of labour which is almost anecessary consequence of it, occasion also a great waste of time and exertion.And, if there be no marked want of diligence and activity among the Swedishpeasants, there is certainly a want of knowledge in the best modes of regulatingthe rotation of their crops, and of manuring and improving their lands.26[31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_699]If the government were employed in removing these impediments, and in endeavoursto encourage and direct the industry of the farmers, and circulate the bestinformation on agricultural subjects, it would do much more for the populationof the country, than by the establishment of five hundred foundling hospitals.According to Cantzlaer, the principal measures in which the government had beenengaged for the encouragement of the population, were, the establishment ofcolleges of medicine, and of lying-in and foundling hospitals.27[31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2087] The establishment of collegesof medicine, for the cure of the poor, gratis, may in many cases be extremelybeneficial, and was so, probably, in the particular circumstances of Sweden; butthe example of the hospitals of France, which have the same object, may create adoubt, whether even such establishments are universally to be recommended.Lying-in hospitals, as far as they have an effect, are probably ratherprejudicial than otherwise, as, according to the principle on which they aregenerally conducted, their tendency is certainly to encourage vice. Foundlinghospitals, whether they attain their professed and immediate object, or not, arein every view hurtful to the state; but the mode in which they operate, I shallhave occasion to discuss more particularly in another chapter.The Swedish government, however, has not been exclusively employed in measuresof this nature. By an edict in 1776, the commerce of grain was renderedcompletely free throughout the whole interior of the country, and, with regardto the province of Scania, which grows more than its consumption, exportationfree of every duty was allowed.28[31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_705] Till this period, theagriculture of the southern provinces had been checked by the want of vent fortheir grain, on account of the difficulty of transport, and the absoluteprohibition of selling it to foreigners at any price. The northern provinces arestill under some little difficulties in this respect, though, as they never growa quantity sufficient for their consumption, these difficulties are not so muchfelt.29 [31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2089] It may be observed,however, in general, that there is no check more fatal to improving cultivation,than any difficulty in the vent of its produce, which prevents the farmer frombeing able to obtain, in good years, a price for his corn, not much below thegeneral average.But what perhaps has contributed more than any other cause to the increasingpopulation of Sweden, is the abolition of a law in 1748, which limited thenumber of persons to each henman, or farm.30[31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_703] The object of this law appearsto have been, to force the children of the proprietors to undertake the clearingand cultivation of fresh lands, by which, it was thought, that the whole countrywould be sooner improved. But it appeared from experience, that these childrenbeing without sufficient funds for such undertakings, were obliged to seek theirfortune in some other way, and great numbers, in consequence, are said to haveemigrated. A father may now, however, not only divide his landed property intoas many shares as he thinks proper; but these divisions are particularlyrecommended by the government, and, considering the immense size of the Swedishhenmans, and the impossibility of their being cultivated completely by onefamily, such divisions must in every point of view be highly useful.The population of Sweden in 1751, was 2,229,661.31[31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2091] In 1799, according to anaccount which I received in Stockholm from professor Nicander, the successor toM. Wargentin, it was 3,043,731. This is a very considerable addition to thepermanent population of the country, which has followed a proportional increasein the produce of the soil, as the imports of corn are not greater than theywere formerly, and there is no reason to think that the condition of the peopleis, on an average, worse.This increase, however, has not gone forwards, without periodical checks, which,if they have not, for the time, entirely stopped its progress, have alwaysretarded the rate of it. How often these checks have recurred during the last 50years, I am not furnished with sufficient data to be able to say, but I canmention some of them. From the paper of M. Wargentin,32[31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_711] already quoted in this chapter,it appears, that the years 1757 and 1758, were barren, and comparatively mortalyears. If we were to judge from the increased importation of 1768,33[31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_709] this would also appear to be anunproductive year. According to the additional tables with which M. Wargentinfurnished Dr. Price, the years 1771, 1772, and 1773, were particularly mortal.34[31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_707] The year 1789 must have beenvery highly so, as, in the accounts which I received from professor Nicander,this year alone materially affected the average proportion of births to deathsfor the twenty years ending in 1795. This proportion, including the year 1789,was 100 to 77; but abstracting it, was 100 to 75; which is a great differencefor one year to make in an average of twenty. To conclude the catalogue, theyear 1799, when I was in Sweden, must have been a very fatal one. In theprovinces bordering on Norway, the peasants called it the worst that they hadever remembered. The cattle had all suffered extremely during the winter, fromthe drought of the preceding year; and, in July, about a month before theharvest, a considerable portion of the people was living upon bread made of theinner bark of the fir, and of dried sorrel, absolutely without any mixture ofmeal, to make it more palatable and nourishing. The sallow looks, and melancholycountenances of the people, betrayed the unwholesomeness of their nourishment.Many had died, but the full effects of such a diet had not then been felt. Theywould probably appear afterwards in the form of some epidemick sickness.The patience with which the lower classes of people in Sweden bear these severepressures, is perfectly astonishing, and can only arise from their being leftentirely to their own resources, and from the belief that they are submitting tothe great law of necessity, and not to the caprices of their rulers. Most of themarried labourers, as has been before observed, cultivate a small portion ofland; and when, from an unfavourable season, their crops fail or their cattledie, they see the cause of their want, and bear it as the visitation ofprovidence. Every man will submit, with becoming patience, to evils which hebelieves to arise from the general laws of nature; but when the vanity andmistaken benevolence of the government and the higher classes of society, have,by a perpetual interference with the concerns of the lower classes, endeavouredto persuade them, that all the good which they enjoy is conferred upon them bytheir rulers and rich benefactors, it is very natural that they should attributeall the evil which they suffer to the same sources, and patience, under suchcircumstances, cannot reasonably be expected. Though to avoid still greaterevils, we may be allowed to repress this impatience by force, if it shew itselfin overt acts, yet the impatience itself appears to be clearly justified in thiscase; and those are in a great degree answerable for its consequences, whoseconduct has tended evidently to encourage it.Though the Swedes had supported the severe dearth of 1799 with extraordinaryresignation; yet afterwards, on an edict of the government to prohibit thedistillation of spirits, it is said that there were considerable commotions inthe country. The measure itself was certainly calculated to benefit the people;and the manner in which it was received, affords a curious proof of thedifferent temper with which people bear an evil, arising from the laws ofnature, or a privation caused by the edicts of a government.The sickly periods in Sweden which have retarded the rate of its increase inpopulation, appear in general to have arisen from the unwholesome nourishmentoccasioned by severe want. And this want has been caused by unfavourable seasonsfalling upon a country which was without any reserved store, either in itsgeneral exports, or in the liberal division of food to the labourer in commonyears, and which was therefore peopled fully up to its produce, before theoccurrence of the scanty harvest. Such a state of things is a clear proof, thatif, as some of the Swedish economists assert, their country ought to have apopulation of nine or ten millions,35[31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_713] they have nothing further todo, than to make it produce food sufficient for such a number, and they may restperfectly assured that they will not want mouths to eat it, without theassistance of lying-in, and foundling hospitals.Notwithstanding the mortal year of 1789, it appeared from the accounts which Ireceived from professor Nicander, that the general healthiness of the countryhad increased. The average mortality for the twenty years ending 1795, was 1 in37, instead of 1 in less than 35, which had been the average of the precedingtwenty years. As the rate of increase had not been accelerated in the twentyyears ending in 1795, the diminished mortality must have been occasioned by theincreased operation of the preventive check. Another calculation which Ireceived from the professor, seemed to confirm this supposition. According toM.Wargentin, as quoted by Susmilch,36[31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_715] standing marriages producedyearly 1 child; but in the latter period, the proportion of standing marriagesto annual births, was as 5-1/10 and subtracting illegitimate children, as 5-3/10to 1; a proof, that in the latter period the marriages had not been quite soearly and so prolifick.NOTES1 [31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_668]. 1 vol. 4to. printed atParis, 1772.2 [31_II__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1541].

The principal road from Christiania to Drontheim leads,for nearly 180 English miles, through a continued valley of this kind, by theside of a very fine river, which in one part stretches out into the extensivelake Miosen. I am inclined to believe that there is not any river in all Europe,the course of which, affords such a constant succession of beautiful andromantic scenery.

III.Of the Checks to Population in Russia.THE lists of births, deaths, and marriages, in Russia, present suchextraordinary results, that it is impossible not to receive them with aconsiderable degree of suspicion; at the same time, the regular manner in whichthey have been collected, and their agreement with each other in differentyears, entitle them to attention.In a paper presented in 1786, by B. F. Herman, to the academy of Petersburgh,and published in the Nova Acta Academiœ, tom. iv. a comparison is made of thebirths, deaths, and marriages, in the different provinces and towns of theempire, and the following proportions are given:[../img/203_1.png]Some of these proportions, it will be observed, are extraordinarily high. InVeronesch, for instance, the births are to the deaths, nearly as 3 to 1, whichis as great a proportion, I believe, as ever was known in America. The averageresult, however, of these proportions, has been confirmed by subsequentobservations. Mr. Tooke, in his View of the Russian Empire, makes the generalproportion of births to burials throughout the whole country, as 225 to 100,1[32_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_717] which is 2 and to 1; and thisproportion is taken from the lists of 1793.2[32_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2093]From the number of yearly marriages, and yearly births, M. Herman draws thefollowing conclusions:[../img/204_1.png]M. Herman observes, that the fruitfulness of marriages in Russia, does notexceed that of other countries, though the mortality is much less; as appearsfrom the following proportions, drawn from a rough calculation of the number ofinhabitants in each government:[../img/204_2.png]It may be concluded, M. Herman says, that in the greatest number of the Russianprovinces, the yearly mortality is 1 in 60.3[32_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_719]This average number is so high, and some of the proportions in the particularprovinces are so extraordinary, that it is almost impossible to believe themaccurate. They have been nearly confirmed, however, by subsequent lists, which,according to Mr. Tooke, make the general mortality in all Russia, 1 in 58.4[32_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_723] But Mr. Tooke himself seems todoubt the accuracy of this particular department of the registers; and I havesince heard from good authority, that there is reason to believe, that theomissions in the burials are in all the provinces much greater than theomissions in the births, and consequently, that the very great excess of births,and very small mortality, are more apparent than real. It is supposed that manychildren, particularly in the Ukraine, are privately interred by their fatherswithout information to the priest. The numerous and repeated levies of recruitstake off great numbers whose deaths are not recorded. From the frequentemigrations of whole families to different parts of the empire, and thetransportation of malefactors to Siberia, great numbers necessarily die onjournies, or in parts where no regular lists are kept; and some omissions areattributed to the neglect of the parish priests who have an interest inrecording the births, but not the deaths.To these reasons I should add, that the population of each province, is probablyestimated by the number of boors belonging to each estate in it; but it is wellknown that a great part of them has leave to reside in the towns. Their births,therefore, appear in the province, but their deaths do not. The apparentmortality of the towns is not proportionably increased by this emigration,because it is estimated according to actual enumeration. The bills of mortalityin the towns express correctly the numbers dying out of a certain number knownto be actually present in these towns; but the bills of mortality in theprovinces, purporting to express the numbers dying out of the estimatedpopulation of the province, do really only express the numbers dying out of amuch smaller population, because a considerable part of the estimated populationis absent.In Petersburgh, it appeared by an enumeration in 1784, that the number of maleswas 126,827, and of females only 65,619.5[32_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_721] The proportion of males wastherefore very nearly double, arising from the numbers who came to the town, toearn their capitation tax, leaving their families in the country, and from thecustom among the lords, of retaining a prodigious number of their boors ashousehold servants, in Petersburgh and Moscow.The number of births in proportion to the whole population in Russia, is notdifferent from a common average in other countries, being about 1 in 26.6[32_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_733]According to the paper of M. Herman, already quoted, the proportion of boysdying within the first year, is, at Petersburgh, 1/5. In the government ofTobolsk 1/10. In the town of Tobolsk 1/5. In Vologda 1/14. In Novogorod 1/31. InVeronesch 1/24. In Archangel 1/5. The very small mortality of infants in some ofthese provinces, particularly, as the calculation does not seem to be liable tomuch error, makes the smallness of the general mortality more credible. InSweden, throughout the whole country, the proportion of infants which dieswithin the first year, is 1/5 or more.7[32_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_731]The proportion of yearly marriages in Russia to the whole population, is,according to M. Herman, in the towns, about 1 in 100, and in the provinces about1 in 70 or 80. According to Mr. Tooke, in the fifteen governments of which hehad lists, the proportion was 1 in 92.8[32_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_729] This is not very differentfrom other countries. In Petersburgh, indeed, the proportion was 1 in 140;9[32_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_727] but this is clearly accountedfor, by what has already been said of the extraordinary number of the males incomparison of the females.The registers for the city of Petersburgh are supposed to be such as can beentirely depended upon; and these tend to prove the general salubrity of theclimate. But there is one fact recorded in them, which is directly contrary towhat has been observed in all other countries. This is a much greater mortalityof female children than of male. In the period from 1781 to 1785, of 1000 boysborn, 147 only, died within the first year, but of the same number of girls310.10 [32_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_725] The proportion is as 10to 21, which is inconceivable, and must indeed have been, in some measure,accidental, as, in the preceding periods, the proportion was only as 10 to 14;but even this is very extraordinary, as it has been generally remarked, that, inevery stage of life, except during the period of childbearing, the mortalityamong females is less than among males. The climate of Sweden does not appear tobe very different from that of Russia; and M. Wargentin observes, with respectto the Swedish tables, that it appears from them, that the smaller mortality offemales, is not merely owing to a more regular and less laborious life, but is anatural law which operates constantly from infancy to old age.11[32_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2095]According to M. Krafft,12 [32_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_741] thehalf of all that are born in Petersburgh, live to 25; which shews a degree ofhealthiness in early life very unusual for so large a town; but after twenty, amortality, much greater than in any other town in Europe, takes place, which isjustly attributed to the immoderate use of brandy.13[32_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_739] The mortality between 10 and15 is so small, that only 1 in 47 males, and 1 in 29 females, die. From 20 to25, the mortality is so great, that 1 in 9 males, and 1 in 13 females, die. Thetables shew, that this extraordinary mortality is occasioned principally bypleuresies, high fevers, and consumptions. Pleuresies destroy 1/4, high fevers1/3, and consumptions 1/6, of the whole population. The three together take offof all that die.The general mortality during the period from 1781 to 1785, was, according to M.Krafft, 1 in 37. In a former period, it has been 1 in 35, and in a subsequentperiod, when epidemick diseases prevailed, 1 in 29.14[32_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_737] This average mortality issmall for a large town; but there is reason to think, from a passage in M.Krafft’s memoir,15 [32_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_735] that thedeaths in the hospitals, the prisons, and in the maison des Enfans trouvés, areeither entirely omitted, or not given with correctness; and undoubtedly, theinsertion of these deaths might make a great difference in the apparenthealthiness of the town.In the maison des Enfans trouvés alone, the mortality is prodigious. No regularlists are published, and verbal communications are always liable to someuncertainty. I cannot, therefore, rely upon the information which I collected onthe subject; but, from the most careful inquiries which I could make of theattendants at the house in Petersburgh, I understood that 100 a month was thecommon average. In the preceding winter, which was the winter of 1788, it hadnot been uncommon to bury 18 a day. The average number received in the day, isabout 10; and though they are all sent into the country to be nursed three daysafter they have been in the house, yet, as many of them are brought in a dyingstate, the mortality must necessarily be great. The number said to be received,appears, indeed, almost incredible; but, from what I saw myself, I should beinclined to believe, that both this and the mortality before mentioned, mightnot be far from the truth. I was at the house about noon, and four children hadbeen just received, one of which was evidently dying, and another did not seemas if it would long survive.A part of the house is destined to the purpose of a lying-in hospital, whereevery woman that comes is received, and no questions are asked. The childrenwhich are thus born, are brought up by nurses in the house, and are not sentinto the country like the others. A mother, if she chuse it, may perform theoffice of nurse to her own child, in the house, but is not permitted to take itaway with her. A child brought to the house, may at any time be reclaimed by itsparents, if they can prove themselves able to support it; and all the childrenare marked and numbered on being received, that they may be known and producedto the parents, when required, who, if they cannot reclaim them, are permittedto visit them.The country nurses receive only two roubles a month, which, as the current paperrouble is seldom worth more than half a crown, is only about fifteen pence aweek; yet, the general expences are said to be 100,000 roubles a month. Theregular revenues belonging to the institution are not nearly equal to this sum;but the government takes on itself the management of the whole affair, andconsequently bears all the additional expences. As the children are receivedwithout any limit, it is absolutely necessary, that the expences should also beunlimited. It is evident that the most dreadful evils must result from anunlimited reception of children, and only a limited fund to support them. Suchinstitutions, therefore, if managed properly, that is, if the extraordinarymortality do not prevent the rapid accumulation of expence, cannot exist longexcept under the protection of a very rich government; and even under suchprotection there must ultimately be a limit.At six or seven years old the children who have been sent into the country,return to the house, where they are taught all sorts of trades, and manualoperations. The common hours of working are, from 6 to 12, and from 2 till 4.The girls leave the house at 18, and the boys at 20 or 21. When the house is toofull, some of those which have been sent into the country are not brought back.The principal mortality, of course, takes place among the infants who are justreceived, and the children which are brought up in the house; but there is aconsiderable mortality among those which are returned from the country, and arein the firmest stages of life. I was, in some degree, surprised at hearing this,after having been particularly struck with the extraordinary degree of neatness,cleanliness, and sweetness, which appeared to prevail in every department. Thehouse itself had been a palace, and all the rooms were large, airy, and evenelegant. I was present while 180 boys were dining. They were all dressed veryneatly; the table-cloth was clean, and each had a separate napkin to himself.The provisions appeared to be extremely good, and there was not the smallestdisagreeable smell in the room. In the dormitories there was a separate bed foreach child; the bedsteads were of iron without tester or curtains, and thecoverlids and sheets particularly clean.This degree of neatness, almost inconceivable in a large institution, was to beattributed principally to the present empress dowager, who interested herself inall the details of the management; and, when at Petersburgh, seldom passed aweek without inspecting them in person. The mortality which takes place in spiteof all these attentions, is a clear proof, that the constitution, in earlyyouth, cannot support confinement and work for 8 hours in the day. The childrenhad all rather a pale and sickly countenance, and if a judgment had been formedof the national beauty from the girls and boys in this establishment, it wouldhave been most unfavourable.It is evident, that if the deaths belonging to this institution be omitted, thebills of mortality for Petersburgh cannot give a representation, in any degreenear the truth, of the real state of the city, with respect to healthiness. Atthe same time, it should be recollected, that some of the observations whichattest its healthiness, such as the number dying in a thousand, &c. are notinfluenced by this circumstance; unless indeed we say, what is perhaps true,that nearly all those who would find any difficulty in rearing their children,send them to the foundling hospital, and the mortality among the children ofthose who are in easy circumstances, and live in comfortable houses, and airysituations, will of course be much less than a general average taken from allthat are born.The maison des Enfans trouvés, at Moscow, is conducted exactly upon the sameprinciples as that at Petersburgh; and Mr. Tooke gives an account of thesurprising loss of children which it had sustained in twenty years, from thetime of its first establishment to the year 1786. On this occasion, he observes,that if we knew precisely the number of those who died immediately afterreception, or who brought in with them the germ of dissolution, a small partonly of the mortality would probably appear to be fairly attributable to thefoundling-hospital; as none would be so unreasonable, as to lay the loss ofthese certain victims to death to the account of a philanthropical institution,which enriches the country from year to year with an ever-increasing number ofhealthy, active, and industrious burghers.16[32_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_743]It appears to me, however, that the greatest part of this premature mortality isclearly to be attributed to these institutions, miscalled philanthropical. Ifany reliance can be placed on the accounts which are given of the infantmortality in the Russian towns and provinces, it would appear to be unusuallysmall. The greatness of it, therefore, at the foundling hospitals, may justly belaid to the account of institutions which encourage a mother to desert herchild, at the very time, when of all others, it stands most in need of herfostering care. The frail tenure by which an infant holds its life, will notallow of a remitted attention, even for a few hours.The surprising mortality which takes place at these two foundling hospitals ofPetersburgh and Moscow, which are managed in the best possible manner, as allwho have seen them, with one consent, assert, appears to me incontrovertibly toprove, that the nature of these institutions is not calculated to answer theimmediate end that they have in view, which I conceive to be, the preservationof a certain number of citizens to the state, which might otherwise, perhaps,perish from poverty or false shame. It is not to be doubted, that if thechildren received into these hospitals, had been left to the management of theirparents, taking the chance of all the difficulties in which they might beinvolved, a much greater proportion of them would have reached the age ofmanhood, and have become useful members of the state.When we look a little deeper into this subject, it will appear, that theseinstitutions not only fail in their immediate object, but by encouraging, in themost marked manner, habits of licentiousness, discourage marriage, and thusweaken the main spring of population. All the well-informed men with whom Iconversed on this subject, at Petersburgh, agreed invariably, that theinstitution had produced this effect in a surprising degree. To have a child,was considered as one of the most trifling faults which a girl could commit. AnEnglish merchant at Petersburgh told me, that a Russian girl, living in hisfamily, under a mistress, who was considered as very strict, had sent sixchildren to the foundling hospital without the loss of her place.It should be observed, however, that generally speaking, six children are notcommon in this kind of intercourse. Where habits of licentiousness prevail, thebirths are never in the same proportion to the number of people, as in themarried state; and therefore the discouragement to marriage, arising from thislicentiousness, and the diminished number of births which is the consequence ofit, will much more than counterbalance any encouragement to marriage, from theprospect held out to parents of disposing of the children which they cannotsupport.Considering the extraordinary mortality which occurs in these institutions, andthe habits of licentiousness which they have an evident tendency to create, itmay be said, perhaps, with truth, that if a person wished to check population,and were not solicitous about the means, he could not propose a more effectualmeasure, than the establishment of a sufficient number of foundling hospitals,unlimited in their reception of children. And with regard to the moral feelingsof a nation, it is difficult to conceive that they must not be very sensiblyimpaired by encouraging mothers to desert their offspring, and endeavouring toteach them, that their love for their new-born infants is a prejudice, which itis the interest of their country to eradicate. An occasional child-murder, fromfalse shame, is saved at a very high price, if it can only be done by thesacrifice of some of the best and most useful feelings of the human heart in agreat part of the nation.On the supposition that foundling hospitals attained their proposed end, thestate of slavery in Russia would, perhaps, render them more justifiable in thatcountry than in any other; because, every child brought up at the foundlinghospitals becomes a free citizen, and in this capacity is likely to be moreuseful to the state, than if it had merely increased the number of slavesbelonging to an individual proprietor. But in countries not similarlycircumstanced, the most complete success in institutions of this kind would be aglaring injustice to other parts of the society. The true encouragement tomarriage is, the high price of labour, and an increase of employments, whichrequire to be supplied with proper hands; but if the principal part of theseemployments, apprenticeships, &c. be filled up by foundlings, the demand forlabour among the legitimate part of the society must be proportionallydiminished, the difficulty of supporting a family be increased, and the bestencouragement to marriage removed.Russia has great natural resources. Its produce is, in its present state, aboveits consumptiòn, and it wants nothing but greater freedom of industriousexertion, and an adequate vent for its commodities in the interior parts of thecountry, to occasion an increase of population astonishingly rapid. Theprincipal obstacle to this, is, the vassalage, or rather slavery, of thepeasants, and the ignorance and indolence, which almost necessarily accompanysuch a state. The fortune of a Russian nobleman is measured by the number ofboors that he possesses, which in general are saleable, like cattle, and notadscripti glebæ. His revenue arises from a capitation tax on all the males. Whenthe boors upon an estate are increasing, new divisions of land are made atcertain intervals, and either more is taken into cultivation, or the old sharesare subdivided. Each family is awarded such a portion of land as it can properlycultivate, and will enable it to pay the tax. It is evidently the interest ofthe boor not to improve his lands much, and appear to get considerably more thanis necessary to support his family and pay the poll-tax; because the naturalconsequence will be, that in the next division that takes place, the farm, whichhe before possessed, will be considered as capable of supporting two families,and he will be deprived of the half of it. The indolent cultivation that such astate of things must produce, is easily conceivable. When a boor is deprived ofmuch of the land which he had before used, he makes complaints of inability topay his tax, and demands permission for himself, or his sons, to go and earn itin the towns. This permission is in general eagerly sought after, and is grantedwithout much difficulty by the seigneurs, in consideration of a small increaseof the poll-tax. The consequence is, that the lands in the country are left halfcultivated, and the genuine spring of population impaired in its source.A Russian nobleman at Petersburgh, of whom I asked some questious, respectingthe management of his estate, told me, that he never troubled himself to inquirewhether it was properly cultivated or not, which he seemed to consider as amatter in which he was not in the smallest degree concerned. Cela m’est egal,says he, cela me fait ni bien ni mal. He gave his boors permission to earn theirtax how and where they liked, and as long as he received it, he was satisfied.But it is evident, that, by this kind of conduct, he sacrificed the futurepopulation of his estate, and the consequent future increase of his revenues, toconsiderations of indolence and present convenience.It is certain, however, that of late years many noblemen have attended more tothe improvement and population of their estates, instigated, principally, by theprecepts and examples of the empress Catherine, who made the greatest exertionsto advance the cultivation of the country. Her immense importations of Germansettlers, not only contributed to people her state with free citizens, insteadof slaves, but what was perhaps of still more importance, to set an example ofindustry, and of modes of directing that industry, totally unknown before to theRussian peasants.These exertions have been crowned, upon the whole, with great success; and it isnot to be doubted, that, during the reign of the late empress, and since, a veryconsiderable increase of cultivation and of population has been going forward,in almost every part of the Russian empire.In the year 1763, an enumeration of the people, estimated by the poll-tax, gavea population of 14,726,696; and the same kind of enumeration in 1783, gave apopulation of 25,677,000, which, if correct, shews a very extraordinaryincrease; but it is supposed, that the enumeration in 1783, was more correct andcomplete than the one in 1763. Including the provinces not subject to thepoll-tax, the general calculation for 1763, was 20,000,000, and for 1796,36,000,000.17 [32_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_745]NOTES1 [32_III__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_716].

IV.On the fruitfulness of Marriages.NOTWITHSTANDING the extraordinary proportions of births to deaths in Russia,which have been noticed in the last chapter, and the confirmation of theseproportions, in a considerable degree, by actual enumerations, which establish avery rapid increase, it appears, that, in most of the provinces, each marriageyields only three children.But if we reflect a moment, it will be clear, that to prevent the population ofa country from regularly decreasing, it is absolutely necessary that eachmarriage, on an average, should yield a marriage, that is, yield two childrenwho live to be married. If the result fall short of this, the number ofmarriages must be gradually diminishing, and the number of children to eachmarriage remaining the same, the population, of course, will continuedecreasing. If each marriage yield accurately two marrying children, the numberof marriages, and the number of children, being the same in every generation,the population can be neither retrograde nor progressive, but must remainexactly stationary.Supposing each marriage to produce three children, as appears to be the case,according to the lists in some of the provinces of Russia, it will be granted,that one, out of three, is but a small proportion to allow for all who die ininfancy and celibacy. But admitting this proportion, which may perhaps be truein the present instance, though it is very rarely so in other situations, itwill follow that exactly two children, and no more, from every marriage, live toform a fresh union; in which case, from what has been before observed, noincrease is possible. And yet in these same provinces, the proportion of thebirths to the deaths is given as 26 to 10; 22 to 10; 21 to 10; 20 to 10, &c:which implies a very rapid increase. The lists therefore involve a most completecontradiction. Yet there is no reason to suspect the accuracy of the statementsrespecting the births and marriages; and, allowing for some omissions in theburials, the excess of births will still be great, and indeed, the increasingstate of the population has been ascertained by the enumerations, mentioned inthe last chapter.Contradictory as these lists appear, they do not involve a greater contradictionthan the lists of other countries, which purport to express the number of birthswhich each marriage yields. And it may perhaps contribute to the betterunderstanding of the tables, which I shall have occasion to notice in the nextchapter, if I endeavour to explain a very important error into which all thewriters in political arithmetic, that I have ever met with, have fallen,relative to this subject.These lists are, in reality, enumerations of the annual marriages and the annualbirths; and the proportion between them, of course, accurately expresses theproportion of births to marriages which takes place in the year; but thisproportion has been assumed to express the number of births which eachindividual marriage in the course of its duration yields. On what grounds thisassumption has been made, will appear from the following considerations.If, in a country where there were no exports or imports of people, we couldobtain the number of births and of marriages that had taken place in the courseof a very long period, it is evident, that double the number of marriages, or,which is the same thing, the number of married people, would express accuratelythe proportion of the born which had lived to be married; and the differencebetween this number and the number of births, would also express accurately, theproportion of the born which had died in infancy and celibacy. But the wholenumbers of births and marriages, during this period, are evidently nothing morethan the sum of the annual births, and the sum of the annual marriages. If,therefore, in any country, an average proportion can be obtained between theannual births and annual marriages, this proportion will manifestly express thesame thing as the whole numbers; that is, the number of persons annuallymarried, compared with the number of annual births, will accurately express theproportion of the born which lives to be married; and the difference betweenthem, the proportion of the born which dies in infancy and celibacy. Forinstance, if the average proportion of annual marriages to annual births, in anycountry, be as 1 to 4, this will imply, that, out of four children born, two ofthem live to marry, and the other two die in infancy and celibacy. This is amost important and interesting piece of information, from which the most usefulinferences are to be drawn; but it is totally different from the number ofbirths which each individual marriage yields in the course of its duration; somuch so, that on the supposition which has been just made, that half of the bornlive to be married, which is a very usual proportion, the annual marriages wouldbe to the annual births as 1 to 4, whether each individual marriage yielded 4births, 2 births, or 100 births. If the latter number be taken, then, accordingto the present supposition, 50 would live to be married; and out of every 100births there would be 25 marriages, and the marriages would still be to thebirths as 1 to 4. The same proportion would evidently hold good in the case oftwo births yielded by each marriage, as this proportion is not in the smallestdegree affected by the number of children which a marriage in the course of itsduration may yield, but merely relates to the number of these children who liveto be married, or the number of births from which one marriage results.The only case in which the proportion of annual births to annual marriages, isthe same, as the proportion of births which each individual marriage yields, is,when the births and deaths are exactly equal; and the reason of their being thesame in this case is, that, in order to make the births and deaths exactlyequal, we must assume, that each marriage yields exactly another marriage, andthat, whatever be the number of children born from each union, they all die ininfancy and celibacy, except one pair. Thus, if each marriage yield fivechildren, two of which only live to form a fresh union, the proportion of annualmarriages, to annual births, will be as 1 to 5, which is the same as the numberof births yielded by each individual marriage, by hypothesis. But whenever eachmarriage yields either more or less than one marrying pair, that is, wheneverthe population is either increasing or decreasing, then the proportion of annualbirths to annual marriages, can never be the same, as the proportion of birthsyielded by each individual marriage in the course of its duration.Hence it follows, that whenever we assume them to be the same, any increase ofpopulation is impossible. Thus, if the foregoing reasoning be admitted, and itbe granted that the proportion of persons yearly married, to the number ofchildren yearly born, truly expresses the proportion of the born which lives tobe married; then, assuming at the same time, what is assumed by those whoproduce these lists, that they express the number of births yielded by eachindividual marriage, it is evident, that all such lists prove that thepopulation is stationary; whereas, perhaps, from other accounts, it is knownwith certainty, that a rapid increase is going forwards. Thus, in Sweden, if weallow that the proportion of yearly marriages to yearly births, which is as 1 to4 and 1/10, expresses, what it really does, that out of 4 and 1/10 births, onepair lives to marry; and suppose, at the same time, according to Wargentin,Susmilch, Crome, Price, and others, that each marriage, in the course of itsduration, yields only 4-1/10 births, it would follow, that, out of 4-1/10births, 2 and 1/10 die in infancy and celibacy, and only two children from eachmarriage live to form a fresh union, in which case no increase would bepossible, though, from the excess of births above the deaths, and even fromactual enumerations, it might be completely ascertained, that the progress ofthe population was considerable.Dr. Price had considered this subject sufficiently to see, that, in countrieswhere an increase or decrease of population was taking place, these lists didnot accurately express the number of births yielded by each marriage; but thathe was very far from coming at what I conceive to be the just conclusion on thispoint, appears, from his observing that, on the supposition that half of theborn live to marry, if the prolifickness of marriages were to increase, thebirths would rise above quadruple the weddings;1[33_IV__On_the_fruitfulness_of_marri.html#id_753] whereas, in fact, as long asexactly half of the born live to be married, the annual births will always beexactly quadruple the annual weddings, let the prolifickness of marriages varyin any conceivable degree.2 [33_IV__On_the_fruitfulness_of_marri.html#id_751]As a further proof that Dr. Price did not understand this subject, though he hasa long and elaborate note on it, he often mentions the lists of the yearlybirths and marriages, as expressing the number of children born to eachmarriage, and particularly notices the proportion in Sweden, as shewing thedegree of prolifickness in the marriages of that country.3[33_IV__On_the_fruitfulness_of_marri.html#id_749] He merely thought that thelists of annual births and marriages, did not, in all cases, express accuratelythe prolifickness of marriages; but he does not seem to have been in thesmallest degree aware, that they had absolutely nothing to do with it; and that,so far from being merely inaccurate, it would be impossible, from such lists,unaccompanied by other information, to tell with certainty, whether theprolifickness in the marriages of any country were such as to yield 2 births, or100 births in the course of their duration.Such lists, therefore, considered as expressing the prolifickness of marriages,must be rejected as perfectly useless; but considered as expressing theproportion of the born which lives to be married, should be preserved as highlyvaluable, and as giving a most interesting and desirable piece of information.The late empress Catherine, in her instructions for a new code of laws inRussia, says, “our peasants have for the most part twelve, fifteen, and even asfar as twenty children from one marriage.”4[33_IV__On_the_fruitfulness_of_marri.html#id_747] This is certainly anexaggeration; but the probability is, that the assertion was founded on aknowledge that the Russian women were generally prolifick; and yet, according tothe lists which have been produced, it would appear that in most of theprovinces, one marriage yields only three children, which is perfectlyirreconcileable with the assertions of the empress. But, according to theforegoing reasonings, these lists merely express that, out of three childrenborn, two live to be married, which agrees with the extraordinary healthiness inearly life noticed in some of the provinces. The probability is, that eachmarriage in these provinces, yields about 6 births, 4 of which live to marry;and this supposition, which retains the proper proportion of the births to themarriages, according to the lists, will account for the excess of the birthsabove the deaths, and the rapid increase of the population.In those provinces where the annual births are to the annual marriages as 4 to1, there, according to the principles laid down, only 2 out of 4, instead of 2out of 3, live to be married; and to produce the excess of births, observed insome of these provinces, even after making great allowances for omissions in theburials,5 [33_IV__On_the_fruitfulness_of_marri.html#id_759] it will be necessaryto suppose, that there were full as many as 8 births to each marriage in thecourse of its duration.Taking the general proportion of annual births to marriages for the wholecountry, as given by Mr. Tooke, then it would appear, that, out of 362 births,200 lived to marry,6 [33_IV__On_the_fruitfulness_of_marri.html#id_757] and toproduce a proportion of births to deaths, as 2 to 1, instead of 2-1/4 to 1, asgiven by Mr. Tooke, that is, allowing the 1/4 for the omissions in the burials,it will be necessary to suppose 7 or 7-1/2 births to each marriage, which may insome degree justify the assertions of the empress.7[33_IV__On_the_fruitfulness_of_marri.html#id_755]These are rough calculations, formed by constructing tables on the plan of oneproduced by Wallace, in his Dissertation on the Numbers of Mankind, andobserving the proportions of births to deaths, which result from differentsuppositions respecting the number of children born, and the number which liveto be married. As this dissertation is not in every person’s hands, I insert thetable, in order that the reader may see the grounds on which I have gone inthese calculations.TABLE I.[../img/218_1.png]It sets out with a single pair, but of course it is the same thing, whether webegin with 2 people or 2 millions of people. There are 8 columns, the contentsof which are explained at the top of each.The object of Mr. Wallace, in this table, was merely to shew the progress ofpopulation from a single pair, and the period of doubling; but, if no essentialfault be found with the construction of it, it may be applied more extensivelyand usefully.The periods are taken at 33-1/3 years; but the real period of a generation will,of course, vary in different countries, according to the average age ofmarriage. Each marriage is supposed to yield 6 children, 2 of whom, or onethird, die in infancy or celibacy; and 4, or two thirds, forming two marriages,are left alive to breed.If we examine the numbers in the second period, we shall find 12, in the 3dcolumn, which expresses the births; 4, in the 4th column, which expresses thedeaths in infancy and celibacy; and 2, in the 6th column, which expresses thedeaths of the parents. Consequently the births are to the deaths, in the sameperiod, as 12 to 4+2, as 12 to 6, or 2 to 1, and the proportions continue thesame in all the other periods. From which, I think, we may safely infer, that,if in any country the births be to the deaths as 2 to 1, and two thirds of theborn live to marry, that each marriage must yield exactly 6 children.If we examine the births and marriages in any of the contemporaneous periods, weshall find, in the second period, 12 births, and 8 marrying persons, or theproportion of 12 births to 4 marriages; in the third period, 24 births and 16marrying persons, or the proportion of 24 births to 8 marriages; and so onalways in the proportion of 3 to 1. But the proportion of the sum of births tothe sum of marriages, during these periods, must be the same, as any correctannual average; and consequently, the annual births are to the annual marriagesas 3 to 1; from which, according to the usual mode of calculation, it would beinferred, that each marriage yielded 3 children, though we set out with thesupposition of 6 children to each marriage; a contradiction, which stronglyconfirms the reasonings of the foregoing part of this chapter, and shews, thatthe proportion of annual births to annual marriages does not express the numberof children to each marriage, but a very different thing, namely, the number ofthe born which live to marry.If, instead of two thirds, as in the present instance, we suppose that only halfof the born live to marry, which is a more common proportion; then, for thesecond period, we shall have in the third column, expressing the births, thenumber 9, and in the fifth column, expressing the marrying persons 4-1/2:consequently, the marriages will be to the births as 1 to 4, which is the mostusual average of Europe; though, in the present instance, we still suppose, thateach marriage yields six children in the course of its duration. On the samesupposition, the births will be to the deaths, as 9 to 4-1/2 + 2, as 18 to 13,or about 13-4/5 to 10; and consequently it may be inferred, that, when thebirths are to the deaths as 13-4/5 to 10, or 138 to 100, and half of the bornlive to marry, each marriage must yield six births.If we suppose five births to a marriage, and that half of the born live tomarry, then, according to the table, the births will be to the deaths, as, about12-1/5 to 10; and consequently we may infer, in the same manner, that when thebirths are to the deaths as 12-1/5 to 10, and half of the born live to marry,that each marriage must yield 5 children.Upon these principles, if we can obtain, in any country, the proportion ofbirths to deaths, and of births to marriages, we may calculate pretty nearly thenumber of children born to each marriage.8[33_IV__On_the_fruitfulness_of_marri.html#id_761] This number will indeed turnout to be very different from the results of the old mode of calculation; butthis circumstance is rather in favour of its correctness; because the knownfacts respecting population, cannot possibly be accounted for, according to theusual mode of estimating the number of births to a marriage, which gives lessthan four, for the general average of Europe.Buffon has inserted in his work some tables of mortality, which he means shouldbe considered as applicable to the whole human race. By these, it appears, thathalf of the born die under eight years and one month old.9[33_IV__On_the_fruitfulness_of_marri.html#id_763] If we apply the average offour children to a marriage, to Buffon’s estimate of mortality, it would appear,that the population of Europe, instead of having a strong tendency to increase,is in danger of being extinct in the course of some years. Instead of increasingin a geometrical ratio, it would be decreasing in a geometrical ratio. If two,out of the four children allowed to each marriage, were to die under 8 years anda month old, the utmost that we could possibly expect, is, that 1-1/2 shouldsurvive, to form a fresh union, or that four present marriages should yieldthree in the next generation; a ratio of decrease, which would, in no very longperiod, unpeople Europe.But the truth is, that both the calculations are incorrect. Buffon’s tables weretaken from the registers of Paris, and its neighbouring villages, and can by nomeans be considered as generally applicable. The source of the other error hasbeen attempted to be pointed out in this chapter.It is only in unhealthy towns, or villages very peculiarly circumstanced, thathalf of the born die under 8 or 9 years of age. Taking an average throughoutEurope, I have little doubt, that not only above half of the born live beyondthe age of puberty, but that each marriage yields considerably above fourbirths, I should think, more than five. The poverty which checks population,tends much more powerfully to increase the number of deaths, than to diminishthe number of births.In forming conclusions respecting the proportion of the born which lives to bemarried from the lists of annual births and annual marriages, which, accordingto the principles laid down, is the only point of view in which they are useful;there is one circumstance, which, if not particularly attended to, may lead toconsiderable error.In country parishes, from which there are emigrations, the proportion whichlives to be married will be given too small, and in towns which receivecontinually an accession of strangers, this proportion will be given much toogreat. The proportion of annual births to annual marriages, is in generalhigher, in the country, than in towns; but if there were no changing ofinhabitants, the proportion in the towns would be much the highest. If, in acountry parish, the births be to the weddings, as 4, or 4-1/2, to 1, thisimplies, that, out of 4 or 4-1/2 births, in that place, 2 lived to be married inthat place; but many probably emigrated and married in other places, andtherefore we cannot positively infer, from this proportion, that only 2 out ofthe 4, or 4-1/2, lived to be married.In towns, the proportion of births to marriages is very often only 3, and 3-1/2,to 1, which would seem to imply that, out of 3, or 3-1/2 children, 2 lived to bemarried; but in these towns, it is known perhaps from the bills of mortality,that much above half of the born die under the age of puberty. The proportionwhich has been mentioned, therefore, cannot possibly express the real proportionof the children born in the town, which lives to be married, but is caused bythe accession of strangers, whose marriages appear in the registers, though nottheir births. In towns, where there is a great mortality in early life, if nomarriages were registered but of those who were born in the place, theproportion of annual births to annual marriages, would be greater than theproportion of children born to each marriage, in the course of its duration, andwould amount, perhaps, to 6 or 7 to 1, instead of 3, or 3-1/2, to 1.In Leipsic, the proportion of births to weddings, is only 2 and 8/10 to 1;10[33_IV__On_the_fruitfulness_of_marri.html#id_769] and Susmilch, supposing thisto imply that there were only 2 and 8/10 children born to each marriage, puzzleshimself to account for this extraordinary unfruitfulness; but this appearance inthe registers, without doubt, arises, either from a great accession ofstrangers, or from a custom among the inhabitants of the neighbouring country,of celebrating their marriages in the town.At Geneva, where the registers are supposed to be kept with considerable care,the number of marriages, from the year 1701 to 1760, was 21,493, and the numberof births in the same period, 42,076; from which it is inferred, that eachmarriage had yielded, on an average, less than two children. The author of avaluable paper in the Bibliotheque Britannique, who mentions these numbers,11[33_IV__On_the_fruitfulness_of_marri.html#id_767] naturally expresses somesurprise at the result, but still adopts it as the measure of the fruitfulnessof the Geneva women. The circumstance, however, arises undoubtedly from theconstant influx of new settlers, whose marriages appear in the registers but nottheir births. If the number of children from each individual mother were tracedwith care in the bills of mortality at Geneva, I am confident that the resultwould be very different.In Paris the proportion of annual births to annual marriages, is about 4-1/2 to1,12 [33_IV__On_the_fruitfulness_of_marri.html#id_765] and the women have, inconsequence, been considered as more prolifick than usual for a large town; butno such inference can properly be drawn from this proportion, which is probablycaused, merely by the infrequency of marriages among persons not born in thetown, and the custom of celebrating marriages in the neighbouring villages. Thesmall number of weddings which takes place in Paris, in proportion to the wholepopulation,13 [33_IV__On_the_fruitfulness_of_marri.html#id_771] and the morethan usual number in the villages round Paris, seem to confirm this supposition.The rapidity of the increase in population depends upon the number of childrenborn to each marriage, and the proportion of that number which lives to form afresh union. The measure of this rapidity is the proportion, which the excess ofthe births above the deaths, bears to the whole population.That the reader may see at once the tendency to increase, and the period ofdoubling, which would result from any observed proportion of births to deaths,and of these to the whole population, I subjoin two tables from Susmilch,calculated by Euler, which I believe are very correct. The first is confined tothe supposition of a mortality of 1 in 36, and therefore can only be applied tocountries where such a mortality is known to take place. The other is general,depending solely upon the proportion, which the excess of the births above theburials, bears to the whole population, and therefore may be applied universallyto all countries, whatever may be the degree of their mortality.It will be observed, that when the proportion between the births and burials isgiven, the period of doubling will be shorter, the greater the mortality;because the births, as well as deaths, are increased by this supposition, andthey both bear a greater proportion to the whole population, than if themortality were smaller, and there were a greater number of people in advancedlife.The general mortality of Russia, according to Mr. Tooke, as has before beenstated, is 1 in 58, and the proportion of births 1 in 26. Allowing something forthe omissions in the burials, if we assume the mortality to be 1 in 52, then thebirths will be to the deaths as 2 to 1, and the proportion, which the excess ofbirths bears to the whole population, will be 1/52. According to Table III[33_IV__On_the_fruitfulness_of_marri.html#page_191]. the period of doublingwill, in this case, be about 36 years. But if we were to keep the proportion ofbirths to deaths as 2 to 1, and suppose a mortality of 1 in 36, as in Table II[33_IV__On_the_fruitfulness_of_marri.html#id_2493]. the excess of births abovethe burials would be 1/36 of the whole population, and the period of doublingwould be only 25 years.It is evident, that in countries which are very healthy, and where, inconsequence, the number of grown up people is great, the births can never bearthe same proportion to the whole population, as where the number of grown peopleis smaller; and therefore the excess of births above the deaths, cannot, in soshort a time, produce a number equal to the former population.TABLE II.When in any country there are 100,000 persons living and the mortality is 1 in36.[../img/223_1.png]TABLE III.[../img/224_1.png][../img/225_1.png]NOTES1 [33_IV__On_the_fruitfulness_of_marri.html#id_752]. Observations on Revers.Paym. vol. i. p. 270, note.2 [33_IV__On_the_fruitfulness_of_marri.html#id_750]. That is, when a sufficienttime has elapsed, to let the births affect the marriages. Before this period,indeed, Dr. Price’s observation would be just; but, practically, it seldomhappens that the women of a country become all at once more prolifick thanusual; and in the general tables of mortality from which the deductions aremade, if they be not such, as for the births to affect the marriages, theycannot express a just average of any kind, and are in every point of view almostentirely useless.3 [33_IV__On_the_fruitfulness_of_marri.html#id_748].

I am inclined to believe,that where only half of the born live to be married, the proportion of thebirths to the deaths can never rise quite so high as 2 to 1, whatever may be thenumber of children to a marriage. The lists, therefore, such as those ofVeronesch, which imply that only half of the born live to be married, at thesame time that the births are to the deaths in the proportion of above 2 to 1,can only be accounted for by great omissions in the deaths, and by emigrations.6 [33_IV__On_the_fruitfulness_of_marri.html#id_756]. Tooke’s View of RussianEmpire, vol. ii. b. iii. p. 147.7 [33_IV__On_the_fruitfulness_of_marri.html#id_754]. On the supposition that Ihave not assumed the proper proportions of births to deaths, which, from notknowing how to estimate the acknowledged omissions in the burials, is veryprobable, the results of course will be changed, and therefore too much stressshould not be laid on them.8 [33_IV__On_the_fruitfulness_of_marri.html#id_760].

In Geneva, it is as 1 to 64; and thisextraordinary proportion of marriages, is certainly owing principally to thegreat influx of foreign settlers. In places, where the proportion of annualbirths to annual marriages is much influenced by new settlers, or emigrations,few accurate inferences can be drawn from them, in any way. They neither expressthe fruitfulness of marriages, nor the proportion of the born which lives to bemarried."},{"pageContent":"CHAP. V.Of the Checks to Population in the middle parts of Europe.I HAVE dwelt longer on the northern states of Europe, than their relativeimportance might, to some, appear to demand, because their internal economy is,in many respects, essentially different from our own, and a personal, thoughslight, acquaintance with these countries, has enabled me to mention a fewparticulars which have not yet been before the publick. In the middle parts ofEurope, the division of labour, the distribution of employments, and theproportion of the inhabitants of towns to the inhabitants of the country, differso little from what is observable in England, that it would be in vain to seekfor the checks to their population in any peculiarity of habits and mannerssufficiently marked to admit of description. I shall, therefore, endeavour todirect the reader’s attention, principally, to some inferences drawn from thelists of births, marriages, and deaths in different countries; and these datawill, in many important points, give us more information respecting theirinternal economy than we could receive from the most observing traveller.One of the most curious and instructive points of view in which we can considerlists of this kind, appears to me to be, in the dependence of the marriages onthe deaths. It has been justly observed by Montesquieu, that wherever there is aplace for two persons to live comfortably, a marriage will certainly ensue:1[34_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_773] but in most of the countriesin Europe, in the present state of their population, experience will not allowus to expect any sudden and great increase in the means of supporting a family.The place, therefore, for the new marriage must, in general, be made by thedissolution of an old one; and we find, in consequence, that, except after somegreat mortality, from whatever cause it may have proceeded, or some suddenchange of policy peculiarly favourable to cultivation and trade, the number ofannual marriages is regulated principally by the number of annual deaths. Theyreciprocally influence each other. There are few countries in which the commonpeople have so much foresight, as to defer marriage, till they have a fairprospect of being able to support properly all their children. Some of themortality, therefore, in almost every country, is forced by the too greatfrequency of marriage; and in every country, a great mortality, whether arisingprincipally from this cause, or occasioned by the number of great towns andmanufactories, and the natural unhealthiness of the situation, will necessarilyproduce a great frequency of marriage.A most striking exemplification of this observation occurs in the case of somevillages in Holland. Susmilch has calculated the mean proportion of annualmarriages, compared with the number of inhabitants, as between 1 in 107, and 1in 113, in countries which have not been thinned by plagues or wars, or in whichthere is no sudden increase in the means of subsistence.2[34_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_781] And Crome, a later statisticalwriter, taking a mean between 1 in 92 and 1 in 122, estimates the averageproportion of marriages to inhabitants as 1 to 108.3[34_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_779] But in the registers of 22Dutch villages the accuracy of which, according to Susmilch, there is no reasonto doubt, it appears that out of 64 persons there is 1 annual marriage.4[34_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_2097] This is a most extraordinarydeviation from the mean proportion. When I first saw this number mentioned, nothaving then adverted to the mortality in these villages, I was much astonished,and very little satisfied with Susmilch’s attempt to account for it, by talkingof the great number of trades, and the various means of getting a livelihood, inHolland,5 [34_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_777] as it is evident,that, the country having been long in the same state, there would be no reasonto expect any great yearly accession of new trades and new means of subsistence,and the old ones would of course all be full. But the difficulty was immediatelysolved, when it appeared that the mortality was between 1 in 22, and 1 in 23,6[34_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_775] instead of being 1 in 36, asis usual when the marriages are in the proportion of 1 to 108. The births anddeaths were nearly equal. The extraordinary number of marriages was not causedby the opening of any new sources of subsistence, and therefore produced noincrease of population. It was merely occasioned by the rapid dissolution of theold marriages by death, and the consequent vacancy of some employment by which afamily might be supported.It might be a question, in this case, whether the too great frequency ofmarriage, that is, the pressure of the population too hard against the limits ofsubsistence, contributed most to produce the mortality, or the mortality,occasioned naturally by the employments of the people and unhealthiness of thecountry, the frequency of marriage. In the present instance, I should, withoutdoubt, incline to the latter supposition, particularly, as it seems to begenerally agreed, that the common people in Holland are, upon the whole, welloff. The great mortality probably arises, partly from the natural marshiness ofthe soil, and the number of canals, and partly from the very great proportion ofthe people, which is engaged in sedentary occupations, and the very small numberin the healthy employments of agriculture.A very curious and striking contrast to these Dutch villages, tending toillustrate the present subject, will be recollected in what was said respectingthe state of Norway. In Norway, the mortality is 1 in 48, and the marriages 1 in130. In the Dutch villages, the mortality 1 in 23, and the marriages 1 in 64.The difference both in the marriages and deaths is above double. They maintaintheir relative proportions in a very exact manner, and shew how much the deathsand marriages mutually depend upon each other, and that, except where somesudden start in the agriculture of a country enlarges the means of subsistence,an increase of marriages will only produce an increase of mortality, and viceversá.In Russia, this sudden start in agriculture has, in great measure, taken place;and consequently, though the mortality is very small, yet, the proportion ofmarriages is not so. But in the progress of the population of Russia, if theproportion of marriages remain the same as at present, the mortality willinevitably increase, or if the mortality remain nearly the same, the proportionof marriages will diminish.Susmilch has produced some striking instances of this gradual decrease in theproportional number of marriages, in the progress of a country to a fullerpopulation, and a more complete occupation of all the means of gaining alivelihood.In the town of Halle, in the year 1700, the number of annual marriages was tothe whole population as 1 to 77. During the course of the 55 following years,this proportion changed gradually, according to Susmilch’s calculation, to 1 in167.7 [34_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_785] This is a mostextraordinary difference, and, if the calculation were quite accurate, wouldprove to what a degree the preventive check to population had operated, and howcompletely it had measured itself to the means of subsistence. As, however, thenumber of people is estimated by calculation, and not taken from enumerations,this very great difference in the proportions may not be perfectly correct, ormay be occasioned in part by other causes.In the town of Leipsic, in the year 1620, the annual marriages were to thepopulation as 1 to 82: from the year 1741 to 1756, they were as 1 to 120.8[34_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_783]In Augsburgh, in 1510, the proportion of marriages to the population was as 1 to86; in 1750, as 1 to 123.9 [34_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_791]In Dantzic, in the year 1705, the proportion was as 1 to 89; in 1745 as 1 to118.10 [34_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_2099]In the dukedom of Magdeburgh in 1700, the proportion was as 1 to 87; from 1752to 1755, as 1 to 125.In the principality of Halberstadt, in 1690, the proportion was as 1 to 88; in1756, as 1 to 112.In the dukedom of Cleves, in 1705, the proportion was 1 to 83; in 1755, 1 to100.In the Churmark of Brandenburgh, in 1700, the proportion was 1 to 76; in 1755, 1to 108.11 [34_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_2101]More instances of this kind might be produced; but these are sufficient to shewthat, in countries where, from a sudden increase in the means of subsistence,arising either from a great previous mortality, or from improving cultivationand trade, room has been made for a number of marriages much beyond thosedissolved by death; this additional number will annually decrease, in proportionas all the new employments are filled up, and there is no further room for anincreasing population.But in countries which have long been fully peopled, and in which no new sourcesof subsistence are opening, the marriages being regulated principally by thedeaths, will generally bear nearly the same proportion to the whole population,at one period as at another. And the same constancy will take place, even incountries where there is an annual increase in the means of subsistence,provided this increase be uniform and permanent. Supposing it to be such, as forhalf a century, to allow every year of a fixed number of marriages beyond thosedissolved by death, the population would then be increasing, and perhapsrapidly; but it is evident, that the proportion of marriages to the wholepopulation, would remain the same during the whole period.This proportion Susmilch has endeavoured to ascertain in different countries anddifferent situations. In the villages of the Churmark of Brandenburgh, 1marriage out of 109 persons takes place annually;12[34_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_789] and the general proportion foragricultural villages, he thinks, may be taken at between 1 in 108, and 1 in115.13 [34_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_787] In the small towns ofthe Churmark where the mortality is greater, the proportion is 1 to 98:14[34_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_2103] in the Dutch villagesmentioned before, 1 to 64: in Berlin 1 to 110:15[34_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_795] in Paris 1 to 137:16[34_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_2105] according to Crome in theunmarrying cities of Paris and Rome, the proportion is only 1 to 160.17[34_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_793]All general proportions, however, of every kind, should be applied withconsiderable caution, as it seldom happens that the increase of food and ofpopulation is uniform; and when the circumstances of a country are varying,either from this cause, or from any change in the habits of the people withrespect to prudence and cleanliness, it is evident, that a proportion which istrue at one period, will not be so at another.Nothing is more difficult than to lay down rules on these subjects that do notadmit of exceptions. Generally speaking, it might be taken for granted, that anincreased facility in the means of gaining a livelihood, either from a greatprevious mortality, or from improving cultivation and trade, would produce agreater proportion of annual marriages; but this effect might not perhapsfollow. Supposing the people to have been before in a very depressed state, andmuch of the mortality to have arisen from the want of foresight which usuallyaccompanies such a state, it is possible, that the sudden improvement of theircondition, might give them more of a decent and proper pride; and theconsequence would be, that the proportional number of marriages might remainnearly the same, but they would all rear more of their children, and theadditional population that was wanted, would be supplied by a diminishedmortality, instead of an increased number of births.In the same manner, if the population of any country had been long stationary,and would not easily admit of an increase, it is possible that a change in thehabits of the people, from improved education, or any other cause, mightdiminish the proportional number of marriages; but as fewer children would belost in infancy, from the diseases consequent on poverty, the diminution in thenumber of marriages would be balanced by the diminished mortality, and thepopulation would be kept up to its proper level by a smaller number of births.Such changes, therefore, in the habits of a people should evidently be takeninto consideration.The most general rule that can be laid down on this subject is, perhaps, thatany direct encouragements to marriage must be accompanied by an increasedmortality. The natural tendency to marriage is, in every country, so great,that, without any encouragements whatever, a proper place for a marriage willalways be filled up. Such encouragements, therefore, must be either perfectlyfutile, or produce a marriage where there is not a proper place for one, and theconsequence must necessarily be, increased poverty and mortality. Montesquieu,in his Lettres Persanes, says, that in the past wars of France, the fear ofbeing inrolled in the militia, tempted a great number of young men to marry,without the proper means of supporting a family, and the effect was, the birthof a crowd of children, que l’on cher-che encore en France, et que la misère lafamine et les maladies en ont “fait disparoître.”18[34_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_799]After so striking an illustration of the necessary effects, of directencouragements to marriage, it is perfectly astonishing, that in his Esprit desLoix, he should say that Europe is still in a state to require laws which favourthe propagation of the human species.19[34_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_2107]Susmilch adopts the same ideas, and though he contemplates the case of thenumber of marriages coming necessarily to a stand, when the food is not capableof further increase, and examines some countries, in which, the number ofcontracted marriages is exactly measured by the number dissolved by death, yethe still thinks that it is one of the principal duties of government to attendto the number of marriages. He cites the examples of Augustus and Trajan, andthinks that a prince or a statesman would really merit the name of father of hispeople, if, from the proportion of 1 to 120 or 125, he could increase themarriages to the proportion of 1 to 80 or 90.20[34_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_797] But as it clearly appears,from the instances which he himself produces, that in countries which have beenlong tolerably well peopled, death is the most powerful of all theencouragements to marriage, the prince or statesman who should succeed in thusgreatly increasing the number of marriages, might, perhaps, deserve much morejustly the title of destroyer, than father, of his people.The proportion of yearly births to the whole population, must evidently dependprincipally upon the proportion of the people marrying annually; and, therefore,in countries which will not admit of a great increase of population, must, likethe marriages, depend principally on the deaths. Where an actual decrease ofpopulation is not taking place, the births will always supply the vacancies madeby death, and exactly so much more, as the increasing agriculture and trade ofthe country will admit. In almost every part of Europe during the intervals ofthe great plagues, epidemicks, or unusually destructive wars, with which it isoccasionally visited, the births exceed the deaths; but as the mortality variesvery much in different countries and situations, the births will be found tovary in the same manner, though from the excess of births above deaths, whichmost countries can admit, not in the same degree.In 39 villages of Holland, where the deaths are about 1 in 23, the births arealso about 1 in 23.21 [34_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_800] In 15villages round Paris, the births bear the same, or even a greater proportion tothe whole population, on account of a still greater mortality. The births are 1in 22-7/10, and the deaths the same.22[34_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_2109] In the small towns ofBrandenburgh, which are in an increasing state, the mortality is 1 in 29, andthe births 1 in 24-7/10.23 [34_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_2111] InSweden, where the mortality is about 1 in 35, the births are 1 in 28.24[34_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_2113] In 1056 villages ofBrandenburgh, in which the mortality is about 1 in 39 or 40, the births areabout 1 in 30.25 [34_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_2115] In Norway,where the mortality is 1 in 48, the births are 1 in 34.26[34_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_2117] In all these instances, thebirths are evidently measured by the deaths, after making a proper allowance forthe excess of births which the state of each country will admit. In Russia thisallowance must be great, as, although the mortality may perhaps be taken as only1 in 48 or 50, the births are as high as 1 in 26, owing to the present rapidincrease of the population.Statistical writers have endeavoured to obtain a general measure of mortalityfor all countries taken together; but, if such a measure could be obtained, I donot see what good purpose it could answer. It would be but of little use inascertaining the population of Europe, or of the world; and it is evident, that,in applying it to particular countries or particular places, we might be ledinto the grossest errors. When the mortality of the human race, in differentcountries, and different situations, varies so much as from 1 in 20, to 1 in 60,no general average could be used with safety in a particular case, without sucha knowledge of the circumstances of the country, with respect to the number oftowns, the habits of the people, and the healthiness of the situation, as wouldprobably supersede the necessity of resorting to any general proportion, by theknowledge of the particular proportion suited to the country.There is one leading circumstance, however, affecting the mortality ofcountries, which may be considered as very general, and which is, at the sametime, completely open to observation. This is the number of towns in any state,which has been before alluded to, and the proportion of town to countryinhabitants. The unfavourable effects of close habitations and sedentaryemployments on the health are universal; and therefore, on the number of peopleliving in this manner, compared with the number employed in agriculture, willmuch depend the general mortality of the state. Upon this principle it has beencalculated, that when the proportion of the people in the towns, to those in thecountry, is as 1 to 3. then the mortality is about 1 in 36, which rises to 1 in35, or 1 in 33, when the proportion of townsmen to villagers is 2 to 5, or 3 to7; and falls below 1 in 36, when this proportion is 2 to 7, or, 1 to 4. On thesegrounds the mortality in Prussia is 1 in 38; in Pomerania, 1 in 37-1/2; in theNeumark, 1 in 37; in the Churmark, 1 in 35; according to the lists for 1756.27[34_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_811]The nearest average measure of mortality for all countries, taking towns andvillages together, is, according to Susmilch, 1 in 36.28[34_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_809] But Crome thinks that thismeasure, though it might possibly have suited the time at which Susmilch wrote,is not correct at present, when in most of the states of Europe both the numberand the size of towns have increased.29[34_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_807] He seems to be of opinion,indeed that this mortality was rather below the truth in Susmilch’s time, andthat now 1 in 30 would be found to be nearer the average measure. It is notimprobable that Susmilch’s proportion is too small, as he had a little tendency,with many other statistical writers, to throw out of his calculations epidemickyears; but Crome has not advanced proofs sufficient to establish a generalmeasure of mortality in opposition to that proposed by Susmilch. He quotesBusching, who states the mortality of the whole Prussian monarchy to be 1 in30.30 [34_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_805] But it appears that thisinference was drawn from lists for only three years, a period much too short todetermine any general average. This proportion for the Prussian monarchy is,indeed, completely contradicted by subsequent observations mentioned by Crome.According to lists for five years, ending in 1784, the mortality was only 1 in37.31 [34_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_803] During the same periodthe births were to the deaths as 131 to 100. In Silesia the mortality from 1781to 1784, was 1 in 30; and the births to deaths as 128 to 100. In Gelderland, themortality from 1776 to 1781 was 1 in 27, and the births 1 in 26. These are thetwo provinces of the monarchy in which the mortality is the greatest. In someothers it is very small. From 1781 to 1784, the average mortality in Neuffchateland Ballengin, was only 1 in 44, and the births 1 in 31. In the principality ofHalberstadtz, from 1778 to 1784, the mortality was still less, being only 1 in45 or 46, and the proportion of births to deaths 137 to 100.32[34_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_813]The general conclusion that Crome draws, is, that the states of Europe may bedivided into three classes, to which a different measure of mortality ought tobe applied. In the richest and most populous states, where the inhabitants oftowns are to the inhabitants of the country, in so high a proportion as 1 to 3,the mortality may be taken as 1 in 30. In those countries, which are in a middlestate, with regard to population and cultivation, the mortality may beconsidered as 1 in 32. And in the thinly-peopled northern states, Susmilch’sproportion of 1 in 36 may be applied.33[34_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_2119]These proportions seem to make the general mortality rather too great, evenafter allowing epidemick years to have their full effect in the calculations.NOTES1 [34_V__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_772].

VI.Effects of Epidemicks on Tables of Mortality.IT appears clearly, from the very valuable tables of mortality which Susmilchhas collected, and which include periods of 50 or 60 years, that all thecountries of Europe are subject to periodical sickly seasons, which check theirincrease; and very few are exempt from those great and wasting plagues, which,once or twice, perhaps, in a century, sweep off the third or fourth part oftheir inhabitants. The way in which these periods of mortality affect all thegeneral proportions of births, deaths, and marriages, is strikingly illustratedin the tables for Prussia and Lithuania, from the year 1692 to the year 1757.1[35_VI__Effects_of_epidemicks_on_tab.html#id_817]The table, from which this is copied, contains the marriages, births, anddeaths, for every particular year during the whole period; but to bring it intoa smaller compass, I have retained only the general average drawn from theshorter periods of five and four years, except where the numbers for theindividual years presented any fact worthy of particular observation. The year1711, immediately succeeding the great plague, is not included by Susmilch inany general average; but he has given the particular numbers, and if they beaccurate, they shew the very sudden and prodigious effect of a great mortalityon the number of marriages.Susmilch calculates that above one third of the people was destroyed by theplague; and yet, notwithstanding this great diminution of the population, itwill appear, by a reference to the table, that the number of marriages in theyear 1711, was very nearly double the average of the six years preceding theplague.2 [35_VI__Effects_of_epidemicks_on_tab.html#id_815] To produce thiseffect, we must suppose, that almost all who were at the age of puberty wereinduced, from the demand for labour, and the number of vacant employments,immediately to marry. This immense number of marriages in the year, could notpossibly be accompanied by a great proportional number of births, because wecannot suppose that the new marriages could each yield more than one birth inthe year, and the rest must come from the marriages which had continued unbrokenthrough the plague. We cannot, therefore, be surprised, that the proportion ofbirths to marriages in this year should be only 2 and 7/10 to 1, or 27 to 10.But though the proportion of births to marriages could not be great; yet, onaccount of the extraordinary number of marriages, the absolute number of birthsmust be great; and as the number of deaths would naturally be small, theproportion of births to deaths is prodigious, being 320 to 100; an excess ofbirths, as great, perhaps, as has ever been known in America.TABLE I V.[../img/236_1.png]In the next year, 1712, the number of marriages must of course diminishexceedingly, because, nearly all who were at the age of puberty having marriedthe year before, the marriages of this year would be supplied principally bythose who had arrived at this age, subsequent to the plague. Still, however, asall who were marriageable had not probably married the year before, the numberof marriages, in the year 1712, is great in proportion to the population; and,though not much more than half of the number which took place during thepreceding year, is greater than the average number in the last period before theplague. The proportion of births to marriages in 1712, though greater than inthe preceding year, on account of the smaller comparative number of marriages,is, with reference to other countries, not great, being, as 3-6/10 to 1, or 36to 10. But the proportion of births to deaths, though less than in the precedingyear, when so very large a proportion of the people married, is, with referenceto other countries, still unusually great, being as 220 to 100; an excess ofbirths which, calculated on a mortality of 1 in 36, would double the populationof a country (according to Table II[33_IV__On_the_fruitfulness_of_marri.html#id_2493]. page 190) in 21-1/8 years.From this period the number of annual marriages begins to be regulated by thediminished population, and of course to sink considerably below the averagenumber of marriages before the plague, depending principally on the number ofpersons rising annually to a marriageable state. In the year 1720, about nine orten years after the plague, the number of annual marriages, either fromaccident, or the beginning operation of the preventive check, is the smallest;and it is at this time, as might be expected, that the proportion of births tomarriages rises very high. In the period from 1717 to 1721 the proportion, asappears by the Table, is 49 to 10; and, in the particular years 1719 and 1720,it is 50 to 10, and 55 to 10.Susmilch draws the attention of his readers to the fruitfulness of marriages inPrussia after the plague, and mentions the proportion of 50 annual births to 10annual marriages as a proof of it. There are the best reasons for supposing thatthe marriages in Prussia at this time, were very fruitful; but certainly thisproportion by itself is no proof of it, being evidently caused by the smallernumber of marriages taking place in the year, and not by the greater number ofbirths.3 [35_VI__Effects_of_epidemicks_on_tab.html#id_821] In the two yearsimmediately succeeding the plague, when the excess of births above the deathswas so astonishing, the births bore a small proportion to the marriages, and,according to the usual mode of calculating, it would have followed, that eachmarriage yielded only 2-7/10, or 3-6/10 children. In the last period of thetable, from 1752 to 1756, the births are to the marriages as 5 to 1, and in theindividual year 1756, as 6-1/10 to 1; and yet, during this period, the birthsare to the deaths only as 148 to 100; which could not have been the case, if thehigh proportion of births to marriages, had indicated a greater number of birthsthan usual, instead of a smaller number of marriages.The variations in the proportion of births to deaths in the different periods ofthe 64 years included in the table, deserve particular attention. If we were totake an average of the four years immediately succeeding the plague, the birthswould be to the deaths, in the proportion of above 22 to 10, which, supposingthe mortality to be 1 in 36, would double the population in less than 21 years.If we take the 20 years from 1711 to 1731, the average proportion of the birthsto deaths will appear to be about 17 to 10; a proportion which (according toTable II [33_IV__On_the_fruitfulness_of_marri.html#id_2493]. page 190) woulddouble the population in about 35 years. But if, instead of 20 years, we were totake the whole period of 64 years, the average proportion of births to deathsturns out to be but a little more than 12 to 10; a proportion which would notdouble the population in less than 125 years. If we were to include themortality of the plague, or even of the epidemick years 1736 and 1737, in tooshort a period, the deaths might exceed the births, and the population wouldappear to be decreasing.Susmilch thinks that instead of 1 in 36, the mortality in Prussia after theplague might be 1 in 38; and it may appear perhaps to some of my readers, thatthe plenty, occasioned by such an event, ought to make a still greaterdifference. Dr. Short has particularly remarked, that an extraordinaryhealthiness generally succeeds any very great mortality,4[35_VI__Effects_of_epidemicks_on_tab.html#id_819] and I have no doubt that theobservation is just, comparing similar ages together. But under the mostfavourable circumstances, infants under three years, are more subject to deaththan at other ages; and the extraordinary proportion of children which usuallyfollows a very great mortality, counterbalances the natural healthiness of theperiod, and prevents it from making much difference in the general mortality.If we divide the population of Prussia, after the plague, by the number ofdeaths in the year 1711, it will appear that the mortality was nearly 1 in 31,and was therefore increased, rather than diminished, owing to the prodigiousnumber of children born in that year. And, in general, we shall observe, that,from this cause, a great previous mortality produces a much more sensible effecton the births than on the deaths. By referring to the table, it will appear thatthe number of annual deaths regularly increases with the increasing population,and nearly keeps up the same relative proportion all the way through. But thenumber of annual births is not very different during the whole period, though,in this time, the population had more than doubled itself; and therefore theproportion of births to the whole population, at first, and at last, must havechanged in an extraordinary degree.On an average of the 46 years after the plague, the proportion of annual birthsto annual marriages is as 43 to 10, that is, according to the principles laiddown in the fourth chapter of this book, out of 43 children born, 20 of themlive to be married. The average proportion of births to deaths during thisperiod is 157 to 100. But to produce such an increase, on the supposition thatonly 20 children out of 43, or 2 out of 4-3/10 live to be married, eachmarriage, I am persuaded, for the reasons given in that chapter, must haveyielded 8 births.Crome observes, that when the marriages of a country yield less than 4 births,the population is in a very precarious state,5[35_VI__Effects_of_epidemicks_on_tab.html#id_823] and, like the other writers onthis subject, he estimates the number of children from each marriage by theproportion of yearly births to yearly marriages. But I should say, on thecontrary, that the population was in a more precarious state, when the yearlymarriages in these lists appeared to give more than four children. If less thanhalf of the born live to be married, which would then be the case, anextraordinary number of children to each marriage is necessary to produce anyconsiderable increase. In Prussia, the marriages were so fruitful, as to allowof a considerable mortality among the children, without stopping the increase;but this mortality in itself cannot be considered as a favourable sign; and, inother countries in which a rapid increase is going on, the proportion of yearlybirths to yearly marriages is generally not so high as 4 to 1, or, according tothe common mode of calculating, each marriage yields less than 4 children.In the Churmark of Brandenburgh, for 15 years after 1694, the proportion ofbirths to deaths was nearly 17 to 10, which, if it had continued, would havedoubled the population in 35 years; yet the proportion of yearly births toyearly marriages was only 37 to 10. In the whole period from 1692 to 1756, inwhich the population had actually more than doubled itself, notwithstanding manyepidemick years, this proportion was nearly the same, or about 37-1/2 to 10.6[35_VI__Effects_of_epidemicks_on_tab.html#id_829]In the dutchy of Pomerania from 1694 to 1756, the population had doubled itself,and the average proportion of yearly births to yearly marriages was 38 to 10.7[35_VI__Effects_of_epidemicks_on_tab.html#id_827]In the Newmark of Brandenburgh from 1694 to 1756, there were some periods ofrapid increase, though it was checked more frequently and effectually byepidemicks. In 30 years, to 1726, the average proportion of births to deaths was148 to 100, and the proportion of annual births to annual marriages 38 to 10. Inthe whole period, the births were to the deaths as 136 to 100, and theproportion of births to marriages the same as in the period of thirty years.8[35_VI__Effects_of_epidemicks_on_tab.html#id_2121]In Russia, we know that a very rapid increase is going forwards, though theproportion of annual births to annual marriages is only about 36 to 10. And, ifwe had lists for America, where the progress of population is still more rapid,I should expect to find that the proportion of annual births to annual marriageswas less than 4 to 1.9 [35_VI__Effects_of_epidemicks_on_tab.html#id_825]On the contrary, in Silesia, where the proportion of births to deaths is only 13to 10, and where consequently the progress of the population is not rapid, theproportion of yearly births to yearly marriages is 4-1/10 to 1, or 41 to 10.10[35_VI__Effects_of_epidemicks_on_tab.html#id_833] And in France, this proportionbefore the revolution, was 4-1/2 to 1, though the progress of population wasslower than in Silesia. In Corsica, the births are said to be to the marriagesas 5 to 1, though the population of Corsica cannot possibly be in a continuedstate of rapid increase. The proportion of births to deaths in Norway, isgreater than in Sweden, though in Norway the annual births are to the annualmarriages as 38 to 10, and in Sweden, as 41 to 10.It cannot therefore be said, that the population of a country is in a precariousstate when the proportion of yearly births to yearly marriages is less than 4 to1. Such a proportion is, on the contrary, favourable to population, and is foundto exist in many countries, where the increase of people is very rapid. Aproportion greater than 4 to 1 is in itself unfavourable to the progress ofpopulation, and though it may occasionally exist in countries which areincreasing rapidly, owing to an extraordinary fruitfulness of the marriages, yetit will be found more frequently in countries where the progress of populationis slow.I take every opportunity that occurs of illustrating this subject, because somany respectable writers have fallen into the error of estimating the number ofchildren produced by each marriage in the course of its duration, by theproportion of yearly births to yearly marriages, and I am willing to give amplereasons to the reader for differing from such united authority. All thesewriters themselves express their surprise at the results that the lists, whichthey thus make use of, give. Susmilch and Crome particularly remark, that theaverage of 4 or 4-1/2 children to a marriage, contradicts the experience we haveof the fruitfulness of particular women, many of whom bear above 12 children,11[35_VI__Effects_of_epidemicks_on_tab.html#id_831] though a considerable part ofthem may die in the rearing. And Wargentin takes notice of the smallness of thisnumber, in reference to the reputed fecundity of the Northern women.12[35_VI__Effects_of_epidemicks_on_tab.html#id_841]I feel strongly persuaded, that it has been principally owing to this error inthe mode of estimating the fruitfulness of marriages, that Dr. Price, and almostall the writers in political arithmetick, have so totally misapprehended theprinciple of population. If indeed this mode of calculation were just, the fearsof depopulation would really be well founded.When it appears, from the lists of any country, that the annual births are tothe annual marriages in a higher proportion than 4 to 1, that is, according tothe principles laid down, when less than half of the born live to be married, itcannot be determined from such a proportion alone, whether this effect arisesfrom a number of persons above the age of puberty dying unmarried, the operationof the preventive check; or from a considerable mortality among children, theoperation of the positive check. But the proportion of deaths and births willgenerally ascertain, to which class it ought to be referred. In Prussia, it isundoubtedly occasioned principally by the mortality among children; and it doesnot seem improbable, that where so many children are born to each marriage, manyshould perish for want of sufficient attention, though there might be no want offood. I think it is generally to be observed, that when the women in the lowerclasses of life marry very young, they not only have more children, but lose agreater proportion of them, than when they marry later, and from having asmaller number, are able to take better care of them. It appears, from a tablegiven by Susmilch, that in Prussia, during this period, half of the born diedunder 24.13 [35_VI__Effects_of_epidemicks_on_tab.html#id_839] And as not muchless than half of the born lived to be married, the marriages must have beenearly, and the preventive check could not have operated much.In Sweden, half of the born live to 33,14[35_VI__Effects_of_epidemicks_on_tab.html#id_837] and as about half, or ratherless, live to be married, the preventive check would operate much more than inPrussia, though still not to a great degree. In France, where a smallerproportion of the born lives to be married, the operation of the preventivecheck is probably not very different from what it is in Sweden, though I shouldthink that it was certainly rather less. According to Necker,15[35_VI__Effects_of_epidemicks_on_tab.html#id_835] the proportion of marriages tothe population in France is as 1 to 113-1/3.The operation of the preventive check is best measured by the proportion whichthe whole population bears to the yearly marriages,16[35_VI__Effects_of_epidemicks_on_tab.html#id_845] but though this proportion beobtained by multiplying the number of annual births in proportion to each annualmarriage, by the number of inhabitants in proportion to each annual birth; yetit does not follow that it will be small, because less than half of the bornlive to be married, or be great, because more than half of the born live to bemarried. In that part of the Prussian dominions included in the table that hasbeen given, and during the period there mentioned, less than half of the bornlived to be married, yet the proportion of annual marriages to the wholepopulation was as high as 1 to 92.17[35_VI__Effects_of_epidemicks_on_tab.html#id_843] In Norway, where more thanhalf of the born live to be married, the proportion of annual marriages to thewhole population is as low as 1 to 130. The reason is, that the proportion ofthe population to annual births, which is the multiplier, is, in the two cases,extremely different.In Norway, it is probable, that half of the born live to forty-three,forty-four, or above; and therefore, though rather more than half of the bornlive to be married, there will necessarily be many persons between the ages of20 and 44 living unmarried, that is, the preventive check will prevail to aconsiderable degree. In a part of the Pays de Vaud in Switzerland, half of theborn live to 45; and therefore if none married before 40, and all married whenthey reached that age, more than half of the born would live to be married; yetall being unmarried under 40, the preventive check might be said to prevail to avery great degree.It is evident, therefore, that we cannot infer the absence of the preventivecheck, because a considerable proportion of the born lives to be married. And itis equally evident, that we cannot infer the contrary.In Holland, it would appear from the registers, that more than half of the bornlive to be married;18 [35_VI__Effects_of_epidemicks_on_tab.html#id_853] yet,from the proportion of annual marriages, to the whole population in the Dutchvillages, mentioned before, it is clear, that the preventive check cannotoperate much. In the Churmark of Brandenburgh, from 1694 to. 1756, more thanhalf of the born lived to be married. But it appears from a table given bySusmilch, that, in the Churmark, half of the born die under 22.19[35_VI__Effects_of_epidemicks_on_tab.html#id_851] The marriages, therefore, musthave been very early indeed. And, from the proportion of the marriages, for theChurmark, which he has given in one place, it appears that it was greater incomparison of the whole population, than in any other country, which he hasmentioned, except Holland.20 [35_VI__Effects_of_epidemicks_on_tab.html#id_849]Still, however, if it be true, that half of the born die under 22, it is ratherdifficult to conceive that more than half should live to be married.There is one circumstance not yet noticed, which may contribute to smooth thisdifficulty, and which should be attended to in all cases. This is the number ofsecond and third marriages. In the dukedom of Pomerania, it was observed, duringa period of seven years, from 1748 to 1754, that out of 23,324 marriages, thatwere contracted, 6170 of them were between persons, one of which had beenmarried before, and 1214, between persons, both of which had been marriedbefore.21 [35_VI__Effects_of_epidemicks_on_tab.html#id_847] The whole of thelatter number, therefore, and half of the former, ought to be subtracted, inorder to find the number of the born which lived to be married. And, from thiscause, all the lists will give the proportion of the born which lives to bemarried, greater than the truth. In the present instance, probably, full as manyas half of the born died unmarried; and this correction, I am persuaded, oughtto be applied to the Dutch villages, in particular, where the proportion ofmarriages is so great, as it is difficult to conceive, that a mortality of 1 in23, should not destroy more than half of the born before they reach the age oftwenty. In addition to this, I have little doubt that many of the marriages inthe Dutch villages, are, as in towns, between persons not born in the place.There is a constant influx of strangers into all parts of Holland. It has beencalled the church-yard of Germany.For the periodical, though irregular, returns of sickly seasons, I refer thereader to the valuable tables of mortality which Susmilch has collected. Thecommon epidemical years that are interspersed throughout these tables, will not,of course, have the same effects on the marriages and births, as the greatplague in the table for Prussia; but in proportion to their magnitude, theiroperation will in general be found to be similar. From the registers of manyother countries, and particularly of towns, it appears, that the visitations ofthe plague were frequent at the latter end of the 17th, and the beginning of the18th centuries.In contemplating the plagues, and sickly seasons which occur in these tables,after a period of rapid increase, it is impossible not to be impressed with theidea that the number of inhabitants had, in these instances, exceeded the foodand the accomodations necessary to preserve them in health. The mass of thepeople would, upon this supposition, be obliged to live more hardly, and agreater number of them would be crowded together in one house; and these naturalcauses would evidently contribute to produce sickness, even though the country,absolutely considered, might not be crowded and populous. In a country, eventhinly inhabited, if an increase of population take place, before more food israised, and more houses are built, the inhabitants must be distressed for roomand subsistence. If, in the Highlands of Scotland, for the next ten or twelveyears, the marriages were to be either more frequent, or more prolifick, and noemigration were to take place, instead of five to a cottage, there might beseven, and this, added to the necessity of worse living, would evidently have amost unfavourable effect on the health of the common people.NOTES1 [35_VI__Effects_of_epidemicks_on_tab.html#id_816]. Susmilch, GottlicheOrdnung, vol. i. table xxi. p. 83, of the tables.2 [35_VI__Effects_of_epidemicks_on_tab.html#id_814]. The number of people beforethe plague, according to Susmilch’s calculation, (vol. i. ch. ix. sect. 173.)was 570,000; from which, if we subtract 247,733, the number dying in the plague,the remainder 322,267 will be the population after the plague; which, divided bythe number of marriages and the number of births for the year 1711, makes themarriages about one twenty-sixth part of the population, and the births aboutone tenth part. Such extraordinary proportions could only occur, in any country,in an individual year. If they were to continue, they would double thepopulation in less than ten years.3 [35_VI__Effects_of_epidemicks_on_tab.html#id_820].

N° vii. p. 25.) by Mr.Barton, entitled, Observations on the probability of life in the United States,which I have seen since this was written, I am not sure that I might not bedisappointed in the expectation here expressed. If, indeed, Mr. Barton’scalculations were to be considered as true for the United States in general, itwould appear that half of the born die under 13 or 14; and therefore half of theborn could not live to marry. But the fact is, that Mr. Barton’s calculations,which he applies generally, are merely taken from the town of Philadelphia, andone or two small towns or villages which are certainly not healthy. Our largestEuropean towns are, of course, not so healthy as Philadelphia, where it appearsthat half of the born die under 12 12, but many of our moderate towns are muchmore healthy. Mr. Barton’s calculations of a mortality of 1 in 45, atPhiladelphia, and 1 in 47 at Salem, certainly contradict his other estimates,and can therefore only have been taken for short periods, and rejectingepidemick years; indeed, he acknowledges the having made this kind of rejectionin one or two instances, and of course his calculations are not to be relied on.He mentions 6 12 births to a marriage, but his numbers give only 4 12: and,supposing this to be the true proportion of children to a marriage, if, at thesame time we were to suppose that half of the born die under 14, all increase inthe population of America would be impossible. On the whole, though we cannotimagine that the calculations in this paper are applicable to the United Statesin general, and that halfof the born die under 14, instead of living to 25 or 30and above, as in Europe; yet, if we suppose, that they imply a considerablemortality under puberty, we must believe that each marriage yields full as manyas 7 or 8 births, to account for the rapidprogress of population which we knowfor a certainty is going forwards in America.Dr. Franklin supposes 8 births to amarriage in America, and that half of the bornlive to marry, which probably isnot far from the truth.

Even from this measure,the inferences are not entirely to be depended upon, as it is liable to beinfluenced by the fruitfulness of marriages, and the proportion of thepopulation which is under the age of puberty. If all the marriages which takeplace in a country, be they few or many, take place young, and be consequentlyprolifick, it is evident that to produce the same proportion of births, asmaller proportion of marriages will be necessary; or with the same proportionof marriages a greater proportion of births will be produced. This latter caseseems to be applicable to France, where both the births and deaths are greaterthan in Sweden, though the proportion of marriages is nearly the same, or ratherless. And when in two countries compared, one of them has a much greaterproportion of its population under the age of puberty, than the other, it isevident, that any general proportion of annual marriages to the wholepopulation, will not imply the same operation of the preventive check amongthose of a marriageable age. It is, in part, the small proportion of thepopulation in towns under the age of puberty, as well as the influx ofstrangers, which makes it appear in the registers, that the preventive checkoperates less in towns than in the country; whereas there can be little doubt,that the number of unmarried persons of a marriageable age is the greatest intowns. The converse of this will of course be true, and consequently, in such acountry as America, where above half of the population is under sixteen, theproportion of yearly marriages to the whole population will not accuratelyexpress, how little the preventive check really operates. The subject isintricate, and requires some attention.17 [35_VI__Effects_of_epidemicks_on_tab.html#id_842].

Susmilch’s proportions andcalculations for the same countries, appear now and then a little to contradicteach other. This arises from their being formed at different periods. Theproportion of marriages to the population for the Churmark of Brandenburgh, from1700 to 1755, (vol. i. ch. iv. sec. lxxi. p. 141.) appears to be 1 in 90, and upto the year 1722, 1 in 87. But in another calculation, which includes only theperiod from 1738 to 1748, the proportion for the villages of the Churmark is 1in 109, and for the small towns, 1 in 98, (sec. lx, p. 129).The table, which makes half of the born in the Churmark die under 22, was notformed from the period when the increase was so rapid, and when the listsappeared to shew that above half of the born lived to be married.21 [35_VI__Effects_of_epidemicks_on_tab.html#id_846]. Susmilch, GottlicheOrdnung, vol. i. c. v. s. xc. p. 183."},{"pageContent":"CHAP. VII.Of the Checks to Population in Switzerland.THE situation of Switzerland, is, in many respects, so different from the otherstates of Europe; and some of the facts that have been collected respecting it,are so curious, and tend so strongly to illustrate the general principles ofthis work, that it seems to merit a separate consideration.About 35 or 40 years ago, a great and sudden alarm appears to have prevailed inSwitzerland, respecting the depopulation of the country; and the transactions ofthe Economical Society of Berne, which had been established some years before,were crowded with papers deploring the decay of industry, arts, agriculture, andmanufactures, and the imminent danger of a total want of people. The greaterpart of these writers considered the depopulation of the country as a fact soobvious as not to require proof. They employed themselvcs therefore chiefly inproposing remedies, and among others, the importation of midwives, theestablishment of foundling hospitals, the portioning of young virgins, theprevention of emigration, and the encouragement of foreign settlers.1[36_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_857]A paper, containing very valuable materials, was, however, about this timepublished, by a Mons. Muret, minister of Vevey, who, before he proceeded topoint out remedies, thought it necessary to substantiate the existence of theevil. He made a very laborious and careful research into the registers ofdifferent parishes up to the time of their first establishment, and compared thenumber of births which had taken place during three different periods of 70years each, the first ending in 1620, the second in 1690, and the third in1760.2 [36_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_855] Finding, upon thiscomparison, that the number of births was rather less in the second than in thefirst period, (and by the help of supposing some omissions in the second period,and some redundances in the third,) that the number of births in the third wasalso less than in the second, he considered the evidence for a continueddepopulation of the country from the year 1550, as incontrovertible.Admitting all the premises, the conclusion is not perhaps so certain as heimagined it to be, and, from other facts which appear in his memoir, I amstrongly disposed to believe, that Switzerland, during this period, came underthe case supposed in page 197, and that the improving habits of the people, withrespect to prudence, cleanliness, &c. had added gradually to the generalhealthiness of the country, and by enabling them to rear up to manhood a greaterproportion of their children, had furnished the requisite increase of populationwith a smaller number of births. Of course, the proportion of annual births tothe whole population, in the latter period, would be less than in the former.From accurate calculations of M. Muret, it appears, that, during the lastperiod, the mortality was extraordinarily small, and the proportion of childrenreared from infancy to puberty, extraordinarily great.3[36_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_861] In the former periods, thiscould not have been the case in the same degree. M. Muret himself, observes,that, “The ancient depopulation of the country was to be attributed to thefrequent plagues which in former times desolated it;” and adds, “if it couldsupport itself, notwithstanding the frequency of so dreadful an evil, it is aproof of the goodness of the climate, and of the certain resources which thecountry could furnish, for a prompt recovery of its population.”4[36_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_859] He neglects to apply thisobservation as he ought, and forgets that such a prompt repeopling could nottake place without an unusual increase of births, and that, to enable a countryto support itself against such a source of destruction, a greater proportion ofbirths to the whole population would be necessary than at other times.In one of his tables, he gives a list of all the plagues that had prevailed inSwitzerland, from which it appears, that this dreadful scourge desolated thecountry, at short intervals, during the whole of the first period, and extendedits occasional ravages to within 22 years of the termination of the second.5[36_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2123]It would be contrary to every rule of probability, to suppose, that, during thefrequent prevalence of this disorder, the country could be particularly healthy,and the general mortality extremely small. Let us suppose it to have been such,as at present takes place in many other countries which are exempt from thiscalamity, about 1 in 32, instead of 1 in 45, as in the last period. The birthswould, of course, keep their relative proportion, and instead of 1 in 36,6[36_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2125] be about 1 in 26. Inestimating the population of the country by the births, we should thus have twovery different multipliers for the different periods; and though the absolutenumber of births might be greater in the first period, yet the fact would by nomeans imply a greater population.In the present instance, the sum of the births in 17 parishes during the first70 years, is given as 49,860, which annually would be about 712. This,multiplied by 26, would indicate a population of 18,512. In the last period, thesum of the births is given 43,910,7[36_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_867] which will be about 626annually. This, multiplied by 36, will indicate a population of 22,536: and ifthe multipliers be just, it will thus appear, that, instead of the decreasewhich was intended to be proved, there had been a considerable increase.That I have not estimated the mortality too high, during the first period, Ihave many reasons for supposing, particularly, a calculation respecting theneighbouring town of Geneva, in which it appears, that in the 16th century, theprobability of life, or the age to which half of the born live, was only 4.883,rather less than four years and 9/10 ths; and the mean life 18.511, about 18years and a half. In the 17th century, the probability of life was 11.607, above11 years and a half; the mean life 23.358. In the 18th century, the probabilityof life had increased to 27.183, 27 years and nearly a fifth, and the mean lifeto 32 years and a fifth.8 [36_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_865]It is highly probable, that a diminution of mortality, of the same kind, though,perhaps, not in the same degree, should have taken place in Switzerland; and weknow from the registers of other countries, which have been already noticed, andmost particularly from that of Prussia, that the period of the greater mortalitynaturally produces a greater proportion of births.Of this dependence of the births on the deaths, M. Muret himself produces manyinstances; but not being aware of the true principle of population, they onlyserve to astonish him, and he does not apply them.Speaking of the want of fruitfulness in the Swiss women, he says, that Prussia,Brandenburgh, Sweden, France, and indeed every country, the registers of whichhe had seen, give a greater proportion of baptisms to the number of inhabitants,than the Pays de Vaud, where this proportion is only as 1 to 36.9[36_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_863] He adds, that, fromcalculations lately made in the Lyonois, it appeared, that in Lyons itself, theproportion of baptisms was 1 in 28; in the small towns, 1 in 25; and in theparishes, 1 in 23 or 24. What a prodigious difference, he exclaims, between theLyonois and the Pays de Vaud, where the most favourable proportion, and thatonly in two small parishes of extraordinary fecundity, is not above 1 in 26, andin many parishes it is considerably less than 1 in 40.10[36_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_871] The same difference, heremarks, takes place in the mean life. In the Lyonois, it is a little above 25years, while in the Pays de Vaud, the lowest mean life, and that only in asingle marshy and unhealthy parish, is 29-1/2 years, and in many places it isabove 45 years.11 [36_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2127]“But whence comes it,” he says, “that the country where children escape the bestfrom the dangers of infancy, and where the mean life, in whatever way thecalculation is made, is higher than in any other, should be precisely that, inwhich the fecundity is the smallest? How comes it again, that, of all ourparishes, the one which gives the mean life the highest, should also be the one,where the tendency to increase is the smallest?“To resolve this question, I will hazard a conjecture, which, however, I giveonly as such. Is it not, that, in order to maintain in all places the properequilibrium of population, God has wisely ordered things in such a manner, asthat the force of life, in each country, should be in the in-verse ratio of itsfecundity.12 [36_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2129]“In effect, experience verifies my conjecture. Leyzin (a village in the Alps)with a population of 400 persons, produces but a little above eight children ayear. The Pays de Vaud, in general, in proportion to the same number ofinhabitants, produces 11, and the Lyonois 16. But if it happen, that at the ageof 20 years, the 8, the 11, and the 16, are reduced to the same number, it willappear, that the force of life gives in one place, what fecundity does inanother. And thus the most healthy countries, having less fecundity, will notoverpeople themselves, and the unhealthy countries, by their extraordinaryfecundity, will be able to sustain their population.”We may judge of the surprise of M. Muret, at finding from the registers, thatthe most healthy people were the least prolifick, by his betaking himself to amiracle in order to account for it. But the nodus does not seem in the presentinstance to be worthy of such an interference.13[36_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_869] The fact may be accounted for,without resorting to so strange a supposition, as that the fruitfulness of womenshould vary inversely as their health.There is certainly a considerable difference in the healthiness of differentcountries, arising partly from the soil and situation, and partly from thehabits and employments of the people. When, from these, or any other causeswhatever, a great mortality takes place, a proportional number of birthsimmediately ensues, owing both to the greater number of yearly marriages, fromthe increased demand for labour, and the greater fecundity of each marriage,from being contracted at an earlier, and naturally a more prolifick, age.On the contrary, when, from opposite causes, the healthiness of any country orparish is extraordinarily great; if, from the habits of the people, no vent foran overflowing population be found in emigration, the absolute necessity of thepreventive check will be forced so strongly on their attention, that they mustadopt it, or starve; and consequently, the marriages being very late, the numberannually contracted will not only be small, in proportion to the population, buteach individual marriage will naturally be less prolifick.In the parish of Leyzin, noticed by M. Muret, all these circumstances appear tohave been combined in a very high degree. Its situation in the Alps, but yet nottoo high, gave it probably the most pure and salubrious air; and the employmentsof the people being all pastoral, were consequently of the most healthy nature.From the calculations of M. Muret, the accuracy of which there is no reason todoubt, the probability of life in this parish, appeared to be so extraordinarilyhigh as 61 years.14 [36_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_875] And theaverage number of the births, being, for a period of 30 years, almost accuratelyequal to the number of deaths,15[36_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_873] clearly proved, that thehabits of the people had not led them to emigrate, and that the resources of theparish for the support of population had remained nearly stationary. We arewarranted, therefore, in concluding, that the pastures were limited, and couldnot easily be increased, either in quantity or quality. The number of cattlewhich could be kept upon them, would of course be limited; and, in the samemanner, the number of persons required for the care of these cattle.Under such circumstances, how would it be possible for the young men who hadreached the age of puberty, to leave their father’s houses, and marry, till anemployment of herdsman, dairy-man, or something of the kind, became vacant bydeath. And as, from the extreme healthiness of the people, this must happen veryslowly, it is evident, that the majority of them must wait during a great partof their youth, in their bachelor state, or run the most obvious risk ofstarving themselves and their families. The case is still stronger than inNorway, and receives a particular precision from the circumstance of the birthsand deaths being so nearly equal.If a father had, unfortunately, a larger family than usual, the tendency of itwould be rather to decrease, than increase, the number of marriages. He might,perhaps, with economy, be just able to support them all at home, though he couldnot probably find adequate employment for them on his small property; but itwould evidently be long before they could quit him; and the first marriage amongthe sons would probably be after the death of the father; whereas, if he had hadonly two children, one of them might perhaps have married without leaving theparental roof, and the other, on the death of the father. And, in a generalview, it may be said, that the absence or presence of four grown up unmarriedpeople, will make the difference of there being room, or not, for theestablishment of another marriage and a fresh family.As the marriages in this parish would, with few exceptions, be very late, andyet, from the extreme healthiness of the situation, be very slowly dissolved bythe death of either of the parties, it is evident, that a very large proportionof the subsisting marriages would be among persons so far advanced in life, thatmost of the women would have ceased to bear children; and in consequence, thewhole number of subsisting marriages, was found to be, to the number of annualbirths, in the very unusual proportion of 12 to 1. The births were only about a49th part of the population; and the number of persons above sixteen, was to thenumber below that age, nearly as 3 to 1.16[36_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_879]As a contrast to this parish, and a proof how little the number of births can bedepended upon, for an estimate of population, M. Muret produces the parish ofSt. Cergue in the Jura, in which the subsisting marriages were, to the annualbirths, only in the proportion of 4 to 1, the births were a 26th part of thepopulation, and the number of persons above and below sixteen just equal.17[36_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_877]Judging of the population of these parishes, from the proportion of their annualbirths, it would appear, he says, that Leyzin did not exceed St. Cergue by aboveone fifth at most; whereas, from actual enumeration, the population of theformer turned out to be 405, and of the latter, only 171.18[36_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2131]I have chosen, he observes, the parishes where the contrast is the moststriking; but though the difference be not so remarkable in the rest, yet itwill always be found true, that, from one place to another, even at very smalldistances, and in situations apparently similar, the proportions will varyconsiderably.19 [36_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_883]It is strange, that, after making these observations, and others of the sametendency, which I have not produced, he should rest the whole proof of thedepopulation of the Pays de Vaud on the proportion of births. There is no goodreason for supposing that this proportion should not be different, at differentperiods, as well as in different situations. The extraordinary contrast in thefecundity of the two parishes of Leyzin and St. Cergue, depends upon causeswithin the power of time and circumstances to alter. From the great proportionof infants which was found to grow up to maturity in St. Cergue, it appearedthat its natural healthiness was not much inferior to that of Leyzin.20[36_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_881] The proportion of its birthsto deaths, was 7 to 4,21 [36_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2133] butas the whole number of its inhabitants did not exceed 171, it is evident, thatthis great excess of births could not have been regularly added to thepopulation during the last two centuries. It must have arisen, therefore, eitherfrom a sudden increase of late years in the agriculture, or trade, of theparish, or from a habit of emigration. The latter supposition I conceive to bethe true one, and it seems to be confirmed by the small proportion of adultswhich has already been noticed. The parish is situated in the Jura, by the sideof the high road from Paris to Geneva, a situation which would evidently tend tofacilitate emigration; and in effect, it seems to have acted the part of abreeding parish for the towns and flat countries, and the annual drain of acertain portion of the adults, made room for all the rest to marry, and to reara numerous offspring.A habit of emigration in a particular parish, will not only depend on situation,but probably often on accident. I have little doubt that three or four verysuccessful emigrations have frequently given a spirit of enterprize to a wholevillage; and three or four unsuccessful ones, a contrary spirit. If a habit ofemigration were introduced into the village of Leyzin, it is not to be doubtedthat the proportion of births would be immediately changed; and at the end oftwenty years, an examination of its registers might give results as differentfrom those at the time of M. Muret’s calculations, as they were then, from thecontrasted parish of St. Cergue. It will hence appear, that other causes besidesa greater mortality, will concur to make an estimate of population, at differentperiods, from the proportion of births, liable to great uncertainty.The facts which M. Muret has collected are all valuable, though his inferencescannot always be considered in the same light. He made some calculations atVevey, of a nature really to ascertain the question, respecting the fecundity ofmarriages, and to shew the fallacy of the usual mode of estimating it, thoughwithout this particular object in view at the time. He found that 375 mothers,had yielded 2093 children, all born alive, from which it followed, that eachmother had produced 5-10/12, or nearly six children.22[36_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_889] These, however, were allactually mothers, which every wife is not; but allowing for the usual proportionof barren wives at Vevey, which he had found to be 20 out of 478, it will stillappear that the married women, one with another, produced above 5-1/3 children.And yet this was in a town, the inhabitants of which, he seems to accuse of notentering into the marriage state at the period when nature called them, and whenmarried, of not having all the children which they might have.23[36_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_887] The general proportion of theannual marriages to the annual births in the Pays de Vaud is as 1 to 3.9,24[36_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2135] and, of course, according tothe common mode of calculation, the marriages would appear to yield 3.9 childreneach.In a division of the Pays de Vaud into eight different districts, M. Muretfound, that, in seven towns, the mean life was 36 years; and the probability oflife, or the age to which half of the born live, 37. In 36 villages, the meanlife was 37, and the probability of life 42. In nine parishes of the Alps themean life was 40, and the probability of life 47. In seven parishes of the Jura,these two proportions were 38 and 42: in 12 corn parishes, 37 and 40: in 18parishes among the great vineyards, 34 and 37: in 6 parishes of mixed vines andhills, 33-9/10 and 36: and in one marshy, 29 and 24.25[36_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_885]From another table, it appears, that the number of persons dying under the ageof puberty, was less than 1/5 in the extraordinary parish of Leyzin; and lessthan 1/4 in many other parishes of the Alps and the Jura. For the whole of thePays de Vaud it was about 1/3.26[36_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2137]In some of the largest towns, such as Lausanne and Vevey, on account of thenumber of strangers above the age of puberty settling in them, the proportion ofadults to those under 15, was nearly as great as in the parish of Leyzin, andnot far from 3 to 1. In the parishes from which there were not many emigrations,this proportion was about 2 to 1. And in those which furnished inhabitants forother countries, it approached more towards an equality.27[36_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_895]The whole population of the Pays de Vaud, M. Muret estimated at 113 thousand, ofwhich 76 thousand were adults. The proportion of adults, therefore, to thoseunder the age of puberty, for the whole country, was 2 to 1. Among these 76thousand adults, there were 19 thousand subsisting marriages, and consequently38 thousand married persons; and the same number of persons unmarried, though ofthe latter number nine thousand, according to M. Muret, would probably be widowsor widowers.28 [36_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2139] With such anaverage store of persons not in the actual state of marriage, amounting to thehalf of all the adults, there was little ground for apprehension, that anyprobable emigrations, or military levies, would affect the number of annualmarriages, and check the progress of population.The proportion of annual marriages to inhabitants in the Pays de Vaud, accordingto M. Muret’s tables, was only 1 to 140,29[36_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_893] which is even less than inNorway.All these calculations of M. Muret, imply the operation of the preventive checkto population in a very considerable degree, throughout the whole of thedistrict which he considered; and there is reason to believe, that the samehabits prevail in other parts of Switzerland, though varying considerably fromplace to place, according as the situation or the employments of the peoplerender them more or less healthy, or the resources of the country make room, ornot, for an increase.In the town of Berne, from the year 1583 to 1654, the sovereign council hadadmitted into the Bourgeoisie 487 families, of which 379 became extinct in thespace of two centuries, and in 1783 only 108 of them remained. During thehundred years, from 1684 to 1784, 207 Bernoise families became extinct. From1624 to 1712, the Bourgeoisie was given to 80 families. In 1623, the sovereigncouncil united the members of 112 different families, of which 58 only remain.30[36_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_891]The proportion of unmarried persons in Berne, including widows and widowers, isconsiderably above the half of the adults, and the proportion of those belowsixteen, to those above, is nearly as 1 to 3.31[36_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2141] These are strong proofs ofthe powerful operation of the preventive check.The peasants in the canton of Berne have always had the reputation of beingrich, and, without doubt, it is greatly to be attributed to this cause. A lawhas for some time prevailed, which makes it necessary for every peasant to provehimself in possession of the arms and accoutrements necessary for the militia,before he can obtain permission to marry. This at once excludes the very poorestfrom marriage; and a very favourable turn may be given to the habits of manyothers, from a knowledge that they cannot accomplish the object of their wishes,without a certain portion of industry and economy. A young man, who, with thisend in view, had engaged in service, either at home, or in a foreign country,when he had gained the necessary sum, might feel his pride rather raised, andnot be contented merely with what would obtain him permission to marry, but goon till he could obtain something like a provision for a family.I was much disappointed, when in Switzerland, at not being able to procure anydetails respecting the smaller cantons, but the disturbed state of the countrymade it impossible. It is to be presumed, however, that as they are almostentirely in pasture, they must resemble in a great measure, the alpine parishesof the Pays de Vaud, in the extraordinary health of the people, and the absolutenecessity of the preventive check; except where these circumstances may havebeen altered by a more than usual habit of emigration, or by the introduction ofmanufactures which has taken place in some parts.The limits to the population of a country strictly pastoral, are strikinglyobvious. There are no grounds less susceptible of improvement than mountainouspastures. They must necessarily be left chiefly to nature; and when they havebeen adequately stocked with cattle little more can be done. The greatdifficulty in these parts of Switzerland, as in Norway, is to procure asufficient quantity of fodder for the winter support of the cattle which havebeen fed on the mountains in the summer. For this purpose, every bit of grass iscollected with the greatest care. In places inaccessible to cattle, the peasantsometimes makes hay with crampons on his feet; grass is cut not three incheshigh, in some places, three times a year; and in the vallies, the fields areseen shaven as close as a bowling-green, and all the inequalities clipped aswith a pair of scissars. In Switzerland, as in Norway, for the same reasons, theart of mowing seems to be carried to its highest pitch of perfection. As,however, the improvement of the lands in the vallies must depend principallyupon the manure arising from the stock; it is evident, that the quantity of hayand the number of cattle, will be mutually limited by each other; and as thepopulation will of course be limited by the produce of the stock, it does notseem possible to increase it beyond a certain point, and that, at no greatdistance. Though the population, therefore, in the flat parts of Switzerland,has increased during the last century, there is reason to believe that it hasbeen stationary, in the mountainous parts. According to M. Muret, it hasdecreased very considerably in the Alps of the Pays de Vaud; but his proofs ofthis fact have been noticed as extremely uncertain. It is not probable that theAlps are less stocked with cattle than they were formerly: and if theinhabitants be really rather fewer in number, it is probably owing to thesmaller proportion of children, and to the improvement which has taken place inthe mode of living.In some of the smaller cantons, manufactures have been introduced, which, byfurnishing a greater quantity of employment, and, at the same time, a greaterquantity of exports for the purchase of corn, have, of course, considerablyincreased their population. But the Swiss writers seem generally to agree, thatthe districts where they have been established, have, upon the whole, sufferedin point of health, morals, and happiness.It is the nature of pasturage to produce food for a much greater number ofpeople than it can employ. In countries, strictly pastoral, therefore, manypersons will be idle, or at most be very inadequately occupied. This state ofthings naturally disposes to emigration, and has been a chief cause that theSwiss have been so much engaged in foreign service. When a father had more thanone son, it would rarely happen, that some of the rest did not enrol themselvesas soldiers, or emigrate in some other way.It is possible, though not probable, that a more than usual spirit ofemigration, operating upon a country, in which, as it has appeared, thepreventive check prevailed to a very considerable degree, might have produced atemporary check to increase at the period when there was such a universal cryabout depopulation. If this were so, it without doubt contributed to improve thecondition of the lower classes of people. All the foreign travellers inSwitzerland, soon after this time, invariably take notice of the state of theSwiss peasantry as superior to that of other countries. In a late excursion toSwitzerland, I was rather disappointed not to find it so superior as I had beentaught to expect. The greatest part of the unfavourable change might justly beattributed to the losses and sufferings of the people during the late troubles;but a part, perhaps, to the ill-directed efforts of the different governments toincrease the population, and to the ultimate consequences even of efforts welldirected, and for a time, calculated to advance the comforts and happiness ofthe people.I was very much struck with an effect of this last kind, in an expedition to theLac de Joux in the Jura. The party had scarcely arrived at a little inn at theend of the lake, when the mistress of the house began to complain of the povertyand misery of all the parishes in the neighbourhood. She said that the countryproduced little, and yet was full of inhabitants; that boys and girls weremarrying who ought still to be at school; and that, while this habit of earlymarriages continued, they should always be wretched, and distressed forsubsistence.The peasant, who afterwards conducted us to the source of the Orbe, entered morefully into the subject, and appeared to understand the principle of populationalmost as well as any man I ever met with. He said, that the women wereprolifick, and the air of the mountains so pure and healthy, that very fewchildren died, except from the consequences of absolute want; that the soil,being barren, was inadequate to yield employment and food for the numbers thatwere yearly growing up to manhood; that the wages of labour were consequentlyvery low, and totally insufficient for the decent support of a family; but thatthe misery and starving condition of the greater part of the society did notoperate properly as a warning to others, who still continued to marry and toproduce a numerous offspring which they could not support. This habit of earlymarriages might really, he said, be called le vice du pays; and he was sostrongly impressed with the necessary and unavoidable wretchedness that mustresult from it, that he thought a law ought to be made restricting men fromentering into the marriage state before they were forty years of age, and thenallowing it only with “des vielles filles,” who might bear them two or threechildren instead of six or eight.I could not help being diverted with the carnestness of his oratory on thissubject, and particularly, with his concluding proposition, which went farbeyond even my ideas respecting the necessity of the preventive check. He musthave seen and felt the misery arising from redundant population, most forcibly,to have proposed so violent a remedy. I found, upon inquiry, that he had himselfmarried very young.The only point in which he failed, as to his philosophical knowledge of thesubject, was, in confining his reasonings too much to barren and mountainouscountries, and not extending them into the plains; in fertile situations, hethought, perhaps, that the plenty of corn and employment might remove thedifficulty, and allow of early marriages. Not having lived much in the plains,it was natural for him to fall into this error; particularly, as in suchsituations, the difficulty is not only more concealed from the extensiveness ofthe subject; but is in reality less, from the greater mortality, naturallyoccasioned by low grounds, towns, and manufactories.On inquiring into the principal cause of what he had named the predominant viceof his country, he explained it with great philosophical precision. He said,that a manufacture for the polishing of stones, had been established some yearsago, which for a time had been in a very thriving state, and had furnished highwages and employment to all the neighbourhood; that the facility of providingfor a family, and of finding early employment for children, had encouraged, to agreat degree, early marriages; and that the same habit had continued, when, froma change of fashion, accident, and other causes, the manufacture was almost atan end. Very great emigrations, he said, had of late years taken place, but thebreeding system went on so fast, that they were not sufficient to relieve thecountry of its superabundant mouths, and the effect was such as he had describedto me, and as I had in part seen.In other conversations which I had with the lower classes of people in differentparts of Switzerland and Savoy, I found many, who, though not sufficientlyskilled in the principle of population, to see its effects on society, like myfriend of the Lac de Joux, yet saw them clearly enough, as affecting their ownindividual interests, and were perfectly aware of the evils which they shouldprobably bring upon themselves by marrying before they could have a tolerableprospect of being able to maintain a family. From the general ideas which Ifound to prevail on these subjects, I should by no means say that it would be adifficult task to make the common people comprehend the principle of population,and its effect in producing low wages and poverty.Though there is no absolute provision for the poor in Switzerland, yet eachparish generally possesses some seigneural rights, and property in land, for thepublic use, and is expected to maintain its own poor. These funds, however,being limited, will of course often be totally insufficient, and, occasionally,voluntary collections are made for this purpose. But the whole of the supplybeing comparatively scanty and uncertain, has not the same bad effects as theparish rates of England. Of late years much of the common lands belonging toparishes, has been parcelled out to individuals, which has, of course, tended toimprove the soil and increase the number of people; but, from the manner inwhich it has been conducted, it has operated perhaps too much as a systematicencouragement of marriage; and has contributed to increase the number of poor.In the neighbourhood of the richest communes, I often observed the greatestquantity of beggars.There is reason to believe, however, that the efforts of the Economical Societyof Berne to promote agriculture were crowned with some success, and that theincreasing resources of the country have made room for an additional population,and furnished an adequate support for the greatest part, if not the whole, ofthat increase which has of late taken place.In 1764, the population of the whole canton of Berne, including the Pays deVaud, was estimated at 336,689. In 1791, it had increased to 414,420. From 1764to 1777, its increase proceeded at the rate of 2000 each year; and, from 1778 to1791, at the rate of 3109 each year.32[36_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_897]NOTES1 [36_VII__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_856].

VIII.Of the Checks to Population in France.AS the tables of mortality in France, before the revolution, were not kept withpeculiar care, nor for any great length of time, and as the few, which have beenproduced, exhibit no very extraordinary results, I should not have made thiscountry the subject of a distinct chapter, but for a circumstance attending therevolution which has excited considerable surprise. This is, the undiminishedstate of the population, in spite of the losses sustained during so long anddestructive a contest.A great national work, founded on the reports of the Prefects in the differentdepartments, is at present in some state of forwardness at Paris, and, whencompleted, it may reasonably be expected to form a very valuable accession tothe materials of statistical science in general. The returns of all the Prefectsare not, however, yet complete; but I was positively assured by the person whohas the principal superintendence of them, that enough is already known, to becertain, that the population of the old territory of France has rather increasedthan diminished during the revolution.Such an event, if true, very strongly confirms the general principles of thiswork; and assuming it, for the present, as a fact, it may tend to throw somelight on the subject, to trace, a little in detail, the manner in which such anevent might happen.In every country, there is always a considerable body of unmarried persons,formed by the gradual accumulation of the excess of the number rising annuallyto the age of puberty, above the number of persons annually married. The stop tothe further accumulation of this body, is when its number is such, that theyearly mortality equals the yearly accessions that are made to it. In the Paysde Vaud, as appeared in the last chapter, this body, including widows andwidowers, persons who are not actually in the state of marriage, equals thewhole number of married persons. But in a country like France, where both themortality, and the tendency to marriage, are much greater than in Switzerland,this body does not bear so large a proportion to the population.According to a calculation in an Essai d’ une Statitisque Generale, published atParis in 1800, by M. Peuchet, the number of unmarried males in France between 18and 50 is estimated at 1,451,063, and the number of males, whether married ornot, between the same ages, at 5,000,000.1[37_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_905] It does not appear at whatperiod exactly this calculation was made. The number of unmarried persons seemsto be too great for any period after some years of the revolution had elapsed;and rather too small for the period before the revolution. Let us suppose,however, that this number of 1,451,063, expresses the collective body ofunmarried males of a military age at the commencement of the revolution.The population of France, before the beginning of the war, was estimated by theNational Assembly, at 26,363,074;2[37_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_903] and there is no reason tobelieve that this calculation was too high. Necker, though he mentions thenumber 24,800,000, expresses his firm belief that the yearly births, at thattime, amounted to above a million, and consequently, according to his multiplierof 25-3/4, that the whole population was nearly 26 millions,3[37_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_901] and this calculation was madeten years previous to the estimate of the National Assembly.Taking then the annual births at rather above a million, and estimating thatrather above 2/5 would die under 18, which appears to be the case from somecalculations of M. Peuchet,4 [37_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_899]it will follow, that 600,000 persons will annually arrive at the age of 18.The annual marriages, according to Necker, are 213,774;5[37_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_2143] but as this number is anaverage of ten years, taken while the population was increasing, it is probablytoo low. If we take 220,000, then 440,000 persons will be supposed to marry outof the 600,000 rising to a marriageable age; and consequently, the excess ofthose rising to the age of 18, above the number wanted to complete the usualproportion of annual marriages, will be 160,000, or 80,000 males. It is evident,therefore, that the accumulated body of 1,451,063, unmarried males, of amilitary age, and the annual supply of 80,000 youths of 18, might be taken forthe service of the state, without affecting, in any degree, the number of annualmarriages. But we cannot suppose that the 1,451,063 should be taken all at once,and many soldiers are married, and in a situation not to be entirely useless tothe population. Let us suppose 600,000 of the corps of unmarried males to beembodied at once; and this number to be kept up by the annual supply of 150,000persons, taken partly from the 80,000, rising annually to the age of 18, and notwanted to complete the number of annual marriages, and partly, from the 851,063remaining of the body of unmarried males which existed at the beginning of thewar.It is evident, that, from these two sources, 150,000 might be supplied eachyear, for ten years, and yet allow of an increase in the usual number of annualmarriages of above 10,000. It is true, that, in the course of the 10 years, manyof the original body of unmarried males will have passed the military age; butthis will be balanced, and, indeed, much more than balanced, by their utility inthe married life. From the beginning, it should be taken into consideration,that though a man of fifty be generally considered as past the military age, yetif he marry a fruitful subject, he may by no means be useless to the population;and in fact, the supply of 150,000 recruits each year, would be takenprincipally from the 300,000 males rising annually to 18, and the annualmarriages would be supplied, in great measure, from the remaining part of theoriginal body of unmarried persons. Widowers and bachelors of forty and fifty,who, in the common state of things, might have found it difficult to obtain anagreeable partner, would probably see these difficulties removed in such ascarcity of husbands; and the absence of 600,000 persons, would of course makeroom for a very considerable addition to the number of annual marriages. Thisaddition in all probability took place. Many, among the remaining part of theoriginal body of bachelors, who might otherwise have continued single, wouldmarry under this change of circumstances; and it is known, that a veryconsiderable portion of youths under 18, in order to avoid the militaryconscriptions, entered prematurely into the married state. This was so much thecase, and contributed so much to diminish the number of unmarried persons, that,in the beginning of the year 1798, it was found necessary to repeal the lawwhich had exempted married persons from the conscriptions; and those who marriedsubsequently to this new regulation, were taken indiscriminately with theunmarried. And though after this, the levies fell, in part, upon those who wereactually engaged in the peopling of the country; yet the number of marriagesuntouched by these levies might still remain greater than the usual number ofmarriages before the revolution; and the marriages which were broken by theremoval of the husband to the armies, would not probably have been entirelybarren.Sir Francis D’Ivernois, who had certainly a tendency to exggerate, and probablyhas exaggerated considerably, the losses of the French nation, estimates thetotal loss of the troops of France both by land and sea, up to the year 1799, ata million and a half.6 [37_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_909] Theround numbers which I have allowed, for the sake of illustrating the subject,exceed Sir Francis D’Ivernois’s estimate by six hundred thousand. He calculates,however, a loss of a million of persons more, from the other causes ofdestruction attendant on the revolution; but as this loss fell indiscriminatelyon all ages and both sexes, it would not affect the population in the samedegree, and will be much more than covered by the 600,000 men in the full vigourof life, which remain above Sir Francis’s calculation. It should be observedalso, that in the latter part of the revolutionary war, the militaryconscriptions were probably enforced with still more severity in the newlyacquired territories, than in the old state; and, as the population of these newacquisitions is estimated at 5 or 6 millions, it would bear a considerableproportion of the million and a half supposed to be destroyed in the armies.And, although the law, which facilitated divorces to so great a degree, beradically bad, both in a moral and political view, yet, under the circumstanceof a great scarcity of men, it would operate a little like the custom ofpolygamy, and increase the number of children in proportion to the number ofhusbands. In addition to this, the women without husbands do not appear all tohave been barren, as the proportion of illegitimate births is now raised to 1/12of the whole number of births, from 1/47,7[37_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_907] which it was before therevolution; and though this be a melancholy proof of the depravation of morals,yet it would certainly contribute to increase the number of births; and as thefemale peasants in France were enabled to earn more than usual during therevolution, on account of the scarcity of hands, it is probable, that aconsiderable portion of these children would survive.Under all these circumstances, it cannot appear impossible, and scarcely evenimprobable, that the population of France should remain undiminished, in spiteof all the causes of destruction which have operated upon it during the courseof the revolution, provided, that the agriculture of the country has been such,as to continue the means of subsistence unimpaired. And it seems now to begenerally acknowledged, that, however severely the manufactures of France mayhave suffered, her agriculture has increased rather than diminished. At noperiod of the war, can we suppose, that the number of embodied troops exceededthe number of men employed before the revolution in manufactures. Those who werethrown out of work by the destruction of these manufactures, and who did not goto the armies, would of course betake themselves to the labours of agriculture;and it was always the custom in France for the women to work much in the fields,which custom was probably increased during the revolution. At the same time, theabsence of a large portion of the best and most vigorous hands, would raise theprice of labour; and as, from the new land brought into cultivation, and theabsence of a considerable part of the greatest consumers,8[37_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_911] in foreign countries, theprice of provisions did not rise in proportion; this advance in the price oflabour would not only operate as a powerful encouragement to marriage, but wouldenable the peasants to live better, and to rear a greater number of theirchildren.At all times, the number of small farmers and proprietors in France was great;and though such a state of things be by no means favourable to the clear surplusproduce, or disposeable wealth, of a nation; yet, sometimes, it is notunfavourable to the absolute produce, and it has always a most powerful tendencyto encourage population. From the sale and division of many of the large domainsof the nobles and clergy, the number of landed proprietors has considerablyincreased during the revolution; and as a part of these domains consisted ofparks and chaces, new territory has been given to the plough. It is true, thatthe land tax has been not only too heavy, but injudiciously imposed. It isprobable, however, that this disadvantage has been nearly counter-balanced bythe removal of the former oppressions under which the cultivator laboured, andthat the sale and division of the great domains, may be considered as a clearadvantage on the side of agriculture, or, at any rate; of the gross produce,which is the principal point with regard to mere population.These considerations make it appear probable, that the means of subsistence haveat least remained unimpaired, if they have not increased, during the revolution;and a view of the cultivation of France in its present state, certainly rathertends to confirm this supposition.We shall not, therefore, be inclined to agree with Sir Francis D’Ivernois, inhis conjecture, that the annual births in France have diminished by one seventhduring the revolution.9 [37_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_923] On thecontrary, it is much more probable, that they have increased by this number. Theaverage proportion of births, to the population in all France, before therevolution, was, according to Necker, as 1 to 25-3/4.10[37_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_2145] It has appeared in thereports of some of the Prefects which have been returned, that the proportion inmany country places, was raised to 1 to 21, 22, 22-1/2, and 23;11[37_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_2147] and though these proportionsmight, in some degree, be caused by the absence of a part of the population inthe armies, yet I have little doubt that they are principally to be attributedto the birth of a greater number of children than usual. If, when the reports ofall the Prefects are put together, it should appear, that the number of birthshas not increased in proportion to the population, and yet, that the populationis undiminished; it will follow, either that Necker’s multiplier for the birthswas too small, which is extremely probable, as from this cause he appears tohave calculated the population too low; or that the mortality among those notexposed to violent deaths, has been less than usual, which, from the high priceof labour, and the desertion of the towns for the country, is not unlikely.According to Necker and Moheau, the mortality in France, before the revolution,was 1 in 30 or 30-1/8.12 [37_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_921]Considering that the proportion of the population which lives in the country,is, to that in the towns, as 3-1/2 to 1,13[37_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_919] this mortality isextraordinarily great, caused, probably, by the misery arising from an excess ofpopulation; and from the remarks of Arthur Young on the state of the peasantryin France,14 [37_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_917] which arecompletely sanctioned by Necker,15[37_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_915] this appears to have beenreally the case. If we suppose, that from the removal of a part of thisredundant population, the mortality should have decreased from 1 in 30, to 1 in35,16 [37_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_913] this favourable changewould go a considerable way in repairing the breaches made by war on thefrontiers.The probability is, that both the causes mentioned have operated in part. Thebirths have increased, and the deaths of those remaining in the country havediminished; so that, putting the two circumstances together, it will probablyappear, when the results of all the reports of the Prefects are known, that,including those who have fallen in the armies, and by violent means, the deathshave not exceeded the births in the course of the revolution.The returns of the Prefects are to be given for the year 9 of the republick, andto be compared with the year 1789; but if the proportion of births to thepopulation be given merely for the individual year 9, it will not shew withprecision the average proportion of births to the population during the courseof the revolution. In the confusion occasioned by this event, it is not probablethat any very exact registers should have been kept; but, from theory, I shouldbe inclined to expect, that, soon after the beginning of the war, and at otherperiods during the course of it, the proportion of births to the wholepopulation would be greater, than in 1800 and 1801. If it should appear by thereturns, that the number of annual marriages has not increased during therevolution, the circumstance will be obviously accounted for by theextraordinary increase in the illegitimate births, mentioned before in thischapter, which amount, at present, to one eleventh of all the births, instead ofone forty-seventh, according to the calculation of Necker before therevolution.17 [37_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_925]Sir Francis D’Ivernois observes, that “those have yet to learn the firstprinciples of political arithmetick, who imagine that it is in the field ofbattle and the hospitals, that an account can be taken of the lives which arevolution or a war has cost. The number of men it has killed, is of much lessimportance than the number of children which it has pre-vented, and will stillprevent, from coming into the world. This is the deepest wound which thepopulation of France has received.” – “Sup-“posing,” he says, that, of the wholenumber of men destroyed, only two millions had been united to as many females;according to the calculation of Buffon, these two millions of couples ought tobring into the world twelve millions of children, in order to supply, at the ageof thirty-nine, a number equal to that of their parents. This is a point ofview, in which the consequences of such a destruction of men becomes almostincalculable; because they have much more effect with regard to the twelvemillions of children, which they prevent from coming into existence, than withregard to the actual loss of the two millions and a half of men, for whom Francemourns. It is not till a future period, that she will be able to estimate thisdreadful breach.”18 [37_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_927]And yet, if the circumstances on which the foregoing reasonings are founded,should turn out to be true, it will appear, that France has not lost a singlebirth by the revolution. She has the most just reason to mourn the two millionsand a half of individuals which she may have lost, but not their posterity:because, if these individuals had remained in the country, a proportionatenumber of children, born of other parents, which are now living in France, wouldnot have come into existence. If, in the best governed country in Europe, wewere to mourn the posterity which is prevented from coming into being, we shouldalways wear the habit of grief.It is evident, that the constant tendency of the births, in every country, tosupply the vacancies made by death, cannot, in a moral point of view, afford theslightest shadow of excuse for the wanton sacrifice of men. The positive evilthat is committed, in this case, the pain, misery, and wide-spreading desolationand sorrow, that are occasioned to the existing inhabitants, can by no means becounterbalanced by the consideration, that the numerical breach in thepopulation will be rapidly repaired. We can have no other right, moral orpolitical, except that of the most urgent necessity, to exchange the lives ofbeings in the full vigour of their enjoyments, for an equal number of helplessinfants.It should also be remarked, that though the numerical population of France maynot have suffered by the revolution; yet, that if her losses have been in anydegree equal to the conjectures on the subject, her military strength cannot beunimpaired. Her population at present must consist of a much greater proportionthan usual of women and children; and the body of unmarried persons of amilitary age, must be diminished in a very striking manner. This, indeed, isknown to be the case, from the returns of the Prefects which have already beenreceived.It has appeared, that the point at which the drains of men will beginessentially to affect the population of a country, is, when the original body ofunmarried persons is exhausted, and the annual demands are greater than theexcess of the number of males rising annually to the age of puberty, above thenumber wanted to complete the usual proportion of annual marriages. France wasprobably at some distance from this point, at the conclusion of the war; but, inthe present state of her population, with an increased proportion of women andchildren, and a great diminution of males of a military age, she could not makethe same gigantic exertions which were made at one period, without trenching onthe sources of her population.At all times, the number of males of a military age in France, was small inproportion to the population, on account of the tendency to marriage,19[37_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_933] and the great number ofchildren. Necker takes particular notice of this circumstance. He observes, thatthe effect of the very great misery of the peasantry, is, to produce a dreadfulmortality of infants under three or four years of age; and the consequence is,that the number of young children will always be in too great a proportion tothe number of grown up people. A million of individuals, he justly observes,will, in this case, neither present the same military force, nor the samecapacity of labour, as an equal number of individuals in a country where thepeople are less miserable.20 [37_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_931]Switzerland, before the revolution, could have brought into the field, or haveemployed in labour appropriate to grown up persons, one third more in proportionto her population, than France, at the same period.It will be but of little consequence, if any of the facts or calculations whichhave been assumed in the course of this chapter, should turn out to be false.The reader will see, that the reasonings are of a general nature, and may betrue, though the facts taken to illustrate them may prove to be inapplicable.21[37_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_929]NOTES1 [37_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_904].

De l’Administration desFinances, tom. i. c. ix. p. 263.21 [37_VIII__Of_the_checks_to_populatio.html#id_928]. Since I wrote this chapterI have had an opportunity of seeing the Analyse des Procès Verbaux des ConseilsGeneraux de Departement, which gives a very particular, and highly curiousaccount of the internal state of France for the year 8. With respect to thepopulation, out of 69 departments, the reports from which are given, in 16, thepopulation is supposed to be increased; in 42, diminished; in 9, stationary; andin 2, the active population is said to be diminished, but the numerical toremain the same. It appears, however, that most of these reports are not foundedon actual enumerations; and without such positive data, the prevailing opinionson the subject of population, together with the necessary and universallyacknowledged fact, of a very considerable diminution in the males of a militaryage, would naturally dispose people to think that the numbers, upon the whole,must be diminished. Judging merely from appearances, the substitution of ahundred children, for a hundred grown up persons, would certainly not producethe same impression, with regard to population. I should not be surprised,therefore, if, when the enumerations for the year 9 are completed, it shouldappear, that the population, upon the whole, has not diminished. In some of thereports, l’aisance generale repandue sur le peuple, and la division des grandsproprietaires, are mentioned as the causes of increase; and almost universally,les mariages prematurès, and les mariages multipliées par la crainte des loixmilitaires, are particularly noticed.With respect to the state of agriculture, out of 78 reports, 6 are of opinionthat it is improved; 10, that it is deteriorated; 70 demand that it should beencouraged in general; 32 complain de la multiplicitè des defrichements; and 12demand des encouragements pour les defrichements. One of the reports mentions,la quantitè prodigieuse de terres vagues mise en culture depuis quelque tems, etles travaux multipliées, au de la de ce peuvent executer les bras employes enagriculture; and others speak of les defrichements multipliées qui ont eu lieudepuis plusieurs annèes, which appeared to be successful at first; but it wassoon perceived, that it would be more profitable to cultivate less, andcultivate well. Many of the reports notice the cheapness of corn, and the wantof sufficient vent for this commodity; and in the discussion of the questionrespecting the division of the biens communaux, it is observed, that “le partageen operant le defrichement de ces biens, a sans doute “produit une augmentationrèelle de denrèes, mais d’un autre cotè, les vaines pa-“tures n’existent plus,et les bestiaux sont peutètre diminuès.” On the whole, therefore, I should beinclined to infer, that though the agriculture of the country does not appear tohave been conducted judiciously, so as to obtain a large surplus produce, yetthat the absolute produce had by no means been diminished during the revolution,and that the attempt to bring so much new land under cultivation, hadcontributed to make the scarcity of labourers still more sensible. And if it beallowed, that the food of the country did not decrease during the revolution,the high price of labour, which is very generally noticed, must have operated asa most powerful encouragement to population among the labouring part of thesociety.The land tax, or contribution fonciere, is universally complained of; indeed, itappears to be extremely heavy, and to fall very unequally. It was intended to beonly a fifth of the net produce; but, from the unimproved state of agriculturein general, the number of small proprietors, and, particularly, the attempt tocultivate too much surface in proportion to the capital employed, it oftenamounts to a fourth, a third, or even a half. The state of agriculture in Francehas never been such, as to yield a surplus produce in proportion to the grossproduce, in any respect equal to what it yields in England; and, therefore, aland tax bearing the same relation to the gross produce, would cause a verydifferent degree of pressure in the two countries. And, when property is so muchdivided, that the rent and profit of a farm must be combined, in order tosupport a family upon it, a land tax must necessarily greatly impedecultivation; though it has little or no effect of this kind, when farms arelarge, and let out to tenants, as is most fequently the case in England. Amongthe impediments to agriculture mentioned in the reports, the two great divisionof lands from the new laws of succession is noticed. The partition of some ofthe great domains would probably contribute to the improvement of agriculture;but subdivisions of the nature here alluded to, would certainly have a contraryeffect, and would tend most particularly to diminish surplus produce, and make aland tax both oppressive and unproductive. If all the land in England weredivided into farms of 20l. a year, we should probably be more populous than weare at present; but, as a nation, we should be extremely poor. We should bealmost without disposeable revenue, and should be under a total inability ofmaintaining the same number of manufactures, or collecting the same taxes, as atpresent. All the departments demand a diminution of the contribution fonciere asabsolutely necessary to the prosperity of agriculture.Of the state of the hospitals, and charitable establishments, of the prevalanceof beggary, and the mortality among the exposed children, a most deplorablepicture is drawn in almost all the reports. From which, we should at first bedisposed to infer, a greater degree of poverty and misery among all the lowerclasses of people in general. It appears, however, that the hospitals andcharitable establishments lost almost the whole of their revenues during therevolution; and this sudden subtraction of support from a great number of peoplewho had no other reliance, together with the known failure of manufactures inthe towns, and the very great increase of illegitimate children, might produceall the distressing appearances described in the reports, without impeaching thegreat fact of the ameliorated condition of agricultural labourers in general,necessarily arising from the acknowledged high price of labour, and comparativecheapness of corn; and it is from this part of the society that the effectivepopulation of a country is principally supplied. If the poor’s rates of Englandwere suddenly abolished, there would undoubtedly be the most complicateddistress among those who were before supported by them; but I should not expect,that either the condition of the labouring part of the society in general, orthe population of the country, would suffer from it. As the proportion ofillegitimate children in France has risen so extraordinarily, as from 1 47 ofall the births to 1 11, it is evident that more might be abandoned in hospitals,and more out of these die than usual, and yet a more than usual number be rearedat home, and escape the mortality of these dreadful receptacles. It appearsthat, from the low state of the funds in the hospitals, the proper nurses couldnot be paid, and numbers of children died from absolute famine. Some of thehospitals, at last, very properly refused to receive any more.The reports, upon the whole, do not present a favourable picture of the internalstate of France; but something is undoubtedly to be attributed to the nature ofthese reports, which, consisting as they do of observations explaining the stateof the different departments, and of particular demands with a view to obtainassistance or relief from government, it is to be expected that they should leanrather to the unfavourable side. When the question is respecting the impositionof new taxes, or the relief from old ones, people will generally complain oftheir poverty. On the subject of taxes indeed, it would appear as if the Frenchgovernment must be a little puzzled. For though it very properly recommended tothe conseils generaux not to indulge in vague complaints, but to mentionspecifick grievances, and propose specifick remedies, and particularly not toadvise the abolition of one tax, without suggesting another; yet all the taxes,appear to me, to be reprobated and most frequently in general terms, without theproposal of any substitute. La contribution fonciere, la taxe mobiliare, lesbarrieres, les droits de douâne, all excite bitter complaints, and the only newsubstitute that struck me, was a tax upon game, which, being at present almostextinct in France, cannot be expected to yield a revenue sufficient to balanceall the rest. The work, upon the whole, is extremely curious, and as shewing thewish of the government to know the state of each department; and to listen toevery observation, and proposal, for its improvement, is highly creditable tothe ruling power. It was published for a short time, but the circulation of itwas soon stopped, and confined to the ministers, les conseils generaux, &c.Indeed the documents are evidently more of a private than of a publick nature,and certainly have not the air of being intended for general circulation.For the state of population in Spain, I refer the reader to the valuable, andentertaining travels of Mr. Townsend, in that country, in which he will oftenfind the principle of population very happily illustrated. I should have made itthe subject of a distinct chapter, but was fearful of extending this part of thework too much, and of falling, almost unavoidably, into too many repetitions,from the necessity of drawing the same kind of inference from so many differentcountries. I could expect, besides, to add very little to what has been so welldone by Mr. Townsend."},{"pageContent":"CHAP. IX.Of the Checks to Population in England.THE most cursory view of society in this country, must convince us, thatthroughout all ranks, the preventive check to population prevails in aconsiderable degree. Those among the higher classes, who live principally intowns, often want the inclination to marry, from the facility with which theycan indulge themselves in an illicit intercourse with the sex. And others aredeterred from marrying, by the idea of the expences that they must retrench, andthe pleasures of which they must deprive themselves, on the supposition ofhaving a family. When the fortune is large, these considerations are certainlytrivial; but a preventive foresight of this kind, has objects of much greaterweight for its contemplation as we go lower.A man of liberal education, with an income only just sufficient to enable him toassociate in the rank of gentlemen, must feel absolutely certain, that if hemarry, and have a family, he shall be obliged, if he mix in society, to rankhimself with farmers and tradesmen. The woman, that a man of education wouldnaturally make the object of his choice, is one brought up in the same habitsand sentiments with himself, and used to the familiar intercourse of a societytotally different from that to which she must be reduced by marriage. Can a maneasily consent to place the object of his affection in a situation sodiscordant, probably, to her habits and inclinations. Two or three steps ofdescent in society, particularly at this round of the ladder, where educationends and ignorance begins, will not be considered by the generality of people asa chimerical, but a real evil. If society be desirable, it surely must be free,equal, and reciprocal society, where benefits are conferred as well as received,and not such as the dependent finds with his patron, or the poor with the rich.These considerations certainly prevent a great number in this rank of life, fromfollowing the bent of their inclinations in an early attachment. Others,influenced either by a stronger passion, or a weaker judgment, disregard theseconsiderations; and it would be hard indeed, if the gratification of sodelightful a passion as virtuous love, did not sometimes more thancounterbalance all its attendant evils. But I fear that it must be acknowledged,that the more general consequences of such marriages are rather calculated tojustify, than to disappoint, the forebodings of the prudent.The sons of tradesmen and farmers, are exhorted not to marry, and generally findit necessary to comply with this advice, till they are settled in some businessor farm, which may enable them to support a family. These events may not,perhaps, occur till they are far advanced in life. The scarcity of farms is avery general complaint; and the competition in every kind of business is sogreat, that it is not possible that all should be successful. Among the clerksin counting houses, and the competitors for all kinds of mercantile andprofessional employment, it is probable, that the preventive check to populationprevails more than in any other department of society.The labourer who earns eighteen-pence or two shillings a day, and lives at hisease as a singleman, will hesitate a little, before he divides that pittanceamong four or five, which seems to be not more than sufficient for one. Harderfare, and harder labour, he would perhaps be willing to submit to, for the sakeof living with the woman that he loves; but he must feel conscious, that, shouldhe have a large family, and any ill fortune whatever, no degree of frugality, nopossible exertion of his manual strength, would preserve him from theheart-rending sensation of seeing his children starve, or of being obliged tothe parish for their support. The love of independence is a sentiment thatsurely none would wish to see eradicated; though the parish law of England, itmust be confessed, is a system of all others the most calculated gradually toweaken this sentiment, and in the end will probably destroy it completely.The servants who live in the families of the rich, have restraints yet strongerto break through in venturing upon marriage. They possess the necessaries, andeven the comforts, of life, almost in as great plenty as their masters. Theirwork is easy, and their food luxurious, compared with the work and food of theclass of labourers; and their sense of dependence is weakened by the consciouspower of changing their masters, if they feel themselves offended. Thuscomfortably situated at present, what are their prospects if they marry. Withoutknowledge, or capital, either for business, or farming, and unused, andtherefore unable, to earn a subsistence by daily labour, their only refuge seemsto be a miserable alehouse, which certainly offers no very enchanting prospectof a happy evening to their lives. The greater number of them, therefore,deterred by this uninviting view of their future situation, content themselveswith remaining single where they are.If this sketch of the state of society in England be near the truth, it will beallowed, that the preventive check to population operates with considerableforce throughout all the classes of the community. And this observation isfurther confirmed by the abstracts from the registers returned in consequence ofthe late Population Act. The results of these abstracts shew, that the annualmarriages in England and Wales, are to the whole population as 1 to 123-1/5,1[38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_937] a smaller proportion ofmarriages than obtains in any of the countries which have been examined, exceptNorway and Switzerland.In the earlier part of the last century, Dr. Short estimated this proportion atabout 1 to 115.2 [38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_935] It is probablethat this calculation was then correct, and the present diminution in theproportion of marriages notwithstanding an increase of population more rapidthan formerly, owing to the more rapid progress of commerce and agriculture, ispartly a cause, and partly a consequence, of the diminished mortality that hasbeen observed of late years.The returns of the marriages, pursuant to the late act, are supposed to be lessliable to the suspicion of inaccuracy, than any other parts of the registers.Dr. Short in his New Observations on Town and Country Bills of Mortality, says,he will “conclude with the observation of an eminent Judge of this nation, thatthe growth and increase of mankind is more stinted from the cautious difficultypeople make to enter on marriage, from the prospect of the trouble and expencesin providing for a family, than from any thing in the nature of the species.”And, in conformity to this idea, Dr. Short proposes to lay heavy taxes andfines, on those who live single, for the support of the married poor.3[38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2149]The observation of the eminent Judge is, with regard to the numbers which areprevented from being born, perfectly just; but the inference that the unmarriedought to be punished, does not appear to be equally so. It will not, I believe,be very far from the truth, to say, that, in this country, not more than half ofthe prolifick power of nature is called into action, and yet, that there aremore children born than the country can properly support.If we suppose that the yearly births were 1/20 part of the population, aproportion, which, for short periods, obtains frequently on the continent,4[38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_943] and constantly, perhaps, inmany parts of America; and allowing one third for the mortality under 20, whichis a moderate supposition, as, according to Dr. Short, this mortality, in someplaces, is only one fifth or one fourth;5[38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_941] then if all were to marry at20, which is by no means so early an age as is possible, 1/30th part of thepopulation would, in that case, marry annually; that is, there would be oneannual marriage out of 60 persons, instead of one marriage out of 123 persons,as is the case at present. It may fairly be said, therefore, that not more thanone half of the prolifick power of nature is called into action in this country.And yet, when we contemplate the insufficiency of the price of labour tomaintain a large family, and the quantum of mortality which arises directly andindirectly from poverty; and add to this, the crowds of children, which are cutoff prematurely in our great towns, our manufactories, and our workhouses, weshall be compelled to acknowledge, that if the number born annually, were notgreatly thinned by this premature mortality, the funds for the maintenance oflabour must increase with much greater rapidity than they have ever donehitherto in this country, in order to find work and food for the additionalnumbers that would then grow up to manhood.Those, therefore, who live single, or marry late, do not, by such conduct,contribute, in any degree, to diminish the actual population; but merely todiminish the proportion of premature mortality which would otherwise beexcessive; and consequently in this point of view do not seem to deserve anyvery severe reprobation or punishment.The returns of the births and deaths are supposed, on good grounds, to bedeficient, and it will therefore be difficult to estimate, with any degree ofaccuracy, the proportion which they bear to the whole population.If we divide the existing population of England and Wales, by the average ofburials for the five years ending in 1800, it would appear, that the mortalitywas only 1 in 49;6 [38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_939] but this isa proportion so extraordinarily small, considering the number of our great townsand manufactories, that it cannot be considered as approaching to the truth.Whatever may be the exact proportion of the inhabitants of the towns to theinhabitants of the country, the southern part of this island certainly ranks inthat class of states, where this proportion is greater than 1 to 3; indeed,there is ample reason to believe, that it is greater than 1 to 2. According tothe rule laid down by Crome, the mortality ought, consequently, to be above 1 in30;7 [38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_951] according to Susmilch,above 1 in 33.8 [38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_949] In theObservations on the Results of the Population Act,9 many probable causes ofdeficiency in the registry of the burials, are pointed out; but no calculationis offered respecting the sum of these deficiencies, and I have no data whateverto supply such a calculation. I will only observe, therefore, that if we supposethem altogether to amount to such a number, as will make the present annualmortality about 1 in 40, this must appear to be the lowest proportion of deathsthat can well be supposed, considering the circumstances of the country; and iftrue, would indicate a most astonishing superiority over the generality of otherstates, either in the habits of the people with respect to prudence andcleanliness, or in natural healthiness of situation.10[38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_947] Indeed, it seems to be nearlyascertained, that both these causes, which tend to diminish mortality, operatein this country to a considerable degree. The small proportion of annualmarriages mentioned before, indicates, that habits of prudence, extremelyfavourable to happiness, prevail through a large part of the community, in spiteof the poor-laws; and it appears from the clearest evidence, that the generalityof our country parishes are very healthy. Dr. Price quotes an account of Dr.Percival, collected from the ministers of different parishes, and taken frompositive enumerations, according to which, in some villages, only a 45th, a50th, a 60th, a 66th, and even a 75th part, dies annually. In many of theseparishes the births are to the deaths above 2 to 1, and in a single parish above3 to 1.11 [38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_945] These, however, areparticular instances, and cannot be applied to the agricultural part of thecountry in general. In some of the flat situations, and particularly those nearmarshes, the proportions are found very different, and in a few, the deathsexceed the births. In the 54 country parishes, the registers of which, Dr. Shortcollected, chusing them purposely in a great variety of situations, the averagemortality was as high as 1 in 37.12[38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_961] This is certainly much abovethe present mortality of our agricultural parishes, in general. The period whichDr. Short took, included some considerable epidemicks, which may possibly havebeen above the usual proportion. But sickly seasons should always be included,or we shall fall into great errors. In 1056 villages of Brandenburgh, whichSusmilch examined, the mortality for 6 good years, was 1 in 43; for 10 mixedyears, about 1 in 38-1/2.13 [38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_959] Inthe villages of England, which Sir F. M. Eden mentions, the mortality seems tobe about 1 in 47 or 48;14 [38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_957] andin the late returns pursuant to the Population Act, a still greater degree ofhealthiness appears. Combining these observations together, if we take 1 in 46,or 1 in 48, as the average mortality of the agricultural part of the countryincluding sickly seasons, this will be the lowest that can be supposed with anydegree of probability. But this proportion will certainly be raised to 1 in 40,when we blend it with the mortality of the towns, and the manufacturing part ofthe community, in order to obtain the average for the whole kingdom.The mortality in London, which includes so considerable a part of theinhabitants of this country, was, according to Dr. Price, at the time he madehis calculations, 1 in 20-1/4; in Norwich 1 in 24-1/2; in Northampton 1 in26-1/2; in Newbury 1 in 27-1/2;15[38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_955] in Manchester 1 in 28; inLiverpool 1 in 27-1/2,16 [38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_953] &c. Heobserves, that the number dying annually in towns is seldom so low as 1 in 28,except in consequence of a rapid increase produced by an influx of people atthose periods of life when the fewest die, which is the case with Manchester andLiverpool,17 [38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2151] and other veryflourishing manufacturing towns. In general he thinks, that the mortality ingreat towns may be stated at from 1 in 1918[38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_967] to 1 in 22 and 23; in moderatetowns, from 1 in 24 to 1 in 28; and, in country villages, from 1 in 40, to 1 in50.19 [38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_965]The tendency of Dr. Price to exaggerate the unhealthiness of towns may justly beobjected to these statements; but the objection seems to be only of weight withregard to London. The accounts from the other towns which are given, are fromdocuments which his particular opinions could not influence. It should beremarked, however, that there is good reason to believe, that not only London,but the other towns in England, and probably also country villages, were, at thetime of these calculations, less healthy than at present. Dr. William Heberdenremarks, that the registers of the ten years from 1759 to 1768,20[38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_963] from which Dr. Price calculatedthe probabilities of life in London, indicate a much greater degree ofunhealthiness than the registers of late years. And the returns pursuant to thepopulation act, even after allowing for great omissions in the burials, exhibitin all our provincial towns, and in the country, a degree of healthiness muchgreater than had before been calculated. At the same time I cannot but think,that 1 in 31, the proportion of mortality for London, mentioned in theObservations on the Results of the Population Act,21[38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2153] is smaller than the truth.Five thousand may not, perhaps, be enough to allow for the omissions in theburials; or, perhaps, the absentees in the employments of war and commerce, maynot be included in these omissions. In estimating the proportional mortality theresident population alone should be considered.There certainly seems to be something in great towns, and even in moderatetowns, peculiarly unfavourable to the very early stages of life; and the part ofthe community on which the mortality principally falls, seems to indicate, thatit arises more from the closeness and foulness of the air, which may be supposedto be unfavourable to the tender lungs of children, and the greater confinement,which they almost necessarily experience, than from the superior degree ofluxury and debauchery, usually, and justly, attributed to towns. A married pair,with the best constitutions, who lead the most regular and quiet life, seldomfind that their children enjoy the same health in towns as in the country.In London, according to former calculations, one half of the born died underthree years of age; in Vienna and Stockholm under two; in Man chester, underfive; in Norwich, under five; in Northampton, under ten.22[38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_975] In country villages, on thecontrary, half of the born live till thirty, thirty-five, forty, forty-six, andabove. In the parish of Ackworth, in Yorkshire, it appears, from a very exactaccount kept by Dr. Lee of the ages at which all died there for 20 years, thathalf of the inhabitants live to the age of 46,23[38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_973] and there is little doubt,that, if the same kind of account had been kept in some of those parishes beforementioned, in which the mortality is so small as 1 in 60, 1 in 66, and even 1 in75, half of the born would be found to have lived till 50 or 55.As the calculations respecting the ages to which half of the born live in towns,depend more upon the births and deaths which appear in the registers, than uponany estimates of the number of people, they are on this account less liable touncertainty, than the calculations respecting the proportion of the inhabitantsof any place which dies annually.To fill up the void occasioned by this mortality in towns, and to answer allfurther demands for population, it is evident, that a constant supply ofrecruits from the country is necessary, and this supply appears, in fact, to bealways flowing in from the redundant births of the country. Even in those towns,where the births exceed the deaths, this effect is produced by the marriages ofpersons not born in the place. At a time when our provincial towns wereincreasing much less rapidly than at present, Dr. Short calculated that 9/19 ofthe married were strangers.24 [38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2157]Of 1618 married men, and 1618 married women, examined at the WestminsterInfirmary, only 329 of the men, and 495 of the women, had been born in London.25[38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_971]Dr. Price supposes, that London, with its neighbouring parishes, where thedeaths exceed the births, requires a supply of 10,000 persons annually. Graunt,in his time, estimated this supply for London alone at 6000;26[38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_969] and he further observes, thatlet the mortality of the city be what it will, arising from plague, or any othergreat cause of destruction, that it always fully repairs its loss in twoyears.27 [38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2155]As all these demands, therefore, are supplied from the country, it is evident,that we should fall into a very great error, if we were to estimate theproportion of births to deaths for the whole kingdom, by the proportion observedin country parishes, from which there must be such numerous emigrations.We need not, however, accompany Dr. Price in his apprehensions, that the countrywill be depopulated by these emigrations, at least, as long as the funds for themaintenance of agricultural labour remain unimpaired. The proportion of births,as well as the proportion of marriages, clearly proves, that in spite of ourincreasing towns and manufactories, the demand on the country for people is byno means very pressing.If we divide the present population of England and Wales, by the average numberof baptisms for the last five years, it will appear, that the baptisms are tothe population, as 1 to very nearly 36;28[38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_983] but it is supposed, withreason, that there are great omissions in the baptisms; and it is conjectured,that these omissions are greater than in the burials. On this point, however, Ishould be inclined to think differently, at least, with respect to the lasttwenty years, though probably it was the case formerly. It would appear, by thepresent proportion of marriages, that the more rapid increase of population,supposed to have taken place since the year 1780, has arisen more from thediminution of deaths, than the increase of the births.Dr. Short estimated the proportion of births to the population of England as 1to 28.29 [38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_981] In the agriculturalreport of Suffolk, the proportion of births to the population was calculated at1 to 30. For the whole of Suffolk, according to the late returns, thisproportion is not much less than 1 to 33.30[38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_979] According to a correct accountof thirteen villages from actual enumerations, produced by Sir F. M. Eden, theproportion of births to the population was as 1 to 33; and from another account,on the same authority, taken from towns and manufacturing parishes, as 1 to27-3/4.31 [38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_977] If, combining allthese circumstances, and adverting, at the same time, to the acknowledgeddeficiency in the registry of births, and the known increase of our populationof late years, we suppose the true proportion of the births to the population tobe as 1 to 30; then, assuming the present mortality to be 1 in 40, as beforesuggested, we shall nearly keep the proportion of baptisms to burials, whichappears in the late returns. The births will be to the deaths as 4 to 3 or13-1/3 to 10, a proportion more than sufficient to account for the increase ofpopulation which has taken place since the American war, after allowing, forthose who may be supposed to have died abroad, and for a greater generalmortality, in the earlier part of this period.In the Observations on the Results of the Population Act, it is remarked, thatthe average duration of life in England appears to have increased in theproportion of 117 to 100,32 [38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_985]since the year 1780. So great a change, in so short a time, if true, would be amost striking phenomenon. But I am inclined to suspect, that the whole of thisproportional diminution of burials does not arise from increased healthiness,but is occasioned, in part, by the greater number of deaths which mustnecessarily have taken place abroad, owing to the very rapid increase of ourforeign commerce since this period; and to the great number of persons absent innaval and military employments, during the late war, and the constant supply offresh recruits necessary to maintain undiminished so great a force. A perpetualdrain of this kind, would certainly have a tendency to produce the effectobserved in the returns, and might keep the burials stationary, while the birthsand marriages were increasing with some rapidity. At the same time, as theincrease of population since 1780 is incontrovertible, and the present mortalityextraordinarily small, I should still be disposed to believe, that the greaterpart of the effect is to be attributed to increased healthiness.If we suppose, that the mortality about the year 1780 was 1 in 36, instead of 1in 40, as at present, this will be making a great allowance for increasedhealthiness, though not so much as the proportion of 117 to 100; and assumingthe proportion of births to have been nearly the same as at present, the birthsabout the year 1780, will appear to have been to the deaths, as 36 to 30, or 12to 10; a proportion, which, calculated on a mortality of 1 in 36, doubles thepopulation of a country, in 125 years,33[38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2159] and is, therefore, as great aproportion, as can be true for the average of the whole century. The highestestimates of our population do not make it double of what it was at therevolution.We must not suppose, however, that this proportion of births to deaths, or ofbirths and deaths to the whole population, continued uniform before 1780. Itappears from the registers of every country which have been kept for any lengthof time, that considerable variations occur at different periods. Dr. Short,about the middle of the century, estimated the proportion of births to deaths at11 to 10;34 [38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_989] and if the birthswere at the same time a twenty-eighth part of the population, the mortality wasthen as high as 1 in 30-4/5. We now suppose that the proportion of births todeaths is above 13 to 10; but if we were to assume this proportion as acriterion by which to estimate the increase of population for the next thirty orforty years, we should probably fall into a very gross error. The effects of thelate scarcities are strongly marked, in the returns of the Population Act, by adecrease of births, and an increase of burials, and should such seasonsfrequently recur, they would soon destroy the great excess of births which hasbeen observed during the last twenty years; and indeed we cannot reasonablysuppose, that the resources of this country should increase, for any longcontinuance, with such rapidity, as to allow of a permanent proportion of birthsto deaths as 13 to 10, unless, indeed, this proportion were principally causedby great foreign drains.From all the data that could be collected, the proportion of births, to thewhole population of England and Wales, has been assumed to be as 1 to 30; butthis is a smaller proportion of births than has appeared, in the course of thisreview, to take place in any other country, except Norway and Switzerland; andit has been hitherto usual with political calculators to consider a greatproportion of births, as the surest sign of a vigorous and flourishing state. Itis to be hoped, however, that this prejudice will not last long. In countriescircumstanced like America or Russia, or in other countries after any greatmortality, a large proportion of births may be a favourable symptom; but in theaverage state of a well-peopled territory, there cannot well be a worse signthan a large proportion of births, nor can there well be a better sign than asmall proportion.Sir Francis D’Ivernois very justly observes, that if the various states ofEurope kept and published annually an exact account of their population, notingcarefully in a second column the exact age at which the children die, thissecond column would shew the relative merit of the governments, and thecomparative happiness of their subjects. A simple arithmetical statement wouldthen, perhaps, be more conclusive, than all the arguments that could beadduced.”35 [38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_987] In the importanceof the inferences to be drawn from such tables, I fully agree with him: and tomake these inferences, it is evident, that we should attend less to the columnexpressing the number of children born, than to the column expressing the numberwhich survived the age of infancy and reached manhood; and this number will,almost invariably, be the greatest, where the proportion of the births to thewhole population is the least. In this point, we rank next after Norway andSwitzerland, which, considering the number of our great towns and manufactories,is certainly a very extraordinary fact. As nothing can be more clear, than thatall our demands for population are fully supplied, if this be done with a smallproportion of births, it is a decided proof of a very small mortality, adistinction on which we may justly pride ourselves. Should it appear from futureinvestigations, that I have made too great an allowance for omissions, both inthe births and in the burials, I shall be extremely happy to find, that thisdistinction which, other circumstances being the same, I consider as the suresttest of happiness and good government, is even greater than I have supposed itto be. In despotic, miserable, or naturally unhealthy countries, the proportionof births to the whole population will generally be found very great.According to one of Sir F. M. Eden’s calculations, taken from towns andmanufacturing parishes, the annual births are to the annual marriages as 3 to1.36 [38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_993] In 111 agriculturalparishes for 12 years, ending in 1799, the annual births are to the annualmarriages in the proportion of above 4 to 1.37[38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_991] From which it might appear,that, in our towns, more than half of the born live to be married, and in thecountry less. But for the reasons mentioned in page 187, the contrary isprobably true. In our towns, from the mortality that takes place in the earlystages of life, it is not to be doubted that less than half of the born live tobe married, and the great proportion of marriages is occasioned merely by newsettlers. In the country, on account of the emigrants that marry in otherplaces, more than half of the born live to be married, though, allowing forsecond and third marriages, probably not much more. But from what was said inpage 209, the degree in which the preventive check operates cannot be determinedby the proportion of the born which lives to be married; but depends upon theproportion of annual marriages, and the proportion of annual births to the wholepopulation; and till the first of these proportions rises from 1 in 123 to 1 in80, or 1 in 70, and the second from 1 in 30 to 1 in 24, 22 or 20, it cannot besaid, that the towns draw hard upon the country for population.If taking the towns and country together, and rejecting at present second andthird marriages and illegitimate children, we suppose, that accurately half ofthe born live to be married, then, according to table i[33_IV__On_the_fruitfulness_of_marri.html#page_185]. page 185, each marriagemust yield five births, in order to produce a proportion of births to deaths, as12-1/5 to 10. And if the proportion of our births to deaths be above this, or13-1/3 to 10, then, including all circumstances, it does not appear that we canallow less than 5-1/2 births to each marriage.In judging of the proportion of the born which lives to be married, by theproportion of annual births to annual marriages, the number of second and thirdmarriages, and the number of illegitimate children, tend to correct each other.The second and third marriages tend to give the proportion which lives to bemarried too great, and the illegitimate children too small. It must depend onthe particular circumstances of the country, which of these two causes ofirregularity preponderates.According to the late returns, it would appear, that, in this country,considerably more than half of the born live to be married; but when thedeficiency in the births is assumed to be such as is suggested in this chapter,the result is rather on the contrary side.On an average of the five years ending in 1780, the proportion of births tomarriages is 350 to 100. In 1760, it was 362 to 100, from which, an inference isdrawn, that the registers of births, however deficient, were certainly not moredeficient formerly, than at present.38[38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_995] But a change of this nature, inthe appearance of the registers, might arise from a cause totally unconnectedwith deficiencies. If from the acknowledged greater healthiness of the latterpart of the century, compared with the middle of it, a greater number ofchildren survived the age of infancy, a greater proportion of the born would ofcourse live to marry; and this circumstance would produce exactly the effectobserved in the registers. From what has already been said on this subject, thereader will be aware, that this change may take place without diminishing theoperation of the preventive check. If half of the born live to 40 instead of 30,it is evident, that a greater proportion might live to marry, and yet themarriages be later.It has been made a question, whether we have just grounds for supposing, thatthe registry of births and deaths was in general more deficient in the formerpart of the century, than in the latter part. It appears to me, that the latereturns tend to confirm the suspicion of former inaccuracy, and to shew that theregisters of the earlier part of the century, in every point of view, affordvery uncertain data on which to ground any estimates of past population. In theyears 1710, 1720, and 1730, it appears from the returns, that the deathsexceeded the births; and taking the six periods ending in 1750,39[38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1001] including the first half ofthe century, if we compare the sum of the births with the sum of the deaths, theexcess of the births is so small, as to be perfectly inadequate to account forthe increase of a million, which, upon a calculation from the births alone, issupposed to have taken place in that time.40[38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_999] Consequently, either theregisters are very inaccurate, and the deficiencies in the births greater thanin the deaths; or these periods, each at the distance of ten years, do notexpress the just average. These particular years may have been more unfavourablewith respect to the proportion of births to deaths than the rest; indeed one ofthem, 1710, is known to have been a year of great scarcity and distress. But ifthis suspicion, which is very probable, be admitted, so as to affect the sixfirst periods, we may justly suspect the contrary accident to have happened withregard to the three following periods ending with 1780, in which thirty years,it would seem by the same mode of calculation, that an increase of a million andan half had taken place.41 [38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_997] Atany rate it must be allowed that the three separate years, taken in this manner,can by no means be considered as sufficient to establish a just average; andwhat rather encourages the suspicion that these particular years might be morethan usually favourable with regard to births, is, that the increase of birthsfrom 1780 to 1785, is unusually small,42[38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2161] which would naturally takeplace, without supposing a slower progress than before, if the births in 1780had been accidentally above the average.On the whole, therefore, considering the probable inaccuracy of the earlierregisters, and the very great danger of fallacy, in drawing general inferencesfrom a few detached years, I do not think that we can depend upon any estimatesof past population, founded on a calculation from the births, till after theyear 1780, when every following year is given, and a just average of the birthsmay be obtained. As a further confirmation of this remark, I will just observe,that in the final summary of the abstracts from the registers of England andWales, it appears, that in the year 1790, the total number of births was248,774, in the year 1795, 247,218, and in 1800, 247,147.43[38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2163] Consequently, if we had beenestimating the population from the births, taken at three separate periods offive years, it would have appeared that the population during the last tenyears, had been regularly decreasing, though we have very good reason tobelieve, that it has increased considerably.In the Observations on the Results of the Population Act,44[38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_1003] a table is given of thepopulation of England and Wales throughout the last century calculated from thebirths; but, for the reasons given above, little reliance can be placed on it,and for an estimate of the population at the revolution, I should be inclined toplace more dependance on the old calculations from the number of houses.It must, indeed, have appeared to the reader, in the course of this work, thatregisters of births or deaths, excluding any suspicion of deficiencies, must atall times afford very uncertain data for an estimate of population. On accountof the varying circumstances of every country, they are both very precariousguides in this respect; but of the two, perhaps, the births still more so, thanthe deaths; though from the greater apparent regularity of the former, politicalcalculators have generally adopted them as the ground of their estimates, inpreference to the latter. Necker, in estimating the population of France,observes, that an epidemick disease, or an emigration, may occasion temporarydifferences in the deaths, and that therefore the number of births is the mostcertain criterion.45 [38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_2165] But thevery circumstance of the apparent regularity of the births in the registers willnow and then lead into the grossest errors. If in any country we can obtainregisters of burials for two or three years together, a plague or mortalepidemick will always shew itself, from the very sudden increase of the deathsduring its operation, and the still greater diminution of them afterwards. Fromthese appearances we should of course be directed not to include the whole of agreat mortality, in any very short term of years. But there would be nothing ofthis kind to guide us in the registers of births; and, after a country had lostan eighth part of its population by a plague, an average of the five or sixsubsequent years would probably shew an increase in the number of births, andour calculations would give the population the highest at the very time that itwas the lowest. This appears very strikingly, in many of Susmilch’s tables, andmost particularly in the table for Prussia and Lithuania, which I have insertedin chap. vi [35_VI__Effects_of_epidemicks_on_tab.html#page_202]. of this book,where, in the year subsequent to the loss of one third of the population, thebirths were considerably increased, and in an average of five years, but verylittle diminished; and this, at a time, when, of course, the country could havemade but a very small progress towards recovering its former population.We do not know indeed of any extraordinary mortality which has occurred inEngland since 1700; and there are reasons for supposing that the proportions ofthe births and deaths to the population during the last century, have notexperienced such great variations as in many countries on the continent; at thesame time it is certain, that the sickly seasons which are known to haveoccurred, would, in proportion to the degree of their fatality, produce similareffects; and the change which has been observed in the mortality of late years,should dispose us to believe that similar changes might formerly have takenplace respecting the births, and should instruct us to be extremely cautious inapplying any proportions which are observed to be true at present, to past orfuture periods.NOTES1 [38_IX__Of_the_checks_to_population.html#id_936].

The answers to the Population Act, have at lengthhappily rescued the question of the population of this country from theobscurity in which it has been so long involved, and have afforded some veryvaluable data to the political calculator. At the same time, it must beconfessed, that they are not so complete, as entirely to exclude reasonings andconjectures, respecting the inferences which are to be drawn from them. It isearnestly to be hoped, that the subject may not be suffered to drop after thepresent effort. Now that the first difficulty is removed, an enumeration, everyten years, might be rendered easy and familiar; and the registers of births,deaths, and marriages, might be received every year, or at least, every fiveyears.

X.Of the Checks to Population in Scotland and Ireland.AN examination, in detail, of the statistical account of Scotland, would furnishnumerous illustrations of the principle of population; but I have alreadyextended this part of the work so much, that I am fearful of tiring the patienceof my readers; and shall therefore confine my remarks in the present instance toa few circumstances which have happened to strike me.On account of the acknowledged omissions in the registers of births, deaths, andmarriages, in most of the parishes of Scotland, few just inferences can be drawnfrom them. Many give extraordinary results. In the parish of Crossmichael1[39_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1009] in Kircudbright, themortality appears to be only 1 in 98, and the yearly marriages 1 in 192. Theseproportions would imply the most unheard-of healthiness, and the mostextraordinary operation of the preventive check; but there can be little doubt,that they are principally occasioned by omissions in the registry of burials,and the celebration of a part of the marriages in other parishes.In general, however, it appears from registers that are supposed to be accurate,that in the country parishes the mortality is small; and that the proportions of1 in 45, 1 in 50, and 1 in 55, are not uncommon. According to a table of theprobabilities of life, calculated from the bills of mortality in the parish ofKettle, by Mr. Wilkie; the expectation of an infant’s life is 46.6,2[39_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1007] which is very high, and theproportion which dies in the first year is only 1/10. Mr. Wilkie further adds,that, from 36 parish accounts, published in the first volume, the expectation ofan infant’s life appears to be 40.3. But in a table, which he has produced inthe last volume, calculated for the whole of Scotland from Dr. Webster’s survey,the expectation at birth appears to be only 31 years.3[39_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1005] This, however, he thinks,must be too low, as it exceeds but little the calculations for the town ofEdinburgh.The Scotch registers appeared to be, in general, so incomplete, that the returnsof 99 parishes only, are published in the Population Abstract; and, if anyjudgment can be formed from these, they shew a very extraordinary degree ofhealthiness, and a very small proportion of births. The sum of the population ofthese parishes in 1801, was 217,873;4[39_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1015] the average of burials for 5years ending in 1800, was about 3815; and of births, 4928:5[39_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1013] from which it would appearthat the mortality in these parishes was only 1 in 56, and the proportion ofbirths 1 in 44. But these proportions are so extraordinary, that it is difficultto conceive, that they approach near the truth. Combining them with thecalculations of Mr. Wilkie, it will not appear probable, that the proportion ofdeaths and births in Scotland, should be smaller than what has been allowed forEngland and Wales; namely, 1 in 40 for the deaths, and 1 in 30 for the births;and it seems to be generally agreed that the proportion of births to deaths is 4to 3.6 [39_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_2167]With respect to the marriages, it will be still more difficult to form aconjecture. They are registered so irregularly, that no returns of them aregiven in the Population. Abstract. I should naturally have thought, from theStatistical Account, that the tendency to marriage in Scotland, was, upon thewhole, greater than in England; but if it be true, that the births and deathsbear the same proportion to each other, and to the whole population, in bothcountries, the proportion of marriages cannot be very different. It should beremarked, however, that, supposing the operation of the preventive check to beexactly the same, in both countries, and the climates to be equally salubrious,a greater degree of want and poverty would take place in Scotland, before thesame mortality was produced as in England, owing to the smaller proportion oftowns and manufactories in the former country than in the latter.From a general view of the statistical accounts, the result seeme clearly to be,that the condition of the lower classes of people in Scotland, has beenconsiderably improved of late years. The price of provisions has risen; but,almost, invariably, the price of labour has risen in a greater proportion; andit is remarked in most parishes, that more butcher’s meat is consumed among thecommon people than formerly; that they are both better lodged and betterclothed; and that their habits, with respect to cleanliness, are decidedlyimproved.A part of this improvement is probably to be attributed to the increase of thepreventive check. In some parishes, a habit of later marriages is noticed, andin many places, where it is not mentioned, it may be fairly inferred, from theproportions of births and marriages, and other circumstances. The writer of theaccount of the parish of Elgin,7[39_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1011] in enumerating the generalcauses of depopulation in Scotland, speaks of the discouragement to marriagefrom the union of farms, and the consequent emigration of the flower of theiryoung men of every class and description, very few of whom ever return. Anothercause that he mentions, is, the discouragement to marriage from luxury; atleast, he observes, till people are advanced in years, and then a puny race ofchildren are produced. “Hence, how many men of every description remain single,and how many young women of every rank are never married, who, in the beginningof this century, or even so late as 1745, would have been the parents of anumerous and healthy progeny.”In those parts of the country where the population has been rather diminished,by the introduction of grazing, or an improved system of husbandry whichrequires fewer hands, this effect has chiefly taken place; and I have littledoubt, that, in estimating the decrease of their population, since the end ofthe last, or the beginning of the present century, by the proportion of birthsat the different periods, they have fallen into the error which has beenparticularly noticed, with regard to Switzerland, and have, in consequence, madethe difference greater than it really is.8[39_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1019]The general inference on this subject, which I should draw from the differentaccounts is, that the marriages are rather later than formerly. There are,however, some decided exceptions. In those parishes where manufactures have beenintroduced, which afford employment to children as soon as they have reachedtheir 6th or 7th year, a habit of marrying early naturally follows; and whilethe manufacture continues to flourish and increase, the evil arising from it isnot very perceptible; though humanity must confess with a sigh, that one of thereasons why it is not so perceptible, is, that room is made for fresh families,by the unnatural mortality which takes place among the children so employed.There are other parts of Scotland, however, particularly the Western Isles, andsome parts of the Highlands, where population has considerably increased fromthe subdivision of possessions, and where, perhaps, the marriages may be earlierthan they were formerly, though not caused by the introduction of manufactures.Here, the poverty which follows is but too conspicuous. In the account ofDelting in Shetland,9 [39_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1017] it isremarked, that the people marry very young, and are encouraged to this by theirlandlords, who wish to have as many men on their grounds as possible toprosecute the ling fishery; but that they generally involve themselves in debtand large families. The writer further observes, that formerly there were someold regulations called country acts, by one of which, it was enacted, that nopair should marry unless possessed of 40l. Scots, of free gear. This regulationis not now enforced. It is said that these regulations were approved andconfirmed by the parliament of Scotland, in the reign of Queen Mary, or JamesVI.In the account of Bressay Burra and Quarff in Shetland,10[39_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1023] it is observed, that thefarms are very small, and few have a plough. The object of the proprietors is tohave as many fishermen on their lands as possible – a great obstacle toimprovements in agriculture. They fish for their masters, who either give them afee totally inadequate, or take their fish at a low rate. The writer remarks,that, in most countries the increase of population is reckoned an advantage, andjustly. It is, however, the reverse, in the present state of Shetland. The farmsare split. The young men are encouraged to marry without having any stock. Theconsequence is poverty and distress. It is believed that there is at present inthese islands, double the number of people that they can properly maintain.”The writer of the account of Auchterderran,11[39_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_2169] in the county of Fife, says,that the meagre food of the labouring man is unequal to oppose the effects ofincessant hard labour upon his constitution, and by this means his frame is worndown before the time of nature’s appointment, and adds, “That people continuevoluntarily to enter upon such a hard situation by marrying, shews how far theunion of the sexes, and the love of independence, are principles of humannature.” In this observation, perhaps, the love of independence had better havebeen changed for the love of a progeny.The island of Jura12 [39_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_2171] appearsto be absolutely overflowing with inhabitants in spite of constant and numerousemigrations. There are sometimes 50 or 60 on a farm. The writer observes, thatsuch a swarm of inhabitants, where manufactures and many other branches ofindustry are unknown, are a very great load upon the proprietors, and useless tothe state.Another writer13 [39_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1021] isastonished at the rapid increase of population, in spite of a considerableemigration to America in 1770, and a large drain of young men during the latewar. He thinks it difficult to assign adequate causes for it, and observes, thatif the population continue to increase, in this manner, unless some employmentbe found for the people, the country will soon be unable to support them. And inthe account of the parish of Callander,14[39_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1025] the writer says, that thevillages of this place, and other villages in similar situations, are filledwith naked and starving crowds of people, who are pouring down for shelter orfor bread; and then observes that whenever the population of a town or villageexceeds the industry of its inhabitants, from that moment the place mustdecline.A very extraordinary instance of a tendency to rapid increase, occurs in theregister of the parish of Duthil,15[39_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_2173] in the county of Elgin; andas errors of excess are not so probable, as errors of omission, it seems to beworthy of attention. The proportion of annual births to the whole population isas 1 to 12; of marriages, as 1 to 55; and of deaths the same. The births are tothe deaths as 70 to 15, or 4 to 1. We may suppose some inaccuracy respecting thenumber of deaths, which seems to err on the side of defect; but the veryextraordinary proportion of the annual births, amounting to 1/12 of the wholepopulation, does not seem to be easily liable to error; and the othercircumstances respecting the parish, tend to confirm the statement. Out of apopulation of 830, there were only 3 bachelors, and each marriage yielded 7children. Yet with all this, the population is supposed to have decreasedconsiderably since 1745; and it appears, that this excessive tendency toincrease, had been occasioned by an excessive tendency to emigrate. The writermentions very great emigrations; and observes, that whole tribes who enjoyed thecomforts of life in a reasonable degree, had of late years emigrated fromdifferent parts of Scotland, from mere humour, and a fantastical idea ofbecoming their own masters and freeholders.Such an extraordinary proportion of births caused evidently by habits ofemigration, shews the extreme difficulty of depopulating a country merely bytaking away its people. Take but away its industry, and the sourccs of itssubsistence, and it is done at once.It may be observed, that in this parish, the average number of children to amarriage is said to be 7, though, from the proportion of annual births to annualmarriages, it would appear to be only 4-2/3. This difference occurs in manyother parishes, from which we may conclude, that the writers of these accountsvery judiciously adopted some other mode of caculation, than the proportion ofannual births and marriages; and probably founded the results they give, eitheron personal inquiries, or researches into their registers, to find the number ofchildren which had been born to each mother in the course of her marriage.The women of Scotland appear to be prolifick. The average of 6 children to amarriage is frequent; and of 7, and even 7-1/2, not very uncommon. One instanceis very curious, as it appears as if this number was actually living to eachmarriage, which would of course imply, that a much greater number had been, andwould be, born. In the parish of Nigg,16[39_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1029] in the county of Kincardine,the account says, that there are 57 land families, and 405 children; which givesnearly 7-1/9 each; 42 fisher families, and 314 children; nearly 7-1/2 each. Ofthe land families, which have had no children, there were 7; of the fishers,none. If this statement be just, I should conceive that each marriage must haveyielded, or would yield, in the course of its duration, as many as 9 or 10births.When, from any actual survey, it appears, that there is about 3 living childrento each marriage, or 5 persons, or only 4-1/2 to a house, which are very commonproportions, we must not infer that the average number of births to a marriageis not much above 3. We must recollect that all the marriages, orestablishments, of the present year, are of course without children; all of theyear before, have only one; all of the year before that, can hardly be expectedto have as many as two, and all of the fourth year preceding will certainly, inthe natural course of things, have less than three. One out of five children isa very unusually small proportion to lose in the course of ten years; and afterten years, it may be supposed that the eldest begin to leave their parents; sothat if each marriage be supposed accurately to yield 5 births in the course ofits duration, the families which had increased to their full complement wouldonly have 4 children, and a very large proportion of those which were in thestages of increase would have less than three;17[39_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1027] and consequently, taking intoconsideration the number of families where one of the parents may be supposed tobe dead, I much doubt, whether in this case, a survey would give 4-1/2 to afamily. In the parish of Duthil,18[39_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_2175] already noticed, the numberof children to a marriage is mentioned as 7, and the number of persons to ahouse, as only 5.I have taken notice of this circumstance, to obviate an objection which mightperhaps appear to arise from the result of such surveys, to the proofs whichhave been adduced, that marriages are in general more prolifick than they havebeen usually supposed to be. The accounts of many of the parishes in Scotland,which mention 6, 7, and 7-1/2, as the average number of children to a marriagetend very strongly to confirm these proofs; and as in these same parishes, theproportion of annual births to annual marriages, is seldom above 3-1/2, 4, or4-1/2, to 1; they prove at the same time the fallacy of this mode of estimatingthe fruitfulness of marriages. In those parishes where the authors have adoptedthis mode, they generally mention, as might be expected, 3, 3-1/2, 4, and 4-1/2,as the average number of children to a marriage.The poor of Scotland are in general supported by voluntary contributions,distributed under the inspection of the minister of the parish; and it appears,upon the whole, that they have been conducted with considerable judgment. Havingno claim of right to relief, and the supplies, from the mode of theircollection, being necessarily uncertain, and never abundant, the poor haveconsidered them merely as a last resource in cases of extreme distress, and notas a fund on which they might safely rely, and an adequate portion of whichbelonged to them by the laws of their country, in all difficulties.The consequence of this is, that the common people make very considerableexertions to avoid the necessity of applying for such a scanty and precariousrelief. It is observed, in many of the accounts, that they seldom fail of makinga provision for sickness and for age; and in general, the grown-up children andrelations of persons, who are in danger of falling upon the parish, stepforward, if they be in any way able, to prevent such a degradation, which isuniversally considered as a disgrace to the family.The writers of the accounts of the different parishes, frequently reprobate, invery strong terms, the system of English assessments for the poor, and give adecided preference to the Scotch mode of relief. In the account of Paisley,19[39_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1031] though a manufacturing town,and with a numerous poor, the author still reprobates the English system, andmakes an observation on this subject, in which, perhaps, he goes too far. Hesays, that though there are in no country such large contributions for the pooras in England, yet there is no where so great a number of them; and theircondition, in comparison of the poor of other countries, is truly mostmiserable.In the account of Caerlaverock,20[39_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_2177] in answer to the question,How ought the poor to be supplied? it is most judiciously remarked, “thatdistress and poverty multiply in proportion to the funds created to relievethem; that the measures of charity ought to remain invisible, till the momentwhen it is necessary that they should be distributed; that in the countryparishes of Scotland, in general, small occasional voluntary collections aresufficient; that the legislature has no occasion to interfere to augment thestream which is already copious enough; in fine, that the establishment of apoors rate would not only be unnecessary, but hurtful, as it would tend tooppress the landholder, without bringing relief on the poor.”These, upon the whole, appear to be the prevailing opinions of the clergy ofScotland. There are, however, some exceptions; and the system of assessments issometimes approved, and the establishment of it proposed. But this is not to bewondered at. In many of these parishes, the experiment had never been made; andwithout being thoroughly aware of the principle of population, from theory, orhaving fully seen the evils of poor laws, in practice, nothing seems, on a firstview of the subject, more natural, than the proposal of an assessment, to whichthe uncharitable, as well as the charitable, should be made to contribute,according to their abilities, and which might be increased or diminished,according to the wants of the moment.The endemick and epidemick diseases in Scotland, fall chiefly, as is usual, onthe poor. The scurvy is in some places extremely troublesome and inveterate; andin others it arises to a contagious leprosy, the effects of which are alwaysdreadful, and not unfrequently mortal. One writer calls it the scourge and baneof human nature.21 [39_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1033] It isgenerally attributed to cold and wet situations, meagre and unwholesome food,impure air from damp and crowded houses, indolent habits, and the want ofattention to cleanliness.To the same causes, in great measure, are attributed the rheumatisms which aregeneral, and the consumptions which are frequent among the common people.Whenever, in any place, from particular circumstances, the condition of the poorhas been rendered worse, these disorders, particularly the latter, have beenobserved to prevail with greater force.Low nervous fevers, and others of a more violent and fatal nature, arefrequently epidemick, and sometimes take off considerable numbers; but the mostfatal epidemick, since the extinction of the plague, which formerly visitedScotland, is the small-pox, the returns of which, are, in many places, atregular intervals; in others, irregular, but seldom at a greater distance than 7or 8 years. Its ravages are dreadful, though in some parishes not so fatal asthey were some time ago. The prejudices against inoculation are still great; andas the mode of treatment must almost necessarily be bad, in small and crowdedhouses, and the custom of visiting each other during the disorder still subsistsin many places, it may be imagined that the mortality must be considerable, andthe children of the poor the principal sufferers. In some parishes of theWestern Isles, and the Highlands, the number of persons to a house has increasedfrom 4-1/2, and 5, to 6-1/2, and 7. It is evident, that if such a considerableincrease, without the proper accommodations for it, do not absolutely generatethe disease, it must give to its devastations tenfold force when it arrives.Scotland has at all times been subject to years of scarcity, and occasionallyeven to dreadful famines. The years 1635, 1680, 1688, the concluding years ofthe seventeenth century, the years 1740, 1756, 1766, 1778, 1782, and 1783, areall mentioned in different places, as years of very great sufferings from want.In the year 1680, so many families perished from this cause, that, for sixmiles, in a well-inhabited extent, there was not a smoke remaining.22[39_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1037] The seven years at the end ofthe seventeenth century were called the ill years. The writer of the account ofthe parish of Montquhitter,23 [39_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_2179]says, that of 16 families on a farm in that neighbourhood, 13 were extinguished;and on another, out of 169 individuals, only 3 families, the proprietorsincluded, survived. Extensive farms, now containing a hundred souls, beingentirely desolated, were converted into a sheep walk. The inhabitants of theparish in general were diminished by death to one half, or as some affirm to onefourth, of the preceding number. Until 1709 many farms were waste. In 1740,another season of scarcity occurred, and the utmost misery was felt by the poor,though it fell short of death. Many offered in vain to serve for their bread.Stout men accepted thankfully twopence a day in full for their work. Greatdistress was also suffered in 1782 and 1783, but none died. “If, at thiscritical period,” the author says, “the American war had not ceased; if thecopious magazines, particularly of pease, provided for the navy, had not beenbrought to sale, what a scene of desolation and horror would have been exhibitedin this country!”Many similar descriptions occur in different parts of the Statistical Account;but these will be sufficient to shew the nature and intensity of the distresswhich has been occasionally felt from want.The year 1783 depopulated some parts of the Highlands, and is mentioned as thereason why in these places the number of people was found to have diminishedsince Dr. Webster’s survey. Most of the small farmers in general, as might beexpected, were absolutely ruined by the scarcity; and those of this description,in the Highlands, were obliged to emigrate to the Lowlands as commonlabourers,24 [39_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1035] in search of aprecarious support. In some parishes at the time of the last survey, the effectof the ruin of the farmers during this bad year, was still visible in theirdepressed condition, and the increased poverty and misery of the common peoplewhich is a necessary consequence of it.In the account of the parish of Grange,25[39_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1039] in the county of Banff, it isobserved, that the year 1783 put a stop to all improvements by green crops, andmade the farmers think of nothing but raising grain. Tenants were most of themruined. Before this period, consumptions were not near so frequent as they havebeen since. This may be justly attributed to the effects of the scarcity and badvictual in the year 1783, to the long inclement harvests in 1782 and 1787, inboth which seasons, the labourers were exposed to much cold and wet during thethree months that the harvests continued; but principally to the change that hasof late taken place in the manner of living among the lower ranks. Formerlyevery householder could command a draught of small beer, and killed a sheep nowand then, out of his own little flock; but now the case is different. Thefrequent want of the necessaries of life among the poor, their damp and stinkinghouses, and dejection of mind among the middling classes, appear to be theprincipal causes of the prevailing distempers, and mortality of this parish.Young people are cut off by consumptions, and the more advanced by dropsies andnervous fevers.The state of this parish, which, though there are others like it, may beconsidered as an exception to the average state of Scotland, was, without doubt,occasioned by the ruin of the tenants; and the effect is not to be wondered at,as no greater evil can easily happen to a country, than the loss of agriculturalstock and capital.We may observe, that the diseases of this parish are said to have increased, inconsequence of the scarcity and bad victual of 1783. The same circumstance isnoticed in many other parishes, and it is remarked, that though few people diedof absolute famine, yet that mortal diseases almost universally followed.It is remarked, also, in some parishes, that the number of births and marriagesare affected by years of scarcity and plenty.Of the parish of Dingwall,26 [39_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_2181]in the county of Ross, it is observed, that, after the scarcity of 1783, thebirths were 16 below the average, and 14 below the lowest number of late years.The year 1787 was a year of plenty, and the following year the births increasedin a similar proportion, and were 17 above the average, and 11 above the highestof the other years.In the account of Dunrossness,27[39_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1043] in Orkney, the writer says,that the annual number of marriages depends much on the seasons. In good yearsthey may amount to thirty or upwards; but when crops fail, will hardly come upto the half of that number.The whole increase of Scotland since the time of Dr. Webster’s survey in 1755,is about 260,000,28 [39_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1041] for whicha proportionate provision has been made in the improved state of agriculture andmanufactures, and in the increased cultivation of potatoes, which in some placesform two-thirds of the diet of the common people. It has been calculated thatthe half of the surplus of births in Scotland is drawn off in emigrations; andit cannot be doubted that this drain tends greatly to relieve the country, andto improve the condition of those which remain. Scotland is certainly stillover-peopled, but not so much as it was a century or half a century ago, when itcontained fewer inhabitants.The details of the population of Ireland are but little known. I shall onlyobserve, therefore, that the extended use of potatoes, has allowed of a veryrapid increase of it during the last century. But the cheapness of thisnourishing root, and the small piece of ground, which, under this kind ofcultivation, will, in average years, produce the food for a family, joined tothe ignorance and barbarism of the people, which have prompted them to followtheir inclinations with no other prospect than an immediate bare subsistence,have encouraged marriage to such a degree, that the population is pushed muchbeyond the industry and present resources of the country; and the consequencenaturally is, that the lower classes of people are in the most depressed andmiserable state. The checks to the population are of course chiefly of thepositive kind, and arise from the diseases occasioned by squalid poverty, bydamp and wretched cabins, by bad and insufficient clothing, by the filth oftheir persons, and occasional want. To these positive checks, have, of lateyears, been added the vice and misery of intestine commotion, of civil war, andof martial law.All the checks to population which have been observed to prevail in society, inthe course of this review of it, are clearly resolvable into moral restraint,vice, and misery.NOTES1 [39_X__Of_the_checks_to_population_i.html#id_1008].

XI.General deductions from the preceding view of Society.THAT the checks, which have been mentioned, are the true causes of the slowincrease of population, and that these checks result principally from aninsufficiency of subsistence, will be evident from the comparatively rapidincrease, which has invariably taken place, whenever, by some sudden enlargementin the means of subsistence, these checks have been in any considerable degreeremoved.It has been universally remarked, that all new colonies, settled in healthycountries, where room and food were abundant, have constantly made a rapidprogress in population. Many of the colonies from antient Greece, in the courseof one or two centuries, appear to have rivalled, and even surpassed, theirmother cities. Syracuse and Agrigentum in Sicily; Tarentum and Locri in Italy;Ephesus and Miletus in Lesser Asia; were, by all accounts, at least equal to anyof the cities of antient Greece.1[40_XI__General_deductions_from_the.html#id_1047] All these colonies hadestablished themselves in countries inhabited by savage and barbarous nations,which easily gave place to the new settlers, who had of course plenty of goodland. It is calculated that the Israelites, though they increased very slowly,while they were wandering in the land of Canaan, on settling in a fertiledistrict of Egypt, doubled their numbers every fifteen years during the wholeperiod of their stay.2 [40_XI__General_deductions_from_the.html#id_1045] But notto dwell on remote instances, the European settlements in America, bear ampletestimony to the truth of a remark, that has never, I believe, been doubted.Plenty of rich land, to be had for little or nothing, is so powerful a cause ofpopulation, as generally to overcome all obstacles.No settlements could easily have been worse managed than those of Spain, inMexico, Peru, and Quito. The tyranny, superstition, and vices, of the mothercountry, were introduced in ample quantities among her children. Exorbitanttaxes were exacted by the crown; the most arbitrary restrictions were imposed ontheir trade; and the governors were not behind hand, in rapacity and extortionfor themselves as well as their master. Yet under all these difficulties, thecolonies made a quick progress in population. The city of Quito, which was but ahamlet of Indians, is represented by Ulloa as containing fifty or sixty thousandinhabitants above fifty years ago.3[40_XI__General_deductions_from_the.html#id_1053] Lima, which was founded sincethe conquest, is mentioned by the same author, as equally or more populous,before the fatal earthquake in 1746. Mexico is said to contain a hundredthousand inhabitants, which, notwithstanding the exaggerations of the Spanishwriters, is supposed to be five times greater than what it contained in the timeof Montezuma.4 [40_XI__General_deductions_from_the.html#id_1051]In the Portuguese colony of Brazil, governed with almost equal tyranny, therewere supposed to be, above thirty years ago, six hundred thousand inhabitants ofEuropean extraction.5 [40_XI__General_deductions_from_the.html#id_1049]The Dutch and French colonies, though under the government of exclusivecompanies of merchants, which, as Dr. Smith justly observes, is the worst of allpossible governments, still persisted in thriving under every disadvantage.6[40_XI__General_deductions_from_the.html#id_2183]But the English North American colonies, now the powerful people of the UnitedStates of America, far outstripped all the others, in the progress of theirpopulation. To the quantity of rich land, which they possessed in common withthe Spanish and Portuguese colonies, they added a greater degree of liberty andequality. Though not without some restrictions on their foreign commerce, theywere allowed the liberty of managing their own internal affairs. The politicalinstitutions which prevailed, were favourable to the alienation and division ofproperty. Lands, which were not cultivated by the proprietor within a limitedtime, were declared grantable to any other person. In Pensylvania, there was noright of primogeniture; and, in the provinces of New England, the eldest son hadonly a double share. There were no tythes in any of the States, and scarcely anytaxes. And an account of the extreme cheapness of good land, a capital could notbe more advantageously employed than in agriculture, which, at the same timethat it affords the greatest quantity of healthy work, supplies the mostvaluable produce to the society.The consequence of these favourable circumstances united, was, a rapidity ofincrease almost without parallel in history. Throughout all the northernprovinces the population was found to double itself in 25 years. The originalnumber of persons which had settled in the four provinces of New England in 1643was 21,200. Afterwards, it was calculated, that more left them than went tothem. In the year 1760, they were increased to half a million. They had,therefore, all along, doubled their number in 25 years. In New Jersey, theperiod of doubling appeared to be 22 years; and in Rhode Island still less. Inthe back settlements, where the inhabitants applied themselves solely toagriculture, and luxury was not known, they were supposed to double their numberin fifteen years. Along the sea-coast, which would naturally be first inhabited,the period of doubling was about 35 years, and in some of the maritime towns thepopulation was absolutely at a stand.7[40_XI__General_deductions_from_the.html#id_1057] From the late census made inAmerica, it appears, that, taking all the States together, they have stillcontinued to double their numbers every 25 years; and, as the whole populationis now so great, as not to be materially affected by the emigrations fromEurope; and as it is known, that in some of the towns, and districts near thesea-coast, the progress of population has been comparatively slow; it isevident, that in the interior of the country, in general, the period of doublingfrom procreation only, must have been considerably less than 25 years.The population of the United States of America, according to the late census, is5,172,312.8 [40_XI__General_deductions_from_the.html#id_1055] We have no reasonto believe that Great Britain is less populous, at present, for the emigrationof the small parent stock which produced these numbers. On the contrary, acertain degree of emigration is known to be favourable to the population of themother country. It has been particularly remarked that the two Spanish provincesfrom which the greatest number of people emigrated to America, became inconsequence more populous.Whatever was the original number of British emigrants which increased so fast inNorth America; let us ask, Why does not an equal number produce an equalincrease in the same time in Great Britain? The obvious reason to be assignedis, the want of food; and that this want is the most efficient cause of thethree great checks to population, which have been observed to prevail in allsocieties, is evident, from the rapidity with which even old states recover thedesolations of war, pestilence, famine, and the convulsions of nature. They arethen, for a short time, placed a little in the situation of new colonies, andthe effect is always answerable to what might be expected. If the industry ofthe inhabitants be not destroyed, subsistence will soon increase beyond thewants of the reduced numbers; and the invariable consequence will be, thatpopulation, which before, perhaps, was nearly stationary, will begin immediatelyto increase, and will continue its progress till the former population isrecovered.The fertile province of Flanders, which has been so often the seat of the mostdestructive wars, after a respite of a few years, has always appeared as richand as populous as ever. The undiminished population of France, which has beforebeen noticed, is an instance very strongly in point. The tables of Susmilchafford continual proofs of a very rapid increase, after great mortalities; andthe table for Prussia and Lithuania, which I have inserted,9[40_XI__General_deductions_from_the.html#id_1059] is particularly striking inthis respect. The effects of the dreadful plague in London, in 1666, were notperceptible 15 or 20 years afterwards. It may even be doubted, whether Turkeyand Egypt are, upon an average, much less populous for the plagues whichperiodically lay them waste. If the number of people which they contain beconsiderably less now, than formerly, it is rather to be attributed to thetyranny and oppression of the governments under which they groan, and theconsequent discouragements to agriculture, than to the losses which they sustainby the plague. The traces of the most destructive famines in China, Indostan,Egypt, and other countries, are by all accounts very soon obliterated; and themost tremendous convulsions of nature, such as volcanic eruptions andearthquakes, if they do not happen so frequently as to drive away theinhabitants, or destroy their spirit of industry, have been found to produce buta trifling effect on the average population of any state.It has appeared from the registers of different countries which have alreadybeen produced, that the progress of their population is checked by theperiodical, though irregular, returns of plagues and sickly seasons. Dr. Short,in his curious researches into bills of mortality, often uses the expression of“terrible correctives of the redundance of mankind;”10[40_XI__General_deductions_from_the.html#id_1065] and in a table of all theplagues, pestilences, and famines, of which he could collect accounts, shews theconstancy and universality of their operation.The epidemical years in his table, or the years in which the plague or somegreat and wasting epidemick prevailed, for smaller sickly seasons, seem not tobe included, are 431,11 [40_XI__General_deductions_from_the.html#id_1063] ofwhich 32 were before the Christian æra.12[40_XI__General_deductions_from_the.html#id_2185] If we divide, therefore, theyears of the present æra by 399, it will appear, that the periodical returns ofsuch epidemicks, to some country that we are acquainted with, have been on anaverage only at the interval of about 4-1/2 years.Of the 254 great famines and dearths, enumerated in the table, 15 were beforethe Christian æra,13 [40_XI__General_deductions_from_the.html#id_1061] beginningwith that which occurred in Palestine, in the time of Abraham. If, subtractingthese 15, we divide the years of the present æra by the remainder, it willappear that the average interval between the visits of this dreadful scourge hasbeen only about 7-1/2 years.How far these “terrible correctives to the redundance of mankind,” have beenoccasioned by the too rapid increase of population, is a point which it would bevery difficult to determine with any degree of precision. The causes of most ofour diseases appear to us to be so mysterious, und probably are really sovarious, that it would be rashness to lay too much stress on any single one: butit will not, perhaps, be too much to say, that, among these causes, we oughtcertainly to rank crowded houses, and insufficient or unwholesome food, whichare the natural consequences of an increase of population, faster, than theaccommodations of a country, with respect to habitations and food, will allow.Almost all the histories of epidemicks which we have, tend to confirm thissupposition, by describing them in general as making their principal ravagesamong the lower classes of people. In Dr. Short’s tables, this circumstance isfrequently mentioned;14 [40_XI__General_deductions_from_the.html#id_1071] and itfurther appears, that a very considerable proportion of the epidemick years,either followed, or were accompanied by seasons of dearth and bad food.15[40_XI__General_deductions_from_the.html#id_1069] In other places he alsomentions great plagues as diminishing particularly the numbers of the lower orservile sort of people;16 and, in speaking of different diseases, he observes,that those which are occasioned by bad and unwholesome food, generally last thelongest.17 [40_XI__General_deductions_from_the.html#id_2187]We know, from constant experience, that fevers are generated in our jails, ourmanufactories, our crowded workhouses, and in the narrow and close streets ofour large towns; all which situations appear to be similar in their effects tosqualid poverty: and we cannot doubt that causes of this kind, aggravated indegree, contributed to the production and prevalence of those great and wastingplagues formerly so common in Europe, but which now, from the mitigation ofthese causes, are every where considerably abated, and in many places appear tobe completely extirpated.Of the other great scourge of mankind, famine, it may be observed, that it isnot in the nature of things, that the increase of population should absolutelyproduce one. This increase, though rapid, is necessarily gradual; and as thehuman frame cannot be supported, even for a very short time, without food, it isevident, that no more human beings can grow up, than there is provision tomaintain. But though the principle of population cannot absolutely produce afamine, it prepares the way for one in the most complete manner; and, byobliging all the lower classes of people to subsist nearly on the smallestquantity of food that will support life, turns even a slight deficiency from thefailure of the seasons into a severe dearth; and may be fairly said, therefore,to be one of the principal causes of famine. Among the signs of an approachingdearth, Dr. Short mentions one or more years of luxuriant crops together;18[40_XI__General_deductions_from_the.html#id_1067] and this observation isprobably just, as we know that the general effect of years of cheapness andabundance is to dispose a greater number of persons to marry, and under suchcircumstances, the return to a year, merely of an average crop, might produce ascarcity.The small-pox, which at present may be considered as the most prevalent andfatal epidemick in Europe, is of all others, perhaps, the most difficult toaccount for, though the periods of its return are in many places regular.19[40_XI__General_deductions_from_the.html#id_2189] Dr. Short observes, that fromthe histories of this disorder, it seems to have very little dependence upon thepast or present constitution of the weather or seasons, and that it appearsepidemically at all times, and in all states of the air, though not sofrequently in a hard frost. We know of no instances, I believe, of its beingclearly generated under any circumstances of situation. I do not mean,therefore, to insinuate, that poverty and crowded houses ever absolutelyproduced it; but I may be allowed to remark, that in those places where itsreturns are regular, and its ravages among children, particularly among those ofthe lower class, are considerable, it necessarily follows, that thesecircumstances, in a greater degree than usual, must always precede and accompanyits appearance; that is, from the time of its last visit, the average number ofchildren will be increasing, the people will, in consequence, be growing poorer,and the houses will be more crowded, till another visit removes thissuperabundant population.In all these cases, how little soever force we may be disposed to attribute tothe effects of the principle of population in the actual production ofdisorders, we cannot avoid allowing their force as predisposing causes to thereception of contagion, and as giving very great additional force to theextensiveness and fatality of its ravages.It is observed by Dr. Short, that a severe mortal epidemick is generallysucceeded by an uncommon healthiness, from the late distemper having carried offmost of the declining worn-out constitutions.20[40_XI__General_deductions_from_the.html#id_1075] It is probable, also, thatanother cause of it, may be, the greater plenty of room and food, and theconsequently ameliorated condition of the lower classes of the people.Sometimes, according to Dr. Short, a very fruitful year is followed by a verymortal and sickly one, and mortal ones often succeeded by very fruitful, asthough Nature sought either to prevent or quickly repair the loss by death. Ingeneral the next year after sickly and mortal ones is prolifick in proportion tothe breeders left.21 [40_XI__General_deductions_from_the.html#id_1073]This last effect we have seen most strikingly exemplified in the table forPrussia and Lithuania.22 [40_XI__General_deductions_from_the.html#id_2191] Andfrom this and other tables of Susmilch, it also appears, that when theincreasing produce of a country and the increasing demand for labour, so farameliorate the condition of the labourer, as greatly to encourage marriage, thecustom of early marriages is generally continued, till the population has gonebeyond the increased produce, and sickly seasons appear to be the natural andnecessary consequence. The continental registers exhibit many instances of rapidincrease, interrupted in this manner by mortal diseases, and the inference seemsto be, that those countries where subsistence is increasing sufficiently toencourage population, but not to answer all its demands, will be more subject toperiodical epidemicks, than those where the increase of population is morenearly accommodated to the average produce.The converse of this will of course be true. In those countries which aresubject to periodical sicknesses, the increase of population, or the excess ofbirths above the deaths, will be greater, in the intervals of these periods,than is usual in countries not so much subject to these diseases. If Turkey andEgypt have been nearly stationary in their average population for the lastcentury, in the intervals of their periodical plagues, the births must haveexceeded the deaths in a much greater proportion than in such countries asFrance and England.It is for these reasons, that no estimates of future population or depopulation,formed from any existing rate of increase or decrease, can be depended upon. SirWilliam Petty calculated that, in the year 1800, the city of London wouldcontain 5,359,00023 [40_XI__General_deductions_from_the.html#id_1081]inhabitants, instead of which, it does not now contain a fifth part of thatnumber. And Mr. Eton has lately prophesied the extinction of the population ofthe Turkish empire in another century;24[40_XI__General_deductions_from_the.html#id_1079] an event which will, ascertainly, fail of taking place. If America were to continue increasing at thesame rate as at present, for the next 150 years, her population would exceed thepopulation of China; but though prophecies are dangerous, I will venture to say,that such an increase will not take place in that time, though it may perhaps infive or six hundred years.Europe was, without doubt, formerly more subject to plagues and wastingepidemicks than at present, and this will account, in great measure, for thegreater proportion of births to deaths in former times, mentioned by manyauthors, as it has always been a common practice, to estimate these proportionsfrom too short periods, and generally to reject the years of plague asaccidental.The highest average proportion of births to deaths in England may be consideredas about 12 to 10, or 120 to 100. The proportion in France for ten years, endingin 1780, was about 115 to 100.25[40_XI__General_deductions_from_the.html#id_1077] Though these proportions haveundoubtedly varied, at different periods, during the last century, yet we havereason to think that they have not varied in any very considerable degree; andit will appear, therefore, that the population of France and England hasaccommodated itself more nearly to the average produce of each country than manyother states. The operation of the preventive check, vicious manners, wars, thesilent, though certain, destruction of life in large towns and manufactories,and the close habitations and insufficient food of many of the poor, preventpopulation from outrunning the means of subsistence; and if I may use anexpression, which certainly at first appears strange, supersede the necessity ofgreat and ravaging epidemicks to destroy what is redundant. If a wasting plaguewere to sweep off two millions in England, and six millions in France, it cannotbe doubted, that after the inhabitants had recovered from the dreadful shock,the proportion of births to deaths would rise much above the usual average ineither country during the last century.26[40_XI__General_deductions_from_the.html#id_1083]In New Jersey the proportion of births to deaths, on an average of 7 years,ending 1743, was 300 to 100. In France and England, the highest averageproportion cannot be reckoned at more than 120 to 100. Great and astonishing asthis difference is, we ought not to be so wonder-struck at it, as to attributeit to the miraculous interposition of heaven. The causes of it are not remote,latent, and mysterious, but near us, round about us, and open to theinvestigation of every inquiring mind. It accords with the most liberal spiritof philosophy to believe, that not a stone can fall, or plant rise, without theimmediate agency of divine power. But we know, from experience, that theseoperations of what we call nature, have been conducted almost invariablyaccording to fixed laws. And since the world began, the causes of population anddepopulation have been probably as constant as any of the laws of nature withwhich we are acquainted.The passion between the sexes has appeared in every age to be so nearly thesame, that it may always be considered, in algebraic language, as a givenquantity. The great law of necessity, which prevents population from increasingin any country beyond the food which it can either produce or acquire, is a law,so open to our view, so obvious and evident to our understandings, that wecannot for a moment doubt it. The different modes which nature takes to repressa redundant population, do not appear indeed to us so certain and regular; butthough we cannot always predict the mode, we may with certainty predict thefact. If the proportion of the births to the deaths for a few years, indicate anincrease of numbers much beyond the proportional increased or acquired food ofthe country, we may be perfectly certain, that unless an emigration take place,the deaths will shortly exceed the births, and that the increase that had beenobserved for a few years, cannot be the real average increase of the populationof the country. If there were no other depopulating causes, and if thepreventive check did not operate very strongly, every country would, withoutdoubt, be subject to periodical plagues or famines.The only true criterion of a real and permanent increase in the population ofany country, is the increase of the means of subsistence. But even thiscriterion is subject to some slight variations, which however are completelyopen to our observation. In some countries population seems to have been forced;that is, the people have been habituated, by degrees, to live almost upon thesmallest possible quantity of food. There must have been periods in suchcountries when population increased permanently without an increase in the meansof subsistence. China, India, and the countries possessed by the Bedoween Arabs,as we have seen in the former part of this work, appear to answer to thisdescription. The average produce of these countries seems to be but barelysufficient to support the lives of the inhabitants, and of course any deficiencyfrom the badness of the seasons must be fatal. Nations in this state mustnecessarily be subject to famines.In America, where the reward of labour is at present so liberal, the lowerclasses might retrench very considerably in a year of scarcity, withoutmaterially distressing themselves. A famine, therefore, seems to be almostimpossible. It may be expected, that in the progress of the population ofAmerica, the labourers will in time be much less liberally rewarded. The numberswill in this case permanently increase without a proportional increase in themeans of subsistence.In the different countries of Europe, there must be some variations in theproportion of the number of inhabitants, and the quantity of food consumed,arising from the different habits of living which prevail in each state. Thelabourers of the South of England are so accustomed to eat fine wheaten bread,that they will suffer themselves to be half-starved, before they will submit tolive like the Scotch peasants. They might, perhaps, in time, by the constantoperation of the hard law of necessity, be reduced to live, even like the lowerclasses of the Chinese, and the country would then, with the same quantity offood, support a greater population. But to effect this, must always be adifficult, and every friend to humanity will hope, an abortive attempt.I have mentioned some cases where population may permanently increase, without aproportional increase in the means of subsistence. But it is evident, that thevariation in different states, between the food, and the numbers supported byit, is restricted to a limit beyond which it cannot pass. In every country, thepopulation of which is not absolutely decreasing, the food must be necessarilysufficient to support and to continue the race of labourers.Other circumstances being the same, it may be affirmed, that countries arepopulous according to the quantity of human food which they produce, or canacquire; and happy, according to the liberality with which this food is divided,or the quantity which a day’s labour will purchase. Corn countries are morepopulous than pasture countries; and rice countries more populous than corncountries. But their happiness does not depend either upon their being thinly orfully inhabited, upon their poverty or their riches, their youth or their age;but on the proportion which the population and the food bear to each other. Thisproportion is generally the most favourable in new colonies, where the knowledgeand industry of an old state, operate on the fertile unappropriated land of anew one. In other cases the youth, or the age, of a state is not, in thisrespect, of great importance. It is probable that the food of Great Britain isdivided in more liberal shares to her inhabitants at the present period, than itwas, two thousand, three thousand, or four thousand years ago. And it hasappeared that the poor and thinly-inhabited tracts of the Scotch Highlands aremore distressed by a redundant population, than the most populous parts ofEurope.If a country were never to be over-run by a people more advanced in arts, butleft to its own natural progress in civilization; from the time that its producemight be considered as an unit, to the time that it might be considered as amillion, during the lapse of many thousand years, there would not be a singleperiod, when the mass of the people could be said to be free from distress,either directly or indirectly, for want of food. In every state in Europe, sincewe have first had accounts of it, millions and millions of human existences havebeen repressed from this simple cause, though perhaps, in some of these states,an absolute famine may never have been known.Famine seems to be the last, the most dreadful resource of nature. The power ofpopulation is so superior to the power in the earth to produce subsistence forman, that, unless arrested by the preventive check, premature death must in someshape or other visit the human race. The vices of mankind are active and ableministers of depopulation. They are the precursors in the great army ofdestruction, and often finish the dreadful work themselves. But should they failin this war of extermination, sickly seasons, epidemicks, pestilence, andplague, advance in terrifick array, and sweep off their thousands and tenthousands. Should success be still incomplete, gigantick inevitable faminestalks in the rear, and, with one mighty blow, levels the population with thefood of the world.Must it not then be acknowledged, by an attentive examiner of the histories ofmankind, that, in every age, and in every state, in which man has existed, ordoes now exist,The increase of population is necessarily limited by the means of subsistence.Population invariably increases when the means of subsistence increase, unlessprevented by powerful and obvious checks.These checks, and the checks which keep the population down to the level of themeans of subsistence, are, moral restraint, vice, and misery.In comparing the state of society which has been considered in this second bookwith that which formed the subject of the first, I think it appears, that inmodern Europe the positive checks to population prevail less, and the preventivechecks more, than in past times, and in the more uncivilized parts of the world.War, the predominant check to the population of savage nations, has certainlyabated, even including the late unhappy revolutionary contests: and since theprevalence of a greater degree of personal cleanliness, of better modes ofclearing and building towns, and of a more equable distribution of the productsof the soil from improving knowledge in political economy, plagues, violentdiseases, and famines, have been certainly mitigated, and have become lessfrequent.With regard to the preventive checks to population, though it must beacknowledged, that moral restraint does not at present prevail much among themale part of society; yet I am strongly disposed to believe that it prevailsmore than in those states which were first considered; and it can scarcely bedoubted, that in modern Europe, a much larger proportion of women pass aconsiderable part of their lives in the exercise of this virtue, than in pasttimes and among uncivilized nations. But however this may be, taking thepreventive check in its general acceptation, as implying an infrequency of themarriage union from the fear of a family, without reference to its producingvice, it may be considered, in this light, as the most powerful of the checks,which in modern Europe keep down the population to the level of the means ofsubsistence.NOTES1 [40_XI__General_deductions_from_the.html#id_1046].

I have lately had an opportunityof seeing some extracts from the sermon of Dr. Styles, from which Dr. Price hastaken these facts. Speaking of Rhode Island, Dr. Styles says, that though theperiod of doubling for the whole colony is 25 years, yet that it is different indifferent parts, and within land is 20 and 15 years. The five towns ofGloucester, Situate, Coventry, Westgreenwich, and Exeter, were 5033, A. D. 1748,and 6986 A. D. 1755; which implies a period of doubling of 15 years only. Hementions afterwards that the county of Kent doubles in 20 years; and the countyof Providence in 18 years.I have also lately seen a paper of Facts and calculations respecting thepopulation of the United States, which makes the period of doubling for thewhole of the States, since their first settlement, only 20 years. I know not ofwhat authority this paper is; but, far as it goes upon publick facts andenumerations, I should think, that it must be to be depended on. One period isvery striking. From a return to Congress in 1782, the population appeared to be2,389,300, and in the census of 1790, 4,000,000: increase in 9 years, 1,610,700:from which deduct ten thousand per annum for European settlers, which will be90,000; and allow for their increase at 5 per cent. for 4-12 years, which willbe 20,250: the remaining increase during these 9 years, from procreation only,will be 1,500,450, which is very nearly 7 per cent.; and consequently the periodof doubling at this rate would be less than 16 years.If this calculation for the whole population of the States be in any degree nearthe truth, it cannot be doubted, that, in particular districts, the period ofdoubling from procreation only, has often been less than 15 years. The periodimmediately succeeding the war was likely to be a period of very rapid increase.8 [40_XI__General_deductions_from_the.html#id_1054]. One small State ismentioned as being omitted in the census; and I understand that the populationis generally considered at above this number. It is said to approach towards6,000,000. But such vague opinions cannot of course be much relied on.9 [40_XI__General_deductions_from_the.html#id_1058]. See p. 203.10 [40_XI__General_deductions_from_the.html#id_1064].

I.Of Systems of Equality. Wallace. Condorcet.TO a person who views the past and present states of mankind in the light inwhich they have appeared in the two preceding books, it cannot but be a matterof astonishment, that all the writers on the perfectibility of man and ofsociety, who have noticed the argument of the principle of population, treat italways very slightly, and invariably represent the difficulties arising from it,as at a great, and almost immeasurable distance. Even Mr. Wallace, who thoughtthe argument itself of so much weight, as to destroy his whole system ofequality, did not seem to be aware that any difficulty would arise from thiscause, till the whole earth had been cultivated like a garden, and was incapableof any further increase of produce. Were this really the case, and were abeautiful system of equality in other respects practicable, I cannot think thatour ardour in the pursuit of such a scheme ought to be damped by thecontemplation of so remote a difficulty. An event at such a distance mightfairly be left to providence. But the truth is, that if the view of the argumentgiven in this essay be just, the difficulty, so far from being remote, would beimminent and immediate. At every period during the progress of cultivation, fromthe present moment to the time when the whole earth was become like a garden,the distress for want of food would be constantly pressing on all mankind, ifthey were equal. Though the produce of the earth would be increasing every year,population would be increasing much faster, and the redundancy must necessarilybe checked by the periodical, or constant action, of moral restraint, vice, ormisery.M. Condorcet’s Esquisse d’un tableau historique des progrès de l’esprit humain,was written, it is said, under the pressure of that cruel proscription whichterminated in his death. If he had no hopes of its being seen during his life,and of its interesting France in his favour, it is a singular instance of theattachment of a man to principles, which every day’s experience was, so fatallyfor himself, contradicting. To see the human mind, in one of the mostenlightened nations of the world, debased by such a fermentation of disgustingpassions, of fear, cruelty, malice, revenge, ambition, madness, and folly, aswould have disgraced the most savage nations in the most barbarous age, musthave been such a tremendous shock to his ideas of the necessary and inevitableprogress of the human mind, that nothing but the firmest conviction of the truthof his principles, in spite of all appearances, could have withstood.This posthumous publication is only a sketch of a much larger work which heproposed should be executed. It necessarily wants, therefore, that detail andapplication, which can alone prove the truth of any theory. A few observationswill be sufficient to shew how completely this theory is contradicted, when itis applied to the real and not to an imaginary state of things.In the last division of the work, which treats of the future progress of mantowards perfection, M. Condorcet says, that, comparing in the differentcivilized nations of Europe, the actual population with the extent of territory;and observing their cultivation, their industry, their divisions of labour, andtheir means of subsistence, we shall see, that it would be impossible topreserve the same means of subsistence, and consequently the same population,without a number of individuals who have no other means of supplying their wantsthan their industry.Having allowed the necessity of such a class of men, and adverting afterwards tothe precarious revenue of those families that would depend so entirely on thelife and health of their chief,1[42_CHAP__I__Of_systems_of_equality.html#id_1085] he says very justly, “Thereexists then a necessary cause of inequality, of dependence, and even of misery,which menaces, without ceasing, the most numerous and active class of oursocieties.” The difficulty is just, and well stated; but his mode of removingit, will, I fear, be found totally inefficacious.By the application of calculations to the probabilities of life, and theinterest of money, he proposes that a fund should be established, which shouldassure to the old an assistance, produced in part by their own former savings,and in part by the savings of individuals, who, in making the same sacrifice,die before they reap the benefit of it. The same, or a similar fund, should giveassistance to women and children, who lose their husbands or fathers; and afforda capital to those who were of an age to found a new family, sufficient for thedevelopment of their industry. These establishments, he observes, might be madein the name, and under the protection, of the society. Going still further, hesays, that by the just application of calculations, means might be found of morecompletely preserving a state of equality, by preventing credit from being theexclusive privilege of great fortunes, and yet giving it a basis equally solid,and by rendering the progress of industry and the activity of commerce, lessdependent on great capitalists.Such establishments and calculations may appear very promising upon paper; butwhen applied to real life, they will be found to be absolutely nugatory. M.Condorcet allows, that a class of people which maintains itself entirely byindustry is necessary to every state. Why does he allow this? No other reasoncan well be assigned, than because he conceives, that the labour necessary toprocure subsistence for an extended population, will not be performed withoutthe goad of necessity. If by establishments, upon the plans that have beenmentioned, this spur to industry be removed; if the idle and negligent be placedupon the same footing with regard to their credit, and the future support oftheir wives and families, as the active and industrious, can we expect to seemen exert that animated activity in bettering their condition, which now formsthe master-spring of publick prosperity. If an inquisition were to beestablished to examine the claims of each individual, and to determine whetherhe had, or had not, exerted himself to the utmost, and to grant or refuseassistance accordingly, this would be little else than a repetition upon alarger scale, of the English poor laws, and would be completely destructive ofthe true principles of liberty and equality.But independently of this great objection to these establishments, andsupposing, for a moment, that they would give no check to production, thegreatest difficulty remains yet behind.Were every man sure of a comfortable provision for a family, almost every manwould have one; and were the rising generation free from the “killing frost” ofmisery, population must increase with unusual rapidity. Of this, M. Condorcetseems to be fully aware himself; and, after having described furtherimprovements, he says,“But in this progress of industry and happiness, each generation will be calledto more extended enjoyments, and, in consequence, by the physical constitutionof the human frame, to an increase in the number of individuals. Must not therearrive a period then, when these laws, equally necessary, shall counteract eachother? when the increase of the number of men surpassing their means ofsubsistence, the necessary result must be, either a continual diminution ofhappiness, and population – a movement truly retrograde; or, at least, a kind ofoscillation between good and evil? In societies arrived at this term, will notthis oscillation be a constantly subsisting cause of periodical misery? Will itnot mark the limit when all further amelioration will become impossible, andpoint out that term to the perfectibility of the human race, which it may reachin the course of ages, but can never pass?” He then adds,“There is no person who does not see how very distant such a period is from us.But shall we ever arrive at it? It is equally impossible to pronounce for, oragainst, the future realization of an event, which cannot take place but at anæra, when the human race will have attained improvements of which we can, atpresent, scarcely form a conception.”M. Condorcet’s picture of what may be expected to happen, when the number of menshall surpass their means of subsistence, is justly drawn. The oscillation whichhe describes will certainly take place, and will, without doubt, be a constantlysubsisting cause of periodical misery. The only point in which I differ from M.Condorcet in this description, is, with regard to the period when it may beapplied to the human race. M. Condorcet thinks that it cannot possibly beapplicable, but at an æra extremely distant. If the proportion between thenatural increase of population and food, which was stated in the beginning ofthis essay, and which has received considerable confirmation from the povertythat has been found to prevail in every stage and department of human society,be in any degree near the truth, it will appear, on the contrary, that theperiod when the number of men surpass their means of subsistence, has long sincearrived; and that this necessary oscillation, this constantly subsisting causeof periodical misery, has existed ever since we have had any histories ofmankind, does exist at present, and will for ever continue to exist, unless somedecided change take place in the physical constitution of our nature.M. Condorcet, however, goes on to say, that should the period which he conceivesto be so distant ever arrive, the human race, and the advocates of theperfectibility of man, need not be alarmed at it. He then proceeds to remove thedifficulty in a manner which I profess not to understand. Having observed, thatthe ridiculous prejudices of superstition would by that time have ceased tothrow over morals a corrupt and degrading austerity, he alludes either to apromiscuous concubinage, which would prevent breeding, or to something else asunnatural. To remove the difficulty in this way, will surely, in the opinion ofmost men, be, to destroy that virtue and purity of manners, which the advocatesof equality, and of the perfectibility of man, profess to be the end and objectof their views.The last question which M. Condorcet proposes for examination, is, the organicperfectibility of man. He observes, that if the proofs which have been alreadygiven, and which, in their development, will receive greater force in the workitself, are sufficient to establish the indefinite perfectibility of man, uponthe supposition, of the same natural faculties, and the same organization whichhe has at present; what will be the certainty, what the extent of our hopes, ifthis organization, these natural faculties themselves, be susceptible ofamelioration?From the improvement of medicine; from the use of more wholesome food, andhabitations; from a manner of living, which will improve the strength of thebody by exercise, without impairing it by excess; from the destruction of thetwo great causes of the degration of man, misery, and too great riches; from thegradual removal of transmissible and contagious disorders, by the improvement ofphysical knowledge, rendered more efficacious, by the progress of reason and ofsocial order; he infers, that though man will not absolutely become immortal,yet that the duration between his birth, and natural death, will increasewithout ceasing, will have no assignable term, and may properly be expressed bythe word indefinite. He then defines this word to mean, either a constantapproach to an unlimited extent, without ever reaching it; or, an increase inthe immensity of ages to an extent greater than any assignable quantity.But surely the application of this term in either of these senses, to theduration of human life, is in the highest degree unphilosophical, and totallyunwarranted by any appearances in the laws of nature. Variations from differentcauses are essentially distinct from a regular and unretrograde increase. Theaverage duration of human life will, to a certain degree, vary, from healthy orunhealthy climates, from wholesome or unwholesome food, from virtuous or viciousmanners, and other causes; but it may be fairly doubted, whether there has beenreally the smallest perceptible advance in the natural duration of human life,since first we had any authentic history of man. The prejudices of all ageshave, indeed, been directly contrary to this supposition; and though I would notlay much stress upon these prejudices, they will in some measure tend to prove,that there has been no marked advance in an opposite direction.It may perhaps be said, that the world is yet so young, so completely in itsinfancy, that it ought not to be expected that any difference should appear sosoon.If this be the case, there is at once an end of all human science. The wholetrain of reasonings from effects to causes will be destroyed. We may shut oureyes to the book of nature, as it will no longer be of any use to read it. Thewildest and most improbable conjectures may be advanced with as much certaintyas the most just and sublime theories, founded on careful and reiteratedexperiments. We may return again to the old mode of philosophising, and makefacts bend to systems, instead of establishing systems upon facts. The grand andconsistent theory of Newton, will be placed upon the same footing as the wildand eccentric hypotheses of Descartes. In short, if the laws of nature be thusfickle and inconstant; if it can be affirmed, and be believed, that they willchange, when for ages and ages they have appeared immutable, the human mind willno longer have any incitements to inquiry, but must remain fixed in inactivetorpor, or amuse itself only in bewildering dreams, and extravagant fancies.The constancy of the laws of nature, and of effects and causes, is thefoundation of all human knowledge; and, if without any previous observablesymptoms or indications of a change, we can infer that a change will take place,we may as well make any assertion whatever, and think it as unreasonable to becontradicted, in affirming that the moon will come in contact with the earthto-morrow, as in saying, that the sun will rise at its appointed time.With regard to the duration of human life, there does not appear to haveexisted, from the earliest ages of the world, to the present moment, thesmallest permanent symptom, or indication, of increasing prolongation. Theobservable effects of climate, habit, diet, and other causes, on length of life,have furnished the pretext for asserting its indefinite extension; and the sandyfoundation on which the argument rests, is, that because the limit of human lifeis undefined; because you cannot mark its precise term, and say so far exactlyshall it go, and no further; that therefore its extent may increase for ever,and be properly termed, indefinite or unlimited. But the fallacy and absurdityof this argument will sufficiently appear from a slight examination of what M.Condorcet calls the organic perfectibility, or degeneration, of the race ofplants and animals, which, he says, may be regarded as one of the general lawsof nature.I am told, that it is a maxim among the improvers of cattle, that you may breedto any degree of nicety you please; and they found this maxim upon another,which is, that some of the offspring will possess the desirable qualities of theparents in a greater degree. In the famous Leicestershire breed of sheep, theobject is to procure them with small heads and small legs. Proceeding upon thesebreeding maxims, it is evident, that we might go on till the heads and legs wereevanescent quantities; but this is so palpable an absurdity, that we may bequite sure that the premises are not just, and that there really is a limit,though we cannot see it, or say exactly where it is. In this case, the point ofthe greatest degree of improvement, or the smallest size of the head and legs,may be said to be undefined; but this is very different from unlimited, or fromindefinite, in M. Condorcet’s acceptation of the term. Though I may not be able,in the present instance, to mark the limit, at which further improvement willstop, I can very easily mention a point at which it will not arrive. I shouldnot scruple to assert, that were the breeding to continue for ever, the headsand legs of these sheep would never be so small as the head and legs of a rat.It cannot be true, therefore, that among animals, some of the offspring willpossess the desirable qualities of the parents in a greater degree; or thatanimals are indefinitely perfectible.The progress of a wild plant, to a beautiful garden flower, is perhaps moremarked and striking, than any thing that takes place among animals; yet evenhere, it would be the height of absurdity to assert, that the progress wasunlimited or indefinite. One of the most obvious features of the improvement isthe increase of size. The flower has grown gradually larger by cultivation. Ifthe progress were really unlimited, it might be increased ad infinitum; but thisis so gross an absurdity, that we may be quite sure, that among plants, as wellas among animals, there is a limit to improvement, though we do not exactly knowwhere it is. It is probable that the gardeners who contend for flower prizeshave often applied stronger dressing without success. At the same time, it wouldbe highly presumptuous in any man to say, that he had seen the finest carnationor anemone that could ever be made to grow. He might however assert without thesmallest chance of being contradicted by a future fact, that no carnation oranemone could ever by cultivation be increased to the size of a large cabbage;and yet there are assignable quantities greater than a cabbage. No man can saythat he has seen the largest ear of wheat, or the largest oak that could evergrow; but he might easily, and with perfect certainty, name a point ofmagnitude, at which they would not arrive. In all these cases, therefore, acareful distinction should be made, between an unlimited progress, and aprogress where the limit is merely undefined.It will be said, perhaps, that the reason why plants and animals cannot increaseindefinitely in size, is, that they would fall by their own weight. I answer,how do we know this but from experience? from experience of the degree ofstrength with which these bodies are formed. I know that a carnation, longbefore it reached the size of a cabbage, would not be supported by its stalk;but I only know this from my experience of the weakness, and want of tenacity inthe materials of a carnation stalk. There are many substances in nature, of thesame size, that would support as large a head as a cabbage.The reasons of the mortality of plants are at present perfectly unknown to us.No man can say why such a plant is annual, another biennial, and another enduresfor ages. The whole affair in all these cases, in plants, animals, and in thehuman race, is an affair of experience; and I only conclude that man is mortal,because the invariable experience of all ages has proved the mortality of thosematerials of which his visible body is made.“What can we reason but from what we know.”Sound philosophy will not authorize me to alter this opinion of the mortality ofman on earth, till it can be clearly proved, that the human race has made, andis making, a decided progress towards an illimitable extent of life. And thechief reason why I adduced the two particular instances from animals and plants,was, to expose, and illustrate, if I could, the fallacy of that argument, whichinfers an unlimited progress, merely because some partial improvement has takenplace, and that the limit of this improvement cannot be precisely ascertained.The capacity of improvement in plants and animals, to a certain degree, noperson can possibly doubt. A clear and decided progress has already been made;and yet, I think it appears, that it would be highly absurd to say, that thisprogress has no limits. In human life, though there are great variations fromdifferent causes, it may be doubted, whether, since the world began, any organicimprovement whatever of the human frame can be clearly ascertained. Thefoundations, therefore, on which the arguments for the organic perfectibility ofman rest, are unusually weak, and can only be considered as mere conjectures. Itdoes not, however, by any means, seem impossible, that by an attention to breed,a certain degree of improvement, similar to that among animals, might take placeamong men. Whether intellect could be communicated may be a matter of doubt: butsize, strength, beauty, complexion, and perhaps even longevity, are in a degreetransmissible. The error does not seem to lie, in supposing a small degree ofimprovement possible, but in not discriminating between a small improvement, thelimit of which is undefined, and an improvement really unlimited. As the humanrace, however, could not be improved in this way, without condemning all the badspecimens to celibacy, it is not probable, that an attention to breed shouldever become general; indeed, I know of no well-directed attempts of the kind,except in the ancient family of the Bickerstaffs, who are said to have been verysuccessful in whitening the skins, and increasing the height of their race byprudent marriages, particularly by that very judicious cross with Maud themilk-maid, by which some capital defects in the constitutions of the family werecorrected.It will not be necessary, I think, in order more completely to shew theimprobability of any approach in man towards immortality on earth, to urge thevery great additional weight that an increase in the duration of life would giveto the argument of population.M. Condorcet’s book may be considered, not only as a sketch of the opinions of acelebrated individual, but of many of the literary men in France, at thebeginning of the revolution. As such, though merely a sketch, it seems worthy ofattention.Many, I doubt not, will think that the attempting gravely to controvert soabsurd a paradox, as the immortality of man on earth, or indeed, even theperfectibility of man and society, is a waste of time and words; and that suchunfounded conjectures are best answered by neglect. I profess, however, to be ofa different opinion. When paradoxes of this kind are advanced by ingenious andable men, neglect has no tendency to convince them of their mistakes. Pridingthemselves on what they conceive to be a mark of the reach and size of their ownunderstandings, of the extent and comprehensiveness of their views; they willlook upon this neglect merely as an indication of poverty, and narrowness, inthe mental exertions of their contemporaries; and only think, that the world isnot yet prepared to receive their sublime truths.On the contrary, a candid investigation of these subjects, accompanied with aperfect readiness to adopt any theory, warranted by sound philosophy, may have atendency to convince them, that, in forming improbable and unfounded hypotheses,so far from enlarging the bounds of human science, they are contracting it; sofar from promoting the improvement of the human mind, they are obstructing it:they are throwing us back again almost into the infancy of knowledge; andweakening the foundations of that mode of philosophising, under the auspices ofwhich, science has of late made such rapid advances. The late rage for wide andunrestrained speculation, seems to have been a kind of mental intoxication,arising, perhaps, from the great and unexpected discoveries which had been madein various branches of science. To men, elate and giddy with such successes,every thing appeared to be within the grasp of human powers; and, under thisillusion, they confounded subjects where no real progress could be proved, withthose, where the progress had been marked, certain, and acknowledged. Could theybe persuaded to sober themselves with a little severe and chastized thinking,they would see, that the cause of truth, and of sound philosophy, cannot butsuffer, by substituting wild flights and unsupported assertions, for patientinvestigation, and well authenticated proofs.NOTE1 [42_CHAP__I__Of_systems_of_equality.html#id_1084].

II.Of Systems of Equality. Godwin.IN reading Mr. Godwin’s ingenious work on political justice, it is impossiblenot to be struck with the spirit and energy of his style, the force andprecision of some of his reasonings, the ardent tone of his thoughts, andparticularly with that impressive earnestness of manner, which gives an air oftruth to the whole. At the same time it must be confessed, that he has notproceeded in his inquiries with the caution that sound philosophy requires. Hisconclusions are often unwarranted by his premises. He fails sometimes inremoving objections which he himself brings forward. He relies too much ongeneral and abstract propositions which will not admit of application. And hisconjectures certainly far outstrip the modesty of nature.The system of equality which Mr. Godwin proposes, is, on a first view, the mostbeautiful and engaging of any that has yet appeared. An amelioration of societyto be produced merely by reason and conviction, gives more promise ofpermanence, than any change effected, and maintained by force. The unlimitedexercise of private judgement, is a doctrine grand and captivating, and has avast superiority over those systems, where every individual is in a manner theslave of the publick. The substitution of benevolence, as the masterspring andmoving principle of society, instead of self-love, appears, at first sight, tobe a consummation devoutly to be wished. In short, it is impossible tocontemplate the whole of this fair picture without emotions of delight andadmiration, accompanied with an ardent longing for the period of itsaccomplishment. But alas! that moment can never arrive. The whole is littlebetter than a dream – a phantom of the imagination. These “gorgeous palaces” ofhappiness and immortality, these “solemn temples” of truth and virtue, willdissolve, “like the baseless fabric of a vision,” when we awaken to real life,and contemplate the genuine situation of man on earth.Mr. Godwin, at the conclusion of the third chapter of his eighth book, speakingof population, says, “There is a principle in human society, by which populationis perpetually kept down to the level of the means of subsistence. Thus, amongthe wandering tribes of America and Asia, we never find, through the lapse ofages, that population has so increased as to render necessary the cultivation ofthe earth.”1 [43_II__Of_systems_of_equality__Godw.html#id_1087] This principle,which Mr. Godwin thus mentions as some mysterious and occult cause, and which hedoes not attempt to investigate, has appeared to be the grinding law ofnecessity – misery, and the fear of misery.The great error under which Mr. Godwin labours, throughout his whole work, is,the attributing of almost all the vices and misery that prevail in civil societyto human institutions. Political regulations, and the established administrationof property, are, with him, the fruitful sources of all evil, the hotbeds of allthe crimes that degrade mankind. Were this really a true state of the case, itwould not seem an absolutely hopeless task, to remove evil completely from theworld; and reason seems to be the proper and adequate instrument, for effectingso great a purpose. But the truth is, that, though human institutions appear tobe the obvious and obtrusive causes of much mischief to mankind, they are, inreality, light and superficial, in comparison with those deeper-seated causes ofevil which result from the laws of nature.In a chapter on the benefits attendant upon a system of equality, Mr. Godwinsays, “The spirit of oppression, the spirit of servility, and the spirit offraud, these are the immediate growth of the established administration ofproperty. They are alike hostile to intellectual improvement. The other vices ofenvy, malice, and revenge, are their inseparable companions. In a state ofsociety where men lived in the midst of plenty, and where all shared alike thebounties of nature, these sentiments would inevitably expire. The narrowprinciple of selfishness would vanish. No man being obliged to guard his littlestore, or provide with anxiety and pain for his restless wants, each would losehis individual existence in the thought of the general good. No man would be anenemy to his neighbours, for they would have no subject of contention; and ofconsequence philanthropy would resume the empire which reason assigns her. Mindwould be delivered from her perpetual anxiety about corporal support, and freeto expatiate in the field of thought which is congenial to her. Each wouldassist the inquiries of all.”2[43_II__Of_systems_of_equality__Godw.html#id_2193]This would indeed be a happy state. But that it is merely an imaginary picture,with scarcely a feature near the truth, the reader, I am afraid, is already toowell convinced.Man cannot live in the midst of plenty. All cannot share alike the bounties ofnature. Were there no established administration of property, every man would beobliged to guard with force his little store. Selfishness would be triumphant.The subjects of contention would be perpetual. Every individual would be under aconstant anxiety about corporal support, and not a single intellect would beleft free to expatiate in the field of thought.How little Mr. Godwin has turned his attention to the real state of humansociety, will sufficiently appear from the manner in which he endeavours toremove the difficulty of an overcharged population. He says, “The obvious answerto this objection is, that to reason thus, is to foresee difficulties at a greatdistance. Three-fourths of the habitable globe is now uncultivated. The partsalready cultivated are capable of immeasurable improvement. Myriads of centuriesof still increasing population may pass away, and the earth be still foundsufficient for the subsistence of its inhabitants.”3[43_II__Of_systems_of_equality__Godw.html#id_1089]I have already pointed out the error of supposing that no distress or difficultywould arise from a redundant population, before the earth absolutely refused toproduce any more. But let us imagine, for a moment, Mr. Godwin’s system ofequality realized in its utmost extent, and see how soon this difficulty mightbe expected to press, under so perfect a form of society. A theory that will notadmit of application cannot possibly be just.Let us suppose all the causes of vice and misery in this island removed. War andcontention cease. Unwholesome trades and manufactories do not exist. Crowds nolonger collect together in great and pestilent cities, for purposes of courtintrigue, of commerce, and vicious gratification. Simple, healthy, and rationalamusements, take place of drinking, gaming, and debauchery. There are no townssufficiently large, to have any prejudicial effects on the human constitution.The greater part of the happy inhabitants of this terrestrial paradise live inhamlets and farm houses, scattered over the face of the country. All men areequal. The labours of luxury are at an end; and the necessary labours ofagriculture are shared amicably among all. The number of persons and the produceof the island we suppose to be the same as at present. The spirit of benevolenceguided by impartial justice, will divide this produce among all the members ofsociety according to their wants. Though it would be impossible that they shouldall have animal food every day, yet vegetable food, with meat occasionally,would satisfy the desires of a frugal people, and would be sufficient topreserve them in health, strength, and spirits.Mr. Godwin considers marriage as a fraud, and a monopoly.4[43_II__Of_systems_of_equality__Godw.html#id_2195] Let us suppose the commerceof the sexes established upon principles of the most perfect freedom. Mr. Godwindoes not think himself, that this freedom would lead to a promiscuousintercourse; and in this, I perfectly agree with him. The love of variety is avicious, corrupt, and unnatural taste, and could not prevail, in any greatdegree, in a simple and virtuous state of society. Each man would probablyselect for himself a partner, to whom he would adhere, as long as that adherencecontinued to be the choice of both parties. It would be of little consequence,according to Mr. Godwin, how many children a woman had, or to whom theybelonged. Provisions and assistance would spontaneously flow from the quarter inwhich they abounded, to the quarter in which they were deficient.5[43_II__Of_systems_of_equality__Godw.html#id_1091] And every man, according tohis capacity, would be ready to furnish instruction to the rising generation.I cannot conceive a form of society so favourable, upon the whole, topopulation. The irremediableness of marriage, as it is at present constituted,undoubtedly deters many from entering into this state. An unshackledintercourse, on the contrary, would be a most powerful incitement to earlyattachments: and as we are supposing no anxiety about the future support ofchildren to exist, I do not conceive that there would be one woman in a hundred,of twenty-three years of age, without a family.With these extraordinary encouragements to population, and every cause ofdepopulation, as we have supposed, removed, the numbers would necessarilyincrease faster than in any society that has ever yet been known. I have beforementioned, that the inhabitants of the back settlements of America appear todouble their numbers in fifteen years. England is certainly a more healthycountry than the back settlements of America; and as we have supposed everyhouse in the island to be airy and wholesome, and the encouragements to have afamily, greater even than in America, no probable reason can be assigned, whythe population should not double itself, in less, if possible, than fifteenyears. But to be quite sure that we do not go beyond the truth, we will onlysuppose the period of doubling to be twenty-five years; a ratio of increasewhich is well known to have taken place throughout all the northern states ofAmerica.There can be little doubt, that the equalization of property which we havesupposed, added to the circumstance of the labour of the whole community beingdirected chiefly to agriculture, would tend greatly to augment the produce ofthe country. But to answer the demands of a population increasing so rapidly,Mr. Godwin’s calculation of half an hour a day would certainly not besufficient. It is probable, that the half of every man’s time must be employedfor this purpose. Yet with such, or much greater exertions, a person who isacquainted with the nature of the soil in this country, and who reflects on thefertility of the lands already in cultivation, and the barrenness of those thatare not cultivated, will be very much disposed to doubt, whether the wholeaverage produce could possibly be doubled in twenty-five years from the presentperiod. The only chance of success would be from the ploughing up most of thegrazing countries, and putting an end almost entirely to animal food. Yet thisscheme would probably defeat itself. The soil of England will not produce muchwithout dressing; and cattle seem to be necessary to make that species of manurewhich best suits the land.Difficult, however, as it might be, to double the average produce of the islandin twenty-five years, let us suppose it effected. At the expiration of the firstperiod, therefore, the food, though almost entirely vegetable, would besufficient to support in health the doubled population of 22 millions.During the next period, where will the food be found to satisfy the importunatedemands of the increasing numbers? Where is the fresh land to turn up? Where isthe dressing necessary to improve that which is already in cultivation? There isno person with the smallest knowledge of land, but would say, that it wasimpossible that the average produce of the country could be increased during thesecond twenty-five years, by a quantity equal to what it at present yields. Yetwe will suppose this increase, however improbable, to take place. The exuberantstrength of the argument allows of almost any concession. Even with thisconcession, however, there would be eleven millions at the expiration of thesecond term unprovided for. A quantity equal to the frugal support of 33millions would be to be divided among 44 millions.Alas! what becomes of the picture, where men lived in the midst of plenty, whereno man was obliged to provide with anxiety and pain for his restless wants;where the narrow principle of selfishness did not exist; where the mind wasdelivered from her perpetual anxiety about corporeal support, and free toexpatiate in the field of thought which is congenial to her. This beautifulfabrick of the imagination vanishes at the severe touch of truth. The spirit ofbenevolence, cherished and invigorated by plenty, is repressed by the chillingbreath of want. The hateful passions that had vanished reappear. The mighty lawof self-preservation expels all the softer, and more exalted emotions of thesoul. The temptations to evil are too strong for human nature to resist. Thecorn is plucked before it is ripe, or secreted in unfair proportions; and thewhole black train of vices that belong to falsehood are immediately generated.Provisions no longer flow in for the support of a mother with a large family.The children are sickly from insufficient food. The rosy flush of health givesplace to the pallid cheek, and hollow eye of misery. Benevolence, yet lingeringin a few bosoms, makes some faint expiring struggles, till at length self-loveresumes his wonted empire, and lords it triumphant over the world.No human institutions here existed, to the perverseness of which Mr. Godwinascribes the original sin of the worst men.6[43_II__Of_systems_of_equality__Godw.html#id_1093] No opposition had beenproduced by them between publick and private good. No monopoly had been createdof those advantages which reason directs to be left in common. No man had beengoaded to the breach of order by unjust laws. Benevolence had established herreign in all hearts. And yet in so short a period as fifty years, violence,oppression, falsehood, misery, every hateful vice, and every form of distress,which degrade and sadden the present state of society, seem to have beengenerated by the most imperious circumstances, by laws inherent in the nature ofman, and absolutely independent of all human regulations.If we be not yet too well convinced of the reality of this melancholy picture,let us but look for a moment into the next period of twenty-five years, and weshall see 44 millions of human beings without the means of support: and at theconclusion of the first century, the population would be 176 millions, and thefood only sufficient for 55 millions, leaving 121 millions unprovided for. Inthese ages, want, indeed, would be triumphant, and rapine and murder must reignat large: and yet all this time we are supposing the produce of the earthabsolutely unlimited, and the yearly increase greater than the boldestspeculator can imagine.This is undoubtedly a very different view of the difficulty arising from theprinciple of population, from that which Mr. Godwin gives, when he says,“Myriads of centuries of still increasing population may pass away, and theearth be still found sufficient for the subsistence of its inhabitants.”I am sufficiently aware, that the redundant millions, which I have mentioned,could never have existed. It is a perfectly just observation of Mr. Godwin,that, “there is a principle in human society by which popula-“tion isperpetually kept down to the level of the means of subsistence.” The solequestion is, what is this principle? Is it some obscure and occult cause? Is itsome mysterious interference of heaven, which at a certain period strikes themen with impotence, and the women with barrenness? Or is it a cause, open to ourresearches, within our view; a cause, which has constantly been observed tooperate, though with varied force, in every state in which man has been placed.Is it not misery, and the fear of misery, the necessary and inevitable resultsof the laws of nature, which human institutions, so far from aggravating, havetended considerably to mitigate, though they can never remove.It may be curious to observe, in the case that we have been supposing, how someof the principal laws which at present govern civilized society, would besuccessively dictated by the most imperious necessity. As man, according to Mr.Godwin, is the creature of the impressions to which he is subject, the goadingsof want could not continue long, before some violations of publick or privatestock would necessarily take place. As these violations increased in number andextent, the more active and comprehensive intellects of the society would soonperceive, that, while population was fast increasing, the yearly produce of thecountry would shortly begin to diminish. The urgency of the case would suggestthe necessity of some immediate measures being taken for the general safety.Some kind of convention would then be called, and the dangerous situation of thecountry stated in the strongest terms. It would be observed, that while theylived in the midst of plenty, it was of little consequence who laboured theleast, or who possessed the least, as every man was perfectly willing and readyto supply the wants of his neighbour. But, that the question was no longer,whether one man should give to another, that which he did not use himself; butwhether he should give to his neighbour the food which was absolutely necessaryto his own existence. It would be represented, that the number of those whichwere in want, very greatly exceeded the number and means of those who shouldsupply them; that these pressing wants, which, from the state of the produce ofthe country, could not all be gratified, had occasioned some flagrant violationsof justice; that these violations had already checked the increase of food, andwould, if they were not by some means or other prevented, throw the wholecommunity into confusion; that imperious necessity seemed to dictate, that ayearly increase of produce should, if possible, be obtained at all events; that,in order to effect this first great and indispensable purpose, it would beadviseable to make a more complete division of land, and to secure every man’sproperty against violation, by the most powerful sanctions.It might be urged, perhaps, by some objectors, that, as the fertility of theland increased, and various accidents occurred, the shares of some men might bemuch more than sufficient for their support; and that, when the reign ofself-love was once established, they would not distribute their surplus producewithout some compensation in return. It would be observed, in answer, that thiswas an inconvenience greatly to be lamented; but that it was an evil, whichwould bear no comparison to the black train of distresses which would inevitablybe occasioned by the insecurity of property; that the quantity of food which oneman could consume, was necessarily limited by the narrow capacity of the humanstomach; that it was not certainly probable that he should throw away the rest;and if he exchanged his surplus produce for the labour of others, this would bebetter than that these others should absolutely starve.It seems highly probable, therefore, that an administration of property, notvery different from that which prevails in civilized states at present, would beestablished, as the best, though inadequate, remedy, for the evils which werepressing on the society.The next subject which would come under discussion, intimately connected withthe preceding, is, the commerce of the sexes. It would be urged by those who hadturned their attention to the true cause of the difficulties under which thecommunity laboured, that while every man felt secure that all his children wouldbe well provided for by general benevolence, the powers of the earth would beabsolutely inadequate to produce food for the population, which would inevitablyensue; that, even if the whole attention and labour of the society were directedto this sole point, and if, by the most perfect security of property, and everyother encouragement that could be thought of, the greatest possible increase ofproduce were yearly obtained; yet still, the increase of food would by no meanskeep pace with the much more rapid increase of population; that some check topopulation, therefore, was imperiously called for; that the most natural andobvious check seemed to be, to make every man provide for his own children; thatthis would operate in some respect as a measure and a guide in the increase ofpopulation, as it might be expected that no man would bring beings into theworld, for whom he could not find the means of support; that, where this,notwithstanding, was the case, it seemed necessary, for the example of others,that the disgrace and inconvenience attending such a conduct, should fall uponthat individual, who had thus inconsiderately plunged himself and his innocentchildren into want and misery.The institution of marriage, or at least of some express or implied obligationon every man to support his own children, seems to be the natural result ofthese reasonings, in a community under the difficulties that we have supposed.The view of these difficulties, presents us with a very natural reason why thedisgrace which attends a breach of chastity, should be greater in a woman thanin a man. It could not be expected that women should have resources sufficientto support their own children. When, therefore, a woman had lived with a man,who had entered into no compact to maintain her children; and aware of theinconveniences that he might bring upon himself, had deserted her, thesechildren must necessarily fall upon the society for support, or starve. And toprevent the frequent recurrence of such an inconvenience, as it would be highlyunjust to punish so natural a fault by personal restraint or infliction, the menmight agree to punish it with disgrace. The offence is, besides, more obviousand conspicuous in the woman, and less liable to any mistake. The father of achild may not always be known; but the same uncertainty cannot easily exist withregard to the mother. Where the evidence of the offence was most complete, andthe inconvenience to the society, at the same time, the greatest; there, it wasagreed, that the largest share of blame should fall. The obligation on every manto support his children, the society would enforce by positive laws; and thegreater degree of inconvenience or labour to which a family would necessarilysubject him, added to some portion of disgrace, which every human being mustincur, who leads another into unhappiness, might be considered as a sufficientpunishment for the man.That a woman should, at present, be almost driven from society, for an offencewhich men commit nearly with impunity, seems to be, undoubtedly, a breach ofnatural justice. But the origin of the custom, as the most obvious and effectualmethod of preventing the frequent recurrence of a serious inconvenience to acommunity, appears to be natural, though not perhaps, perfectly justifiable.This origin, however, is now lost in the new train of ideas, that the custom hassince generated. What at first might be dictated by state necessity, is nowsupported by female delicacy; and operates with the greatest force on that partof the society, where, if the original intention of the custom were preserved,there is the least real occasion for it.When these two fundamental laws of society, the security of property, and theinstitution of marriage, were once established, inequality of conditions mustnecessarily follow. Those who were born, after the division of property, wouldcome into a world already possessed. If their parents, from having too large afamily, were unable to give them sufficient for their support, what could theydo in a world where every thing was appropriated. We have seen the fatal effectsthat would result to society, if every man had a valid claim to an equal shareof the produce of the earth. The members of a family which was grown too largefor the original division of land appropriated to it, could not then demand apart of the surplus produce of others as a debt of justice. It has appeared,that, from the inevitable laws of human nature, some human beings will beexposed to want. These are the unhappy persons who in the great lottery of lifehave drawn a blank. The number of these persons would soon exceed the ability ofthe surplus produce to supply. Moral merit is a very difficult criterion, exceptin extreme cases. The owners of surplus produce would, in general, seek somemore obvious mark of distinction; and it seems to be both natural and just,that, except upon particular occasions, their choice should fall upon those, whowere able, and professed themselves willing, to exert their strength inprocuring a further surplus produce, which would at once benefit the community,and enable the proprietors to afford assistance to greater numbers. All who werein want of food, would be urged by imperious necessity to offer their labour inexchange for this article, so absolutely necessary to existence. The fundappropriated to the maintenance of labour, would be the aggregate quantity offood possessed by the owners of land beyond their own consumption. When thedemands upon this fund were great and numerous, it would naturally be dividedinto very small shares. Labour would be ill paid. Men would offer to work for abare subsistence; and the rearing of families would be checked by sickness andmisery. On the contrary, when this fund was increasing fast; when it was greatin proportion to the number of claimants, it would be divided in much largershares. No man would exchange his labour without receiving an ample quantity offood in return. Labourers would live in ease and comfort, and would consequentlybe able to rear a numerous and vigorous offspring.On the state of this fund, the happiness, or the degree of misery, prevailingamong the lower classes of people, in every known state, at present chieflydepends; and on this happiness, or degree of misery, depends principally theincrease, stationariness, or decrease, of population.And thus, it appears, that a society constituted according to the most beautifulform that imagination can conceive, with benevolence for its moving principle,instead of self-love, and with every evil disposition in all its memberscorrected by reason, not force, would, from the inevitable laws of nature, andnot from any original depravity of man, or of human institutions, degenerate, ina very short period, into a society, constructed upon a plan, not essentiallydifferent from that which prevails in every known state at present; a society,divided into a class of proprietors and a class of labourers, and with self-lovefor the mainspring of the great machine.In the supposition which I have made, I have undoubtedly taken the increase ofpopulation smaller, and the increase of produce greater, than they really wouldbe. No reason can be assigned why, under the circumstances supposed, populationshould not increase faster than in any known instance. If, then, we were to takethe period of doubling at fifteen years, instead of twenty-five years, andreflect upon the labour necessary to double the produce in so short a time, evenif we allow it possible; we may venture to pronounce with certainty, that, ifMr. Godwin’s system of society were established in its utmost perfection,instead of myriads of centuries, not thirty years could elapse, before its utterdestruction from the simple principle of population.I have taken no notice of emigration in this place, for obvious reasons. If suchsocieties were instituted in other parts of Europe, these countries would beunder the same difficulties, with regard to population, and could admit no freshmembers into their bosoms. If this beautiful society were confined to thisisland, it must have degenerated strangely from its original purity, andadminister but a very small portion of the happiness it proposed, before any ofits members would voluntarily consent to leave it, and live under suchgovernments as at present exist in Europe, or submit to the extreme hardships offirst settlers in new regions.NOTES1 [43_II__Of_systems_of_equality__Godw.html#id_1086]. p. 460. 8vo. 2d edit.2 [43_II__Of_systems_of_equality__Godw.html#id_2192].

Godwin, in a late publication, has replied to those parts of the Essay onthe Principle of Population, which he thinks bear the hardest on his system. Afew remarks on this reply will be sufficient.In a note to an early part of his pamphlet, he observes, that the main attack ofthe essay, is not directed against the principles of his work, but itsconclusion.1 [44_III__Observations_on_the_Reply_o.html#id_1095] It may be true,indeed, that, as Mr. Godwin had dedicated one particular chapter towards theconclusion of his work, to the consideration of the objections to his system,from the principle of population, this particular chapter is most frequentlyalluded to: but certainly, if the great principle of the essay be admitted, itaffects his whole work, and essentially alters the foundations of politicaljustice. A great part of Mr. Godwin’s book consists of an abuse of humaninstitutions, as productive of all, or most of, the evils which afflict society.The acknowledgment of a new and totally unconsidered cause of misery, wouldevidently alter the state of these arguments, and make it absolutely necessarythat they should be either newly modified, or entirely rejected.In the first book of Political Justice, chap. iii[44_III__Observations_on_the_Reply_o.html#page_300]. entitled, “The Spirit ofPolitical Institutions,” Mr. Godwin observes, that “Two of the greatest abusesrelative to the interior policy of nations which at this time prevail in theworld, consist in the irregular transfer of property, either first, by violence,or secondly, by fraud.” And he goes on to say, that if there existed no desirein individuals to possess themselves of the substance of others, and if everyman could, with perfect facility, obtain the necessaries of life, civil societymight become what poetry has feigned of the golden age. Let us inquire, he says,into the principles to which these evils are indebted for existence. Afteracknowledging the truth of the principal argument in the essay on population, Ido not think that he could stop in this inquiry at mere human institutions. Manyother parts of his work would be affected by this consideration in a similarmanner.As Mr. Godwin seems disposed to understand, and candidly to admit the truth of,the principal argument in the essay, I feel the more mortified, that he shouldthink it a fair inference from my positions, that the political superintendentsof a community are bound to exercise a paternal vigilance and care over the twogreat means of advantage and safety to mankind, misery and vice; and that noevil is more to be dreaded than that we should have too little of them in theworld, to confine the principle of population within its proper sphere.2[44_III__Observations_on_the_Reply_o.html#id_1097] I am at a loss to conceivewhat class of evils Mr. Godwin imagines is yet behind, which these salutarychecks are to prevent. For my own part, I know of no stronger or more generalterms than vice and misery; and the sole question is, respecting a greater orless degree of them. The only reason why I object to Mr. Godwin’s system, is, myfull conviction that an attempt to execute it, would very greatly increase thequantity of vice and misery in society. If Mr. Godwin will undo this conviction,and prove to me, though it be only in theory, provided that theory beconsistent, and founded on a knowledge of human nature, that his system willreally tend to drive vice and misery from the earth, he may depend upon havingme one of its steadiest and warmest advocates.Mr. Godwin observes, that he should naturally be disposed to pronounce that manstrangely indifferent to schemes of extraordinary improvement in society, whomade it a conclusive argument against them, that, when they were realized, theymight peradventure be of no permanence and duration. And yet, what is morality,individual or political, according to Mr. Godwin’s own definition of it, but acalculation of consequences? Is the physician the patron of pain, who adviseshis patient to bear a present evil, rather than betake himself to a remedy,which, though it might give momentary relief, would afterwards greatly aggravateall the symptoms? Is the moralist to be called an enemy to pleasure, because herecommends to a young man just entering into life, not to ruin his health andpatrimony in a few years, by an excess of present gratifications, but toeconomize his enjoyments, that he may spread them over a longer period? Of Mr.Godwin’s system, according to the present arguments by which it is supported, itis not enough to say, peradventure it will be of no permanence; but we canpronounce with certainty that it will be of no permanence: and under suchcircumstances an attempt to execute it would unquestionably be a great politicalimmorality.Mr. Godwin observes, that after recovering from the first impression made by theEssay on Population, the first thing that is apt to strike every reflectingmind, is, that the excess of power in the principle of population over theprinciple of subsistence, has never, in any past instance, in any quarter, orage, of the world, produced those great and astonishing effects, that totalbreaking-up of all the structures and maxims of society, which the essay lead usto expect from it in certain cases in future.3[44_III__Observations_on_the_Reply_o.html#id_1101] This is undoubtedly true; andthe reason is, that, in no past instance, nor in any quarter, or age, of theworld, has an attempt been made to establish such a system as Mr. Godwin’s, andwithout an attempt of this nature, none of these great effects will follow. Theconvulsions of the social system, described in the last chapter, appeared by akind of irresistible necessity, to terminate in the establishment of the laws ofproperty and marriage; but in countries, where these laws are alreadyestablished, as they are in all the common constitutions of society, with whichwe are acquainted, the operation of the principle of population will always besilent and gradual, and not different to what we daily see in our own country.Other persons, besides Mr. Godwin, have imagined, that I looked to certainperiods in future, when population would exceed the means of subsistence in amuch greater degree than at present, and that the evils arising from theprinciple of population were rather in contemplation, than in existence; butthis is a total misconception of the argument.4[44_III__Observations_on_the_Reply_o.html#id_1099] Poverty, and not absolutefamine, is the specifick effect of the principle of population, as I have beforeendeavoured to shew. Many countries are now suffering all the evils that canever be expected to flow from this principle, and even, if we were arrived atthe absolute limit to all further increase of produce, a point, which we shallcertainly never reach, I should by no means expect that these evils would be inany marked manner aggravated. The increase of produce in most European countriesis so very slow, compared with what would be required to support an unrestrictedincrease of people, that the checks which are constantly in action to repressthe population to the level of a produce increasing so slowly, would have verylittle more to do in wearing it down to a produce absolutely stationary.But Mr. Godwin says, that if he looks into the past history of the world, hedoes not see that increasing population has been controlled and confined by viceand misery alone. In this observation I cannot agree with him. I will thank Mr.Godwin to name to me any check, which in past ages has contributed to keep downthe population to the level of the means of subsistence, that does not fairlycome under some form of vice or misery; except indeed the check of moralrestraint, which I have mentioned in the course of this work; and which, to saythe truth, whatever hopes we may entertain of its prevalence in future, hasundoubtedly in past ages operated with very inconsiderable force.I do not think that I should find it difficult to justify myself in the eyes ofmy readers from the imputation of being the patron of vice and misery; but I amnot clear, that Mr. Godwin would find such a justification so easy. For thoughhe has positively declared that he does not “regard them with complacency;” andhopes that it may not be considered as a taste absolutely singular in him thathe should entertain no vehement partialities for vice and misery;”5[44_III__Observations_on_the_Reply_o.html#id_1107] yet he has certainly exposedhimself to the suspicion of having this singular taste, by suggesting theorganization of a very large portion of them for the benefit of society ingeneral. On this subject I need only observe, that I have always ranked the twochecks6 [44_III__Observations_on_the_Reply_o.html#id_1105] which he firstmentions, among the worst forms of vice and misery.In one part of his Reply, Mr. Godwin makes a supposition respecting the numberof children that might be allowed to each prolifick marriage; but as he has notentered into the detail of the mode by which a greater number might beprevented, I shall not notice it further, than merely to observe, that althoughhe professes to acknowledge the geometrical and arithmetical ratios ofpopulation and food, yet in this place he appears to think that, practicallyapplied, these different ratios of increase, are not of a nature to make theevil resulting from them urgent, or alarmingly to confine the natural progressof population.7 [44_III__Observations_on_the_Reply_o.html#id_1103] Thisobservation seems to contradict his former acknowledgment.The last check which Mr. Godwin mentions, and which, I am persuaded, is the onlyone which he would seriously recommend, is, “that sentiment, whether virtue,prudence, or pride, which continually restrains the universality and frequentrepetition of the marriage contract.”8[44_III__Observations_on_the_Reply_o.html#id_1109] On this sentiment, which Ihave already noticed under the name of moral restraint, and of the morecomprehensive title, the preventive check, it will appear, that in the sequel ofthis work I shall lay considerable stress. Of this check therefore itself, Ientirely approve; but I do not think that Mr. Godwin’s system of politicaljustice is by any means favourable to its prevalence. The tendency to earlymarriages is so strong that we want every possible help that we can get tocounteract it; and a system which in any way whatever tends to weaken thefoundation of private property, and to lessen in any degree the full advantageand superiority which each individual may derive from his prudence, must removethe only counteracting weight to the passion of love, that can be depended uponfor any essential effect. Mr. Godwin acknowledges that in his system, “the illconsequences of a numerous family will not come so coarsely home to each man’sindividual interest as they do at present.”9[44_III__Observations_on_the_Reply_o.html#id_2197] But I am sorry to say that,from what we know hitherto of the human character, we can have no rational hopesof success, without this coarse application to individual interest, which Mr.Godwin rejects. If the whole effect were to depend merely on a sense of duty,considering the powerful antagonist that is to be contended with, in the presentcase, I confess that I should absolutely despair. At the same time, I amstrongly of opinion that a sense of duty, superadded to a sense of interest,would by no means be without its effect. There are many noble and disinterestedspirits, who, though aware of the inconveniences which they may bring uponthemselves by the indulgence of an early and virtuous passion, feel a kind ofrepugnance to listen to the dictates of mere worldly prudence, and a pride inrejecting these low considerations. There is a kind of romantick gallantry insacrificing all for love, naturally fascinating to a young mind; and, to say thetruth, if all is to be sacrificed, I do not know, in what better cause it can bedone. But if a strong sense of duty could, in these instances, be added toprudential suggestions, the whole question might wear a different colour. Indelaying the gratification of passion, from a sense of duty, the mostdisinterested spirit, the most delicate honour, might be satisfied. Theromantick pride might take a different direction, and the dictates of worldlyprudence might be followed with the cheerful consciousness of making a virtuoussacrifice.If we were to remove or weaken the motive of interest, which would be the casein Mr. Godwin’s system, I fear we should have but a weak substitute in a senseof duty. But if to the present beneficial effects, known to result from a senseof interest, we could superadd a sense of duty, which is the object of thelatter part of this work, it does not seem absolutely hopeless that some partialimprovement in society should result from it.NOTES1 [44_III__Observations_on_the_Reply_o.html#id_1094].

Mr. Godwin does notacknowledge the justice of Hume’s observation respecting infanticide; and yetthe extreme population and poverty in China, where this custom prevails, tendsstrongly to confirm the observation. It is still, however, true, as Mr. Godwinobserves, that the expedient is, in its own nature, adequate to the end forwhich it was cited, (p. 66.); but, to make it so in fact, it must be done by themagistrate, and not left to the parents. The almost invariable tendency of thiscustom to increase population, when it depends entirely on the parents, shewsthe extreme pain which they must feel, in making such a sacrifice, even when thedistress arising from excessive poverty may be supposed to have deadened ingreat measure their sensibility. What must this pain be then, upon thesupposition of the interference of a magistrate or of a positive law, to makeparents destroy a child, which they feel the desire, and think they possess thepower, of supporting? The permission of infanticide is bad enough, and cannotbut have a bad effect on the moral sensibility of a nation; but, I cannotconceive any thing much more detestable, or shocking to the feelings, than anydirect regulation of this kind, although sanctioned by the names of Plato andAristotle.7 [44_III__Observations_on_the_Reply_o.html#id_1102].

IV.Of Emigration.ALTHOUGH the resource of emigration seems to be excluded from such a society asMr. Godwin has imagined; yet in that partial degree of improvement which alonecan rationally be expected, it may fairly enter into our consideration. And asit is not probable, that human industry should begin to receive its bestdirection, throughout all the nations of the earth at the same time, it may besaid, that in the case of a redundant population in the more cultivated parts ofthe world, the natural and obvious remedy that presents itself, is, emigrationto those parts that are uncultivated. As these parts are of great extent, andvery thinly peopled, this resource might appear, on a first view of the subject,an adequate remedy, or at least of a nature to remove the evil to a distantperiod: but, when we advert to experience, and to the actual state of theuncivilized parts of the globe, instead of any thing like an adequate remedy, itwill appear but a very weak palliative.In the accounts which we have of the peopling of new countries, the dangers,difficulties, and hardships, that the first settlers have had to struggle with,appear to be even greater, than we can well imagine that they could be exposedto, in their parent state. The endeavour to avoid that degree of unhappinessarising from the difficulty of supporting a family, might long have left the newworld of America unpeopled by Europeans, if those more powerful passions, thethirst of gain, the spirit of adventure, and religious enthusiasm, had notdirected and animated the enterprize. These passions enabled the firstadventurers to triumph over every obstacle; but in many instances in a way tomake humanity shudder, and to defeat the true end of emigration. Whatever may bethe character of the Spanish inhabitants of Mexico and Peru at the presentmoment, we cannot read the accounts of the first conquests of these countries,without feeling strongly, that the race destroyed, was, in moral worth, as wellas numbers, highly superior to the race of their destroyers.The parts of America settled by the English, from being thinly peopled, werebetter adapted to the establishment of new colonies; yet even here, the mostformidable difficulties presented themselves. In the settlement of Virginia,begun by Sir Walter Raleigh, and established by Lord Delaware, three attemptscompletely failed. Nearly half of the first colony was destroyed by the savages,and the rest consumed and worn down by fatigue and famine, deserted the country,and returned home in despair. The second colony was cut off to a man, in amanner unknown; but they were supposed to be destroyed by the Indians. The thirdexperienced the same dismal fate; and the remains of the fourth, after it hadbeen reduced by famine and disease, in the course of six months from 500 to 60persons, were returning in a famishing and desperate condition to England, whenthey were met in the mouth of the Chesapeak bay, by Lord Delaware, with asquadron loaded with provisions, and every thing for their relief and defence.1[45_IV__Of_emigration.html#id_1113]The first puritan settlers in New England were few in number. They landed in abad season, and they were only supported by their private funds. The winter waspremature, and terribly cold; the country was covered with wood, and affordedvery little for the refreshment of persons, sickly with such a voyage, or forthe sustenance of an infant people. Nearly half of them perished by the scurvy,by want, and the severity of the climate; but they who survived were notdispirited by their hardships; but, supported by their energy of character, andthe satisfaction of finding themselves out of the reach of the spiritual arm,reduced this savage country, by degrees, to yield them a comfortablesubsistence.2 [45_IV__Of_emigration.html#id_1111]Even the plantation of Barbadoes, which increased afterwards with suchextraordinary rapidity, had at first to contend with a country utterly desolate,an extreme want of provisions, a difficulty in clearing the ground unusuallygreat, from the uncommon size and hardness of the trees, a most dishearteningscantiness and poverty in their first crops, and a slow and precarious supply ofprovisions from England.3 [45_IV__Of_emigration.html#id_2199]The attempt of the French, in 1663, to form at once a powerful colony in Guiana,was attended with the most disastrous consequences. Twelve thousand men werelanded in the rainy season, and placed under tents and miserable sheds. In thissituation, inactive, weary of existence, and in want of all necessaries, exposedto contagious distempers, which are always occasioned by bad provisions, and toall the irregularities which idleness produces among the lower classes ofsociety, almost the whole of them ended their lives in all the horrors ofdespair. The attempt was completely abortive. Two thousand men, whose robustconstitutions had enabled them to resist the inclemency of the climate, and themiseries to which they had been exposed, were brought back to France; and the25,000,000 of livres which had been expended in the expedition were totallylost.4 [45_IV__Of_emigration.html#id_1115]In the last settlement at Port Jackson, in New Holland, a melancholy andaffecting picture is drawn by Collins, of the extreme hardships which, for someyears, the infant colony had to struggle with, before the produce was equal toits support. These distresses were undoubtedly aggravated by the character ofthe settlers; but those which were caused by the unhealthiness of anewly-cleared country, the failure of first crops, and the uncertainty ofsupplies from so distant a mother country, were of themselves sufficientlydisheartening, to place in a strong point of view, the necessity of greatresources, as well as unconquerable perseverance, in the colonization of savagecountries.The establishment of colonies, in the more thinly peopled regions of Europe andAsia would evidently require still greater resources. From the power, andwarlike character, of the inhabitants of these countries, a considerablemilitary force would be necessary to prevent their utter and immediatedestruction. Even the frontier provinces of the most powerful states, aredefended with considerable difficulty from such restless neighbours; and thepeaceful labours of the cultivator, are continually interrupted by theirpredatory incursions. The late Empress Catharine of Russia found it necessary toprotect, by regular fortresses, the colonies which she had established in thedistricts near the Wolga; and the calamities which her subjects suffered by theincursions of the Crim Tartars furnished a pretext, and perhaps a just one, fortaking possession of the whole of the Crimea, and expelling the greatest part ofthese turbulent neighbours, and reducing the rest to a more tranquil mode oflife.The difficulties attending a first establishment, from soil, climate, and thewant of proper conveniences, are of course nearly the same in these regions asin America. Mr. Eton, in his account of the Turkish Empire, says, that 75,000Christians were obliged by Russia to emigrate from the Crimea, and sent toinhabit the country abandoned by the Nogai Tartars; but the winter coming onbefore the houses built for them were ready, a great part of them had no othershelter from the cold, than what was afforded them by holes dug in the ground,covered with what they could procure, and the greatest part of them perished.Only seven thousand remained a few years afterwards. Another colony from Italyto the banks of the Borysthenes, had, he says, no better fate, owing to the badmanagement of those who were commissioned to provide for them.It is needless to add to these instances, as the accounts given of thedifficulties experienced in new settlements are all nearly similar. It has beenjustly observed, by a correspondent of Dr. Franklin, that one of the reasons whywe have seen so many fruitless attempts to settle colonies at an immense publickand private expence, by several of the powers of Europe, is, that the moral andmechanical habits adapted to the mother country are frequently not so, to thenew-settled one, and to external events, many of which are unforeseen; and thatit is to be remarked, that none of the English colonies became any wayconsiderable, till the necessary manners were born and grew up in the country.Pallas particularly notices the want of proper habits in the colonies,established by Russia, as one of the causes why they did not increase so fast asmight have been expected.In addition to this, it may be observed, that the first establishment of a newcolony, generally presents an instance of a country, peopled considerably beyondits actual produce; and the natural consequence seems to be, that thispopulation, if not amply supplied by the mother country, should, at thebeginning, be diminished to the level of the first scanty productions, and notbegin permanently to increase till the remaining numbers had so far cultivatedthe soil, as to make it yield a quantity of food, more than sufficient for theirown support; and which consequently they could divide with a family. Thefrequent failures in the establishment of new colonies tend strongly to show theorder of precedence between food and population.It must be acknowledged then, that the class of people on whom the distressarising from a too rapidly increasing population would principally fall, couldnot possibly begin a new colony in a distant country. From the nature of theirsituation, they must necessarily be deficient in those resources, which alonecould ensure success: and unless they could find leaders among the higherclasses, urged by the spirit of avarice or enterprize; or of religious orpolitical discontent; or were furnished with means and support by government;whatever degree of misery they might suffer in their own country, from thescarcity of subsistence, they would be absolutely unable to take possession ofany of those uncultivated regions, of which there is yet such an extent on theearth.When new colonies have been once securely established, the difficulty ofemigration is, indeed, very considerably diminished; yet, even then, someresources are necessary to provide vessels for the voyage, and support andassistance till the emigrants can settle themselves, and find employment intheir adopted country. How far it is incumbent upon a government to furnishthese resources, may be a question; but whatever be its duty in this particular,perhaps it is too much to expect, that except where any particular colonialadvantages are proposed, emigration should be actively assisted.The necessary resources for transport and maintenance, are, however, frequentlyfurnished by individuals, or private companies. For many years before theAmerican war, and for some few since, the facilities of emigration to this newworld, and the probable advantages in view, were unusually great; and it must beconsidered undoubtedly as a very happy circumstance for any country, to have socomfortable an asylum for its redundant population. But I would ask, whether,even during these periods, the distress among the common people in this countrywas little or nothing, and whether every man felt secure before he ventured onmarriage, that however large his family might be, he should find no difficultyin supporting it without parish assistance? The answer, I fear, could not be inthe affirmative.It will be said, that when an opportunity of advantageous emigration is offered,it is the fault of the people themselves, if, instead of accepting it, theyprefer a life of celibacy, or extreme poverty in their own country. Is it then afault for a man to feel an attachment to his native soil, to love the parentsthat nurtured him, his kindred, his friends, and the companions of his earlyyears? or is it no evil that he suffers, because he consents to bear it, ratherthan snap these cords which nature has wound in close and intricate folds roundthe human heart? The great plan of providence seems to require, indeed, thatthese ties should sometimes be broken; but the separation does not, on thataccount, give less pain; and, though the general good may be promoted by it, itdoes not cease to be an individual evil. Besides, doubts and uncertainty mustever attend all distant emigrations, particularly in the apprehensions of thelower classes of people. They cannot feel quite secure, that the representationsmade to them of the high price of labour, or the cheapness of land, areaccurately true. They are placing themselves in the power of the persons who areto furnish them with the means of transport and maintenance, who may perhapshave an interest in deceiving them; and the sea which they are to pass, appearsto them like the separation of death from all their former connexions, and in amanner to preclude the possibility of return in case of failure, as they cannotexpect the offer of the same means to bring them back. We cannot be surprisedthen, that, except where a spirit of enterprise is added to the uneasiness ofpoverty, the consideration of these circumstances, should frequently,“Make them rather bear the ills they suffer,Than fly to others which they know not of.”If a tract of rich land as large as this island were suddenly annexed to it, andsold in small lots, or let out in small farms, the case would be very different,and the amelioration of the state of the common people would be sudden andstriking; though the rich would be continually complaining of the high price oflabour, the pride of the lower classes, and the difficulty of getting work done.These, I understand, are not unfrequent complaints among the men of property inAmerica.Every resource, however, from emigration, if used effectually, as this would be,must be of short duration. There is scarcely a state in Europe, except perhapsRussia, the inhabitants of which do not often endeavour to better theircondition by removing to other countries. As these states therefore have nearlyall rather a redundant, than deficient population, in proportion to theirproduce, they cannot be supposed to afford any effectual resources of emigrationto each other. Let us suppose, for a moment, that in this more enlightened partof the globe, the internal economy of each state were so admirably regulated,that no checks existed to population, and the different governments providedevery facility for emigration. Taking the population of Europe, excludingRussia, at a hundred millions, and allowing a greater increase of produce thanis probable, or even possible, in the mother countries, the redundancy of parentstock in a single century, would be eleven hundred millions, which, added to thenatural increase of the colonies, during the same time, would be more thandouble what has been supposed to be the present population of the whole earth.Can we imagine, that in the uncultivated parts of Asia, Africa, or America, thegreatest exertions, and the best directed endeavours, could in so short aperiod, prepare a quantity of land, sufficient for the support of such apopulation. If any sanguine person should feel a doubt upon the subject, let himonly add 25 or 50 years more, and every doubt must be crushed in overwhelmingconviction.It is evident, therefore, that the reason why the resource of emigration has solong continued to be held out as a remedy to redundant population, is, because,from the natural unwillingness of people to desert their native country, and thedifficulty of clearing and cultivating fresh soil, it never is, nor can be,adequately adopted. If this remedy were indeed really effectual, and had powerso far to relieve the disorders of vice and misery in old states, as to placethem in the condition of the most prosperous new colonies, we should soon seethe phial exhausted, and when the disorders returned with increased virulence,every hope from that quarter would be for ever closed.It is clear, therefore, that with any view of making room for an unrestrictedincrease of population, emigration is perfectly inadequate; but as a partial andtemporary expedient, and with a view to the more general cultivation of theearth, and the wider spread of civilization, it seems to be both useful andproper; and if it cannot be proved that governments are bound actively toencourage it, it is not only strikingly unjust, but in the highest degreeimpolitick, in them to prevent it. There are no fears so totally ill-grounded,as the fears of depopulation from emigration. The vis inertiœ of people ingeneral, and their attachment to their homes, are qualities so strong, andgeneral, that we may rest assured that they will not emigrate, unless, frompolitical discontents, or extreme poverty, they are in such a state, as willmake it as much for the advantage of their country as of themselves that theyshould go out of it. The complaints of high wages in consequence of emigrationsare, of all others, the most unreasonable, and ought the least to be attendedto. If the wages of labour in any country be such, as to enable the lowerclasses of people to live with tolerable comfort, we may be quite certain, thatthey will not emigrate; and if they be not such, it is cruelty and injustice todetain them.NOTES1 [45_IV__Of_emigration.html#id_1112].

V.Of the English Poor Laws.TO remedy the frequent distresses of the poor, laws to enforce their relief havebeen instituted; and in the establishment of a general system of this kind,England has particularly distinguished herself. But it is to be feared, thatthough it may have alleviated a little the intensity of individual misfortune,it has spread the evil over a much larger surface.It is a subject often started in conversation, and mentioned always as a matterof great surprise, that, notwithstanding the immense sum which is annuallycollected for the poor in this country, there is still so much distress amongthem. Some think that the money must be embezzled for private use; others, thatthe churchwardens and overseers consume the greatest part of it in feasting. Allagree, that somehow or other, it must be very ill managed. In short, the fact,that, even before the late scarcities, three millions were collected annuallyfor the poor, and yet that their distresses were not removed, is the subject ofcontinual astonishment. But a man who looks a little below the surface ofthings, would be much more astonished, if the fact were otherwise than it isobserved to be; or even if a collection universally of eighteen shillings in thepound, instead of four, were materially to alter it.Suppose, that by a subscription of the rich, the eighteen-pence, or twoshillings, which men earn now, were made up five shillings, it might beimagined, perhaps, that they would then be able to live comfortably, and have apiece of meat every day for their dinner. But this would be a very falseconclusion. The transfer of three additional shillings a day to each labourerwould not increase the quantity of meat in the country. There is not at presentenough for all to have a moderate share. What would then be the consequence? Thecompetition among the buyers in the market of meat, would rapidly raise theprice from eight pence or nine pence, to two or three shillings in the pound,and the commodity would not be divided among many more than it is at present.When an article is scarce, and cannot be distributed to all, he that can shewthe most valid patent, that is, he that offers the most money, becomes thepossessor. If we can suppose the competition among the buyers of meat, tocontinue long enough for a greater number of cattle to be reared annually, thiscould only be done at the expence of the corn, which would be a verydisadvantageous exchange; for it is well known, that the country could not thensupport the same population; and when subsistence is scarce in proportion to thenumber of people, it is of little consequence, whether the lowest members of thesociety possess two shillings or five. They must, at all events, be reduced tolive upon the hardest fare, and in the smallest quantity.It might be said, perhaps, that the increased number of purchasers in everyarticle would give a spur to productive industry, and that the whole produce ofthe island would be increased. But the spur that these fancied riches would giveto population, would more than counterbalance it; and the increased producewould be to be divided among a more than proportionably increased number ofpeople.A collection from the rich, of eighteen shillings in the pound, even ifdistributed in the most judicious manner, would have an effect similar to thatresulting from the supposition which I have just made; and no possiblesacrifices of the rich, particularly in money, could, for any time, prevent therecurrence of distress among the lower members of society, who ever they were.Great changes might indeed be made. The rich might become poor, and some of thepoor rich; but, while the present proportion between population and foodcontinues, a part of society must necessarily find it difficult to support afamily, and this difficulty will naturally fall on the least fortunate members.It may at first appear strange, but I believe it is true, that I cannot by meansof money, raise the condition of a poor man, and enable him to live much betterthan he did before, without proportionably depressing others in the same class.If I retrench the quantity of food consumed in my house, and give him what Ihave cut off, I then benefit him without depressing any but myself and family,who perhaps may be well able to bear it. If I turn up a piece of uncultivatedland, and give him the produce, I then benefit both him and all the members ofsociety, because what he before consumed is thrown into the common stock, and,probably, some of the new produce with it. But if I only give him money,supposing the produce of the country to remain the same, I give him a title to alarger share of that produce than formerly, which share he cannot receivewithout diminishing the shares of others. It is evident, that this effect inindividual instances must be so small as to be totally imperceptible; but stillit must exist, as many other effects do, which, like some of the insects thatpeople the air, elude our grosser perceptions.Supposing the quantity of food in any country, to remain the same for many yearstogether, it is evident, that this food must be divided according to the valueof each man’s patent, or the sum of money which he can afford to spend in thiscommodity so universally in request. It is a demonstrative truth, therefore,that the patents of one set of men could not be increased in value, withoutdiminishing the value of the patents of some other set of men. If the rich wereto subscribe, and give five shillings a day to five hundred thousand men,without retrenching their own tables, no doubt can exist that as these men wouldlive more at their ease, and consume a greater quantity of provisions, therewould be less food remaining to divide among the rest; and consequently, eachman’s patent would be diminished in value, or the same number of pieces ofsilver would purchase a smaller quantity of subsistence, and the price ofprovisions would universally rise.These general reasonings have been strikingly confirmed during the latescarcities. The supposition which I have made of a collection from the rich ofeighteen shillings in the pound, has been nearly realized; and the effect hasbeen such as might have been expected. If the same distribution had been made,when no scarcity existed, a considerable advance in the price of provisionswould have been a necessary consequence; but following as it did a scarcity, itseffect must have been doubly powerful. No person, I believe, will venture todoubt, that, if we were to give three additional shillings a day to everylabouring man in the kingdom, as I before supposed, in order that he might havemeat for his dinner, the price of meat would rise in the most rapid andunexampled manner. But surely, in a deficiency of corn, which renders itimpossible for every man to have his usual share, if we still continue tofurnish each person with the means of purchasing the same quantity as before,the effect must be in every respect similar.It seems in great measure to have escaped observation, that the price of corn ina scarcity, will depend much more upon the obstinacy with which the same degreeof consumption is persevered in, than on the degree of the actual deficiency. Adeficiency of one half of a crop, if the people could immediately consent toconsume only one half of what they did before, would produce little or no effecton the price of corn. A deficiency of one twelfth, if exactly the sameconsumption were to continue for ten or eleven months, might raise the price ofcorn to almost any height. The more is given in parish assistance, the morepower is furnished of persevering in the same consumption, and of course thehigher will the price rise before the necessary diminution of consumption iseffected.It has been asserted by some people that high prices do not diminishconsumption. If this were really true, we should see the price of a bushel ofcorn at a hundred pounds or more, in every deficiency, which could not be fullyand completely remedied by importation. But the fact is, that high prices doultimately diminish consumption; but, on account of the riches of the country,the unwillingness of the people to resort to substitutes, and the immense sums,which are distributed by parishes, this object cannot be attained till theprices become excessive, and force even the middle classes of society, or atleast those immediately above the poor, to save in the article of bread from theactual inability of purchasing it in the usual quantity. The poor who wereassisted by their parishes had no reason whatever to complain of the high priceof grain; because it was the excessiveness of this price, and this alone, which,by enforcing such a saving, left a greater quantity of corn, for the consumptionof the lowest classes, which corn, the parish allowances enabled them tocommand. The greatest sufferers in the scarcity were undoubtedly the classesimmediately above the poor; and these were in the most marked manner depressedby the excessive bounties given to those below them. Almost all poverty isrelative; and I much doubt, whether these people would have been rendered sopoor, if a sum equal to half of those bounties had been taken directly out oftheir pockets, as they were, by that new distribution of the money of thesociety which actually took place.1[46_V__Of_the_English_poor_laws.html#id_1117] This distribution by giving to thepoorer classes a command of food, so much greater than their degree of skill andindustry entitled them to, in the actual circumstances of the country,diminished, exactly in the same proportion, that command over the necessaries oflife, which the classes above them, by their superior skill and industry, wouldnaturally possess; and it may be a question, whether the degree of assistancewhich the poor received, and which prevented them from resorting to the use ofthose substitutes, which, in every other country, on such occasions, the greatlaw of necessity teaches, was not more than overbalanced by the severity of thepressure on so large a body of people from the extreme high prices, and thepermanent evil which must result from forcing so many persons on the parish, whobefore thought themselves almost out of the reach of want.If we were to double the fortunes of all those who possess above a hundred ayear, the effect on the price of grain would be slow and inconsiderable; but ifwe were to double the price of labour throughout the kingdom, the effect, inraising the price of grain, would be rapid and great. The general principles onthis subject will not admit of dispute; and that in the particular case which wehave been considering, the bounties to the poor were of a magnitude to operatevery powerfully in this manner, will sufficiently appear, if we recollect, that,before the late scarcities, the sum collected for the poor was estimated atthree millions, and that during the year 1801 it was said to be ten millions. Anadditional seven millions acting at the bottom of the scale,2[46_V__Of_the_English_poor_laws.html#id_1119] and employed exclusively in thepurchase of provisions, joined to a considerable advance in the price of wagesin many parts of the kingdom, and increased by a prodigious sum expended involuntary charity, must have had a most powerful effect in raising the price ofthe necessaries of life, if any reliance can be placed on the clearest generalprinciples, confirmed as much as possible by appearances. A man with a family,has received, to my knowledge, fourteen shillings a week from the parish. Hiscommon earnings were ten shillings a week, and his weekly revenue, therefore,twenty-four. Before the scarcity, he had been in the habit of purchasing abushel of flour a week with eight shillings perhaps, and consequently had twoshillings out of his ten, to spare for other necessaries. During the scarcity,he was enabled to purchase the same quantity at nearly three times the price. Hepaid twenty-two shillings for his bushel of flour, and had, as before, twoshillings remaining for other wants. Such instances could not possibly have beenuniversal, without raising the price of wheat very much higher than it reallywas during any part of the dearth. But similar instances were by no meansinfrequent, and the system itself, of measuring the relief given by the price ofgrain, was general.If the circulation of the country had consisted entirely of specie, which couldnot have been immediately increased; it would have been impossible to give suchan additional sum as seven millions to the poor, without embarrassing, to agreat degree, the operations of commerce. On the commencement, therefore, ofthis extensive relief, which would necessarily occasion a proportionateexpenditure in provisions throughout all the ranks of society, a great demandwould be felt for an increased circulating medium. The nature of the medium thenprincipally in use, was such, that it could be created immediately on demand.From the accounts of the bank of England, as laid before Parliament, it appearedthat no very great additional issues of paper took place from this quarter. Thethree millions and a half added to its former average issues, were not probablymuch above what was sufficient to supply the quantity of specie that had beenwithdrawn from the circulation. If this supposition be true, and the smallquantity of gold which made its appearance at that time, furnishes the strongestreason for believing that as much as this must have been been withdrawn, itwould follow, that the part of the circulation originating in the bank ofEngland, though changed in its nature, had not been increased in its quantity;and with regard to the effect of the circulating medium on the price of allcommodities, it cannot be doubted that it would be precisely the same, whetherit were made up principally of guineas, or of pound notes and shillings, whichwould pass current for guineas.The demand, therefore, for an increased circulating medium was left to besupplied by the country banks, and it could not be expected that they shouldhesitate in taking advantage of so profitable an opportunity. The paper issuesof a country bank are, as I conceive, measured by the quantity of its noteswhich will remain in circulation; and this quantity is again measured, supposinga confidence to be established, by the sum of what is wanted to carry on all themoney transactions of the neighbourhood. From the high price of provisions, allthese transactions became more expensive. In the single article of the weeklypayment of labourers’ wages, including the parish allowances, it is evident,that a very great addition to the circulating medium of the neighbourhood wouldbe wanted.3 [46_V__Of_the_English_poor_laws.html#id_1121] Had the country banksattempted to issue the same quantity of paper. without such a particular demandfor it, they would quickly have been admonished of their error by its rapid andpressing return upon them; but at this time, it was wanted for immediate anddaily use, and was therefore eagerly absorbed into the circulation.It may even admit of a question, whether, under similar circumstances, thecountry banks would not have issued nearly the same quantity of paper, if thebank of England had not been restricted from payment in specie. Before thisevent, the issues of the country banks in paper were regulated by the quantitythat the circulation would take up, and after, as well as before, they wereobliged to pay the notes which returned upon them in bank of Englandcirculation. The difference in the two cases, would arise principally from thepernicious custom, adopted since the restriction of the bank, of issuing one andtwo pound notes, and from the little preference that many people might feel, ifthey could not get gold, between country bank paper and bank of England paper.The very great issue of country bank paper during the years 1800 and 1801 wasevidently, therefore, in its origin rather a consequence than a cause of thehigh price of provisions; but being once absorbed into the circulation, it mustnecessarily affect the price of all commodities, and throw very great obstaclesin the way of returning cheapness.4[46_V__Of_the_English_poor_laws.html#id_1123] This is the great mischief of thesystem. During the scarcity itself, it is not to be doubted, that the increasedcirculation, by preventing the embarrassments which commerce and speculationmust otherwise have felt, enabled the country to continue all the branches ofits trade with less interruption, and to import a much greater quantity ofgrain, than it could have done otherwise; but to overbalance these temporaryadvantages, a lasting evil might be entailed upon the community, and the pricesof a time of scarcity might become permanent, from the difficulty ofre-absorbing this increased circulation.In this respect, however, it is much better that the great issue of paper shouldhave come from the country banks, than from the bank of England. During therestriction of payment in specie, there is no possibility of forcing the bank toretake its notes, when too abundant; but with regard to the country banks, assoon as their notes are not wanted in the circulation, they will be returned;and if the bank of England notes be not increased, which they probably will notbe, the whole circulating medium will thus be diminished.We may consider ourselves as peculiarly fortunate that the two years of scarcitywere succeeded by two events the best calculated to restore plenty and cheapness– an abundant harvest, and a peace; which, together, produced a generalconviction of plenty, in the minds both of buyers and sellers; and, by renderingthe first slow to purchase, and the others eager to sell, occasioned a glut inthe market, and a consequent rapid fall of price, which has enabled parishes totake off their allowances to the poor, and thus to prevent a return of highprices when the alarm among the sellers was over.If the two years of scarcity had been succeeded merely by years of averagecrops, I am strongly disposed to believe, that as no glut would have taken placein the market, the price of grain would have fallen only in an inconsiderabledegree, the parish allowances could not have been resumed, the increasedquantity of paper would still have been wanted, and the prices of allcommodities might by degrees have been regulated, permanently, according to theincreased circulating medium.If instead of giving the temporary assistance of parish allowances, which mightbe withdrawn on the first fall of price, we had raised universally the wages oflabour, it is evident, that the obstacles to a diminution of the circulation,and to returning cheapness, would have been still further increased; and thehigh price of labour would have become permanent, without any advantage whateverto the labourer.There is no one that more ardently desires to see a real advance in the price oflabour than myself; but the attempt to effect this object by forcibly raisingthe nominal price, which was practised to a certain degree, and recommendedalmost universally during the late scarcitics, every thinking man must reprobateas puerile and ineffectual.The price of labour, when left to find its natural level, is a most importantpolitical barometer, expressing the relation between the supply of provisions,and the demand for them; between the quantity to be consumed, and the number ofconsumers; and taken on the average, independently of accidental circumstances,it further expresses, clearly, the wants of the society respecting population;that is, whatever may be the number of children to a marriage necessary tomaintain exactly the present population, the price of labour will be justsufficient to support this number, or be above it, or below it, according to thestate of the real funds for the maintenance of labour, whether stationary,progressive, or retrograde. Instead, however, of considering it in this light,we consider it as something which we may raise or depress at pleasure, somethingwhich depends principally upon his majesty’s justices of the peace. When anadvance in the price of provisions already expresses that the demand is toogreat for the supply, in order to put the labourer in the same condition asbefore, we raise the price of labour, that is, we increase the demand, and arethen much surprised that the price of provisions continues rising. In this, weact much in the same manner, as if, when the quicksilver in the commonweather-glass stood at stormy, we were to raise it by some forcible pressure tosettled fair, and then be greatly astonished that it continued raining.Dr. Smith has clearly shewn, that the natural tendency of a year of scarcity,is, either to throw a number of labourers out of employment, or to oblige themto work for less than they did before, from the inability of masters to employthe same number at the same price. The raising of the price of wages tendsnecessarily to throw more out of employment, and completely to prevent the goodeffects which, he says, sometimes arise from a year of moderate scarcity, thatof making the lower classes of people do more work, and become more careful andindustrious. The number of servants out of place, and of manufacturers wantingemployment during the late scarcities, were melancholy proofs of the truth ofthese reasonings. If a general rise in the wages of labour had taken placeproportioned to the price of provisions, none but farmers and a few gentlemencould have afforded to employ the same number of workmen as before. Additionalcrowds of servants and manufacturers would have been turned off; and those whowere thus thrown out of employment, would, of course, have no other refuge thanthe parish. In the natural order of things, a scarcity must tend to lower,instead of to raise, the price of labour.After the publication, and general circulation of such a work as Dr. Smith’s, Iconfess, that it appears to me strange, that so many men who would yet aspire tobe thought political economists, should still think, that it is in the power ofthe justices of the peace, or even of the omnipotence of parliament, to alter bya fiat the whole circumstances of the country; and when the demand forprovisions is greater than the supply, by publishing a particular edict, to makethe supply at once equal to, or greater, than the demand. Many men who wouldshrink at the proposal of a maximum, would propose themselves, that the price oflabour should be proportioned to the price of provisions, and do not seem to beaware, that the two proposals are very nearly of the same nature, and that bothtend directly to famine. It matters not, whether we enable the labourer topurchase the same quantity of provisions which he did before, by fixing theirprice, or by raising in proportion the price of labour. The only advantage onthe side of raising the price of labour, is, that the rise in the price ofprovisions which necessarily follows it, encourages importation: but puttingimportation out of the question, which might possibly be prevented by war, orother circumstances, a universal rise of wages in proportion to the price ofprovisions, aided by adequate parish allowances to those who were thrown out ofwork, would, by preventing any kind of saving, in the same manner as a maximum,cause the whole crop to be consumed in nine months, which ought to have lastedtwelve, and thus produce a famine.As the inefficacy of poor laws, and of attempts forcibly to raise the price oflabour, are most conspicuous in a scarcity, I have thought myself justified inconsidering them under this view; and as these causes of increased pricereceived great additional force during the late scarcity from the increase ofthe circulating medium, I trust that the few observations which I have made onthis subject, will be considered as an allowable digression.NOTES1 [46_V__Of_the_English_poor_laws.html#id_1116]. Supposing the lower classes toearn on an average ten shillings a week, and the classes just above them,twenty, it is not to be doubted, that, in a scarcity, these latter would be morestraightened in their power of commanding the necessaries of life, by a donationof ten shillings a week to those below them, than by the subtraction of fiveshillings a week from their own earnings. In the one case, they would be allreduced to a level; the price of provisions would rise in an extraordinarymanner from the greatness of the competition; and all would be straightened forsubsistence. In the other case, the classes above the poor would still maintaina considerable part of their relative superiority; the price of provisions wouldby no means rise in the same degree; and their remaining fifteen shillings wouldpurchase much more than their twenty shillings in the former case.2 [46_V__Of_the_English_poor_laws.html#id_1118]. See a small pamphlet publishedin November 1800, entitled, An investigation of the cause of the present highprice of provisions. This pamphlet was mistaken by some for an inquiry into thecause of the scarcity, and as such, it would naturally appear to be incomplete,adverting, as it does, principally to a single cause. But the sole object of thepamphlet was, to give the principal reason for the extreme high price ofprovisions, in proportion to the degree of the scarcity, admitting thedeficiency of one fourth, as stated in the Duke of Portland’s letter, which, Iam much inclined to think, was very near the truth.3 [46_V__Of_the_English_poor_laws.html#id_1120]. A rise of wages, or of parishallowances, amounting to any particular sum, would occasion a much greaterdemand for the current circulating medium, than an increase of commercialtransactions to the same amount; because, in the first case, it is the commoncurrency alone which can be used; in the latter, much is done by the bills ofexchange, &c.; in the first also, much money is actually wanted, in proportionto the amount of the increased payments; in the latter, a little will go a greatway.4 [46_V__Of_the_English_poor_laws.html#id_1122]. It does not appear to me thatMr. Thornton in his valuable publication on paper credit, has taken sufficientnotice of the effects of the great paper issues of the country banks, in raisingthe price of commodities, and producing an unfavourable state of exchange withforeigners."},{"pageContent":"CHAP. VI.Subject of Poor Laws continued.INDEPENDENTLY of any considerations respecting a year of deficient crops, it isevident, that an increase of population, without a proportional increase offood, must lower the value of each man’s earnings. The food must nccessarily bedistributed in smaller quantities, and consequently, a day’s labour willpurchase a smaller quantity of provisions. An increase in the price ofprovisions will arise, either from an increase of population faster than themeans of subsistence, or from a different distribution of the money of thesociety. The food of a country which has been long peopled, if it be increasing,increases slowly and regularly, and cannot be made to answer any sudden demands;but variations in the distribution of the money of the society, are notunfrequently occurring, and are undoubtedly among the causes which occasion thecontinual variations in the prices of provisions.The poor laws of England tend to depress the general condition of the poor inthese two ways. Their first obvious tendency is to increase population withoutincreasing the food for its support. A poor man may marry with little or noprospect of being able to support a family without parish assistance. They maybe said, therefore, to create the poor which they maintain; and as theprovisions of the country must, in consequence of the increased population, bedistributed to every man in smaller proportions, it is evident, that the labourof those who are not supported by parish assistance, will purchase a smallerquantity of provisions than before, and consequently more of them must be drivento apply for assistance.Secondly, the quantity of provisions consumed in workhouses, upon a part of thesociety, that cannot in general be considered as the most valuable part,diminishes the shares that would otherwise belong to more industrious and moreworthy members, and thus, in the same manner, forces more to become dependent.If the poor in the workhouses were to live better than they do now, this newdistribution of the money of the society, would tend more conspicuously todepress the condition of those out of the workhouses by occasioning an advancein the price of provisions.Fortunately for England, a spirit of independence still remains among thepeasantry. The poor laws are strongly calculated to eradicate this spirit. Theyhave succeeded in part; but had they succeeded as completely as might have beenexpected, their pernicious tendency would not have been so long concealed.Hard as it may appear in individual instances, dependent poverty ought to beheld disgraceful. Such a stimulus seems to be absolutely necessary to promotethe happiness of the great mass of mankind; and every general attempt to weakenthis stimulus, however benevolent its apparent intention, will always defeat itsown purpose. If men be induced to marry from the mere prospect of parishprovision, they are not only unjustly tempted to bring unhappiness anddependence upon themselves and children, but they are tempted, without knowingit, to injure all in the same class with themselves.The parish laws of England appear to have contributed to raise the price ofprovisions, and to lower the real price of labour. They have thereforecontributed to impoverish that class of people whose only possession is theirlabour. It is also difficult to suppose, that they have not powerfullycontributed to generate that carelessness and want of frugality observable amongthe poor, so contrary to the disposition generally to be remarked among pettytradesmen and small farmers. The labouring poor, to use a vulgar expression,seem always to live from hand to mouth. Their present wants employ their wholeattention; and they seldom think of the future. Even when they have anopportunity of saving, they seldom exercise it; but all that they earn beyondtheir present necessities, goes, generally speaking, to the alehouse. The poorlaws may, therefore, be said to diminish both the power, and the will, to save,among the common people, and thus to weaken one of the strongest incentives tosobriety and industry, and consequently to happiness.It is a general complaint among master manufacturers that high wages ruin alltheir workmen; but it is difficult to conceive that these men would not save apart of their high wages for the future support of their families, instead ofspending it in drunkenness and dissipation, if they did not rely on parishassistance for support in case of accidents. And that the poor employed inmanufactures consider this assistance as a reason why they may spend all thewages which they earn, and enjoy themselves while they can, appears to beevident, from the number of families that, upon the failure of any greatmanufactory, immediately fall upon the parish; when, perhaps, the wages earnedin this manufactory while it flourished, were sufficiently above the price ofcommon country labour, to have allowed them to save enough for their support,till they could find some other channel for their industry.A man who might not be deterred from going to the alehouse, from theconsideration that, on his death, or sickness, he should leave his wife andfamily upon the parish, might yet hesitate in thus dissipating his earnings, ifhe were assured that, in either of these cases, his family must starve, or beleft to the support of casual bounty.The mass of happiness among the common people cannot but be diminished, when oneof the strongest checks to idleness and dissipation is thus removed; andpositive institutions, which render dependent poverty so general, weaken thatdisgrace, which for the best and most humane reasons ought to be attached to it.The poor laws of England were undoubtedly instituted for the most benevolentpurpose; but it is evident, that they have failed in attaining it. Theycertainly mitigate some cases of severe distress, which might otherwise occur,though the state of the poor who are supported by parishes, considered in allits circumstances, is very miserable. But one of the principal objections to thesystem, is, that for the assistance which some of the poor receive, in itselfalmost a doubtful blessing, the whole class of the common people of England issubjected to a set of grating, inconvenient, and tyrannical laws, totallyinconsistent with the genuine spirit of the constitution. The whole business ofsettlements, even in its present amended state, is contradictory to all ideas offreedom. The parish persecution of men whose families are likely to becomechargeable, and of poor women who are near lying-in, is a most disgraceful anddisgusting tyranny. And the obstructions continually occasioned in the market oflabour by these laws, have a constant tendency to add to the difficulties ofthose who are struggling to support themselves without assistance.These evils attendant on the poor laws seem to be irremediable. If assistance beto be distributed to a certain class of people, a power must be lodged somewhereof discriminating the proper objects, and of managing the concerns of theinstitutions that are necessary; but any great interference with the affairs ofother people, is a species of tyranny; and, in the common course of things, theexercise of this power may be expected to become grating to those who are drivento ask for support. The tyranny of justices, churchwardens, and overseers, is acommon complaint among the poor; but the fault does not lie so much in thesepersons, who, probably, before they were in power, were not worse than otherpeople, but in the nature of all such institutions.It will scarcely admit of a doubt, that if the poor laws had never existed inthis country, though there might have been a few more instances of very severedistress, the aggregate mass of happiness among the common people would havebeen much greater than it is at present.The radical defect of all systems of the kind, is, that of tending to increasepopulation, without increasing the means for its support, and, by thusdepressing the condition of those that are not relieved by parishes, to createmore poor. If, indeed, we examine some of our statutes, strictly, with referenceto the principle of population, we shall find that they attempt an absoluteimpossibility; and we cannot be surprised therefore, that they should constantlyfail in the attainment of their object.The famous 43d of Elizabeth, which has been so often referred to, and admired,enacts, that the overseers of the poor, “shall take order from time to time, byand with the consent of two or more justices, for setting to work the childrenof all such whose parents shall not, by the said persons, be thought able tokeep and maintain their children; and also such persons married or unmarried,as, having no means to maintain them, use no ordinary and daily trade of life toget their living by. And also to raise, weekly or otherwise, by taxation ofevery inhabitant, and every occupier of lands in the said parish, (in suchcompetent sums as they shall think fit,) a convenient stock of flax, hemp, wool,thread, iron, and other necessary ware and stuff, to set the poor to work.”What is this but saying, that the funds for the maintenance of labour in thiscountry may be increased at will, and without limit, by a fiat of government, oran assessment of the overseers. Strictly speaking, this clause is as arrogantand as absurd, as if it had enacted that two ears of wheat should in futuregrow, where one only had grown before. Canute, when he commanded the waves notto wet his princely foot, did not, in reality, assume a greater power over thelaws of nature. No directions are given to the overseers how to increase thefunds for the maintenance of labour; the necessity of industry, economy, andenlightened exertion, in the management of agricultural and commercial capitalis not insisted on, for this purpose; but it is expected, that a miraculousincrease of these funds should immediately follow an edict of the government,used at the discretion of some ignorant parish officers.If this clause were really, and bona fide, put in execution, and the shameattending the receiving of parish assistance worn off, every labouring man mightmarry as early as he pleased, under the certain prospect of having all hischildren properly provided for; and as, according to the supposition, therewould be no check to population from the consequences of poverty after marriage,the increase of people would be rapid beyond example in old states. After whathas been said in the former parts of this work, it is submitted to the reader,whether the utmost exertions of the most enlightened government could, in thiscase, make the food keep pace with the population, much less a mere arbitraryedict, the tendency of which is certainly rather to diminish than to increasethe funds for the maintenance of productive labour.In the actual circumstances of every country, the principle of population seemsto be always ready to exert nearly its full force; but, within the limit ofpossibility, there is nothing perhaps more improbable, or more out of the powerof any government to effect, than the direction of the industry of its subjectsin such a manner, as to produce the greatest quantity of human sustenance thatthe earth could bear. It evidently could not be done without the most completeviolation of the law of property, from which every thing that is valuable to manhas hitherto arisen. Such is the disposition to marry, particularly in veryyoung people, that, if the difficulties of providing for a family were entirelyremoved, very few would remain single at twenty-two. But what statesman, orrational government, could propose, that, all animal food should be prohibited,that no horses should be used for business or pleasure, that all the peopleshould live upon potatoes, and that the whole industry of the nation should beexerted in the production of them, except what was necessary for the merenecessaries of clothing and houses. Could such a revolution be effected, wouldit be desirable; particularly, as in a few years, notwithstanding all theseexertions, want, with less resource than ever, would inevitably recur.After a country has once ceased to be in the peculiar situation of a new colony,we shall always find, that, in the actual state of its cultivation, or in thatstate, which may rationally be expected from the most enlightened government,the increase of its food can never allow, for any length of time, anunrestricted increase of population; and therefore, the due execution of theclause in the 39th of Elizabeth, as a permanent law, is a physicalimpossibility.It will be said, perhaps, that the fact contradicts the theory, and that theclause in question has remained in force, and has been executed during the lasttwo hundred years. In answer to this, I should say without hesitation, that ithas not really been executed; and that it is merely owing to its incompleteexecution, that it remains on our statute book at present.The scanty relief granted to persons in distress, the capricious and insultingmanner in which it is sometimes distributed by the overseers, and the naturaland becoming pride not yet quite extinct among the peasantry of England, havedeterred the more thinking and virtuous part of them, from venturing onmarriage, without some better prospect of maintaining their families, than mereparish assistance. The desire of bettering our condition and the fear of makingit worse, like the vis medicatrix naturœ in physick, is the vis medicatrixreipubliœ in politicks, and is continually counteracting the disorders arisingfrom narrow human institutions. In spite of the prejudices in favour ofpopulation, and the direct encouragements to marriage from the poor laws, itoperates as a preventive check to increase; and happy for this country is itthat it does so.Those who are not deterred for a time from marriage, by considerations of thisnature, are either relieved very scantily at their own homes, where they sufferall the consequences arising from squalid poverty; or they are crowded togetherin close and unwholesome workhouses, where a great mortality almost universallytakes place, particularly among the young children. The dreadful account givenby Jonas Hanway of the treatment of parish children in London, is too well knownto need a comment; and it appears from Mr. Howlett, and other writers, that insome parts of the country they are not very much better off. A great part of theredundant population occasioned by the poor laws, is thus taken off by theoperation of the laws themselves, or at least by their ill execution. Theremaining part which survives, by causing the funds for the maintenance oflabour to be divided among a greater number than can be properly maintained bythem, and by turning a considerable share from the support of the diligent andcareful workman, to the support of the idle and the negligent, depresses thecondition of all those who are out of the workhouses, forces more every yearinto them, and has ultimately produced the enormous evil which we all so justlydeplore, that of the great and unnatural proportion of the people which is nowbecome dependent upon charity.If this be a just representation of the manner in which the clause in questionhas been executed, and of the effects which it has produced, it must be allowedthat we have practised an unpardonable deceit upon the poor, and have promisedwhat we have been very far from performing. It may be asserted, without dangerof exaggeration, that the poor laws have destroyed many more lives than theyhave preserved.The attempts to employ the poor on any great scale in manufactures have almostinvariably failed, and the stock and materials have been wasted. In those fewparishes which, by better management, or larger funds, have been enabled topersevere in this system, the effect of these new manufactures in the market,must have been, to throw out of employment many independent workmen who werebefore engaged in fabrications of a similar nature. This effect has been placedin a strong point of view by Daniel de Foe, in an address to parliament,entitled, Giving alms no charity. Speaking of the employment of parish childrenin manufactures, he says, For every skein of worsted these poor children spin,there must be a skein the less spun by some poor family that spin it before; andfor every piece of bays so made in London, there must be a piece the less madeat Colchester, or somewhere else.1[47_VI__Subject_of_poor_laws_continu.html#id_1127] Sir F. M. Eden, on the samesubject, observes, that whether mops and brooms are made by parish children, orby private workmen, no more can be sold than the publick is in want of.2[47_VI__Subject_of_poor_laws_continu.html#id_1125]It will be said, perhaps, that the same reasoning might be applied to any newcapital brought into competition in a particular trade or manufacture, which canrarely be done without injuring, in some degree, those that were engaged in itbefore. But there is a material difference in the two cases. In this, thecompetition is perfectly fair, and what every man, on entering into business,must lay his account to. He may rest secure that he shall not be supplanted,unless his competitor possess superior skill and industry. In the other case,the competition is supported by a great bounty, by which means, notwithstandingvery inferior skill and industry, on the part of his competitors, theindependent workman may be undersold, and unjustly excluded from the market. Hehimself, perhaps, is made to contribute to this competition against his ownearnings, and the funds for the maintenance of labour are thus turned, from thesupport of a trade which yields a proper profit, to one which cannot maintainitself without a bounty. It should be observed, in general, that when a fund forthe maintenance of labour is raised by assessment, the greatest part of it isnot a new capital brought into trade, but an old one, which before was much moreprofitably employed, turned into a new channel. The farmer pays to the poor’srates, for the encouragement of a bad and unprofitable manufacture, what hewould have employed on his land with infinitely more advantage to his country.In the one case, the funds for the maintenance of labour, are daily diminished;in the other, daily increased. And this obvious tendency of assessments for theemployment of the poor, to decrease the real funds for the maintenance of labourin any country, aggravates the absurdity of supposing that it is in the power ofa government to find employment for all its subjects, however fast they mayincrease.It is not intended that these reasonings should be applied against every mode ofemploying the poor on a limited scale, and with such restrictions, as might notencourage, at the same time, their increase. I would never wish to push generalprinciples too far, though I think that they ought always to be kept in view. Inparticular cases, the individual good to be obtained may be so great, and thegeneral evil so slight, that the former may clearly overbalance the latter.The intention is merely to shew, that the poor laws, as a general system, arefounded on a gross error; and that the common declamation on the subject of thepoor, which we see so often in print, and hear continually in conversation,namely, that the market price of labour ought always to be sufficient decentlyto support a family, and that employment ought to be found for all those who arewilling to work, is in effect to say, that the funds for the maintenance oflabour, in this country, are not only infinite, but might be made to increasewith such rapidity, that, supposing us to have at present six millions oflabourers, including their families, we might have 96 millions in anothercentury; or if these funds had been properly managed since the beginning of thereign of Edward I. supposing that there were then only two millions oflabourers, we might now have possessed above four million millions of labourers,or about four thousand times as many labourers as it has been calculated thatthere are people now on the face of the earth.NOTES1 [47_VI__Subject_of_poor_laws_continu.html#id_1126]. See extracts from Danielde Foe, in Sir F. M. Eden’s valuable work on the poor, vol. i. p. 261.2 [47_VI__Subject_of_poor_laws_continu.html#id_1124]. Sir F. Eden speaking ofthe supposed right of the poor to be supplied with employment while able towork, and with a maintenance when incapacitated from labour, very justlyremarks, “It may, however, be doubted, whether any right, the “gratification ofwhich seems to be impracticable, can be said to exist,” vol. i. p. 447. No manhas collected so many materials for forming a judgment on the effects of thepoor laws as Sir F. Eden, and the result he thus expresses. “Upon the “whole,therefore, there seems to be just grounds for concluding that the sum of “goodto be expected from a compulsory maintenance of the poor, will be far“outbalanced by the sum of evil which it will inevitably create,” vol. i. p.467. I am happy to have the sanction of so practical an inquirer to my opinionof the poor laws."},{"pageContent":"CHAP. VII.Of increasing Wealth as it affects the Condition of the Poor.THE professed object of Dr. Smith’s inquiry, is, the nature and causes of thewealth of nations. There is another, however, perhaps still more interesting,which he occasionally mixes with it, the causes which affect the happiness andcomfort of the lower orders of society, which is the most numerous class inevery nation. I am sufficiently aware of the near connexion of these twosubjects, and that, generally speaking, the causes which contribute to increasethe wealth of a state, tend also to increase the happiness of the lower classesof the people. But perhaps Dr. Smith has considered these two inquiries, asstill more nearly connected than they really are; at least, he has not stoppedto take notice of those instances, where the wealth of a society may increase,according to his definition of wealth, without having any tendency to increasethe comforts of the labouring part of it.I do not mean to enter into any philosophical discussion of what constitutes theproper happiness of man, but shall merely consider two universally acknowledgedingredients, the command of the necessaries and comforts of life, and thepossession of health.The comforts of the labouring poor must necessarily depend upon the fundsdestined for the maintenance of labour; and will generally be in proportion tothe rapidity of their increase. The demand for labour, which such increaseoccasions, will of course raise the value of labour; and till the additionalnumber of hands required are reared, the increased funds will be distributed tothe same number of persons as before, and therefore, every labourer will livecomparatively at his ease. The error of Dr. Smith lies in representing everyincrease of the revenue or stock of a society, as an increase of these funds.Such surplus stock or revenue, will indeed always be considered by theindividual possessing it, as an additional fund from which he may maintain morelabour: but it will not be a real and effectual fund for the maintenance of anadditional number of labourers, unless the whole, or at least a great part ofit, be convertible into a proportional quantity of provisions; and it will notbe so convertible where the increase has arisen merely from the produce oflabour, and not from the produce of land. A distinction will in this case occurbetween the number of hands which the stock of the society could employ, and thenumber which its territory can maintain.Dr. Smith defines the wealth of a state to be, the annual produce of its landand labour. This definition evidently includes manufactured produce, as well asthe produce of the land. Now, supposing a nation, for a course of years, to addwhat it saved from its yearly revenue to its manufacturing capital solely, andnot to its capital employed upon land, it is evident that it might grow richeraccording to the above definition, without a power of supporting a greaternumber of labourers, and therefore, without any increase in the real funds forthe maintenance of labour. There would, notwithstanding, be a demand for labour,from the power that each manufacturer would possess, or at least think hepossessed, of extending his old stock in trade, or of setting up fresh works.This demand, would of course raise the price of labour; but if the yearly stockof provisions in the country were not increasing, this rise would soon turn outto be merely nominal, as the price of provisions must necessarily rise with it.The demand for manufacturing labourers might, indeed, entice many fromagriculture, and thus tend to diminish the annual produce of the land; but wewill suppose any effects of this kind to be compensated by improvements in theinstruments, or mode, of agriculture, and the quantity of provisions thereforeto remain the same. Improvements in manufacturing machinery would of course takeplace; and this circumstance, added to the greater number of hands employed inmanufactures, would augment considerably the annual produce of the labour of thecountry. The wealth, therefore, of the country would be increasing annually,according to the definition, and might not be increasing very slowly.The question is, how far, wealth, increasing in this way, has a tendency tobetter the condition of the labouring poor. It is a self-evident propositionthat any general advance in the price of labour, the stock of provisionsremaining the same, can only be a nominal advance, as it must shortly befollowed by a proportional rise in provisions. The increase in the price oflabour which we have supposed, would have no permanent effect therefore ingiving to the labouring poor a greater command over the necessaries of life. Inthis respect, they would be nearly in the same state as before. In some otherrespects, they would be in a worse state. A greater proportion of them would beemployed in manufactures, and fewer consequently in agriculture. And thisexchange of professions will be allowed, I think, by all to be veryunfavourable, in respect of health, one essential ingredient of happiness, andalso with regard to the greater uncertainty of manufacturing labour, arisingfrom the capricious taste of man, the accidents of war, and other causes, whichoccasionally produce very severe distress among the lower classes of society. Onthe state of the poor employed in manufactories, with respect to health andother circumstances which affect their happiness, I will beg leave to quote apassage from Dr. Aikin’s description of the country round Manchester.“The invention and improvements of machines to shorten labour, have had asurprising influence to extend our trade, and also to call in hands from allparts, especially children for the cotton mills. It is the wise plan ofProvidence, that in this life there shall be no good without its attendantinconvenience. There are many which are too obvious in these cotton mills andsimilar factories, which counteract that increase of population usuallyconsequent on the improved facility of labour. In these, children of very tenderage are employed, many of them collected from the workhouses in London andWestminster, and transported in crowds, as apprentices to masters resident manyhundred miles distant, where they serve unknown, unprotected, and forgotten bythose to whose care, nature, or the laws, had consigned them. These children areusually too long confined to work in close rooms, often during the whole night.The air they breathe from the oil, &c. employed in the machinery, and othercircumstances, is injurious; little attention is paid to their cleanliness; andfrequent changes from a warm and dense, to a cold and thin atmosphere, arepredisposing causes to sickness and disability, and particularly to theepidemick fever which is so generally to be met with in these factories. It isalso much to be questioned, if society does not receive detriment, from themanner in which children are thus employed during their early years. They arenot generally strong to labour, or capable of pursuing any other branch ofbusiness when the term of their apprenticeship expires. The females are whollyuninstructed in sowing, knitting, and other domestick affairs, requisite to makethem notable, and frugal wives and mothers. This is a very great misfortune tothem and the publick, as is sadly proved by a comparison of the families oflabourers in husbandry, and those of manufacturers in general. In the former wemeet with neatness, cleanliness and comfort; in the latter, with filth, rags,and poverty, although their wages may be nearly double to those of thehusbandman. It must be added that the want of early religious instruction andexample, and the numerous and indiscriminate association in these buildings, arevery unfavourable to their future conduct in life.1[48_VII__Of_increasing_wealth_as_it.html#id_1129]”In addition to the evils mentioned in this passage, we all know how subjectparticular manufactures are to fail, from the caprice of taste, or the accidentof war. The weavers of Spitalfields were plunged into the most severe distressby the fashion of muslins instead of silks; and numbers of the workmen inSheffield and Birmingham were, for a time, thrown out of employment, from theadoption of shoe-strings and covered buttons, instead of buckles and metalbuttons. Our manufactures, taken in the mass, have increased with greatrapidity, but, in particular places, they have failed, and the parishes, wherethis has happened, are invariably loaded with a crowd of poor, in the mostdistressed and miserable condition. In the work of Dr. Aikin just alluded to, itappears that the register for the collegiate church at Manchester, fromChristmas 1793 to Christmas 1794, stated a decrease of 168 marriages, 538christenings, and 250 burials. And in the parish of Rochdale, in theneighbourhood, a still more melancholy reduction, in proportion to the number ofpeople, took place. In 1792, the births were 746, the burials 646, and themarriages 339. In 1794, the births were 373, the burials 671, and the marriages199. The cause of this sudden check to population, was the commencement of thewar, and the failure of commercial credit, which occurred about this time; andsuch a check could not have taken place, in so sudden a manner, without beingoccasioned by the most severe distress.Under such circumstances of situation, unless the increase of the riches of acountry from manufactures, give the lower classes of the society, on an average,a decidedly greater command over the necessaries and conveniencies of life, itwill not appear that their condition is improved.It will be said, perhaps, that the advance in the price of provisions willimmediately turn some additional capital into the channel of agriculture, andthus occasion a much greater produce. But from experience, it appears, that thisis an effect which takes place very slowly, particularly when, as in the presentinstance, an advance in the price of labour had preceded the advance in theprice of provisions, and would therefore tend to impede the good effects uponagriculture, which the increased value of the produce of land might otherwisehave occasioned.It may also be said, that the additional capital of the nation would enable itto import provisions, sufficient for the maintenance of those whom its stockcould employ. A small country, with a large navy, and great accommodations forinland carriage, may indeed import and distribute an effectual quantity ofprovisions: but in large landed nations, if they may be so called, animportation adequate at all times to the demand, is scarcely possible. It seemsin great measure to have escaped attention, that a nation, which, from itsextent of territory and population, must necessarily support the greater part ofits people on the produce of its own soil; but which yet, on average years,draws a small portion of its corn from abroad, is in a much more precarioussituation with regard to the constancy of its supplies, than such states as drawalmost the whole of their provisions from other countries. The demands ofHolland and Hamburgh may be known with considerable accuracy by those who supplythem. If they increase, they increase gradually, and are not subject, from yearto year, to any great and sudden variations. But it is otherwise with such acountry as England. Supposing it, in average years, to want about four hundredthousand quarters of wheat. Such a demand will of course be very easilysupplied. But a year of deficient crops occurs, and the demand is suddenly twomillions of quarters. If the demand had been, on an average, two millions, itmight perhaps have been adequately supplied, from the extended agriculture ofthose countries which are in the habit of exporting corn: but we cannot expectthat it can easily be answered thus suddenly; and indeed, we know fromexperience, that an unusual demand of this nature, in a nation capable of payingfor it, cannot exist, without raising the price of wheat very considerably inall the ports of Europe. Hamburgh, Holland, and the ports of the Baltic, feltvery sensibly the high prices of England during the late scarcity; and I havebeen informed from very good authority, that the price of bread in New York waslittle inferior to the highest price in London.A nation, possessed of a large territory, is unavoidably subject to thisuncertainty in its means of subsistence, when the commercial part of itspopulation is either equal to, or has increased beyond, the surplus produce ofits cultivators. No reserve being, in these cases, left in exportation, the fulleffect of every deficiency from unfavourable seasons must necessarily be felt;and though the riches of such a country may enable it, for a certain period, tocontinue raising the nominal price of wages, so as to give the lower classes ofthe society a power of purchasing imported corn at a high price; yet, as asudden demand can very seldom be fully answered, the competition in the marketwill invariably raise the price of provisions, in full proportion to the advancein the price of labour; the lower classes will be but little relieved; and thedearth will operate severely throughout all the ranks of society.According to the natural order of things, years of scarcity must occasionallyrecur, in all landed nations. They ought always therefore to enter into ourconsideration; and the prosperity of any country may justly be considered asprecarious, in which the funds for the maintenance of labour are liable to greatand sudden fluctuations, from every unfavourable variation in the seasons.But putting, for the present, years of scarcity out of the question; when thecommercial population of any country increases so much beyond the surplusproduce of the cultivators, that the demand for imported corn is not easilysupplied, and the price rises in proportion to the price of wages, no furtherincrease of riches will have any tendency to give the labourer a greater commandover the necessaries of life. In the progress of wealth, this will naturallytake place; either from the largeness of the supply wanted; the increaseddistance from which it is brought, and consequently the increased expence ofimportation; the greater consumption of it in the countries in which it isusually purchased; or what must unavoidably happen, the necessity of a greaterdistance of inland carriage, in these countries. Such a nation, by increasingindustry, and increasing ingenuity in the improvement of machinery, may still goon increasing the yearly quantity of its manufactured produce; but its funds forthe maintenance of labour, and consequently its population, will be perfectlystationary. This point is the natural limit to the population of all commercialstates.2 [48_VII__Of_increasing_wealth_as_it.html#id_1131]That every increase of the stock or revenue of a nation cannot be considered asan increase of the real funds for the maintenance of labour, and therefore,cannot have the same good effect upon the condition of the poor, will appear ina strong light, if the argument be applied to China.Dr. Smith observes, that China has probably long been as rich as the nature ofher laws and institutions will admit; but that, with other laws andinstitutions, and if foreign commerce were held in honour, she might still bemuch richer. The question is, would such an increase of wealth, be an increaseof the real funds for the maintenance of labour, and consequently tend to placethe lower classes of people in China in a state of greater plenty?If trade and foreign commerce were held in great honour in China, it is evident,that, from the great number of labourers, and the cheapness of labour, she mightwork up manufactures for foreign sale to an immense amount. It is equallyevident, that, from the great bulk of provisions, and the amazing extent of herinland territory, she could not in return import such a quantity, as would beany sensible addition to the annual stock of subsistence in the country. Herimmense amount of manufactures, therefore, she would exchange chiefly forluxuries collected from all parts of the world. At present it appears, that nolabour whatever is spared in the production of food. The country is ratheroverpeopled in proportion to what its stock can employ, and labour is thereforeso abundant, that no pains are taken to abridge it. The consequence of this isprobably the greatest production of food that the soil can possibly afford; forit will be generally observed, that processes for abridging labour, though theymay enable a farmer to bring a certain quantity of grain cheaper to market, tendrather to diminish than increase the whole produce. An immense capital could notbe employed in China in preparing manufactures for foreign trade, without takingoff so many labourers from agriculture, as to alter this state of things, and,in some degree, to diminish the produce of the country. The demand formanufacturing labourers would naturally raise the price of labour; but as thequantity of subsistence would not be increased, the price of provisions wouldkeep pace with it, or even more than keep pace with it, if the quantity ofprovisions were really decreasing. The country would, however, be evidentlyadvancing in wealth; the exchangeable value of the annual produce of its landand labour would be annually augmented; yet the real funds for the maintenanceof labour would be stationary, or even declining; and consequently theincreasing wealth of the nation would tend rather to depress than to raise thecondition of the poor.3 [48_VII__Of_increasing_wealth_as_it.html#id_1133] Withregard to the command over the necessaries of life, they would be in the same,or rather worse state, than before; and a great part of them would haveexchanged the healthy labours of agriculture for the unhealthy occupations ofmanufacturing industry.The argument, perhaps, appears clearer when applied to China, because it isgenerally allowed, that its wealth has been long stationary, and its soilcultivated nearly to the utmost. With regard to any other country, it mightalways be a matter of dispute, at which of the two periods compared, wealth wasincreasing the fastest, as it is upon the rapidity of the increase of wealth, atany particular period, that, Dr. Smith says, the condition of the poor depends.It is evident, however, that two nations might increase exactly with the samerapidity in the exchangeable value of the annual produce of their land andlabour; yet, if one had applied itself chiefly to agriculture, and the otherchiefly to commerce, the funds for the maintenance of labour, and consequentlythe effect of the increase of wealth in each nation, would be extremelydifferent. In that, which had applied itself chiefly to agriculture, the poorwould live in greater plenty, and population would rapidly increase. In that,which had applied itself chiefly to commerce, the poor would be comparativelybut little benefited, and consequently, population would either be stationary,or increase very slowly.NOTES1 [48_VII__Of_increasing_wealth_as_it.html#id_1128]. P. 219. Endeavours havebeen made, Dr. Aikin says, to remedy these evils, and in some factories theyhave been attended with success. An act of parliament has of late also passed onthis subject, from which it is hoped, that much good will result.2 [48_VII__Of_increasing_wealth_as_it.html#id_1130]. Sir James Steuart’sPolitical Œconomy, vol. i. b. i. c. xviii. p. 119.3 [48_VII__Of_increasing_wealth_as_it.html#id_1132]. The condition of the poorin China is, indeed, very miserable at present; but this is not owing to theirwant of foreign commerce, but to their extreme tendency to marriage andincrease; and if this tendency were to continue the same, the only way in whichthe introduction of a greater number of manufacturers could possibly make thelower classes of people richer, would be, by increasing the mortality amongstthem, which is certainly not a very desirable mode of growing rich."},{"pageContent":"CHAP. VIII.Of the Definitions of Wealth. Agricultural and Commercial Systems.A QUESTION seems naturally to arise here, whether the exchangeable value of theannual produce of the land and labour, is the proper definition of the wealth ofa country, or whether merely the produce of land, according to the FrenchEconomists, may not be a more correct definition. Certain it is, that everyincrease of wealth, according to this definition, will be an increase of thefunds for the maintenance of labour, and consequently will always tend toameliorate the condition of the labouring poor, and increase population; thoughan increase of wealth, according to Dr. Smith’s definition, will by no meansinvariably have the same tendency. And yet it may not follow, from thisconsideration, that Dr. Smith’s definition is false.The Economists consider all labour employed in manufactures as unproductive; andin endeavouring to disprove this position, Dr. Smith has been accused of arguingobscurely and inconclusively. He appears to me, however, only incorrect inapplying his own definition to try the reasoning, by which the Economistssupport theirs; when, in fact, the question was, respecting the truth orfalsehood of the definitions themselves; and, of course, one could not beapplied as a test to the other. Nothing can be more clear than that manufacturesincrease the wealth of a state according to Dr. Smith’s definition; and it isequally clear, that they do not increase it, according to the definition of theEconomists. The question of the productiveness or unproductiveness ofmanufactures, is allowed by the Economists to be a question respecting netproduce; and the determination of this question either way, would not affect Dr.Smith’s definition, which includes produce of every kind, whether net, orotherwise. And in the same manner, the proof of a net produce arising toindividuals from manufactures, would not really invalidate the definition of theEconomists, though they have laid themselves open to objections from thisquarter, by the manner in which they have defended their position.They say, that labour employed upon land is productive, because the produce,over and above completely paying the labourer and the farmer, affords a clearrent to the landlord; and that the labour employed upon a piece of lace isunproductive, because it merely replaces the provisions that the workman hadconsumed while making it, and the stock of his employer, without affording anyclear rent whatever. But supposing the value of the wrought lace to be such, asthat besides paying in the most complete manner, the workman and his employer,it could afford a clear rent to a third person, the state of the case would notreally be altered. Though, according to this mode of reasoning, the man employedin the manufacture of lace, would, upon the present supposition, appear to be aproductive labourer; yet, according to their definition of the wealth of astate, he ought not to be considered in that light. He will have added nothingto the produce of the land. He has consumed a portion of this produce, and hasleft a piece of lace in return; and though he may sell this piece of lace forthree times the quantity of provisions which he consumed while he was making it,and thus be a very productive labourer with regard to himself; yet he has addednothing by his labour to the essential wealth of the state.Suppose, that two hundred thousand men, who are now employed in producingmanufactures, that only tend to gratify the vanity of a few rich people, were tobe employed on some barren uncultivated land, and to produce only half of thequantity of food that they themselves consumed, they might still be considered,in some respects, as more productive labourers than they were before. In theirformer employment, they consumed a certain portion of the food of the country,and left in return some silks and laces. In their latter employment, theyconsumed the same quantity of food, and left in return, provision for a hundredthousand men. There can be little doubt which of the two legacies would be themost really beneficial to the country, and which, according to the definition ofthe Economists, would add the most to the wealth of the state.A capital employed upon land may be unproductive to the individual that employsit, and yet be productive to the society. A capital employed in trade, on thecontrary, may be highly productive to the individual, and yet be almost totallyunproductive to the society. It is indeed impossible to see the great fortunesthat are made in commerce, and, at the same time, the liberality with which somany merchants live, and yet agree in the statement of the Economists, thatmanufacturers can only grow rich by depriving themselves of the funds destinedfor their support. In many branches of trade the profits are so great, as wouldallow of a clear rent to a third person; but as there is no third person in thecase, and all the profits centre in the merchant or master manufacturer, heseems to have a fair chance of growing rich without much privation, and weconsequently see large fortunes acquired in trade by persons who have not beenremarked for their parsimony.These fortunes, however, by which individuals are greatly enriched, do notenrich proportionally the whole society, and, in some respects, have even acontrary tendency. The home trade of consumption is by far the most importanttrade of every nation. Putting then, for a moment, foreign trade out of thequestion, the man who, by an ingenious manufacture, obtains a double portion outof the old stock of provisions, will certainly not be so useful to the state, asthe man, who, by his labour, adds a single share to the former stock. And thisview of the subject, shews that manufactures are essentially different from theproduce of the land, and that the question respecting their productiveness, orunproductiveness, by no means depends entirely upon the Iargeness of the profitsupon them, or upon their yielding or not yielding a clear rent. If theEconomists would allow, which, from the manner in which they express themselves,they might be sometimes supposed to do, that the value yielded by manufacturerswas of the same nature as the produce of the land, though it were allowed to beonly accurately equal to the value of their consumption, they certainly couldnot maintain the position that land is the only source of wealth. A marriagewhich produces two children, though it contain in itself no principle ofincrease, yet it adds to the sum of the actual population, which would have beenless by two persons, if the marriage had been really barren. But the fact is,that though the language of the Economists has fairly warranted thisillustration, which Dr. Smith gives; yet the illustration itself is incorrect.In the case of the marriage, the two children are really a new production, acompletely new creation. But manufactures, strictly speaking, are no newproduction, no new creation, but merely a modification of an old one, and whensold must be paid for out of a revenue already in existence, and consequentlythe gain of the seller is the loss of the buyer. A revenue is transferred, butnot created.If, in asserting the productiveness, of the labour employed upon land, we lookonly to the clear monied rent yielded to a certain number of proprietors, weundoubtedly consider the subject in a very contracted point of view. Thequantity of the surplus produce of the cultivators is, indeed, measured by thisclear rent; but its real value consists in its capability of supporting acertain number of people, or millions of people, according to its extent, allexempted from the labour of procuring their own food, and who may, therefore,either live without manual exertions, or employ themselves in modifying the rawproduce of nature into the forms best suited to the gratification of man.A net monied revenue, arising from manufactures, of the same extent, and to thesame number of individuals, would by no means be accompanied by the samecircumstances. It would throw the country in which it existed into an absolutedependence upon the surplus produce of others; and if this foreign revenue couldnot be obtained, the clear monied rent, which we have supposed, would beabsolutely of no value to the nation.As manufactures are not a new production, but the modification of an old one,the most natural and obvious way of estimating them, is by the labour which thismodification costs. At the same time, it may be doubted, whether we can saypositively, that the price of this labour, added to the price of the rawmaterial, is exactly their real value. The ultimate value of every thing,according to the general reasoning of the Economists, consists in being propre ala jouissance. In this view, some manufactures are of very high value; and ingeneral, they may be said to be worth to the purchaser what that purchaser willconsent to give. In the actual state of things, from monopolies, from superiormachinery, or other causes, they are generally sold a price above what theEconomists consider as their real worth; and with regard to a mere moniedrevenue to an individual, there is no apparent difference, between a manufacturewhich yields very large profits, and a piece of land which is farmed by theproprietor.1 [49_VIII__Of_the_definitions_of_weal.html#id_1135]Land, in an enlarged view of the subject, is incontrovertibly the sole source ofall riches; but when we take individuals or particular nations into our view,the state of the question is altered, as both nations and individuals may beenriched by a transfer of revenue, without the creation of a new one.There are none of the definitions of the wealth of a state that are not liableto some objections. If we take the gross produce of the land, it is evident thatthe funds for the maintenance of labour, the population, and the wealth, mayincrease very rapidly, while the nation is apparently poor, and has very littledisposeable revenue. If we take Dr. Smith’s definition, wealth may increase ashas before been shewn, without tending to increase the funds for the maintenanceof labour and the population. If we take the clear surplus produce of the land,according to most of the Economists; in this case, the funds for the maintenanceof labour and the population may increase, without an increase of wealth, as inthe instance of the cultivation of new lands, which will pay a profit but not arent; and, vice versa, wealth may increase, without increasing the funds for themaintenance of labour, and the population, as in the instance of improvements inagricultural instruments, and in the mode of agriculture, which may make theland yield the same produce, with fewer persons employed upon it; andconsequently the disposeable wealth, or revenue, would be increased, without apower of supporting a greater number of people.The objections, however, to the two last definitions do not prove that they areincorrect; but merely that an increase of wealth, though generally, is notnecessarily and invariably accompanied by an increase of the funds for themaintenance of labour; and consequently, by the power of supporting a greaternumber of people, or of enabling the former number to live in greater plenty andhappiness.Whichever of these two definitions is adopted, as the best criterion of thewealth, power, and prosperity of a state, the great position of the Economistswill always remain true, that the surplus produce of the cultivators is thegreat fund which ultimately pays all those who are not employed upon the land.Throughout the whole world, the number of manufacturers, of proprietors, and ofpersons engaged in the various civil and military professions, must be exactlyproportioned to this surplus produce, and cannot in the nature of thingsincrease beyond it. If the earth had been so niggardly of her produce as tooblige all her inhabitants to labour for it, no manufacturers or idle personscould ever have existed. But her first intercourse with man was a voluntarypresent; not very large indeed, but sufficient as a fund for his subsistence,till by the proper exercise of his faculties he could procure a greater. Inproportion as the labour and ingenuity of man, exercised upon the land, haveincreased this surplus produce, leisure has been given to a greater number ofpersons to employ themselves in all the inventions which embellish civilizedlife. And though, in its turn, the desire to profit by these inventions, hasgreatly contributed to stimulate the cultivators to increase their surplusproduce; yet the order of precedence is clearly the surplus produce; because thefunds for the subsistence of the manufacturer must be advanced to him, before hecan complete his work: and if we were to imagine that we could command thissurplus produce, whenever we willed it, by forcing manufactures, we should bequickly admonished of our gross error, by the inadequate support which theworkman would receive, in spite of any rise that might take place in his nominalwages.According to the system of the Economists, manufactures are an object on whichrevenue is spent, and not any part of the revenue itself.2[49_VIII__Of_the_definitions_of_weal.html#id_1139] But though from thisdescription of manufactures, and the epithet sterile sometimes applied to them,they seem rather to be degraded by the terms of the Economists, it is a verygreat error to suppose that their system is really unfavourable to them. On thecontrary, I am disposed to believe, that it is the only system by which commerceand manufactures can prevail to a very great extent, without bringing with them,at the same time, the seeds of their own ruin. Before the late revolution inHolland, the high price of the necessaries of life had destroyed many of itsmanufactures.3 [49_VIII__Of_the_definitions_of_weal.html#id_1137] Monopolies arealways subject to be broken; and even the advantage of capital and machinery,which may yield extraordinary profits for a time, is liable to be greatlylessened by the competition of other nations. In the history of the world, thenations, whose wealth has been derived principally from manufactures andcommerce, have been perfectly ephemeral beings, compared with those, the basisof whose wealth has been agriculture. It is in the nature of things, that astate which subsists upon a revenue furnished by other countries, must beinfinitely more exposed to all the accidents of time and chance, than one whichproduces its own.No error is more frequent, than that of mistaking effects for causes. We are soblinded by the shewiness of commerce and manufactures, as to believe that theyare almost the sole cause of the wealth, power, and prosperity of England. Butperhaps, they may be more justly considered as the consequences, than the causeof this wealth. According to the definition of the Economists, which considersonly the produce of land, England is the richest country in Europe in proportionto her size. Her system of agriculture is beyond comparison better, andconsequently her surplus produce is more considerable. France is very greatlysuperior to England in extent of territory and population; but when the surplusproduce, or disposeable revenue of the two nations are compared, the superiorityof France almost vanishes. And it is this great surplus produce in England,arising from her agriculture, which enables her to support such a vast body ofmanufactures, such formidable fleets and armies, such a crowd of persons engagedin the liberal professions, and a proportion of the society living on moneyrents, very far beyond what has ever been known in any other country of theworld. According to the returns lately made of the population of England andWales, it appears that the number of persons employed in agriculture, isconsiderably less than a fifth part of the whole. There is reason to believethat the classifications in these returns are incorrect; but making very greatallowances for errors of this nature, it can scarcely admit of a doubt, that thenumber of persons employed in agriculture is very unusually small in proportionto the actual produce. Of late years indeed, the part of the society, notconnected with agriculture, has unfortunately increased beyond this produce; butthe average importation of corn, as yet, bears but a small proportion to thatwhich is grown in the country, and consequently the power which Englandpossesses of supporting so vast a body of idle consumers must be attributedprincipally to the greatness of her surplus produce.It will be said that it was her commerce and manufactures which encouraged hercultivators to obtain this great surplus produce, and therefore indirectly, ifnot directly, created it. That commerce and manufactures produce this effect ina certain degree, is true; but that they sometimes produce a contrary effect,and generally so, when carried to excess, is equally true. Undoubtedlyagriculture cannot flourish without a vent for its commodities, either at homeor abroad; but when this want has been adequately supplied, the interests ofagriculture demand nothing more. When too great a part of a nation is engaged incommerce and manufactures, it is a clear proof, that, either from undueencouragement, or from other particular causes, a capital is employed in thisway to much greater advantage than on land; and under such circumstances, it isimpossible, that the land should not be robbed of much of the capital whichwould naturally have fallen to its share. Dr. Smith justly observes, that thenavigation act, and the monopoly of the colony trade, necessarily forced into aparticular and not very advantageous channel, a greater proportion of thecapital of Great Britain than would otherwise have gone to it; and by thustaking capital from other employments, and at the same time universally raisingthe rate of British mercantile profit, discouraged the improvement of the land.4[49_VIII__Of_the_definitions_of_weal.html#id_1141] If the improvement of land,he goes on to say, affords a greater capital than what can be drawn from anequal capital in any mercantile employment, the land will draw capital frommercantile employments. If the profit be less, mercantile employments will drawcapital from the improvement of land. The monopoly, therefore, by raising therate of British mercantile profit, and thus discouraging agriculturalimprovement, has necessarily retarded the natural increase of a great originalsource of revenue, the rent of land.5[49_VIII__Of_the_definitions_of_weal.html#id_1145]The East and West Indies, are indeed so great an object, and afford employmentwith high profits, to so great a capital, that it is impossible that they shouldnot draw capital from other employments, and particularly from the cultivationof the soil, the profits upon which, in general, are unfortunately very small.All corporations, patents, and exclusive privileges of every kind, which aboundso much in the mercantile system, have in proportion to their extent the sameeffect. And the experience of the last twenty years seems to warrant us inconcluding, that the high price of provisions arising from the abundance ofcommercial wealth, accompanied, as it has been, by very great variations, and bya great rise, in the price of labour, does not operate as an encouragement toagriculture, sufficient to make it keep pace with the rapid strides of commerce.It will be said, perhaps, that land is always improved by the redundancy ofcommercial capital. But this effect is late and slow, and in the nature ofthings cannot take place till this capital is really redundant, which it neveris, while the interest of money and the profits of mercantile stock are high. Wecannot look forwards to any considerable effect of this kind till the interestof money sinks to 3 per cent. When men can get 5 or 6 per cent. for their money,without any trouble, they will hardly venture a capital upon land, where,including risks, and the profits upon their own labour and attendance, they maynot get much more. Wars and loans, as far as internal circumstances areconcerned, impede but little the progress of those branches of commerce wherethe profits of stock are high; but affect very considerably the increase of thatmore essential and permanent source of wealth, the improvement of the land. Itis in this point, I am inclined to believe, that the national debt of Englandhas been most injurious to her. By absorbing the redundancy of commercialcapital, and keeping up the rate of interest, it has prevented this capital fromoverflowing upon the soil. And a large mortgage6[49_VIII__Of_the_definitions_of_weal.html#id_1143] has thus been established onthe lands of England, the interest of which is drawn from the payment ofproductive labour, and dedicated to the support of idle consumers.It must be allowed, therefore, upon the whole, that our commerce has not donemuch for our agriculture; but that our agriculture has done a great deal for ourcommerce; and that the improved system of cultivation which has taken place, inspite of considerable discouragements, creates yearly a surplus produce, whichenables the country, with but little assistance, to support so vast a body ofpeople engaged in pursuits unconnected with the land.NOTES1 [49_VIII__Of_the_definitions_of_weal.html#id_1134]. I do not mean to say thatthe Economists do not fully comprehend the true distinction between the labouremployed upon land, and the labour employed in manufactures, and reallyunderstand the value of the surplus produce of the cultivators, as totallydistinct from the net monied revenue which it yields; but it appears to me thatthey have exposed themselves to be misunderstood, in their reasonings respectingthe productiveness of land, and the unproductiveness of manufactures, bydwelling too much on the circumstance of a net rent to individuals. In anenlarged sense, it is certainly true, that land is the only source of net rent.2 [49_VIII__Of_the_definitions_of_weal.html#id_1138]. Even upon this system,there is one point of view, in which manufactures appear greatly to add to theriches of a state. The use of a revenue, according to the Economists, is to bespent; and a great part of it will of course be spent in manufactures. But if bythe judicious employment of manufacturing capital, these commodities growconsiderably cheaper, the surplus produce becomes proportionably of so muchgreater value, and the real revenue of the nation is virtually increased. Thereis no light, perhaps, in which we can view manufactures, where they appear to beso productive as in this; and if it do not completely justify Dr. Smith incalling manufacturing labour productive in the strict sense of that term; itfully warrants all the pains he has taken in explaining the nature and effectsof commercial capital, and of the division of manufacturing labour.3 [49_VIII__Of_the_definitions_of_weal.html#id_1136]. Smith’s Wealth of Nations,vol. iii, b. v. c. ii. p. 392.4 [49_VIII__Of_the_definitions_of_weal.html#id_1140]. Wealth of Nations, vol.ii. b. iv. c. vii. p. 435.5 [49_VIII__Of_the_definitions_of_weal.html#id_1144]. Id. p. 436.6 [49_VIII__Of_the_definitions_of_weal.html#id_1142]. One of the principalerrors of the French Economists appears to be on the subject of taxation.Admitting, as I shall be disposed to do, that the surplus produce of the land isthe fund which pays every thing besides the food of the cultivators; yet itseems to be a mistake to suppose, that the owners of land are the soleproprietors of this surplus produce. It appears to me, that every man who hasrealized a capital in money, on which he can live without labour, has virtuallya mortgage on the land for a certain portion of the surplus produce. Thismortgage may not indeed be so well secured, as those which usually bear thistitle, or as the money rent of the land-owner; but while the power of obtainingthis monied interest remains, its effect, or command over the surplus produce,is exactly the same. The landholders, therefore, are not the sole proprietors ofsurplus produce; and their joint proprietors, those who live upon the interestof money, certainly pay a general tax in the same manner as the landholders, andcannot throw it off from their shoulders, like those who live upon the profitsof stock, or the wages of labour. Practically, indeed, it cannot be doubted thateven the profits of stock and the wages of labour, particularly of professionallabour, pay some taxes on necessaries, and many on luxuries, for a veryconsiderable time. The real surplus produce of this country, or all the producenot actually consumed by the cultivators, is a very different thing, and shouldcarefully be distinguished from the sum of the net rents of the landlords. Thissum, it is supposed, does not much exceed a fifth part of the gross produce. Theremaining four fifths, is certainly not consumed by the labourers and horsesemployed in agriculture; but a very considerable portion of it is paid by thefarmer, in taxes, in the instruments of agriculture, and in the manufacturesused in his own family, and in the families of his labourers. It is in thismanner that a kind of mortgage is ultimately established on the land, by taxes,and the progress of commercial wealth; and in this sense, all taxes certainlyfall upon the land. Before the existence of national debts, and the accumulationof monied capitals, the simple territorial impost would be the fairest and mosteligible of all taxes; but when these mortgages alluded to have been actuallyestablished, and the interest of them cannot be changed with every new tax,which in many instances is the case, particularly with regard to governmentannuitants, the mortgagee will really and bona fide pay a part of the taxes onconsumption; and though these taxes may still fall wholly on the land, they willnot fall wholly on the landholders. It seems a little hard, therefore, in taxingsurplus produce to make the landlords pay for what they do not receive. At thesame time, it must be confessed, that, independently of these considerations,which makes a land tax partial, it is the best of all taxes, as it is the onlyone which does not tend to raise the price of commodities. Taxes on consumption,by which alone monied revenues can be reached, without an income tax,necessarily raise all prices to a degree greatly injurious to the country. Aland tax, or tax upon net rent, has little or no effect in discouraging theimprovement of land, as many have supposed. It is only a tithe, or a tax, inproportion to the gross produce, which does this. No man in his senses will bedeterred from getting a clear profit of 20l. instead of 10l. because he isalways to pay a fourth or fifth of his clear gains; but when he is to pay a taxin proportion to his gross produce, which, in the case of capital laid out inimprovements, is scarcely ever accompanied with a proportional increase of hisclear gains, it is a very different thing, and must necessarily impede, in agreat degree, the progress of cultivation. I am astonished that so obvious andeasy a commutation for tithes, as a land tax on improved rents, has not beenadopted. Such a tax would be paid by the same persons as before, only in abetter form; and the change would not be felt, except in the advantage thatwould accrue to all the parties concerned, the landlord, the tenant, and theclergyman. Tithes undoubtedly operate as a high bounty on pasture, and a greatdiscouragement to tillage, which in the present peculiar circumstances of thecountry is a very great disadvantage."},{"pageContent":"CHAP. IXDifferent Effects of the Agricultural and Commercial Systems.ABOUT the middle of the last century, we were genuinely, and in the strict senseof the Economists, an agricultural nation. Our commerce and manufactures were,however, then in a very respectable and thriving state; and if they hadcontinued to bear the same relative proportion to our agriculture, they wouldevidently have gone on increasing considerably, with the improving cultivationof the country. There is no apparent limit to the quantity of manufactures whichmight in time be supported in this way. The increasing wealth of a country insuch a state, seems to be out of the reach of all common accidents. There is nodiscoverable germ of decay in the system; and in theory, there is no reason tosay, that it might not go on increasing in wealth and prosperity for thousandsof years.We have now, however, stepped out of the agricultural system, into a state, inwhich the commercial system clearly predominates; and there is but too muchreason to fear, that even our commerce and manufactures will ultimately feel thedisadvantage of the change. It has been already observed, that we are exactly inthat situation, in which a country feels most fully the effect of those commonyears of deficient crops, which, in the natural course of things, are to beexpected. The competition of increasing commercial wealth, operating upon asupply of corn not increasing in the same proportion, must at all times greatlytend to raise the price of labour; but when scarce years are taken into theconsideration, its effect in this way must ultimately be prodigious. We know howextremely difficult it is in England to lower the wages of labour, after theyhave once been raised. During the late scarcities, the price of labour has beencontinually rising – not to fall again; the rents of land have been every whereadvancing – not to fall again; and of course, the price of produce must rise –not to fall again; as, independently of a particular competition from scarcity,or the want of competition from plenty, its price is necessarily regulated bythe wages of labour, and the rent of land. We have no reason whatever forsupposing that we shall be exempt in future from such scarcities as we have oflate experienced. On the contrary, upon our present system, they seem to beunavoidable. And if we go on, as we have done lately, the price of labour and ofprovisions must soon increase in a manner out of all proportion to their pricein the rest of Europe; and it is impossible that this should not ultimatelycheck all our dealings with foreign powers, and give a fatal blow to ourcommerce and manufactures. The effect of capital, skill, machinery, andestablishments, in their full vigour, is great; so great, indeed, that it isdifficult to guess at its limit; but still it is not infinite, and without doubthas this limit. The principal states of Europe, except this fortunate island,have of late suffered so much by the actual presence of war; that their commerceand manufactures have been nearly destroyed, and we may be said in a manner tohave the monopoly of the trade of Europe. All monopolies yield high profits, andat present, therefore, the trade can be carried on to advantage, in spite of thehigh price of labour. But when the other nations of Europe shall have had timeto recover themselves, and gradually to become our competitors, it would be rashto affirm, that, with the prices of provisions and of labour still going onincreasing, from what they are at present, we shall be able to stand thecompetition. Dr. Smith says, that, in his time, merchants frequently complainedof the high price of British labour as the cause of their manufactures beingundersold in foreign markets.1[50_IX__Different_effects_of_the_agr.html#id_1147] If such complaints were inany degree founded at that time, how will they be aggravated twenty years hence!And have we not some reason to fear that our present great commercial prosperityis temporary, and belongs a little to that worst feature of the commercialsystem, the rising by the depression of others.When a country, in average years, grows more corn than it consumes, and is inthe habit of exporting a part of it, its price, and the price of labour asdepending on it, can never rise in any very extraordinary degree above thecommon price in other commercial countries; and under such circumstances,England would have nothing to fear from the fullest, and most open competition.The increasing prosperity of other countries, would only open to her a moreextensive market for her commodities, and give additional spirit to all hercommercial transactions.The high price of corn and of rude produce in general, as far as it isoccasioned by the freest competition among the nations of Europe, is a verygreat advantage, and is the best possible encouragement to agriculture; but whenoccasioned merely by the competition of monied wealth at home, its effect istotally different. In the one case, a great encouragement is given to productionin general, and the more is produced, the better. In the other case, the produceis necessarily confined to the home consumption. The cultivators are justlyafraid of growing too much corn, as a considerable loss will be sustained uponthat part of it which is sold abroad; and a glut in the home market willuniversally make the price fall below the fair and proper recompence to thegrower. It is impossible that a country, under such circumstances, should not besubject to great and frequent variations in the price of corn, and occasionallyto severe scarcities.If we were to endeavour to lower the price of labour by encouraging theimportation of foreign corn, we should probably aggravate the evil tenfold.Experience warrants us in saying, that, from political fears, or other causes,the fall in the price of labour would be uncertain; but the ruin of ouragriculture would be certain. The British grower of corn could not, in his ownmarkets, stand the competition of the foreign grower, in average years. Weshould be daily thrown more and more into a dependence upon other countries forour support. Arable lands of a moderate quality would not pay the expence ofcultivation. Rich soils alone would yield a rent. Round all our towns, theappearances would be the same as usual; but in the interior of the country, halfof the lands would be neglected, and almost universally, where it waspracticable, pasture would take place of tillage. How dreadfully precariouswould our commerce and manufactures, and even our very existence be, under suchcircumstances! It could hardly be expected that a century should elapse withoutseeing our population repressed within the limits of our scanty cultivation; andsuffering the same melancholy reverse, as the once flourishing population ofSpain.Nothing perhaps will shew more clearly the absurdity of that artificial system,which prompts a country, with a large territory of its own, to depend uponothers for its food, than the supposition of the same system being pursued bymany other states. If France, Germany, and Prussia, were to become manufacturingnations, and to consider agriculture as a secondary concern, how would theirwants, in the indispensable article of food, be supplied. The increasing demandfor corn, would tend certainly to encourage the growth of it in Russia andAmerica; but we know that in these countries, at present, particularly inAmerica, the natural progress of population is not very greatly checked; andthat, as their towns and manufactories increase, the demand for their own cornwill of course increase with them. The Russian nobleman, whose revenue dependsupon the number of his boors, will hardly be persuaded to check their increase,in order to accommodate other nations; and the independent cultivator of Americawill surely feed his own family and servants, and probably supply the homemarket, before he begins to export. But allowing that at first, and for sometime, the increasing demands of these manufacturing countries might beadequately supplied; yet this could not in the nature of things last long. Themanufacturers, from the decay of agriculture in their own countries, wouldannually want more; and Russia and America, from their rapidly increasingpopulation, and the gradual establishment of manufactures at home, wouldannually be able to spare less. From these causes and the necessity of drawing apart of such vast supplies of corn from a much greater distance inland, andloaded perhaps with the expence of land carriage, the price would ultimatelyrise so extravagantly high, that the poor manufacturers would be totally unableto pay it, and want and famine would convince them too late of the precariousand subordinate nature of their wealth. They would learn by painful experience,that, though agriculture may flourish considerably, and give plenty andhappiness to great numbers, without many manufactures; yet, that manufacturescannot stir a single step, without their agricultural pay masters, either athome or abroad; and that therefore it is the height of folly and imprudence, tohave these pay masters at a great distance, with different interests, and theirpayments precarious, instead of at home, with the same interests, and theirpayments always ready and certain. Nothing can be so hateful to a liberal mind,as the idea of being placed in a situation in which the growing prosperity ofyour neighbours will be the signal of your own approaching ruin. Yet this wouldbe the situation of the principal countries of Europe, if they depended chieflyupon Russia and America, or any other nations for their corn. A system, which,like the present commercial system of England, throws a country into this state,without any physical necessity for it, cannot be founded on the genuineprinciples of the wealth of nations.It seems almost impossible, that a country possessed of a considerableterritory, should have its means of subsistence well assured, without growing athome more corn than it consumes. Nor can it be exempt from those great andsudden variations of price, which produce such severe distress throughout solarge a part of the community, and are often attended with great and lastingdisadvantages; unless this superfluity of produce bear some considerableproportion to the common deficiencies of unfavourable years. It has been almostuniversally acknowledged that there is no branch of trade, more profitable to acountry, even in a commercial point of view, than the sale of rude produce. Ingeneral, its value bears a much greater proportion to the expence incurred inprocuring it, than that of any other commodity whatever, and the national profiton its sale is in consequence greater. This is often noticed by Dr. Smith; butin combating the arguments of the Economists, he seems for a moment to forgetit, and to speak of the superior advantage of exporting manufactures.He observes, that a trading and manufacturing country exports what can subsistand accommodate but very few, and imports the subsistence and accommodation of agreat number. The other, exports the subsistence and accommodation of a greatnumber, and imports that of a very few only. The inhabitants of the one mustalways enjoy a much greater quantity of subsistence, than what their own landsin the actual state of their cultivation could afford. The inhabitants of theother must always enjoy a much smaller quantity.2[50_IX__Different_effects_of_the_agr.html#id_1149]In this passage he does not seem to argue with his usual accuracy. Though themanufacturing nation may export a commodity which, in its actual shape, can onlysubsist and accommodate a very few; yet it must be recollected, that, in orderto prepare this commodity for exportation, a considerable part of the revenue ofthe country had been employed in subsisting and accommodating a great number ofworkmen. And with regard to the subsistence and accommodation which the othernation exports, whether it be of a great or a small number, it is certainly nomore than sufficient to replace the subsistence that had been consumed in themanufacturing nation, together with the profits of the master manufacturer andmerchant, which, probably, are not so great as the profits of the farmer and themerchant in the agricultural nation. And though it may be true, that theinhabitants of the manufacturing nation enjoy a greater quantity of subsistencethan what their own lands, in the actual state of their cultivation, couldafford; yet an inference in favour of the manufacturing system by no meansfollows, because the adoption of the one, or the other system, will make thegreatest difference in their actual state of cultivation. If, during the courseof a century, two landed nations were to pursue these two different systems,that is, if one of them were regularly to export manufactures, and importsubsistence; and the other to export subsistence, and import manufactures, therewould be no comparison at the end of the period, between the state ofcultivation in the two countries; and no doubt could rationally be entertainedthat the country which exported its raw produce, would be able to subsist andaccommodate a much greater population than the other.In the ordinary course of things, the exportation of raw produce is sufficientlyprofitable to the individuals concerned in it. But with regard to nationalprofit, it possesses two peculiar and eminent advantages above any other kind ofexport. In the first place, raw produce, and more particularly corn, pays fromits own funds the expences of procuring it, and the whole of what is sold is aclear national profit. If I set up a new manufacture, the persons employed in itmust be supported out of the funds of subsistence already existing in thecountry, the value of which must be deducted from the price for which thecommodity is sold, before we can estimate the clear national profit; and ofcourse, this profit can only be the profit of the master manufacturer and theexporting merchant. But if I cultivate fresh land, or employ more men in theimprovement of what was before cultivated, I increase the general funds ofsubsistence in the country. With a part of this increase I support all theadditional persons employed, and the whole of the remainder which is exportedand sold, is a clear national gain; besides the advantage to the country, ofsupporting an additional population equal to the additional number of persons soemployed, without the slightest tendency to diminish the plenty of the rest.Secondly, it is impossible always to be secure of having enough, if we have not,in general, too much; and the habitual exportation of corn, seems to be the onlypracticable mode of laying by a store of sufficient magnitude to answer theemergencies, that are to be expected. The evil of scarcity is so dreadful, thatany branch of commerce, the tendency of which is to prevent it, cannot but beconsidered, in a national point of view, as pre-eminently beneficial.These two advantages, added to that which must necessarily accrue tomanufactures from the steady and comparatively low price of provisions and oflabour, are so striking, that it must be a point of the first consequence to thepermanent prosperity of any country, to be able to carry on the export trade ofcorn, as one considerable branch of its commercial transactions.But how to give this ability, how to turn a nation from the habit of importingcorn, to the habit of exporting it, is the great difficulty. It has beengenerally acknowledged, and is frequently noticed by Dr. Smith, that the policyof modern Europe has led it to encourage the industry of the towns more than theindustry of the country, or, in other words, trade more than agriculture. Inthis policy, England has certainly not been behind the rest of Europe; perhaps,indeed, except in one instance,3[50_IX__Different_effects_of_the_agr.html#id_1151] it may be said that she hasbeen the foremost. If things had been left to take their natural course, thereis no reason to think that the commercial part of the society would haveincreased beyond the surplus produce of the cultivators; but the high profits ofcommerce from monopolies, and other peculiar encouragements, have altered thisnatural course of things; and the body politick is in an artificial, and in somedegree, diseased state, with one of its principal members out of proportion tothe rest. Almost all medicine is in itself bad; and one of the great evils ofillness is, the necessity of taking it. No person can well be more averse tomedicine in the animal economy, or a system of expedients in political economy,than myself; but in the present state of the country, something of the kind maybe necessary to prevent greater evils. It is a matter of very little comparativeimportance, whether we are fully supplied with broadcloth, linens, and muslins,or even with tea, sugar, and coffee; and no rational politician therefore, wouldthink of proposing a bounty upon such commodities. But it is certainly a matterof the very highest importance, whether we are fully supplied with food; and ifa bounty would produce such a supply, the most liberal political economist mightbe justified in proposing it; considering food as a commodity distinct from allothers, and pre-eminently valuable.NOTES1 [50_IX__Different_effects_of_the_agr.html#id_1146].

X.Of Bounties on the Exportation of Corn.IT is acknowledged by Dr. Smith, that the encouragement given to the industry ofthe towns has turned more capital into that channel than would otherwise havegone to it; and if this be true, it follows that the land must have had lessthan its natural share; and under such a discouragement, we cannot reasonablyexpect that agriculture should be able to keep pace with manufactures. The cornlaws, as they were established in 1688 and 1700, did not do more than place themupon an equality.The regulations respecting importation and exportation adopted in these cornlaws, seemed to have the effect of giving that encouragement to agriculture,which it so much wanted, and the apparent result was gradually to produce agrowth of corn in the country, considerably above the wants of the actualpopulation, and consequently to lower greatly the prices of it, and give asteadiness to these prices that had never been experienced before.During the seventeenth century, and indeed the whole period of our historyprevious to it, the prices of wheat were subject to great fluctuations, and theaverage price was very high. For fifty years before the year 1700, the averageprice of wheat per quarter was 3l. 11d. and before 1650 it was 6l. 8s. 10d.1[51_X__Of_bounties_on_the_exportatio.html#id_1155] From the time of thecompletion of the corn laws in 1700 and 1706, the prices became extraordinarilysteady; and the average price for forty years previous to the year 1750, sunk solow as 1l. 16s. per quarter. This was the period of our greatest exportations.In the year 1757, the laws were suspended, and in the year 1773, they weretotally altered. The exports of corn have since been regularly decreasing, andthe imports increasing. The average price of wheat for the forty years ending in1800, was 2l. 9s. 5d; and for the last five years of this period, 3l. 6s. 6d.During this last term, the balance of the imports of all sorts of grain isestimated at 2,938,357,2 [51_X__Of_bounties_on_the_exportatio.html#id_1153] andthe dreadful fluctuations of price which have occurred of late years, we are buttoo well acquainted with.It is at all times dangerous to be hasty in drawing general inferences frompartial experience; but, in the present instance, the period that has beenconsidered is of so considerable an extent, and the changes from fluctuating andhigh prices, to steady and low prices, with a return to fluctuating and highprices again, correspond so accurately with the establishment and full vigour ofthe corn laws, and with their subsequent alterations and inefficacy, that it wascertainly rather a bold assertion in Dr. Smith to say, that the fall in theprice of corn must have happened in spite of the bounty, and could not possiblyhave happened in consequence of it.3[51_X__Of_bounties_on_the_exportatio.html#id_1157] We have a right to expectthat he should defend a position, so contrary to all apparent experience, by themost powerful arguments. As in the present state of this country, the subjectseems to be of the highest importance, it will be worth while to examine thevalidity of these arguments.He observes, that both in years of plenty and in years of scarcity, the bountynecessarily tends to raise the money price of corn somewhat higher than itotherwise would be in the home market.4[51_X__Of_bounties_on_the_exportatio.html#id_2201]That it does so, in years of plenty is undoubtedly true; but that it does so inyears of scarcity, appears to me as undoubtedly false. The only argument bywhich Dr. Smith supports this latter position, is, by saying, that theexportation prevents the plenty of one year from relieving the scarcity ofanother. But this is certainly a very insufficient reason. The scarce year maynot immediately follow the most plentiful year; and it is totally contrary tothe habits and practice of farmers, to save the superfluity of six or sevenyears for a contingency of this kind. Great practical inconveniences generallyattend the keeping of so large a reserved store. Difficulties often occur from awant of proper accommodations for it. It is at all times liable to damage fromvermin, and other causes. When very large, it is apt to be viewed with a jealousand grudging eye by the common people. And in general the farmer may either notbe able to remain so long without his returns; or may not be willing to employso considerable a capital in a way, in which the returns must necessarily bedistant and precarious. On the whole, therefore, we cannot reasonably expect,that, upon this plan, the reserved store should in any degree be equal to that,which in a scarce year would be kept at home, in a country which was in thehabit of constant exportation to a considerable amount; and we know that even avery little difference in the degree of deficiency, will often make a very greatdifference in the price.Dr. Smith then proceeds to state, very justly, that the defenders of the cornlaws do not insist so much upon the price of corn in the actual state oftillage, as upon their tendency to improve this actual state, by opening a moreextensive foreign market to the corn of the farmer, and securing to him a betterprice than he could otherwise expect for his commodity: which doubleencouragement they imagine must, in a long period of years, occasion such anincrease in the production of corn, as may lower its price in the home marketmuch more than the bounty can raise it, in the state of tillage then actuallyexisting.5 [51_X__Of_bounties_on_the_exportatio.html#id_1159]In answer to this, he observes, that whatever extension of the foreign marketcan be occasioned by the bounty, must, in every particular year, be altogetherat the expence of the home market, as every bushel of corn, which is exported bymeans of the bounty, and which would not have been exported without the bounty,would have remained in the home market to increase the consumption, and to lowerthe price of that commodity.In this observation he appears to me a little to misuse the term market.Because, by selling a commodity below its natural price, it is possible to getrid of a greater quantity of it, in any particular market, than would have goneoff otherwise, it cannot justly be said that, by this process, such a market isproportionally extended. Though the removal of the two taxes mentioned by Dr.Smith, as paid on account of the bounty, would certainly rather increase thepower of the lower classes to purchase; yet in each particular year theconsumption must be ultimately limited by the population; and the increase ofconsumption from the removal of these taxes, might by no means be sufficient totake off the whole superfluity of the farmers, without lowering the generalprice of corn, so as to deprive them of their fair recompence.Suppose, that the cultivators in England had a million quarters of wheat, beyondwhat would supply the country, at a price, for which they must sell their wholecrop, or lose their fair profits. And suppose, at the same time, that, from thehigh price of land, the great taxes on consumption, and the consequent highprice of labour, the British farmer cannot grow corn at the average price inEurope, which is always true when a bounty upon exportation is renderednecessary. Under these circumstances if the cultivators endeavoured to force theadditional million of quarters on the home market, it is perfectly clear, thatnot only the price of this additional million, but the price of their wholecrop, would fall very considerably; and, without a bounty, it could not answerto the farmer to export, till the prices in the home market had fallen below theaverage price in Europe, which we supposed to be lower, than what would properlypay to the British farmer the expences of cultivation. The purchasers in thehome market would undoubtedly live for this year in great plenty. They might eatas much bread as they pleased themselves, and perhaps even feed their hogs andtheir horses on wheat corn; but the farmers in the mean time would be ruined,and would dread, as the greatest of all evils, the growing of too much corn.Finding, therefore, that tillage would not answer to them, they would of courseneglect the plough, and gradually lay more of their land into pasture, till thereturn of scarcity, or at least the total removal of the superfluity, had againraised the prices to such a height as would make it answer to them to grow corn,provided that they never overstocked the home market. An individual farmercannot know the quantity of corn that is sown by his brother farmers in othercounties. The state of the future supply, in proportion to the future demand,remains in a great measure concealed till the harvest; and the cheapness ordearness of the current year can alone regulate the conduct of the farmer in themanagement of his land for the following year. Under such circumstances, greatvariations in the supply of corn, and consequently in its price, mustnecessarily occur.There cannot be a greater discouragement to the production of any commodity in alarge quantity, than the fear of overstocking the market with it.6[51_X__Of_bounties_on_the_exportatio.html#id_1163] Nor can there be a greaterencouragement to such a production, than the certainty of finding an effectualmarket for any quantity, however great, that can be obtained. It is obvious,that in the case which we have supposed, nothing but a bounty upon corn canextend the effectual market for it to the British farmer.Dr. Smith goes on to say, that if the two taxes paid by the people on account ofthe bounty, namely, the one to the government to pay this bounty, and the otherpaid in the advanced price of the commodity, in the actual state of the crop, donot raise the price of labour, and thus return upon the farmer; they must reducethe ability of the labouring poor to bring up their children, and, by thusrestraining the population and industry of the country, must tend to stunt andrestrain the gradual extension of the home market, and thereby, in the long run,rather to diminish than to augment the whole market and consumption of corn.7[51_X__Of_bounties_on_the_exportatio.html#id_1161]I think it has been shewn, and indeed it will scarcely admit of a doubt, thatthe system of exportation arising from the bounty, has an evident tendency inyears of scarcity to increase the supplies of corn, or to prevent their being somuch diminished as they otherwise would be, which comes to the same thing.Consequently, the labouring poor will be able to live better, and the populationwill be less checked in these particular years, than they would have beenwithout the system of exportation arising from the bounty. But if the effect ofthe bounty, in this view of the subject, be only to repress a little thepopulation in years of plenty, while it encourages it comparatively in years ofscarcity, its effect is evidently to regulate the population more equallyaccording to that quantity of subsistence, which can permanently, and withoutoccasional defalcations, be supplied. And this effect, I have no hesitation insaying, is one of the greatest advantages which can possibly occur to a society,and contributes more to the happiness of the labouring poor, than can easily beconceived by those who have not deeply considered the subject. In the wholecompass of human events, I doubt if there be a more fruitful source of misery,or one more invariably productive of disastrous consequences, than a suddenstart of population from two or three years of plenty, which must necessarily berepressed on the first return of scarcity, or even of average crops. With thepresent high price of labour, and the existing habits of the poor, in thiscountry, I should consider it as a great misfortune, if from the late alarmsrespecting scarcity, and the unusual quantity of corn sown in consequence ofthem, the price of wheat, for the next two years, were to fall to ten or twelvepounds the load. It is not to be doubted, that in this case a more than usualnumber of marriages would take place among the common people. The mouths wouldbe rapidly increasing; but as this price of corn, with the present advancedrents of land, accumulated taxes on consumption, and high price of labour, wouldcertainly not repay the farmer, the supplies would be rapidly decreasing, andthe consequences are but too obvious.The most plausible argument that Dr. Smith adduces against the corn laws, is,that, as the money price of corn regulates that of all other homemadecommodities, the advantage to the proprietor from the increased money price ismerely apparent, and not real; since what he gains in his sales, he must lose inhis purchases.8 [51_X__Of_bounties_on_the_exportatio.html#id_1167]This position, however, is not true, without many limitations.9[51_X__Of_bounties_on_the_exportatio.html#id_1165] The money price of corn, in aparticular country, is undoubtedly by far the most powerful ingredient inregulating the price of labour, and of all other commodities; but it is not thesole ingredient. Many parts of the raw produce of land, though affected by theprice of corn, do not, by any means, rise and fall exactly in proportion to thisprice. When great improvements in manufacturing machinery have taken place inany country, the part of the expence arising from the wages of labour will beara comparatively small proportion to the whole value of the wrought commodity,and consequently, the price of it, though affected by the price of corn, willnot be affected proportionally. When great and numerous taxes on consumptionexist in any country, those who live by the wages of labour must always receivewherewithal to pay them, at least all those upon necessaries, such as soap,candles, leather, salt, &c. A fall in the price of corn, therefore, though itwould decrease that part of the wages of labour which resolves itself into food,evidently, would not decrease the whole in the same proportion. And besidesthese, and other limitations that might be named, the experienced difficulty oflowering wages when once they have been raised, should be taken intoconsideration before the position can be practically applied.During the first half of the eighteenth century, the price of corn graduallyfell, and that, in a very considerable degree; but it does not appear that theprice of labour fell in consequence of it. If this effect therefore did not takeplace in the course of fifty years, we could hardly expect that it would inseven or eight. And if with the view of lowering the price of labour, thefarmers were to push their superfluity on the home market, the disappointment ofthis view would clearly disable them from growing the same quantity of corn infuture: and under such circumstances, it is obvious, that a bounty alone couldencourage them to continue the same growth of corn, and that this bounty is agreat positive advantage to them, and far from being merely apparent, as Dr.Smith endeavours to prove.Even supposing, that either by glutting the home market with British corn, or bythe importation of foreign corn, duty free, we could succeed in lowering thewages of labour, the expences of the British farmer in raising corn and bringingit to market, would not be lowered in proportion. One of the principalingredients in the price of British corn, is the high rent of land; another, thenumerous taxes on consumption which the farmer pays in his instruments ofagriculture, his horses, his windows, and the necessary expences of hisestablishment. While these ingredients of price remained the same, a fall in thewages of labour could not proportionally affect the price at which British corncould be brought to market:10 [51_X__Of_bounties_on_the_exportatio.html#id_1171]and the British farmer would labour under a very considerable disadvantage in acompetition with the farmers of America and the shores of the Baltic, wherethese two ingredients of price are comparatively trifling.When Dr. Smith says, that the nature of things has stamped upon corn a realvalue, which cannot be altered by merely altering the money price; and that nobounty upon exportation, no monopoly of the home market, can raise that value;nor the freest competition lower it;11[51_X__Of_bounties_on_the_exportatio.html#id_1169] it is evident, that hechanges the question from the profits of the growers of corn in any particularcountry, to the physical and absolute value of corn in itself. Nothing can bemore obvious than that the competition of farmers who pay few or no taxes, andlittle comparative rent for their land, must lower the profits of those wholabour under these disadvantages, and other things being equal, must ultimatelyjustle them out of the market. And it is also obvious, that the bounty to thosewho labour under these disadvantages, must tend to raise their profits and givethem a fairer chance of standing the competition with the others. But all thiswhile, undoubtedly, the physical value of corn remains just the same, untouchedeither by competition, or bounty. I certainly do not mean to say, that thebounty alters the physical value of corn, and makes a bushel of it support agreater number of labourers for a day, than it did before; but I certainly domean to say, that the bounty to the British cultivator does, in the actual stateof things, really increase his profits on this commodity; and by thus making thegrowth of corn answer to him, encourages him to sow more than he otherwise woulddo, and enables him in consequence to employ more bushels of corn in themaintenance of a greater number of labourers. For, even supposing that the partof the price of labour which depends directly upon corn, were to rise and fallexactly with the variations in the price of this commodity, it is demonstrablyevident, that the other two principal ingredients in the price remaining thesame, every rise in the money price of corn would be a positive gain to thegrower or proprietor, and every fall a positive loss. And were we to go stillfurther, and suppose that the rent of land would vary in the same way, whichmight be the case in the long run; yet still the money taxes on consumptionremaining unaltered, the effect of a rise or fall in the money price of corn,would be to benefit or injure the grower or proprietor though in a less degreethan before. But in applying a theory to practice, all circumstances shouldcertainly be taken into consideration; and in judging of the practical effectsof the corn laws, or the opposite system, of importation duty free, not only, aswas before observed, the difficulty of lowering the price of labour should beattended to, but also the length of time which it would require to lower therents of land, and the probable ruin of agriculture before these two objectscould be effected.If Dr. Smith’s theory be just, and if it be impossible in the nature of thingsto encourage the growth of corn by bounties, or any other human institutions,then it follows clearly, that every rich country must cease to grow corn, assoon as the price of labour, the rents of land, and the taxes on consumption,rise so high as to exceed the advantages of superior skill and a home market. Aswe cannot force people to raise a commodity which will not pay them, this pointevidently forms an impassable limit to the agriculture of all modern countrieswhich have a free intercourse with others; and, from this period, they mustdaily grow more and more dependent upon their less rich neighbours for theirsubsistence.But if the reasons that have been adduced against this theory be judged valid,then it will appear, that though agriculture be not altogether so manageable asmanufactures, yet that it is still capable of being encouraged and protected byhuman institutions. And that consequently a system of laws respecting bountiesupon exportation, and duties upon importation, framed according to thecircumstances of a particular country, with reference to the expence of bringingcorn to market at home, and the average price of foreign corn, may make theproduction of this commodity answer to the farmers of such a country, howeverhigh may be, the taxes on consumption, the rent of land, and the price oflabour.And if it be admitted, that the cultivation of corn is susceptible of beingencouraged by a bounty like other commodities, it will scarcely fail to follow,that the greater plenty, occasioned by this encouragement, will in the long runlower the price.After all the circumstances which have been before mentioned as affecting price,have had their due weight, another cause must enter into our considerationcapable of producing the greatest variations, and in its immediate effects morepowerful than all the rest combined. This is, the proportion of the supply tothe demand. A degree of plenty, indeed, which forces farmers to sell their cornbelow prime cost, evidently cannot last long; but the effects of scarcity areoften permanent. The practical difficulty of lowering wages has before beennoticed, but the same difficulty by no means exists with regard to raising them.Two or three years of high price from accidental causes are generally sufficientto do this; and when they are followed, as they generally are, by a rise in therents of land, the extreme difficulty of a return to the former state ofcheapness is obvious. Though it be allowed, therefore, that the growing of morecorn, in average years, than is wanted for home consumption, in consequence of abounty upon exportation, cannot permanently sink the price below what willfairly pay the British farmer; yet if it prevent that continual, and oftenpermanent rise, occasioned by every slight deficiency of supply or increase ofdemand,12 [51_X__Of_bounties_on_the_exportatio.html#id_1173] its effect willclearly be, to keep the average price of corn lower than it otherwise would be.When a habit of considerable exportation prevails in consequence of a bounty, aslight increase of demand, or deficiency of supply, will produce scarcely anyperceptible effect in the price of corn in the home market. This price can neverexceed the average price in the ports of the commercial world, with the additionof the bounty, whatever that may be; and this addition will be absolutelynothing, compared with the increase of price which arises from the slightestdeficiency of supply; a deficiency which the system of importation in a large,rich, and populous country, such as Great Britain, will always render probable,not only in the home market, but in all the ports of the commercial world, as wehave lately experienced to our cost.And if the ultimate tendency of the bounty be clearly to lower the average priceof corn in the home market, all Dr. Smith’s just reasonings respecting thedisadvantage of the cheapness of silver in any particular country, or thedearness of all other commodities, return upon himself, and are applicable infavour of the corn laws, not against them.We are now indeed feeling the disadvantage of the cheapness of silver in thiscountry, and in a few years, when our commercial competitors have recovered fromtheir late depression, shall probably feel it much more than we do at present;but it certainly is not owing to a system of exporting corn in consequence ofthe corn laws; but, apparently, to our having altered these corn laws in such amanner as to make them fail in producing the effect of exportation.That we can readily, and with perfect facility, turn ourselves from animporting, to an exporting nation, in the article of corn, I would by no meanspretend to say; but both theory, and the experience of the first half of thelast century, warrant us in concluding it practicable; and we cannot but allowthat it is worth the experiment, as the continuance of our national greatness,and commercial prosperity, seem absolutely to depend upon it. If we proceed inour present course, let us but for a moment reflect on the probableconsequences. There cannot be a doubt, that, in the course of a few years, weshall draw from America, and the nations bordering on the Baltic, as much as twomillions quarters of wheat, besides other corn, the support of above twomillions of people. If, under these circumstances, any commercial discussion, orother dispute, were to arise with these nations, with what a weight of powerthey would negotiate! Not the whole British navy could offer a more convincingargument than the simple threat of shutting all their ports. I am not unaware,that, in general, you may securely depend upon people’s not acting directlycontrary to their interest. But this consideration, all powerful as it is, willsometimes yield voluntarily to national indignation, and is sometimes forced toyield to the resentment of a sovereign. It is of sufficient weight in practice,when applied to manufactures; because a delay in their sale is not of suchimmediate consequence, and from their smaller bulk, they are easily smuggled.But in the case of corn, a delay of three or four months may produce the mostcomplicated misery; and from the great bulk of corn, it will generally be in thepower of a sovereign to execute almost completely his resentful purpose. Smallcommercial states which depend nearly for the whole of their supplies on foreignpowers, will always have many friends. They are not of sufficient consequence toexcite any general indignation against them, and if they cannot be supplied fromone quarter, they will from another. But this is by no means the case with sucha country as Great Britain, whose commercial ambition is peculiarly calculatedto excite a general jealousy, and in fact has excited it, to a very greatdegree. If our commerce continue increasing for a few years, and our commercialpopulation with it, we shall be laid so bare to the shafts of fortune, thatnothing but a miracle can save us from being struck. The periodical return ofsuch seasons of dearth, as those which we have of late experienced, I consideras absolutely certain, upon our present importing system: but, excluding fromthe question, at present, the dreadful distress that they occasion, whichhowever no man of humanity can long banish from his mind, I would ask, is itpolitick, merely with a view to our national greatness, to render ourselves thusdependent upon others for our support, and put it in the power of a combinationagainst us, to diminish our population two millions?To restore our independence, and build our national greatness and commercialprosperity on the sure foundation of agriculture; it is evidently notsufficient, to propose premiums for tillage, to cultivate this or that waste, oreven to pass a general inclosure bill, though these may be all good as far asthey go. If the increase of the commercial population keep pace with theseefforts, we shall only be where we were before, with regard to the necessity ofimportation. The object required, is to alter the relative proportion betweenthe commercial and the agricultural population of the country, which can only bedone by some system, which will permanently raise the profits of agriculture,encourage cultivators to employ more labour in the growing of corn, andcompletely secure them from all apprehensions of overstocking the market. I seeno other way, at present, of effecting this object, but by a system of corn lawsadapted to the peculiar circumstances of the country, and the state of foreignmarkets. All systems of peculiar restraints and encouragements are undoubtedlydisagreeable, and the necessity of resorting to them may justly be lamented. Butthe objection which Dr. Smith brings against bounties in general, that, offorcing some part of the industry of the country into a channel lessadvantageous than that in which it would run of its own accord,13[51_X__Of_bounties_on_the_exportatio.html#id_1177] does not apply in the presentinstance, on account of the pre-eminent qualities of the products ofagriculture, and the dreadful consequences that attend the slightest failure ofthem. The nature of things has, indeed, stamped upon corn a peculiar value,14[51_X__Of_bounties_on_the_exportatio.html#id_1175] and this remark, made by Dr.Smith for another purpose, may fairly be applied to justify the exception ofthis commodity from the objections against bounties in general. If, throughoutthe commercial world, every kind of trade were perfectly free, one shouldundoubtedly feel the greatest reluctance in proposing any interruption to such asystem of general liberty; and indeed, under such circumstances, agriculturewould not need peculiar encouragements. But under the present universalprevalence of the commercial system, with all its different expedients ofencouragement and restraint, it is folly to except from our attention the greatmanufacture of corn which supports all the rest. The high duties paid on theimportation of foreign manufactures, are so direct an encouragement to themanufacturing part of the society, that nothing but some encouragement of thesame kind, operating with the same force, can place the manufacturers andcultivators of this country on a fair footing. Any system of encouragement,therefore, which might be found necessary for the commerce of grain, wouldevidently be owing to the prior encouragements which had been given tomanufactures. We consider the woollen manufacture of England as of the firstimportance, and protect and encourage it with peculiar care; but can anythinking man compare its influence on the strength and prosperity of the state,with the manufacture of corn, the scarcity or failure of which, will involve init the failure of the favourite manufacture itself. If all be free, I havenothing to say; but if we protect and encourage, it seems to be folly not toencourage that production, which of all others is the most important andvaluable.15 [51_X__Of_bounties_on_the_exportatio.html#id_1179]Let it not, however, be imagined, that the most enlightened system ofagriculture, though it will undoubtedly be able to produce food beyond thedemands of the actual population, can ever be made to keep pace with anunchecked population. The errors that have arisen from the constant appearanceof a full supply, produced by the agricultural system, and the source of someother prejudices on the subject of population, will be noticed in the followingchapter.NOTES1 [51_X__Of_bounties_on_the_exportatio.html#id_1154].

Though I have dwelt muchon the importance of raising a quantity of corn in the country beyond thedemands of the home consumption, yet I do not mean to recommend that generalsystem of ploughing, which takes place in most parts of France, and defeats itsown purpose. A large stock of cattle is not only necessary as a very valuablepart of the food of the country, and as contributing very greatly to thecomforts of a considerable portion of its population; but it is also necessaryin the production of corn itself. A large surplus produce, in proportion to thenumber of persons employed, can never be obtained without a great stock ofcattle. At the same time, it does not follow, that we should throw all the landthat is fit for it into pasture. It is an observation of Arthur Young, and Ishould think a just one, that the first and most obvious improvement inagriculture, is to make the fallows of a country support the additional cattleand sheep wanted in it. (Travels in France, vol. i. p. 361.) I am by no meanssanguine, however, as to the practicability of converting England again into anexporting country, while the demands for the products of pasture are dailyincreasing, from the increasing riches of the commercial part of the nation. Butshould this be really considered as impracticable, it seems to point out to us,one of the great causes of the decay of nations. We have always heard, thatstates and empires have their periods of declension; and we learn from history,that the different nations of the earth have flourished in a kind of succession;and that poor countries have been continually rising on the ruins of theirricher neighbours. Upon the commercial system, this kind of succession seems tobe in the natural and necessary course of things, independently of the effectsof war. If from the increasing riches of the commercial part of any nation andthe consequently increasing demands for the products of pasture, more lands weredaily laid down to grass, and more corn imported from other countries, theunavoidable consequence seems to be, that the increasing prosperity of thesecountries, which their exportations of corn would contribute to accelerate, mustultimately destroy the population and power of the countries which had fosteredthem. The ancients always attributed this natural weakness and old age of statesto luxury. But the moderns, who have generally considered luxury as a principalencouragement to commerce and manufactures, and consequently a powerfulinstrument of prosperity, have, with great appearance of reason, been unwillingto consider it as a cause of decline. But allowing with the moderns, all theadvantages of luxury, and when it falls short of actual vice, they are certainlygreat; there seems to be a point, beyond which it must necessarily becomeprejudicial to a state, and bring with it the seeds of weakness and decay. Thispoint is, when it is pushed so far, as to trench on the funds necessary for itssupport, and to become an impediment instead of an encouragement to agriculture.I should be much misunderstood, if, from anything that I have said in the fourlast chapters, I should be considered as not sufficiently aware of theadvantages derived from commerce and manufactures. I look upon them as the mostdistinguishing characteristics of civilization, the most obvious and strikingmarks of the improvement of society, and calculated to enlarge our enjoyments,and add to the sum of human happiness. No great surplus produce of agriculturecould exist without them, and if it did exist, it would be comparatively of verylittle value. But still they are rather the ornaments and embellishments of thepolitical structure than its foundations. While these foundations are perfectlysecure, we cannot be too solicitous to make all the apartments convenient andelegant; but if there be the slightest reason to fear that the foundationsthemselves may give way, it seems to be folly to continue directing ourprincipal attention to the less essential parts. The most determined friend ofcommerce and manufactures must allow, that the persons employed in them cannotexist without the food to support them; and I cannot persuade myself to believethat they can be sufficiently secure of this food, if they depend for itprincipally on other countries. There has never yet been an instance in history,of a large nation continuing, with undiminished vigour, to support four or fivemillions of its people on imported corn; nor do I believe that there ever willbe such an instance in future. England is, undoubtedly, from her insularsituation, and commanding navy, the most likely to form an exception to thisrule; but considering the subject as a general question in political economy,these advantages must evidently be looked upon as peculiar and incidental; andwhat might be applicable to England, would not be so to other countries. Inspite, however, of the peculiar advantages of England, it appears to me clearthat if she continue yearly to increase her importations of corn, she cannotultimately escape that decline which seems to be the natural and necessaryconsequence of excessive commercial wealth; and the growing prosperity of thosecountries which supply her with corn, must, in the end, diminish her population,her riches, and her power. I am not now speaking of the next twenty or thirtyyears, but of the next two or three hundred. And though we are little in thehabit of looking so far forwards, yet it may be questioned, whether we have aright knowingly to adopt a system which must necessarily terminate in theweakness and decline of our posterity. But whether we make any practicalapplication of such a discussion or not, it is curious to contemplate the causesof those reverses in the fates of empires, which so frequently changed the faceof the world in past times, and may be expected to produce similar, thoughperhaps not such violent, changes in future. War was, undoubtedly, in ancienttimes, the principal cause of these changes; but it frequently only finished awork which excess of luxury and the neglect of agriculture had begun. Withregard to ourselves, we should recollect that it is only within the last twentyor thirty years, that we have become an importing nation. In so short a period,it could hardly be expected, that the evils of the system should be perceptible.We have, however, already felt some of its inconveniences; and if we perseverein it, its evil consequences may by no means be a matter of remote speculation.It has been before observed, that, if from the beginning every kind of trade hadbeen left to find its own level, agriculture would probably never have wantedany particular support; but when once this general and desirable liberty hasbeen infringed, it seems to be clearly our interest to attend principally tothose parts of the political structure, which in the actual circumstances of thecountry appear to be comparatively the weakest; and, upon this principle, weshould be justified in giving particular encouragement to manufactures in suchcountries as Poland, and the southern parts of Siberia, and the same kind ofencouragement to agriculture, in England."},{"pageContent":"CHAP. XI.Of the principal Sources of the prevailing Errors on the Subject of Population.IT has been observed, that many countries at the period of their greatest degreeof populousness, have lived in the greatest plenty, and have been able to exportcorn; but at other periods, when their population was very low, have lived incontinual poverty and want, and have been obliged to import corn. Egypt,Palestine, Rome, Sicily, and Spain, are cited as particular exemplifications ofthis fact: and it has been inferred, that an increase of population in anystate, not cultivated to the utmost, will tend rather to augment than diminishthe relative plenty of the whole society; and that, as Lord Kaimes observes, acountry cannot easily become too populous for agriculture; because agriculturehas the signal property of producing food in proportion to the number ofconsumers.1 [52_XI__Of_the_principal_sources_of.html#id_1183]The general facts from which these inferences are drawn, there is no reason todoubt; but the inferences by no means follow from the premises. It is the natureof agriculture, particularly when well conducted, to produce support for aconsiderable number above that which it employs; and consequently if thesemembers of the socicty, or as Sir James Steuart calls them, the free hands, donot increase, so as to reach the limit of the number which can be supported bythe surplus produce, the whole population of the country may continue for agesincreasing with the improving state of agriculture, and yet always be able toexport corn. But this increase, after a certain period, will be very differentfrom the natural, and unrestricted, increase of population; it will merelyfollow the slow augmentation of produce from the gradual improvement ofagriculture; and population will still be checked by the difficulty of procuringsubsistence. It is very justly observed by Sir James Steuart, that thepopulation of England in the middle of the last century when the exports of cornwere considerable, was still checked for want of food.2[52_XI__Of_the_principal_sources_of.html#id_1181] The precise measure of thepopulation in a country thus circumstanced, will not, indeed, be the quantity offood, because part of it is exported, but the quantity of employment. The stateof this employment, however, will necessarily regulate the wages of labour, onwhich depends the power of the lower classes of people to procure food; andaccording as the employment in the country is increasing, whether slowly, orrapidly, these wages will be such, as either to check, or to encourage, earlymarriages, such, as to enable a labourer to support, only two or three, or asmany as five or six, children.The quantity of employment in any country will not of course vary from year toyear, in the same manner as the quantity of produce must necessarily do, fromthe variation of the seasons; and consequently the check from want of employmentwill be much more steady in its operation, and be much more favourable to thelower classes of people, than the check from the immediate want of food. Thefirst will be the preventive check; the second the positive check. When thedemand for labour is either stationary, or increasing very slowly, people, notseeing any employment open by which they can support a family, or the wages ofcommon labour being inadequate to this purpose, will of course be deterred frommarrying. But if a demand for labour continue increasing with some rapidity,although the supply of food be uncertain, on account of variable seasons, and adependence on other countries, the population will evidently go on, till it ispositively checked by famine, or the diseases arising from severe want.Scarcity and extreme poverty, therefore, may, or may not, accompany anincreasing population, according to circumstances. But they must necessarilyaccompany a permanently declining population; because there never has been, norprobably ever will be, any other cause than want of food, which makes thepopulation of a country permanently decline. In the numerous instances ofdepopulation which occur in history, the causes of it may always be traced tothe want of industry, or the ill direction of that industry, arising fromviolence, bad government, ignorance, &c. which first occasions a want of food,and of course depopulation follows. When Rome adopted the custom of importingall her corn, and laying all Italy into pasture, she soon declined inpopulation. The causes of the depopulation of Egypt and Turkey have already beenalluded to; and, in the case of Spain, it was certainly not the numerical lossof people, occasioned by the expulsion of the Moors; but the industry andcapital thus expelled, which permanently injured her population. When a countryhas been depopulated by violent causes, if a bad government, with its usualconcomitant, insecurity of property, ensue, which has generally been the case inall those countries which are now less peopled than formerly; neither the foodnor the population can recover themselves, and the inhabitants will probablylive in severe want. But when an accidental depopulation takes place, in acountry which was before populous and industrious, and in the habit of exportingcorn, if the remaining inhabitants be left at liberty to exert, and do exert,their industry in the same direction as before, it is a strange idea toentertain, that they would then be unable to supply themselves with corn in thesame plenty; particularly, as the diminished numbers would, of course, cultivateprincipally the more fertile parts of their territory, and not be obliged, as intheir more populous state, to apply to ungrateful soils. Countries in thissituation would evidently have the same chance of recovering their formernumber, as they had originally of reaching this number; and indeed if absolutepopulousness were necessary to relative plenty, as some agriculturists havesupposed,3 [52_XI__Of_the_principal_sources_of.html#id_1185] it would beimpossible for new colonies to increase with the same rapidity as old states.The prejudices on the subject of population, bear a very striking resemblance tothe old prejudices about specie, and we know how slowly, and with whatdifficulty, these last have yielded to juster conceptions. Politiciansobserving, that states which were powerful and prosperous, were almostinvariably populous, have mistaken an effect for a cause, and concluded thattheir population was the cause of their prosperity, instead of their prosperitybeing the cause of their population, as the old political economists concluded,that the abundance of specie was the cause of national wealth, instead of theeffect of it. The annual produce of the land and labour, in both theseinstances, became, in consequence, a secondary consideration, and its increase,it was conceived, would naturally follow the increase of specie in the one case,or of population in the other. The folly of endeavouring, by forcible means, toincrease the quantity of specie in any country, and the absolute impossibilityof accumulating it beyond a certain level by any human laws that can be devised,are now fully established, and have been completely exemplified in the instancesof Spain and Portugal; but the illusion still remains respecting population; andunder this impression, almost every political treatise has abounded in proposalsto encourage population, with little or no comparative reference to the means ofits support. Yet, surely, the folly of endeavouring to increase the quantity ofspecie in any country without an increase of the commodities which it is tocirculate, is not greater, than that of endeavouring to increase the number ofpeople, without an increase of the food which is to maintain them; and it willbe found, that the level above which no human laws can raise the population of acountry, is a limit more fixed and impassable, than the limit to theaccumulation of specie. However improbable, in fact, it is possible to conceive,that means might be invented of retaining a quantity of specie in a state,greatly beyond what was demanded by the produce of its land and labour; butwhen, by great encouragements, population has been raised to such a height, thatthis produce is meted out to each individual in the smallest portions that cansupport life, no stretch of ingenuity can even conceive the possibility of goingfurther.It has appeared, I think, clearly, in the review of different societies given inthe former part of this work, that those countries, the inhabitants of whichwere sunk in the most barbarous ignorance, or oppressed by the most crueltyranny, however low they might be in actual population, were very populous inproportion to their means of subsistence; and upon the slightest failure of theseasons generally suffered the severities of want. Ignorance and despotism seemto have no tendency to destroy the passion which prompts to increase; but theyeffectually destroy the checks to it from reason and foresight. The improvidentbarbarian who thinks only of his present wants, or the miserable peasant, who,from his political situation, feels little security of reaping what he has sown,will seldom be deterred from gratifying his passions by the prospect ofinconveniences which cannot be expected to press on him under three or fouryears. But though this want of foresight, which is fostered by ignorance anddespotism, tend thus rather to encourage the procreation of children, it isabsolutely fatal to the industry which is to support them. Industry cannot existwithout foresight and security. The indolence of the savage is well known; andthe poor Egyptian or Abyssinian farmer, without capital, who rents land, whichis let out yearly to the highest bidder, and who is constantly subject to thedemands of his tyrannical masters, to the casual plunder of an enemy, and, notunfrequently, to the violation of his miserable contract, can have no heart tobe industrious, and if he had, could not exercise that industry with success.Even poverty itself, which appears to be the great spur to industry, when it hasonce passed certain limits, almost ceases to operate. The indigence which ishopeless, destroys all vigorous exertion, and confines the efforts to what issufficient for bare existence. It is the hope of bettering our condition, andthe fear of want, rather than want itself, that is the best stimulus toindustry, and its most constant and best directed efforts will almost invariablybe found among a class of people above the class of the wretchedly poor.The effect of ignorance and oppression will therefore always be to destroy thesprings of industry, and consequently to diminish the annual produce of the landand labour in any country; and this diminution will inevitably be followed by adecrease of the population, in spite of the birth of any number of childrenwhatever, annually. The desire of immediate gratification, and the removal ofthe restraints to it from prudence, may perhaps, in such countries, promptuniversally to early marriages; but when these habits have once reduced thepeople to the lowest possible state of poverty, they can evidently have nofurther effect upon the population. Their only effect must be on the degree ofmortality; and there is no doubt, that, if we could obtain accurate bills ofmortality in those southern countries, where very few women remain unmarried,and all marry young, the proportion of the annual deaths would be 1 in 17, 18,or 20, instead of 1 in 34, 36, or 40, as in European states, where thepreventive check operates.That an increase of population, when it follows in its natural order, is both apositive good in itself, and absolutely necessary to a further increase in theannual produce of the land and labour of any country, I should be the last todeny. The only question is, what is the natural order of its progress? In thispoint, Sir James Steuart, who has in general explained this subject so well,appears to me to have fallen into an error. He determines that multiplication isthe efficient cause of agriculture, and not agriculture of multiplication.4[52_XI__Of_the_principal_sources_of.html#id_1187] But though it may be allowedthat the increase of people beyond what could easily subsist on the naturalfruits of the earth, first prompted man to till the ground; and that the view ofmaintaining a family, or of obtaining some valuable consideration in exchangefor the products of agriculture, still operates as the principal stimulus tocultivation; yet it is clear, that these products in their actual state, must bebeyond the lowest wants of the existing population, before any permanentincrease can possibly be supported. And we know that multiplication has innumberless instances taken place, which has produced no effect upon agriculture,and has merely been followed by an increase of diseases; but perhaps there is noinstance, where a permanent increase of agriculture, has not effected apermanent increase of population, somewhere or other. Consequently, agriculturemay with more propriety be termed the efficient cause of population, thanpopution of agriculture,5 [52_XI__Of_the_principal_sources_of.html#id_1191]though they certainly re-act upon each other, and are mutually necessary to eachother’s support. This indeed seems to be the hinge on which the subject turns,and all the prejudices respecting population have, perhaps, arisen from amistake about the order of precedence.The author of L’Ami des Hommes, in a chapter on the effects of a decay ofagriculture upon population, acknowledges that he had fallen into a fundamentalerror in considering population as the source of revenue; and that he wasafterwards fully convinced that revenue was the source of population.6[52_XI__Of_the_principal_sources_of.html#id_1189] From a want of attention tothis most important distinction, statesmen, in pursuit of the desireable objectof population, have been led to encourage early marriages, to reward the fathersof families, and to disgrace celibacy; but this, as the same author justlyobserves, is to dress and water a piece of land without sowing it, and yet toexpect a crop.Among the other prejudices which have prevailed on the subject of population, ithas been generally thought, that, while there is either waste among the rich, orland remaining uncultivated in any country, the complaints for want of foodcannot be justly founded, or, at least, that the pressure of distress upon thepoor is to be attributed to the ill-conduct of the higher classes of society,and the bad management of the land. The real effect, however, of these twocircumstances, is merely to narrow the limit of the actual population; but theyhave little or no influence on what may be called the average pressure ofdistress on the poorer members of society. If our ancestors had been so frugaland industrious, and had transmitted such habits to their posterity, thatnothing superfluous was now consumed by the higher classes, no horses were usedfor pleasure, and no land was left uncultivated, a striking difference wouldappear in the state of the actual population; but probably none whatever, in thestate of the lower classes of people, with respect to the price of labour, andthe facility of supporting a family. The waste among the rich, and the horseskept for pleasure, have indeed a little the effect of the consumption of grainin distilleries, noticed before with regard to China. On the supposition thatthe food consumed in this manner may be withdrawn on the occasion of a scarcity,and be applied to the relief of the poor, they operate, certainly, as far asthey go, like granaries which are only opened at the time that they are mostwanted, and must therefore tend rather to benefit than to injure the lowerclasses of society.With regard to uncultivated land, it is evident, that its effect upon the pooris neither to injure, nor to benefit them. The sudden cultivation of it, willindeed tend to improve their condition for a time, and the neglect of landsbefore cultivated, will certainly make their situation worse for a certainperiod; but when no changes of this kind are going forward, the effect ofuncultivated land on the lower classes, operates merely like the possession of asmaller territory. It is, indeed, a point of very great importance to the poor,whether a country be in the habit of exporting or importing corn; but this pointis not necessarily connected with the complete or incomplete cultivation of thewhole territory, but depends upon the proportion of the surplus produce, tothose who are supported by it; and, in fact, this proportion is generally thegreatest, in countries which have not yet completed the cultivation of all theirterritory. If every inch of land in this country were well cultivated, therewould be no reason to expect, merely from this circumstance, that we should beable to export corn. Our power in this respect would depend entirely on theproportion of the surplus produce to the commercial population; and this, ofcourse, would in its turn depend on the direction of capital to agriculture, orcommerce.It is not probable that any country with a large territory should ever becompletely cultivated; and I am inclined to think, that we often draw veryinconsiderate conclusions against the industry and government of states from theappearance of uncultivated lands in them. It seems to be the clear and expressduty of every government, to remove all obstacles, and give every facility, tothe inclosure and cultivation of land; but when this has been done, the restmust be left to the operation of individual interest; and, upon this principle,it cannot be expected that any new land should be brought into cultivation, themanure and the labour necessary for which, might be employed to greateradvantage on the improvement of land already in cultivation; and this is a casewhich will very frequently occur. In countries possessed of a large territory,there will always be a great quantity of land of a middling quality, whichrequires constant dressing to prevent it from growing worse; but which wouldadmit of very great improvement, if a greater quantity of manure and labourcould be employed upon it. The great obstacle to the amelioration of land is thedifficulty, the expence, and, sometimes, the impossibility, of procuring asufficient quantity of dressing. As this instrument of improvement, therefore,is in practice limited, whatever it may be in theory, the question will alwaysbe, how it may be most profitably employed; and in any instance where a certainquantity of dressing and labour employed to bring new land into cultivation,would have yielded a permanently greater produce if employed upon old land, boththe individual and the nation are losers. Upon this principle it is not uncommonfor farmers in some situations, never to dress their poorest land, but to getfrom it merely a scanty crop every three or four years, and to employ the wholeof their manure, which they practically feel is limited, on those parts of theirfarms, where it will produce a greater proportional effect.The case will be different, of course, in a small territory with a greatpopulation, supported on funds not derived from their own soil. In this casethere will be little or no choice of land, and a comparative superabundance ofmanure; and under such circumstances the poorest soils may be brought undercultivation. But for this purpose, it is not mere population that is wanted, buta population which can obtain the produce of other countries, while it isgradually improving its own; otherwise, it would be immediately reduced inproportion to the limited produce of this small and barren territory; and theamelioration of the land might perhaps never take place; or if it did, it wouldtake place very slowly indeed, and the population would always be exactlymeasured by this tardy state, and could not possibly increase beyond it.This subject is illustrated in the cultivation of the Campine in Brabant, which,according to the Abbé Mann,7 [52_XI__Of_the_principal_sources_of.html#id_1193]consisted originally of the most barren and arid sand. Many attempts were madeby private individuals to bring it under cultivation, but without success; whichprove that, as a farming project, and considered as a sole dependence, thecultivation of it would not answer. Some religious houses, however, at lastsettled there, and being supported by other funds, and improving the land merelyas a secondary object, they, by degrees, in the course of some centuries,brought nearly the whole under cultivation, letting it out to farmers as soon asit was sufficiently improved.There is no spot, however barren, which might not be made rich this way, or bythe concentrated population of a manufacturing town; but this is no proofwhatever that with respect to population and food, population has theprecedence, because this concentrated population could not possibly exist,without the preceding existence of an adequate quantity of food in the surplusproduce of some other district.In a country like Brabant or Holland, where territory is the principal want, andnot manure, such a district as the Campine is described to be, may perhaps becultivated with advantage. But in countries, possessed of a large territory, andwith a considerable quantity of land of a middling quality, the attempt tocultivate such a spot, would be a palpable misdirection and waste, both ofindividual and national resources.The French have already found their error in bringing under cultivation toogreat a quantity of poor land. They are now sensible that they have employed inthis way a portion of labour and dressing, which would have produced apermanently better effect, if it had been applied to the further improvement ofbetter land. Even in China, which is so fully cultivated and so fully peopled,barren heaths have been noticed in some districts; which prove, that, distressedas the people appear to be for subsistence, it does not answer to them to employany of their manure on such spots. These remarks will be still furtherconfirmed, if we recollect, that in the cultivation of a large surface of badland, there must necessarily be a very great waste of seed corn.We should not, therefore, be too ready to make inferences against the internaleconomy of a country, from the appearance of uncultivated heaths, without otherevidence. But the fact is, that as no country has ever reached, or probably everwill reach, its highest possible acme of produce, it appears always, as if thewant of industry, or the ill-direction of that industry, was the actual limit toa further increase of produce and population, and not the absolute refusal ofnature to yield any more; but a man who is locked up in a room, may be fairlysaid to be confined by the walls of it, though he may never touch them; and withregard to the principle of population, it is never the question, whether acountry will produce any more, but whether it may be made to produce asufficiency to keep pace with an unchecked increase of people. In China, thequestion is not, whether a certain additional quantity of rice might be raisedby improved culture, but whether such an addition could be expected during thenext twenty-five years, as would be sufficient to support an additional threehundred millions of people. And in this country, it is not the question, whetherby cultivating all our commons, we could raise considerably more corn than atpresent; but whether we could raise sufficient for a population of twentymillions in the next twenty-five years, and forty millions, in the next fiftyyears.The allowing of the produce of the earth to be absolutely unlimited, scarcelyremoves the weight of a hair from the argument, which depends entirely upon thedifferently increasing ratios of population and food: and all that the mostenlightened governments, and the most persevering and best guided efforts ofindustry can do, is to make the necessary checks to population operate moreequably, and in a direction to produce the least evil; but to remove them, is atalk absolutely hopeless.NOTES1 [52_XI__Of_the_principal_sources_of.html#id_1182].

Among others, I allude moreparticularly to Mr. Anderson, who, in a Calm Investigation of the Circumstanceswhich have led to the present Scarcity of Grain in Britain, (published in 1801,)has laboured, with extraordinary earnestness, and I believe with the bestintentions possible, to impress this curious truth on the minds of hiscountrymen. The particular position which he attempts to prove is, that anincrease of population in any state whose fields have not been made to attaintheir highest possible degree of productiveness, (a thing that probably hasnever yet been seen on this globe,) will necessarily have its means ofsubsistence rather augmented, than diminished, by that augmentation of itspopulation; and the reverse. The proposition is, to be sure, expressed ratherobscurely; but, from the context, his meaning evidently is, that every increaseof population tends to increase relative plenty, and vice versà. He concludeshis proofs by observing, that, if the facts which he has thus brought forwardand connected, do not serve to remove the fears of those who doubt thepossibility of this country producing abundance to sustain its increasingpopulation, were it to augment in a ratio greatly more progressive than it hasyet done, he should doubt, whether they could be convinced of it, were one evento rise from the dead to tell them so. Mr. A. is, perhaps, justified in thisdoubt, from the known incredulity of the age, which might cause people to remainunconvinced in both cases. I agree with Mr. A. however, entirely, respecting theimportance of directing a greater part of the national industry to agriculture;but from the circumstance of its being possible for a country with a certaindirection of its industry, always to export corn, although it may be verypopulous, he has been led into the strange error of supposing, that anagricultural country could support an unchecked population.4 [52_XI__Of_the_principal_sources_of.html#id_1186]. Polit. Econ. vol. i. b. i.c. xviii. p. 114.5 [52_XI__Of_the_principal_sources_of.html#id_1190]. Sir James Steuart explainshimself afterwards, by saying that he means principally the multiplication ofthose persons who have some valuable consideration to give for the products ofagriculture; but this is evidently not mere increase of population, and such anexplanation seems to admit the incorrectness of the general proposition.6 [52_XI__Of_the_principal_sources_of.html#id_1188].

I.Of moral restraint, and the foundations of our obligation to practise thisvirtue.AS it appears, that in the actual state of every society which has come withinour review, the natural progress of population has been constantly andpowerfully checked; and as it seems evident, that no improved form ofgovernment, no plans of emigration, no benevolent institutions, and no degree ordirection of national industry, can prevent the continued action of a greatcheck to increase in some form or other; it follows, that we must submit to itas an inevitable law of nature; and the only inquiry that remains, is, how itmay take place with the least possible prejudice to the virtue and happiness ofhuman society. The various checks to population which have been observed toprevail in the same and different countries, seem all to be resolvable intomoral restraint, vice, and misery, and if our choice be confined to these three,we cannot long hesitate in our decision respecting which it would be mosteligible to encourage.In the former edition of this essay, I observed, that, as from the laws ofnature it appeared, that some check to population must exist, it was better thatthis check should arise from a foresight of the difficulties attending a family,and the fear of dependent poverty, than from the actual presence of want andsickness. This idea will admit of being pursued further, and I am inclined tothink, that, from the prevailing opinions respecting population, whichundoubtedly originated in barbarous ages, and have been continued and circulatedby that part of every community, which may be supposed to be interested in theirsupport, we have been prevented from attending to the clear dictates of reasonand nature on this subject.Natural and moral evil seem to be the instruments employed by the Deity inadmonishing us to avoid any mode of conduct, which is not suited to our being,and will consequently injure our happiness. If we be intemperate in eating anddrinking, we are disordered; if we indulge the transports of anger, we seldomfail to commit acts of which we afterwards repent; if we multiply too fast, wedie miserably of poverty and contagious diseases. The laws of nature in allthese cases are similar and uniform. They indicate to us, that we have followedthese impulses too far, so as to trench upon some other law which equallydemands attention. The uneasiness we feel from repletion, the injuries that weinflict on ourselves or others in anger, and the inconveniencies we suffer onthe approach of poverty, are all admonitions to us to regulate these impulsesbetter; and if we heed not this admonition, we justly incur the penalty of ourdisobedience, and our sufferings operate as a warning to others.From the inattention of mankind hitherto, to the consequences of increasing toofast, it must be presumed, that these consequences are not so immediately andpowerfully connected with the conduct which leads to them, as in the otherinstances; but the delayed knowledge of any particular effects does not altertheir nature, nor our obligation to regulate our conduct accordingly, as soon aswe are satisfied of what this conduct ought to be. In many other instances ithas not been till after long and painful experience, that the conduct mostfavourable to the happiness of man has been forced upon his attention. The kindof food, and the mode of preparing it, best suited to the purposes of nutritionand the gratification of the palate; the treatment and remedies of differentdisorders; the bad effects on the human frame, of low and marshy situations; theinvention of the most convenient and comfortable clothing; the construction ofgood houses; and all the advantages and extended enjoyments which distinguishcivilized life; were not pointed out to the attention of man at once; but werethe slow and late result of experience, and of the admonitions received byrepeated failures.Diseases have been generally considered as the inevitable inflictions ofProvidence; but, perhaps, a great part of them may more justly be considered asindications that we have offended against some of the laws of nature. The plagueat Constantinople, and in other towns of the East, is a constant admonition ofthis kind to the inhabitants. The human constitution cannot support such a stateof filth and torpor; and as dirt, squalid poverty, and indolence, are in thehighest degree unfavourable to happiness and virtue, it seems a benevolentdispensation, that such a state should by the laws of nature produce disease anddeath, as a beacon to others to avoid splitting on the same rock.The prevalence of the plague in London till the year 1666, operated in a propermanner on the conduct of our ancestors; and the removal of nuisances, theconstruction of drains, the widening of the streets, and the giving more roomand air to their houses, had the effect of eradicating completely this dreadfuldisorder, and of adding greatly to the health and happiness of the inhabitants.In the history of every epidemick it has almost invariably been observed, thatthe lower classes of people, whose food was poor and insufficient, and who livedcrowded together, in small and dirty houses, were the principal victims. In whatother manner can nature point out to us, that if we increase too fast for themeans of subsistence, so as to render it necessary for a considerable part ofthe society to live in this miserable manner, we have offended against one ofher laws. This law she has declared exactly in the same manner, as she declaresthat intemperance in eating and drinking will be followed by ill health; andthat, however grateful it may be to us at the moment to indulge these passionsto excess, this indulgence will ultimately produce unhappiness. It is as much alaw of nature that repletion is bad for the human frame, as that eating anddrinking, unattended with this consequence, is good for it.An implicit obedience to the impulses of our natural passions would lead us intothe wildest and most fatal extravagancies; and yet we have the strongest reasonsfor believing that all these passions are so necessary to our being, that theycould not be generally weakened or diminished, without injuring our happiness.The most powerful and universal of all our desires is the desire of food, and ofthose things, such as clothing, houses, &c. which are immediately necessary torelieve us from the pains of hunger and cold. It is acknowledged by all, thatthese desires put in motion the greatest part of that activity from which springthe multiplied improvements and advantages of civilized life; and that thepursuit of these objects and the gratification of these desires form theprincipal happiness of the larger half of mankind, civilized or uncivilized, andare indispensably necessary to the more refined enjoyments of the other half. Weare all conscious, of the inestimable benefits that we derive from these desireswhen directed in a certain manner; but we are equally conscious, of the evilsresulting from them when not directed in this manner; so much so, that societyhas taken upon itself to punish most severely, what it considers as an irregulargratification of them. And yet the desires in both cases are equally natural,and, abstractedly considered, equally virtuous. The act of the hungry man whosatisfies his appetite by taking a loaf from the shelf of another, is in norespect to be distinguished from the act of him who does the same thing with aloaf of his own, but by its consequences. From the consideration of theseconsequences, we feel the most perfect conviction, that if people were notprevented from gratifying their natural desires with the loaves in thepossession of others, that the number of loaves would universally diminish. Thisexperience is the foundation of the laws relating to property, and of thedistinctions of virtue and vice, in the gratification of desires, otherwiseperfectly the same.If the pleasure arising from the gratification of these propensities wereuniversally diminished in vividness, violations of property would become lessfrequent; but this advantage would be greatly overbalanced by the narrowing ofthe sources of enjoyment. The diminution in the quantity of all thoseproductions, which contribute to human gratification, would be much greater, inproportion, than the diminution of thefts; and the loss of general happiness onthe one side, would be beyond comparison greater, than the gain to happiness onthe other. When we contemplate the constant and severe toils of the greatestpart of mankind, it is impossible not to be forcibly impressed with thereflection, that the sources of human happiness would be most cruellydiminished, if the prospect of a good meal, a warm house, and a comfortablefireside in the evening, were not incitements sufficiently vivid, to giveinterest and cheerfulness to the labours and privations of the day.After the desire of food, the most powerful and general of our desires, is, thepassion between the sexes, taken in an enlarged sense. Of the happiness spreadover human life by this passion, very few are unconscious. Virtuous love,exalted by friendship, seems to be that sort of mixture of sensual andintellectual enjoyment, particularly suited to the nature of man, and mostpowerfully calculated to awaken the sympathies of the soul, and produce the mostexquisite gratifications. Perhaps there is scarcely a man who has onceexperienced the genuine delight of virtuous love, however great his intellectualpleasures may have been, that does not look back to the period, as the sunnyspot, in his whole life, where his imagination loves most to bask, which herecollects and contemplates with the fondest regret, and which he would mostwish to live over again.It has been said by Mr. Godwin, in order to shew the evident inferiority of thepleasures of sense, “Strip the commerce of the sexes of all its attendantcircumstances, and it would be generally despised.” He might as well say to aman who admired trees, strip them of their spreading branches, and lovelyfoliage, and what beauty can you see in a bare pole? But it was the tree withthe branches and foliage, and not without them, that excited admiration. It isthe symmetry of person, the vivacity, the voluptuous softness of temper, theaffectionate kindness of feeling, the imagination and the wit”1[54_CHAP__I__Of_moral_restraint__and.html#id_1195] of a woman, which excite thepassion of love, and not the mere distinction of her being a female.It is a very great mistake to suppose, that the passion between the sexes, onlyoperates and influences human conduct, when the immediate gratification of it isin contemplation. The formation and steady pursuit of some particular plan oflife, has been justly considered as one of the most permanent sources ofhappiness; but I am inclined to believe, that there are not many of these plansformed, that are not connected, in a considerable degree, with the prospect ofthe gratification of this passion, and with the support of children arising fromit. The evening meal, the warm house, and the comfortable fireside, would losehalf of their interest, if we were to exclude the idea of some object ofaffection with whom they were to be shared.We have also great reason to believe, that the passion between the sexes has themost powerful tendency to soften and meliorate the human character, and keep itmore alive to all the kindlier emotions of benevolence and pity. Observations onsavage life have generally tended to prove, that nations in which this passionappeared to be less vivid, were distinguished by a ferocious and malignantspirit; and particularly by tyranny and cruelty to the sex. If, indeed, thisbond of conjugal affection were considerably weakened, it seems probable, eitherthat the man would make use of his superior physical strength, and turn his wifeinto a slave, as among the generality of savages; or at best, that every littleinequality of temper which must necessarily occur between two persons, wouldproduce a total alienation of affection; and this could hardly take place,without a diminution of parental fondness and care, which would have the mostfatal effect on the happiness of society.It may be further remarked, that observations on the human character indifferent countries, warrant us in the conclusion, that the passion is stronger,and its general effects in producing gentleness, kindness, and suavity ofmanners, much more powerful, where obstacles are thrown in the way of very earlyand universal gratification. In some of the southern countries where everyimpulse may be almost immediately indulged, the passion sinks into mere animaldesire, is soon weakened and almost extinguished by excess; and its influence onthe character is extremely confined. But in European countries, where, thoughthe women are not secluded, yet manners have imposed considerable restraints onthis gratification, the passion not only rises in force, but in the universalityand beneficial tendency of its effects, and has often the most influence in theformation and improvement of the character, where it is the least gratified.Considering then the passion between the sexes in all its bearings andrelations, and including the endearing engagement of parent and child resultingfrom it, few will be disposed to deny that it is one of the principalingredients of human happiness. Yet experience teaches us that much evil flowsfrom the irregular gratification of it; and though the evil be of little weightin the scale, when compared with the good; yet its absolute quantity cannot beinconsiderable, on account of the strength and universality of the passion. Itis evident, however, from the general conduct of all governments in theirdistribution of punishments, that the evil resulting from this cause is not sogreat, and so immediately dangerous to society, as the irregular gratificationof the desire of property; but placing this evil in the most formidable point ofview, we should evidently purchase a diminution of it at a very dear price, bythe extinction or diminution of the passion which causes it; a change, whichwould probably convert human life, either into a cold and cheerless blank, or ascene of savage and merciless ferocity.A careful attention to the remote as well as immediate effects of all the humanpassions, and all the general laws of nature, leads us strongly to theconclusion, that, under the present constitution of things, few or none of themwould admit of being greatly diminished, without narrowing the sources of good,more powerfully than the sources of evil. And the reason seems to be obvious.They are, in fact, the materials of all our pleasures, as well as of all ourpains; of all our happiness, as well as of all our misery; of all our virtues,as well as of all our vices. It must therefore be regulation and direction thatare wanted, not diminution or extinction.It is justly observed by Dr. Paley, that, “Human passions are either necessaryto human welfare, or capable of being made, and in a great majority of instancesin fact made, conducive to its happiness. These passions are strong and general;and perhaps would not answer their purpose, unless they were so. But strengthand generality, when it is expedient that particular circumstances should berespected, become, if left to themselves, excess and misdirection. From whichexcess and misdirection, the vices of mankind (the causes no doubt of muchmisery) appear to spring. This account, while it shews us the principle of vice,shews us at the same time, the province of reason and self-government.”2[54_CHAP__I__Of_moral_restraint__and.html#id_1197]Our virtue, therefore, as reasonable beings, evidently consists in educing, fromthe general materials which the Creator has placed under our guidance, thegreatest sum of human happiness; and as all our natural impulses areabstractedly considered good, and only to be distinguished by theirconsequences, a strict attention to these consequences, and the regulation ofour conduct conformably to them, must be considered as our principal duty.The fecundity of the human species is, in some respects, a distinctconsideration from the passion between the sexes, as it evidently depends moreupon the power of women in bearing children, than upon the strength or weaknessof this passion. It is, however, a law, exactly similar in its great features toall the other laws of nature. It is strong and general, and apparently would notadmit of any very considerable diminution, without being inadequate to itsobject; the evils arising from it are incidental to these necessary qualities ofstrength and generality; and these evils are capable of being very greatlymitigated, and rendered comparatively light by human energy and virtue. Wecannot but conceive, that it is an object of the Creator, that the earth shouldbe replenished, at least to a considerable degree; and it appears to me clear,that this could not be effected, without a tendency in population to increasefaster than food; and as with the present law of increase, the peopling of theearth does not proceed very rapidly, we have undoubtedly some reason to believe,that this law is not too powerful for its apparent object. The desire of themeans of subsistence would be comparatively confined in its effects, and wouldfail of producing that general activity so necessary to the improvement of thehuman faculties, were it not for the strong and universal effort of population,to increase with greater rapidity than its supplies. If these two tendencieswere exactly balanced, I do not see what motive there would be, sufficientlystrong, to overcome the acknowledged indolence of man, and make him proceed inthe cultivation of the soil. The population of any large territory, howeverfertile, would be as likely to stop at five hundred, or five thousand, as atfive millions, or fifty millions. Such a balance therefore, would clearly defeatone great purpose of creation; and if the question be merely a question ofdegree, a question of a little more, or a little less, strength, we may fairlydistrust our competence to judge of the precise quantity necessary to answer theobject, with the smallest sum of incidental evil. In the present state of thingswe appear to have under our guidance a great power, capable of peopling a desertregion in a small number of years; and yet, under other circumstances, capableof being confined, by human energy and virtue, to any limits, however narrow, atthe expence of a small comparative quantity of evil. The analogy of all theother laws of nature would be completely violated, if in this instance alone,there were no provision for accidental failures, no resources against the vicesof mankind, or the partial mischiefs resulting from other general laws. Toeffect the apparent object without any attendant evil, it is evident, that aperpetual change in the law of increase would be necessary, varying with thevarying circumstances of each country. But instead of this, it is not only moreconsonant to the analogy of the other parts of nature, but we have reason tothink, that it is more conducive to the formation and improvement of the humanmind, that the law should be uniform, and the evils, incidental to it undercertain circumstances, be left to be mitigated or removed by man himself. Hisduties in this case vary with his situation; and he is thus kept more alive tothe consequences of his actions, and his faculties have evidently greater playand opportunity of improvement, than if the evil were removed by a perpetualchange of the law, according to circumstances.Even if from passions too easily subdued, or the facility of illicitintercourse, a state of celibacy were a matter of indifference, and not a stateof some privation, the end of nature in the peopling of the earth would beapparently liable to be defeated. It is of the very utmost importance to thehappiness of mankind, that they should not increase too fast; but it does notappear that the object to be accomplished, would admit of any very considerablediminution in the desire of marriage. It is clearly the duty of each individualnot to marry till he has a prospect of supporting his children; but it is at thesame time to be wished, that he should retain undiminished his desire ofmarriage, in order that he may exert himself to realize this prospect, and bestimulated to make provision for the support of greater numbers.It is evidently therefore, regulation and direction that is required with regardto the principle of population, not diminution or alteration. And if moralrestraint be the only virtuous mode of avoiding the incidental evils arisingfrom this principle, our obligation to practise it will evidently rest exactlyupon the same foundation, as our obligation to practise any of the othervirtues, the foundation of utility.Whatever indulgence we may be disposed to allow to occasional failures in thedischarge of a duty, of acknowledged difficulty; yet, of the strict line ofduty, during the period of celibacy, whatever that may be, we cannot doubt. And,with regard to the necessity of this celibacy in countries that have been longpeopled, or our obligation not to marry till we have a fair prospect of beingable to support our children, it will appear to deserve the attention of themoralist, if it can be proved, that an attention to this obligation is of moreeffect in the prevention of misery, than all the other virtues combined; andthat if, in violation of this duty, it were the general custom to follow thefirst impulse of nature, and marry at the age of puberty, the universalprevalence of every known virtue in the greatest conceivable degree, would failof rescuing society from the most wretched and desperate state of want, and allthe diseases and famines which usually accompany it.NOTES1 [54_CHAP__I__Of_moral_restraint__and.html#id_1194].

II.Of the Effects which would result to Society from the general practice of thisvirtue.ONE of the principal reasons, which has prevented an assent to the doctrine ofthe constant tendency of population to increase beyond the means of subsistence,is, a great unwillingness to believe, that the Deity would, by the laws ofnature, bring beings into existence, which, by the laws of nature, could not besupported in that existence. But if, in addition to that general activity anddirection of our industry put in motion by these laws, we further consider, thatthe incidental evils arising from them, are constantly directing our attentionto the proper check to population, moral restraint; and if it appear, that by astrict obedience to those duties which are pointed out to us by the light ofnature and reason, and are confirmed and sanctioned by revelation, these evilsmay be avoided, the objection will, I trust, be removed, and all apparentimputation on the goodness of the Deity be done away.The heathen moralists never represented happiness as attainable on earth, butthrough the medium of virtue; and among their virtues, prudence ranked in thefirst class, and by some was even considered as including every other. Thechristian religion places our present as well as future happiness in theexercise of those virtues which tend to fit us for a state of superiorenjoyment; and the subjection of the passions to the guidance of reason, which,if not the whole, is a principal branch of prudence, is in consequence mostparticularly inculcated.If, for the sake of illustration, we might be permitted to draw a picture ofsociety, in which, each individual endeavoured to attain happiness by the strictfulfilment of those duties which the most enlightened of the ancientphilosophers deduced from the laws of nature, and which have been directlytaught, and received such powerful sanctions in the moral code of Christianity,it would present a very different scene from that which we now contemplate.Every act which was prompted by the desire of immediate gratification, but whichthreatened an ultimate overbalance of pain, would be considered as a breach ofduty; and, consequently, no man whose earnings were only sufficient to maintaintwo children, would put himself in a situation in which he might have tomaintain four or five, however he might be prompted to it by the passion oflove. This prudential restraint, if it were generally adopted, by narrowing thesupply of labour in the market, would, in the natural course of things, soonraise its price. The period of delayed gratification would be passed in savingthe earnings which were above the wants of a single man, and in acquiring habitsof sobriety, industry, and economy, which would enable him, in a few years, toenter into the matrimonial contract without fear of its consequences. Theoperation of the preventive check in this way, by constantly keeping thepopulation within the limits of the food, though constantly following itsincrease, would give a real value to the rise of wages, and the sums saved bylabourers before marriage, very different from those forced advances in theprice of labour, or arbitrary parochial donations, which, in proportion to theirmagnitude and extensiveness, must of necessity be followed by a proportionaladvance in the price of provisions. As the wages of labour would thus besufficient to maintain with decency a large family, and as every married couplewould set out with a sum for contingencies, all squalid poverty would be removedfrom society, or, at least, be confined to a very few, who had fallen intomisfortunes against which, no prudence or foresight could provide.The interval between the age of puberty, and the period at which each individualmight venture on marriage, must, according to the supposition, be passed instrict chastity; because the law of chastity cannot be violated withoutproducing evil. The effect of any thing like a promiscuous intercourse, whichprevents the birth of children, is evidently to weaken the best affections ofthe heart, and, in a very marked manner, to degrade the female character. Andany other intercourse, would, without improper arts, bring as many children intothe society as marriage, with a much greater probability of their becoming aburden to it.These considerations shew, that the virtue of chastity is not, as some havesupposed, a forced produce of artificial society; but that it has the most realand solid foundation in nature and reason; being apparently the only virtuousmean of avoiding the vice and misery which result from the principle ofpopulation.In such a society as we have been supposing, it might be necessary for bothsexes to pass many of the early years of life in the single state; and if thiswere general, there would certainly be room for a much greater number to marryafterwards, so that fewer, upon the whole, would be condemned to pass theirlives in celibacy. If the custom of not marrying early prevailed generally, andif violations of chastity were equally dishonourable in both sexes, a morefamiliar and friendly intercourse between them might take place without danger.Two young people might converse together intimately, without its beingimmediately supposed, that they either intended marriage or intrigue; and a muchbetter opportunity would thus be given to both sexes of finding out kindreddispositions, and of forming those strong and lasting attachments, withoutwhich, the married state is generally more productive of misery than ofhappiness. The earlier years of life would not be spent without love, thoughwithout the full gratification of it. The passion, instead of beingextinguished, as it now too frequently is by early sensuality, would only berepressed for a time, that it might afterwards burn with a brighter, purer, andsteadier flame; and the happiness of the married state, instead of anopportunity of immediate indulgence, would be looked forward to, as the prize ofindustry and virtue, and the reward of a genuine and constant attachment.1[55_II__Of_the_effects_which_would_r.html#id_1201]The passion of love is a powerful stimulus in the formation of character, andoften prompts to the most noble and generous exertions; but this is only whenthe affections are centered in one object; and generally, when fullgratification is delayed by difficulties.2[55_II__Of_the_effects_which_would_r.html#id_1199] The heart is perhaps never somuch disposed to virtuous conduct, and certainly at no time is the virtue ofchastity so little difficult to men, as when under the influence of such apassion. Late marriages taking place in this way, would be very different fromthose of the same name at present, where the union is too frequently promptedsolely by interested views, and the parties meet, not unfrequently, withexhausted constitutions, and generally with exhausted affections. The latemarriages at present, are indeed principally confined to the men; and there arefew, however advanced in life they may be, who, if they determine to marry, donot fix their choice on a very young wife. A young woman, without fortune, whenshe has passed her twenty-fifth year, begins to fear, and with reason, that shemay lead a life of celibacy; and with a heart capable of forming a strongattachment, feels, as each year creeps on, her hopes of finding an object onwhich to rest her affections gradually diminishing, and the uneasiness of hersituation aggravated by the silly and unjust prejudices of the world. If thegeneral age of marriage among women were later, the period of youth and hopewould be prolonged, and fewer would be ultimately disappointed.That a change of this kind would be a most decided advantage to the morevirtuous half of society, we cannot for a moment doubt. However impatiently theprivation might be borne by the men, it would be supported by the women readilyand cheerfully; and if they could look forwards with just confidence to marriageat twenty-eight or thirty, I fully believe, that if the matter were left totheir free choice, they would clearly prefer waiting till this period, to thebeing involved in all the cares of a large family at twenty-five. The mosteligible age of marriage, however, could not be fixed; but must depend oncircumstances and situation, and must be determined entirely by experience.There is no period of human life at which nature more strongly prompts to anunion of the sexes, than from seventeen or eighteen, to twenty. In every societyabove that state of depression which almost excludes reason and foresight, theseearly tendencies must necessarily be restrained; and if, in the actual state ofthings, such a restraint on the impulses of nature be found unavoidable, at whattime can we be consistently released from it, but at that period, whatever itmay be, when in the existing circumstances of the society a fair prospectpresents itself of maintaining a family.The difficulty of moral restraint, will perhaps be objected to this doctrine. Tohim who does not acknowledge the authority of the Christian religion, I haveonly to say, that, after the most careful investigation, this virtue appears tobe absolutely necessary, in order to avoid certain evils which would otherwiseresult from the general laws of nature. According to his own principles, it ishis duty to pursue the greatest good consistent with these laws; and not to failin this important end, and produce an overbalance of misery, by a partialobedience to some of the dictates of nature while he neglects others. The pathof virtue, though it be the only path which leads to permanent happiness, hasalways been represented by the heathen moralists, as of difficult ascent.To the Christian I would say, that the scriptures most clearly and preciselypoint it out to us as our duty, to restrain our passions within the bounds ofreason; and it is a palpable disobedience of this law, to indulge our desires insuch a manner, as reason tells us, will unavoidably end in misery. The Christiancannot consider the difficulty of moral restraint as any argument against itsbeing his duty; since in almost every page of the sacred writings, man isdescribed as encompassed on all sides by temptations, which it is extremelydifficult to resist; and though no duties are enjoined, which do not contributeto his happiness on earth as well as in a future state, yet an undeviatingobedience is never represented as an easy task.There is in general so strong a tendency to love in early youth, that it isextremely difficult, at this period, to distinguish a genuine, from a transientpassion. If the earlier years of life were passed by both sexes in moralrestraint, from the greater facility that this would give to the meeting ofkindred dispositions, it might even admit of a doubt whether more happymarriages would not take place, and consequently more pleasure from the passionof love, than in a state such as that of America, the circumstances of whichwould allow of a very early union of the sexes. But if we compare theintercourse of the sexes in such a society as I have been supposing, with thatwhich now exists in Europe, taken under all its circumstances, it may safely beasserted, that, independently of the load of misery which would be removed bythe prevalence of moral restraint, the sum of pleasurable sensations from thepassion of love would be increased in a very great degree.If we could suppose such a system general, the accession of happiness to societyin its internal economy, would scarcely be greater than in its externalrelations. It might fairly be expected that war, that great pest of the humanrace, would, under such circumstances, soon cease to extend its ravages sowidely, and so frequently, as it does at present, and might ultimately perhapscease entirely.One of its first causes, and most powerful impulses, was undoubtedly aninsufficiency of room and food; and, greatly as the circumstances of mankindhave changed since it first began, the same cause still continues to operate,and to produce, though in a smaller degree, the same effects. The ambition ofprinces would want instruments of destruction, if the distresses of the lowerclasses of people did not drive them under their standards. A recruitingserjeant always prays for a bad harvest, and a want of employment, or, in otherwords, a redundant population.In the earlier ages of the world, when war was the great business of mankind,and the drains of population from this cause were, beyond comparison, greaterthan in modern times, the legislators and statesmen of each country, advertingprincipally to the means of offence and defence, encouraged an increase ofpeople in every possible way, fixed a stigma on barrenness and celibacy, andhonoured marriage. The popular religions followed these prevailing opinions. Inmany countries, the prolifick power of nature was the object of solemn worship.In the religion of Mahomet, which was established by the sword, and thepromulgation of which, in consequence, could not be unaccompanied by anextraordinary destruction of its followers, the procreation of children toglorify the Creator, was laid down as one of the principal duties of man; and hewho had the most numerous offspring, was considered as having best answered theend of his creation. The prevalence of such moral sentiments had naturally agreat effect in encouraging marriage; and the rapid procreation which followed,was partly the effect and partly the cause of incessant war. The vacanciesoccasioned by former desolations made room for the rearing of fresh supplies;and the overflowing rapidity, with which these supplies followed, constantlyfurnished fresh incitements and fresh instruments for renewed hostilities. Underthe influence of such moral sentiments, it is difficult to conceive how the furyof incessant war should ever abate.It is a pleasing confirmation of the truth and divinity of the Christianreligion, and of its being adapted to a more improved state of human society,that it places our duties respecting marriage, and the procreation of children,in a different light from that in which they were before beheld.Without entering minutely into the subject, which would evidently lead too far,I think it will be admitted, that if we apply the spirit of St. Paul’sdeclarations respecting marriage, to the present state of society, and the knownconstitution of our nature, the natural inference seems to be, that whenmarriage does not interfere with higher duties, it is right; when it does, it iswrong. According to the genuine principles of moral science, “The method ofcoming at the will of God from the light of nature is to inquire into thetendency of the action to promote or diminish the general happiness.”3[55_II__Of_the_effects_which_would_r.html#id_1203] There are perhaps few actionsthat tend so directly to diminish the general happiness, as to marry without themeans of supporting children. He who commits this act, therefore, clearlyoffends against the will of God; and having become a burden on the society inwhich he lives, and plunged himself and family into a situation, in whichvirtuous habits are preserved with more difficulty than in any other, he appearsto have violated his duty to his neighbours and to himself, and thus to havelistened to the voice of passion in opposition to his higher obligations.In a society, such as I have supposed, all the members of which endeavour toattain happiness by obedience to the moral code, derived from the light ofnature, and enforced by strong sanctions in revealed religion, it is evidentthat no such marriages could take place; and the prevention of a redundantpopulation, in this way, would remove one of the principal causes, and certainlythe principal means of offensive war; and at the same time tend powerfully toeradicate those two fatal political disorders, internal tyranny and internaltumult, which mutually produce each other.Weak in offensive war, in a war of defence, such a society would be strong as arock of adamant. Where every family possessed the necessaries of life in plenty,and a decent portion of its comforts and conveniences, there could not existthat hope of change, or at best that melancholy and disheartening indifferenceto it, which sometimes prompts the lower classes of people to say, “let whatwill come, we cannot be worse off than we are now.” Every heart and hand wouldbe united to repel an invader, when each individual felt the value of the solidadvantages which he enjoyed, and a prospect of change presented only a prospectof being deprived of them.As it appears, therefore, that it is in the power of each individual to avoidall the evil consequences to himself and society resulting from the principle ofpopulation, by the practice of a virtue clearly dictated to him by the light ofnature, and expressly enjoined in revealed religion; and as we have reason tothink that the exercise of this virtue to a certain degree, would rather tend toincrease than diminish individual happiness; we can have no reason to impeachthe justice of the Deity, because his general laws make this virtue necessary,and punish our offences against it by the evils attendant upon vice, and thepains that accompany the various forms of premature death. A really virtuoussociety, such as I have supposed, would avoid these evils. It is the apparentobject of the Creator to deter us from vice by the pains which accompany it, andto lead us to virtue by the happiness that it produces. This object appears toour conceptions to be worthy of a benevolent Creator. The laws of naturerespecting population, tend to promote this object. No imputation, therefore, onthe benevolence of the Deity, can be founded on these laws, which is not equallyapplicable to any of the evils necessarily incidental to an imperfect state ofexistence.NOTES1 [55_II__Of_the_effects_which_would_r.html#id_1200]. Dr. Currie, in hisinteresting observations on the character and condition of the Scotch Peasantry,which he has prefixed to his life of Burns, remarks, with a just knowledge ofhuman nature, that “in appreciating the happiness and virtue of a “community,there is perhaps no single criterion on which so much dependence “may be placed,as the state of the intercourse between the sexes. Where this dis-“plays ardourof attachment, accompanied by purity of conduct, the character and “theinfluence of women rise, our imperfect nature mounts in the scale of moral“excellence; and, from the source of this single affection, a stream of felicityde-“scends, which branches into a thousand rivulets, that enrich and adorn thefield “of life.

Paley’s Moral Philosophy,vol. i. b. ii. c. iv. p. 65."},{"pageContent":"CHAP. III.Of the only effectual mode of improving the condition of the Poor.HE who publishes a moral code, or system of duties, however firmly he may beconvinced of the strong obligation on each individual strictly to conform to it,has never the folly to imagine that it will be universally or even generallypractised. But this is no valid objection against the publication of the code.If it were, the same objection would always have applied; we should be totallywithout general rules; and to the vices of mankind arising from temptation,would be added a much longer list, than we have at present, of vices fromignorance.Judging merely from the light of nature, if we feel convinced of the miseryarising from a redundant population, on the one hand, and of the evils andunhappiness, particularly to the female sex, arising from promiscuousintercourse, on the other, I do not see how it is possible for any person, whoacknowledges the principle of utility as the great foundation of morals, toescape the conclusion that moral restraint, till we are in a condition tosupport a family, is the strict line of duty; and when revelation is taken intothe question, this duty undoubtedly receives very powerful confirmation. At thesame time, I believe that few of my readers can be less sanguine in theirexpectations of any great change in the general conduct of men on this subjectthan I am; and the chief reason, why, in the last chapter, I allowed myself tosuppose the universal prevalence of this virtue, was, that I might endeavour toremove any imputation on the goodness of the Deity, by shewing that the evilsarising from the principle of population were exactly of the same nature as thegenerality of other evils which excite fewer complaints, that they wereincreased by human ignorance and indolence, and diminished by human knowledgeand virtue; and on the supposition, that each individual strictly fulfilled hisduty, would be almost totally removed; and this, without any general diminutionof those sources of pleasure, arising from the regulated indulgence of thepassions, which have been justly considered as the principal ingredients ofhuman happiness.If it will answer any purpose of illustration, I see no harm in drawing thepicture of a society in which each individual is supposed strictly to fulfil hisduties; nor does a writer appear to be justly liable to the imputation of beingvisionary, unless he make such universal or general obedience necessary to thepractical utility of his system, and to that degree of moderate and partialimprovement, which is all that can rationally be expected from the most completeknowledge of our duties.But in this respect, there is an essential difference between that improvedstate of society which I have supposed in the last chapter, and most of theother speculations on this subject. The improvement there supposed, if we evershould make approaches towards it, is to be effected in the way in which we havebeen in the habit of seeing all the greatest improvements effected, by a directapplication to the interest and happiness of each individual. It is not requiredof us to act from motives, to which we are unaccustomed; to pursue a generalgood, which we may not distinctly comprehend, or the effect of which may beweakened by distance and diffusion. The happiness of the whole is to be theresult of the happiness of individuals, and to begin first with them. Noco-operation is required. Every step tells. He who persorms his duty faithfullywill reap the full fruits of it, whatever may be the number of others who fail.This duty is express, and intelligible to the humblest capacity. It is merelythat he is not to bring beings into the world for whom he cannot find the meansof support. When once this subject is cleared from the obscurity thrown over itby parochial laws and private benevolence, every man must feel the strongestconviction of such an obligation. If he cannot support his children, they muststarve; and if he marry in the face of a fair probability that he shall not beable to support his children, he is guilty of all the evils which he thus bringsupon himself, his wife, and his offspring. It is clearly his interest, and willtend greatly to promote his happiness, to defer marrying, till, by industry andeconomy, he is in a capacity to support the children that he may reasonablyexpect from his marriage; and as he cannot in the mean time gratify hispassions, without violating an express command of God, and running a great riskof injuring himself, or some of his fellow creatures, considerations of his owninterest and happiness will dictate to him the strong obligation to moralrestraint.However powerful may be the impulses of passion, they are generally in somedegree modified by reason. And it does not seem entirely visionary to suppose,that if the true and permanent cause of poverty were clearly explained, andforcibly brought home to each man’s bosom, it would have some, and perhaps notan inconsiderable, influence on his conduct; at least, the experiment has neveryet been fairly tried. Almost every thing that has been hitherto done for thepoor, has tended, as if with solicitous care, to throw a veil of obscurity overthis subject, and to hide from them the true cause of their poverty. When thewages of labour are hardly sufficient to maintain two children, a man marriesand has five or six. He of course finds himself miserably distressed. He accusesthe insufficiency of the price of labour to maintain a family. He accuses hisparish for their tardy and sparing fulfilment of their obligation to assist him.He accuses the avarice of the rich, who suffer him to want what they can so wellspare. He accuses the partial and unjust institutions of society, which haveawarded him an inadequate share of the produce of the earth. He accuses perhapsthe dispensations of Providence, which have assigned to him a place in societyso beset with unavoidable distress and dependance. In searching for objects ofaccusation, he never adverts to the quarter from which all his misfortunesoriginate. The last person that he would think of accusing is himself, on whom,in fact, the whole of the blame lies, except in as far as he has been deceivedby the higher classes of society. He may perhaps wish that he had not married,because he now feels the inconveniences of it; but it never enters into his headthat he can have done any thing wrong. He has always been told that to raise upsubjects for his king and country is a very meritorious act. He has done thisact, and yet is suffering for it. He naturally thinks that he is suffering forrighteousness sake; and it cannot but strike him as most extremely unjust andcruel in his king and country, to allow him thus to suffer, in return, forgiving them what they are continually declaring that they particularly want.Till these erroneous ideas have been corrected, and the language of nature andreason has been generally heard on the subject of population, instead of thelanguage of error and prejudice, it cannot be said that any fair experiment hasbeen made with the understandings of the common people; and we cannot justlyaccuse them of improvidence and want of industry, till they act as they do now,after it has been brought home to their comprehensions, that they are themselvesthe cause of their own poverty; that the means of redress are in their ownhands, and in the hands of no other persons whatever; that the society in whichthey live, and the government which presides over it, are totally without powerin this respect; and however ardently they may desire to relieve them, andwhatever attempts they may make to do so, they are really and truly unable toexecute what they benevolently wish, but unjustly promise; that when the wagesof labour will not maintain a family, it is an incontrovertible sign that theirking and country do not want more subjects, or at least that they cannot supportthem; that if they marry in this case, so far from fulfilling a duty to society,they are throwing a useless burden on it, at the same time that they areplunging themselves into distress; and that they are acting directly contrary tothe will of God, and bringing down upon themselves various diseases, which mightall, or in a great part, have been avoided, if they had attended to the repeatedadmonitions which he gives, by the general laws of nature, to every beingcapable of reason.Dr. Paley, in his Moral Philosophy, observes, that “in countries in whichsubsistence is become scarce, it behoves the state to watch over the publickmorals with increased solicitude; for nothing but the instinct of nature, underthe restraint of chastity, will induce men to undertake the labour, or consentto the sacrifice of personal liberty and indulgence, which the support of afamily in such circumstances requires.”1[56_III__Of_the_only_effectual_mode.html#id_1205] That it is always the duty ofa state to use every exertion, likely to be effectual, in discouraging vice andpromoting virtue, and that no temporary circumstances ought to cause anyrelaxation in these exertions, is certainly true. The means therefore proposed,are always good; but the particular end in view, in this case, appears to beabsolutely criminal. We wish to force people into marriage, when, from theacknowledged scarcity of subsistence, they will have little chance of being ableto support their children. We might as well force people into the water who areunable to swim. In both cases we rashly tempt Providence. Nor have we morereason to believe, that a miracle will be worked to save us from the misery andmortality resulting from our conduct, in the one case, than in the other.The object of those who really wish to better the condition of the lower classesof society, must be, to raise the relative proportion between the price oflabour and the price of provisions; so as to enable the labourer to command alarger share of the necessaries and comforts of life. We have hithertoprincipally attempted to attain this end, by encouraging the married poor, andconsequently increasing the number of labourers, and overstocking the marketwith a commodity, which we still say that we wish to be dear. It would seem tohave required no great spirit of divination to foretell the certain failure ofsuch a plan of proceeding. There is nothing however, like experience. It hasbeen tried in many different countries, and for many hundred years, and thesuccess has always been answerable to the nature of the scheme. It is reallytime now to try something else.When it was found, that oxygene, or pure vital air, would not cure consumptions,as was expected, but rather aggravated their symptoms; a trial was made of anair of the most opposite kind. I wish we had acted with the same philosophicalspirit in our attempts to cure the disease of poverty; and having found that thepouring in of fresh supplies of labour, only tended to aggravate the symptoms,had tried what would be the effect of withholding a little these supplies.In all old and fully-peopled states, it is from this method, and this alone,that we can rationally expect any essential and permanent amelioration in thecondition of the lower classes of people.In an endeavour to raise the proportion of the quantity of provisions to thenumber of consumers, in any country, our attention would naturally be firstdirected to the increasing of the absolute quantity of provisions; but findingthat as fast as we did this, the number of consumers more than kept pace withit, and that, with all our exertions, we were still as far as ever behind, weshould be convinced that our efforts, directed only in this way, would neversucceed. It would appear to be setting the tortoise to catch the hare. Finding,therefore, that, from the laws of nature, we could not proportion the food tothe population, our next attempt should naturally be to proportion thepopulation to the food. If we can persuade the hare to go to sleep, the tortoisemay have some chance of overtaking her.We are not, however, to relax our efforts in increasing the quantity ofprovisions; but to combine another effort with it, that of keeping thepopulation, when once it has been overtaken, at such a distance behind, as toeffect the relative proportion which we desire; and thus unite the two granddesiderata, a great actual population, and a state of society in which squalidpoverty and dependence are comparatively but little known; two objects which arefar from being incompatible.If we be really serious in what appears to be the object of such generalresearch, the mode of essentially and permanently bettering the condition of thepoor, we must explain to them the true nature of their situation, and show them,that the withholding of the supplies of labour is the only possible way ofreally raising its price; and that they themselves being the possessors of thiscommodity have alone the power to do this.I cannot but consider this mode of diminishing poverty, as so perfectly clear intheory, and so invariably confirmed by the analogy of every other commodity thatis brought to market, that nothing but its being shewn to be calculated toproduce greater evils than it proposes to remedy, can justify us in not makingthe attempt to put it into execution.NOTE1 [56_III__Of_the_only_effectual_mode.html#id_1204]. Vol. ii. c, xi. p. 352."},{"pageContent":"CHAP. IV.Objections to this mode considered.ONE objection, which perhaps will be made to this plan, is that, from whichalone it derives its value – a market rather understocked with labour. This mustundoubtedly take place in a certain degree; but by no means in such a degree asto affect the wealth and prosperity of the country. The way in which we aregoing on at present, and the enormous increase in the price of provisions, whichseems to threaten us, will tend much more effectually to enable foreigners toundersell us in the markets of Europe, than the plan now proposed. If thepopulation of this country were better proportioned to its food, the nominalprice of labour might be lower than it is now, and yet be sufficient to maintaina wife and six children. But putting this subject of a market understocked withlabour, in the most unfavourable point of view, if the rich will not submit to aslight inconvenience necessarily attendant on the attainment of what theyprofess to desire, they cannot really be in earnest in their professions. Theirbenevolence to the poor, must be either childish play, or hypocrisy; it must beeither to amuse themselves, or to pacify the minds of the common people with amere shew of attention to their wants. To wish to better the condition of thepoor, by enabling them to command a greater quantity of the necessaries andcomforts of life, and then to complain of high wages, is the act of a silly boywho gives away his cake and then cries for it. A market overstocked with labour,and an ample remuneration to each labourer, are objects perfectly incompatiblewith each other. In the annals of the world they never existed together; and tocouple them, even in imagination, betrays a gross ignorance of the simplestprinciples of political economy.A second objection that may be made to this plan is, the diminution ofpopulation that it would cause. It is to be considered, however, that thisdiminution is merely relative; and when once this relative diminution had beeneffected, by keeping the population stationary, while the supply of food hadincreased, it might then start afresh, and continue increasing for ages, withthe increase of food, maintaining always the same relative proportion to it. Ican easily conceive, that this country with a proper direction of the nationalindustry, might, in the course of some centuries, contain two or three times itspresent population, and yet, every man in the kingdom be much better fed andclothed than he is at present. While the springs of industry continue in vigour,and a sufficient part of that industry is directed to agriculture, we need beunder no apprehensions of a deficient population; and nothing perhaps would tendso strongly to excite a spirit of industry and economy among the poor, as athorough knowledge that their happiness must always depend principally uponthemselves; and that if they obey their passions in opposition to their reason,or be not industrious and frugal while they are single men, to save a sum forthe common contingencies of the married state, they must expect to suffer thenatural evils which Providence has prepared for those who disobey its repeatedadmonitions.A third objection which may be started to this plan, and the only one whichappears to me to have any kind of plausibility, is, that, by endeavouring tourge the duty of moral restraint on the poor, we may increase the quantity ofvice relating to the sex.I should be most extremely sorry to say any thing which could, either directlyor remotely be construed unfavourably to the cause of virtue: but I certainlycannot think that the vices which relate to the sex, are the only vices whichare to be considered in a moral question; or that they are even the greatest andmost degrading to the human character. They can rarely or never be committedwithout producing unhappiness somewhere or other, and therefore ought always tobe strongly reprobated; but there are other vices, the effects of which arestill more pernicious; and there are other situations, which lead more certainlyto moral offences than the refraining from marriage. Powerful as may be thetemptations to a breach of chastity, I am inclined to think that they areimpotent, in comparison of the temptations arising from continued distress. Alarge class of women, and many men, I have no doubt, pass a considerable part oftheir lives in moral restraint; but I believe there will be found very few, whopass through the ordeal of squalid and hopeless poverty, or even of longcontinued embarrassed circumstances, without a considerable moral degradation ofcharacter.In the higher and middle classes of society, it is a melancholy and distressingsight to observe, not unfrequently, a man of a noble and ingenuous disposition,once feelingly alive to a sense of honour and integrity, gradually sinking underthe pressure of circumstances, making his excuses at first, with a blush ofconscious shame, afraid of seeing the faces of his friends from whom he may haveborrowed money, reduced to the meanest tricks and subterfuges, to delay or avoidthe payment of his just debts; till ultimately grown familiar with falsehood,and at enmity with the world, he loses all the grace and dignity of man.To the general prevalence of indigence, and the extraordinary encouragementswhich we afford in this country to a total want of foresight and prudence amongthe common people,1 [57_IV__Objections_to_this_mode_cons.html#id_1213] is to beattributed the principal part of those continual depredations on property, andother more atrocious crimes, which drive us to the painful resource of such anumber of executions.2 [57_IV__Objections_to_this_mode_cons.html#id_1211]According to Mr. Colquhoun, above twenty thousand miserable individuals ofvarious classes, rise up every morning, without knowing how, or by what means,they are to be supported during the passing day; or where, in many instances,they are to lodge on the succeeding night.3[57_IV__Objections_to_this_mode_cons.html#id_1209] It is by these unhappypersons that the principal depredations on the public are committed; and,supposing but few of them to be married and driven to these acts, from thenecessity of supporting their children; yet still it will not cease to be true,that the too great frequency of marriage among the poorest classes, is one ofthe principal causes of the temptations to these crimes. A considerable part ofthese unhappy wretches will probably be found to be the offspring of suchmarriages, educated in workhouses, where every vice is propagated, or bred up athome in filth and rags, and with an utter ignorance of every moral obligation.4[57_IV__Objections_to_this_mode_cons.html#id_2203] A still greater part,perhaps, consists of persons, who, being unable for some time to get employment,owing to the full supply of labour, have been urged to these extremities bytheir temporary wants, and having thus lost their characters, are rejected, evenwhen their labour may be wanted, by the well-founded caution of civil society.5[57_IV__Objections_to_this_mode_cons.html#id_1207]When indigence does not produce overt acts of vice, it palsies every virtue.Under the continued temptations to a breach of chastity, occasional failures maytake place, and the moral sensibility, in other respects, not be very strikinglyimpaired; but the continued temptations which beset hopeless poverty, and thestrong sense of injustice that generally accompanies it from an ignorance of itstrue cause, tend so powerfully to sour the disposition, to harden the heart, anddeaden the moral sense, that, generally speaking, virtue takes her flight clearaway from the tainted spot, and does not often return.Even with respect to the vices which relate to the sex, marriage has been foundto be by no means a complete remedy. Among the higher classes, our DoctorsCommons, and the lives that many married men are known to lead, sufficientlyprove this; and the same kind of vice, though not so much heard of among thelower classes of people, owing to their indifference and want of delicacy onthese subjects, is probably not very much less frequent.Add to this, that squalid poverty, particularly when joined with idleness, is astate the most unfavourable to chastity that can well be conceived. The passionis as strong, or nearly so, as in other situations, and every restraint on it,from personal respect, or a sense of morality, is generally removed. There is adegree of squalid poverty, in which, if a girl was brought up, I should say thather being really modest at twenty was an absolute miracle. Those persons musthave extraordinary minds indeed, and such as are not usually formed undersimilar circumstances, who can continue to respect themselves, when no otherperson whatever respects them. If the children thus brought up were even tomarry at twenty, it is probable that they would have passed some years invicious habits, before that period.If after all, however, these arguments should appear insufficient; if wereprobate the idea of endeavouring to encourage the virtues of moral restraintand prudence among the poor, from a fear of producing vice; and if we think thatto facilitate marriage by all possible means is a point of the first consequenceto the morality and happiness of the people; let us act consistently, and,before we proceed, endeavour to make ourselves acquainted with the mode by whichalone we can effect our object.NOTES1 [57_IV__Objections_to_this_mode_cons.html#id_1212]. Mr. Colquhoun, speaking ofthe poor laws, observes, that, “in spite of all the ingenious arguments whichhave been used in favour of a system, admitted to be wisely conceived in itsorigin, the effects it has produced incontestably prove, that, with respect tothe mass of the poor, there is something radically wrong in the execution. If itwere not so, it is impossible that there could exist in the metropolis such aninconceivable portion of human misery amidst examples of munificence andbenevolence unparallelled in any age or country.” Police of Metropolis, c. xiii.p. 359.In the effects of the poor laws, I fully agree with Mr. Colquhoun; but I cannotagree with him in admitting that the system was well conceived in its origin. Iattribute still more evil to the original ill conception, than to the subsequentill execution.2 [57_IV__Objections_to_this_mode_cons.html#id_1210]. Mr. Colquhoun observes,that, “Indigence, in the present state of society, may be considered as aprincipal cause of the increase of crimes.” Police of Metropolis, c. xiii. p.352.3 [57_IV__Objections_to_this_mode_cons.html#id_1208]. Id. c. xi. p. 313.4 [57_IV__Objections_to_this_mode_cons.html#id_2202]. Ibid. and c. xii. p. 355,370.5 [57_IV__Objections_to_this_mode_cons.html#id_1206]. Police of the Metropolis,c. xiii. p. 353. et seq. In so large a town as London, which must necessarilyencourage a prodigious influx of strangers from the country, there must bealways a great many persons out of work; and it is possible that some publickinstitution for the relief of the casual poor, upon a plan similar to thatproposed by Mr. Colquhoun, (c. xiii. p. 371.) might, under very judiciousmanagement, produce more good than evil. But, for this purpose, it would beabsolutely necessary, that if work were provided by the institution, the sumthat a man could earn by it, should be less than the worst paid common labour;otherwise the claimants would rapidly increase, and the funds would soon beinadequate to their object. In the institution at Hamburgh, which appears tohave been the most successful of any yet established, the nature of the work wassuch, that, though paid above the usual price, a person could not easily earn byit, more than eighteen pence a week. It was the determined principle of themanagers of the institution to reduce the support which they gave, lower thanwhat any industrious man or woman in such circumstances could earn. (Account ofthe management of the poor in Hamburgh, by C. Voght, p. 18.) And it is to thisprinciple that they attribute their success. It should be observed, however,that neither the institution at Hamburgh, nor that planned by Count Rumford inBavaria, has subsisted long enough for us to be able to pronounce on theirpermanent good effects. It will not admit of a doubt that institutions for therelief of the poor, on their first establishment, remove a great quantity ofdistress. The only question is, whether, as succeeding generations arise, theincreasing funds necessary for their support, and the increasing numbers thatbecome dependent, are not greater evils, than that, which was to be remedied;and whether the country will not ultimately be left with as much mendicity asbefore, besides all the poverty and dependence accumulated in the publickinstitutions. This seems to be nearly the case in England at present. I do notbelieve that we should have more beggars, if we had no poor laws."},{"pageContent":"CHAP. V.Of the consequences of pursuing the opposite mode.IT is an evident truth, that whatever is the state of increase in the means ofsubsistence, the increase of population must be limited by it, at least afterthe food has once been divided into the smallest shares that will support life.All the children born, beyond what would be required to keep up the populationto this level, must necessarily perish, unless room be made for them by thedeaths of grown persons. It has appeared, indeed, clearly in the course of thiswork, that in all old states, the marriages and births depend principally uponthe deaths, and that there is no encouragement to early unions so powerful as agreat mortality. To act consistently, therefore, we should facilitate, insteadof foolishly and vainly endeavouring to impede, the operations of nature, inproducing this mortality; and if we dread the too frequent visitation of thehorrid form of famine, we should sedulously encourage the other forms ofdestruction which we compel nature to use. Instead of recommending cleanlinessto the poor, we should encourage contrary habits. In our towns, we should makethe streets narrower, crowd more people into the houses, and court the return ofthe plague. In the country, we should build our villages near stagnant pools,and particularly encourage settlements in all marshy and unwholesomesituations.1 [58_V__Of_the_consequences_of_pursui.html#id_1215] But above all,we should reprobate specific remedies for ravaging diseases, and thosebenevolent, but much mistaken men, who have thought they were doing a service tomankind by projecting schemes for the total extirpation of particular disorders.If by these, and similar means, the annual mortality were increased from 1 in 36or 40, to 1 in 18 or 20, we might, probably, every one of us marry at the age ofpuberty, and yet few be absolutely starved.If however, we all marry at this age, and yet still continue our exertions toimpede the operations of nature, we may rest assured that all our efforts willbe vain. Nature will not, nor cannot be defeated in her purposes. The necessarymortality must come, in some form or other; and the extirpation of one diseasewill only be the signal for the birth of another, perhaps more fatal. We cannotlower the waters of misery by pressing them down in different places which mustnecessarily make them rise somewhere else: the only way in which we can hope toeffect our purpose is by drawing them off. To this course nature is constantlydirecting our attention by the chastisements which await a contrary conduct.These chastisements are more or less severe, in proportion to the degree inwhich her admonitions produce their intended effect. In this country, atpresent, these admonitions are by no means entirely neglected. The preventivecheck to population prevails to a considerable degree, and her chastisementsare, in consequence, moderate: but if we were all to marry at the age ofpuberty, they would be severe indeed. Political evils would probably be added tophysical. A people goaded by constant distress, and visited by frequent returnsof famine, could not be kept down but by a cruel despotism. We should approachto the state of the people in Egypt or Abyssinia; and I would ask, whether, inthat case, it is probable that we should be more virtuous?Physicians have long remarked the great changes which take place in diseases;and that, while some appear to yield to the efforts of human care and skill,others seem to become, in proportion, more malignant and fatal. Dr. WilliamHeberden published not long since, some valuable observations on this subjectdeduced from the London bills of mortality. In his preface, speaking of thesebills, he says, “the gradual changes they exhibit in particular diseasescorrespond to the alterations which in time are known to take place, in thechannels through which the great stream of mortality is constantly flowing.” 2[58_V__Of_the_consequences_of_pursui.html#id_1217] In the body of his workafterwards, speaking of some particular diseases, he observes with that candourwhich always distinguishes true science: “It is not easy to give a satisfactoryreason for all the changes which may be observed to take place in the history ofdiseases. Nor is it any disgrace to physicians, if their causes are often sogradual in their operation, or so subtle, as to elude investigation.”3[58_V__Of_the_consequences_of_pursui.html#id_2205]I hope I shall not be accused of presumption, in venturing to suggest, that,under certain circumstances, such changes must take place; and perhaps withoutany alteration in those proximate causes which are usually looked to on theseoccasions. If this should appear to be true, it will not seem extraordinary thatthe most skilful and scientific physicians, whose business it is principally toinvestigate proximate causes, should sometimes search for these causes in vain.In a country which keeps its population at a certain standard, if the averagenumber of marriages and births be given, it is evident, that the average numberof deaths will also be given; and, to use Dr. Heberden’s metaphor, the channelsthrough which the great stream of mortality is constantly flowing, will alwaysconvey off a given quantity. Now if we stop up any of these channels, it is mostperfectly clear, that the stream of mortality must run with greater forcethrough some of the other channels; that is, if we eradicate some diseases,others will become proportionally more fatal. In this case the onlydistinguishable cause is the damming up a necessary outlet of mortality.4[58_V__Of_the_consequences_of_pursui.html#id_1219] Nature, in the attainment ofher great purposes, seems always to seize upon the weakest part. If this part bemade strong by human skill, she seizes upon the next weakest part, and so on insuccession; not like a capricious deity, with an intention to sport with oursufferings, and constantly to defeat our labours; but like a kind thoughsometimes severe instructor, with the intention of teaching us to make all partsstrong, and to chace vice and misery from the earth. In avoiding one fault weare too apt to run into some other; but we always find nature faithful to hergreat object, at every false step we commit, ready to admonish us of our errors,by the infliction of some physical or moral evil. If the prevalence of thepreventive check to population, in a sufficient degree, were to remove many ofthose diseases which now afflict us, yet be accompanied by a considerableincrease of the vice of promiscuous intercourse; it is probable that thedisorders and unhappiness, the physical and moral evils arising from this vice,would increase in strength and degree, and, admonishing us severely of ourerror, would point to the only line of conduct approved by nature, reason, andreligion, abstinence from marriage till we can support our children, andchastity till that period arrives.In the case just stated, in which the population and the number of marriages aresupposed to be fixed, the necessity of a change in the mortality of somediseases, from the diminution or extinction of others, is capable ofmathematical demonstration. The only obscurity which can possibly involve thissubject, arises from taking into consideration the effect that might be producedby a diminution of mortality, in increasing the population, or in decreasing thenumber of marriages. That the removal of any of the particular causes ofmortality can have no further effect upon population, than the means ofsubsistence will allow; and that it has little or no influence on these means ofsubsistence, is a fact, of which, I hope, the reader is already convinced. Ofits operation in tending to prevent marriage, by diminishing the demand forfresh supplies of children, I have no doubt; and there is reason to think thatit had this effect, in no inconsiderable degree, on the extinction of theplague, which had so long and so dreadfully ravaged this country. Dr. Heberdendraws a striking picture of the favourable change observed in the health of thepeople of England since this period; and justly attributes it to theimprovements which have gradually taken place, not only in London, but in allgreat towns; and in the manner of living throughout the kingdom, particularlywith respect to cleanliness and ventilation.5[58_V__Of_the_consequences_of_pursui.html#id_1223] But these causes would nothave been adequate to the effect observed, if they had not been accompanied byan increase of the preventive check; and, probably, the spirit of cleanliness,and better mode of living, which then began to prevail, by spreading moregenerally a decent and useful pride, principally contributed to this increase.The diminution in the number of marriages, however, was not sufficient to makeup for the great decrease of mortality, from the extinction of the plague, andthe striking reduction of the deaths in the dysentery.6[58_V__Of_the_consequences_of_pursui.html#id_2207] While these, and some otherdisorders, became almost evanescent, consumption, palsy, apoplexy, gout, lunacy,and the small-pox, became more mortal.7[58_V__Of_the_consequences_of_pursui.html#id_1221] The widening of these drainswas necessary to carry off the population which still remained redundant,notwithstanding the increased operation of the preventive check, and the partwhich was annually disposed of, and enabled to exist, by the increase ofagriculture.Dr. Haygarth, in the sketch of his benevolent plan for the extermination of thecasual small-pox, draws a frightful picture of the mortality which has beenoccasioned by this distemper; attributes to it the slow progress of population;and makes some curious calculations on the favourable effects which would beproduced, in this respect, by its extermination.8[58_V__Of_the_consequences_of_pursui.html#id_2211] His conclusions, however, Ifear, would not follow from his premises. I am far from doubting that millionsand millions of human beings have been destroyed by the small-pox. But were itsdevastations, as Dr. Haygarth supposes, many thousand degrees greater than theplague,9 [58_V__Of_the_consequences_of_pursui.html#id_2209] I should still doubtwhether the average population of the earth had been diminished by them a singleunit. The small-pox is certainly one of the channels, and a very broad one,which nature has opened for the last thousand years, to keep down the populationto the level of the means of subsistence; but had this been closed, others wouldhave become wider, or new ones would have been formed. In antient times themortality from war and the plague, was incomparably greater than in modern. Onthe gradual diminution of this stream of mortality, the generation, and almostuniversal prevalence, of the small-pox is a great and striking instance, of oneof those changes in the channels of mortality, which ought to awaken ourattention, and animate us to patient and persevering investigation. For my ownpart, I feel not the slightest doubt, that, if the introduction of the cow-poxshould extirpate the small-pox, and yet the number of marriages continue thesame, we shall find a very perceptible difference in the increased mortality ofsome other diseases. Nothing could prevent this effect, but a sudden start inour agriculture; and should this take place, which I fear we have not muchreason to expect, it will not be owing to the number of children saved fromdeath by the cow-pox inoculation, but to the alarms occasioned among the peopleof property by the late scarcities, and to the increased gains of farmers, whichhave been so absurdly reprobated. I am strongly, however, inclined to believe,that the number of marriages will not, in this case, remain the same; but thatthe gradual light which may be expected to be thrown, on this interesting topicof human inquiry, will teach us how to make the extinction of a mortal disorder,a real blessing to us, a real improvement in the general health and happiness ofthe society.If, on contemplating the increase of vice which might contingently follow anattempt to inculcate the duty of moral restraint, and the increase of miserythat must necessarily follow the attempts to encourage marriage and population,we come to the conclusion, not to interfere in any respect, but to leave everyman to his own free choice, and responsible only to God for the evil which hedoes, in either way; this is all I contend for; I would on no account do more;but I contend that at present we are very far from doing this.Among the lower classes, where the point is of the greatest importance, the poorlaws afford a direct, constant, and systematical encouragement to marriage, byremoving from each individual that heavy responsibility, which he would incur bythe laws of nature, for bringing beings into the world which he could notsupport. Our private benevolence has the same direction as the poor laws, andalmost invariably tends to facilitate the rearing of families, and to equalize,as much possible, the circumstances of married and single men.Among the higher classes of people, the superior distinctions which marriedwomen receive, and the marked inattentions to which single women of advanced ageare exposed, enable many men, who are neither agreeable in mind or person, andare besides in the wane of life, to choose a partner among the young and fairinstead of being confined, as nature seems to dictate, to persons of nearlytheir own age and accomplishments. It is scarcely to be doubted, that the fearof being an old maid, and of that silly and unjust ridicule, which follysometimes attaches to this name, drives many women into the marriage union, withmen whom they dislike, or, at best, to whom they are perfectly indifferent. Suchmarriages must to every delicate mind appear little better than legalprostitutions; and they often burden the earth with unnecessary children,without compensating for it by any accession of happiness and virtue to theparties themselves.Throughout all the ranks of society, the prevailing opinions respecting the dutyand obligation of marriage, cannot but have a very powerful influence. The manwho thinks that in going out of the world without leaving representatives behindhim, he shall have failed in an important duty to society, will be disposed toforce, rather than to repress, his inclinations on this subject; and when hisreason represents to him the difficulties attending a family, he will endeavournot to attend to these suggestions, will still determine to venture, and willhope that, in the discharge of what he conceives to be his duty, he shall not bedeserted by Providence.In a civilized country, such as England, where a taste for the decencies andcomforts of life prevail among a very large class of people, it is not possiblethat the encouragements to marriage from positive institutions and prevailingopinions, should entirely obscure the light of nature and reason on thissubject; but still they contribute to make it comparatively weak and indistinct.And till this obscurity is entirely removed, and the poor are undeceived withrespect to the principal cause of their past poverty, and taught to know thattheir future happiness or misery must depend chiefly upon themselves, it cannotbe said, that, with regard to the great question of marriage, or celibacy, weleave every man to his own free and fair choice.NOTES1 [58_V__Of_the_consequences_of_pursui.html#id_1214]. Necker, speaking of theproportion of the births in France, makes use of a new and instructiveexpression on this subject, though he hardly seems to be sufficiently aware ofit himself.

VI.Effect of the knowledge of the principal cause of poverty on Civil Liberty.IT may appear, perhaps, that a doctrine, which attributes the greatest part ofthe sufferings of the lower classes of society exclusively to themselves, isunfavourable to the cause of liberty; as affording a tempting opportunity togovernments of oppressing their subjects at pleasure, and laying the whole blameon the laws of nature and the imprudence of the poor. We are not, however, totrust to first appearances; and I am strongly disposed to believe, that thosewho will be at the pains to consider this subject deeply, will be convinced,that nothing would so powerfully contribute to the advancement of rationalfreedom, as a thorough knowledge generally circulated, of the principal cause ofpoverty; and that the ignorance of this cause, and the natural consequences ofthis ignorance, form, at present, one of the chief obstacles to its progress.The pressure of distress on the lower classes of people, with the habit ofattributing this distress to their rulers, appears to me to be the rock ofdefence, the castle, the guardian spirit, of despotism. It affords to the tyrantthe fatal and unanswerable plea of necessity. It is the reason that every freegovernment tends constantly to its destruction; and that its appointed guardiansbecome daily less jealous of the encroachments of power. It is the reason thatso many noble efforts in the cause of freedom have failed, and that almost everyrevolution, after long and painful sacrifices, has terminated in a militarydespotism. While any dissatisfied man of talents has power to persuade the lowerclasses of people, that all their poverty and distress arise solely from theiniquity of the government, though perhaps the greatest part of what they sufferis totally unconnected with this cause, it is evident that the seeds of freshdiscontents, and fresh revolutions, are continually sowing. When an establishedgovernment has been destroyed, finding that their poverty is not removed, theirresentment naturally falls upon the successors to power; and when these havebeen immolated without producing the desired effect, other sacrifices are calledfor, and so on without end. Are we to be surprised, that, under suchcircumstances, the majority of well-disposed people, finding that a government,with proper restrictions, was unable to support itself against the revolutionaryspirit, and weary and exhausted with perpetual change, to which they could seeno end, should give up the struggle in despair, and throw themselves into thearms of the first power which could afford them protection against the horrorsof anarchy.A mob, which is generally the growth of a redundant population, goaded byresentment for real sufferings, but totally ignorant of the quarter from whichthey originate, is, of all monsters, the most fatal to freedom. It fosters aprevailing tyranny, and engenders one where it was not; and though, in itsdreadful fits of resentment, it appears occasionally to devour its unsightlyoffspring; yet no sooner is the horrid deed committed, than, however unwillingit may be to propagate such a breed, it immediately groans with the pangs of anew birth.Of the tendency of mobs to produce tyranny, we may not be long without anexample in this country. As a friend to freedom, and an enemy to large standingarmies, it is with extreme reluctance that I am compelled to acknowledge, that,had it not been for the organized force in the country, the distresses of thepeople during the late scarcities, encouraged by the extreme ignorance and follyof many among the higher classes, might have driven them to commit the mostdreadful outrages, and ultimately to involve the country in all the horrors offamine. Should such periods often recur, a recurrence which we have too muchreason to apprehend from the present state of the country, the prospect whichopens to our view is melancholy in the extreme. The English constitution will beseen hastening with rapid strides to the Euthanasia foretold by Hume; unless itsprogress be interrupted by some popular commotion; and this alternative presentsa picture still more appalling to the imagination. If political discontents wereblended with the cries of hunger, and a revolution were to take place by theinstrumentality of a mob, clamouring for want of food, the consequences would beunceasing change, and unceasing carnage, the bloody career of which, nothing butthe establishment of some complete despotism could arrest.We can scarcely believe that the appointed guardians of British liberty shouldquietly have acquiesced in those gradual encroachments of power, which havetaken place of late years, but from the apprehension of these still moredreadful evils. Great as has been the influence of corruption, I cannot yetthink so meanly of the country gentlemen of England, as to believe that theywould thus have given up a part of their birthright of liberty, if they had notbeen actuated by a real and genuine fear, that it was then in greater dangerfrom the people, than from the crown. They appeared to surrender themselves togovernment on condition of being protected from the mob; but they never wouldhave made this melancholy and disheartening surrender, if such a mob had notexisted either in reality or in imagination. That the fears on this subject wereartfully exaggerated, and increased beyond the limits of just apprehension, isundeniable; but I think it is also undeniable, that the frequent declamationwhich was heard against the unjust institutions of society, and the delusivearguments on equality which were circulated among the lower classes, gave usjust reason to suppose, that if the vox populi had been allowed to speak, itwould have appeared to be the voice of error and absurdity, instead of the voxDei.To say that our conduct is not to be regulated by circumstances, is to betray anignorance of the most solid and incontrovertible principles of morality. Thoughthe admission of this principle may sometimes afford a cloke to changes ofopinion that do not result from the purest motives; yet the admission of acontrary principle would be productive of infinitely worse consequences. Thephrase of existing circumstances has, I believe, not unfrequently created asmile in the English House of Commons; but the smile should have been reservedfor the application of the phrase, and not have been excited by the phraseitself. A very frequent repetition of it, has indeed, of itself, rather asuspicious air; and its application should always be watched with the mostjealous and anxious attention; but no man ought to be judged in limine forsaying, that existing circumstances had obliged him to alter his opinions andconduct. The country gentlemen were perhaps too easily convinced that existingcircumstances called upon them to give up some of the most valuable privilegesof Englishmen; but, as far as they were really convinced of this obligation,they acted consistently with the clearest rule of morality.The degree of power to be given to the civil government, and the measure of oursubmission to it, must be determined by general expediency; and in judging ofthis expediency, every circumstance is to be taken into consideration;particularly, the state of publick opinion, and the degree of ignorance anddelusion prevailing among the common people. The patriot, who might be calledupon by the love of his country, to join with heart and hand in a rising of thepeople for some specifick attainable object or reform, if he knew that they wereenlightened respecting their own situation, and would stop short when they hadattained their demand; would be called upon by the same motive, to submit tovery great oppression, rather than give the slightest countenance to a populartumult, the members of which, at least the greater number of them, werepersuaded, that the destruction of the Parliament, the Lord Mayor, and themonopolizers, would make bread cheap, and that a revolution would enable themall to support their families. In this case, it is more the ignorance anddelusion of the lower classes of people that occasions the oppression, than theactual disposition of the government to tyranny.That there is, however, in all power a constant tendency to encroach is anincontrovertible truth, and cannot be too strongly inculcated. The checks whichare necessary to secure the liberty of the subject, will always, in some degree,embarrass and delay the operations of the executive government. The members ofthis government feeling these inconveniences, while they are exertingthemselves, as they conceive, in the service of their country, and conscious,perhaps, of no ill intention towards the people, will naturally be disposed, onevery occasion, to demand the suspension or abolition of these checks; but ifonce the convenience of ministers be put into competition with the liberties ofthe people, and we get into a habit of relying on fair assurances, and personalcharacter, instead of examining, with the most scrupulous and jealous care, themerits of each particular case, there is an end of British freedom. If we onceadmit the principle that the government must know better with regard to thequantity of power which it wants, than we can possibly do with our limited meansof information, and that therefore, it is our duty to surrender up our privatejudgments, we may just as well, at the same time, surrender up the whole of ourconstitution. Government is a quarter in which liberty is not, nor cannot be,very faithfully preserved. If we are wanting to ourselves, and inattentive toour great interests in this respect, it is the height of folly andunreasonableness, to expect that government will attend to them for us. Shouldthe British constitution ultimately lapse into a despotism, as has beenprophesied, I shall think that the country gentlemen of England will have reallymuch more to answer for than the ministers.To do the country gentlemen justice, however, I should readily acknowledge,that, in the partial desertion of their posts as guardians of British freedom,which has already taken place, they have been actuated more by fear thantreachery. And the principal reason of this fear was, I conceive, the ignoranceand delusions of the common people, and the prospective horrors which werecontemplated, if, in such a state of mind, they should, by any revolutionarymovement, obtain an ascendant.The circulation of Paine’s Rights of Man, it is supposed, has done greatmischief among the lower and middling classes of people in this country. This isprobably true; but not because man is without rights, or that these rights oughtnot to be known; but because Mr. Paine has fallen into some fundamental errorsrespecting the principles of government, and in many important points has shewnhimself totally unacquainted with the structure of society, and the differentmoral effects to be expected from the physical difference between this countryand America. Mobs, of the same description as those collections of people knownby this name in Europe, could not exist in America. The number of people withoutproperty, is, there, from the physical state of the country, comparativelysmall; and therefore the civil power which is to protect property, cannotrequire the same degree of strength. Mr. Paine very justly observes, thatwhatever the apparent cause of any riots may be, the real one is always want ofhappiness; but when he goes on to say, it shews that something is wrong in thesystem of government, that injures the felicity by which society is to bepreserved, he falls into the common error of attributing all want of happinessto government. It is evident, that this want of happiness might have existed,and from ignorance might have been the principal cause of the riots, and yet bealmost wholly unconnected with any of the proceedings of government. Theredundant population of an old state furnishes materials of unhappiness, unknownto such a state as that of America; and if an attempt were to be made to remedythis unhappiness, by distributing the produce of the taxes to the poorer classesof society, according to the plan proposed by Mr. Paine, the evil would beaggravated a hundred fold, and in a very short time, no sum that the societycould possibly raise, would be adequate to the proposed object.Nothing would so effectually counteract the mischiefs occasioned by Mr. Paine’sRights of Man, as a general knowledge of the real rights of man. What theserights are, it is not my business at present to explain; but there is one right,which man has generally been thought to possess, which I am confident he neitherdoes, nor can, possess, a right to subsistence when his labour will not fairlypurchase it. Our laws indeed say, that he has this right and bind the society tofurnish employment and food to those who cannot get them in the regular market;but in so doing, they attempt to reverse the laws of nature; and it is, inconsequence, to be expected, not only that they should fail in their object, butthat the poor who were intended to be benefited, should suffer most cruelly fromthis inhuman deceit which is practised upon them.A man who is born into a world already possessed, if he cannot get subsistencefrom his parents on whom he has a just demand, and if the society do not wanthis labour, has no claim of right to the smallest portion of food, and, in fact,has no business to be where he is. At nature’s mighty feast there is no vacantcover for him. She tells him to be gone, and will quickly execute her ownorders, if he do not work upon the compassion of some of her guests. If theseguests get up and make room for him, other intruders immediately appeardemanding the same favour. The report of a provision for all that come, fillsthe hall with numerous claimants. The order and harmony of the feast isdisturbed, the plenty that before reigned is changed into scarcity; and thehappiness of the guests is destroyed by the spectacle of misery and dependencein every part of the hall, and by the clamorous importunity of those, who arejustly enraged at not finding the provision which they had been taught toexpect. The guests learn too late their error, in counteracting those strictorders to all intruders, issued by the great mistress of the feast, who, wishingthat all her guests should have plenty, and knowing that she could not providefor unlimited numbers, humanely refused to admit fresh comers when her table wasalready full.The Abbé Raynal has said, that “Avant toutes les loix sociales, l’homme avoit ledroit de subsister.”1 [59_VI__Effect_of_the_knowledge_of_t.html#id_1225] Hemight with just as much propriety have said, that, before the institution ofsocial laws, every man had a right to live a hundred years. Undoubtedly he hadthen, and has still, a good right to live a hundred years, nay, a thousand, ifhe can, without interfering with the right of others to live; but the affair, inboth cases, is principally an affair of power, not of right. Social laws verygreatly increase this power, by enabling a much greater number to subsist, thancould subsist without them, and so far very greatly enlarge le droit desubsister; but neither before nor after the institution of social laws, could anunlimited number subsist; and before, as well as since, he who ceased to havethe power, ceased to have the right.If the great truths on these subjects were more generally circulated, and thelower classes of people could be convinced, that, by the laws of nature,independently of any particular institutions, except the great one of propertywhich is absolutely necessary in order to attain any considerable produce, noperson has any claim of right on society for subsistence, if his labour will notpurchase it, the greatest part of the mischievous declamation on the unjustinstitutions of society would fall powerless to the ground. The poor are by nomeans inclined to be visionary. Their distresses are always real, though theyare not attributed to the real causes. If these real causes were properlyexplained to them, and they were taught to know how small a part of theirpresent distress was attributable to government, and how great a part to causestotally unconnected with it, discontent and irritation among the lower classesof people would shew themselves much less frequently than at present; and whenthey did shew themselves, would be much less to be dreaded. The efforts ofturbulent and discontented men in the middle classes of society, might safely bedisregarded, if the poor were so far enlightened respecting the real nature oftheir situation, as to be aware, that by aiding them in their schemes ofrenovation, they would probably be promoting the ambitious views of others,without, in any respect, benefiting themselves. And the country gentlemen, andmen of property in England, might securely return to a wholesome jealousy of theencroachments of power; and, instead of daily sacrificing the liberties of thesubject, on the altar of publick safety, might, without any just apprehensionfrom the people, not only tread back all their late steps, but firmly insistupon those gradual reforms, which the lapse of time, and the storms ofcircumstances, have rendered necessary, to prevent the gradual destruction ofthe British constitution.All improvements in government must necessarily originate with persons of someeducation, and these will of course be found among the people of property.Whatever may be said of a few, it is impossible to suppose that the great massof the people of property should be really interested in the abuses ofgovernment. They merely submit to them, from the fear, that an endeavour toremove them, might be productive of greater evils. Could we but take away thisfear, reform and improvement would proceed with as much facility, as the removalof nuisances, or the paving and lighting the streets. In human life we arecontinually called upon, to submit to a lesser evil, in order to avoid agreater; and it is the part of a wise man to do this readily and cheerfully; butno wise man will submit to any evil, if he can get rid of it, without danger.Remove all apprehension from the tyranny or folly of the people, and the tyrannyof government could not stand a moment. It would then appear in its properdeformity, without palliation, without pretext, without protector. Naturallyfeeble in itself, when it was once stripped naked, and deprived of the supportof publick opinion, and of the great plea of necessity, it would fall without astruggle. Its few interested defenders would hide their heads abashed; and wouldbe ashamed any longer to advocate a cause for which no human ingenuity couldinvent a plausible argument.The most successful supporters of tyranny are without doubt those generaldeclaimers, who attribute the distresses of the poor, and almost all the evilsto which society is subject, to human institutions and the iniquity ofgovernments. The falsity of these accusations, and the dreadful consequencesthat would result from their being generally admitted and acted upon, make itabsolutely necessary that they should at all events be resisted; not only onaccount of the immediate revolutionary horrors to be expected from a movement ofthe people acting under such impressions, a consideration which must at alltimes have very great weight; but on account of the extreme probability thatsuch a revolution would terminate in a much worse despotism, than that which ithad destroyed. On these grounds, a genuine friend of freedom, a zealous advocatefor the real rights of man, might be found among the defenders of a considerabledegree of tyranny. A cause bad in itself, might be supported by the good and thevirtuous, merely because that which was opposed to it was much worse; and at themoment it was absolutely necessary to make a choice between the two. Whatevertherefore may be the intention of those indiscriminate and wholesale accusationsagainst governments, their real effect undoubtedly is, to add a weight oftalents and principles to the prevailing power which it never would havereceived otherwise.It is a truth, which I trust has been sufficiently proved in the course of thiswork, that, under a government constructed upon the best and purest principles,and executed by men of the highest talents and integrity, the most squalidpoverty and wretchedness might universally prevail from the principle ofpopulation alone. And as this cause of unhappiness has hitherto been so littleunderstood, that the efforts of society have always tended rather to aggravatethan to lessen it, we have the strongest reasons for supposing, that, in all thegovernments with which we are acquainted, a very great part of the misery to beobserved among the lower classes of the people, arises from this cause.The inference, therefore, which Mr. Paine and others have drawn againstgovernments from the unhappiness of the people, is palpably unfair; and beforewe give a sanction to such accusations, it is a debt we owe to truth andjustice, to ascertain how much of this unhappiness arises from the principle ofpopulation, and how much is fairly to be attributed to government. When thisdistinction has been properly made, and all the vague, indefinite, and falseaccusations removed, government would remain, as it ought to be, clearlyresponsible for the rest. A tenfold weight would be immediately given to thecause of the people, and every man of principle would join in asserting andenforcing, if necessary, their rights.I may be deceived; but I confess that if I were called to name the cause, which,in my conception, had more than any other contributed to the very slow progressof freedom, so disheartening to every liberal mind, I should say that it was theconfusion that had existed, respecting the causes of the unhappiness anddiscontents which prevail in society; and the advantage which governments hadbeen able to take, and indeed had been compelled to take, of this confusion, toconfirm and strengthen their power. I cannot help thinking, therefore, that aknowledge generally circulated, that the principal cause of want and unhappinessis unconnected with government, and totally beyond its power to remove; and thatit depends upon the conduct of the poor themselves; would, instead of giving anyadvantage to governments, give a great additional weight to the popular side ofthe question, by removing the dangers with which, from ignorance, it is atpresent accompanied; and thus tend, in a very powerful manner, to promote thecause of rational freedom.NOTE1 [59_VI__Effect_of_the_knowledge_of_t.html#id_1224]. Raynal, Hist. des Indes,vol. x. s. x. p. 322. 8vo."},{"pageContent":"CHAP. VII.Plan of the gradual abolition of the Poor Laws proposed.IF the principles in the preceding chapters should stand the test ofexamination, and we should ever feel the obligation of endeavouring to act uponthem, the next inquiry would be, in what way we ought practically to proceed.The first grand obstacle which presents itself in this country, is the system ofthe poor laws, which has been justly stated to be an evil, in comparison ofwhich, the national debt, with all its magnitude of terror, is of littlemoment.1 [60_VII__Plan_of_the_gradual_aboliti.html#id_1229] The extraordinaryrapidity with which the poors rates have increased of late years, presents us,indeed, with the prospect of a monstrous deformity in society, which, if it didnot really exist to a great degree at present, and were not daily advancing ingrowth, would be considered as perfectly incredible. It presents us with theprospect of a great nation, flourishing in arts, and arms, and commerce, andwith a government, which has generally been allowed to be the best, which hashitherto stood the test of experience, in any country, and yet the larger halfof the people reduced to the condition of paupers.2[60_VII__Plan_of_the_gradual_aboliti.html#id_1227]Greatly as we may be shocked at such a prospect, and ardently as we may wish toremove it, the evil is now so deeply seated, and the relief given by the poorlaws so widely extended, that no man of humanity could venture to propose theirimmediate abolition. To mitigate their effects, however, and stop their futureincrease, to which, if left to continue upon their present plan, we can see noprobable termination, it has been proposed to fix the whole sum to be raised, atits present rate, or any other that might be determined upon; and to make a lawthat on no account this sum should be exceeded. The objection to this plan is,that a very large sum would be still to be raised, and a great number of peopleto be supported; the consequence of which would be, that the poor would not beeasily able to distinguish the alteration that had been made. Each individualwould think that he had as good a right to be supported when he was in want, asany other person; and those who unfortunately chanced to be in distress when thefixed sum had been collected, would think themselves particularly ill used onbeing excluded from all assistance, while so many others were enjoying thisadvantage. If the sum collected, were divided among all that were in want,however their numbers might increase; though such a plan would be perfectlyfair, with regard to those who became dependent, after the sum had been fixed,it would undoubtedly be rather hard upon those, who had been in the habit ofreceiving a more liberal supply, and had done nothing to justify its being takenfrom them.I have reflected much on the subject of the poor laws, and hope, therefore, thatI shall be excused, in venturing to suggest a mode of their gradual abolition,to which, I confess, that at present I can see no material objection. Of this,indeed, I feel nearly convinced, that, should we ever become sufficientlysensible of the wide-spreading tyranny, dependence, indolence, and unhappiness,which they create, as seriously to make an effort to abolish them, we shall becompelled to adopt the principle, if not the plan, which I shall mention. Itseems impossible to get rid of so extensive a system of support, consistentlywith humanity, without applying ourselves directly to its vital principle, andendeavouring to counteract that deeply-seated cause, which occasions the rapidgrowth of all such establishments, and invariably renders them inadequate totheir object.To this end, I should propose a regulation to be made, declaring, that no childborn from any marriage, taking place after the expiration of a year from thedate of the law; and no illegitimate child born two years from the same date,should ever be entitled to parish assistance. And to give a more generalknowledge of this law, and to enforce it more strongly on the minds of the lowerclasses of people, the clergyman of each parish should, previously to thesolemnization of a marriage, read a short address to the parties, stating thestrong obligation on every man to support his own children; the impropriety, andeven immorality, of marrying without a fair prospect of being able to do this;the evils which had resulted to the poor themselves, from the attempt which hadbeen made to assist, by publick institutions, in a duty which ought to beexclusively appropriated to parents; and the absolute necessity which had atlength appeared, of abandoning all such institutions, on account of theirproducing effects totally opposite to those which were intended.This would operate as a fair, distinct, and precise notice, which no man couldwell mistake; and, without pressing hard on any particular individuals, would atonce throw off the rising generation from that miserable and helpless dependenceupon the government and the rich, the moral as well as physical consequences ofwhich are almost incalculable. When the poor are in the habit of constantlylooking to these sources, for all the good or evil they enjoy or suffer, theirminds must almost necessarily be under a continual state of irritation againstthe higher classes of society, whenever they feel distressed from the pressureof circumstances.I have often heard great surprise expressed that the poor in this country shouldbe with such difficulty persuaded to take to any substitutes during a period ofscarcity; but I confess, that this fact never surprised me in the least. Thepoor are told that the parish is obliged to provide for them. This, theynaturally conceive, is a rich source of supply; and when they are offered anykind of food to which they are not accustomed, they consider it as a breach ofobligation in the parish, and as proceeding, not from the hard law of necessityfrom which there is no appeal; but from the injustice and hardheartedness of thehigher classes of society, against which they would wish to appeal to the rightof the strongest. The language which they generally make use of upon theseoccasions, is, “See what stuff they want to make us eat, I wonder how they wouldlike it themselves. I should like to see some of them do a day’s work upon it.”The words they and them generally refer to the Parliament, the Lord Mayor, theJustices, the Parish, and in general to all the higher classes of society. Boththe irritation of mind and the helplessness in expedients, during the pressureof want, arise in this instance from the wretched system of governing too much.When the poor were once taught, by the abolition of the poor laws, and a properknowledge of their real situation, to depend more upon themselves, we might restsecure, that they would be fruitful enough in resources, and that the evilswhich were absolutely irremediable, they would bear with the fortitude of men,and the resignation of Christians.After the publick notice which I have proposed had been given, and the system ofpoor laws had ceased with regard to the rising generation, if any man chose tomarry, without a prospect of being able to support a family, he should have themost perfect liberty so to do. Though to marry, in this case, is in my opinionclearly an immoral act, yet it is not one, which society can justly take uponitself to prevent or punish; because the punishment provided for it by the lawsof nature, falls directly and most severely upon the individual who commits theact, and, through him, only more remotely and feebly on the society. When naturewill govern and punish for us, it is a very miserable ambition, to wish tosnatch the rod from her hands, and draw upon ourselves the odium of executioner.To the punishment, therefore, of nature he should be left, the punishment ofsevere want. He has erred in the face of a most clear and precise warning, andcan have no just reason to complain of any person but himself, when he feels theconsequences of his error. All parish assistance should be most rigidly deniedhim: and if the hand of private charity be stretched forth in his relief, theinterests of humanity imperiously require that it should be administered verysparingly. He should be taught to know that the laws of nature, which are thelaws of God, had doomed him and his family to starve for disobeying theirrepeated admonitions; that he had no claim of right on society for the smallestportion of food, beyond that which his labour would fairly purchase; and that,if he and his family were saved from suffering the utmost extremities of hunger,he would owe it to the pity of some kind benefactor, to whom, therefore, heought to be bound by the strongest ties of gratitude.If this system were pursued, we need be under no apprehensions whatever, thatthe number of persons in extreme want would be beyond the power and the will ofthe benevolent to supply. The sphere for the exercise of private charity would,I am confident, be less than it is present; and the only difficulty would be, torestrain the hand of benevolence from assisting those in distress in so liberala manner as to encourage indolence and want of foresight in others.With regard to illegitimate children, after the proper notice had been given,they should on no account whatever be allowed to have any claim to parishassistance. If the parents desert their child, they ought to be made answerablefor the crime. The infant is, comparatively speaking, of no value to thesociety, as others will immediately supply its place. Its principal value is onaccount of its being the object of one of the most delightful passions in humannature – parental affection. But if this value be disregarded, by those who arealone in a capacity to feel it, the society cannot be called upon to put itselfin their place; and has no further business in its protection, than in the caseof its murder or intentional ill-treatment to follow the general rules inpunishing such crimes; which rules, for the interests of morality, it is boundto pursue, whether the object, in the particular instance, be of value to thestate or not.At present the child is taken under the protection of the parish,3[60_VII__Plan_of_the_gradual_aboliti.html#id_1231] and generally dies, at leastin London, within the first year. The loss to the society, if it be one, is thesame; but the crime is diluted by the number of people concerned, and the deathpasses as a visitation of Providence, instead of being considered as thenecessary consequence of the conduct of its parents, for which they ought to beheld responsible to God and to society.The desertion of both parents, however, is not so common as the desertion ofone. When a servant or labouring man has an illegitimate child, his running awayis perfectly a matter of course; and it is by no means uncommon for a man with awife and large family to withdraw into a distant county, and leave them to theparish; indeed, I once heard a hard-working good sort of man propose to do this,as the best mode of providing for a wife and six children.4[60_VII__Plan_of_the_gradual_aboliti.html#id_1233] If the simple fact of thesefrequent desertions were related in some countries, a strange inference would bedrawn against the English character; but the wonder would cease when our publickinstitutions were explained.By the laws of nature, a child is confided directly and exclusively to theprotection of its parents. By the laws of nature, the mother of a child isconfided almost as strongly and exclusively to the man who is the father of it.If these ties were suffered to remain in the state in which nature has leftthem, and the man were convinced, that the woman and the child depended solelyupon him for support, I scarcely believe that there are ten men breathing soatrocious as to desert them. But our laws, in opposition to the laws of nature,say, that if the parents forsake their child, other persons will undertake tosupport it; or, if the man forsake the woman, she shall still meet withprotection elsewhere; that is, we take all possible pains to weaken and rendernull the ties of nature, and then say, that men are unnatural. But the fact is,that the society itself, in its body politick, is the unnatural character, forframing laws that thus counteract the laws of nature, and give premiums to theviolation of the best and most honourable feelings of the human heart.It is a common thing, in most parishes, when the father of an illegitimate childcan be seized, to endeavour to frighten him into marriage by the terrors of ajail; but such a proceeding cannot surely be too strongly reprobated. In thefirst place, it is a most shallow policy in the parish officers; for, if theysucceed, the effect, upon the present system, will generally be, the havingthree or four children to provide for, instead of one. And, in the next place,it is difficult to conceive a more gross and scandalous profanation of areligious ceremony. Those who believe that the character of the woman is salvedby such a forced engagement, or that the moral worth of the man is enhanced byaffirming a lie before God, have, I confess, very different ideas of delicacyand morality, from those which I have been taught to consider as just. If a mandeceive a woman into a connexion with him under a promise of marriage, he hasundoubtedly been guilty of a most atrocious act; and there are few crimes whichmerit a more severe punishment: but the last that I should choose is that whichwill oblige him to affirm another falsehood, which will probably render thewoman that he is to be joined to miserable, and will burden the society with afamily of paupers.The obligation on every man to support his children, whether legitimate orillegitimate, is so clear and strong, that it would be just to arm society withany power to enforce it, which would be likely to answer the purpose. But I aminclined to believe, that no exercise of the civil power, however rigorous,would be half so effectual, as a knowledge generally circulated, that childrenwere in future to depend solely for support upon their parents, and wouldperhaps starve if they were deserted.It may appear to be hard, that a mother and her children, who had been guilty ofno particular crime themselves, should suffer for the ill-conduct of the father;but this is one of the invariable laws of nature; and knowing this, we shouldthink twice upon the subject, and be very sure of the ground on which we go,before we presume systematically to counteract it.I have often heard the goodness of the Deity impeached on account of that partof the decalogue, in which he declares, that he will visit the sins of thefather upon the children; but the objection has not perhaps been sufficientlyconsidered. Without a most complete and fundamental change in the wholeconstitution of human nature; without making man an angel, or at least somethingtotally different from what he is at present; it seems absolutely, necessarythat such a law should prevail. Would it not require a perpetual miracle, whichis, perhaps, a contradiction in terms, to prevent children from being affectedin their moral and civil condition by the conduct of their parents? What man isthere that has been brought up by his parents, who is not, at the presentmoment, enjoying something from their virtues, or suffering something from theirvices; who, in his moral character, has not been elevated, in some degree, bytheir prudence, their justice, their benevolence, their temperance, or depressedby the contraries; who, in his civil condition, has not been raised by theirreputation, their foresight, their industry, their good fortune; or lowered bytheir want of character, their imprudence, their indolence, and their adversity?And how much does a knowledge of this transmission of blessings contribute toexcite and invigorate virtuous exertion? Proceeding upon this certainty, howardent and incessant are the efforts of parents to give their children a goodeducation, and to provide for their future situation in the world. If a mancould neglect or desert his wife and children, without their suffering anyinjury, how many individuals there are, who, not being very fond of their wives,or being tired of the shackles of matrimony, would withdraw from household caresand difficulties, and resume their liberty and independence as single men. Butthe consideration that children may suffer for the faults of their parents has astrong hold even upon vice, and many who are in such a state of mind, as todisregard the consequences of their habitual course of life, as far as relatesto themselves, are yet greatly anxious that their children should not sufferfrom their vices and follies. In the moral government of the world, it seemsevidently necessary, that the sins of the fathers should be visited upon thechildren; and if in our overweening vanity we imagine that we can govern aprivate society better by endeavouring systematically to counteract this law, Iam inclined to believe that we shall find ourselves very greatly mistaken.If the plan, which I have proposed, were adopted, the poors rates in a few yearswould begin very rapidly to decrease, and in no great length of time would becompletely extinguished; and yet, as far as it appears to me at present, noindividual would be either deceived or injured, and consequently no person couldhave a just right to complain.The abolition of the poor laws, however, is not of itself sufficient; and theobvious answer to those who lay too much stress upon this system, is, to desirethem to look at the state of the poor in some other countries, where such lawsdo not prevail, and to compare it with their condition in England. But thiscomparison, it must be acknowledged, is in many respects unfair; and would by nomeans decide the question of the utility, or inutility, of such a system.England possesses very great natural and political advantages, in which,perhaps, the countries that we should, in this case, compare with her, would befound to be palpably deficient. The nature of her soil and climate is such, thatthose almost universal failures in the crops of grain, which are known in somecountries, never occur in England. Her insular situation and extended commerceare peculiarly favourable for importation. Her numerous manufactures employ allthe hands that are not engaged in agriculture, and afford the means of a regulardistribution of the annual produce of the land and labour to the whole of herinhabitants. But above all, throughout a very large class of the people, adecided taste for the conveniencies and comforts of life, a strong desire ofbettering their condition, that master-spring of publick prosperity, and, inconsequence, a most laudable spirit of industry and foresight, are observed toprevail. These dispositions, so contrary to the hopeless indolence remarked indespotick countries, are probably generated, in great measure, by theconstitution of the English government, and the excellence of its laws, whichsecure to every individual the produce of his industry. When, therefore, on acomparison with other countries, England appears to have the advantage in thestate of her poor, the superiority is entirely to be attributed to thesefavourable circumstances, and not to the poor laws. A woman with one bad featuremay greatly excel in beauty some other who may have this individual featuretolerably good; but it would be rather strange, to assert, in consequence, thatthe superior beauty of the former was occasioned by this particular deformity.The poor laws have constantly tended, in the most powerful manner, to counteractthe natural and acquired advantages of this country. Fortunately, theseadvantages have been so considerable, that, though greatly weakened, they couldnot be entirely overcome; and to these advantages, and these alone, it is owing,that England has been able to bear up so long against this pernicious system. Iam so strongly of this opinion, that I do not think that any other country inthe world, except perhaps Holland before the revolution, could have acted uponit so completely, for the same period of time, without utter ruin.It has been proposed by some, to establish poor laws in Ireland; but, from thewretched and degraded state of the common people, and the total want of thatdecent pride, which in England prevents so many from having recourse to parishassistance, there is little reason to doubt, that, on the establishment of suchlaws, the whole of the landed property would very soon be absorbed, or thesystem be given up in despair.In Sweden, from the dearths which are not unfrequent, owing to the generalfailure of crops in an unpropitious climate, and the impossibility of greatimportations in a poor country, an attempt to establish a system of parochialrelief such as that in England, if it were not speedily abandoned from thephysical impossibility of executing it, would level the property of the kingdomfrom one end to the other, and convulse the social system in such a manner, asabsolutely to prevent it from recovering its former state on the return ofplenty.Even in France, with all her advantages of situation and climate, the tendencyto population is so great, and the want of foresight among the lower classes ofthe people so conspicuous, that if poor laws were established, the landedproperty would soon sink under the burden, and the wretchedness of the people atthe same time be increased. On these considerations the committee de Mendicitè,at the beginning of the revolution, very properly and judiciously rejected theestablishment of such a system which had been proposed.The exception of Holland, if it were an exception, would arise from veryparticular circumstances – her extensive foreign trade, and her numerouscolonial emigrations, compared with the smallness of her territory; and theextreme unhealthiness of a great part of the country, which occasions a muchgreater average mortality than is common in other states. These, I conceive,were the unobserved causes which principally contributed to render Holland sofamous for the management of her poor, and able to employ and support all whoapplied for relief.No part of Germany is sufficiently rich to support an extensive system ofparochial relief; but I am inclined to think, that, from the absence of it, thelower classes of the people in some parts of Germany, are in a better situationthan those of the same class in England. In, Switzerland, for the same reason,their condition, before the late troubles, was perhaps universally superior. Andin a journey through the dutchies of Holstein and Sleswick belonging to Denmark,the houses of the lower classes of people appeared to me to be neater andbetter, and, in general, there were fewer indications of poverty andwretchedness among them, than among the same ranks in this country.Even in Norway, notwithstanding the disadvantage of a severe and uncertainclimate, from the little that I saw in a few weeks residence in the country, andthe information that I could collect from others, I am inclined to think, thatthe poor were, on the average, better off than in England. Their houses andclothing were superior, and, though they had no white bread, they had much moremeat, fish, and milk, than our labourers; and I particularly remarked, that thefarmers’ boys were much stouter and healthier looking lads than those of thesame description in England. This degree of happiness, superior to what could beexpected from the soil and climate, arises almost exclusively from the degree inwhich the preventive check to population operates; and the establishment of asystem of poor laws which would destroy this check, would at once sink the lowerclasses of the people into a state of the most miserable poverty andwretchedness; would diminish their industry, and consequently the produce of theland and labour of the country; would weaken the resources of ingenuity in timesof scarcity; and ultimately involve the country in all the horrors of continualfamines.If, as in Ireland, and in Spain, and many of the southern countries, the peoplebe in so degraded a state, as to propagate their species like brutes, totallyregardless of consequences, it matters little, whether they have poor laws ornot. Misery in all its various forms must be the predominant check to theirincrease. Poor laws, indeed, will always tend to aggravate the evil, bydiminishing the general resources of the country, and, in such a state ofthings, could exist only for a very short time; but with, or without them, nostretch of human ingenuity and exertion could rescue the people from the mostextreme poverty and wretchedness.NOTES1 [60_VII__Plan_of_the_gradual_aboliti.html#id_1228].

VIII.Of the modes of correcting the prevailing opinions on the subject of Population.IT is not enough to abolish all the positive institutions which encouragepopulation; but we must endeavour, at the same time, to correct the prevailingopinions, which have the same, or perhaps even a more powerful, effect. Thismust necessarily be a work of time; and can only be done, by circulating justernotions on these subjects, in writings and conversation; and by endeavouring toimpress as strongly as possible on the publick mind, that it is not the duty ofman simply to propagate his species, but to propagate virtue and happiness; andthat, if he has not a tolerably fair prospect of doing this, he is by no meanscalled upon to leave descendants.The merits of the childless, and of those who have brought up large families,should be compared without prejudice, and their different influence on thegeneral happiness of society justly appreciated.The matron who has reared a family of ten or twelve children, and whose sons,perhaps, may be fighting the battles of their country, is apt to think thatsociety owes her much; and this imaginary debt, society is, in general, fullyinclined to acknowledge. But if the subject be fairly considered, and therespected matron weighed in the scales of justice against the neglected oldmaid, it is possible that the matron might kick the beam. She will appear ratherin the character of a monopolist, than of a great benefactor to the state. Ifshe had not married and had so many children, other members of the society mighthave enjoyed this satisfaction; and there is no particular reason for supposingthat her sons would fight better for their country than the sons of other women.She has therefore rather subtracted from, than added to, the happiness of theother parts of society. The old maid, on the contrary, has exalted others bydepressing herself. Her self-denial has made room for another marriage, withoutany additional distress; and she has not, like the generality of men, inavoiding one error, fallen into its opposite. She has really and trulycontributed more to the happiness of the rest of the society arising from thepleasures of marriage, than if she had entered in this union herself, and hadbesides portioned twenty maidens with a hundred pounds each; whose particularhappiness would have been balanced, either by an increase in the generaldifficulties of rearing children and getting employment, or by the necessity ofcelibacy in twenty other maidens somewhere else. Like the truly benevolent manin an irremediable scarcity, she has diminished her own consumption, instead ofraising up a few particular people, by pressing down the rest. On a faircomparison, therefore, she seems to have a better founded claim to the gratitudeof society than the matron. Whether we could always completely sympathize withthe motives of her conduct, has not much to do with the question. The particularmotive which influenced the matron to marry, was certainly not the good of hercountry. To refuse a proper tribute of respect to the old maid, because she wasnot directly influenced in her conduct by the desire of conferring on society acertain benefit, which, though it must undoubtedly exist, must necessarily be sodiffused as to be invisible to her, is in the highest degree impolitick andunjust. It is expecting a strain of virtue beyond humanity. If we never rewardany persons with our approbation, but those who are exclusively influenced bymotives of general benevolence, this powerful encouragement to good actions willnot be very often called into exercise.There are very few women who might not have married in some way or other. Theold maid, who has either never formed an attachment, or has been disappointed inthe object of it, has, under the circumstances in which she has been placed,conducted herself with the most perfect propriety; and has acted a much morevirtuous and honourable part in society, than those women who marry without aproper degree of love, or at least of esteem, for their husbands; a species ofimmorality which is not reprobated as it deserves.If, in comparisons of this kind, we should be compelled to acknowledge that, inconsidering the general tendency of population to increase beyond the means ofsubsistence, the conduct of the old maid had contributed more to the happinessof the society than that of the matron; it will surely appear, not only unjust,but strikingly impolitick, not to proportion our tribute of honour andestimation more fairly according to their respective merits. Though we shouldnot go so far as to reward single women with particular distinctions; yet theplainest principles of equity and policy require, that the respect which theymight claim from their personal character, should, in no way whatever, beimpeded by their particular situation; and that, with regard to rank,precedence, and the ceremonial attentions of society, they should be completelyon a level with married women.It is still however true, that the life of a married person with a family, is ofmore consequence to society than that of a single person; because, when there isa family of children already born, it is of the utmost importance, that theyshould be well taken care of, and well educated; and of this there is veryseldom so fair a probability when they have lost their parents. Our objectshould be merely to correct the prevailing opinions with regard to the duty ofmarriage; and, without positively discouraging it, to prevent any persons frombeing attracted, or driven into this state by the respect and honour which awaitthe married dame, and the neglect and inconveniences attendant on the singlewoman.It is perfectly absurd as well as unjust, that a giddy girl of sixteen should,because she is married, be considered by the forms of society as the protectorof women of thirty, should come first into the room, should be assigned thehighest place at table, and be the prominent figure to whom the attentions ofthe company are more particularly addressed. Those who believe that thesedistinctions, added to the very long confinement of single women to the parentalroof, and their being compelled, on all occasions, to occupy the back ground ofthe picture, have not an influence in impelling many young women into themarried state against their natural inclinations, and without a proper degree ofregard for their intended husbands, do not, as I conceive, reason with muchknowledge of human nature. And till these customs are changed, as far ascircumstances will admit, and the respect and liberty which women enjoy, aremade to depend more upon personal character and propriety of conduct, than upontheir situation as married or single; it must be acknowledged, that among thehigher ranks of life we encourage marriage by considerable premiums.It is not, however, among the higher ranks of society, that we have most reasonto apprehend the too great frequency of marriage. Though the circulation ofjuster notions on this subject might, even in this part of the community, domuch good, and prevent many unhappy marriages; yet, whether we make particularexertions for this purpose, or not, we may rest assured, that the degree ofproper pride, and spirit of independence, almost invariably connected witheducation and a certain rank in life, will secure the operation of thepreventive check to a considerable extent. All that the society can reasonablyrequire of its members is, that they should not have families without being ableto support them. This may be fairly enjoined as a solemn duty. Every restraintbeyond this, though in many points of view highly desirable, must be consideredas a matter of choice and taste; but, from what we already know of the habitswhich prevail among the higher ranks of life, we have reason to think, thatlittle more is wanted to attain the object required than to award a greaterdegree of respect and of personal liberty to single women, and to remove thedistinctions in favour of married women, so as to place them exactly upon alevel; a change which, independently of any particular purpose in view, theplainest principles of equity seem to demand.If, among the higher classes of society, the object of securing the operation ofthe preventive check to population to a sufficient degree, appear to beattainable without much difficulty; the obvious mode of proceeding with thelower classes of society, where the point is of the principal importance, is, toendeavour to infuse into them a portion of that knowledge and foresight, whichso much facilitates the attainment of this object in the educated part of thecommunity.The fairest chance of accomplishing this end, would probably be by theestablishment of a system of parochial education upon a plan similar to thatproposed by Dr. Smith.1 [61_VIII__Of_the_modes_of_correcting.html#id_1237] Inaddition to the usual subjects of instruction, and those which he has mentioned,I should be disposed to lay considerable stress on the frequent explanation ofthe real state of the lower classes of society, as affected by the principle ofpopulation, and their consequent dependence on themselves, for the chief part oftheir happiness, or misery. If, in the course of time, a few of the simplestprinciples of political economy could be added to these instructions, thebenefit to society would be almost incalculable.2[61_VIII__Of_the_modes_of_correcting.html#id_1235] In some conversations withlabouring men, during the late scarcities, I confess that I was to the lastdegree disheartened, at observing their inveterate prejudices on the subject ofgrain; and I felt very strongly the almost absolute incompatibility of agovernment really free, with such a degree of ignorance. The delusions are ofsuch a nature, that, if acted upon, they must, at all events, be repressed byforce; and it is extremely difficult to give such a power to the government aswill be sufficient at all times for this purpose, without the risk of its beingemployed improperly, and endangering the liberty of the subject. And thisreflection cannot but be disheartening to every friend to freedom.We have lavished immense sums on the poor, which we have every reason to thinkhave constantly tended to aggravate their misery. But in their education, and inthe circulation of those important political truths that most nearly concernthem, which are perhaps the only means in our power of really raising theircondition, and of making them happier men and more peaceable subjects, we havebeen miserably deficient. It is surely a great national disgrace, that theeducation of the lower classes of people in England should be left merely to afew sunday schools, supported by a subscription from individuals, who of coursecan give to the course of instruction in them, any kind of bias which theyplease. And even the improvement of sunday schools, for objectionable as theyare in some points of view, and imperfect in all, I cannot but consider them asan improvement, is of very late date.The arguments which have been urged against instructing the people, appear to meto be not only illiberal, but to the last degree feeble; and they ought, on thecontrary, to be extremely forcible, and to be supported by the most obvious andstriking necessity, to warrant us in withholding the means of raising thecondition of the lower classes of people, when they are in our power. Those whowill not listen to any answer to these arguments drawn from theory, cannot, Ithink, refuse the testimony of experience; and I would ask, whether theadvantage of superior instruction which the lower classes of people in Scotlandare known to possess, has appeared to have any tendency towards creating aspirit of tumult and discontent amongst them. And yet from the naturalinferiority of its soil and climate, the pressure of want is more constant, andthe dearths are not only more frequent, but more dreadful than in England. Inthe case of Scotland, the knowledge circulated among the common people, thoughnot sufficient essentially to better their condition by increasing, in anadequate degree, their habits of prudence and foresight; has yet the effect ofmaking them bear with patience the evils which they suffer, from being aware ofthe folly and inefficacy of turbulence. The quiet and peaceable habits of theinstructed Scotch peasant, compared with the turbulent disposition of theignorant Irishman, ought not to be without effect upon every impartial reasoner.The principal argument that I have heard advanced against a system of nationaleducation in England, is, that the common people would be put in a capacity toread such works as those of Paine, and that the consequences would probably befatal to government. But, on this subject, I agree most cordially with Dr. Smith3 [61_VIII__Of_the_modes_of_correcting.html#id_1239] in thinking, that aninstructed and well-informed people, would be much less likely to be led away byinflammatory writings, and would be much better able to detect the falsedeclamation of interested and ambitious demagogues, than an ignorant people. Oneor two readers in a parish are sufficient to circulate any quantity of sedition;and if these be gained to the democratic side, they will probably have the powerof doing much more mischief, by selecting the passages best suited to theirhearers, and choosing the moments when their oratory is likely to have the mosteffect; than if each individual in the parish had been in a capacity to read andjudge of the whole work himself; and, at the same time, to read and judge of theopposing arguments, which we may suppose would also reach him.But in addition to this, a double weight would undoubtedly be added to theobservation of Dr. Smith, if these schools were made the means of instructingthe people in the real nature of their situation; if they were taught, what isreally true, that, without an increase of their own industry and prudence, nochange of government could essentially better their condition; that though theymight get rid of some particular grievance, yet that, in the great point ofsupporting their families, they would be but little, or perhaps not at allbenefited; that a revolution would not alter in their favour the proportion ofthe supply of labour to the demand, or the quantity of food to the number of theconsumers; and that, if the supply of labour were greater than the demand, andthe demand for food greater than the supply, they might suffer the utmostseverity of want, under the freest, the most perfect, and best executedgovernment that the human imagination could conceive.A knowledge of these truths, so obviously tends to promote peace and quietness,to weaken the effect of inflammatory writings, and to prevent all unreasonableand ill-directed opposition to the constituted authorities, that those, whowould still object to the instruction of the people, may fairly be suspected ofa wish to encourage their ignorance, as a pretext for tyranny, and anopportunity of increasing the power and the influence of the executivegovernment.Besides correcting the prevailing opinions respecting marriage, and explainingthe real situation of the lower classes of society, as depending almost entirelyupon themselves for their happiness or misery; the parochial schools would, byearly instruction and the judicious distribution of rewards, have the fairestchance of training up the rising generation in habits of sobriety, industry,independence, and prudence, and in a proper discharge of their religious duties;which would raise them from their present degraded state, and approximate them,in some degree, to the middle classes of society, whose habits, generallyspeaking, are certainly superior.In most countries, among the lower classes of people, there appears to besomething like a standard of wretchedness, a point below which, they will notcontinue to marry and propagate their species. This standard is different indifferent countries, and is formed by various concurring circumstances of soil,climate, government, degree of knowledge, and civilization, &c. The principalcircumstances which contribute to raise it, are, liberty, security of property,the spread of knowledge, and a taste for the conveniences and the comforts oflife. Those which contribute principally to lower it are despotism andignorance.In an attempt to better the condition of the lower classes of society, ourobject should be to raise this standard as high as possible, by cultivating aspirit of independence, a decent pride, and a taste for cleanliness and comfortamong the poor. These habits would be best inculcated by a system of generaleducation and, when strongly fixed, would be the most powerful means ofpreventing their marrying with the prospect of being obliged to forfeit suchadvantages; and would consequently raise them nearer to the middle classes ofsociety.NOTES1 [61_VIII__Of_the_modes_of_correcting.html#id_1236]. Wealth of Nations, vol.iii. b. v. c. i. p. 187.2 [61_VIII__Of_the_modes_of_correcting.html#id_1234]. Dr. Smith proposes thatthe elementary parts of geometry and mechanics should be taught in these parishschools; and I cannot help thinking that the common principles by which marketsare regulated might be made sufficiently clear, to be of considerable use. It iscertainly a subject, that, as it interests the lower classes of people nearly,would be likely to attract their attention. At the same time, it must beconfessed, that it is impossible to be in any degree sanguine on this point,recollecting how very ignorant in general the educated part of the community isof these principles. If, however, political economy cannot be taught to thecommon people, I really think that it ought to form a branch of a universityeducation. Scotland has set us an example in this respect, which we ought not tobe so slow to imitate. It is of the very utmost importance, that the gentlemenof the country, and particularly the clergy, should not, from ignorance,aggravate the evils of scarcity every time that it unfortunately occurs. Duringthe late dearths, half of the gentlemen and clergymen in the kingdom richlydeserved to have been prosecuted for sedition. After inflaming the minds of thecommon people against the farmers and corn-dealers, by the manner in which theytalked of them, or preached about them, it was but a feeble antidote to thepoison which they had infused, coldly to observe, that however the poor might beoppressed or cheated, it was their duty to keep the peace. It was little betterthan Anthony’s repeated declaration, that the conspirators were all honourablemen; which did not save either their houses or their persons from the attacks ofthe mob. Political economy is perhaps the only science of which it may be said,that the ignorance of it is not merely a deprivation of good, but produces greatpositive evil.3 [61_VIII__Of_the_modes_of_correcting.html#id_1238].

IX.Of the direction of our charity.AN important and interesting inquiry yet remains, relating to the mode, by whichwe could direct our private charity, so as not to interfere with the greatobject in view, of ameliorating the condition of the lower classes of people, bypreventing the population from pressing too hard against the limits of the meansof subsistence.The emotion which prompts us to relieve our fellow-creatures in distress, islike all our other natural passions, general, and in some degree indiscriminateand blind. Our feelings of compassion may be worked up to a higher pitch by awell-wrought scene in a play, or a fictitious tale in a novel, than by almostany events in real life; and if, among ten petitioners, we were to listen onlyto the first impulses of our feelings, without making further inquiries, weshould undoubtedly give our assistance to the best actor of the party. It isevident, therefore, that the impulse of benevolence, like the impulses of love,of anger, of ambition, of eating and drinking, or any other of our naturalpropensities, must be regulated by experience, and frequently brought to thetest of utility, or it will defeat its intended purpose.The apparent object of the passion between the sexes is, the continuation of thespecies, and the formation of such an intimate union of views and interestsbetween two persons, as will best promote their happiness, and at the same timesecure the proper degree of attention to the helplessness of infancy and theeducation of the rising generation; but if every man were to obey at all timesthe impulses of nature in the gratification of this passion, without regard toconsequences, the principal part of the important objects would not be attained,and even the continuation of the species might be defeated by a promiscuousintercourse.The apparent end of the impulse of benevolence, is to draw the whole human racetogether, but more particularly that part of it which is of our own nation andkindred, in the bonds of brotherly love; and by giving men an interest in thehappiness and misery of their fellow creatures, to prompt them, as they havepower, to mitigate some of the partial evils arising from general laws, and thusto increase the sum of human happiness; but if our benevolence beindiscriminate, and the degree of apparent distress be made the sole measure ofour liberality, it is evident, that it will be exercised almost exclusively uponcommon beggars, while modest unobtrusive merit, struggling with unavoidabledifficulties, yet still maintaining some slight appearances of decency andcleanliness, will be totally neglected. We shall raise the worthless above theworthy; we shall encourage indolence and check industry; and, in the most markedmanner, subtract from the sum of human happiness.Our experience has, indeed, informed us, that the impulse of benevolence is notso strong as the passion between the sexes, and that, generally speaking, thereis much less danger to be apprehended from the indulgence of the former than ofthe latter; but, independently of this experience, and of the moral codesfounded upon it, a youth of eighteen would be as completely justified inindulging the sexual passion with every object capable of exciting it, as infollowing indiscriminately every impulse of his benevolence. They are bothnatural passions which are excited by their appropriate objects, and to thegratification of which, we are prompted by the pleasurable sensations whichaccompany them. As animals, or till we know their consequences, our onlybusiness is to follow these dictates of nature; but, as reasonable beings, weare under the strongest obligations to attend to their consequences; and if theybe evil to ourselves or others, we may justly consider it as an indication thatsuch a mode of indulging these passions is not suited to our state, orconformable to the will of God. As moral agents, therefore, it is clearly ourduty to restrain their indulgence in these particular directions; and by thuscarefully examining the consequences of our natural passions, and frequentlybringing them to the test of utility, gradually to acquire a habit of gratifyingthem, only in that way, which, being unattended with evil, will clearly add tothe sum of human happiness, and fulfil the apparent purpose of the Creator.Though utility, therefore, can never be the immediate excitement to thegratification of any passion, it is the test by which alone we can know, whetherit ought, or ought not, to be indulged; and is, therefore, the surest foundationof all morality which can be collected from the light of nature. All the moralcodes which have inculcated the subjection of the passions to reason, have been,as I conceive, really built upon this foundation, whether the promulgators ofthem were aware of it or not.I remind the reader of these truths, in order to apply them to the habitualdirection of our charity; and, if we keep the criterion of utility constantly inview, we may find ample room for the exercise of our benevolence, withoutinterfering with the great purpose which we have to accomplish.One of the most valuable parts of charity, is its effect upon the giver. It ismore blessed to give than to receive. Supposing it to be allowed, that theexercise of our benevolence in acts of charity is not, upon the whole, reallybeneficial to the poor, yet we could never sanction any endeavour to extinguishan impulse, the proper gratification of which has so evident a tendency topurify and exalt the human mind. But it is particularly satisfactory andpleasing to find, that the mode of exercising our charity, which, when broughtto the test of utility, will appear to be most beneficial to the poor, isprecisely that, which will have the best and most improving effect on the mindof the donor.The quality of charity like that of mercy,“is not strained;It droppeth as the gentle rain from heavenUpon the earth beneath.”The immense sums distributed to the poor, in this country, by the parochiallaws, are improperly called charity. They want its most distinguishingattribute; and, as it might be expected, from an attempt to force that whichloses its essence the moment that it ceases to be voluntary, their effect uponthose from whom they are collected are as prejudicial, as on those to whom theyare distributed. On the side of the receivers of this miscalled charity, insteadof real relief, we find accumulated distress and more extended poverty; on theside of the givers, instead of pleasurable sensations, unceasing discontent andirritation.In the great charitable institutions supported by voluntary contributions, manyof which are certainly of a prejudicial tendency, the subscriptions, I aminclined to fear, are sometimes given grudgingly, and rather because they areexpected by the world from certain stations, and certain fortunes, than becausethey are prompted by motives of genuine benevolence; and as the greater part ofthe subscribers do not interest themselves in the management of the funds, or inthe fate of the particular objects relieved, it is not to be expected that thiskind of charity should have any strikingly beneficial influence on the minds ofthe majority who exercise it.Even in the relief of common beggars, we shall find that we are more frequentlyinfluenced by the desire of getting rid of the importunities of a disgustingobject, than by the pleasure of relieving it. We wish that it had not fallen inour way, rather than rejoice in the opportunity given us of assisting afellow-creature. We feel a painful emotion at the sight of so much apparentmisery; but the pittance we give does not relieve it. We know that it is totallyinadequate to produce any essential effect. We know, besides, that we shall beaddressed in the same manner at the corner of the next street; and we know thatwe are liable to the grossest impostures. We hurry, therefore, sometimes bythem, and shut our ears to their importunate demands. We give no more than wecan help giving without doing actual violence to our feelings. Our charity is insome degree forced, and, like forced charity, it leaves no satisfactoryimpression on the mind, and cannot, therefore, have any very beneficial andimproving effect on the heart and affections.But it is far otherwise with that voluntary and active charity, which makesitself acquainted with the objects which it relieves; which seems to feel, andto be proud of, the bond which unites the rich with the poor; which enters intotheir houses; informs itself not only of their wants, but of their habits anddispositions; checks the hopes of clamorous and obtrusive poverty, with no otherrecommendation but rags; and encourages with adequate relief the silent andretiring sufferer, labouring under unmerited difficulties. This mode ofexercising our charity presents a very different picture from that of any other;and its contrast with the common mode of parish relief, cannot be betterdescribed than in the words of Mr. Townsend, in the conclusion of his admirabledissertation on the Poor Laws: “Nothing in nature can be more disgusting than aparish pay-table, attendant upon which, in the same objects of misery, are toooften found combined, snuff, gin, rags, vermin, insolence, and abusive language;nor in nature, can any thing be more beautiful than the mild complacency ofbenevolence hastening to the humble cottage to relieve the wants of industry andvirtue, to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, and to soothe the sorrows ofthe widow with her tender orphans; nothing can be more pleasing, unless it betheir sparkling eyes, their bursting tears, and their uplifted hands, theartless expressions of unfeigned gratitude for unexpected favours. Such sceneswill frequently occur whenever men shall have power to dispose of their ownproperty.”I conceive it to be almost impossible, that any person could be much engaged insuch scenes without daily making advances in virtue. No exercise of ouraffections can have a more evident tendency to purify and exalt the human mind.It is almost exclusively this species of charity that blesseth him that gives;and, in a general view, it is almost exclusively this species of charity whichblesseth him that takes; at least it may be asserted, that there is no othermode of exercising our charity, in which large sums can be distributed without agreater chance of producing evil than good.The discretionary power of giving or withholding relief, which is, to a certainextent, vested in parish officers and justices, is of a very different nature,and will have a very different effect, from the discrimination which may beexercised by voluntary charity. Every man in this country, under certaincircumstances, is entitled by law to parish assistance; and unless hisdisqualification be clearly proved, has a right to complain if it be withheld.The inquiries necessary to settle this point, and also the extent of the reliefto be granted, too often produce evasion and lying on the part of thepetitioner, and afford an opening to partiality and oppression in the overseer.If the proposed relief be given, it is of course received with unthankfulness;and if it be denied, the party generally thinks himself severely aggrieved, andfeels resentment and indignation at his treatment.In the distribution of voluntary charity, nothing of this kind can take place.The person who receives it, is made the proper subject of the pleasurablesensation of gratitude; and those who do not receive it, cannot possiblyconceive themselves, in the slightest degree, injured. Every man has a right todo what he will with his own; and cannot, in justice, be called upon to render areason why he gives in the one case, and abstains from it in the other. Thiskind of despotic power, essential to voluntary charity, gives the greatestfacility to the selection of worthy objects of relief, without being accompaniedby any ill consequences; and has further a most beneficial effect from thedegree of uncertainty which must necessarily be attached to it. It is, in thehighest degree, important to the general happiness of the poor, that no manshould look to charity, as a fund on which he may confidently depend. He shouldbe taught that his own exertions, his own industry and foresight, were his onlyjust ground of dependence; that if these failed, assistance in his distressescould only be the subject of rational hope; and that even the foundation of thishope must be in his own good conduct, and the consciousness that he had notinvolved himself in these difficulties by his indolence or imprudence.That, in the distribution of our charity, we are under a strong moral obligationto inculcate this lesson on the poor, by a proper discrimination, is a truth, ofwhich I cannot feel a doubt. If all could be completely relieved, and povertybanished from the country, even at the expence of three-fourths of the fortunesof the rich, I would be the last to say a single syllable against relieving all,and making the degree of distress alone the measure of our bounty. But asexperience has proved, I believe without a single exception, that poverty andmisery have always increased in proportion to the quantity of indiscriminatecharity; are we not bound to infer, reasoning as we usually do from the laws ofnature, that it is an intimation, that such a mode of distribution is not theproper office of benevolence.The laws of nature say, with St. Paul, “If a man will not work, neither shall heeat.” They also say, that he is not rashly to trust to Providence. They appearindeed to be constant and uniform for the express purpose of telling him what heis to trust to, and that if he marry, without being able to support a family, hemust expect severe want. These intimations appear from the constitution of humannature to be absolutely necessary, and to have a strikingly beneficial tendency.If in the direction either of our publick or our private charity, we say, thatthough a man will not work, yet he shall eat; and though he marry, without beingable to support a family, yet his family shall be supported; it is evident thatwe do not merely endeavour to mitigate some of the partial evils arising fromgeneral laws, but regularly and systematically to counteract the obviouslybeneficial effects of these general laws themselves. And we cannot easilyconceive, that the Deity should implant any passion in the human breast for sucha purpose.In the great course of human events, the best-founded expectations willsometimes be disappointed; and industry, prudence, and virtue, not only fail oftheir just reward, but be involved in unmerited calamities. Those who are thussuffering in spite of the best directed endeavours to avoid it, and from causeswhich they could not be expected to foresee, are the genuine objects of charity.In relieving these, we exercise the appropriate office of benevolence, that ofmitigating some of the partial evils arising from general laws; and in thisdirection of our charity, therefore, we need not apprehend any ill consequences.Such objects ought to be relieved according to our means liberally andadequately, even though the worthless were starving.When indeed, this first claim on our benevolence was satisfied, we might thenturn our attention to the idle and improvident: but the interests of humanhappiness most clearly require, that the relief which we afford them should bevery scanty. We may perhaps take upon ourselves, with great caution, tomitigate, in some degree, the punishments which they are suffering from the lawsof nature; but on no account to remove them entirely. They are deservedly at thebottom, in the scale of society; and, if we raise them from this situation, wenot only palpably defeat the end of benevolence, but commit a most glaringinjustice to those who are above them. They should on no account be enabled tocommand so much of the necessaries of life, as can be obtained by the worst-paidcommon labour. The brownest bread, with the coarsest and scantiest apparel, isthe utmost which they should have the means of purchasing.It is evident that these reasonings do not apply to those cases of urgentdistress arising from disastrous accidents, unconnected with habits of indolenceand improvidence. If a man break a leg or an arm, we are not to stop to inquireinto his moral character before we lend him our assistance; but in this case weare perfectly consistent, and the touchstone of utility completely justifies ourconduct. By affording the most indiscriminate assistance in this way, we are inlittle danger of encouraging people to break their arms and legs, According tothe touchstone of utility, the high approbation which Christ gave to the conductof the good Samaritan, who followed the immediate impulse of his benevolence inrelieving a stranger, in the urgent distress of an accident, does not, in thesmallest degree, contradict the expressions of St. Paul, “If a man will notwork, neither shall he eat.”We are not, however, in any case, to lose a present opportunity of doing good,from the mere supposition that we may possibly meet with a worthier object. Inall doubtful cases, it may safely be laid down as our duty, to follow thenatural impulse of our benevolence; but when, in fulfilling our obligation asreasonable beings, to attend to the consequences of our actions, we have, fromour own experience and that of others, drawn the conclusion, that the exerciseof our benevolence in one mode is prejudicial, and in another is beneficial, inits effects, we are certainly bound, as moral agents, to check our naturalpropensities in the one direction, and to encourage them, and acquire the habitsof exercising them, in the other."},{"pageContent":"CHAP. X.Of the errors in different plans which have been proposed, to improve thecondition of the Poor.IN the distribution of our charity, or in any efforts which we may make tobetter the condition of the lower classes of society, there is another pointrelating to the main argument of this work, to which we must be particularlyattentive. We must on no account do any thing, which tends directly to encouragemarriage; or to remove, in any regular and systematic manner, that inequality ofcircumstances, which ought always to exist between the single man and the manwith a family. The writers who have best understood the principle of population,appear to me all to have fallen into very important errors on this point.Sir James Steuart, who is fully aware of what he calls vicious procreation, andof the misery that attends a redundant population, recommends, notwithstanding,the general establishment of foundling hospitals; the taking of children, undercertain circumstances, from their parents, and supporting them at the expence ofthe state; and particularly laments the inequality of condition between themarried and single man, so ill-proportioned to their respective wants.1[63_X__Of_the_errors_in_different_pl.html#id_1241] He forgets, in theseinstances, that if, without the encouragement to multiplication, of foundlinghospitals, or of publick support for the children of some married persons; andunder the discouragement of great pecuniary disadvantages on the side of themarried man, population be still redundant; which is evinced by the inability ofthe poor to maintain all their children; it is a clear proof, that the fundsdestined for the maintenance of labour cannot properly support a greaterpopulation; and that, if further, encouragements to multiplication be given, anddiscouragements removed, the result must be, an increase, somewhere or other, ofthat vicious procreation which he so justly reprobates.Mr. Townsend, who, in his dissertation on the Poor Laws, has treated thissubject with great skill and perspicuity, appears to me to conclude with aproposal, which violates the principles on which he had reasoned so well. Hewishes to make the benefit clubs, or friendly societies, which are nowvoluntarily established in many parishes, compulsory and universal; andproposes, as a regulation, that an unmarried man should pay a fourth part of hiswages, and a married man with four children, not more than a thirtieth part.2[63_X__Of_the_errors_in_different_pl.html#id_1243]I must first remark, that the moment these subscriptions are made compulsory,they will necessarily operate exactly like a direct tax upon labour, which, asDr. Smith justly states, will always be paid, and in a more expensive manner, bythe consumer. The landed interest, therefore, would receive no relief from thisplan, but would pay the same sum as at present, only in the advanced price oflabour and of commodities, instead of in the parish rates. A compulsorysubscription of this kind, would have almost all the ill effects of the presentsystem of relief, and, though altered in name, would still possess the essentialspirit of the poor laws.Dean Tucker, in some remarks on a plan of the same kind, proposed by Mr. Pew,observed, that, after much talk and reflection on the subject, he had come tothe conclusion, that they must be voluntary associations, and not compulsoryassemblies. A voluntary subscription is like a tax upon a luxury, and does notnecessarily raise the price of labour.It should be recollected also, that in a voluntary association of a smallextent, over which each individual member can exercise a superintendence, it ishighly probable, that the original agreements will all be strictly fulfilled, orif they be not, every man may, at least, have the redress of withdrawing himselffrom the club. But in an universal compulsory subscription, which mustnecessarily become a national concern, there would be no security whatever forthe fulfilment of the original agreements; and when the funds failed, which theycertainly would do, when all the idle and dissolute were included, instead ofsome of the most industrious and provident, as at present, a larger subscriptionwould probably be demanded, and no man would have the right to refuse it. Theevil would thus go on increasing as the poor rates do now. If, indeed, theassistance given were always specific, and on no account to be increased, as inthe present voluntary associations, this would certainly be a strikingadvantage; but the same advantage might be completely attained by a similardistribution of the sums collected by the parish rates. On the whole, therefore,it appears to me, that, if the friendly societies were made universal andcompulsory, it would be merely a different mode of collecting parish rates; andany particular mode of distribution, might be as well adopted upon one system asupon the other.With regard to the proposal of making single men pay a fourth part of theirearnings weekly, and married men with families only a thirtieth part, it wouldevidently operate as a heavy fine upon bachelors, and a high bounty uponchildren; and is therefore directly adverse to the general spirit in which Mr.Townsend’s excellent dissertation is written. Before he introduces thisproposal, he lays it down as a general principle, that no system for the reliefof the poor can be good, which does not regulate population by the demand forlabour,3 [63_X__Of_the_errors_in_different_pl.html#id_1245] but this proposalclearly tends to encourage population without any reference to the demand forlabour, and punishes a young man for his prudence in refraining from marriage ata time, perhaps, when this demand is so small, that the wages of labour aretotally inadequate to the support of a family. I should be averse to anycompulsory system whatever for the poor; but, certainly, if single men werecompelled to pay a contribution for the future contingencies of the marriedstate, they ought, in justice, to receive a benefit, proportioned to the periodof their privation; and the man who had contributed a fourth of his earnings formerely one year, ought not to be put upon a level with him who has contributedthis proportion for ten years.Arthur Young, in most of his works, appears clearly to understand the principleof population, and is fully aware of the evils which must necessarily resultfrom an increase of people beyond the demand of labour, and the means ofcomfortable subsistence. In his tour through France, he has particularlylaboured this point, and shewn most forcibly the misery, which results, in thatcountry, from the excess of population occasioned by the too great division ofproperty. Such an increase, he justly calls, merely a multiplication ofwretchedness. “Couples marry and procreate on the idea, not the reality, of amaintenance; they increase beyond the demand of towns and manufactures; and theconsequence is, distress, and numbers dying of diseases arising frominsufficient nourishment.”4 [63_X__Of_the_errors_in_different_pl.html#id_2213]In another place he quotes a very sensible passage from the report of thecommittee of mendicity, which, alluding to the evils of overpopulation,concludes thus, “Il faudroit enfin necessairement que le prix de travailbais-sat par la plus grand concurrence de travailleurs, d’ou resulteroit unindigence complette pour ceux qui ne trouveroient pas de travail, et unesubsistence incomplette pour ceux mêmes aux quels il ne seroit pas refusé.” Andin remarking upon this passage, he observes, “France itself affords anirrefragable proof of the truth of these sentiments; for, I am clearly ofopinion, from the observations I made in every province of the kingdom, that herpopulation is so much beyond the proportion of her industry and labour, that shewould be much more powerful and infinitely more flourishing, if she had five orsix millions less of inhabitants. From her too great population, she presents,in every quarter, such spectacles of wretchedness, as are absolutelyinconsistent with that degree of national felicity, which she was capable ofattaining, even under the old government. A traveller, much less attentive thanI was to objects of this kind, must see at every turn most unequivocal signs ofdistress. That these should exist, no one can wonder, who considers the price oflabour and of provisions, and the misery into which a small rise in the price ofwheat throws the lower classes.”5[63_X__Of_the_errors_in_different_pl.html#id_1247]“If you would see,” he says, a district with as little distress in it as isconsistent with the political system of the old government of France, you mustassuredly go where there are no little properties at all. You must visit thegreat farms in Beauce, Picardy, part of Normandy, and Artois, and there you willfind no more population than what is regularly employed and regularly paid; andif in such districts, you should, contrary to this rule, meet with muchdistress, it is twenty to one, but that it is in a parish which has somecommons, which tempt the poor to have cattle – to have property – and inconsequence misery. When you are engaged in this political tour, finish it byseeing England, and I will shew you a set of peasants well clothed, wellnourished, tolerably drunken from superfluity, well lodged, and at their ease;and yet, amongst them, not one in a thousand has either land or cattle.”6[63_X__Of_the_errors_in_different_pl.html#id_2215] A little further on, alludingto encouragements to marriage, he says of France; “the predominant evil of thekingdom is the having so great a population, that she can neither employ norfeed it; why then encourage marriage? would you breed more people, because youhave more already than you know what to do with? you have so great a competitionfor food, that your people are starving or in misery; and you would encouragethe production of more to encrease that competition. It may almost be questionedwhether the contrary policy ought not to be embraced? whether difficultiesshould not be laid on the marriage of those who cannot make it appear that theyhave the prospect of maintaining the children that shall be the fruit of it? Butwhy encourage marriages which are sure to take place in all situations in whichthey ought to take place? There is no instance to be found of plenty of regularemployment being first established where marriages have not followed in aproportionate degree. The policy therefore, at best, is useless, and may bepernicious.”After having once so clearly understood the principle of population as toexpress these and many other sentiments on the subject, equally just andimportant, it is not a little surprising to find Mr. Young in a pamphlet,intitled, The Question of Scarcity plainly stated, and Remedies considered,(published in 1800), observing, that “the means which would of all othersperhaps tend most surely to prevent future scarcities so oppressive to the pooras the present, would be to secure to every country labourer in the kingdom,that has three children and upwards, half an acre of land for potatoes, andgrass enough to feed one or two cows.7[63_X__Of_the_errors_in_different_pl.html#id_1249] * * * * If each had his amplepotatoe ground and a cow, the price of wheat would be of little more consequenceto them, than it is to their brethren in Ireland.”“Every one admits the system to be good, but the question is, how to enforceit.”I was by no means aware, that the excellence of the system had been so generallyadmitted. For myself I strongly protest against being included in the generalterm of every one, as I should consider the adoption of this system, as the mostcruel and fatal blow to the happiness of the lower classes of people in thiscountry, that they had ever received.Mr. Young, however, goes on to say, that, “The magnitude of the object shouldmake us disregard any difficulties, but such as are insuperable: none such wouldprobably occur if something like the following means were resorted to:”“I. Where there are common pastures, to give to a labouring man having children,a right to demand an allotment proportioned to the family, to be set out by theparish officers, &c. * * * and a cow bought. Such labourer to have both forlife, paying 40s. a year till the price of the cow, &c. was reimbursed: at hisdeath to go to the labourer having the most numerous family, for life, payingshillings a week to the widow of his predecessor.”“II. Labourers thus demanding allotments by reason of their families to haveland assigned, and cows bought, till the proportion so allotted amounts to oneof the extent of the common.”“III. In parishes where there are no commons, and the quality of the landadequate, every cottager having children, to whose cottage there is not within agiven time land sufficient for a cow, and half an acre of potatoes, assigned ata fair average rent, subject to appeal to the sessions, to have a right todemand shillings per week of the parish for every child, till such land beassigned; leaving to landlords and tenants the means of doing it. Cows to befound by the parish, under an annual reimbursement.” 8[63_X__Of_the_errors_in_different_pl.html#id_2217]“The great object is, by means of milk and potatoes, to take the mass of thecountry poor from the consumption of wheat, and to give them substitutes equallywholesome and nourishing, and as independent of scarcities, natural andartificial, as the providence of the Almighty will admit.” 9[63_X__Of_the_errors_in_different_pl.html#id_1251]Would not this plan operate, in the most direct manner, as an encouragement tomarriage and bounty on children, which Mr. Young has with so much justicereprobated in his travels in France? and does he seriously think that it wouldbe an eligible thing, to feed the mass of the people in this country on milk andpotatoes, and make them as independent of the price of corn, and of the demandfor labour, as their brethren in Ireland?The specifick cause of the poverty and misery of the lower classes of people inFrance and Ireland, is, that, from the extreme subdivision of property in theone country, and the facility of obtaining a potatoe ground in the other, apopulation is brought into existence, which is not demanded by the quantity ofcapital and employment in the country; and the consequence of which must,therefore, necessarily be, as is very justly expressed in the report of thecommittee of mendicity before mentioned, to lower in general the price of labourby too great competition; from which must result complete indigence to those whocannot find employment, and an incomplete subsistence even to those who can.The obvious tendency of Mr. Young’s plan, is, by encouraging marriage andfurnishing a cheap food, independent of the price of corn, and, of course, ofthe demand for labour, to place the lower classes of people exactly in thissituation.It may perhaps be said, that our poor laws, at present, regularly encouragemarriage and children, by distributing relief in proportion to the size offamilies; and that this plan, which is proposed as a substitute, would merely dothe same thing in a less objectionable manner. But surely, in endeavouring toget rid of the evil of the poor laws, we ought not to retain their mostpernicious quality: and Mr. Young must know, as well as I do, that the principalreason why poor laws have invariably been found ineffectual in the relief of thepoor, is, that they tend to encourage a population which is not regulated by thedemand for labour. Mr. Young himself, indeed, expressly takes notice of thiseffect in England, and observes, that notwithstanding the unrivalled prosperityof her manufactures, “population is sometimes too active, as we see clearly bythe dangerous increase of poor’s rates in country villages.”10[63_X__Of_the_errors_in_different_pl.html#id_2219]But the fact is, that Mr. Young’s plan would be incomparably more powerful inencouraging a population beyond the demand for labour, than our present poorlaws. A laudable repugnance to the receiving of parish relief, arising partlyfrom a spirit of independence not yet extinct, and partly, from the disagreeablemode in which the relief is given, undoubtedly deters many from marrying with acertainty of falling on the parish; and the proportion of marriages to the wholepopulation, which has before been noticed, clearly proves that the poor laws,though they have undoubtedly a considerable influence in this respect, do notencourage marriage so much as might be expected from theory. But the case wouldbe very different, if, when a labourer had an early marriage in contemplation,the terrific forms of workhouses and parish officers, which might disturb hisresolution, were to be exchanged for the fascinating visions of land and cows.If the love of property, as Mr. Young has repeatedly said, will make a man domuch, it would be rather strange if it would not make him marry; an action towhich, it appears from experience, that he is by no means disinclined.The population which would be thus called into being, would be supported by theextended cultivation of potatoes, and would of course go on without anyreference to the demand for labour. In the present state of things,notwithstanding the flourishing condition of our manufactures, and the numerouschecks to our population, there is no practical problem so difficult as to findemployment for the poor; but this difficulty would evidently be aggravated ahundred fold, under the circumstances here supposed.In Ireland, or in any other country, where the common food is potatoes, andevery man who wishes to marry may obtain a piece of ground, sufficient, whenplanted with this root, to support a family, prizes may be given till thetreasury is exhausted, for essays on the best means of employing the poor; buttill some stop to the progress of population, naturally arising from this stateof things, take place, the object in view is really a physical impossibility.11[63_X__Of_the_errors_in_different_pl.html#id_1253]Mr. Young has intimated, that if the people were fed upon milk and potatoes,they would be more independent of scarcities than at present; but why thisshould be the case I really cannot comprehend. Undoubtedly, people who live uponpotatoes will not be much affected by a scarcity of wheat; but is there anycontradiction in the supposition of a failure in the crops of potatoes? Ibelieve it is generally understood, that they are more liable to suffer damageduring the winter than grain. From the much greater quantity of food, yielded bya given piece of land, when planted with potatoes, than under any other kind ofcultivation, it would naturally happen, that, for some time after theintroduction of this root, as the general food of the lower classes of people, agreater quantity would be grown than was demanded, and they would live inplenty. Mr. Young, in his travels through France, observes, that, “In districtswhich contain immense quantities of waste land of a certain degree of fertility,as in the roots of the Pyrenees, belonging to communities ready to sell them,economy and industry, animated with the views of settling and marrying, flourishgreatly; in such neighbourhoods something like an American increase takes place,and, if the land be cheap, little distress is found. But as procreation goes onrapidly under such circumstances, the least check to subsistence is attendedwith great misery; as wastes becoming dearer, or the best portions being sold,or difficulties arising in the acquisition; all which circumstances I met within those mountains. The moment that any impediment happens the distress of suchpeople will be proportioned to the activity and vigour which had animatedpopulation.”12 [63_X__Of_the_errors_in_different_pl.html#id_1255]This description will apply exactly to what would take place in this country, onthe distribution of small portions of land to the common people, and theintroduction of potatoes as their general food. For a time, the change mightappear beneficial, and, of course, the idea of property would make it, at first,highly acceptable to the poor; but as Mr. Young, in another place, says, “Youpresently arrive at the limit, beyond which, the earth, cultivate it as youplease, will feed no more mouths; yet those simple manners which instigate tomarriage still continue; what then is the consequence but the most dreadfulmisery imaginable?”13 [63_X__Of_the_errors_in_different_pl.html#id_2221]When the commons were all divided and difficulties began to occur in procuringpotatoe grounds, the habit of early marriages which had been introduced, wouldoccasion the most complicated distress; and when, from the increasingpopulation, and diminishing sources of subsistence, the average growth ofpotatoes was not more than the average consumption, a scarcity of potatoes wouldbe, in every respect, as probable, as a scarcity of wheat at present, and whenit did arrive, it would be, beyond all comparison, more dreadful.When the common people of a country live principally upon the dearest grain, asthey do in England on wheat, they have great resources in a scarcity; andbarley, oats, rice, cheap soups, and potatoes, all present themselves as lessexpensive, yet, at the same time, wholesome means of nourishment; but when theirhabitual food is the lowest in this scale, they appear to be absolutely withoutresource, except in the bark of trees, like the poor Swedes; and a great portionof them must necessarily be starved. Wheaten bread, roast beef, and turbot,which might not fail at the same time, are indeed, in themselves,unexceptionable substitutes for potatoes, and would probably be accepted assuch, without murmuring by the common people; but the misfortune is, that alarge population which had been habitually supported by milk and potatoes, wouldfind it difficult to obtain these substitutes in sufficient quantities, even ifthe whole benevolence of the kingdom were called into action for the purpose.The wages of labour will always be regulated by the proportion of the supply tothe demand. And as, upon the potatoe system, a supply more than adequate to thedemand would very soon take place, and this supply might be continued at a verycheap rate, on account of the cheapness of the food which would furnish it, thecommon price of labour would soon be regulated principally by the price ofpotatoes, instead of the price of wheat, as at present; and the rags andwretched cabins of Ireland would follow of course.When the demand for labour occasionally exceeds the supply, and wages areregulated by the price of the dearest grain, they will generally be such as toyield something besides mere food, and the common people may be able to obtaindecent houses and decent clothing. If the contrast between the state of theFrench and English labourers which Mr. Young has drawn, be in any degree nearthe truth, the advantage on the side of England has been occasioned, preciselyand exclusively, by these two circumstances; and if, by the adoption of milk andpotatoes as the general food of the common people, these circumstances weretotally altered, so as to make the supply of labour constantly in a great excessabove the demand for it, and regulate wages by the price of the cheapest food,the advantage would be immediately lost, and no efforts of benevolence couldprevent the most general and abject poverty.Upon the same principle, it would by no means be eligible that the cheap soupsof Count Rumford should be adopted as the general food of the common people.They are excellent inventions for publick institutions, and as occasionalresources; but if they were once universally adopted by the poor, it would beimpossible to prevent the price of labour from being regulated by them; and thelabourer, though at first he might have more to spare for other expences,besides food, would ultimately have much less to spare than before.The desirable thing, with a view to the happiness of the common people, seems tobe, that their habitual food should be dear, and their wages regulated by it;but that, in a scarcity, or other occasional distress, the cheaper food shouldbe readily and cheerfully adopted.14[63_X__Of_the_errors_in_different_pl.html#id_1261] With a view of rendering thistransition easier, and at the same time of making a useful distinction betweenthese who are dependent on parish relief, and those who are not, I should thinkthat one plan which Mr. Young proposes, would be extremely eligible. This is “topass an act prohibiting relief, so far as subsistence is concerned, in any othermanner than by potatoes, rice, and soup, not merely as a measure of the moment,but permanently.”15 [63_X__Of_the_errors_in_different_pl.html#id_1259] I do notthink that this plan would necessarily introduce these articles as the commonfood of the lower classes; and if it merely made the transition to them inperiods of distress easier, and, at the same time, drew a more marked line thanat present, between dependence and independence, it would have a very beneficialeffect.As it is acknowledged that the introduction of milk and potatoes, or of cheapsoups, as the general food of the lower classes of people, would lower the priceof labour, perhaps some cold politician might propose to adopt the system, witha view of underselling foreigners in the markets of Europe. I should not envythe feelings which could suggest such a proposal. I really cannot conceive anything much more detestable than the idea of knowingly condemning the labourersof this country to the rags and wretched cabins of Ireland, for the purpose ofselling a few more broadcloths and calicoes.16[63_X__Of_the_errors_in_different_pl.html#id_1257] The wealth and power ofnations are, after all, only desirable as they contribute to happiness. In thispoint of view, I should be very far from undervaluing them, considering them, ingeneral, as absolutely necessary means to attain the end; but if any particularcase should occur, in which they appeared to be in direct opposition to eachother, we cannot rationally doubt which ought to be postponed.Fortunately, however, even on the narrowest political principles, the adoptionof such a system would not answer. It has always been observed, that those whowork chiefly on their own property, work very indolently and unwillingly whenemployed for others; and it must necessarily happen, when, from the generaladoption of a very cheap food, the population of a country increasesconsiderably beyond the demand for labour, that habits of idleness andturbulence will be generated, most peculiarly unfavourable to a flourishingstate of manufactures. In spite of the cheapness of labour in Ireland, there arefew manufactures which can be prepared in that country for foreign sale so cheapas in England: and this is evidently owing to the want of those industrioushabits which can only be produced by regular employment.NOTES1 [63_X__Of_the_errors_in_different_pl.html#id_1240].

Dr. Crumpe’s prize essayon the best means of finding employment for the people, is an excellenttreatise, and contains much valuable information; but, till the capital of thecountry is better proportioned to its population, it is perfectly chimerical toexpect success in any project of the kind. I am also strongly disposed tobelieve that the indolent and turbulent habits of the lower Irish can never becorrected, while the potatoe system enables them to increase so much beyond theregular demand for labour.12 [63_X__Of_the_errors_in_different_pl.html#id_1254].

It is certainly to bewished, that every cottage in England should have a garden to it, well stockedwith vegetables. A little variety of food is in every point of view highlyuseful. Potatoes are undoubtedly a most valuable subsidiary, though I should bevery sorry ever to see them the principal dependence of our labourers.15 [63_X__Of_the_errors_in_different_pl.html#id_1258]. Question of Scarcity, &c.p. 80. This might be done, at least, with regard to workhouses. In assisting thepoor at their own homes, it might be subject to some practical difficulties.16 [63_X__Of_the_errors_in_different_pl.html#id_1256]. In this observation Ihave not the least idea of alluding to Mr. Young, who, I firmly believe,ardently wishes to ameliorate the condition of the lower classes of people,though I do not think that his plan would effect the object in view. He eitherdid not see those consequences which I apprehend from it; or he has a betteropinion of the happiness of the common people in Ireland, than I have. In hisIrish tour he seemed much struck with the plenty of potatoes which theypossessed, and the absence of all apprehension of want. Had he travelled in 1800and 1801, his impressions would by all accounts have been very different. Fromthe facility which has hitherto prevailed in Ireland of procuring potatoegrounds, scarcities have certainly been rare, and all the effects of the systemhave not yet been felt, though certainly enough to make it appear very far fromdesirable.Mr. Young has since pursued his idea more in detail, in a pamphlet, entitled, AnInquiry into the Propriety of applying Wastes to the better Maintenance andSupport of the Poor. But the impression on my mind is still the same; and itappears to me calculated to assimilate the condition of the labourers of thiscountry to that of the lower classes of the Irish. Mr. Young seems, in a mostunaccountable manner, to have forgotten all his general principles on thissubject. He has treated the question of a provision for the poor, as if it wasmerely, How to provide in the cheapest and best manner for a given number ofpeople? If this had been the sole question, it would never have taken so manyhundred years to resolve. But the real question is, How to provide for those whoare in want, in such a manner, as to prevent a continual accumulation of theirnumbers? and it will readily occur to the reader, that a plan of giving themland and cows cannot promise much success in this respect. If, after all thecommons had been divided, the poor laws were still to continue in force, no goodreason can be assigned, why the rates should not in a few years be as high asthey are at present, independently of all that had been expended in the purchaseof land and stock."},{"pageContent":"CHAP. XI.Of the necessity of general principles on this subject.IT has been observed by Hume, that of all sciences, there is none, where firstappearances are more deceitful than in politicks.1[64_XI__Of_the_necessity_of_general.html#id_1263] The remark is undoubtedly veryjust, and is most peculiarly applicable to that department of the science, whichrelates to the modes of improving the condition of the lower classes of society.We are continually hearing declamations against theory and theorists, by men whopride themselves upon the distinction of being practical. It must beacknowledged that bad theories are very bad things, and the authors of themuseless, and sometimes pernicious members of society. But these advocates ofpractice do not seem to be aware, that they themselves very often come underthis description, and that a great part of them may be classed among the mostmischievous theorists of their time. When a man faithfully relates any factswhich have come within the scope of his own observation, however confined it mayhave been, he undoubtedly adds to the sum of general knowledge, and confers abenefit on society. But when, from this confined experience, from the managementof his own little farm, or the details of the workhouse in his neighbourhood, hedraws a general inference, as is very frequently the case, he then at onceerects himself into a theorist; and is the more dangerous; because experiencebeing the only just foundation for theory, people are often caught merely by thesound of the word, and do not stop to make the distinction between that partialexperience which, on such subjects, is no foundation whatever for a just theory,and that general experience, on which alone a just theory can be founded.There are, perhaps, few subjects, on which human ingenuity has been moreexerted, than in the endeavour to ameliorate the condition of the poor; andthere is certainly no subject in which it has so completely failed. The questionbetween the theorist who calls himself practical, and the genuine theorist, is,whether this should prompt us to look into all the holes and corners ofworkhouses, and content ourselves with mulcting the parish officers for theirwaste of cheese parings and candle ends, and with distributing more soups andpotatoes; or to recur to general principles, which shew us at once the cause ofthe failure, and prove that the system has been from the beginning radicallyerroneous. There is no subject to which general principles have been so seldomapplied; and yet, in the whole compass of human knowledge, I doubt if there beone, in which it is so dangerous to lose sight of them; because the partial andimmediate effects of a particular mode of giving assistance are so oftendirectly opposite to the general and permanent effects.It has been observed in particular districts, where cottagers are possessed ofsmall pieces of land, and are in the habit of keeping cows, that, during thelate scarcities, some of them were able to support themselves without parishassistance, and others with comparatively little.2[64_XI__Of_the_necessity_of_general.html#id_1265]According to the partial view in which this subject has been alwayscontemplated, a general inference has been drawn from such instances, that, ifwe could place all our labourers in a similar situation, they would all beequally comfortable, and equally independent of the parish. This is aninference, however, that by no means follows. The advantage which cottagers, whoat present keep cows, enjoy, arises in a great measure from its being peculiar;and would be destroyed if it were made general.A farmer or gentleman living in a grazing country has, we will suppose, acertain number of cottages on his farm. Being a liberal man, and liking to seeall the people about him comfortable, he may join a piece of land to hiscottages sufficient to keep one or two cows, and give, besides, high wages. Hislabourers will of course live in plenty, and be able to rear up large families;but a grazing farm requires few hands; and though the master may choose to paythose that he employs well, he will not probably wish to have more labourers onhis farm than his work requires. He does not therefore build more houses; andthe children of the labourers whom he employs must evidently emigrate and settlein other countries. While such a system continues peculiar to certain families,or certain districts, no great inconveniencies arise from it to the community ingeneral; and it cannot be doubted, that the individual labourers employed onthese farms are in an enviable situation, and such as we might naturally wishwas the lot of all our labourers. But it is perfectly clear, that such a systemcould not, in the nature of things, possess the same advantages, if it were madegeneral; because there would then be no countries to which the children couldemigrate with any prospect of finding work. Population would evidently increasebeyond the demand of towns and manufactories, and universal poverty mustnecessarily ensue.It should be observed also, that one of the reasons, why the labourers who atpresent keep cows, are so comfortable, is, that they are able to make aconsiderable profit of the milk which they do not use themselves; an advantagewhich would evidently be very much diminished if the system were universal. Andthough they were certainly able to struggle through the late scarcities withless assistance than their neighbours, as might naturally be expected, fromtheir having other resources besides the article which in those individual yearswas scarce; yet if the system were universal, there can be no reason assigned,why they would not be subject to suffer as much from a scarcity of grass and amortality among cows, as our common labourers do now from a scarcity of wheat.We should be extremely cautious therefore of trusting to such appearances, andof drawing a general inference from this kind of partial experience.The main principle on which the society for increasing the comforts, andbettering the condition of the poor, professes to proceed, is excellent. To giveeffect to that masterspring of industry, the desire of bettering our condition,3[64_XI__Of_the_necessity_of_general.html#id_1267] is the true mode of improvingthe state of the lower classes; and we may safely agree with Mr. Bernard, in oneof his able prefaces, that whatever encourages and promotes habits of industry,prudence, foresight, virtue, and cleanliness, among the poor, is beneficial tothem and to the country; and whatever removes or diminishes the incitements toany of these qualities, is detrimental to the state, and pernicious to theindividual.4 [64_XI__Of_the_necessity_of_general.html#id_2223]Mr. Bernard, indeed, himself, seems in general to be fully aware of thedifficulties which the society has to contend with in the accomplishment of itsobject. But still it appears to be in some danger of falling into the errorbefore alluded to, of drawing general inferences from insufficient experience.Without adverting to the plans, respecting cheaper foods and parish shops,recommended by individuals, the beneficial effects of which depend entirely upontheir being peculiar to certain families or certain parishes, and would be lostif they were general, by lowering the wages of labour; I shall only notice oneobservation of a more comprehensive nature, which occurs in the preface to thesecond volume of the Reports. It is there remarked, that the experience of thesociety seemed to warrant the conclusion, that the best mode of relieving thepoor, was, by assisting them at their own homes, and placing out their childrenas soon as possible in different employments, apprenticeships, &c. I reallybelieve that this is the best, and it is certainly the most agreeable mode, inwhich occasional and discriminate assistance can be given. But it is evident,that it must be done with caution, and cannot be adopted as a general principle,and made the foundation of universal practice. It is open exactly to the sameobjection as the cow system in pasture countries which has just been noticed,and that part of the act of the 43d of Elizabeth which directs the overseers toemploy and provide for the children of the poor. A particular parish, where allthe children, as soon as they were of a proper age, were taken from theirparents, and placed out in proper situations, might be very comfortable; but ifthe system were general, and the poor saw that all their children would be thusprovided for, every employment would presently be overstocked with hands, andthe consequence need not be again repeated.Nothing can be more clear, than that it is within the power of money, and of theexertions of the rich, adequately to relieve a particular family, a particularparish, and even a particular district. But it will be equally clear, if wereflect a moment on the subject, that it is totally out of their power torelieve the whole country in the same way; at least, without providing a regularvent for the overflowing numbers in emigration, or without the prevalence of aparticular virtue among the poor, which the distribution of this assistancetends obviously to discourage.Even industry itself, is, in this respect, not very different from money. A manwho possesses a certain portion of it, above what is usually possessed by hisneighbours, will, in the actual state of things, be almost sure of a competentlivelihood; but if all his neighbours were to become at once as industrious ashimself, the absolute portion of industry which he before possessed would nolonger be a security against want. Hume fell into a very great error, when heasserted that “almost all the moral, as well as “natural evils of human life,arise from idleness;” and for the cure of these ills, required only that thewhole species should possess naturally an equal diligence, with that which manyindividuals are able to attain by habit and reflection.5[64_XI__Of_the_necessity_of_general.html#id_1269] It is evident that this givendegree of industry possessed by the whole species, if not combined with anothervirtue of which he takes no notice, would totally fail of rescuing society fromwant and misery, and would scarcely remove a single moral or physical evil, ofall those to which he alludes.I am aware of an objection, which will, with great appearance of justice, beurged against the general tenour of these reasonings. It will be said, that toargue thus, is at once to object to every mode of assisting the poor, as it isimpossible, in the nature of things, to assist people individually, withoutaltering their relative situation in society, and proportionally depressingothers; and that as those who have families, are the persons naturally mostsubject to distress, and as we are certainly not called upon to assist those whodo not want our aid, we must necessarily, if we act at all, relieve those whohave children, and thus encourage marriage and population.I have already observed, however, and I here repeat it again, that the generalprinciples on these subjects ought not to be pushed too far, though they shouldalways be kept in view; and that many cases may occur, in which the goodresulting from the relief of the present distress, may more than overbalance theevil to be apprehended from the remote consequence.All relief in instances of distress, not arising from idle and improvidenthabits, clearly comes under this description; and in general it may be observed,that it is only that kind of systematic and certain relief, on which the poorcan confidently depend, whatever may be their conduct, that violates generalprinciples, in such a manner, as to make it clear that the general consequenceis worse than the particular evil.Independently of this discriminate and occasional assistance, the beneficialeffects of which I have fully allowed in a preceding chapter, I have beforeendeavoured to shew, that much might be expected from a better and more generalsystem of education. Every thing that can be done in this way, has indeed a verypeculiar value; because education is one of those advantages, which not only allmay share without interfering with each other, but the raising of one person mayactually contribute to the raising of others. If, for instance, a man byeducation acquires that decent kind of pride, and those juster habits ofthinking, which will prevent him from burdening society with a family ofchildren, which he cannot support, his conduct, as far as an individual instancecan go, tends evidently to improve the condition of his fellow labourers; and acontrary conduct from ignorance, would tend as evidently to depress it.I cannot help thinking also, that something might be done towards bettering thesituation of the poor, by a general improvement of their cottages; if care weretaken, at the same time, not to make them so large, as to allow of two familiessettling in them; and not to increase their number faster than the demand forlabour required. Perhaps one of the most salutary, and least pernicious checks,to the frequency of early marriages in this country, is the difficulty ofprocuring a cottage, and the laudable habits which prompt a labourer rather todefer his marriage some years, in the expectation of a vacancy, than to contenthimself with a wretched mud cabin, like those in Ireland.6[64_XI__Of_the_necessity_of_general.html#id_1273]Even the cow system, upon a more confined plan, might not be open to objection.With any view of making it a substitute for the Poor Laws, and of givinglabourers a right to demand land and cows in proportion to their families; or oftaking the common people from the consumption of wheat, and feeding them on milkand potatoes; it appears to me, I confess, truly preposterous: but if it were soordered as merely to provide a comfortable situation for the better and moreindustrious class of labourers, and to supply, at the same time, a veryimportant want among the poor in general, that of milk for their children, Ithink that it would be extremely beneficial, and might be made a very powerfulincitement to habits of industry, economy, and prudence. With this view,however, it is evident, that only a certain portion of the labourers in eachparish could be embraced in the plan; that good conduct, and not mere distress,should have the most valid claim to preference; that too much attention shouldnot be paid to the number of children; and that, universally, those who hadsaved money enough for the purchase of a cow, should be preferred, to those whorequired to be furnished with one by the parish.7[64_XI__Of_the_necessity_of_general.html#id_1271]To facilitate the saving of small sums of money for this purpose, and encourageyoung labourers to economize their earnings with a view to a provision formarriage; it might be extremely useful to have country banks, where the smallestsums would be received, and a fair interest paid for them. At present, the fewlabourers who save a little money, are often greatly at a loss to know what todo with it; and under such circumstances we cannot be much surprised that itshould sometimes be ill employed, and last but a short time. It would probablybe essential to the success of any plan of this kind, that the labourer shouldbe able to draw out his money whenever he wanted it, and have the most perfectliberty of disposing of it in every respect as he pleased. Though we may regret,that money so hardly earned should sometimes be spent to little purpose; yet itseems to be a case in which we have no right to interfere; nor if we had, wouldit, in a general view, be advantageous; because the knowledge of possessing thisliberty would be of more use in encouraging the practice of saving, than anyrestriction of it, in preventing the misuse of money so saved.One should undoubtedly be extremely unwilling, not to make as much use aspossible of that known stimulus to industry and economy, the desire of, and theattachment to, property: but it should be recollected, that the good effects ofthis stimulus, show themselves principally, when this property is to beprocured, or preserved, by personal exertions; and that they are by no means sogeneral, under other circumstances. If any idle man with a family could demand,and obtain, a cow and some land, I should expect to see both very oftenneglected.It has been observed, that those cottagers who keep cows, are more industriousand more regular in their conduct than those who do not. This is probably true,and what might naturally be expected; but the inference that the way to make allpeople industrious, is to give them cows, may by no means be quite so certain.Most of those who keep cows at present have purchased them with the fruits oftheir own industry. It is therefore more just to say, that their industry hasgiven them a cow, than that a cow has given them their industry; though I wouldby no means be understood to imply, that the sudden possession of property nevergenerates industrious habits.The practical good effects which have been already experienced, from cottagerskeeping cows,8 [64_XI__Of_the_necessity_of_general.html#id_1275] arise in factfrom the system being nearly such as the confined plan which I have mentioned.In the districts where cottagers of this description most abound, they do notbear a very large proportion to the population of the whole parish: they consistin general of the better sort of labourers, who have been able to purchase theirown cows; and the peculiar comforts of their situation arise, more from therelative, than the positive advantages which they possess.From observing, therefore, their industry and comforts, we should be verycautious of inferring that we could give the same industry and comforts to allthe lower classes of people, by giving them the same possessions. There isnothing that has given rise to such a cloud of errors, as a confusion betweenrelative and positive, and between cause and effect.It may be said, however, that any plan of generally improving the cottages ofthe poor, or of enabling more of them to keep cows, would evidently give themthe power of rearing a greater number of children, and, by thus encouragingpopulation, violate the principles which I have endeavoured to establish. But ifI have been successful in making the reader comprehend the principal bent ofthis work, he will be aware, that the precise reason why I think that morechildren ought not to be born than the country can support, is, that thegreatest possible number of those that are born may be supported. We cannot, inthe nature of things, assist the poor, in any way, without enabling them to rearup to manhood a greater number of their children. But this is, of all otherthings, the most desirable, both with regard to individuals and the publick.Every loss of a child from the consequences of poverty, must evidently bepreceded and accompanied by great misery to individuals; and, in a publick view;every child that dies under ten years of age, is a loss to the nation of allthat had been expended in its subsistence till that period. Consequently, inevery point of view, a decrease of mortality, at all ages, is what we ought toaim at. We cannot, however, effect this object, without first crowding thepopulation in some degree by making more children grow up to manhood; but weshall do no harm in this respect, if, at the same time, we can impress thesechildren with the idea that to possess the same advantages as their parents,they must defer marriage till they have a fair prospect of being able tomaintain a family. And it must be candidly confessed that, if we cannot do this,all our former efforts will have been thrown away. It is not in the nature ofthings that any permanent and general improvement in the condition of the poorcan be effected, without an increase in the preventive check: and unless thistake place, either with, or without our efforts, every thing that is done forthe poor must be temporary and partial: a diminution of mortality at present,will be balanced by an increased mortality in future; and the improvement oftheir condition in one place, will proportionally depress it in another. This isa truth so important, and so little understood, that it can scarcely be toooften insisted on. The generality of charitable people and of the encouragers ofmarriage, are not in the smallest degree aware of the real effects of what theydo.Dr. Paley, in a chapter on population, provision, &c. in his Moral Philosophy,observes, that the condition most favourable to the population of a country,and, at the same time, to its general happiness, is, “that of a laborious frugalpeople ministering to the demands of an opulent, luxurious nation.” 9[64_XI__Of_the_necessity_of_general.html#id_1279] Such a form of society hasnot, it must be confessed, an inviting aspect. Nothing but the conviction of itsbeing absolutely necessary, could reconcile us to the idea of ten millions ofpeople condemned to incessant toil, and to the privation of every thing butabsolute necessaries, in order to minister to the excessive luxuries of theother million. But the fact is, that such a form of society is by no meansnecessary. It is by no means necessary, that the rich should be excessivelyluxurious, in order to support the manufactures of a country, or that the poorshould be deprived of all luxuries, in order to make them sufficiently numerous.The best, and in every point of view the most advantageous, manufactures in thiscountry, are those which are consumed by the great body of the people. Themanufactures which are confined exclusively to the rich, are not only trivial onaccount of the comparative smallness of their quantity; but are further liableto the great disadvantage of producing much occasional misery among thoseemployed in them, from changes of fashion. It is the spread of luxury,therefore, among the mass of the people, and not an excess of it in a few, thatseems to be most advantageous, both with regard to national wealth and nationalhappiness; and what Dr. Paley considers as the true evil and proper danger ofluxury, I should be disposed to consider as its true good, and peculiaradvantage. If, indeed, it be allowed that in every society, not in the state ofa new colony, some powerful check to population must prevail; and if it beobserved, that a taste for the comforts and conveniences of life will preventpeople from marrying under the certainty of being deprived of those advantages;it must be allowed that we can hardly expect to find any check to marriage solittle prejudicial to the happiness and virtue of society as the generalprevalence of such a taste; and consequently that the spread of luxury10[64_XI__Of_the_necessity_of_general.html#id_1277] in this sense of the term, isparticularly desirable; and one of the best means of raising that standard ofwretchedness, alluded to in the eighth chapter of this book.It has been generally found that the middle parts of society are most favourableto virtuous and industrious habits, and to the growth of all kinds of talents.But it is evident, that all cannot be in the middle. Superior and inferior partsare, in the nature of things, absolutely necessary; and not only necessary, butstrikingly beneficial. If no man could hope to rise, or fear to fall in society;if industry did not bring with it its reward, and indolence its punishment; wecould not expect to see that animated activity in bettering our condition, whichnow forms the master-spring of publick prosperity. But in contemplating thedifferent states of Europe, we observe a very considerable difference in therelative proportions of the superior, the middle, and the inferior parts; andfrom the effect of these differences, it seems probable, that our best groundedexpectations of an increase in the happiness of the mass of human society, arefounded in the prospect of an increase in the relative proportions of the middleparts. And if the lower classes of people had acquired the habit ofproportioning the supplies of labour to a stationary, or even decreasing demand,without an increase of misery and mortality, as at present; we might evenventure to indulge a hope, that at some future period the processes forabridging human labour, the progress of which has of late years been so rapid,might ultimately supply all the wants of the most wealthy society with lesspersonal labour than at present; and if they did not diminish the severity ofindividual exertion, might, at least, diminish the number of those employed insevere toil. If the lowest classes of society were thus diminished, and themiddle classes increased, each labourer might indulge a more rational hope ofrising by diligence and exertion into a better station; the rewards of industryand virtue would be increased in number; human society would appear to consistof fewer blanks and more prizes; and the sum of social happiness would beevidently augmented.To indulge, however, in any distant views of this kind, unaccompanied by theevils usually attendant on a stationary, or decreasing demand for labour, wemust suppose the general prevalence of such prudential habits among the poor, aswould prevent them from marrying, when the actual price of labour, joined towhat they might have saved in their single state, would not give them theprospect of being able to support a wife and six children without assistance.And, in every point of view, such a degree of prudential restraint would beextremely beneficial; and would produce a very striking amelioration in thecondition of the lower classes of people.It may be said, perhaps, that even this degree of prudence might not alwaysavail, as when a man marries he cannot tell what number of children he shallhave, and many have more than six. This is certainly true; and in this case I donot think that any evil would result from making a certain allowance to everychild above this number; not with a view of rewarding a man for his largefamily, but merely, of relieving him from a species of distress, which it wouldbe unreasonable in us to expect that he should calculate upon. And with thisview, the relief should be merely such, as to place him exactly in the samesituation as if he had had six children. Montesquieu disapproves of an edict ofLewis the fourteenth, which gave certain pensions to those who had ten andtwelve children, as being of no use in encouraging population.11[64_XI__Of_the_necessity_of_general.html#id_1281] For the very reason that hedisapproves of it, I should think that some law of the kind might be adoptedwithout danger, and might relieve particular individuals from a very pressingand unlooked-for distress, without operating in any respect as an encouragementto marriage.If at some future period, any approach should be made towards the more generalprevalence of prudential habits with respect to marriage among the poor, fromwhich alone any permanent and general improvement of their condition can arise;I do not think that the narrowest politician need be alarmed at it, from thefear of its occasioning such an advance in the price of labour as will enableour commercial competitors to undersell us in foreign markets. There are fourcircumstances that might be expected to accompany it, which would probablyeither prevent, or fully counterbalance, any effect of this kind. These are,1st, The more equable and lower price of provisions, from the demand being lessfrequently above the supply. 2dly, The removal of that heavy burden onagriculture, and that great addition to the present wages of labour, the poorsrates. 3dly, The national saving of a great part of that sum, which is expendedwithout return, in the support of those children who die prematurely, from theconsequences of poverty. And, lastly, The more general prevalence of economicaland industrious habits, particularly among unmarried men, which would preventthat indolence, drunkenness, and waste of labour, which at present are toofrequently a consequence of high wages.NOTES1 [64_XI__Of_the_necessity_of_general.html#id_1262].

Perhaps, however, this isnot often left to his choice, on account of the fear which every parish has ofincreasing its poor. There are many ways by which our poor laws operate incounteracting their first obvious tendency to increase population, and this isone of them. I have little doubt that it is almost exclusively owing to thesecounteracting causes, that we have been able to persevere in this system solong, and that the condition of the poor has not been so much injured by it asmight have been expected.7 [64_XI__Of_the_necessity_of_general.html#id_1270]. The act of Elizabeth whichprohibited the building of cottages, unless four acres of land were annexed tothem, is probably impracticable in a manufacturing country like England; butupon this principle, certainly the greatest part of the poor might possess land;because the difficulty of procuring such cottages would always operate as apowerful check to their increase. The effect of such a plan would be verydifferent from that of Mr. Young’s.8 [64_XI__Of_the_necessity_of_general.html#id_1274].

Vol. ii. c. xi. p. 359.From a passage in Dr. Paley’s late work on Natural Theology, I am inclined tothink, that subsequent reflection has induced him to modify some of his formerideas on the subject of population. He has stated most justly, (chap. xxv. p.539.) that mankind will in every country breed up to a certain point ofdistress. If this be allowed, that country will evidently be the happiest, wherethe degree of distress at this point is the least, and consequently, if thespread of luxury, by producing the check sooner, tend to diminish this degree ofdistress, it is certainly desirable.10 [64_XI__Of_the_necessity_of_general.html#id_1276]. In a note to the tenthchapter of the last book, I have mentioned the point at which, alone, it isprobable that luxury becomes really prejudicial to a country. But this pointdoes not depend upon the spread of luxury, as diminishing the frequency ofmarriage among the poor, but upon the proportion which those employed inpreparing or procuring luxuries, bears to the funds which are to support them.11 [64_XI__Of_the_necessity_of_general.html#id_1280]. Esprit des Loix, liv.xxiii. c. xxvii."},{"pageContent":"CHAP. XII.Of our rational expectations respecting the future improvement of Society.IN taking a general and concluding view of our rational expectations respectingthe mitigation of the evils arising from the principle of population, it may beobserved, that though the increase of population in a geometrical ratio beincontrovertible, and the period of doubling, when unchecked, has been uniformlystated in this work, rather below than above the truth; yet there are somenatural consequences of the progress of society and civilization, whichnecessarily repress its full effects. There are, more particularly, great townsand manufactures, in which we can scarcely hope, and certainly not expect, tosee any very material change. It is undoubtedly our duty, and in every point ofview highly desirable, to make towns and manufacturing employments as littleinjurious as possible to the duration of human life; but, after all our efforts,it is probable that they will always remain less healthy than country situationsand country employments; and consequently, operating as positive checks, willdiminish in some degree the necessity of the preventive check.In every old state it is observed, that a considerable number of grown-uppeople, remain for a time unmarried. The duty of practising the common andacknowledged rules of morality during this period, has never been controvertedin theory, however it may have been opposed in practice. This branch of the dutyof moral restraint has scarcely been touched by the reasonings of this work. Itrests on the same foundation as before, neither stronger nor weaker. And knowinghow incompletely this duty has hitherto been fulfilled, it would certainly bevisionary to expect any very material change for the better, in future.The part which has been affected by the reasonings of this work is not,therefore, that which relates to our conduct during the period of celibacy, butto the duty of extending this period till we have a prospect of being able tomaintain our children. And it is by no means visionary to indulge a hope of somefavourable change in this respect; because it is found by experience, that theprevalence of this kind of prudential restraint is extremely different indifferent countries, and in the same countries at different periods.It cannot be doubted, that throughout Europe in general, and most particularlyin the northern states, a decided change has taken place in the operation ofthis prudential restraint, since the prevalence of those warlike andenterprising habits which destroyed so many people. In later times, the gradualdiminution, and almost total extinction, of the plagues which so frequentlyvisited Europe in the seventeenth and the beginning of the eighteenth centuries,produced a change of the same kind. And in this country it is not to be doubtedthat the proportion of marriages has become smaller, since the improvement ofour towns, the less frequent returns of epidemicks, and the adoption of habitsof greater cleanliness. During the late scarcities, it appears that the numberof marriages diminished; and the same motives which prevented many people frommarrying during such a period, would operate precisely in the same way, if, infuture, the additional number of children reared to manhood from theintroduction of the cow-pox, were to be such, as to crowd all employments, lowerthe price of labour, and make it more difficult to support a family.Universally, the practice of mankind on the subject of marriage has been muchsuperior to their theories; and however frequent may have been the declamationson the duty of entering into this state, and the advantage of early unions toprevent vice, each individual has practically found it necessary to consider ofthe means of supporting a family, before he ventured to take so important astep. That great vis medicatrix reipublicæ, the desire of bettering ourcondition, and the fear of making it worse, has been constantly in action, andhas been constantly directing people into the right road in spite of all thedeclamations which tended to lead them aside. Owing to this powerful spring ofhealth in every state, which is nothing more than an inference from the generalcourse of the laws of nature, irresistibly forced on each man’s attention, theprudential check to marriage has increased in Europe; and it cannot beunreasonable to conclude, that it will still make further advances. If this takeplace, without any marked and decided increase of a vicious intercourse with thesex, the happiness of society will evidently be promoted by it; and with regardto the danger of such increase, it is consolatory to remark, that thosecountries in Europe where marriages are the least frequent, are by no meansparticularly distinguished by vices of this kind. It has appeared that Norway,Switzerland, England, and Scotland, are above all the rest in the prevalence ofthe preventive check; and though I do not mean to insist particularly on thevirtuous habits of these countries, yet I think that no person would select themas the countries most marked for profligacy of manners. Indeed, from the littlethat I know of the continent, I should have been inclined to select them as mostdistinguished for contrary habits, and as rather above than below theirneighbours in the chastity of their women, and consequently in the virtuoushabits of their men. Experience therefore seems to teach us, that it is possiblefor moral and physical causes to counteract the effects that might at first beexpected from an increase of the preventive check; but allowing all the weightto these effects which is in any degree probable, it may be safely asserted,that the diminution of the vices arising from indigence, would fullycounterbalance them; and that all the advantages of diminished mortality, andsuperior comforts, which would certainly result from an increase of thepreventive check, may be placed entirely on the side of the gains to the causeof happiness and virtue.It is less the object of the present work to propose new plans of improvingsociety, than to inculcate the necessity of resting contented with that mode ofimprovement, which is dictated by the course of nature, and of not obstructingthe advances which would otherwise be made in this way.It would be undoubtedly highly advantageous, that all our positive institutions,and the whole tenour of our conduct to the poor, should be such as actively toco-operate with that lesson of prudence inculcated by the common course of humanevents; and if we take upon ourselves, sometimes, to mitigate the naturalpunishments of imprudence, that we should balance it by increasing the rewardsof an opposite conduct. But much would be done, if merely the institutions whichdirectly tend to encourage marriage were gradually changed, and we ceased tocirculate opinions, and inculcate doctrines, which positively counteract thelessons of nature.The limited good which it is sometimes in our power to effect, is often lost byattempting too much, and by making the adoption of some particular planessentially necessary even to a partial degree of success. In the practicalapplication of the reasonings of this work, I hope that I have avoided thiserror. I wish to press on the recollection of the reader, that, though I mayhave given some new views of old facts, and may have indulged in thecontemplation of a considerable degree of possible improvement, that I might notabsolutely shut out that prime cheerer hope; yet in my expectations of probableimprovement, and in suggesting the means of accomplishing it, I have been verycautious. The gradual abolition of the poor laws has already often beenproposed, in consequence of the practical evils which have been found to flowfrom them, and the danger of their becoming a weight absolutely intolerable onthe landed property of the kingdom. The establishment of a more extensive systemof national education, has neither the advantage of novelty with some, nor itsdisadvantage with others, to recommend it. The practical good effects ofeducation have long been experienced in Scotland; and almost every person whohas been placed in a situation to judge, has given his testimony, that educationappears to have a considerable effect in the prevention of crimes,1[65_XII__Of_our_rational_expectation.html#id_1283] and the promotion ofindustry, morality, and regular conduct. Yet these are the only plans which havebeen offered; and though the adoption of them in the modes suggested, would verypowerfully contribute to forward the object of this work, and better thecondition of the poor; yet if nothing be done in this way, I shall notabsolutely despair of some partial good effects from the general tenour of thereasoning.If the principles which I have endeavoured to establish be false, I mostsincerely hope to see them completely refuted; but if they be true, the subjectis so important, and interests the question of human happiness so nearly, thatit is impossible that they should not in time be more fully known, and moregenerally circulated, whether any particular efforts be made for the purpose ornot.Among the higher and middle classes of society, the effect of this knowledgewould, I hope, be to direct without relaxing their efforts in bettering thecondition of the poor; to show them what they can, and what they cannot do; andthat, although much may be done by advice and instruction, by encouraging habitsof prudence and cleanliness, by occasional and discriminate charity, and by anymode of bettering the present condition of the poor, which is followed by anincrease of the preventive check; yet that, without this last effect, all theformer efforts would be futile; and that, in any old and well-peopled state, toassist the poor in such a manner as to enable them to marry as early as theyplease, and rear up large families, is a physical impossibility. This knowledge,by tending to prevent the rich from destroying the good effects of their ownexertions, and wasting their efforts in a direction where success isunattainable, would confine their attention to the proper objects, and thusenable them to do more good.Among the poor themselves, its effects would be still more important. That theprincipal and most permanent cause of poverty, has little or no relation toforms of government, or the unequal division of property; and that, as the richdo not in reality possess the power of finding employment and maintenance forthe poor, the poor cannot, in the nature of things, possess the right to demandthem, are important truths flowing from the principle of population, which, whenproperly explained, would by no means be above the most ordinary comprehensions.And it is evident, that every man in the lower classes of society, who becameacquainted with these truths, would be disposed to bear the distresses in whichhe might be involved with more patience; would feel less discontent andirritation at the government and the higher classes of society on account of hispoverty; would be on all occasions less disposed to insubordination andturbulence; and if he received assistance, either from any publick institution,or from the hand of private charity, he would receive it with more thankfulness,and more justly appreciate its value.If these truths were by degrees more generally known, which in the course oftime does not seem to be improbable, from the natural effects of the mutualinterchange of opinions, the lower classes of people, as a body, would becomemore peaceable and orderly; would be less inclined to tumultuous proceedings inseasons of scarcity, and would at all times be less influenced by inflammatoryand seditious publications, from knowing how little the price of labour, and themeans of supporting a family, depend upon a revolution. The mere knowledge ofthese truths, even if they did not operate sufficiently to produce any markedchange in the prudential habits of the poor, with regard to marriage, wouldstill have a most beneficial effect on their conduct in a political light; andundoubtedly one of the most valuable of these effects would be, the power thatwould result to the higher and middle classes of society of gradually improvinggovernments,2 [65_XII__Of_our_rational_expectation.html#id_1285] without theapprehension of those revolutionary excesses, the fear of which, at present,threatens to deprive Europe even of that degree of liberty, which she had beforeexperienced to be practicable, and the salutary effects of which she had longenjoyed.From a review of the state of society in former periods, compared with thepresent, I should certainly say, that the evils resulting from the principle ofpopulation have rather diminished, than increased, even under the disadvantageof an almost total ignorance of their real cause. And if we can indulge the hopethat this ignorance will be gradually dissipated, it does not seem unreasonableto expect, that they will be still further diminished. The increase of absolutepopulation which will of course take place, will evidently tend but little toweaken this expectation, as every thing depends upon the relative proportionsbetween population and food, and not on the absolute number of people. In theformer part of this work, it appeared, that the countries which possessed thefewest people, often suffered the most from the effects of the principle ofpopulation; and it can scarcely be doubted, that taking Europe throughout, fewerfamines, and fewer diseases arising from want, have prevailed in the lastcentury, than in those which preceded it.On the whole, therefore, though our future prospects respecting the mitigationof the evils arising from the principle of population, may not be so bright aswe could wish, yet they are far from being entirely disheartening, and by nomeans preclude that gradual and progressive improvement in human society, which,before the late wild speculations on the subject, was the object of rationalexpectation. To the laws of property and marriage, and to the apparently narrowprinciple of self-love, which prompts each individual to exert himself inbettering his condition, we are indebted for all the noblest exertions of humangenius, for every thing that distinguishes the civilized from the savage state.A strict inquiry into the principle of population leads us strongly to theconclusion, that we shall never be able to throw down the ladder by which wehave risen to this eminence; but it by no means proves that we may not risehigher by the same means. The structure of society, in its great features, willprobably always remain unchanged. We have every reason to believe, that it willalways consist of a class of proprietors, and a class of labourers; but thecondition of each, and the proportion which they bear to each other, may be soaltered as greatly to improve the harmony and beauty of the whole. It would,indeed, be a melancholy reflection, that, while the views of physical scienceare daily enlarging, so as scarcely to be bounded by the most distant horizon,the science of moral and political philosophy should be confined within suchnarrow limits, or at best be so feeble in its influence, as to be unable tocounteract the increasing obstacles to human happiness arising from the progressof population. But however formidable these obstacles may have appeared in someparts of this work, it is hoped that the general result of the inquiry is such,as not to make us give up the cause of the improvement of human society indespair. The partial good which seems to be attainable, is worthy of all ourexertions; is sufficient to direct our efforts and animate our prospects. Andalthough we cannot expect that the virtue and happiness of mankind will keeppace with the brilliant career of physical discovery, yet if we are not wantingto ourselves, we may confidently indulge the hope, that, to no unimportantextent, they will be influenced by its progress, and will partake in itssuccess.NOTES1 [65_XII__Of_our_rational_expectation.html#id_1282].

As early as 1806, anexasperated Malthus felt compelled to add an appendix to the third edition ofthe Essay “to correct some of the misrepresentations which have gone abroad”regarding the main points of the much-expanded second edition of the workpublished in 1803. Much of the declamation against the theory was so devoid ofargument, in Malthus’s view, that it was unworthy of a response. The appendixwas aimed instead at those who not having “had leisure to read the whole work”might interpret it in the light of the “partial and incorrect statements whichthey have heard.”2 [67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2364] Malthussensed that there was a large class of readers who were liable to misconstruehis opinions not because they had failed to read the book, but because they hadread it too selectively. While he did not specify precisely which parts of theEssay he thought were being overlooked, a number of factors suggest that he mayhave had the first two books of the “Great Quarto” in mind. In the first place,and as is shown below, no one who had read this part of the work attentivelywould have made the main accusation that Malthus set out to deny in theappendix, that is, that he was an enemy of population. Furthermore, while thesebooks were not entirely ignored in the myriad publications that engaged with thework in the nineteenth century, aside from the preface and the first twochapters, books 1 and 2 received scant attention relative to 3 and 4, suggestingthat they made a more limited impression on the public imagination.3[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2362] That the first half of a workshould be neglected in this way seems less anomalous when we consider itscontents and the role it was intended to fulfil.The first Essay on the Principle of Population (1798) had been dashed off byMalthus following a debate with his father (a fanatical Rousseauian) about humanperfectibility. Its main target was William Godwin, who in his EnquiryConcerning Political Justice (1793) had argued that most of society’s evilsstemmed from the inequality of riches occasioned by the institutions of propertyand marriage. Their gradual abolition, accompanied by an inevitable improvementin man’s ability to control his destructive sexual and violent impulses, wouldlead to something akin to paradise on earth. In the Essay, Malthus argued thatpopulation growth tended to outstrip man’s ability to increase the produce ofthe soil, condemning even the most advanced states to suffer perpetualoscillations between happiness and misery. The “strong law of necessity” wouldalways act “as a check on the greater power.” In old states, reason was broughtto bear on the power of population in the form of preventive checks: thedelaying of marriage from “a foresight of the difficulties attending the rearingof a family.” In England, such checks operated at every level of society, butespecially among the middle classes who, loath to accept the reducedcircumstances that additional mouths entailed, deferred matrimony until they hadbuilt up a nest egg.4 [67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2360]Positive checks, on the other hand, did their work almost exclusively among thepoor. Arising principally from the inability of parents suffering from severewant to provide proper nutrition for their offspring, they produced highchild-mortality and general ill health. Vice, in the form of “irregulargratifications,” always accompanied the preventive check, while misery was thenatural bedfellow of both positive and preventive checks. Since periods wouldalways arise when population pressed hard upon the limits of subsistence, nogreat improvement could be expected in the long-term condition of the poor, norwould a more equal distribution of resources, along the lines advocated byGodwin, fix things. Assured that all would be provided for, and enjoying a moreliberal commerce of the sexes, the citizens of Godwin’s paradise would soonbreed beyond their food supply; in the ensuing struggle for meager resources,the narrower affections would displace benevolence as the ruling passions, and,ultimately, “an administration of property, not very different from that whichprevails in civilized States at present, would be established as the best,though inadequate, remedy for the evils which were pressing on the society.”5[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2358]Reflecting on the first Essay in the preface to the second edition, Malthusrecalled how “in the course of this discussion” about perfectibility, he hadcome to realize that population oscillations “account for much of that povertyand misery observable among the lower classes of people in every nation, and forthose reiterated failures in the efforts of the higher classes to relieve them,”and he therefore resolved “to turn my leisure reading towards an historicalexamination of the principle of population on the past and present state ofsociety.”6 [67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2356] It is thishistorical examination, aimed at lending “a more practical and permanentinterest to the subject,” that takes up most of books 1 and 2.7[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2354] Book 1 looks at checks topopulation in “less civilised parts of the world, and in past times,” while book2 examines the checks in the different states of modern Europe. Book 2 islargely centered on the available statistical data for births, deaths, andmarriages in modern European states, though some chapters draw on informationcollected by Malthus himself, on trips to Scandinavia and Russia in 1799, andFrance and Switzerland in 1802. Book 1, on the other hand, is based almostentirely on travel writing and works of history.8[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2352]Despite Malthus’s labors, however, it was the second half of the book thatreceived most attention. Patricia James noted how the attack on Godwin’s theoryof perfectibility (in book 3), which she saw as a relatively unimportant part ofthe second edition of the Essay, continued to exercise reviewers.9[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2350] Equally, Malthus’s prescribedremedy for overpopulation, detailed in book 4, provoked much debate. If the caseagainst perfectibility made in 1798 was “conclusive,” by 1803 Malthus had cometo entertain more sanguine expectations about improving the lot of the poor,having discovered evidence that the great amelioration which had taken place intheir condition in some European states was owing to their increasing tendencyto practice prudential restraint. By lowering the number of souls in proportionto the means of subsistence, preventive checks had increased each individual’scommand of essentials. This upward trend was set to continue in the future,according to Malthus, but at a pace determined by prevailing opinions aboutpopulation and the institutional factors influencing marriage customs in eachcountry. If the governing classes were serious about tackling poverty, theyneeded to inculcate opinions and develop institutions that encouraged thelaborer to delay marriage until he had sufficient funds to support a family.This would raise the price of labor by narrowing the supply. Furthermore, if thewould-be couple could be persuaded to refrain from “irregular gratifications” inthe period between the onset of sexual maturity and marriage – that is, topractice moral rather than merely prudential restraint – they might avoidaltogether the vice and misery that, it was claimed in the 1798 edition,invariably accompanied population checks. Whereas the social and religiousimplications of moral restraint came in for intense scrutiny,10[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2348] and much ink was also spilton Malthus’s call for the gradual abolition of the Poor Laws, barring a fewexceptions,11 [67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2346] the so-calledfactual part of the theory contained in books 1 and 2 was dealt withperfunctorily by nineteenth commentators. And since most of the historicalscholarship has been concerned with exploring the social, political, economic,and religious debates that Malthus was contributing to, it has understandablyshared the bias in favor of the themes discussed in books 3 and 4.12[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2344] Two glaring exceptions to thenineteenth-century pattern were Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, forwhom the description of “the struggle for existence” among men in book 1 of theEssay provided revelatory insights into the mechanisms underpinning naturalselection in the plant and animal kingdoms.13[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#page_493] Surprisingly, however, theprofuse historical literature on this engagement has had little to say about theintentions underlying the early parts of the quarto, and those few scholarlytreatments we do have of these sections are largely descriptive.14[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2341]It is argued here, however, that if we are to do justice to Malthus’s authorialintentions, we need to reorient our view of the Essay so as to give thehistorical aspects of the theory their proper weight, most obviously because theprinciple of population purports to be an argument based on historicalobservation. It is this record of human experience that comprises the“scientific” underpinning of all of Malthus’s practical recommendations and thatforms the sole basis for his restored faith in “that gradual and progressiveimprovement in human society, which, before the late wild speculations on thissubject, was the object of rational expectation.”15[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2339] But even if we accept thatwhat really matters about the Essay are the social and political issues thatconcerned most of its nineteenth-century readers, it can also be shown thatthese arguments were never meant to be read in isolation from the historicaldemography of the earlier books. A second aim of this essay therefore is torestore this critical context to Malthus’s social and political thought. Itdemonstrates that paying due attention to books 1 and 2 dramatically altersone’s experience of the book, and that had readers engaged with them moreseriously, the Essay would not have become “one of the most . . . misunderstoodworks published during the last two hundred years.”16[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2337]Ironically, it was with a view to winning over the largest possible number ofreaders that Malthus decided to detail the effects of population pressure “atdifferent times and on different occasions.” Such an exposition might entailneedless repetition and an overly detailed analysis of some facets of theproblem, admitted Malthus, but without it he did not entertain “the slightesthope of producing conviction” regarding those conclusions that were “differentfrom our usual habits of thinking.”17[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2335] In order to understand whatMalthus was doing in the first half of the Essay of 1803, then, we need toidentify the conclusions he was referring to and the habitual patterns ofthought militating against their ready acceptance. Books 1 and 2 wereprincipally aimed at establishing two strands of argument about the past andpresent effects of the principle of population. In the first place, the historyof the poor revealed a progressive development in the ways in which humansocieties grappled with the principle of population, which brought to light themeans by which they might escape its worst consequences. According to Malthus,the principal “scientific” objective of the opening books was to establish atypology of population checks with a view to assessing the likelihood of their“total or partial removal.”18 [67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2333]This analysis showed how the emergence of increasingly rational customs inrelation to marriage had enabled certain European societies to escape theoscillations between feast and famine to which past and “savage” peoples wereinvariably condemned.19 [67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2331] Butthe history of population checks also served the more basic purpose ofestablishing the existence of the principle of population in the first place.Notwithstanding Malthus’s remark in 1806 that the he considered the theory ofpopulation to have been “established in the first six pages” of the Essay, itwas clearly one of the chief aims of the first half of the book to bring home toreaders its material reality.20[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2329] He needed to show, in thefirst place, that checks to population were in constant operation, and notsomething that would only occur in the distant future when the whole world hadbeen fully cultivated. Godwin had appealed to the latter assumption in responseto Robert Wallace’s assertion that the sense of economic security occasioned bysystems of perfect equality would inevitably encourage such unfetteredreproduction that the world would soon be peopled up to the limits of its foodsupply.21 [67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2327] Seeing that largeportions of the globe remained uncultivated, and the cultivated parts werecapable of “immeasurable improvement,” replied Godwin, advocates of humanperfectibility could take heart from the fact that “Myriads of centuries” mustpass before the earth was overstocked.22[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#page_494] By proving that such checkshad existed always and everywhere, the first two books helped Malthus toreinforce the central argument of the first Essay that population pressure wouldpresent an “imminent and immediate” obstacle to schemes of humanperfectibility.23 [67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2324] But in thesecond Essay, Godwin’s speculations were treated merely as one of the proposedanswers to what was now the main question in hand – how to improve the conditionof the poor. Previous efforts to ameliorate poverty had proven at best futile,at worst counterproductive, according to Malthus, because of a failure toidentify its true causes. Another crucial aim of the demographic history, then,was to prove beyond doubt that population oscillations were to blame.This diagnosis flew in the face of the universal consensus that populationgrowth was the most important measure of economic improvement and the proper aimof government policy. In his Cambridge textbook, the Principles of Moral andPolitical Philosophy (1785), the Christian utilitarian William Paley had echoedAdam Smith and virtually every writer on the subject in deeming the increase ofpopulation to be “the object which ought, in all countries, to be aimed at inpreference to every other political purpose whatsoever.”24[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2322] Exacerbating the difficultyof uprooting such views was the fact that they were widely believed to accordwith Christian doctrine. As well as appearing to contradict the scripturalcommand to increase and multiply, Malthus’s theory assailed the complacentoptimism underlying some of the core strictures of the dominant strain of moraland religious thought in the period, the doctrine of utility, not least Paley’sassumption that every increase in population advanced the providential plan byadding to the stock of human happiness.25[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2320] Worse still, Malthus seemedto impugn the benevolence of the deity in the process – hence his concertedefforts in both editions of the Essay to justify the ways of God to man.26[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2318] Not only did the theoryrankle with deeply entrenched attitudes, however, but as Malthus explained inthe first Essay, there was something about the demographic phenomenon itselfthat made it particularly hard for the reading public to swallow.An oscillation was triggered when population increased before a growth in thefood supply, diminishing each person’s share of subsistence and reducing many tohardship. In modern states, the swell in numbers increased the supply of labor,lowering its price while the price of food remained the same, forcing thelaborer to work harder for the same wages he had earned before. Birth rateswould eventually return to their former levels as the difficulties of raising afamily in such conditions discouraged laborers from marrying, while, at the sametime, the cheapness and ready availability of labor would encourage cultivatorsto employ more hands to plow more soil and improve its general fertility.Equilibrium between the population and the food supply would thus be restored,and the conditions of the laborer would improve accordingly; but this wouldagain loosen “the restraints to population” such that “the retrograde andprogressive movements with respect to happiness are repeated.” As Malthusfrequently observed, however, there were a number of factors that concealed suchvibrations “from common view” in modern societies, most importantly thedifference of the real and nominal price of labor, which meant that the fall inthe real price was often obscured by the nominal price remaining the same.27[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2316] Unhappily, it was thepositive checks among the rural poor, in particular, that tended to be hidden inthis way. So whereas the high mortality of poor children in cities oftenprovoked concerned comment,28 [67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2314]a starry-eyed view of rural life endured, fostering complacency among theeducated ranks about the condition of country children. Like a modern-daytelevision charity appeal, Malthus presented readers with images designed toshock them into a sense of urgency about child poverty in the countryside, fromthe stunted sons of laborers to scrawny-calved plow-hands. “The sons anddaughters of peasants” were clearly not “the rosy cherubs” described in theromances, and their sufferings could “only be attributed to a want either ofproper or of sufficient nourishment.”29[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2312]In this context an important clue as to the intentions behind the second Essaycomes to light, as Malthus alleged that a principal reason for the widespreadobliviousness to the sufferings of the rural poor was that the histories of manhad focused exclusively on the higher classes, relating little about the livesof those among whom positive checks operated. Chapter 3 of the first Essay hadpresented a brief historical examination of such oscillations, but soon afterits publication Malthus appears to have decided that this “cursory review” wasinadequate to the broader purposes of the second edition.30[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2310] The “faithful history” of thesecond Essay was aimed at writing the great mass of the people into history, andit needed to be comprehensive enough to leave readers in no doubt as to theunremitting effects of population pressure on their lives. The history beginsthen with Malthus’s incredibly vivid descriptions of “the lowest stages of humanexistence” as represented by the indigenous peoples of America, New Zealand, andAustralia – accounts based on the travel writings of Captain James Cook, DavidCollins, Mungo Park, and other explorers. “In savage life, where there is noregular price of labour,” the “progressive and retrograde movements” areabundantly evident, as they everywhere produce scenes of unparalleled horror. Ofthe American Indians Malthus reports that, “like beasts of prey, they musteither drive away or fly from every rival, and be engaged in perpetual contestswith each other.” New Zealanders, similarly, “live under perpetual apprehensionsof being destroyed by each other.”31[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2308] In these opening chapters weread about “perpetual diseases,” “perpetual wandering and hardship,” “perpetualquarrels” between savages who live in “a perpetual state of war.”32[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2306] The reason for this endlessstruggle, according to Malthus, was that without prudential restraint to limitpopulation or the technological means of increasing the food supply, anyadvantage in procuring subsistence, leading to an increase of numbers in onetribe, will inevitably result in the destruction of their competitors.Lacking both the technology and foresight to increase subsistence, tribes ofhunter-gatherers are rarely populous. Among pastoral nations, by contrast,unlimited access to fresh pastures unleashes mighty powers of increase, whichhave historically found vent in great barbarian conquests like those of theHuns, Moguls, and Tartars. Here the checks to population are “but too obvious,”often involving “a whole people in indiscriminate massacre.” Inquiries into thestate of modern pastoral peoples revealed with equal clarity how population wasdistributed according to levels of subsistence. Tribes inhabiting barren desertregions lived further apart and were far more sparsely populated than thoseoccupying land with a good covering of soil. This principle, “so obvious” inGrand Tartary, Syria, and Arabia, was “equally applicable to the whole earth,”asserted Malthus, but “the commerce of civilized nations” tended to concealit.33 [67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2304] Nowhere were theoscillations more readily observable, however, than on islands inhabited bysavage societies, for here economic simplicity combined with clearly definedbarriers to population growth. It was customary for the upper echelons ofEareeoie societies, for example, to suffocate newborns with a wet cloth, both asa means of facilitating their licentious lifestyle and of limiting the numbersenjoying it. Frequent and devastating wars in which the vanquishers destroyedtheir enemy’s means of subsistence, combined with libertinage and infanticide,served to decimate the Othaheite (Tahiti) population, such that when CaptainVancouver returned to the island in 1791, most of the friends he had made on theprevious landing of 1777 were dead.34[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2302] But the conspicuousness ofvice and misery among islanders had led some commentators to erroneous anddangerous conclusions, which Malthus was anxious to refute. Notably, the Frenchradical Abbé Raynal had argued that the population pressures endemic to islandshad made them the cradles of numerous vicious customs that curbed populationthroughout every continent. Europe therefore had the British Isles to thank for“anthropophagy, the castration of males, the infibulation of females, latemarriages, the consecration of virginity, the appropriation of celibacy, thepunishments exercised against girls who become mothers at too early an age,&c.”35 [67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2300] What the Abbé hadfailed to realize was “that a savage tribe in America, surrounded by enemies, ora civilised and populous nation, hemmed in by others in the same state, is inmany respects in a similar situation.”36[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2298] The whole world was like anisland, according to Malthus, in the sense that the barriers to populationgrowth in old states were scarcely less intractable than those afflicting theinhabitants of New Guinea, New Holland, and New Caledonia.Readers of the Essay would have been sensitive to the deep political resonanceof Malthus’s accounts of “primitive life.”37[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2296] By depicting it as “a horridmixture of famine and ferocity,” he sought to counter “the frequent declamationsin favour of savage life” found in radical literature, not least, that ofRaynal, who in his Histoire des deux Indes (1770) had insisted in Rousseauianfashion that the savage life was happier than the civilized. The savage “seldomexperiences . . . that weariness that arises from unsatisfied desires, or thatemptiness and uneasiness of mind that is the offspring of prejudice and vanity.”This comparison obviously had ideological connotations.38[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2294] Even supposing, wrote Raynal,that civilized man was somehow less unhappy than the savage, “there would stillremain a wide difference between the fate of the civilised man and the wildIndian, a difference entirely to the disadvantage of social life. This is theinjustice that reigns in the partial distribution of fortunes and stations; aninequality which is at once the effect and the cause of oppression.”39[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2292] Responding to traveleraccounts that described the natives of Formosa as living in a state of socialequality and engaging in bloodless wars, Malthus asserted that an equaldistribution of property must unleash the power of population by removing thefear of “particular poverty from a large family.” The only means of preservingequality then would be to limit population by law, a measure moreunconscionable, in Malthus’s view, than any of the evils resulting from theinstitution of property.40 [67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2290]Fearing that assertions about the relative equanimity of savage life might havepurchase among a reading public enchanted by traveler accounts of the South SeaIslands, Malthus insisted that visions of plenteous island paradises, like thoseof an idyllic English countryside, were mirages that would disappear on closerinspection. The journal of Captain Cook’s third voyage and accounts from aBritish missionary voyage of 1796–1798 dispelled such myths by revealing thescarcity that stalked the islands at various times of the year.41[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#page_495] This periodic dearthexplained why visitors to the Sandwich Islands experienced none of the profusehospitality offered to the first European guests of the Tahitians. And like thehistories of European states, accounts of fleeting visits to savage kingdomswere liable to focus on the lives of the nobles, since it was they who formedthe greeting parties and attended the welcoming feasts, but while these“principal proprietors” might have plenty of provisions to trade with, it waslikely that “their vassals and slaves were suffering severely from want,”surmised Malthus.42 [67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2287] In savagesocieties where food was abundant, the distinctions of rank were so extreme andenforced so tyrannically that the lives of the lower orders were incomparablywretched. More egalitarian tribes, on the other hand, suffered incessantscarcity and war, and this overbalanced any advantage that might have accrued to“savage life” from their having more leisure time than the laboring poor incivilized countries. Nothing, however, placed the contrast between savage andcivilized life in starker light than their respective modes of education.Whereas the civilized man was taught to nurture fellow feeling and expand thescope for agreeable affections, “Everything that can contribute to teach themost unmoved patience under the severest pains and misfortunes, everything thattends to harden the heart, and narrow all the sources of sympathy, is sedulouslyinculcated in the savage.” Since virtues were like commodities in a market –those in greater demand being produced in greater abundance – “the obviousinference” from these different pedagogies was that while “the civilised manhopes to enjoy, the savage expects only to suffer.”43[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2285]That the contrast between savage and civilized life was so central to Malthus’spurposes in the Essay demonstrates that the first half of the quarto cannot beread as a discreet statement of the facts about population. The historicaldetails were deeply intertwined with his political and social program.44[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2283] Readers who bypassed thefirst half of the book neglected the most powerful evidence that thewell-intentioned expedients for tackling the evils resulting from populationpressure described in books 3 and 4 were doomed to fail, and that only hisrecommendations for their mitigation (i.e., prudential restraint and the gradualabolition of the Poor Laws) could work. The second aim of the historical volumesthen was to establish the demographic principles on which these argumentsturned, and this involved, first of all, discrediting the almost universalassumption that raw birthrates were a measure of national prosperity. Malthusinsisted that high fertility was not even a reliable indicator of increasingpopulation, as by diminishing each person’s portion of subsistence it frequentlyled to soaring mortality. In a nation fearful of French invasion and in which apatriotic chorus exhorted Britons to boost the nation’s power by adding to itsnumbers, it was an assertion as untimely as it was counterintuitive.45[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2281] But here, again, Malthustrusted that a total immersion in the checks to population in “every age” and“every state” would counteract these prejudices, and that having observed therapid succession of human beings (i.e., high birth- and death-rates) among theshepherds of northern Europe in the times of their constant emigrations andamong present-day Abyssinians, readers would approach the second half of thebook with a deep sense of “how little population depends on the birth ofchildren, in comparison of the production of food, and of those circumstances ofnatural and political situation which influence this produce.”46[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2279] Again and again we arepresented with instances of governments or families who encourage breeding, onlyto give rise to surplus population and its attendant vice and misery.47[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2277] In answer to the suggestionthat the dire poverty of large parts of Africa could be ascribed to their sparsepopulation, Malthus observed that a bounty on children would increase war,slavery, and general misery but not the numbers of inhabitants, for populationin such regions already pressed hard on the limits of subsistence. Driving thepoint home in characteristically gruesome fashion, he related how during thefamines that plagued Cairo in 1784–1785, Constantin-François Volney had reportedseeing “under the walls of ancient Alexandria, two miserable wretches seated onthe carcase of a camel, and disputing with the dogs its putrid flesh.”48[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2275]As part of a complex analysis of the natural and political factors affectinglevels of food production – the true cause of population increase – Malthusascribed the sufferings of Egyptians to the despotic government of theMamelukes. Their failure to maintain the ancient irrigation system had crippledagricultural production, and their constant plundering removed all stimulus toindustry and forethought among the people, for no one would accumulate capitalwhere its possession invited destruction.49[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2273] As detrimental as despotismwas to the ratios between population and subsistence, Malthus wanted to showthat well-meaning social policy could be just as pernicious. Mooted as a meansof increasing population and thereby promoting the well-being of the nation, thefoundling hospitals established in Russia in the reign of Catherine the Greatwere a case in point. “All the well-informed men” with whom Malthus discussedthe matter during his visit to Saint Petersburg in 1799 agreed that theseinstitutions greatly encouraged licentiousness by providing a relativelyguilt-free means (in comparison to infanticide) of disposing of unwantedoffspring.50 [67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2271] In this way, notonly were the institutions corrosive to maternal sympathy but they produced alarge proportion of the country’s child mortality. By filling the posts normallytaken by “the legitimate part of the society,” they reduced the price of labor,thereby spreading hardship throughout the working population. Not that thefoundlings themselves prospered. Attendants at the Maison des Enfant Trouvé inSaint Petersburg told Malthus that in the winter of 1798, it had not beenunusual to bury eighteen children a day, and all those he encountered on hisvisit were pale and sickly looking.51[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2269] Such examples were intendedto produce an intuitive sense in the reader that the Poor Laws on the one hand,and the egalitarian solutions examined in books 3 and 4 on the other, weredoomed to fail.52 [67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2267] Malthusforcefully brought home the human cost of such failure by granting intimateaccess to the lives of people who had to live with it.But if by the time the reader gets to book 3 he has imbibed an almostinstinctual sense of how not to promote the national welfare and population, healso has a keen sense of what works. Indeed, while much of book 4 was dedicatedto establishing the expediency of prudential and moral restraint – defined inPaleyan terms as promoting the happiness of mankind “in obedience to the will ofGod” – the foundations for these arguments were laid in the historical accountof population checks. Early in book 1, for example, we are told that theShangalla (Oromo) tribes in western Africa, whose efforts to increase the numberof warriors through polygamy yielded only hardship and misery, would be betteroff concentrating their efforts on rearing just a few children, thus ensuringthat more survived.53 [67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2265] And itwas thanks to precisely this modus operandi that that the sons of Norwegian“house-men” were “fatter, larger, and had better calves to their legs, than boysof the same age and in similar situations in England.”54[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2263] By showing that markedly lowmortality rates occurred where early marriages were relatively rare, theNorwegian case was vital in helping Malthus to verify the efficacy of hispartial remedy. For although he did not say whether he considered the restraintpracticed by Norwegian peasants to be strictly “moral,”55[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2261] the contrast between robustNorwegian children and their emaciated English counterparts put the frustrationsof temporary chastity in moral perspective – poignantly establishing theobligation to practice moral restraint.56[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2259]Aside from providing this comparative perspective, the chapter on Norway(strategically placed at the start of book 2) formed a vital part of thehistorical framework within which Malthus believed the problem of poverty neededto be understood. The persuasive force of Malthus’s utilitarian case for moralrestraint made in book 4 is multiplied manifold when preventive checks areviewed as preservatives of civilization itself. A central plank of this argumentwas that if widely adopted, such checks would greatly diminish war (and eveneliminate it entirely) by removing “one of its first causes and most powerfulimpulses,” “an insufficiency of room and food.”57[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2257] The moral sentiments thatmade fecundity a primary virtue while stigmatizing celibacy created the“redundant” population that supplied ambitious princes with their “instrumentsof destruction,” there being no better recruiting sergeant than want. But thevital argument that such attitudes were a relic of barbarous ages loses much ofits power when divorced from the grisly depictions of “the struggle forexistence” among ancient pastoral and present-day “savage” nations in book 1.58[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2255] The concept of struggle maynot have been fundamental to the principle of population in the way that itwould become to the theory of natural selection, but the picture it conveyed ofthe lives of barbarous peoples was integral to the historical argument thatframes all of Malthus’s utilitarian prescriptions.59[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2253]Malthus’s anticipation of the religious objections to moral restraint were alsoset against this natural historical backdrop, as he asserted that the simplisticinterpretation which saw the divine command to increase and multiply as anincitement to unbridled breeding was also characteristic of less civilizedpeoples and epochs. “A Mahometan,” says Malthus,is in some degree obliged to polygamy from a principle of obedience to hisprophet, who makes one of the greatest duties of man to consist in procreatingchildren to glorify the Creator. Fortunately, individual interest corrects insome degree, as in many other instances, the absurdity of the legislator; andthe poor Arab is obliged to proportion his religious obedience to the scantinessof his resources. Yet still the direct encouragements to population areextraordinarily great; and nothing can place in a more striking point of viewthe futility and absurdity of such encouragements than the present state ofthose countries.60 [67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2251]Malthus goes on to describe the rigid poverty occasioned by such injunctions.These vignettes of human suffering built into a cumulative case for theutilitarian reassessment of some of the most hallowed edicts of scripture, arevision he later justified on the grounds that “every express command given toman by his Creator is given in subordination to those great and uniform laws ofnature which he had previously established.”61[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2249] But the orthodoxies ofnatural law were also subject to reconsideration in the light of historicalscrutiny, most notably the Paleyan conception of practical virtue as consistingprimarily in nurturing charitable instincts. For the natural historical recordconfirmed the view, asserted by Malthus in the first Essay, that the partialaffections were invariably a more reliable guide to right action. Whereas theindiscriminate charity provided by the Lama’s bounty in Tibet had created a“mass of indigence and idleness,” for example, reason pointing out privateinterest had compelled the “poor Arab” to defy wrongheaded religious customs forthe sake of his family.62 [67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2247]The most convincing evidence, however, that the narrower affections were morelikely to illuminate effective ways of diminishing want came again from Norway.The description of the conditions that induced Norwegians to marry later thantheir English counterparts is worth examining more closely, since it provided ablueprint for the widespread operation of preventive checks among the poor. Lowmortality in the Norwegian villages meant that openings for laborers werescarce, and with no large manufacturers to provide an outlet for the excesspopulation of the country side, the Norwegian laborer often had to wait a longtime before he could find a position that would enable him to raise a family.The system of “housemen,” whereby the farmer provided a number of marriedlaborers with small plots of land, and they in return were obliged to work forhim at a low and fixed price when required, provided the only viable opportunityfor the peasant to raise a family.63[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2245] As there were no largemanufacturing towns, nor even an extensive retail trade, to offer them work,young men and women had no option but to remain with the farmer as unmarriedservants until such premises became available. “From the small number of people,and the little variety of employment, the subject is brought distinctly withinthe view of each individual; and he must feel the absolute necessity ofrepressing his inclination to marriage till some such vacancy offer.” In morepopulous countries like England, by contrast, the complexity of the labor marketoccasioned by the greater division of labor meant the subject was shrouded inobscurity, such that “each man naturally thinks that he has as good a chance offinding employment as his neighbour, and that if he cannot get it in one place,he shall in some other.” Trusting to fortune then, the laborer marries, toooften producing a redundant population, replete with malnourished babies andscrawny plowboys.64 [67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2243] What theNorwegian example demonstrated was that the laborer would only desist from suchgambling where he was clear that losing spelled inescapable ruin for his family.Hence, prudential restraint was far less likely to become widespread where therewas a safety net like the Poor Laws.65[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2241] Because the rustic simplicityand demographic sparseness that brought population dynamics “so distinctlywithin the view” of the Norwegian could not be replicated in England, however,those interested in improving the conditions of the poor at home had to call forthe establishment of “a system of general education” to inculcate thefundamentals of political arithmetic, and more generally to cultivate “a spiritof independence” and “decent pride.”66[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2239]This focus on deeply practical objectives helps to explain why, despite itsrichly suggestive analysis of the various stages of civilization, Malthus’s workhas never been regarded as a major contribution to the “natural history of man.”A history exclusively focused on revealing population cycles was never going tooffer conclusions as far reaching as, say, Adam Smith’s account of theretrograde order of economic development followed by European commercialsocieties in book 3 of the Wealth of Nations (1776).67[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2237] Nor, for the same reason nodoubt, was the prediction of the critic from the Monthly Review that Malthus wasdestined to cause “the history of every country, antient and modern, to bepursued with new interest” ever likely to come to fruition.68[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2235] The Essay could not becategorized as a work of “philosophical history” in the tradition of Montesquieuor Edward Gibbon, for while Malthus engaged critically with their respectiveaccounts of the demise of Rome, it was only to challenge their assumptions thatthe barbarian hordes were fueled by “real” rather than redundant population innorthern Europe. Similarly, Malthus did not extrapolate into a broaderanthropology his profound suggestion that scarcity caused by population pressurewas the hidden underlying cause of countless customs, such as polygamy,cannibalism, the exposure of children, and the ferocity of martial codes amongsavages, as well as “the double standard” that ostracized the adulteress “for anoffence, which men commit nearly with impunity” in old states.69[67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2233] Rather, such customs featuredas part of his typology of population checks, as the immediate restraint onincrease, indeed, where food shortages did not express themselves as famine orepidemics.70 [67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2231] In other words,Malthus employed history in the service of practical demography but seldom viceversa.71 [67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2229] But if the Essaydoes not merit study as a work of history, it is clear that the comparativehistorical perspective he labored so hard to provide was vital to his ultimateaim of dispelling the mist concealing the true causes of want in commercialsocieties for the reading public, so that they in turn could put the poorstraight about where their true interests lay. One important implication of thisconclusion, given Malthus’s sources for the Essay, is that an important contextfor the book has been much understudied, that of European overseas explorationand expansion.72 [67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2227] The evidencepresented here also adds weight to Donald Winch’s view that Malthus’s thoughtshared more with the eighteenth-century science of morals, with its focus on thecomplex interrelations between the broad historical determinants of economic andsocial progress, than with the narrower, more technical political economy thatemerged in the 1820s, which aimed at solving the day-to-day problems of economicpolicy.73 [67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2225] But it also placesMalthus in a long line of thinkers, including Locke, Montesquieu, and Voltaire,who appealed to traveler accounts of alien customs to undermine deeply engrainedcultural norms at home.NOTES1 [67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2365].

It would take anotheressay to explore how far Malthus’s interpretation of his sources was shaped byhis political aims, but also how far the views of the travelers themselves wereframed by “anthropological” idioms drawn from political philosophy. Employingdistinctly Hobbesian language, for example, David Collins characterized thenatives of Botany Bay, Port Jackson, and Broken Bay as “living in that state ofnature which must have been common to all men previous to their uniting insociety, and acknowledging but one authority.” Collins, appendix 1, in AnAccount of the English Colony in New South Wales . . . to Which Are Added SomeParticulars of New Zealand (London, 1802), 1:544.38 [67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2293].

While much of his tripwas spent quizzing locals on the details of their home economy and agriculturalpractices, he understandably shied away from enquiring about the prevalence of“irregular gratifications.” For an account of the tour, see Patricia James, ed.,The Travel Diaries of T. R. Malthus (Cambridge, 1966).56 [67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2258]. It is important to beclear about his priorities in this respect. While he strongly encouraged perfectchastity before marriage, Malthus believed that any increase in “the vicesrelating to sex” that might accompany an increase in prudential restraint was aprice worth paying for the reduction in “squalid and hopeless poverty” it wouldoccasion.

In the sensethat his main reason for imagining the universal practice of moral restraint inthis chapter was to reconcile the principle of population with the idea ofdivine benevolence, it is one of the more speculative chapters in the book. Buthe was clearly in earnest in arguing that an increase in prudential checks wouldreduce conflict. The overriding narrative of the Essay, after all, was thatbarbaric customs in relation to population, of which war was the most pervasive,were gradually being supplanted by more rational marital practices.58 [67_Malthus_and_the_History_of_Popul.html#id_2254].

Michael Drake argues thatMalthus’s conclusions were shaped by the fact that he only visited the richerparts of the country in the interior of the south. He also appears to have beenselective in what published statistical data he chose to mention, omittingfigures that did not accord with his claims. See Michael Drake, “Malthus onNorway,” Population Studies, 20, no. 2 (November 1966): 175–196. According toMalthus, Norway also benefited from laws that only permitted Norwegianconscripts to marry on proof of being able to support a family.

Donald Winch shows howthe historical analysis of economic problems was also a feature of Malthus’swritings on political economy. Winch, Malthus (Oxford, 1987), 56."},{"pageContent":"The Tortoise and the HareThomas Robert Malthus as Natural PhilosopherDEBORAH VALENZEOne of the most curious aspects of Thomas Robert Malthus’s Essay on thePrinciple of Population is its pessimistic view of even the most modern methodsof food production. “The power of population is so superior to the power in theearth to produce subsistence for man that, unless arrested by the preventivecheck, premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race,” hereasoned.1 [68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2486] In his notoriouslyclosed system, any attempt to adjust the food supply to fit the number of peopleled inexorably to the need for more food, which was followed only by furtherpopulation growth. “The increasing of the absolute quantity of provisions,” hewrote in 1803, “would appear to be setting the tortoise to catch the hare.”Malthus softened this by adding an important qualification: “Finding thereforethat, from the laws of nature, we could not proportion the food to thepopulation, our next attempt should naturally be to proportion the population tothe food. If we can persuade the hare to go to sleep, the tortoise may have somechance of overtaking her.”2 [68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2484]A homely allusion to Aesop’s tale did not disguise what was, at bottom, anunfriendly message, even though it served as an improvement over other metaphorsoffered up by the Essay on Population. (Malthus would remove his reference to“nature’s mighty feast,” a bountiful table from which the poor would beexcluded, from the 1806 edition.3[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2482]) Persuading the hare “to goto sleep” – that is, discouraging the poor from reproducing – should invite usto ask why Malthus had so little faith in the possibility of harnessing theproductive potential of the natural world. Was this simply a case of jettisoningthe optimism of an earlier age embodied in William Godwin’s An EnquiryConcerning Political Justice? Or was there a particular way in which Malthusviewed the power of nature that explained this essential piece of the Essay onthe Principle of Population?Early critics challenged the geometrical and arithmetical ratios of the Essay,unconvinced by the ninth wrangler from Cambridge, who described himself as aNewtonian. The pseudonymous Piercy Ravenstone fulminated in 1821 that “if . . .the geometrical ratio was admitted on very slight proofs, the arithmetical ratiowas asserted on no evidence at all. . . . It has no being but in the imaginationof its author.” Adjusting Malthus’s metaphor, he identified the true “tortoisewhich supports the elephant” as the dual forces of “liberty” and the “diffusionof knowledge.”4 [68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2480] For somereaders, an abiding belief in progress muted the mathematical register ofMalthus. As a doctor of Manchester pointed out in 1806, why would food be anydifferent from woolens? Rather than leaving an increasing population unclothed,manufacturing would respond by producing more commodities; likewise, agriculture(and perhaps the fishing industry) would develop to meet rising demand.5[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2478]Malthusian views of food production sat uncomfortably with contemporary works onagricultural improvement, which were enjoying popularity during the era of theFrench Revolution. The establishment of the Board of Agriculture in 1793signaled the practical orientation of the times. Arthur Young, as itspublic-spirited spokesperson, employed a style of arithmetic decidedly differentfrom that of the Essay on Population when he first embarked on his tours ofEngland and Wales. The dynamic combination of enclosures and improvementspromised to yield increases of produce by multiples that more than satisfied thedemands of a growing population. “It is not difficult, even on such data as havebeen already obtained,” reported Sir John Sinclair, the president of the board,in 1795, “to make calculations sufficiently accurate for every useful purpose,. . . in regard to income – capital – and population.”6[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2476] Laboring men and women mightpresent an obstacle, not from their reproductive rate but rather from theirclaim to common rights to land use. “Let us not be satisfied with the liberationof Egypt, or the subjugation of Malta,” Sinclair declared in 1803, “but let ussubdue Finchley Common; let us conquer Hounslow Heath; let us compel EppingForest to submit to the yoke of improvement.”7[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2474] The march of progress aimedto vanquish, in Arthur Young’s words, the “Goths and Vandals” of the “openfields.”8 [68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2472]Malthus, however, derived no reassurance from agricultural improvements. When itcame to the possibility of converting pasture to arable land, he adhered to arelentlessly arithmetical (and hypothetical) approach not unlike his method ofcomputing population. In refuting the low estimates of necessary agriculturallabor proposed in Godwin’s Political Justice, Malthus argued that the only wayto meet the needs of double the population “would be from ploughing up most ofthe grazing countries, and putting an end almost entirely to animal food.”Without cattle, he pointed out, Britain would be deprived of sufficient manurefor crop enhancement. Deficiencies would follow. In one of the most famouspassages preserved from the first edition, he calculated the impact of anextension of cultivated land: in their evolution as consumers, the Britishpopulation, driven to a miserable adherence to vegetarianism, would eventuallysuccumb to “the chilling breath of want” and “the whole black train of vices”belonging to a state of perpetual deprivation. “The rosy flush of health givesplace to the pallid cheek and hollow eye of misery” – grim justice for thenation mistakenly dedicated to the task of feeding its fecund population.9[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2470]History was to leave behind this particular debate as economic theory, withcontinuing crucial contributions by Malthus, adopted new strategies of reasoningin the early nineteenth century. By 1815, the law of diminishing returns,derived in part from Malthus’s writings on population, inserted an assumption ofscarcity into formulas involving natural resources; agriculture and miningindustries were thus redefined as belonging to a special category of production.Bringing poor, marginal land into cultivation would only act as a drag oncapital accumulation within the wealthiest class of society. All considerationof the value of agricultural commodities was mediated by a theory of rent shapedby Malthus, David Ricardo, and a new generation of political economists. Theeffect of this was to leave undisturbed the existing terms of Malthus’sdiscussion: the rights of private property, rent, prices, and wages governedsubsequent economic debate. Scarcity in the marketplace thus operated as a checkto ruinous claims of the poor on the resources of landowners.10[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2468]The power of nature over agriculture nevertheless remained as a wild-card withinthe mathematically plotted realm of political economy. Here was Malthus’s meansto a much larger, irrefutable argument about the future of humankind. Accordingto Margaret Schabas, “inescapable laws of nature are essential to the telling ofhis population tale,” and the topic repays closer investigation.11[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2466] Like Adam Smith and thePhysiocrats, Malthus saw agriculture as a primary source of wealth andprosperity, but he viewed its vulnerability to natural forces as a crucialdeterminant of its prospects. “We know from experience that these operations ofwhat we call nature have been conducted almost according to fixed laws,” heargued. “And since the world began, the causes of population and depopulationhave been probably as constant as any of the laws of nature with which we areacquainted.”12 [68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2464] As withnatural history, seasons of blight and adversity figured as inevitable featuresof human history, taking the form of scarcity and deprivation; this wouldcontinue even in the face of modern improvements, removing any guarantee ofkeeping pace with a multiplying population.Historians have explained the absolutism of Malthus’s argument through itsconnection to natural theology, which rendered “the laws of nature” and “thelaws of God” as one.13 [68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2462] If wewant to come to grips with divine power, we are told, we must “turn our eyes tothe book of nature, where alone we can read God as he is.” Or, in a more famousturn of phrase eliminated from the second edition of the Essay, “we shouldreason from nature up to nature’s God and not presume to reason from God tonature.”14 [68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2460] For Malthus andthe Christian political economists who followed him, a reflexive exercise ofcontemplating a sublime divinity led to the conclusion that, in Boyd Hilton’swords, God was “mad, bad, and dangerous” and “does not often meddle” with thecapriciousness of earth’s environmental events. The pummeling of nature was notnecessarily out of character with the notion of a benevolent deity, for suchhardships served as tests of morality and character placed before humankind aspositive opportunities. As Malthus argued in the final two chapters of the firstEssay on Population, the resulting activity, intellectual and physical, promisedto exalt humanity in all its complexity.15[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2458]Even while theology enforced the foundation of the Essay, a particularmethodological orientation enabled Malthus to assume authority and legitimacy inhis argumentation. Here too the intertwining of natural and human historyremained central to his project. Building on the excellent work of Schabas’sNatural Origins of Economics, this essay looks beyond the specific intellectualarguments about nature built into the concerns of political economy to otheraspects of Malthus’s orientation toward natural history.16[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2456] The following examinationrelates his active interest in seeing the world as a theater of natural forcesto a broader social milieu in the final decades of the eighteenth century.Naturalists practiced a daily alertness to meteorology, flora, and fauna, andthey held a conviction that progress entailed a series of identifiable stages ofhistory from ancient to present times. A love of facts drawn from the naturalworld and relentless empiricism gird the arguments of the Essay, characteristicsthat represented reliable data to many of Malthus’s contemporaries. As oneadmirer indicated in 1807, “It is quite delightful to find how closely he hastaught himself to examine the circumstances of the lower classes of society, andwhat a scientific turn he gives the subject.”17[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2454] Malthus’s search for “system”also reflected a naturalist’s yearning for universal categories and laws. Hisreliance on premises drawn from the natural world enabled him to launchoverarching generalizations about the fate of all humanity from very particularcircumstances.As a precocious child, Thomas Robert (always “Bob” among family members) wastrained up as a student of nature from his earliest years. At the head of his“learned” and “accomplished” family was the fascinating figure of DanielMalthus, a well-read man of enlightened and at times radical inclinations.18[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2452] His ardent admiration forJean-Jacques Rousseau fueled occasional decisions to shun convention (such asforbidding his wife to wear a wedding ring) and considerable efforts to courtthe philosopher, which overlap in interesting ways with the formative years ofRobert’s life. No biographer has ever solved the mystery of why the Malthusfamily sold their home soon after Rousseau’s visit to England and “wanderedabout” for the next nineteen years; Daniel Malthus’s intellectual proclivitiessurely had something to do with it. As he wrote to Rousseau after thephilosopher’s departure, he did not share the concerns of typical landlords,and, in the words of Patricia James, “he spent more time in cottages than incastles.” Perhaps it was important to the older Malthus to deny himself (and hishousehold) the complacency and security that would have been expected of personsin possession of their considerable wealth.19[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2450]This devotee of the late enlightenment was intent on guiding the education ofhis second son with a marked degree of precision. From birth, Robert’scongenital cleft palate and hare-lip presented a painful commentary on themysterious workings of nature, but early signs of intellectual gifts clearlyprovided an inspiring consolation to a parent who admired Rousseau. Afterseveral years at a school in Claverton in Somerset (which his brother, Sydenham,older by twelve years, had also attended), Robert was sent to a dissentingacademy at Warrington, and later to the home of Gilbert Wakefield. Wakefield’sfame in the history of radical dissent makes this choice an interesting one: hewas an outspoken critic of the established church, who became a Unitarian andlater a celebrated (and imprisoned) critic of the British government. DanielMalthus, with his philosophical bent, probably applauded Wakefield’s unusuallyliberal pedagogical principles, along with his stellar academic credentials.Distinguished as second wrangler at Cambridge and a scholar of classicalliterature and mathematics, Wakefield enjoyed success as a published author. Theelder Malthus may have viewed Robert, however impeded in his speech, as his ownprivate Émile, and Wakefield’s tutelage offered an unmistakable opportunity.The experiment backfired, at least in part. A remark made by Robert’s goodfriend William (later Bishop) Otter suggests that Malthus “bore few marks andsigns ‘of the scenes and persons to which he had been entrusted for the specificpurposes of education,’” a revealing, if psychologically naive, observation.20[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2448] From these early years,Malthus carved out his own positions resolutely. His first schoolmaster, RichardGraves, captured the paradox of his young charge’s character, which wouldsomeday generate scholarly debate: Malthus hated to offend or upset others(making him the consummate “gentleman,” worthy of defense in the face of publicopprobrium), yet he seemed also “to [love] fighting for fighting’s sake”(rendering him closer to Robert Southey’s characterization as a “mischievousbooby”).21 [68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2446] One wonders ifMalthus’s pointed contrariness galled Wakefield. A strict pacifist, Wakefieldharbored a reverence for nature and gave up fishing because of the pain itinflicted. What must he have thought of young Robert, who repeatedlydemonstrated his relish for shooting while living with the Wakefields, oncecomplaining in a letter to his father that the birds “are so wild, that you canseldom get a shot, & then at a very great distance.”22[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2444]Malthus nevertheless complied in important ways, setting out for Wakefield’sformer college at Cambridge in the autumn of 1784, a move that would leaveimportant imprints on his intellect. “The chief study is mathematics,” Malthusreported to his father, “for all honour in taking a degree depends upon thatscience & the great aim of most of the men is to take an honorable degree.”23[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2442] Their correspondence showshow the issue of the breadth or narrowness of his education was a concern, ashis father (who had never finished his studies at Oxford a generation earlier)strained to understand what his son was doing at university. His chief worrymost likely arose from uncertainty about how Robert, who would inherit no partof the family estate on his father’s death, would support himself in the future.Daniel extended a palm to his son, who felt unsupported in his choice of study,by elaborating his views on mathematics. “There is scarcely any part of learningwhich I esteem more, & all I have ever said to you which cou’d possibly bemisunderstood . . . is that I cou’d always wish to see it applied, & that Idesir’d to see you a surveyor, a mechanic, a navigator, a financier [this lastinserted as an afterthought], a natural philosopher, an astronomer, & [not] ameer speculative algebraist.”24[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2440] Malthus answered by assuringhis father that “I am rather remark’d in College for talking of what actuallyexists in nature, or may be put to real practical use.” More than once, hepointed out that his course of mathematics was not confined to abstractions:“The greatest stress is laid on a thorough knowledge of the branches of naturalphilosophy,” he explained, asking permission “to proceed in my own plan ofreading for the next two years.” “I promise you at the expiration of that timeto be a decent natural philosopher, & not only to know a few principles, but tobe able to apply those principles in a variety of useful problems.”25[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#page_514]Malthus as natural philosopher was already practicing a daily form of scientificobservation, evident in his correspondence with his father and throughout histravel journals: he recorded the weather, along with temperature, and regularlycommented on his observations. This kind of enlightened exercise stretched backfor a century, reflected in Robert Boyle’s widely read General History of theAir (1692), which taught readers how to integrate temperature, pressure, andhumidity into a broader search for the effects of the air. John Locke appendedto that volume “a portion of his own weather diary, indicating that a Baconiannatural history could take the form of a chronological record of weatherphenomena.”26 [68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2437] According tohistorian Vladimir Jankovic´, a growing number of lower-rung “clericalnaturalists” who recorded meteorological data in the eighteenth century may havebeen trying to enhance their profiles in the eyes of potential patrons.27[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2435] Malthus’s elementaryapplications of what he knew about weather placed him among the dilettanti,particularly in the way he employed a deus ex machina in his narrative ofnatural occurrences. Among more serious students of nature, the second half ofthe century generated a keener sense of professional practices in science, inwhich “quantification displaced the narratives of meteoric tradition, averageswere more relevant than extremes, and recurring phenomena more telling thansingularities.” But meteorologists had not yet hammered out general lawsgoverning the atmosphere, rules similar to “Newton’s accomplishments incelestial mechanics.” Lacking a governing paradigm in earth science, weatherdiarists like Malthus were free to interpret natural disasters according toframeworks of causality of their own choosing.28[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2433]The fact that Malthus saw himself as a natural philosopher in a truth-seekingage, offering observations from a laboratory writ large, places him squarelyamong a late eighteenth-century generation of gentlemanly naturalists. Anearlier generation engaged in enthusiastic combing of field and forest (alongwith far-flung colonial landscapes) in order to catalogue botanical specimensaccording to England’s own guide, John Ray, as well as the rising star of CarlLinnaeus. “Natural History is now, by a kind of national establishment, becomethe favourite study of the time,” proclaimed the Critical Review in 1763. Theestablishment of botanic gardens in Cambridge and Kew underscored theinstitutional support for such activity, vital and popular by the time ofMalthus’s years at university. This was an era of nature-clubbing and fieldexcursions, along with a growing interest in geology and its power to reveal the“majestic unfolding of Creation’s inexorable plan.”29[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2431] By the 1790s, natural historyin all its forms inflated the sails of the Romantic movement, evident in aburgeoning passion for Rousseau’s sojourns in the outdoors, Thomas Gray’spoetry, and Edmund Burke’s writings on the sublime. For the more empiricallyoriented, like Malthus, the trend toward sensibility spelled a diversion fromaccurate observation and less comfortable truths. In his reaction to Godwin,Malthus would marshal a distinctly rational approach to human nature combinedwith a renovated empiricism, what we might consider a nascent form of socialscience. Unlike the rationality associated with the late Enlightenment, however,his was a decidedly unsentimental and blunt instrument.30[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2429]An insistence on “what actually exists in nature” captures the spirit ofMalthus’s endeavor when, years later, he set upon Godwin’s Political Justice asthe fertile text from which he would generate his famous principle. In the firstedition and more systematically in the second, Malthus mocked what he believedto be Godwin’s chimerical construction of human nature, which, he objected, hadno basis in observed behavior. His most trenchant statements about nature oftenappeared in conjunction with his descriptions of the twin forces of population,the “passion between the sexes” and the impact of natural and social forces onhuman offspring once they were born. “Since the world began, the causes ofpopulation and depopulation have been probably as constant as any of the laws ofnature with which we are acquainted,” he argued.31[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2427] Nature “will not, cannot, bedefeated in her purposes.” Its workings were inseparable from theologicalimperatives: it acted “like a kind though sometimes severe instructor, with theintention of teaching us to make all parts strong, and to chase vice and miseryfrom the earth.” No matter what high-minded ideals informed the projects ofphilosophers like Godwin (and Rousseau, we might add), these were, in AdamSmith’s words, the “impotent endeavors of man.”32[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2425]Critics have had no trouble pointing out that the young man who wrote the firstEssay had not seen much of the world in either its human or plant variety. Oncehis pamphlet had reached the public and created a stir, Malthus may have feltsome belated humility. He most likely had little direct knowledge of the fixedlaws of nature in the realm of sexuality. As Gail Bederman brilliantly argues,his agitated marginalia suggest that his anxiety in reading Godwin and MaryWollstonecraft, particularly Godwin’s account of sexual freedom, may well havefueled the bold and somewhat cavalier argumentation in the first edition. Thissame preoccupation may similarly account for his considerable recklessness inmarshalling data. By his own account, Malthus had dashed off the first Essaywith few books to hand. Now that his argument was, in a sense, history, heembarked on a mission to reinforce it with hard data from “what actually existsin nature.”33 [68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2423]The remainder of this essay looks at two paths of research into the naturalworld used by Malthus in revising the Essay. As footnotes in the 1803 editionindicate, Malthus adopted a scholarly approach, enlisting evidence drawn frombooks on environmental conditions affecting food supplies. A brief examinationof two works sheds light on Malthus’s catastrophic mode of thought and itsconnection to the weather and the natural world. Secondly, consideration ofMalthus’s tour of Scandinavia shows how he was determined to go beyond merebook-learning to bolster his case. In 1799, he and two Cambridge friends,William Otter and Daniel Clarke, along with a pupil of Clarke, embarked on atour of Scandinavia. The outbreak of the French Revolution, which limited travelon the Continent, suggested the alternative itinerary, which took them firstthrough Germany and Denmark, then northward into Sweden and Norway.34[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2421] To the budding theorist ofpopulation, the rugged landscape of Scandinavia, less well known to the educatedpublic, held particular advantages. Untrammeled by agricultural improvers,inhabited by simple peasants versed in the ways of nature, the region offeredMalthus the hope of gleaning information on reproduction and survival shaped byminimal interference of modernizing forces. This was worthwhile informationindeed to the assiduous student of nature.“As the frost detains you in Town, and me in the country; and as you were sokind as to make an offer of services . . . I will mention a few books which ifyou should hear of at any of the booksellers where you happen to call, I wishyou would get for me,” Malthus wrote to his father in London in February 1799.His list included items on population in German, French, Dutch, and English, andmay also have yielded the copy of Benjamin Franklin’s Works that resides now inthe Jesus College Library.35 [68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2419]Malthus obviously had other means of obtaining books and pamphlets, many ofwhich do not appear in the Cambridge library, yet nevertheless supplied him withthe data he desired for his expanded second edition. In his search forperiodical checks to population, he mined the pages of Thomas Short’s two-volumeGeneral Chronological History of the Air, Weather, Seasons, Meteors, &c. (1749)and his New Observations . . . on . . . Bills of Mortality (1750). TheScottish-born doctor was an energetic advocate of the “empiric” method, which hedefined as a necessary combination of reason and observation. Without thelatter, he argued, reason is simply “wrangling.” Short moved south to Sheffieldand devoted his career to the study of fluids, particularly waters, but he alsotheorized about air, arguing that wind was the primary communicant of disease.For Short, the weather patterns of the globe were merely handmaidens of alarger, comprehensive system that science might discern through its enlightenedmethodologies. The “God of Nature most certainly has the Universe in his ownHands, and can dispose of his Creatures as he sees proper, either for theDestruction or Relief of Mankind,” Short offered in the preface to his Historyof Air.36 [68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2417] As the author of AComparative History of the Increase and Decrease of Mankind (1767), it is notsurprising that his work came to Malthus’s attention. Short’s argument – thatearlier marriages were beneficial to humankind – was no doubt less congenial toMalthus than Short’s methodology. Malthus ultimately stood the doctor’s argumenton its head. But such arguments about the influence of extraordinary weather onhumankind harmonized perfectly with Malthus’s own views of the natural world.In both works, Short’s approach to natural history was encyclopedic, his pictureof nature’s workings endlessly punishing. The twenty-first-century reader mayregister something like surprise in perusing the good doctor’s findings in hisHistory of the Air. Beginning with Genesis, he collated information oncatastrophic weather and peculiar celestial occurrences across the globe. His“Chronological Table” detailed “Unnatural Rains, Dews, or other Downfalls,”including an occurrence in Rome in 3736 “A.M. [Anno Mundi],” in which “Milkrained from the Clouds and watered the Earth like Rain.” Closer to home, in theyear 688 A.D., it “Rained Blood 7 days together through all Britain” and “Milk,Cheese, Butter turned to Blood.” In 1014, “A Heap of Clouds fell, and smotheredThousands.”37 [68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2415] Data on plaguesand other less easily categorized events followed. More credibly, hedemonstrated the absence of causality linking comets and meteors to outbreaks ofdisease in the more modern era. And in New Observations, he used recent,quotidian information to demonstrate a direct link between extreme weatheroccurrences and mortality from disease. Grasping at a bigger picture, Malthusfastened on Short’s pungent characterization of these spectacular events –“terrible correctives of the redundance of mankind” – and employed the phrase inhis second edition.38 [68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2413]Short’s peculiar tables on famines and plagues appealed to Malthus and suppliedsupporting evidence for the revised Essay. Malthus simply tabulated the numberof total years covered by Short’s tables and divided the result by the number ofplagues catalogued, arriving at a rate of epidemics “at the interval of about4-1/2 years.”39 [68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#page_515] As Malthushad explained in the first edition in a particularly vehement paragraph that wasto vanish after 1807, “Famine seems to be the last, the most dreadful resourceof nature.” Much more powerful are “the vices of mankind” as “active and ableministers of depopulation.” He added, “But should they fail in this war ofextermination, sickly seasons, epidemics, pestilence, and plague, advance interrific array, and sweep off their thousands and ten thousands. Should successbe still incomplete, gigantick inevitable famine stalks in the rear, and, withone mighty blow, levels the population with the food of the world.”40[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2410]Historians have been at pains to explain how such a catastrophic view of theconditions under which human society perpetuated itself could have been brewingin the mind of this seemingly placid young curate living at home with hisparents. Besides its utter simplification (lacking any sense of medical orenvironmental improvements that might cushion the effects of physicalmisfortunes), such argumentation seemed to associate Malthus with the decriersof dark satanic mills in the industrial north. Social historians reexamining theEssay have linked his grim predictions to the deleterious effects ofurbanization on the poor. Another explanatory strategy has pointed to the factthat within the span of Malthus’s life, Britain had spent many years at war.41[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2408] It is certainly true that theyear 1795 provided direct evidence of wartime scarcity, but Malthus took thismisery-inducing circumstance one step further: a key factor that year was badweather that accentuated already existing shortages. Here was a direct exampleof his careful choreography of one bad thing leading to another. Too many peoplebearing down on food supplies, particularly among the poor, “turns even a slightdeficiency from the failure of the seasons into a severe dearth; and may befairly said, therefore, to be one of the principal causes of famine.”42[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2406]Malthus was not imagining the intrusive power of European weather patternsduring the eighteenth century. Works like Short’s New Observations, written atmidcentury, most likely reflected the experiences of markedly cold winters andrecent episodes of extreme weather. As a Scot, Short’s sensitivity tometeorological calamity could have sprung from events close to home. A sizeablediminution of upland cultivation took place in southern Scotland, apparent bythe eighteenth century; cool summers caused consecutive harvest failures,particularly of oat crops, and thus changed the map of Scottish food productionby forcing the abandonment of farms in upper elevations.43[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2404] Malthus would have had notrouble finding evidence of catastrophic events in the earlier part of thecentury, such as the freeze of 1709, which reduced the area devoted to olivecultivation in France, or the subsistence crisis in Switzerland that qualifiedas a famine in 1770–1771. The year 1771 witnessed “an extremely snowy summer”across Europe, and weather historians have demonstrated that the 1780s was anotably weather-beaten decade.44[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2402] “Placed at a critical phaseduring the closing stages of the Little Ice Age, the 1780s contain a number ofoutstanding temperature and rainfall extremes, . . . which must represent somevery pronounced regional anomalies,” John Kington argued in his collation ofdata from eighteenth-century observers. One factor promoting coolness was anincrease in volcanic activity after 1780, which added dust to the upperatmosphere. Malthus himself had noted the unusually low temperatures of thatdecade in his correspondence with his father; both men watched theirthermometers and remarked on the effects of the cold. “Then, as now,” Kingtonpoints out, “an apparent increase in the variability of weather and climate fromseason to season and year to year was causing concern.”45[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2400]Malthus’s meteorological interests, as part of his general awareness of thepower of nature, played a role in his tour of Scandinavia. In his search fordata, Norway would provide him with a test case of how populations might bestrespond to the pummeling of nature. There, in a nation carved out of the upperlatitudes, he found the correct balance between nature and prudential restraint.“Even in Norway, notwithstanding the disadvantage of a severe and uncertainclimate,” he wrote in the 1803 edition of the Essay,I am inclined to think that the poor were, on the average, better off than inEngland. Their houses and clothing were superior and, though they had no whitebread, they had much more meat, fish, and milk than our labourers. . . . Thisdegree of happiness, superior to what could be expected from the soil andclimate, arises almost exclusively from the degree in which the preventive checkto population operates.46 [68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2398]In fact, as Michael Drake has shown from the 1801 census, fertility measures atthe time were high, indicating that preventive checks were not at all whatMalthus thought them to be. Malthus’s complete faith in his idiosyncraticinterviews with contacts in Norway and Sweden led to several incorrectassumptions about deterrents to early marriage.47[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2396] Once back in England, he alsodrew selectively from statistical works, concluding that in Norway, “mortality[was] less than in any other country in Europe.” This assertion, too, wasincorrect; so-called positive checks had kept the Norwegian population fromgrowing, and only when the diminution of disease and infantile morbiditydeclined in the first half of the nineteenth century would the number of peoplerise.48 [68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2394]It seems counterintuitive that Malthus, with his bleak portrait of naturalforces plaguing humankind, should make such inaccurate and even optimisticjudgments about Norway. By his own account, the country endured “eight months ofwinter, [and] four months of bad weather.”49[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2392] What are we to make of thisaberration of the “population story”? This was his first tour of a landscape andculture outside of England, and references to the “picturesque” and “sublime”suggest that he was determined to put a learned sensibility to the test. We knowthat he had read Mary Wollstonecraft’s account of Sweden and Norway,50[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2390] but crucial to the secondedition of the Essay was his reading of Bishop Erich Pontoppidan’s NaturalHistory of Norway, translated from the Danish and published in England in 1755,along with William Coxe’s Travels into Poland, Russia, Sweden, and Denmark (4thed., 1792).51 [68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2388] Malthus’sfindings on tour consistently confirm the arguments of these two works in theirextravagant praise of Norwegian peasants; in many cases, his journal mirrors thevery evidence used by Pontoppidan and Coxe. More important was the apparentproof they offered that in this vivid laboratory of nature, hard work andprudential restraint would save humankind from misfortune.Pontoppidan’s extraordinary two-volume work, a paean to the wonders of thenatural world, included a bold and affirmative assessment of “the Norwegiannation.” The common people received high marks for their “good appearance,”their height and bravery, their light complexion (particularly among the women),“civility,” “courteous behavior,” and cheerfulness, even when doing “the work ofhorses.” Their politeness reminded Pontoppidan of the French, while their loveof “fine cloaths” and “elegant houses” proved that they “endeavour to imitate”the English, though he added that they were far more hospitable and friendlythan that island nation. Their health was generally faultless, except for thoseaffected by the dampness of coastal areas; their simple diet gave rise to manyinstances of astonishing longevity. Above all, the Norwegian peasant, in hisenviable “state of liberty,” showed a determination “to live independent ofothers, and without being in any body’s debt.” A critic of the English poorwould find these traits indeed praiseworthy.52[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2386]Perhaps most remarkable was Pontoppidan’s description of a forward-looking,self-help approach to times of scarcity, said to be common among peasants in thenorth:If grain be scarce, which generally happens after a severe winter, the peasantsare obliged to have recourse to an old custom, as a disagreeable, but suremethod of preserving life. Their bread, in time of scarcity, is made thus, theytake the bark of the fir-tree, boil it and dry it before the fire, then theygrind it to meal and mix a little oatmeal with it; of this mixture, they make akind of bread, which has a bitterness and a resinous taste, and does not affordthat nourishment, that their usual bread does. However, there are some people,that think it is not right to disuse this sort of bread entirely, and even inplentiful years they sometimes eat a little of it, that they may be preparedagainst a time of scarcity, which by the goodness of providence, does not happenin a century.53 [68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2384]In fact, the end of the eighteenth century proved to be one such time whenpeasants resorted to the notorious substitute. Bark bread, Malthus discovered onhis tour, was sustaining peasants near Magnor at the border of Sweden, where anotably poor harvest had left “above thirty families” without oat bread for thefirst eight months of 1799. Malthus “collected some specimens,” which boastedonly a sprinkling of “a little oat flower.” Ever the evidence-collector, he alsonoted that “the white bark of the best red firs is used for bread” and that“many of the finest trees are spoilt in this way.”54[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2382]Clearly, the Norwegian peasant was one with nature. Malthus expressed wondermentat other practices that blended the inhabitants of this brisk climate with thelandscape, such as dwellings with flat roofs topped with grass and sod, where hewitnessed sheep grazing or villagers busily mowing hay. He registered a mixtureof interest and dismay in the native attachment to oatcakes and milk. Afterweeks of refusing to eat the local bread, he dutifully consumed an oat biscuitand assiduously recorded its consistency as “more of chaff, than of oatmeal.”Although he struggled to make sense of the scanty shifts commonly worn by women,also noted by Coxe and Pontoppidan (was it poverty or immodesty that had causedthem to dress so minimally in chilly temperatures?), he regularly recordedglimpses of bare bodies beneath their folds. Malthus made his journal reflect asmuch of his empirical philosophy as possible, not knowing that the science hewas approximating was late Enlightenment ethnography.55[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2380]In his role as natural philosopher, Malthus strained to collect as much harddata as possible. Each day, we hear of his familiar practice of recording thetemperature twice and sometimes three and even four times. “Clouds low, misling[drizzling] rain at times,” he wrote on 8 July; “at 9 in the evening a hardshower. Therm at half past 6 in the morning, 62; at 1, 65; at half past 7,60.”56 [68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2378] At the prospect ofbeautiful Lake Wennerlind, the ever-zealous Malthus promptly plunged histhermometer into the water and recorded it at 61 degrees at eleven in themorning on 21 June. “Observed at Wennerburgh an apple tree in full blossom –rather late.”57 [68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2376] He was notimmune to natural wonders: “Saw by far the most brilliant rainbow that I eversaw in my life,” he enthused at one point, adding a painstaking description ofits double character and “stripes.” We can feel his “extreme mortification”when, on 1 August, he found his thermometer broken.58[68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2374]Malthus’s other textual guide, Coxe’s Travels, informed him of a Norwegianpractice of conscripting young men between the ages of sixteen and twenty-six.By the time Malthus toured the countryside, the strategy had been largelyabandoned, but at least one of his hosts confirmed its existence, misleading thephilosopher into believing that the institution of military service delayedmarriage and thus reduced the number of children born to Norwegian peasants.Another customary arrangement impressed him by its stewardship: farmers providedlodging to unmarried servants and cottages and land to married male servants(husmen). At Drivthuen, he witnessed a particularly lavish breakfast takingplace, which later bore the weight of his argument about prudential restraint.Seven men were feasting onfried bacon & veal, some fried fish, large bowls of milk, & oak cake and butter.Each had his knife & fork & spoon – the bowls of milk were in common. Weenquired of the master of the house afterwards whether they were all his men –he said they were, and lived in his house, besides others. He had, he said, 20altogether in family. . . . None of the men that lived with him were married.. . . The establishments of the farmers in this country appear to be much largerthan with us, and it is probable that the sons of housemen & small farmersbecome the servants of farmers, and do not marry till they are able to obtain ahouseman’s place.59 [68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2372]Sample Norwegian census returns from 1801 show no farms hosting twentyservants.60 [68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2370] Yet this powerfulencounter convinced Malthus of a method of strict paternal oversight that keptreproductive rates at a minimum. The scene offered many powerful symbols to thewide-eyed Malthus: the meat and fish, the communal bowls of milk, the heartyall-male camaraderie amounted to the wish-list of a latter-day anthropologist,and also the perfect ammunition for the second edition of the Essay. Work hard,be obedient and chaste, and you will eat well, it promised, even in the face ofbelligerent weather and a fearsome climate.With a whiff of Aesop, the tortoise and hare revealed more about the moralityinforming the second Essay than any likely prediction of how agriculture mightperform in an increasingly commercial world. Malthus’s understanding of rurallife, supported by his empirical natural philosophy, belonged to a universe inwhich nature held the trump card capable of negating all efforts to matchagricultural output with the level of population. Over time, the fury ofMalthus’s concept of nature diminished, as it hovered over a carefully plannednotion of economic life only distantly related to the communal table in Norway.Later editions of the Essay implied that the blows of catastrophe might beavoided, as its author recognized the power of human nature to respond toincentives and rewards. Malthus was much less the natural philosopher and muchmore the political economist by then, though he never abandoned his advocacy ofmoral restraint.61 [68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2368] Hisdepiction of the inexorable laws of nature would support sweeping argumentsabout population and poverty for many years, despite the peculiar circumstancesthat gave birth to his views.NOTES1 [68_The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare__Thoma.html#id_2485].

A. WRIGLEYThe three most eminent among the classical economists shared a common belief inthe impossibility of bringing about an era in which there was exponential growthin the output of material goods. The reason was simple. All material productioninvolved land, labor, and capital. Of these it was reasonable to suppose thatthe supply of labor and capital could, in suitable circumstances, be increasedas required, but the supply of land was fixed. This implied an insuperableproblem associated with increasing production. If output was to rise, more landmust be taken into cultivation, but, since the best land would already be inuse, this meant exploiting land of poorer quality. Alternatively, existing landcould be used more intensively, or the two expedients might be combined. In anyevent, even allowing for the possibility of improvements in technology, returnsboth to labor and capital must decline and growth would be arrested. In short,the very process of growth ensured its eventual cessation.1[69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_1469]In considering this conclusion it is important to note that land was not justthe source of food but also of virtually all the raw materials which enteredmaterial production. The productivity of the land set limits not just to thescale of food supply but also of industrial production. This is self-evidentlytrue of raw materials such as cotton, wool, silk, leather, and wood but also, ifindirectly, of all metals since the smelting of the ores from which the metalswere derived required much heat, and the heat in question came from the burningof wood and charcoal. Adam Smith depicted the nature of the economies of his dayas follows:The great commerce of every civilised society, is that carried on between theinhabitants of the town and those of the country. It consists in the exchange ofrude for manufactured produce. . . . The country supplies the town with themeans of subsistence, and the materials of manufacture. The town repays thissupply by sending back a part of the manufactured produce to the inhabitants ofthe country. The town, in which there neither is nor can be any reproduction ofsubstances, may very properly be said to gain its whole wealth and subsistencefrom the country.2 [69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_1471]Sir Thomas More encapsulated the nature of the fundamental problem facing allsuch organic economies in his famous comment in Utopia that the sheep wereeating up the men: if the output of raw wool was to be increased, this must meanless land available to grow corn.3[69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_1473] David Ricardo drove home theimpossibility of escaping this problem at the end of his discussion of theinevitability of declining returns to capital and labor by noting, “This willnecessarily be rendered permanent by the laws of nature, which have limited theproductive powers of the land.”4[69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_1475] It was not defects in humaninstitutions or an inadequate legal framework or human frailties that lay behindthis gloomy conclusion: it was a feature of the natural world and beyond remedy.Malthus shared with the other classical economists the same concern about theimplications of the impossibility of overcoming the ceiling set to materialproduction by the limited amount of cultivable land, but he added a furtherconsideration that reinforced and extended this concern. As a young man inCambridge he had studied mathematics and was familiar with the possibility ofexpressing a problem in mathematical terms. He depicted the nature andseriousness of the problem in a way that his critics found difficult to dismiss.He suggested that even on the most optimistic of assumptions it was impossibleto suppose that any achievable rise in agricultural output could exceed anarithmetic progression, whereas it was rational to assume that populations wouldgrow by geometric progression unless constrained by inadequate resources. Giventhe nature of the two progressions, tension between production and populationwas unavoidable. Except in areas where for a time the cultivable area could beexpanded as fast as population grew, as in the young United States, livingstandards must be in danger of being reduced close to bare subsistence by adeteriorating balance between numbers and available nutrition. This insight ofMalthus has not only proved of great value in studying all preindustrial,organic societies but has also proved to have a much wider relevance. It wasreading Malthus’s Essay that suggested to Charles Darwin a force which woulddrive the process of natural selection. Only a proportion of each risinggeneration of young plants, animals, fish, birds, or insects would survive toreproduce, and those that were successful in doing so would be the ones bestadapted to meet the challenges presented by the environment in which they lived.In the first Essay Malthus was concerned to drive home the implications of thisinsight in order to refute the views of men such as William Godwin and theMarquis de Condorcet, who believed that a radical improvement of the humancondition could be achieved by institutional change and altered personalmotivations. Malthus expressed his views trenchantly and with fewqualifications. As time passed, however, he became increasingly alive to theimportance of an issue to which he had referred in the first Essay and which wastreated at length in the later versions of the work. Although population growth,in his analysis, must always be arrested by the difficulties of expandingoutput, it did not follow that the growth would always cease at the same size ofpopulation. He emphasized the importance of the distinction between the“positive” and “preventive” checks. The significance of this distinction isperhaps easiest to appreciate by presenting it in graphical form, as in figure 1[69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_2494].In the upper half of figure 1[69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_2494], three combinations offertility and mortality are shown, each of which results in population ceasingto grow. In the lower half the implications for living standards of each of thethree possibilities are shown. F1 shows a high level of fertility, which doesnot change as population growth continues. Eventually mortality, M, rises to thesame level, but only when population has reached a total which implies (P1) thatliving standards have been driven down to a low level. If fertility is at alower level but is also invariant as population rises, as in the case of F2, theintersection with M occurs at a somewhat smaller population total, whichtherefore results in a less severely depressed standard of living (P2). If,however, fertility is responsive to reduced living standards (F2a) and declinesin sympathy, population growth will cease earlier and still higher livingstandards will result (P2a). F1 depicts the situation that might arise in asociety in which marriage was early and universal, with women normally marryingsoon after reaching sexual maturity. Here the positive check alone brings growthto a halt, and the population lives close to what is sometimes termed theMalthusian precipice. F2 represents a variant that might describe the situationif marriage normally occurred later in life and where some men and women nevermarried. In this case rising mortality brings population to a stop at a lowertotal than in the case of F1 with benefit to living standards, even thoughfertility remains constant as population totals rise. However, if marriage agerises with deteriorating economic prospects, and a larger fraction of eachrising generation remains single throughout life, the resultant reduction infertility (F2a), by arresting growth at a still earlier point, preserves livingstandards even more effectively. F1 may be taken as exemplifying the perils thatmust arise if the positive check is the sole influence determining at what pointpopulation growth comes to an end. F2a shows the benefits that can be achievedif the preventive check is effective.5[69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_1477][../img/552_1.png]Figure 1. Fertility, mortality, and living standards. Reprinted with permissionfrom E. A. Wrigley, Continuity, Chance and Change: The Character of theIndustrial Revolution in England, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988),21.The world in which Malthus lived and the problems that were then prominent wereboth very different from the situation in today’s world. In order to understandand at the same time to do justice to the views that Malthus expressed, it isessential to take this point into account. As already noted, for example, it wasgenerally assumed that there was a ceiling set by the limited supply of land tothe scope for increased material production. Although the immediate problem inthis analysis is the fixed supply of land, the underlying problem is energysupply. Both heat energy and mechanical energy in organic economies are derivedalmost exclusively from plant photosynthesis. The annual quantum of plant growthresulting from such photosynthesis, therefore, is almost the sole source of theenergy needed for all forms of material production.6[69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_1479] This fact set a ceiling tothe possible output of types of material production that were energy intensive.As an example, even if half the land surface of Britain were devoted towoodland, the annual yield of wood and charcoal would only suffice to produceabout 1-1/4 million tons of bar iron on a sustained yield basis.7[69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_1481]Crucial to overcoming the barrier that made exponential growth in materialproduction impossible was the increasing importance of a new source of energy inthe form of coal. Coal itself is the product of photosynthesis, but in this caseaccumulated over hundreds of millions of years, whereas organic societies hadaccess each year only to the product of photosynthesis in that year.8[69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_1483] It is a striking example ofthe difficulty the classical economists had in realizing the significance of thechanges which were in train in their midst that Adam Smith, in noting howindustry was increasingly clustering on the coalfields, attributed this trendprincipally to the fact that wage costs were lowered on the coalfields becausecoal provided a cheap source of domestic heating! 9[69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_1485]The belief that sustained growth was out of the question is so foreign to theworld of the twenty-first century that it may stand in the way of appreciatingwhat was taken for granted in Malthus’s day. Again, we take it as a matter ofcourse that fertility both within marriage and more generally is readilycontrolled, and there is as much concern about the problems that societies faceif fertility falls below the replacement level as about the dangers of excessivefertility. If, however, intercourse always carries the risk of pregnancy and yetit seems essential to control fertility levels, the available options are verylimited. During her fecund years a married woman was always at risk to becomepregnant. This implied that influencing nuptiality was the only practical methodof controlling fertility.When Malthus wrote the first Essay he was, so to speak, arguing from firstprinciples, a fact that gave a particular cogency to the views he expressed. Thelater editions of the Essay were much longer and not without their longueurs,but the core argument remains the same in all of them. It may be helpful todescribe the core argument further before commenting on its relation to othertopics that attracted his attention, notably the Poor Laws.Given the difference between the rates of growth in arithmetic and geometricprogressions, there was a constant danger that excessive population growth wouldforce down the living standards of the bulk of the population, since anexcessive supply of labor would reduce wages for those fortunate enough to findemployment and also increase the risk of unemployment. In a peasant economy inwhich the play of the market was less important, subdivision of holding wouldproduce a similar result. Mortality rates rose when the population size becameexcessive because nutritional levels declined and living conditions generallydeteriorated. In a sense mortality could be regarded as a given; even if it werereduced for a time by human intervention, the resulting rise in the rate ofpopulation growth must generate the additional pressures associated withexcessive numbers. Fertility was different. Reducing it could bring clearbenefits, as illustrated in figure 1[69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_2494].10[69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_1487] Moreover, if fertilityremained low, improvements secured in this way were capable of being retainedrather than being dissipated in the long run. Success in reducing andcontrolling fertility levels could only be achieved by limiting nuptiality.Ceteris paribus, where women married at, say, age twenty-five on average,fertility levels would be substantially lower than where the average age atmarriage was eighteen. Similarly, if many men and women never married fertilitywould be lower than if marriage was universal. Limiting nuptiality was the onlyway to avoid excessive population pressure and a reduction in living standards.In expounding the advantages that might flow from the preventive check, Malthusshowed himself, despite his reputation, to be less pessimistic than Adam Smithwho wrote, “Every species of animals naturally multiplies in proportion to themeans of their subsistence, and no species can ever multiply beyond it. But inevery civilized society it is only among the inferior ranks of people that thescantiness of subsistence can set limits to the further multiplication of thehuman species; and it can do so in no other way than by destroying a great partof the children which their fruitful marriages produce.” 11[69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_1489]The key issue in Malthus’s view was to encourage prudence when contemplatingmarriage. A man was not justified in contracting a marriage unless satisfiedthat he possessed the resources needed to support his wife and the children bornto the marriage. Malthus was therefore stridently, at times bitterly, opposed tothe English Poor Laws system, which, in affording support to a family indistress, adjusted the scale of support according to the number of children inthe family, if the family were large. This practice, in his view, encouragedimprovident marriages since it removed a consideration that would otherwise haveinduced greater caution on the part of men contemplating matrimony. As he put itin the first Essay:I entirely acquit Mr Pitt of any sinister intention in that clause of the PoorBill which allows a shilling a week to every labourer for each child he hasabove three. I confess, that before the bill was brought into Parliament, andfor some time after, I thought that such a regulation would be highlybeneficial; but further reflection on the subject has convinced me, that if itsobject be to better the condition of the poor, it is calculated to defeat thevery purpose which it has in view.12[69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_1491]With the benefit of hindsight there is good reason to have doubts about severalaspects of Malthus’s attitude to the Poor Laws. One weakness in his argument wasevident in his own day. To urge that a man should not contemplate marriageunless he was confident that he could support a wife and children only makessense if it is possible in advance to calculate the approximate size of theprospective commitment. But a most important element in the prospective expenseinvolved, perhaps the largest single element, turns on the number of childrenborn to the marriage and whether or not they die in infancy and childhood. Giventhe scale of the intrinsic uncertainties in this regard, although the principleinvolved may be sound, it does not afford a practical basis for decision-making.In the penultimate chapter of the second edition of the Essay, Malthus somewhatbelatedly recognized the problem and partially modified his stance. Havingsuggested that if it were the case that men based their calculation of making aprudential marriage on the assumption that they might have to support as many assix children, and in a given case the offspring proved more numerous, hesuggested that “in this case I do not think that any evil would result frommaking a certain allowance to every child above this number; not with a view ofrewarding a man for his large family, but merely of relieving him from a speciesof distress which it would be unreasonable in us to expect that he shouldcalculate upon.”13 [69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_1493]Malthus was also ready to concede that there were other circumstances in whichthe existence of the Poor Laws had proved of great social benefit. This isapparent in his second publication, a pamphlet entitled “An Investigation of theCause of the Present High Price of Provisions,” which, like the first Essay, waspublished anonymously. “An Investigation” was also a remarkable piece of work inother ways. It displayed, for example, his ability both to detect an apparentparadox and to resolve it. In 1799, Malthus had made a lengthy tour throughNorway and Sweden, and on his return to England discovered that there waswidespread alarm about the level to which the price of bread had risen. Duringhis journey through western Sweden in the province of Värmland he had seen verysevere distress in the wake of harvest failure. The people were reduced tosubsisting on dried sorrel and powdered tree bark. Suffering was greater thanany experienced in England: “Yet as far as we could learn, the price of rye,which is the grain principally used for bread, had not risen above double itsusual average; whereas in this country last year, in a scarcity that must beacknowledged to be greatly inferior in degree, wheat rose to above three timesits former price.”14 [69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_1495]Malthus’s explanation of this paradox was essentially the same as that ofAmartya Sen when commenting on similar phenomena in recent years.15[69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_1497] Malthus wrote,To proceed to the point: I am most strongly inclined to suspect, that theattempt in most parts of the kingdom to increase the parish allowances inproportion to the price of corn, combined with the riches of the country, whichhave enabled it to proceed as far as it has done in this attempt, is,comparatively speaking, the sole cause, which has occasioned the price ofprovisions in this country to rise so much higher than the degree of scarcitywould seem to warrant, so much higher than it would do in any other countrywhere this cause did not operate.16[69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_1499]He argued that the transfer of purchasing power into the hands of those whowould otherwise have suffered worst, effected through the Poor Laws, was thereason that prices had risen so steeply: “The principal benefit which they [thePoor Laws] have produced, is exactly that which is most bitterly complained of –the high price of all the necessaries of life. The poor cry out loudly at thisprice; but in so doing, they are very little aware of what they are about; forit has undoubtedly been owing to this price that a much greater number of themhas not been starved.”17 [69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#page_532]Effective demand was boosted by placing additional purchasing power in the handsof those who would otherwise have been reduced to near starvation. Thepopulation at large was obliged to pay a higher price for bread, but the poorestsuffered far less than would have been the case if they had not receivedincreased support. They continued to be able to buy bread and their presence inthe market for bread enhanced the rise in its price. Malthus emphasized that hestill heartily condemned the Poor Law system in general but explicitlyrecognized that “their operation in the present scarcity has been advantageousto the country.”18 [69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_1502]Malthus’s wish to dismantle the Poor Law system sprang, of course, from hisdesire to strengthen the preventive check. Since he devoted so much attention tothe preventive check, it is of interest to note that there is one respect inwhich his description of its operation largely lacks an element that figuresprominently in recent discussions of the same topic. In recent decades work onfamily and household structure has given prominence to the importance of theconvention that no household should normally contain more than one marriedcouple. A man and woman contemplating matrimony were therefore faced with theproblem of ensuring that they had acquired sufficient resources to set up a newhousehold. Elsewhere in the world it was usual for a couple on marriage to joinan existing household.19 [69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_1504] Theexistence of this convention is taken to be central to the explanation both ofthe later average age at marriage in northwest Europe and the frequency withwhich men and women remained single rather than marrying. It was also closelylinked to a feature of household structure and family life that would have beenregarded with surprise and no doubt severe disapproval in much of the rest ofthe world. In seventeenth-century England it was normal both for young men andyoung women living in rural areas to leave the households of their parents intheir teens and spend several years living as servants in the households ofothers. In the archetypal case a young man or woman would be hired at a localhiring fair to work for a year in farm service, during which time the master ofthe household would provide him or her with food, lodging, and a money payment,often given as a lump sum at the end of the year. The young person would thendecide either to attend the annual hiring fair once more and work in anotherhousehold for a further year, or, if he or she had found a prospective partnerand the pair had assembled sufficient resources, instead of embarking on anotheryear of service, would marry. In many parishes there was a marked surge inmarriages in the weeks immediately after the hiring fair.20[69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_1506] Perhaps because comparativedata about household composition and family structures in different countrieswere scanty in the early nineteenth century, Malthus did not draw attention tothis aspect of the functioning of the preventive check though it was stillcommon in rural areas in much of the country in his youth.The extent to which Malthus was handicapped by the limitations of theinformation that was available to him is apparent in other contexts.21[69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_1508] Conscious that when writingthe first Essay he lacked familiarity with much relevant literature, he setabout extending his knowledge with great vigor. In the five years between thepublication of the first and second editions of the Essay he read widely in theexisting literature about population and conducted an extensive correspondence.The first two books in the second edition were largely devoted to describing thebalance between population and productive capacity in countries throughout theworld. The first book dealt with countries in Asia, Africa, the Americas, thePacific islands, and the classical world of Greece and Rome; the second withEuropean countries. They are testimony to the breadth of his reading and containmuch of interest, but they also bring home forcibly the difficulty of obtainingaccurate data either about population or about income and output levels at thebeginning of the nineteenth century. Few countries had begun to take censuses,and vital registration data were even more difficult to secure. The same wastrue of data relating to many aspects of economic performance. This made itdifficult for Malthus to test effectively the validity of some of thepropositions he advanced. Furthermore it made it difficult for him to appreciatethe slow but profound changes in the relationship between economic change andpopulation growth taking place in England during his lifetime, which werereducing the relevance of his “model” of this relationship.22[69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_1510] With the benefit of thestriking increase in information about these two variables during the earlymodern period that has occurred in recent decades, the nature of the difficultyhe was experiencing can be clarified. Once again a figure summarizes the pointat issue.Figure 2 [69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#page_526] plots the annualrate of population growth against changes in the real wage. During the first twocenturies covered, from the mid-sixteenth to the mid-eighteenth century, theirrelationship was classically Malthusian. Productive capacity was rising, ifslowly, and the trend line of the plotted points, stretching northwest tosoutheast, suggests that real wages could be maintained as long as thepopulation was not growing faster than around 0.3–0.4 percent per annum. Inother words, the economy in this period was expanding rapidly enough to make itpossible for population to rise at a modest rate without harm to livingstandards. If growth rates were below this level, real wages rose. If, however,they exceeded this level, and especially if they rose to 0.5 percent per annumand above, real wages plummeted. In the seventy years from 1561 to 1631, thepopulation of England increased from 3.04 million to 4.93 million, an increaseof 62 percent, representing an annual rate of increase of 0.7 percent. Theresult was a sharp fall in real wages. The relationship between populationgrowth rates and real incomes conformed closely to Malthus’s expectations duringthe first two centuries covered in figure 2[69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#page_526]. From the mid-eighteenthcentury onward, however, a new world was slowly coming into existence in whichthe behavior of the two variables ceased to conform to his expectations.Population growth rates skyrocketed, approaching at their peak about 1.4 percentannually. The population rose from 6.31 million in 1761 to 14.94 million in1841, an increase of 137 percent, or an annual growth rate of 1.1 percent.23[69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_1512] Such a rate of growth inearlier centuries would have led to a disastrous fall in living standards, butin the new circumstances that had come to prevail, the real wage held steady andtoward the end of the period even began to edge upward. The consistent negativerelationship between the population growth rate and the real-wage trend, whichhad prevailed for two centuries and probably much longer, faded.24[69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_1514][../img/559_1.png]Figure 2. The points on the graph are ten years apart, and each point representsthe annual rate of change over a third-year period centering on the date shown.Reprinted with permission from E. A. Wrigley, “Coping with Rapid PopulationGrowth: How England Fared in the Century Preceding the Great Exhibition of1851,” in Structures and Transformations in Modern British History, ed. D.Feldman and J. Lawrence (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), 27.Malthus lived in a new age that was coming into being, but its character wasinitially very difficult to discern, and it is not surprising that, in trying tocomprehend what was taking place, contemporaries carried over assumptions froman earlier era. Perhaps the most important single difference between whathappened during the earlier population surge in the Tudor period and events inMalthus’s lifetime is that in Tudor times the growth was relatively uniformthroughout the land. Tudor England was still an essentially rural country andthe bulk of the labor force was engaged in agriculture. As population pressureincreased in rural areas, wages fell and employment became progressively harderto find. Parliament wrestled with the problem of the “sturdy beggars,” men whowere well able to labor but could find no one willing to employ them. Inconformity with the assumptions of the preventive check model, nuptiality fell,causing fertility to decline in sympathy; population growth slowed andeventually halted. By the mid-eighteenth century England had greatly changed.Agriculture employed less than half the male labor force. Indeed, during theperiod of very rapid population growth that ensued, the number employed inagriculture was broadly stationary. Any increase was minor. Malthus’s strictureson improvident marriage decisions would have had clear resonance when Elizabethwas on the throne but were less readily applicable in his own day. Young couplesliving in rural areas who could not find a viable “niche” in the local communitysolved their problem by migration. The growth of industrial and commercialcenters was very rapid. The percentage of the population living in townsincreased sharply. England moved from being one of the least urbanized countriesin Europe in the sixteenth century to occupying pole position by the nineteenthcentury.25 [69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_1516] The nature of thecontrast in growth rates made possible by large-scale internal migration isepitomized, to take an illustrative example, by the contrast between the twocounties of Lancashire and Shropshire during the period 1761–1841. Lancashire’spopulation increased from 324,000 to 1,695,000, or by 423 percent: Shropshire’spopulation rose from 153,000 to 243,000, or by 59 percent.26[69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#page_533] That it was not necessarilyimprudent to continue to marry at an early age despite the speed of populationgrowth is demonstrated by the trend in the real wage during the period ofdramatic population growth.Malthus made the assumption that any significant rise in population mustincrease pressure on the land. In common with the other classical economists hesupposed that this must involve declining returns both to capital and labor aspoorer land was brought into cultivation and existing acreages were worked moreintensively. But the land was the material base for a declining fraction of rawmaterial supply and, crucially, no longer the dominant source of the energyneeds of the population. Even as early as 1700 coal supplied half of the totalenergy consumed in England and Wales. By 1800 coal supplied four-fifths of thetotal.27 [69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_1519] A model of therelationship between population and production that was effective in capturingthe constraints of all organic economies became progressively less relevantsince the land was losing its monopoly in supplying raw materials and energy toproduction processes. A rapidly rising population, rather than being a reasonfor serious alarm, might mark a gradual escape from the constraints that hadpreviously proved insuperable.The nature of the relationship between productive capacity and population waschanging during Malthus’s lifetime in ways that made his model of their linkagesincreasingly inapplicable to the country in which he lived. Nevertheless hisinsistence on the potential benefits associated with the preventive check maywell play a part in explaining the background to the changes that were gatheringmomentum as the eighteenth century progressed. In a famous passage he comparedthe relative speed of the growth of productive capacity and of population to acontest between a tortoise and a hare. But he added that the effect of thepreventive check might be such that the hare was slowed to the point where thetortoise would have no difficulty in matching his speed. Where this was so, animproved standard of living might not only be attained but also preserved.28[69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_1521] Both the evidence ofinventories and the changing occupational structure of England in the earlymodern period strongly suggest that the aggregate structure of demand waschanging substantially. It is not difficult to show that, because the incomeelasticity of demand for goods which the classical economists described as“comforts” and “luxuries” is higher than for basic necessities, a relativelyminor increase in income levels could provide a disproportionate boost to thedemand for goods such as pottery, window glass, clocks, curtains, cookingutensils, furniture, and bedclothes.29[69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_1523] Occupational structurechanged in response to the altered structure of aggregate demand. The operationof the preventive check, by bringing about a somewhat improved level of realincomes and helping to preserve any gains made, may account in part for thechanges that occurred.It is a striking and impressive feature of Malthus’s research and writing thathe was both eager to secure new knowledge and willing to modify his views as aresult. This aspect of his work endeared him to John Maynard Keynes. He admiredMalthus for his discussion of the possibility of a general glut and hisreasoning in doubting Say’s law, but still more for his openness of mind and hiswillingness to give greater prominence to what Malthus termed “experience,” thatis empirical evidence, than to theorizing. Keynes expressed forcibly his regretthat as a discipline economics had followed the path trodden by Ricardo ratherthan that which Malthus took.30[69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_1525] In deploring the “precipitateattempt to simplify and generalize” in much writing about economic affairs,Malthus himself had written, “The same tendency to simplify and generalize,produces a still greater disinclination to allow of modifications, limitationsand exceptions to any rule or proposition, than to admit the operation of morecauses than one . . . yet there is no truth of which I feel a strongerconviction than that there are many important propositions in political economywhich absolutely require limitations and exceptions.”31[69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_1527]It is worth stressing in conclusion that despite the apparent harshness of hisviews about support for the least fortunate members of society implied by thewish to abolish the Poor Law system, Malthus was strongly sympathetic to theirsufferings and advocated a variety of reforms that would help them, notably theestablishment of a universal system of school education. Ignorance and povertywere, in his view, closely intertwined (although he did not use the term, he hada good understanding of what would nowadays be called feedback mechanisms). Hewas an ardent advocate of the value of promoting savings banks. Their presencewould help to inculcate the habit of prudent calculation, a habit of mind thatmust strengthen the preventive check.32[69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_1529]His concern for the sufferings of the poor was prominent even when he wroteabout aspects of the economic and political life of the country that mightappear far removed from this issue. For example, he was a firm advocate of theimportance of what he termed the “principle of private property,” and in thatconnection put forward an argument about one aspect of its functioning whichsuggested that, rather like the preventive check, its presence must tend tobenefit the living standards of the laboring poor: “With a view to theindividual interest, either of a landlord or farmer, no labourer can ever beemployed on the soil, who does not produce more than the value of his wages; andif these wages be not on an average sufficient to maintain a wife, and rear twochildren to the age of marriage, it is evident that both population and producemust come to a stand.”33 [69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_1531] Inother words, a capitalist organization of economic life would promote arelatively favorable balance between population and resources by creating aninstitutional framework in which the minimum real wage would be adequate tosupport a family. This line of reasoning is reminiscent of the distinction drawnby development economists between a peasant economy in which family members maybe retained on the farm until the average output of each family member isreduced to mere subsistence, and a market economy in which members will begin toleave the farmstead when the marginal member produces only what he or sheconsumes.34 [69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_1533] Private propertyin Malthus’s view was one aspect of a more general desideratum, civil liberty:Of all the causes which tend to generate prudential habits among the lowerclasses of society, the most essential is unquestionably civil liberty. Nopeople can be much accustomed to form plans for the future, who do not feelassured that their industrious exertions, while fair and honourable, will beallowed to have free scope; and that the property which they either possess, ormay acquire, will be secured to them by a known code of just laws impartiallyadministered.35 [69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_1535]Elsewhere, as if anxious to dispel any doubt about his motives in calling for anend to the Poor Law system, Malthus wrote as follows:With regard to the large sum which is collected from the higher classes ofsociety for the support of the poor, I can safely say, that in the discussion ofthe question it has always been with me a most subordinate consideration[.]I should indeed think that the whole, or a much greater sum, was well applied,if it merely relieved the comparatively few that would be in want, if there wereno public provision for them, with the fatal and unavoidable consequence ofincreasing their number, and depressing the condition of those who werestruggling to maintain themselves in independence. Were it possible to fix thenumber of the poor and to avoid the further depression of the independentlabourer, I should be the first to propose that those who were actually in wantshould be most liberally relieved, and that they should receive it as a right,and not as a bounty.36 [69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_1468]Notes1 [69_The_Preventive_Check_and_the_Poo.html#id_1470].

He was himself well awareof this problem.

Concerning Malthus’scorrespondence with Ricardo, Keynes remarked, “One cannot rise from a perusal ofthis correspondence without a feeling that the almost total obliteration ofMalthus’s line of approach and the complete domination of Ricardo’s for a periodof a hundred years has been a disaster to the progress of economics. Time aftertime in these letters Malthus is talking plain sense, the force of which Ricardowith his head in the clouds wholly fails to comprehend. Time after time acrushing refutation by Malthus is met by a mind so completely closed thatRicardo does not even see what Malthus is saying.” Keynes, Essays in Biography(London, 1933), 140–141. Keynes himself is alleged, on an occasion when he hadbeen accused of inconsistency, to have replied, “When the facts change, I changemy mind.

As he wrote in the Origin of Species: “Evenslow-breeding man has doubled in twenty-five years, and at this rate, in lessthan a thousand years, there would literally not be standing room for hisprogeny.” 2 [70_Malthusian_Economics__Right_or_W.html#id_1464] Friedrich Engelsis more typical in denouncing the Malthusian doctrine as a vile and repulsiveblasphemy against man and nature3[70_Malthusian_Economics__Right_or_W.html#id_1462] (although Bertrand Russellargued that Karl Marx’s labor theory of value was nevertheless derived bysurreptitiously accepting Malthus’s doctrine of population).4[70_Malthusian_Economics__Right_or_W.html#id_1460] William Hazlitt similarlyattributed Malthus’s gloomy predictions to some personal defect: “Unless MrMalthus can contrive to starve someone, he thinks that he does nothing.”5[70_Malthusian_Economics__Right_or_W.html#id_1458]Modern writers tend to dismiss Malthus in less emotional terms, observing thathe was unaware of the technical advances of the Industrial Revolution that werejust around the corner in his time and continue to be made today.6[70_Malthusian_Economics__Right_or_W.html#id_1456] Sometimes it is not onlyargued that the rate of food production can and will be stepped up enormously,but that increasing wealth is bound to lead to a natural decrease in thebirthrate.7 [70_Malthusian_Economics__Right_or_W.html#id_1454]My impression is that both the critics who criticize Malthus for being evil andthose who criticize him for being ignorant or out of date are more interested inmaking rhetorical points than in responding to what he actually wrote. Forexample, it is commonplace to ignore the fact that the second edition of hisEssay admits the possibility (discounted in the first edition) that birthcontrol may eventually solve the problem.8[70_Malthusian_Economics__Right_or_W.html#page_545] This chapter therefore looksagain at the Malthusian doctrine with a view to demonstrating that a suitablycleaned-up version is essentially tautological.So much has been written on this subject that it is hard to say anything thathas not been said many times before, but perhaps I can contribute by saying whatis necessary without excluding readers who have no mathematical background. Isit really true that as Malthus suggests a population will necessarily increaseexponentially (geometrically) if the birth- and death-rates are fixed so thatthe former exceeds the latter?9[70_Malthusian_Economics__Right_or_W.html#id_1451] What does it mean to say thatsomething increases exponentially? Journalists seem to think that “exponential”means very big, but mathematicians mean something much more precise by the term.What of Malthus on food production? Is it really true that this can onlyincrease linearly (arithmetically)? What does it mean that something increaseslinearly? Must something that increases exponentially necessarily outgrowsomething that increases linearly? What if Malthus’s claim that food productioncan only increase linearly is mistaken? Does his claim that a human populationwill then necessarily outgrow its food supply consequently fail? If not, howlong will it take?Only the last of these questions is difficult if one can succeed in puttingaside the religious and emotional issues that arise when scenarios of doom orbirth control are on the table.Exponential GrowthAt the root of Malthus’s argument is the incontestable proposition thatsomething cannot grow without bound if there is a bound that it cannot exceed.When he argues that the birth- and death-rate of a human population cannot stayfixed if the former exceeds the latter, he therefore does not need to appeal tothe fact that the population would then increase exponentially. If there werealways just one more person alive on the earth every year than the year before,then there would eventually be nowhere left to stand.10[70_Malthusian_Economics__Right_or_W.html#id_1449]Malthus insisted that the population will increase exponentially (orgeometrically) under his assumptions because he wanted to emphasize that thecatastrophe he anticipated was not located in some far-distant future but wasawaiting just around the corner. Events have shown that he was wrong to thinkthat the catastrophe was as close as he thought at the time he wrote, but itdoes not follow that modern prophets of doom are wrong when they repeat hiswarnings after doing their best to take account of all the factors that he wasin no position to evaluatePUT NOT THY TRUST IN PRINCESSomething grows exponentially if there is a time period in which it doubles insize. For example, Benjamin Franklin (who was propounding the Malthusiandoctrine long before Malthus) estimated that the population of the Americancolonies would double every 25 years – which turned out to be more or lesscorrect for the next 150 years.11[70_Malthusian_Economics__Right_or_W.html#id_1447] On the assumption that futureresource constraints in the whole world could similarly be neglected today,Franklin would be led to a doubling-up period of about 54 years.12[70_Malthusian_Economics__Right_or_W.html#id_1445]Everybody has their favorite way of illustrating how fast exponential growth canbe once it takes off. The story of a water lily that doubles its size every dayis a popular conundrum for children. If it takes thirty-one days to cover half apond, how many more days before it covers the whole pond? Charles Darwinpreferred elephants to water lilies. He calculated that a single pair ofelephants would have at least 19 million live progeny after 750 years ifunhindered by resource constraints.My own favorite is the story of an Indian potentate who offered the inventor ofchess whatever reward he chose. The inventor proposed that he should be givenone grain of rice on the first square of his chessboard and an amount on eachsubsequent square equal to double the amount on the previous square. The numberof grains of rice on the final square would then mass more than one of thelarger asteroids!13 [70_Malthusian_Economics__Right_or_W.html#id_1443] Thelesson that Malthus would draw is that, somewhere along the line, theimpossibility of granting the inventor his chosen reward would necessarilybecome apparent. In the event, so the story goes, the inventor lost his headwhen the potentate broke his promise after finally realizing how he had beentaken for a fool.Sometimes critics seeking to discredit Malthus deny that there is a fixed boundto the resources available for feeding the world’s population. It is airily saidthat technology will come to the rescue as it has is in the past. However, themass of the earth is an ultimate bound that no new technology seems likely toovercome. I have heard it argued to the contrary that there are other planetsout in space for us to colonize. But even if we could pack the world populationinto a squirming mass of humanity contained in a cube whose surface receded fromthe earth at the speed of light, there would still eventually not be room for apopulation that expands exponentially. The reason is that exponential growth isnot only faster than linear growth as Malthus argued; it will eventuallyovertake anything that grows like the volume of a cube.14[70_Malthusian_Economics__Right_or_W.html#id_1441]Unless modern physics is hopelessly wrong about what is or is not physicallyimpossible, it follows that Malthus’s basic claim is unimpeachable. A populationcannot increase forever with a fixed birthrate that exceeds its death-rate – nomatter what technological advances may be made in the future. Something willtherefore happen to change either the birth- or death-rate. We can do thisourselves – as the Chinese have done in their own country – or we can await thearrival of the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.CHANGING BIRTH- AND DEATH-RATES?It is sometimes not appreciated that Malthus was making a hypothetical argumentwhen discussing exponential growth. Critics point to various populations thathave not in fact increased exponentially and seem to feel that this is enough todispose of the Malthusian doctrine. But such critics miss the point that Malthusargues that the birth- and death-rates must necessarily adjust to lower the rateat which a population grows because people who cannot feed themselves cannotreproduce themselves. For example, at the time that Malthus wrote, thepopulation of Great Britain was clearly not expanding exponentially like that ofthe United States. To see why not, it is enough to note that John Stuart Millwas converted to the need for birth control when he came across dead childrenabandoned in a London street.15[70_Malthusian_Economics__Right_or_W.html#id_1439]How can the birthrate be decreased without resorting to infanticide or equallyrepugnant measures? One method is for us all to follow the Chinese example byrestricting the number of children a woman can have by government decree.Methods of enforcement less brutal than those sometimes reported from Chinacould doubtless be found, but any kind of enforcement is bound to be unpleasantat best. However, this would need to be a global enterprise. Exponential growthis so relentless that the Chinese experiment in self-control, even if continuedforever, would only reduce the long-run doubling-up period of the total worldpopulation by a negligible factor. China might perhaps be able to secure itsboundaries against the war, famine, and disease that would inevitably afflictthe rest of the world in this scenario, but it seems much more likely that itwould only succeed in briefly delaying a similar fate.Another unpleasant expedient would be to reduce the ratio of the death-rate tothe birthrate by asking or requiring old folks to surrender their lives as newbabies are born. It is said that elderly people on the island of Cos inclassical times chose to drink hemlock because it was considered impolite tolive too long, so perhaps something similar might eventually come to seemacceptable in our own culture. I certainly hope that I will have the courage totake my own life before I become a burden to myself and others, but who islikely to volunteer departing this life before they have become a burden?A more popular expedient than birth control by government decree consists ofdoing nothing, on the grounds that increasing prosperity will spread throughoutthe world, with the result that people will choose to have fewer children. It istrue that there is empirical support for the proposition that more prosperoussocieties nowadays have lower birthrates. It is also true that prosperity is alot more widespread nowadays than in the past. But where is the evidence thatthese effects are strong enough to make any significant difference in the longrun? Only the most naive Pollyanna would be willing to predict an inevitablecontinuation of the spread of prosperity at a time when our global resources arecoming under increasing strain and the consequences of global warming arewaiting in the wings.It is evident that I am pessimistic about the future. The probability thatevents will sort themselves out without our active intervention seems negligibleto me. Perhaps the human race will get its act together in time to take therepugnant steps necessary to get our birth- and death-rates under control, butthis also seems unlikely. The mere fact that the essence of the Malthusiandoctrine should be denied so vociferously by so many is just one of manyproblems standing in the way. I weep for the woes my great-grandchildren arelikely to suffer, but nothing that people like me write in articles like this isgoing to make any difference. The question is not whether disaster is on thehorizon but how long we have to wait before it strikes us down.To answer this question, we need to make predictions about how long the world’sfood supply can keep up with population growth. It is here that Malthus wentwrong in arguing that we cannot achieve more than linear (arithmetic) growth infood production.ProductionHow long we have to wait for the coming population catastrophe depends on howfast we can increase our productivity. I am not one of the doom-sayers who thinkthat we are already close to our productivity frontier, but nor am I one of thenumerous commentators who think that we can count on technological advances tokick the problem into the long grass for our remote ancestors to solve. SuchPollyannas were doubtless predicting a utopian future for Easter Island justbefore its final collapse. The truth is that nobody – neither optimists norpessimists – can predict scientific breakthroughs in advance. So all I can do inthis section is provide some background in how economists think about productionfunctions to provide a framework within which different scenarios can beevaluated.ARITHMETIC INCREASE?Malthus proposed treating food production as though it grows linearly(arithmetically).16 [70_Malthusian_Economics__Right_or_W.html#id_1437] Thisamounts to assuming that annual food production increases by a fixed amount inevery period. The fixed increment he proposed as being larger than anythingactually possible was the current annual food production over a period oftwenty-five years. Applying this reasoning to Britain in 1798, Malthus arguedthat there would be 77 million people after only a century who could not befed.17 [70_Malthusian_Economics__Right_or_W.html#id_1435]I suspect that Malthus chose to assume that the food supply can only growlinearly largely for rhetorical reasons. He could simply have said that foodproduction is bounded (by the mass of the earth or one of many much smallerinescapable bounds), but then his readers would have consigned his warnings tothe infinite future. He therefore chose to compare exponential growth in apopulation with linear growth in food production so that his audience wouldtreat his warnings as relevant to their great-grandchildren.Why did Malthus choose to assume that growth in food production would be no morethan linear? I suspect for no better reason than that he could then appeal tothe mathematical commonplace that exponential growth is much faster than lineargrowth without boring his readers with any tiresome algebra.I have heard Malthus’s assumption that the growth in food production can be nomore than linear defended on the grounds that he was merely taking the law ofdiminishing returns for granted, but this defense misses the point that Malthusassumed food production to be linear with respect to time rather than moredirectly relevant inputs such as capital, labor, or land. But there seems littlepoint in pursuing his reasoning in this matter, since events have nowconclusively refuted his linearity assumption.DIMINISHING RETURNSA particularly naive version of the labor theory of value – too naive even forKarl Marx – makes labor the only relevant input in production.18[70_Malthusian_Economics__Right_or_W.html#id_1433] If so, we would never need toworry about feeding the multitudes engendered by exponential growth, because theproduction of food would then increase linearly with the size of the population,and therefore exponentially with respect to time (rather than linearly, as inthe story that Malthus offers). Perhaps this is what happened in BenjaminFranklin’s America during the 150 years for which his prediction about itspopulation growth turned out to be valid (inputs other than labor, notablycapital and land, being relatively unimportant in the circumstances of thetime).However, the law of diminishing returns applies to labor as to any other factorof production. If all other factors of production are held constant, the lawsays that the extra output obtained by employing an extra worker will eventuallystart decreasing. For example, adding more workers to a job like growingtomatoes in a greenhouse will eventually result in their getting in each other’sway.RETURNS TO SCALEThe naive labor theory of value considered above makes labor the only relevantinput to a production function with constant returns to scale. Economists saythat constant returns to scale applies when scaling up all the inputs to aproduction process results in the output being scaled up by the same factor.There is a sense in which all production processes using a fixed technologynecessarily have constant returns to scale, provided that all the inputs to theprocess have been listed. One then simply needs to duplicate whatever one did tomake the last unit of output when making the next unit. When talking aboutincreasing or decreasing returns to scale, economists are therefore taking forgranted either a change in technology or else recognizing that some inputs havenot been taken into account. For example, it would be easy to overlook the factthat oxygen is needed to smelt iron ore, since nobody (yet) needs to pay for theair we breathe. But nobody would neglect the need for oxygen if smelting ironore on the moon.Increasing returns to scale traditionally arise when operating at a larger scaleallows something to be made more efficiently. Adam Smith famously used themanufacture of pins to illustrate this point.19[70_Malthusian_Economics__Right_or_W.html#id_1431] With many workers, the laborof making a pin can be divided, so that each worker can specialize in just oneof the necessary operations – such as cutting the wire into suitable lengths orsharpening one end of such a length into a point. Ten workers who specialize inthis way produce many more than ten times the number of pins that a singleworker who has to do all the operations alone could produce. However, the law ofdiminishing returns tells us that such efficiency gains must eventually taperoff, unless all the other inputs (like factory space) are increased inproportion to the increases in labor.A standard production function is therefore shaped like a forward-sloping letterS. It begins by showing increasing returns to scale, but eventually switches todecreasing returns to scale as shortages of inputs originally deemed to beavailable in infinite abundance begin to bite. In both phases, new technologies– ways of doing things – need to be continually brought online. At first, newways of doing things are necessary to exploit the efficiency gains thatoperating on a larger scale make possible in the increasing-returns phase. Buteven in the decreasing-returns phase, the technology in use will need to adaptas the increasing scarcity of some inputs forces up their prices and so providesan incentive to use them less intensively. Of course, eventually the price ofany resource will rise through the roof as it begins to run out.20[70_Malthusian_Economics__Right_or_W.html#id_1429] All production functions aretherefore necessarily bounded. No matter what technology may be employed, thereis an absolute maximum on the output of all physical processes.MAGIC PORRIDGE POTS?Some critics react to the preceding discussion of production functions withdisdain. It is said that such pieces of neoclassical economics have beenrendered hopelessly out of date by the accelerating rate of scientific andtechnological advance in modern times.21[70_Malthusian_Economics__Right_or_W.html#id_1427] It cannot be deniedtechnological advances definitively refute Malthus’s claim that linear growth infood production is the best that we can hope for. But although Malthus antedatedthe Industrial Revolution, the same is not true of neoclassical economics. Itscommonsense precepts on the nature of production remain valid whatevertechnology may be applied.Critics respond by drawing attention to all the many ways that food productionhas been increased since Malthus’s time. We are reminded of rail transport andtractors, electricity and computers, fertilizers and the green revolution. Theseand all the other advances that have been made since 1798 certainly have delayedthe disaster that Malthus predicted would happen if birth- and death-rates arenot somehow brought under control, but they have not altered the fact thatproduction functions are necessarily S-shaped and bounded above. All that haschanged is the shape of the S and the height of the bound.Can science be relied on to rescue us when the demand for food gets close to thecurrent upper bound on production? Or to put the same point more tendentiously,is science a magic porridge pot that can produce porridge from nowhere as in thefairy story that so delighted my children when they were small? We have alreadyseen why the answer is no. Modern physics constrains what is possible. Forexample, nothing can exceed the speed of light. Mass and energy areinterchangeable, but the total cannot be created or destroyed. It is thereforepossible to imagine an ideal production function that already incorporates allfuture technological advances. This ideal production function will necessarilybe S-shaped and bounded above like its less-perfect brethren. Applying Malthus’sargument to this ideally scientific production function will yield the longestperiod that we can hope to feed a population whose birthrate is fixed higherthan its death-rate. Nothing says that output produced according to such anideal production function may not initially match an exponentially growingpopulation, but the law of diminishing returns will inexorably step in as soonas some vital resource begins to be exhausted.To deny this conclusion is essentially to put one’s faith in some supernaturalresolution of the population problem. But I for one think it as unlikely thatour progeny will be fed by manna from heaven as that modern physics will berefuted by the discovery of a magic porridge pot.UncertaintyThe question left unanswered by the previous section is how long it would bebefore a population growing exponentially would exceed a food supply generatedby an ideally scientific production process. One can always find gurus who claimto know the answers to such questions, but why should we imagine that they knowany better than Malthus? The case of scientific advances is particularlytelling. The memory of the astronomer royal in my own country who denied thepossibility of space travel a few days before the Russians put the first Sputnikinto orbit is especially sweet.Uncertainties about future technology are just one of numerous other sources ofuncertainty. What impact is global warming going to have on agriculture? Has thesupply of fossil fuels peaked? What of future social and political developments?Who would have guessed a few decades ago that the Soviet Union would be replacedas our leading enemy by Al-Qaeda? Is it possible that wars can be avoided assquabbling over dwindling resources become more intense? What of the massmovement of refugees fleeing across borders in the hope of finding food andwater? How can epidemics be avoided when undernourished people live huddledtogether in unsanitary conditions?All I can say on this subject is that there is no point in looking to economistsfor adequate ways of modeling such uncertainties. The recent credit crunch oughtto be enough to discredit the current Bayesian orthodoxy in which economicagents are assumed to be able to assign determinate probabilities to allrelevant future events.22 [70_Malthusian_Economics__Right_or_W.html#id_1425]However, it is generally acknowledged that the current methodology fails to givesufficient weight to the possibility of “low probability” events which wouldhave a large impact if they were to occur. For example, the Stern Report onglobal warming was explicitly motivated by the need to better incorporate suchpossibilities into a utilitarian evaluation of what climate change may entailfor the human race.23 [70_Malthusian_Economics__Right_or_W.html#id_1423] Evenfinancial economists recognize the need to replace their normal (bell curve)probability distributions by new distributions with “fat tails.” These aremovements in the right direction but hopelessly inadequate in my opinion.24[70_Malthusian_Economics__Right_or_W.html#id_1421]One may hope that the scientific advances we need to improve food productionwill also include advances in how we model uncertainties. Such advances wouldallow us to incorporate in our models not just the aversion to risk that is astaple of orthodox Bayesian decision theory but also the aversion to ambiguitythat behavioral economists report arises when laboratory subjects are faced withsituations in which there is uncertainty about what probability (if any) toassign to future events – such as whether physicists will finally come up with asource of cheap energy or an antigravity machine. However, current attempts tomodel ambiguity aversion are not very reassuring, since they commonly assumethat people will proceed as though the worst-case scenario is going to happen.Applying this principle to Malthus’s argument generates a prospect so gloomythat it is not surprising that nobody is willing to examine it too closely.ConclusionThis essay puts the case for treating the essence of Malthus’s argument asessentially tautological: something cannot grow without bound if there is abound that it cannot exceed. The fact that a population with a birthrate fixedhigher than its death-rate necessarily grows exponentially is a flourish whichimplies that the bound can be reached very fast unless the birth- anddeath-rates adjust to the depletion of resources soon enough. Malthus was wrongto argue that the increase of the food supply can only grow linearly with time,but he does not need this assumption for his argument to work.How long it would it take for disaster to strike on the Malthusian hypothesisthat birth- and death-rates remain unchanged? All I have to say on this subjectis that economics offers no comfort. Various gurus to the contrary, the answerdepends on which of many uncertain events, each of which is individually veryunlikely, are realized in the future. We do not even know how to model suchuncertainties in an adequate way.Even the implicit assumption in the previous sentence that the existence of aneconomic model that adequately captured the realities of our predicament wouldresult in the human race responding in a collectively rational manner seemsunreasonably optimistic in a world in which fanatics of various stripes arevirulently opposed to any kind of abortion or the genetic modification of crops.I am sorry not to be able to end on a more positive note, but I think that – aswith global warming – the efforts that governments eventually make to deal withpopulation growth will be too little and too late. Our great-grandchildren looklikely to pay a terrible price for the folly of their ancestors.NOTESI am grateful for financial support from the European Research Council under theEuropean Community’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007–2013)/ERC grant295449.1 [70_Malthusian_Economics__Right_or_W.html#id_1465].

Critics who delight inhow badly wrong Malthus was in this calculation fail to notice that it ishypothetical in character–valid only if the population were to keep doubling upevery twenty-five years. But the essence of his argument is that the economicsof diminishing food resources would necessarily alter the birth- and death-rateslong before there were millions of people with nothing to eat. However, the factthat he is criticized for wrong reasons on this count does not make hisassumptions about the food supply any better.18 [70_Malthusian_Economics__Right_or_W.html#id_1432]. The economist DavidRicardo–Malthus’s old friend and intellectual sparring partner–offered a lessthreadbare version of the labor theory of value.

At themargin will be land that generates only enough income to pay off the labornecessary to cultivate it. The value of the food produced on such marginal landis then equal to the value of the labor needed to produce it–provided all theissues that are abstracted away in such an analysis are indeed negligible.19 [70_Malthusian_Economics__Right_or_W.html#id_1430].

Binmore, RationalDecisions."},{"pageContent":"The Cultural and Literary Significance of the 1803 EssayKAREN O’BRIENThe cultural and literary impact of Malthus’s 1803 edition of the Essay was bothconsiderable in itself and deeply enmeshed with contemporary circumstances inthe first few decades after its publication: circumstances that included theNapoleonic wars, political controversy about poverty and food scarcity, culturaldebates about the rate and age of marriage, and, more specifically, thesignificance of the findings of first British censuses of 1801, 1811, and 1821.Malthus’s work and his very name (the adjective “Malthusian” was first used inthe 1820s) became so entangled with issues of population measurement and poorrelief that questions of impact and influence require careful and sequentialreconstruction. Donald Winch and Philip Connell, for example, have shown how“Malthusianism” was the quickly established and patiently elaborated artifact ofMalthus’s Romantic and Tory critics.1[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1419] Since then, the Malthus whommost of us have come to know is, to a large extent, the counter-creation of hisenemies: a figure who appears to be more secular, more narrow and retrograde inhis social thinking than the intellectually flexible, politically WhiggishChristian minister who published the 1803 Essay.The Malthus of the 1803 Essay was more broadly influential than his Romanticcritics allowed, not only among his fellow political economists but on pressingdebates in the early nineteenth century. These debates concerned the nationalimportance of marriage, the status of women, the social impact of overseasemigration, the social efficacy of enlightened self-interest, the relationshipbetween a Christian ethics of personal responsibility and the national economy,and the meaning of history itself. In all of these discussions during the firstthree decades of the nineteenth century, and in the many places in which thesedebates took place – reviews, pamphlets, dissertations, novels, poems, anddidactic tales – Malthus’s Essay was a constant, shaping presence. Broad thoughthese debates were, the Essay intervened in them with two haunting questions:What if it is really true that we are now living at the limit of our naturalsustainability? And what are the moral consequences of either accepting oracting upon such a supposition? For imaginative writers in particular, there wasa third question: how might it feel to be, in the modern, demographic sense, aredundant human being?Reviewers of the 1803 Essay – an imposing quarto that appeared under Malthus’sown name – were in agreement that it was quite different in meaning andsignificance from the 1798 edition. They saw the earlier version as a bravurapolemic against Utopian radical philosophers such as William Godwin and theMarquis de Condorcet but viewed this new book as a serious and historicallygrounded economic analysis of the population problem. Although the 1803 Essaywas not initially covered by the Edinburgh Review, it received lengthy andbroadly favorable treatment in a number of other major publications, includingthe Monthly Review, Gentleman’s Magazine, and British Critic. These allinterested themselves greatly in what Malthus had to say about the “preventive”check of delayed marriage and how, at different eras and places, climate,culture, and political institutions create differing male attitudes towardwomen, marriage age, and family size.2[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1417] The irony of a Christianminister urging readers not to go forth and multiply in too great a hurry wasnot lost on any of the reviewers. However, two reviews by major figures appearedin 1804, one by the statistician and agricultural writer Arthur Young and one bythe poet Robert Southey. These fired the opening salvos in the long campaignagainst Malthus’s timeserving justification of apathy and harshness toward thepoor, and particularly Malthus’s advocacy of the gradual withdrawal of poorrelief, on the basis of his needlessly pessimistic extrapolations from the factof population growth. That the population was growing, and that this had beendemonstrated incontrovertibly by the findings of the 1801 census, all wereagreed. But not, Southey insisted, to the point where there was at that momentso great a pressure of population on basic resources as to necessitate drasticreductions in poor relief: “If a country be over-peopled, and crowded, anddistressed, in regard to its system of society, before it be half peopled inproportion to its size and power of production; the fault lies in the system ofsociety, not in the system of nature. If, while not a tenth, nay not anhundredth part of the habitable world be cultivated, mankind be every where inwant, the fault is their own.”3[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1415]Measuring the FutureSouthey’s self-confidence as a reviewer was underpinned by his friendship withthe architect of the first British census, the statistician and civil servantJohn Rickman (as well as, for this particular review, direct help from SamuelColeridge).4 [71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1413] Rickman wouldlater provide Southey with extensive assistance in honing further attacks onMalthus in the periodicals, notably Southey’s landmark essay “On the State ofthe Poor, the Principle of Mr. Malthus’s Essay on Population, and theManufacturing System” for the Quarterly Review of December 1812. Rickman securedTory political backing for the census at a time of acute national concern aboutfood security and the size of the male fighting force: “No country canconfidently pretend to provide the requisite quantity of food, till they knowthe number of consumers,” he wrote.5[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1411] He then personally oversawthe first four censuses of 1801, 1811, 1821, and 1831 (and the British censuscontinues at decennial intervals to this day).6[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1409] Rickman was among those moretraditional pro-populationist thinkers, who associated larger numbers of peoplewith national strength, and who believed that the census would reveal a largeand increasing population. The first census pro-formas, filled out by localoverseers of the poor, ascertained the numbers of residents, subdivided by sexand occupation (or lack of occupation, if on poor relief).7[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1407] Separating those employed inagriculture from those engaged in “trade, manufactures, or handicraft,” theygave some indication of national productivity. Including those not at home atthe time (military and naval personnel, and convicts), the census revealed apopulation of 9.4 million in England and Wales. This figure did not entirelysurprise Rickman or Malthus, but what did strike Malthus in particular was that,although in the mid-eighteenth century, “as far as can be collected from thebirths and marriages, the population was increasing but slowly,” there had beena dramatic and accelerating takeoff in population from this point.8[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1405] Malthus was able to commenton this rate of increase because a second strand of the 1801 census exerciserequired local clergymen to trawl through their parish registers and recordnumbers of baptisms and burials at ten-year intervals from 1700, along withannual numbers of marriages from 1754 (the date from which all marriages had totake place by formal ceremony). There is every likelihood, for example, thatJane Austen, a clergyman’s daughter living in Steventon in Hampshire, helpedwith this process; she must certainly have known about it. Austen was at home on10 March 1801 on the day of the enumeration; since she regularly acted as herfather’s parish clerk by making entries in the parish registers of his twolivings, she may well have helped him to perform this arduous task.9[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1403]The data furnished by the census provided an imperfect yet transformativeaccount of the state of the nation. When compounded by the finding of the 1811census that the population of England and Wales had increased by over 1 millionin only ten years, Britain found itself coming to terms, for good or ill, withan entirely new vision of its own history. Earlier models of the recent past, interms of incremental progress or cyclical development and decline, weresupplanted by the visual model of a fairly flat line followed by a sudden upwardcurve. Added to this was the discovery, after the 1821 census first measured theage of the population in five- and ten-year age groups, that Britain was aspectacularly young country, with almost half the population under twenty yearsold. Reinhart Koselleck in Futures Past, his study of the conceptualization oftime and history in Western culture, associates the period from the lateeighteenth to the mid-nineteenth centuries with a crisis in historicalconsciousness whereby “the temporal dimension within which experience hadpreviously been developed and collected became displaced.”10[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#page_564] An emerging new sense ofhistorical time, Koselleck argues, was underpinned by a “law of acceleration. . . on the basis of which standards were continually altered, since theacceleration of the future constantly foreshortened resort to the past.Population increased in ever-decreasing intervals; technically – createdvelocities rose exponentially; the increase of production showed similartendencies.”11 [71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1400]To what extent did the census in Britain contribute to a collective sense oftemporal acceleration? Kathrin Levitan in her study A Cultural History of theBritish Census has endeavored to gauge the cultural impact of theseextraordinary discoveries as they filtered through and were filtered by the workof Malthus.12 [71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1398] She documentsthe ambivalence about such explosive growth, and the way in which census datacrystallized anxieties about urbanization and urban mortality rates, as well asabout the balance between the agricultural and manufacturing sectors of theeconomy. Malthus’s 1803 Essay was not the first or only work to confront theseissues, but its impact was distinctive, Levitan argues, in terms of the way itpositioned population surplus and redundancy not as an adventitious but as astructural feature of economic history: “The political and intellectual life ofMalthus’s concept of surplus population can be traced through the first half ofthe nineteenth century through the perspective of the census. The census . . .helped make surplus a national concept that was understood in terms ofproportions of people and national productivity.”13[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1396] This Malthusian perspectiveshone a spotlight on unproductive or surplus individuals, and transposed olderdiscussions of poverty, spinsterhood, bachelorhood, and marriage, and also ofemigration overseas into a new, nationally consequential economic idiom. Itallowed others to assess the extent of poverty notably Patrick Colquhoun, who inhis Treatise of Indigence (1806) used both census returns and the nationalsurvey of paupers (1802–1803) to reveal in England and Wales over a millionpaupers, nearly a quarter of a million in an underclass of vagrants,prostitutes, and “gypsies,” and over 1.5 million agricultural male and femalelaborers.14 [71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1394]Alternative Pasts and FuturesUltimately, the combined question posed by Malthus and the census was about theextent to which the British past offered any guidance as to the future. As wellas seeking to model mathematically rates of population increase in ways thatwould enable states to anticipate disaster, Malthus, as Murray Milgate andShannon C. Stimson have argued, thought that the “capacity to calculate distantconsequences and form reliable plans for the future is a fundamental part of theformation of moral character, or prudence.”15[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1392] Political economy –understood as an integrated science of politics, economics, and morals – was forMalthus as for Adam Smith a means of guiding both individuals and legislatorsthrough the dilemmas of an expanding commercial and manufacturing society.Although Malthus was far less optimistic than Smith about the possibilities ofcontinuing economic growth and increased productivity enabled by the division oflabor, contemporary reviewers immediately recognized the close affinity betweenthese two writers. For Malthus, as for Smith, the purpose of political economywas to inform individual and state actors about how to promote “the gradual andprogressive improvement in human society” (as opposed to the Utopian schemes fortransformation favored by Godwin and Condorcet).16[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1390] Recent accounts of Malthus’sthought have explained his allegiance to an Anglican version of the British WhigEnlightenment of Smith, David Hume, and Edward Gibbon.17[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1388] As the final chapter of the1803 Essay makes clear, the domain of human history is one we can shape by acombination of individual responsibility, legislative intervention (creating anational system of education, for example), and also nonintervention (as a wayto solve the problem of welfare dependency). Yet at the same time that Malthusoffered a heavily modified version of Smith’s vision of the future of humanhistory, with population setting an absolute limit to progress and prosperity,he also showed, in the first two books of the 1803 Essay, the narrow classspecificity of such notions of progress: “The histories of mankind which wepossess,” Malthus brilliantly observed, “are, in general, histories only of thehigher classes.”18 [71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1386]Enlightenment thinkers had posited a model of economic and social developmentthrough a series of four stages, in which pastoral and agricultural societieswere positioned as historically prior to commercial modernity. The reality,Malthus insisted, is that most people have always inhabited a separate historyof “oscillation” between the “retrograde and progressive movements” associatedwith living close to the margins of subsistence and being subject tovicissitudes of scarcity, disease, and conflict.19[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1384] The hidden, disconnectedsubhistory of the poorer part of mankind that Malthus depicted in the earlyparts of the Essay underscores humanity’s biological participation in thenatural world; its participants have no historical consciousness, no insightinto what he called the “internal structure of human society,” which is visibleonly to those with access to statistical and economic forms of analysis.20[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1382]The Hidden History of PovertyThe significance of the cognitive deficit that Malthus ascribed to those membersof society most likely to be affected by positive population checks was not loston early critics of the Essay. William Wordsworth repeatedly challengeddistinctions between public lives and poor lives, between those whose relativeeconomic insulation from natural “oscillation” gives them a privileged positionof observation and the poor who simply live within the subhistorical domain. Inmany of his early poems, Wordsworth describes encounters between well-meaningbut baffled middle-class figures and poor, vulnerable, usually itinerantcharacters. In his Lyrical Ballads of 1798, for example, in the poem “We areSeven,” a man encounters an eight-year-old “cottage girl” from a family of sevenchildren who insists repeatedly that, although two of her siblings have died,“we are seven.” Wordsworth juxtaposes the speaker’s simplistic logic of countingagainst the girl’s tenacious sense of who counts, to the point where hisprivileged statistical reasoning seems far less humanly valid than herimaginative response to child mortality.21[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1380] Having first encounteredMalthus’s work in 1798, Wordsworth later sought to bridge the gulf between thesubjective lives of the poor and the privileged by espousing projects fornational education as a means of rescuing the underclass from material and moraldisaster.22 [71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1378] A vignette ofincomprehension in the Lyrical Ballads thus became, in later works such as hisepic The Excursion (1814), a passionate plea for moral and religious educationfor all in order to induct all children, rich and poor, into the mental cultureof a single community. The poem’s authoritative speaker The Wanderer yearns fora time whenthis Imperial Realm. . . . shall admitAn obligation, on her part, to teachThem who are born to serve her and obey;Binding herself by Statute to secureFor all the Children whom her soil maintainsThe rudiments of Letters, and to informThe mind with moral and religious truthBoth understood, and practised, – so that none,However destitute, be left to droopBy timely culture unsustained, or runInto wild a disorder; or be forcedTo drudge through weary life without the aidOf intellectual implements and tools;A savage Horde among the civilized,A servile Band among the lordly free!23[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1376]Wordsworth’s concern here is with the Malthusian specter of division between the“civilized” and the “savage Horde” who may live in a state of cognitive,economic, and moral deprivation. Education must heal this rift in humanconsciousness, or else, from Wordsworth’s conservative perspective, “wilddisorder” and social unrest may ensue.For some commentators, Malthus’s assertion of the ecological basis of humanhistory, beneath the superstructure of “progress,” civilization, and humanhistorical consciousness, amounts to a fundamental break with the Enlightenment.For the theologian John Milbank, Malthus’s work has “something of the characterof an ‘epistemic switch’” from the Enlightened era of Smith because it reinsertspolitical economy into a providential framework and replaces the unplannedcollaboration of Smith’s economy with a more hectic vision of human striving.This striving, though it may yield social progress, is really an end initself.24 [71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1374] For GertrudeHimmelfarb, Malthus, though indebted to Smith, inaugurated an entirely new wayof thinking about poverty. Where Smith had posited a continuum between theentire body of the poor and the nation as a whole, Malthus consigned poverty toa different realm of recurrent misery and scarcity, and rather than restatingthe traditional view that the poor will always be with us, he set out todemonstrate that poverty, though it might be greatly mitigated, could neverentirely be brought to an end.25[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1372]Malthus’s Romantic critics undoubtedly saw the 1803 Essay as an entirely new andpernicious development in what came to be known as the “dismal science.” Evenwhere they agreed that population checks would eventually occur, they insistedthat these would only take place in a very distant future when the whole worldhad been cultivated and that it was doom-mongering to suggest otherwise. TheEssay came out at a key moment of transition for the first generation ofRomantic writers, after they had acknowledged the failure of the FrenchRevolution and had become disenchanted with Godwin’s ideas of humanperfectibility. Its publication coincided with Coleridge’s and Southey’snewfound identification with the Anglican Church and with a mood of popularpatriotism amid fears of a French invasion.26[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#page_565] Both Winch and Connelldocument in detail the role played by Malthus in the counter-elaboration of theRomantics’ post-radical “anti-economism.” This grew into the fully fledgedconservatism of the 1820s and 1830s, encompassing wider issues such as the CornLaws, Catholic emancipation, the Reform Act of 1832, and, above all, the 1834Poor Law Amendment Act, and shaping a moral critique of industrial society thatstretched to Thomas Carlyle and John Ruskin.27[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1369] Tory anti-economism had avenerable literary history, stretching back to Jonathan Swift’s A ModestProposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People from Being a Burden to TheirParents or Country (1729) in which he mockingly ventriloquized the coldlyreasonable voice of contemporary demographers such as William Petty and JohnGraunt, suggesting that the solution to the problem of Irish overpopulation wasfor parents to eat their own children. Another enormously popular Tory Irishwriter, Oliver Goldsmith, sounded a similar, humanitarian note of protestagainst what he saw as the depopulating consequences of commercialmodernization. In The Deserted Village (1770), a once idyllic village communityis devastated by the local landlord’s estate-building activities, forcing manyof its poor inhabitants to emigrate to the Americas. It fell to the firstgeneration of Romantic writers, however, to fashion this tradition ofhumanitarian Toryism into a coherent Romantic conservatism, as David Eastwoodfirst explained.28 [71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1367]Kevin Gilmartin sees the Romantic anti-Malthusians engaged in a still widerproject as they sought to mobilize and bring cultural depth to the opposition tothe radical reform movements of early nineteenth-century political thinking, byreimagining the established order of church and state.29[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1365] Although their adumbration ofa new conservative politics was actuated by their antagonism, first towardMalthus and then toward David Ricardo, there were many twists and turns in thetale. Southey, Coleridge, Rickman, and Wordsworth in fact agreed with Malthusthat the problem of scarcity was symptomatic of the transition from a landedeconomy to an increasingly urban one based on manufacturing and commerce.30[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1363] In the long run, there was asurprising degree of convergence between Malthus and his Romantic critics,particularly on the need to create a national education system and to protectdomestic agriculture.31 [71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1361]Ironically, Rickman ultimately had a better claim to be the architect of thePoor Law Amendment Act than Malthus.32[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1359]Malthusian ResponsibilitiesIf Romantic conservatism had its origins in the powerful negative inspiration ofMalthus’s ideas, there were other kinds of literary and didactic writings thatdrew heavily on Malthus for new kinds of literary realism and new ways ofadvocating individual moral responsibility in the face of hostile economicconditions. First among these was the work of the poet George Crabbe, whomWilliam Hazlitt dubbed “a Malthus turned Metrical Romancer.”33[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1357] Crabbe (1754–1832) was froman earlier generation than the Romantics but remained popular until themid-nineteenth century.34 [71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1355] Hecame from humble beginnings in Suffolk and knew firsthand the harshness of lifein rural areas far from the metropolis. Early and generous patronage by EdmundBurke cemented his broadly Whig affiliations and may well have occasioneddiscussions of poverty and famine, topics that preoccupied Burke long before hisproto-Malthusian memorandum “Thoughts and Details on Scarcity” (1795).35[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1353] Crabbe achieved early famewith “The Village” (1783), a poem that directly countered Goldsmith’s idyllicportrait of village life by showing poverty to be endemic and grinding, neithercaused nor remediable by individual intervention. Crabbe’s subsequent works weresuffused with the economic hardships of the Napoleonic Wars and with debatesabout the Poor Laws, overpopulation, and food scarcity. In The Parish Register(1807), Crabbe adopted the stance of a clergyman reviewing the registers ofbirths, marriages, and deaths in his parish, as though taking a census, andrecalling their human stories of struggle, deprivation, loss, and violence. Thepoem casts an unsentimental eye on the overcrowded, harsh lives of the poor andtheir abandoned and illegitimate children. In the Edinburgh Review, FrancisJeffrey saluted the social realism of The Parish Register: “Instead ofconducting us through blooming groves and pastoral meadows, [he] had led usalong filthy lanes and crowded wharfs, to hospitals, alms-houses andgin-shops.”36 [71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1351] Here, Jeffreyargues, is an emotional truthfulness sorely lacking in the Romantic Lake poets.Here, implicitly at least, is a Whig poetics of poverty and scarcity (the poemwas read to Charles James Fox on his deathbed). Just as Malthus had done, Crabbeinsinuated that the recognition of elite helplessness in the face of povertymight, in the long run, be more compassionate, more attuned to God’s purpose,and – by avoiding well-intentioned interventions that serve only to perpetuatethe causes of poverty – more effective than Romantic paternalism. Moreover,there exists for the poor the Malthusian remedy of what Crabbe called “prudentdelay,” exemplified in the “Marriages” section by the story of Reuben andRachel, who wait for many years until they can afford to marry and havechildren:Reuben and Rachel though as fond as Doves,Were yet discreet and cautious in their Loves;Nor would attend to Cupid’s wild Commands,Till cool Reflection bade them join their Hands;When both were poor, they thought it argued illOf hasty Love to make them poorer still;Year after year, with Savings long laid by,They bought the future Dwelling’s full Supply.37[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1349]Crabbe’s poems gave dramatic embodiment to Malthus’s prescription for individualmoral restraint in conditions of scarcity, their human agency limited but notwithout some effectiveness in God’s testing world.Crabbe was a great favorite with Jane Austen, and his themes of moral restraint,individual agency, and delayed marriage were indeed topics still more native tothe novel than to poetry.38 [71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1347]Unlike poetry, the more recent genre of the novel was slower in the latereighteenth and early nineteenth centuries to grapple with issues of poverty anddeprivation, and rarely depicted the full spectrum of society. However, as RuthPerry has argued, novelists were nevertheless intensely preoccupied witheconomic vulnerability of various kinds: the threat of eviction, the loss ofshelter, the pressure of rising rents, and the need to downsize to smallerhomes.39 [71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1345] By the earlynineteenth century, novelists were painting society on an ever more broad socialcanvas, and the lives of villagers, cottagers, tenants, and shopkeepersincreasingly surfaced within plots still dominated by the perspectives ofmiddle-class protagonists. Some of the most influential writers to adopt thiswider social purview were both novelists and amateur economists and socialscientists. A prominent example is Maria Edgeworth. The daughter of theimproving Anglo-Irish landlord, Lunar Society member, and educational writerRichard Lovell Edgeworth, she was an established educational theorist beforepublishing a novel that undoubtedly set the stage for wider debates aboutfertility, population, and food management. Her Castle Rackrent (1800) tells, inthe voice of its Irish steward, the story of the mismanagement of an Anglo-Irishestate over four generations of feckless owners, to the point where thelandowners are dispossessed by the steward’s son. Edgeworth vividly dramatizedthe owners’ exploitation of their peasantry as the estate becomes less and lessable to support their most basic needs: Lady Murtagh Rackrent, for example,actually extorts gifts of food from them, even while she requires their childrento work for her free of charge. Edgeworth recapitulated many of these themes inher subsequent fiction including her novel about exploitative Irish landlordism,The Absentee (1812).40 [71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1343] Shebecame a friend of David Ricardo in the 1820s, and the two of them correspondedextensively about Irish food security and other economic matters. She also cameto know Malthus himself.41 [71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1341]Edgeworth was also acquainted with the celebrated Edinburgh University professorDugald Stewart. In his enormously influential lectures on political economy andpopulation, delivered in 1800–1801 to an audience of future luminaries of theEdinburgh Review, Stewart took explicit issue with Malthus by asserting thatpopulation growth was consistent with economic growth, social progress, andliberal political institutions, and that it posed no real threat to the futuresustainability of any of these.42[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1339] Edgeworth’s subsequentfiction, therefore, embraced this lively context of debate in which Malthusianpessimism was tested and challenged, even while she accepted, for example in herPopular Tales (1804) for children, one key premise of the 1803 Essay, that allfamilies should educate their children to take prudent cognizance of theconditions of scarcity in which they live. Edgeworth and Stewart were themselvesthe friends of the Scottish novelist and educational writer Elizabeth Hamilton,whose popular 1808 novel The Cottagers of Glenburnie descended to the filthy,chaotic farmstead of a Scots cottager and his family in order to explore thethemes of scarcity, large family life, and disease among the lower classes. Thenovel tells how Mrs. Mason, a respectable but poor unmarried cousin of thecottager MacClarty family, comes to live with them and tries unsuccessfully tosave them from their poor hygiene, lack of discipline toward their numerouschildren, and failure to maximize their economic opportunities. At one point,Mrs. Mason advises her cousin to ask her children to help to cultivate thegarden in order to provide more food for the family, and on another she wondersat the “perverted ingenuity which could contrive to give to the sleeping roomsof a country house, all the disadvantages which attend the airless abodes ofpoverty in the crowded lanes of great and populous cities.”43[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#page_566] To Mrs. Mason’s mind, theMacClarty family needlessly condemn themselves to a crowded, disease-ridden, andimprovident Malthusian existence. When disaster overtakes them – the husbanddies, and one of the daughters abandons her illegitimate offspring – Mrs. Masonleaves and sets up a school for the poorer children of Glenburnie, with thesupport of her friend “Mr Stewart.” As the Edinburgh Review enthusiasticallyrecognized, the novel provides an education about the degree to which povertycan be mitigated by educated, religiously informed, prudent conduct.44[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1336]The Great Marriage DebateOf equal relevance to the issue of family regulation is the figure of Mrs. Masonherself as a socially useful and morally influential single woman whose dignityin the face of rejection and financial precariousness is rendered by Hamiltonwith sympathy and insight. As I have written elsewhere, Malthus was in his 1803Essay acutely aware that the logic of his argument for moral restraint demandeda rethinking of social attitudes toward unmarried women, widows, and women whodo not have children.45 [71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1334] Inhis chapter “Of the Modes of Correcting the Prevailing Opinions on the Subjectof Population,” he argued vigorously that society should stop stigmatizing oldmaids and treating wives as though they are the social superiors of much olderunmarried women: “It is perfectly absurd, as well as unjust, that a giddy girlof sixteen should, because she is married, be considered by the forms of societyas the protector of women of thirty, should come first into the room, should beassigned the highest place at the table, and be the prominent figure to whom theattentions of the company are more particularly paid.”46[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1332] Moreover, he argued, the malepropensity to regard women past their mid-twenties as unmarriageable blindedthem to the advantages of having few childbearing years within a marriage anddrove women themselves to desperate and unhappy marriages. Female novelists suchas Hamilton and Austen were able to give more positive and sympatheticembodiments to the predicaments that Malthus described: in Pride and Prejudice,the sixteen-year-old, newly married Lydia Bennett triumphs over her unmarriedolder sister Jane, insisting that she must take “her place” at her mother’sright hand, “and you must go lower because I am a married woman.” Likewise,Charlotte Lucas, aged twenty seven, makes the apparently bewildering decision tomarry the odious Mr. Collins.47[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1330]Malthus’s bold and explicit engagements with questions of human fertility,sexual desire, marriage age, and the social stigmatizing of unmarried womenhelped to transform public discourse about marriage in the early nineteenthcentury, from a private, household, and dynastic matter to one that emphasizedthe need for freely choosing individuals to make sensible marriages in thenational interest. For some writers such as Edgeworth and Hamilton this was amatter of explicit engagement with Malthus, while for other popular writers offiction it took the form of a more diffuse yet pervasive preoccupation with therelationship between personal decisions about marriage, child-rearing, and themanagement of the household economy and the stability and prosperity of societyas a whole. Obliquely at least, fiction writers bore witness to the risingpopularity of marriage as a lifestyle choice (by 1801 only around 6.8% of peoplein their early forties had never married, down from around 24.9% a centuryearlier), by thematizing the topic (Susan Ferrier’s successful novel Marriage[1818] being one case in point), and by paying more attention to those women andmen whose economic circumstances denied them access to marriage.The politicization of the domestic sphere and the growing sense that thewell-regulated household was the prerequisite for the well- functioning statewas further reinforced by Malthus’s emphasis on the need for families to justifytheir own economic viability, as well as his belief in the spiritual benefits ofthe economic struggle to survive.48[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1328] The traditional fictionaltopics of marriage, heirs and spares, old maids, and seduced young womenacquired peculiar national resonance during the early nineteenth century. Thiswas particularly reinforced by the ways in which evangelical writers combinedmoral and religious prescriptions with Malthusian warnings. Before Malthus, theevangelical campaigner Hannah More prepared the ground with her Cheap RepositoryTracts (1795–1798), which sold hundreds of thousands of copies and were in themain short, didactic fables about the endeavors of the poor to improve their lotthrough piety, hard work, self-restraint, and social acquiescence. The mostenduring, the “Shepherd of Salisbury Plain” (1795), is about a family of eightwarding off hunger and cold, ultimately rewarded for their resilience.49[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1326] After Malthus’s Essay, More,in her bestselling novel Coelebs in Search of a Wife (1808), took the theme ofrestraint and delay into a more middle-class arena. The young man of the title(Coelebs means bachelor) narrates the considered, lengthy courtship of himselfand his lady, Lucilla, while introducing a wide range of female characters whosefinancial self-reliance or purposeful philanthropy enables them to delaymarriage until the time is right.More wrote at the height of a vogue for evangelical fiction that temporarilyflooded the novel market in the first two decades of the nineteenth century.With starkly moralistic titles such as Temper (1812), Self-Control (1811),Discipline (1814), Correction (1818), and A Father as He Should Be (1815), thesenovels emphasized self-regulation and domestic prudence as essential to theeconomic and political health of the nation.50[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1324] Female characters often hadto face the reality of providing financially for their families, as, forexample, in Barbara Hofland’s three “widow” novels for children in which widowedmothers experience firsthand an adverse ratio of children to resources but learnto survive economically without remarrying.51[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1322] Such novels are Malthusian tothe extent that they are imbued with a sense of the natural vicissitudes ofdisease and scarcity, and of economic calculation as both morally formative forthe individual and part of God’s plan for an educative world. Evangelicalfiction, in other words, partook of the wider assimilation of Malthusian ideasinto the evangelical religious thinking that took place in the years followingthe publication of the 1803 Essay, and that shaped the new Tory “Evangelicaleconomics” described by Boyd Hilton in his The Age of Atonement.52[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1320] Influential evangelicalclerics such as Archbishop of Canterbury John Bird Sumner and the ScottishPresbyterian Thomas Chalmers endeavored to reconcile the principle of populationwith God’s love for humanity; this theodicy works, in Chalmers’s words, bycalling on humanity to exercise its powers of will and sexual self-restraintagainst “the demonstrable inadequacy in all the material resources which theglobe can furnish, for the increasing wants of a recklessly increasing species,”and so giving them a path to salvation.53[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1318]Despite Jane Austen’s often quoted remark, “I do not like the Evangelicals,” hernovels also bear witness to the pervasiveness of intersecting evangelical andMalthusian themes in the early nineteenth century.54[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1316] Austen certainly encounteredMalthus’s ideas either directly or through her reading of Charles Pasley’s Essayon the Military Policy . . . of the British Empire (1810), which discusses hisideas.55 [71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1314] Written at theheight of the evangelical vogue, and taking the name of its heroine, FannyPrice, from Crabbe’s Parish Register, Austen’s Mansfield Park (1814) recordsFanny’s dignified reckoning against her own status as the superfluous daughterof a large family (“nobody at home seemed to want her”), and her struggle toearn her place at her wealthy uncle’s table.56[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1312] Fanny’s adoption by heruncle’s family happens as a result of her mother writing to her relations of herdifficulties with “such a superfluity of children, and such a want of almosteverything else.”57 [71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1310] Herimpoverished parents’ home in Portsmouth is vividly depicted in the novel as“the abode of noise, disorder and impropriety,” teeming with unwanted childrenand memories of a child who did not survive. In Mansfield Park and in her othernovels, Austen engaged profoundly with the experience of what it means to be aredundant female, to be one of too many: Elizabeth Bennet endures a rebuke fromLady Catherine de Bourgh on her family size of five daughters: “Daughters arenever of much consequence to a father.”58[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1308] In a world that simplycalculates the ratio of daughters to resources, Austen’s heroines gain moralstature by refusing to rush into marriage, and by insisting, as Malthusinsisted, that spinsterhood is a better option than the unhappy, over-fertilemarriages of the Bennets or Prices. Austen also depicted sympathetically thesocial and psychological predicament of those women who did not marry, mostmemorably when Mr. Knightley rebukes Emma for making fun of the unmarried MissBates.Austen’s probing of parish registers may have given her a more than intuitivesense of what was later understood as the “surplus woman problem.” It was notuntil the 1851 census that the marital status of household members was listed,prompting a wave of public agonizing over the still large numbers of unmarried,“excess” females.59 [71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1306] AlthoughAusten portrayed the dilution of parental feelings by a too numerous offspring,she did not examine the darker side of human superfluousness in the way thatsome of her contemporary and successor writers did. In Child Murder and BritishCulture, Josephine McDonagh explains how there came about in the nineteenthcentury a new Malthusian understanding of infanticide as something that onlypoverty and desperation could bring about, famously in George Eliot’s Adam Bede(1859), when Hetty Sorrel leaves her illegitimate baby to die having beenabandoned by her lover.60 [71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1304]Other writers highlighted the Malthusian tragedy of enforced displacement, asfor example in Walter Scott’s Guy Mannering (1815) in which a tragic plot is setin motion by a laird’s cruel displacement of a gypsy settlement from his lands.Viewed from another angle, it occurred to many commentators that the evictionand emigration of surplus peoples might offer a potential solution to populationpressure. Malthus himself stated in the 1803 Essay that he thought emigration “avery weak palliative” for the problem of overpopulation, but nevertheless foundhimself drawn into a series of public debates about the issue in the 1820s whenBritish and Irish emigration to the colonies and North America was risingrapidly.61 [71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#page_567] Malthus appearedbefore a Parliamentary Select Committee on emigration convened by the undersecretary of state for the colonies, Robert Wilmot-Horton, who was consideringoptions for state-sponsored emigration as a way of alleviating poverty andovercrowding. Wilmot-Horton’s project for a national colonization scheme as ameans of indefinitely postponing Britain and Ireland’s Malthusian future (oftencaricatured as “shovelling out paupers”) was ably supported by Rickman, Southey,Wordsworth, and other Tories, although it was not ultimately funded.62[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1301] The broader issue ofdisplacement and migration became a prevalent topos in nineteenth-centuryfiction.63 [71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1299] Some novelistsfollowed Goldsmith’s Deserted Village in their bleak portrayal of emigrantexile, but for many, emigration offered a real alternative to overcrowded lifeat home. At the end of Elizabeth Gaskell’s Mary Barton (1848), for instance, theprotagonist and her husband leave behind congested, industrial Manchester for anew life in Canada, and in Dickens’s David Copperfield (1850), the perpetuallyindigent Mr. Micawber and his numerous family successfully emigrate to Australiaand become sheep farmers.64 [71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1297]In the 1803 edition, Malthus revised his Essay on the Principle of Population insuch a way as to give his readers a sense of the choices available to humanityin the face of dark inevitabilities. Commentators have tended to focus on theinevitabilities more than the choices, ascribing to the Essay a persistentstrain of pessimistic “Malthusian” thinking that underpinned the 1834 Poor LawAmendment Act and haunted the nineteenth-century conception of poverty. WilliamCobbett’s anti-amendment act comedy Surplus Population (1831) features aMalthusian squire, Peter Thimble, who spends the entire play trying to dissuadea young country girl from marrying and having babies: “Nothing can save thecountry but plague, pestilence, famine, and sudden death. Government ought toimport a shipload of arsenic. [To her] But young woman, cannot you impose onyourself ‘moral restraint’ for ten or a dozen years?”65[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1295]Although this caricature of Malthus is undoubtedly part of the story, closerattention to the contemporary reception of the Essay suggests that it helped toreframe discourse about life expectancy, marriage, women, and fertility in waysthat emphasized the importance of human decision-making within a certain,limited compass. The Malthusian feminist Harriet Martineau, for example, in herbestselling Illustrations of Political Economy (1832–1834), tells the story of aScottish widow who decides not to remarry and have more children; the widowrecognizes that the populous island community in which she lives can no longerbe supported by dwindling local fishing stocks and that famine may ensue if thecommunity does not take charge of its destiny.66[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1293] Other Malthusians advocatedbirth control. Accepting the diagnosis, but not the remedial actions, of the1803 Essay, the radical Francis Place made the case in his Illustrations andProofs of the Principle of Population (1822) that “it is not disreputable formarried persons to avail themselves of such precautionary means as would,without being injurious to health, or destructive to female delicacy, preventconception.”67 [71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1291] John StuartMill warmly espoused Place’s neo-Malthusian birth-control campaign, on theradical grounds that the working classes, if they could regulate their ownnumbers, might command higher wages.68[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1289] Contraception was a practicethat Malthus classed among the “improper arts to conceal the consequences ofirregular connexions,” less, perhaps, from motives of Anglican prudishness thanout of concern that it would distract society from its true obligation toconfront the providential purpose served by population pressure.69[71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1287] Nevertheless, in this greatrevolution in the human shaping of natural destiny, the 1803 Essay certainlyplayed its part.NOTES1 [71_The_Cultural_and_Literary_Signif.html#id_1418].
