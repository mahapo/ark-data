[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Did you know... ? • The so-called “Federal Reserve” central bank is NOT A FEDERAL ENTITY . It is simply contracted by Congress, and consists of a network of privately owned international banks! According to Article I Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution, only Congress is permitted to “coin” money. In other words, only ELECTED representatives were intended to have a say in the production of money. The government is absolutely NOT AUTHORIZED to delegate this duty to a network of private corporations, especially international corporations! Did you know that? • The so-called “Federal Reserve” contains NO RESERVES of any commodity to stabilize the value of the U.S. dollar! On August 15, 1971, President Nixon officially ended the Gold Standard, and severed all remaining ties between the “Federal Reserve Note” and anything of real value. This turned the so-called “dollar” into a FIAT CURRENCY hardly worth the paper it's printed on. Getting angry yet? • The so-called “ F ederal R eserve N ote” (FRN) is a complete misnomer. The legal definition of a “note” is a promissory bill that binds the issuer to OWE the recipient the declared amount. The original intent of the FRN was to act as a legal note so that anyone could exchange a FRN for its equivalent weight in gold or silver . That is no longer the case, and therefore, every single word in the phrase “Federal Reserve Note” is a ABSOLUTE LIE! How does this make you feel? • The “Federal Reserve” charges interest on the creation of FRNs, leaving all users of this worthless currency in an INESCAPABLE and perpetually-growing cycle of DEBT . This pyramidal monopoly makes it absolutely impossible for the users of the currency to ever pay back what they “owe” to the Federal government. Do you like that? • The “Federal Reserve” DEVALUES YOUR MONEY through incessant production of FRNs (a.k.a. inflation). Contrary to conventional economic belief, inflation is actually a rather simple concept – the more of anything that is produced, the LESS VALUE it holds. Do you think this holds true for FRNs as well? So what can you do?
