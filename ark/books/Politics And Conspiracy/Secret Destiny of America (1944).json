[{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" 1. THE ORIGIN OF THE DEMOCRATIC IDEAL World democracy was the secret dream of the great c lassical philosophers. ... Thousands of years before Columbus they were aware of the existence of our Western Hemisphere and selected it to be the site o f the philosophic empire. ... The brilliant plan of the Ancients has survived to our time, and it will continue to function until the great work is accomplished. ... The American nation desperately needs a vision of i ts own purpose. A MERICA can not refuse the challenge of leadership in the postwar world. Mere physical reconstruction of ravaged countries and the reorgan ization of political, economic, and social systems is the lesser task we will face. The larger problem and t he great challenge is in how to set up a new order of world ethics firmly established on a foundation of democr atic idealism. Experts in various fields have already submitted pr ograms designed to meet the needs of those nations whose way of life has been disrupted by war. But w ith the failing common to specially trained minds, these planners incline to think mostly in the terms of th eir own particular interests. As yet, no one has t ouched the fundamentals of international ethics. No one has a dvanced a working plan securely based upon a broad, deep, and sympathetic understanding of the human being and his problems. The thinking has been in the du al fields of power politics and material economics, with reme dies expressed in terms of charts, blueprints, patt erns, and industrial programs. But, there is one new and encouraging element prese nt in most of the recommendations of today's experts. They are recognizing the necessity of con ceiving the world as one inter-dependent structure. Yet, even as they recognize the need for a unity of huma n interests, their recommendations are for the perp etuation of highly competitive economic policies, which, if they are consistently applied, must lead in the end to war and discord. It is not an easy task to unite the efforts of the human race toward the accomplishment of any common good. Mankind in the majority is selfish, provinci al in attitude, and concerned primarily with person al success and acquiring creature comforts. It will not be po ssible to build an enduring peace until the average man has been convinced that personal selfishness is detrime ntal to personal happiness and personal success. I t must be"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"shown that self-seeking has gone out of fashion, an d that the world is moving on to a larger conceptio n of living. The postwar planners have more of idealism in their programs than has ever before been expressed in the problem of the relationships of nations. But i t still is not enough. A clear and complete statem ent of a world purpose is required--a world dream great enou gh to inspire unity of world effort. These are the days of America's opportunity to lead a still troubled mankind toward a better way of li fe. If we meet this challenge, we will insure not only survival of our nation for centuries to come, but w e shall gain the enduring gratitude of our fellowmen and America ns will be remembered to the end of time as a great enlightened people. It is not enough that we solve particular problems. We must solve the very cause of problem itself. Wars, depressions, crime, dictators and their oppre ssions, are the symptoms giving clear indication of a greater ailment. To examine each problem solely in terms o f the problem itself, without recognition of its tr ue relationship to a larger and more universal necessi ty, is to fail in the broader implications of an en during peace and prosperity. Experience should have taught us long ago that poli cies which have originated from material con- siderations and attitudes have proved inadequate. The whole story of civilization and the records of history tell us that all such adjustments hold no hope of lastin g peace or security. But, here we are again prepar ing ourselves to be satisfied with temporary solutions for permanent problems. The recognition is long overdue that we oversimplif y the problem of world peace when we think that process is one of breaking the task down for examin ation of its materialistic parts, and then hopefull y devising an applicable remedy for each of these. The physic al conditions of human existence are not the whole of the human problem. We could adjust all material consid erations to the point of supremest equity, and yet accomplish virtually nothing solutional. The greatest of known problems is the human problem . And not until all embracing examination is made into every phase of human needs can there be a n adequate reconstruction policy for a postwar worl d. That man is physical is obvious; but he is also me ntal, and emotional; he is spiritual, and he has a soul. These latter factors are not so obvious. What to do about them is not so easy; for they are difficult to understand, and even more difficult to classify and reduce to a working pattern. We as bu ilders of a civilization will have to learn that on ly when equal consideration is given to each of these eleme nts of man's nature will we arrive at the solutions for the disasters into which men and nations precipitate th emselves. Our postwar reconstructors--ours, if not by our sel ection, at least with our consent--are not outstand ingly qualified for this broader task. Few indeed are th e statesmen and politicians who have any conception of man as a spiritual being. And as for military leaders, they are primarily disciplinarians, invaluable as such in times of war, but not at all emotionally geared to proble ms of individualistic peacetime character. And wor ld plan- ners recruited from among our industrial leaders, i t must be admitted, are not generally informed on t he workings of the human psyche. Those who have made the study of human conduct their life work, the sociologists, have little scientific knowledge of t he hidden springs that animate that very conduct in to its amazing diversity of manifestations. And if a word is to be said for bringing in the clergy, it might be that the theologian planner who will be truly useful will be one who acquires at least some knowledge of the sc ience of biology. We are displaying a woeful lack of vision in the wa y we fumble with the eternal laws of life. It is n ot enough that we now hopefully create a setup permitt ing men to give allegiance with their minds or to s erve faithfully with their bodies. We must some day fac e the truth that man is inevitably and incurably an idealist; for this is the truth that will set us free. Man's need is for the idealistic content of his nature t o be properly nourished; then his whole consciousness will impel him to right action -and then no more will our laws fail, treaties be broken, and the rights of man stand vio lated. The American nation desperately needs a vision of i ts own purpose. It must conceive it in a generous idealism, great and strong enough to bind thoughtle ss and selfish persons to something bigger than the mselves. It must recognize that it is in the intangible idea l that the foundations are laid for all seeable goo d, must know that the truly practical course and the course of h ard realism for America is the one that is laid bas ically in a generous idealism. This is more than an indicated course. It is one t hat we inevitably must follow, guided by the hand o f destiny."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Believing this to be so, I dedicate this book to th e proposition that American Democracy is part of a Universal Plan. Our world is ruled by inflexible laws which control not only the motions of the heavenly bodies, but t he consequences of human conduct. These Universal mot ions, interpreted politically, are impelling human society out of a state of autocracy and tyranny to democrac y and freedom. This motion is inevitable, for the growth of humans is a gradual development of mind over matter , and the motion itself represents the natural and reasonable unfoldment of the potentials within huma n character. Those who attempt to resist this motion destroy the mselves. To cooperate with this motion, and to assist Nature in every possible way to the accompli shment of its inevitable purpose, is to survive. Thousands of years before the beginning of the Chri stian era many enlightened thinkers discovered the will of God as expressed through Nature in the affa irs of men. They made known their discoveries in t erms of religions, philosophies, sciences, arts, and politi cal systems. These first statements are now the ad mired monuments of ancient learning. Available to men of today, they are generally ignored. Years of research among the records of olden people s available in libraries, museums, and shrines of ancient cultures, has convinced me that there exist s in the world today, and has existed for thousands of years, a body of enlightened humans united in what might be termed, an Order of the Quest. It is composed of t hose whose intellectual and spiritual perceptions have r evealed to them that civilization has a Secret Dest iny--secret, I say, because this high purpose is not realized by the many; the great masses of peoples still live along without any knowledge whatsoever that they are part of a Un iversal Motion in time and space. Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle, Buddha, Jesus and Moh ammed are among the greatest names recorded in history; but it is not customary to regard the men who bore these names as statesmen or sociologists. They are thought of as philosophers, sages, seers, and mysti cs, whose doctrines have no application to the poli tical needs of an industrial civilization. Yet it is men like Plato and Buddha who still exercise the most powerf ul force in mortal affairs toward the perpetuation and preserva tion of a civilized state among all nations. All of the great leaders of ancient times realized and taught that the establishment of a state of per - manent peace among the nations depended upon the re lease of human ideals, but through properly trained and disciplined minds capable of interpreting these ide als in terms of the common good. World democracy was the secret dream of the great c lassical philosophers. Toward the accomplishment of this greatest of all human ends they outlined pr ograms of education, religion, and social conduct d irected to the ultimate achievement of a practical and univers al brotherhood. And in order to accomplish their p urposes more effectively, these ancient scholars bound them selves with certain mystic ties into a broad confra ternity. In Egypt, Greece, India, and China, the State Mysterie s came into existence. Orders of initiated priestp hilosophers were formed as a sovereign body to instruct, advise , and direct the rulers of the States. Thousands of years ago, in Egypt, these mystical or ders were aware of the existence of the western hemisphere and the great continent which we call Am erica. The bold resolution was made that this west ern continent should become the site of the philosophic empire. Just when this was done it is impossible now to say, but certainly the decision was reached prior t o the time of Plato, for a thinly veiled statement of this resolution is the substance of his treatise on the Atlantic Islands. One of the most ancient of man's constructive ideal s is the dream of a universal democracy and a cooperation of all nations in a commonwealth of Sta tes. The mechanism for the accomplishment of this ideal was set in motion in the ancient temples of Greece, Egypt, and India. So brilliant was the plan and s o well was it administrated that it has survived to our time, and it will continue to function until the great wo rk is accomplished. Philosophy set up its house in the world to free me n by freeing them of their own inordinate desires a nd ambitions. It saw selfishness as the greatest crim e against the common good, for selfishness is natur al to all who are untutored. It recognized that the mind has to be trained in the laws of thinking before men c an be capable of self-rulership. And it knew that the de mocratic commonwealth can be a reality only when ou r world is a world of self-ruling men. And so it is from the remote past, from the deep sh adows of the medieval world as well as from the early struggles of more modern times, that the powe r of American democracy has come. But we are only on the threshold of the democratic state. Not only mu st we preserve that which we have gained through ag es of striving, we must also perfect the plan of the ages , setting up here the machinery for a world brother hood of nations and races. This is our duty, and our glorious opportunity."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"It seems to me that the basic plan for the postwar world should be one solidly founded in this great dream of Universal Brotherhood.

"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 2. THE WORLD'S FIRST DEMOCRAT The leader who had the first social consciousness i n the administration of a nation was a Pharaoh of Egypt, Akhnaton. ... Born several thousand years too soon, he was the first realist in democracy, the first hu manitarian, the first internationalist. ... He saw that the duty of the ruler is to protect for all the right to live well, to think, to dream, to hope, and to aspire. ... For his dream of the Brotherhood of Man he cheerful ly gave his life. M AN has passed out of the state of savagery and become a civilized creature with the development of social consciousness. Civilization is a collective state. In our collective type of life the isolati onist is a detriment to himself and a menace to all others. There is a great difference between isolationism an d intellectualism. Development of the mind release s the individual from mob psychology, but it does not set him apart from the common responsibilities of his kind. A true thinker becomes a force for good with in the group life. If his intellectual powers lure him away from the practical problems and values of his world , he can no longer make his contribution to the soc ial unity. Political reforms are not accomplished by the peopl e, but through the people. Behind all collective progress stands the enlightened individual's leader ship. His superiority does not free him from commo n responsibility; his is the obligation to assume the greater burden of directing his vision to the well being of all his people. Let us see how this works. We'll go far back to an cient times. Akhnaton, Pharaoh of Egypt, throned under the title Amen-Hotep IV, is often referred to as the first civilized human being. While this may not be liter ally true, he was definitely the first man in recor ded history to exemplify social consciousness in the administra tion of a great nation. Akhnaton, the beloved child of the Aton, was born a t Thebes about 1388 B.C. Like most of the princes of his house, he was extremely delicate as a child, and it was feared that he would not live to reach the throne; as the last of his line, the dynasty would end with him if he died without issue. For this reason he was married in his twelfth year to a ten year old Egyptian girl of noble birth, named Nefertiti. During the childhood of the young king, the Queen m other, Tiy, ruled as regent of the double empire. She is believed to have been of Syrian origin, whic h would account for the many strange and un-Egyptia n ideas in religion, government and art which were develope d during the reign of Akhnaton. Queen Tiy, brillia nt and"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"capable, had recognized before her son reached his majority that in him were qualities more divine tha n human. The son became the actual ruler of his coun try in his eighteenth year; his reign extended for seventeen years. Akhnaton had been ruler of Egypt only about two yea rs when he opposed his will to the priesthood of Amon-Ra. By attacking the oldest and most firmly e stablished of all Egyptian institutions, the young Pharaoh created legions of enemies and brought down upon hi mself the wrath of the religion of the State. He c ould scarcely have chosen a surer way of complicating th e problems of his life. In the midst of this conflict he proclaimed a new s piritual dispensation, and to escape his enemies bu ilt a new capitol city, one hundred and sixty miles up th e Nile from Cairo. His new faith was Atonism; and he named his city Khut-en-Aton--the Horizon of the Ato n--and dedicated the city with these words: \"Ye be hold the City of the Horizon of Aton, which the Aton has desired me to make for Him as a monument, in the g reat name of My Majesty forever. For it was Aton, my Fa ther, that brought me to this City of the Horizon.\" As High Priest of his new religion, Amen-Hotep IV c hanged his name to Akhnaton, because the older name included the word Amen, whose faith he had rej ected. Charles F. Potter, in his History of Religion , says of Akhnaton that he was, \"the first pacifist , the first realist, the first monotheist, the first democrat, the first heretic, the first humanitarian, the firs t internationalist, and the first person known to attempt to found a re ligion. He was born out of due time, several thous and years too soon.\" From his twenty-sixth year to his thirty-first year , Akhnaton devoted his life to the perfection of hi s mystical doctrine in the city which he had built fo r the Ever Living God. Here he taught the mystery of the Divine Father, and wrote the simple and beautiful p oems which have endured and survived time. To Akhn aton, God was not a mighty warrior ruling over Egypt, spe aking through the oracles of his priests; he was n ot a Supreme Being flying through the air in a war chari ot leading armies of destruction. Aton was the gen tle father who loved all his children, of every race and natio n; and desired for them that they should live toget her in peace and comradeship. Even more, God, the Aton, had created all the lesse r creatures, whether birds that nested in the papyr us reeds along the banks of the Nile, or dragonflies w ith many colored wings that hovered over quiet pool s and the lotus blooms. The Aton was the father of all beast s, and fishes, and flowers, and insects. He had fa shioned them in his wisdom and preserved them with his love and tenderness. Akhnaton, seated in the garden of his palace, spent many hours watching the flight of birds and listen ing to the voices of little creatures. He tells us tha t he found the Aton in all of them; and that his he art went out to them, and he gave thanks for the goodness in everyt hing that lived. This was a Pharaoh who traveled alone through the c ountryside, meeting the peasants, conversing with slaves, and sharing the simple food of the poor. T o the most ignorant man he listened with profound r espect, for in each of his subjects he sought and found the life of the Aton. He saw the Universal God shinin g through the eyes of little children, beheld the beauty of t he Aton in the bodies of the men who worked in the fields. He could not understand why others did not see God in everything, as he did. Like most of the great religious leaders, Akhnaton accepted the social problem of life as part of religion. He could not accept the inequalities of birth, wealth, or physical estate as a justificatio n for men persecuting each other or exploiting one another. He saw every living thing having a divine right--a right to live well, to think, to dream, to hope, and to aspi re. He saw it the duty of the ruler to protect thi s beauty in the hearts of his people, to nourish it, and to give ev ery possible opportunity for its expression and per fection. Religious intolerance was impossible among those wh o worshipped the Atan, and there was no room for political intolerance in a world governed by the la ws of brotherly love. Each man became the protecto r and comforter of all other men, cherishing the dreams o f others equally with his own. In his personal life Akhnaton emerges as the first man in history to bring dignity and gentle beauty t o the management of his home. He was the father of s even daughters, to whom he was completely devoted, and in his speeches and public pronouncements he always referred to Queen Nefertiti as \"my beloved wife.\" It was usual for the Pharaohs to cause themselves t o be depicted in great stone carvings upon the wall s of their palaces. They were represented as majesti c figures, crowned and sceptered; they were shown either seated on their thrones or wielding their weapons a gainst their foes. Akhnaton was the only Pharaoh i n the history of Egypt who chose to be depicted with his arm about his wife, with his little daughters playi ng about and seated on his lap."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"As with the passing years the health of the Pharaoh grew worse, the opposition of the priesthood of Amon-Ra grew greater; and his reign was complicated by invasions by the Hittite nations. The governor s of various provinces pleaded with him for help, but Ak hnaton would not send armies. The dreamer king saw his lands pillaged and his cit ies conquered; but he would not kill his enemies; they, too, were children of the Aton. Akhnaton died in his thirty-sixth year, at the alta r of the Aton in the temple of the faith he had cre ated. When his mummy case was found, the following prayer to the Aton was discovered inscribed on golden foi l beneath his feet. \"I breathe the sweet breath whic h comes forth from Thy mouth. I behold Thy beauty every day .... Give me Thy hands, holding Thy spirit, tha t I may receive it and may be lifted by it. Call T hou upon my name unto eternity, and it shall never fail.\" In the words of the great Egyptologist, Professor B reasted, \"There died with him such a spirit as the world had never seen before.\" Akhnaton was the first man in history who dared to dream of the Brotherhood of Men, and he cheerfully gave his life and his empire for that dream. He is indeed, \"The beautiful child of the Living At on, whose name shall live forever and ever.\" "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 3 WESTWARD OCEAN TRAVEL TO THE EARTHLY PARADISE From Plutarch's description of voyages it can be ca lculated that our great continent in the Western Hemisphere was visited by the ancien t Greeks; they not only reached our shores but explored part of the Great Lakes area. ... Under a thin veil of symbolism they perpetuated in mythology their knowledge of our land, which they called blessed .... The are a was anciently set apart for coming generations in the great human experiment of the democratic com monwealth. T HE ancient Greeks had a far better knowledge of geogr aphy than popular opinion today indicates. We have been deceived as to the full measure of classi cal learning, because the Greeks did not commit the larger part of their knowledge to writing, and they bound scholarship with the vow of secrecy. In ancient days all learning was regarded as sacred ; wisdom was entrusted to the keeping of priest- philosophers; and they were permitted to communicat e the choicest branches of the sciences only to dul y initiated pupils. To bestow knowledge upon those w ho had not prepared their minds by years of discipl ine and self-purification profaned the mysteries, desecrate d the sacred sciences. Some years ago, in discussing this fine point in et hics with the late Professor James Breasted, the mo st distinguished of American Egyptologists, he confirm ed my own findings; and further stated it to be his personal conviction that the classical civilizations conceal ed most of their learning under legends, myths, and allegories; and these have long been mistakenly accepted as the literal beliefs of these peoples. There can be no doubt that the existence of a great continent in the Western Hemisphere was known to the ancient Greeks. And also to the Egyptians and the Chinese. It is nothing short of foolish to ass ume that the ancients lacked ships sufficiently seaworthy to nav igate the larger oceans. Long before the Christian era, the older civilization had constructed boats far larger and more seaworthy than any of the vessels used by Columbus. One of the Ptolemys of Egypt built a shi p large enough to have an orchard of fruit trees on the deck, together with swimming pools and fountains stocked with live fish. Calculations based upon Plutarch's description of a ncient voyages seem to indicate that the Greeks not only reached the coast of America, but explored the St. Lawrence river and part of the Great Lakes are a. Plato, in his treatise on the destruction of Atlantis, wro te that due to the commotions in the ocean caused b y the submergence of a vast continent, all navigation to the west ceased for a long period of time. This st atement can only imply that such navigation had taken place in remote times. Greek mythology perpetuates the knowledge of a bles sed land beyond the Western Boundaries of Ocean. In this blessed land dwelt the Hesperides, the beautiful daughters of Night, and here also at the end of each day the sun came to rest. In popular mytholog y the Hesperic Isles were a kind of terrestrial par adise. Thus, under a thin veil of mystic symbolism, was co ncealed the account of a Western continent of great size, fertile and rich and abounding in all good th ings. The ancients believed the earth to be surrounded by the sphere of the constellations, and they assigne d to each country the star groups which were above th at country's particular area of land. In the arran gement preserved in the writings of Aratus of Soli, the co nstellation of the eagle spreads its wings accross the North American continent; the serpent winds its coil over Mexico and Central America; and the dragon floats in the sky above Japan and China. Perhaps Sir Edward Land seer was not far wrong when he declared that the symbols of nations, and the emblems peculiar to the ir heraldry, originated in their ruling constellati ons. Just about everyone knows that the constellation of the Great Bear is in the sky aver Russia, and since tim e immemorial the bear that walks like a man has been the accepted symbol of the Russian State. Thus in many ways we discover indications that the old races were wiser than we thought, and that what we have called discoveries are really only re-disco veries. Beyond the western bounds of the ocean they located the fair land set aside by the gods to be the eart hly paradise. Here in the fulness of time all men woul d come in search of the Golden Fleece which hung up on the tree sacred to the apples of the sun; and the early explorers did travel to the West in search of a Go lden Fleece-- the gold of the Incas, the treasures of the Aztecs, and the jeweled temples of the seven cities of Cib ola. It was in an old book which is in the British Museu m that I found another and even more important key to the meaning of the Golden Fleece. It was known to the Greeks that the Golden Fleece was in reality a"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"parchment on which was written the secret of human immortality. It was this parchment that Jason soug ht, for whoever discovered it would gain the secret of endu ring empire, and power over the whole world.

Those who understand it and can use wisely t he import of its writings are possessed of the secr et of the immortality of human society. The curious fortunes of war brought another Golden Fleece from across the sea, and it is now preserved together with our own; this second parchment is the Magna Charta, the English bill of human rights whi ch was the inspiration behind our American Declaration of Independence. These two immortal documents togethe r form the declaration of the rights of man and are t he basic texts of modern democracy. By the wisdom then of those gods who are eternally vigilant over the needs of man, the blessed lands o f the west were set apart, for none of the great civi lizations of the past rose in North America to over shadow the continent with the ruins of old tradition, or to se t up the corruptions of old administrative policy. Foreign nations came to this continent in times long ago; b ut they formed no permanent settlements nor attempt ed any program of colonization. And so the soil was not i mpoverished by thousands of years of intensive cult ivation, nor were the natural resources ravished to supply t he substance to maintain endless wars and ageless f euds. It was the rise of the democratic dream in Europe t hat supplied the beginning of western civilization. Those in search of a promised land turned to the we st. Here was a virgin continent populated only by nomadic Indian tribes, a vast territory suitable in every w ay for the great human experiment of the democratic commonwealth. By the nineteenth century the American Hesperides w as definitely the land of golden opportunity, and to it came streams of immigration from nearly every country on the earth. The better way of life drew them here, for it had been established that here men cou ld build a future free of tyranny, intolerance, and enforced poverty. Here all were given opportunity for educa tion, for free enterprise, and living a life accord ing to the dictates of hope and conscience. If in a comparatively short time many racial stream s have met and mingled, and a new race has been born, the American race is not one to be determined by an analysis of blood or the proportions of the cranium. Americans are a race determined by the measure of a conviction, set apart by that conviction; it is t he conviction that human beings are created free, and are entitled to equal opportunity to perfect themse lves in life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And in recent years we have made another discovery. It is that the race of democracy is one distribut ed throughout the whole world. Among men and women of all races and all nations are those who share our conviction, and because they share it they are of o ur kind and belong to our race. In this realizatio n we mark the beginning of world democracy. Wise men, the ancients believed, were a separate ra ce, and to be born into this race it was necessary to develop the mind to a state of enlightened intellig ence. The old philosophers taught that physical bi rth is an accident, for men are born into various races and n ationalities according to the laws of generation; b ut there is a second birth, which is not an accident; it is the c onsequence of a proper intent. By this second birt h man is born by enlightened intelligence out of nation and out o f race into an international nation and an internat ional race. It is this larger and coming race that will some da y inherit the earth. But unless a man be born agai n by enlightenment, he shall not be a part of the philos ophic empire. Our age of gold will pass and some day the Golden A ge will come again. A future greatness is right now casting its long shadow across the face of Natu re. With each passing generation the responsibilit ies of the American people will increase. More and more we sh all be looked to as a source of courage, strength, and hope. And it will be in this way that we shall fulfill th e destiny for which our nation was created by dream ers of long ago. From the Blessed Isles of the West mu st come the fulfillment of the promise of the ages.

When he later journeyed to Egypt, he there learned of the first war of conquest, in the story of the l ost Atlantis, and became acquainted with the imperishable laws fo r the government of nations. D EBT has been the common burden of the ages, and yet th e whole structure of our modern economic world is built on the shaky foundation of Bills Pay able and Bills Receivable. Long ago, interest ate up its own principal, and we terest on our own are currently l iving on the inunliquidated debts. Solon, greatest statesman of the Greek world, was h anded this age-old problem when, about 595 B.C., he was summoned to the leadership of the State with the title, Archon. He was given unlimited powers to reform the economic and constitutional systems of t he Athenians. His first move was to attack the old Attic law of debt which he believed lay at the source of the public distress. In the time of Solon, the Greek countryside was lit tered with roughly hewn stone markers. Originally these were boundary stones fixing the property line s of the lands of various citizens. As time had pa ssed, it had become the custom to carve into these stones the re cords of mortgage contracts affecting the property which they bounded. Single stones became insufficient af ter a time, and eventually the added monuments to d ebt interfered with the plowing of the fields. Solon, investigating the tragedy of the mortgage mo nument, made several interesting discoveries that were to change the course of human economics. When poor farmers mortgaged their lands to rich familie s on neighboring estates, and the debts were not paid, t he wealthy landowners moved their boundary stones t o include the encumbered property, and the previous p roprietors became tenants. These tenants were obli ged to pay one-sixth of their products for the privilege o f working the soil; and if they failed their person s were attached and they became slaves. This was the Atti c law which Solon abolished, the law which permitte d loans on the security of the debtor's person. When Solon restored the freedom of all who had been enslaved for debt, the reform was highly acceptable of course to the poorer classes; but it found little favor with the landowners. They imme diately set to work in a conspiracy to discredit Solon and forc e him out of office. Thus, back in very olden days , when life was very simple, the basic problems which harassed the State and burdened the legislators stemmed from the persisting fallacies of human nature. In further effort to bring some semblance of order out of the Athenian chaos, Solon also attempted a reorganization of social classes, giving political existence to large groups never before represented in government. He divided the citizenry into four gro ups reminiscent of old Brahman castes. He then rea djusted taxation so that the poorer classes all paid equall y an approximate 5 percent of their income. Equali zing the tax burden according to individual means paved the way for an equality of representation in the governing body. All citizens who paid taxes were entitled to be hea rd in matters of the common good, and were privileg ed to elect magistrates. These steps marked the beginnin g of the democracy of the ancient Greeks. But the greatest of all of the reforms of Solon too k place in the courts of justice. Selection of jur ies was by lot, with all citizens participating, even the p oorest; and these juries were upheld over the press ures of established privileged groups. One of the most curious of Solon's regulations thro ws light on the difficulties of his time. He forba de that a bride should bring to the house of her husba nd more than three changes of garment and ‘like per sonal furniture.' He also ordained that each citizen mus t stand ready to show at any time to properly autho rized persons how he obtained his living. Any citizen fa iling to do this would lose his franchise. The drastic changes of Solon made him so many enemi es that after a few years he felt he had to relinquish the burden of leadership of the State to regain his honor. Those who hated and feared him, as Archon, promptly renewed their love after he left p ublic office and no longer threatened their ambitio ns. His term as Archon brought to Solon the realization of his own inadequacy; and he visited Egypt in search of a larger wisdom. He was received with ki ndness and every mark of respect by the priests at Sais who served the shrine of the Goddess Isis. To these wi se men he told the story of his effort to enlighten the Greeks,"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"and correct the evils in their laws. The High Prie st of Sais is reported to have said, \"Alas, you Gre eks, you are but children; for you know not the wisdom of the go ds.\" One night the priests of Sais led Solon through the long dark pasageways of the temple. They descended stone stairs rutted with age and lighted only by flaming torches, came at length to subterra nean chambers hewn from the living rock. Through these chambers flowed a river. The priests said that thi s river was the sacred Nile that flowed from Egypt through the underworld to water the fields of the immortals . On the bank of the underground stream a small black boat w as waiting, rowed by men who were blind. Accompanied by the High Priest and the torch bearer s, Solon was rowed out over the dark waters. The boat stopped on the shores of a tiny island far und er ground. The light from the torches fell on two tall columns that glistened; they appeared to be made of some s trange metal, covered with curious writing in an un known language. The High Priest, pointing his golden rod at the pil lars, explained their mystery to the astonished Sol on. These columns, he said, were placed on the island b eneath the ground thousands of years ago by a lost people which had vanished forever from the earth. The pil lars were of an unknown metal which neither rusted nor deteriorated with age. He continued: Once long ago there existed on the e arth a vast empire, the power of which extended to every corner of the world, and great fleets of merc hant ships sailed the seven seas and brought their wealth to its fabulous city of the Golden Gate. Here there w ere schools for the study of the mysteries of Natur e; towers for the examination of the stars; mines beneath th e earth from which the precious metals were brought forth in abundance. This empire was ruled over by seven kin gs, who were the descendents of Neptune, God of the Seas. Then came the fatal day when the seven kings of the Islands of the West in disobedience to the laws of the gods resolved to conquer the whole earth. And thus it was that war came into being, for before th at time there had been no strife among men. And the seven kings led an army against the ancient Greeks and th ey invaded all of Europe, coming in great ships from t he west. This, Solon was told, occured about 9000 years before the seige of Troy. The gods were angry because the seven kings had mad e war. They caused the earth to be shaken and the great Islands of the West vanished into the sea . In a single night, sixty million human beings pe rished because they had disobeyed the laws of heaven. In time even the name of the Atlantic Empire was forgo tten; for it must ever be so that those who disobey the g ods shall vanish from the memory of mankind, regard less of their wealth or power. \"From these ancient columns\" said the High Priest, \"we have read the laws that were given in olden times for the government of nations. These laws ar e not made by men but are the will of Eternal Natur e. Upon these laws enduring States must be built. To depar t from these laws is to die. So perished the natio ns of the elder world.\" When Solon returned to Greece it was his intention to take the story of the Atlantic Empire and develo p it into a great epic poem; but the infirmity of ye ars and the responsibilities of the State interfere d. Instead, Solon told the story in the fullest detail to his c lose friend, Dropis, who in turn recited it to his son, Critias. In his 90th year, Critias communicated the narrative t o his grandson of the same name who later became a disciple of Socrates. It is in this way that the story of t he lost Atlantis came finally to be incorporated in the Platonic dialogues as part of a conversation between the you nger Critias and his master Socrates. The dialogue itself was named the Critias . "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 5 THE ANCIENT LEAGUE OF NATIONS A description of the lost Atlantis was written by P lato; it introduces the league formed by the ten b enevolent kings who ruled over the lesser nations and the three great continents of Eu rope, Asia, and Africa; and who bound themselves by oath to obey the divine laws of enduring empire.... This was the philosophic dem ocracy, with all men having the right to become wis e through self-discipline and self-improvement, thus achieving the only aristocra cy recognized by Natural Law. ... The Atlantis stor y continues to the later decision of the kings to use their united power to enslave a ll the peoples of the earth, and the consequent des truction of Atlantis by earthquake and fire ....interpreted politically, it is the sto ry of the breaking up of the ideal pattern of gover nment. T HE destruction of Atlantis, as described by Plato in the Critias, can be interpreted as a political fabl e. The tradition of the Lost Empire as descended from Solon was enlarged and embellished according to the formulas of the Orphic theology; but it does not fo llow necessarily that Plato intended to disparage t he idea that a lost continent had actually existed west of Europ e. Plato was a philosopher; he saw in the account of the fall of Atlantis an admirable opportunity to summarize h is convictions concerning government and politics. The Critias first describes the blessed state of the Atlantean people under the benevolent rulership of ten kings who were bound together in a league. These k ings were monarchs over seven islands and three gre at continents. From the fable we can infer that the t en rulers of the Atlantic league were philosopher k ings, endowed with all virtues and wise guardians of the public good. These kings obeyed the laws of the di vine father of their house, Poseidon, god of the seas. In the capital city of Atlantis stood the temple of Poseidon, and in it a golden figure of the god. I n this shrine also stood a column of precious substance in scribed with the laws of enduring empire. The ten kings took their oath together to obey these laws, and th ey chose one of their number, usually of the family of Atlas, to be the chief of their league. It was written on the column of the law that the te n kings of Atlantis should not take up arms against each other, for any reason. If one of them should break this law the other nine were to unite against him to preserve the peace. In all matters concerning the public good the ten k ings were to deliberate together, and each should b e mindful of the just needs of the others; for they w ere the members of one body and regents over the la nds of a blessed god. The kings had not the power of life or death over a ny of their subjects except with the consent of the majority of the ten; and each was responsible to t he whole league for his conduct in the administrati on of his own State. In this way Plato describes the government of the G olden Age, in which men live on earth according to the laws of heaven. By the three great continents of Atlantis are to be understood, Europe, Asia, and Africa; and by the seven islands, all the lesser peoples of the earth. The league of the ten kings is the cooperative co mmonwealth of mankind, the natural and proper form of human go vernment. The Atlantis, therefore, is the archetyp e or the pattern of right government, which existed in ancie nt days but was destroyed by the selfishness and ig norance of men. Plato, it must be remembered, was a monarchist by p hilosophic conviction, but his ideal king was the wise man perfect in the virtues and the natural rul er of those less informed than himself. This king was the father of his people, impersonal and unselfish, ded icated to the public good, a servant of both the go ds and his fellow men. This king was descended of a divine ra ce; that is, he belonged to the Order of the Illum ined; for those who come to a state of wisdom then belong to the family of the heroes--perfected human beings. Plato's monarchy was therefore a philosophic democr acy; for all men had the right to become wise through self-discipline and self-improvement. One who achieved this state was by virtue of his own ac tion a superior man, and this superiority was the only ari stocracy recognized by Natural Law. Competition is natural to the ignorant; and coopera tion is natural to the wise. Obeying the pattern established by the gods, the divine kings bound the mselves into the common league to obey its laws, pr eserve the peace, and punish any whose ambition might impe l them to tyranny or conquest. Here then, is a pattern of world government to insu re the prosperity of all peoples and activate the preservation of the peace."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Plato describes at some length the prosperity of th e Atlantic Isles under this benevolent rulership. The citizens were happy, and poverty was unknown. A wo rld trade was established, and the ships of the Atl antean marine traveled the seven seas, bringing rich treas ures to the motherland. There was little crime; th e arts flourished; and the sciences were cultivated in gre at universities. Men had no enemies, and war was u nknown. The god Poseidon guarded the destinies of his domai ns and favored the Atlantic Empire with a good climate and fertile soil. Men followed the occupations which they preferred a nd lived a communal existence, together sharing the fruits of their labors. It was Plato's convict ion that the human being was not created merely to engage in barter and exchange, but rather to perfect himself as the noblest of the animals, endowed with reason and the natural ruler of the material world. The Critias then describes the gradual change that came about in the course of the ages. In the beginning the Atlanteans saw clearly that their wea lth and prosperity increased as a result of friends hip. But gradually the divine portion of their consciousness began to fade away in them; their souls became dil uted with a mortal admixture and human nature gained ascenden cy. They became unseemly and lost those spiritual virtues which were the fairest of their precious gi fts. It is the story of how man departed from the perfec t pattern of his conduct, and in the end denied the very truths which were the foundations of his stren gth. With the loss of his spiritual perception, ma terial ambitions increased, and the desire for conquest wa s born. Men yearned after that which they had not earned, and gazed with covetous eyes upon the goods of othe rs. The rulers of the State were corrupted by the commo n evil; the ten kings were no longer friends; they no longer conferred together in the temple of Poseidon to decide all matters under the common oath. Thus was the great league dissolved by selfishness and ambition. It was then that war came into being, and with it tyranny and oppression, and despotism and the exploitation of peoples. At last the kings of Atlantis decided to use their common power to enslave all the peoples of the eart h. They gathered a vast army and attacked Europe from the sea, even going so far as to besiege the Atheni an States. And so they broke the law of the gods; fo r the twelve deities had so divided the earth that to each race and nation was given its proper part. Zeus, father of the gods, who carries in his hand t he thunderbolts of divine retribution, perceived th e evil of the time, and resolved to punish the arrogance o f the Atlanteans. But even Olympus is a commonweal th, and the other eleven gods were summoned to the council hall of the immortals. \"When all the gods had assembled in conference, Zeu s arose among them and addressed them thus--\" ... it is with this line that Plato's story of Atlantis ends; and the words of Zeus remain unknown. But the results of the conference are not left in d oubt. Zeus hurled his thunderbolts against the emp ire of the sea, shaking it with earthquakes and then de stroying it by horrible combustion. The only recor ds that remained were in vague traditions and two columns s et up under the temple at Sais. The destruction of Atlantis can be interpreted politically as the breaking up o f the ideal pattern of government. So complete was this destruction, that men forgot t here is a better way of life, and since have accept ed the evils of war and crime and poverty as inevitabl e. The world lost too all sense of its own unity; each man's hand was thereafter raised against his neighbor. T he perfect state disappeared under a deluge of poli tics; the priests of Poseidon gave way to the priesthood of M ammon. Plato's political vision was for the restoration of the Empire of the Golden Age. The old ways of the gods must be restored, he was convinced, if human b eings are to be preserved from the corruptions whic h they have brought upon themselves. Plato sought this en d when he established his university at Athens--the first school of formal education in history. Here men we re taught the great truths of religion, philosophy, science, and politics, to restore to them the vision of the perfect State. The old Atlantis was gone, dissolved in a sea of hu man doubts. But the philosophic empire would come again, as a democracy of wise men. Two thousand years later Lord Bacon re-stated this vision in his New Atlantis . "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 6 A ROMAN PROJECT TO GIVE RULERSHIP TO THE WISE The Platonic point of view was envisioned by Plotin us to take form as a philosophers' city, establishment of which was approved by his Roman emperor as the noblest experiment in t ime.... But the fear of the Roman Senators that the project ed commonwealth of learning might finally overthrow the empire brou ght the project to naught, as Rome continued in the advanced state of smugness that immediately preceded the complete collapse of the nation. D URING chess games played nearly seven hundred years afte r Plato's death, Plotinus, the greatest of the Neo-Platonists, discussed the problem of State with Galienus, Emperor of Rome. The Roman ruler was no t a profound thinker, but he had an excellent mind whic h inclined toward the Platonic point of view, and h e frequently sought advice from the great philosopher and mystic, Plotinus. This friendship led to Plot inus confiding to the emperor his dream of a philosophic city. The situation and circumstances were impressive. O ne of the two men had the vision of the world's greatest need, the other had the power to make that vision a reality. In the Compania, not far from Rome, stood the deser ted ruins of an ancient city which had been destroyed by the vandalism of men and the crumbling forces of time; Plotinus asked that this become t he site of a habitation for the learned, that here with fun ds raised from both public and private sources a no ble community be built, to be ruled over by the laws se t forth in the writings of Plato, and to honor the great man the city should be called Platonopolis. Plotinus pointed out that such a project would not only bring honor to the wise but would confer immortality upon the name of the emperor, lasting d ignity upon the whole of the Roman Empire. Galienu s came to favor the project as the noblest experiment in time. But the Roman Senate viewed the matter w ith suspicion and alarm. To them it would be a serious misfortune for the aristocracy of wealth to be cha llenged by the aristocracy of learning!--the philosophers' cit y might finally overthrow the Empire. Always, phil osophers had been especially troublesome to the smug, and Ro me was in the advanced state of smugness that immediately preceded the complete collapse of the e ntire Empire. So Galenius had to discover that emperors were not all-powerful; he was quietly informed by representatives of powerful and aristocratic famili es that if he continued to entertain seriously the dream of a philosopher's city it would be necessary to find as his successor a ruler with a more practical turn o f mind. Plotinus and the emperor continued to play chess an d conversationally build philosophic cities in the privacy of the royal apartments, and Rome continued on its hea dlong flight toward oblivion. Excepting only recent years, this is the one time i n history when a serious attempt was made to give wisdom a place in the temporal plan of living. Wis e men are naturally endowed with the qualities of r ulership, but they have had little if any voice in the rulers hip of the world; their voices have been heard onl y after the men themselves were dead. Plato lives thus today, and his words have a greater vitality in this centu ry than they did in his time in ancient Athens. An ever increasing thoughtfulness has resulted from the vicissitudes of recent years in bringing the realization that wars destroy not only the economic and political structures of nations, but the irrep laceable monuments of culture and learning which are the end uring wealth of empire. Great libraries are reduce d to smoldering rubble by the engines of modern warfare, the art treasures of five thousand years vanish in the smoke of battle, and ruthless pillaging and wanton mutilation are the inevitable accompaniment of mili tary aggressions. Both victor and vanquished are impove rished by a common loss, and posterity deprived of the noblest of its heritage. This need not go on. The remedial action required is no more than for men to set aside in some select ed part of the earth an area to be kept apart from all strife and struggle, and establish this as the com mon repository of the treasures of essential learning. On an isla nd distant from strategic military objectives could be built a city of art, libraries, museums, universities, laborator ies, and observatories. These institutions could b e united as one great structure, a school over all schools, the city to become the capital of the intellectual emp ire. It might appropriately be named Platonopolis, to honor the g reat man who first conceived the idea of the common wealth of learning."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"In times of stress or danger each nation could send to this community those of its citizens whose ment al excellence would entitle them to a world citizenshi p. Here, protected from all outside interference, they would be allowed to continue the various works of their i ndividual lives for the enrichment of their own tim e and future ages, their progressed knowledge becoming th e common property of all men, regardless of race or nation. It is safe to predict that such a philosophers' cit y would ultimately be the most practical and certai n instrument for accomplishing a world point of view in all departments of human thinking. The internat ional nation--the dream of the future which has been insp ired by the terror of modern warfare--would have it s natural beginning in a union of superior intellects. Art k nows no race; music is a common denominator; biol ogy and physics are served by explorers into the furthermos t and innermost secrets of nature. When we recogni ze that the poet, the scholar, and the savant are indeed a race inhabiting the suburbs of a superior world, th at they are the noblest of our creatures, we can know that we h onor ourselves most by honoring them. Here lies the solution to the great educational ref orm so necessary at this time. We can not hope to build a nobility of man upon the sterility of a nar row, competitive, materialistic educational policy. The ignorance of man has been his undoing. Only wisdom can restore him to his divine estate. The religious motion in the modern world is away fr om theology and all the artificial limitations set up by creeds and dogmas. To meet the ever increasing dissatisfaction, there must be a new vision concern ing the substance of spiritual truth. The religion of the future will include within its own structure the be st of science, art, literature, politics, and sociology. Spiritua lity is not a blind faith about things invisible. It is an inspired use of things known and available. That man is religio us who lives well. That man is sacrilegious who pe rverts universal good for purposes of private gain. The a bstract parts of religion are useful only to the de gree that they justify and prove the moral virtues. From the broad gates of the philosophers' city coul d flow the inspiration for a completely new estimation of the Universe, and man's relationship to it. When the gentler parts of learning exercise dominion over the human mind, world peace will be more than the substance of things hoped for. The Roman Senate now lies in its snug little tomb a long the Appian Way. But unfortunately the temper of the Roman Senator still survives to oppose the u nknown and defend private privilege against the wor ld's necessity. And for this reason it may be as diffic ult to found the philosopher's city on the ruin of modern civilization as it was to build Platonopolis on the ruins of the old city of the Compania. There is one difference, however. In the last 1800 years humanity has suffered its way a little neare r to a state of enlightenment. We are a little older an d a little wiser than the Roman Senate. Education and science are lodged in institutions far stronger than in tha t day when wandering teachers held classes on doors teps or along the country road. In every nation of the civ ilized world great institutions of learning have sp rung up, richly endowed and fully equipped to meet the chall enge of a new age. What these institutions lack is common spirit and common purpose, and an ideal strong enou gh to bind them into one great empire of learning. When Plato dreamed of his wise man's world he set t he chief place in it aside to be the temple of the Ever Living God. Here he proposed to set up once m ore the column of precious substance bearing upon i t the laws of the immortals for the conduct of human affa irs. To this shrine the learned would come again, to bind themselves with the great oath that they should dwe ll at peace each with the other, and serve all men, justly and without favor. This oath is the beginning of learning and the end of strife.

The Creek Dionys ians were social and political temple builders, known as the Collegians in later Rome. ... The rise of the Christian Church brought persecution of the classical intellectual p attern's ideology, driving the guilds into greater secrecy; but all h ave continued searching for human happiness under a variety of ri tuals and symbols; and they still exist, as the Order of the Quest. T ODAY'S thinking toward a democratic world state is neithe r a new trend nor an accidental circumstance; the work of setting up the backgroun d of knowledge necessary to the establishing of enl ightened democracy among all nations has been carried on for many hundreds of years by secret societies. Secret societies have existed among all peoples, sa vage and civilized, since the beginning of recorded history. The esoteric organizations of ancient tim es were for the most part religious and philosophic al. In the medieval world they were philosophical and politica l. In the modern world, political and social. Secret societies have had concealment and protectio n as the first purpose for their existence. The members of these orders were party to some special knowledge, they usually took part in certain rites and rituals not available to non-members, but it was mo re important that through the societies they were a lso able to practice beliefs and doctrines in private for which they would have been condemned and persecuted if t hese rites were made public. A second purpose for secret societies was to create a mechanism for the perpetuation from generation t o generation of policies, principles, or systems of l earning, confined to a limited group of selected an d initiated persons. Primitive secret orders exist among African tribes, among the Eskimo, and throughout the East Indies and Northern Asia. The American Indian, the Chines e, Hindus, and Arabs have elaborate religious and fraternal organizations. In most cases these secre t orders are benevolent and the members are bound t ogether by obligations of mutual helpfulness and the servic e of the public good. It is beyond question that t he secret societies of all ages have exercised a considerable degree of political influence, usually directed ag ainst despotism, intolerance, and religious fanaticism. The Order of the Dionysian Artificers originated am ong the Greeks and Syrians at some remote time before 1500 B.C. It was composed originally of ski lled craftsmen, banded together in a guild to perpe tuate the secrets of their crafts. Gradually the science of architecture took precedence and dominated the poli cies of the society. According to legend, when Solomon, King o f Israel, resolved to build his temple according to the will of his father, David, he sent to Tyre and engaged t he services of a cunning workman, Hiram Abiff, a ma ster of the Dionysian Artificers. The members of this soci ety held the exclusive right throughout the Greek s tates of designing the temples of the gods, the houses of go vernment, the theaters of Dionysius and the buildin gs used for the public games. It is certain that the Dionysians practiced secret rites and worshipped the gods under geometric symbolism; and that they possessed a body of lore w hich included mathematical secrets of proportion an d design, certain knowledge concerning universal dyna mics, and a philosophical, religious, moral and pol itical conviction concerning the perfecting of human socie ty. They referred to ignorant and uncultured human s as a rough ashlar, that is, an uncut stone as it comes f rom the quarry, unsuited to the purposes of buildin g. Through the refinement which resulted from self-discipline and an addiction to the divine arts, man perfected himself; becoming square, upright, and true, thus forming th e true ashlar, or the cut stone which could fit wit h others into a pattern of masonry. In their secret work th e Dionysians thus were social and political temple builders, and the temple upon which they labored was the livi ng temple of the Living God, \"built of stone made r eady before it was brought thither; so that there was n either hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house while it was in the building.\" This temple was hum an society perfected; and each enlightened and per fected human being was a true stone for its building. As Grecian culture reached Rome, the Latins formed their own Dionysian society and named it the Collegia. The greatest of the Collegians was an ar chitect, Vitruvius, sometimes called the father of modern"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"architecture. A man of vast learning, he was respo nsible for the superior sanitation of Rome and the great aqueducts which still border the Appian Way. While the Collegia of the Romans was less philosophical than was the Grecian society, because of the different t emper of the Latin people, it exercised considerabl e social power and perpetuated the substance of the old beli ef. The rise of the Christian Church broke up the intel lectual pattern of the classical pagan world. By persecution of this pattern's ideologies it drove t he secret societies into greater secrecy; the paga n intellectuals then reclothed their original ideas in a garment of Christian phraseology, but bestowed the keys of th e symbolism only upon those duly initiated and bound to secrecy by their vows. Part of the Dionysian movement migrated eastward to build the empire of Islam with each stone in mosque and palace bearing the mark of the master ma sons. Later the migration continued as far as Indi a, where these same marks are to be seen on the monuments of the Mogul dynasty. In early development of Europe the Dionysians becam e the guild of the cathedral builders. They signed each stone with the secret symbols of their cult, a nd into the intricate carvings of church and chapel they worked the old pagan figures and designs. Many gui lds sprang up, binding skilled craftsmen in confrat ernities of arts and crafts and trades. Architecture remain ed the chosen instrument for the perpetuation of th e Great Design--the building of the perfect world. All the sciences contained brilliant far-seeing men who equally desired to contribute their part to th e philosophic empire of the future. Secret societies were formed in their own professions, using the em blems established in their arts to conceal their social a spirations. Thus did the Alchemists come into bein g, the mystic chemists seeking the elixir of life, the wise man's stone, the universal medicine, and the agent for t he transmutation of metals. The elixir of life is truth itself, the preserver o f all things. The wise man's stone is science, that can work all wonders and solve all riddles of the mortal sphere. The universal medicine is wisdom, the only cure for ignorance, which is the universal disease. The agent for the transmutation of metals is the pa ttern of the Universal State, the essence of the pe rfect plan for a world civilization by which all the base elements in human society can be transmuted into t he spiritual gold of right purpose. In Italy, the Illuminati sought for the pearl of gr eat price hidden in the deep waters of mortal corru ption. In northern Europe, the Knights of the Holy Grail d edicated their lives to the search for the chalice of the passion. Christian and Jewish cabalists pondered the letters of the scriptures to find the secret of the crown of splendors, and the Rosicrucians in their hidden hou ses used the Rose of Sharon as the symbol of brothe rly love, a simple rearrangement of the letters r-o-s-e becom ing e-r-o-s, the Greek God of love, Eros. All these groups belong to what is called The Order of the Quest. All were searching for one and the same thing under a variety of rituals and symbols. That one thing was a perfected social order, Plato 's commonwealth, the government of the philosopher-kin g. To this end each consecrated its life and knowl edge, exploring ever further into the secrets of Nature t o discover the greatest secret of all--the secret o f human happiness. We are indebted to these Brothers of the Quest for our sciences, arts, and crafts of today. They were the discoverers; they were the astronomers, scientists , physicians, mathematicians, and artists whose wor ks we treasure but whose dreams we have ignored. They ga ve knowledge to the world to make men happy. We ha ve used their knowledge to make a few men rich. We ha ve perverted their skill, desecrated their dreams, and profaned their mysticism. But the knowledge they h ave given us is available to be used in a nobler wa y, and some day we shall awaken to our responsibility with the realization that it is our common duty to rest ore the dignity of learning and dedicate unselfishly to the human need. About the middle of the 17th Century, Sir Elias Ash mole, patron of the liberal arts and founder of the Ashmolian Museum at Oxford, was initiated into the guild of the operative freemasons of London, the fi rst non- craftsman to be permitted membership. From that ti me on, the entire pattern of the guilds was changed , and speculative masonry came to dominate the older form of the craft, and the intellect builder came into his own. One veil of the old symbolism was lifted, to reveal in full clarity that the guilds were dedicated to a program social and political. In this way the old dream of the philosophic empire descended from the ancient world to modern time. Secret societies still exist, and regardless of the intemperance of the times, they will continue to f lourish until the Quest is complete."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"For more than three thousand years, secret societie s have labored to create the background of knowledg e necessary to the establishment of an enlightened de mocracy among the nations of the world.

It was from a Greek port that he sailed on the cele brated voyage of discovery. He was accompanied by a mysterious stranger, which has suggested that Columbus was an agent of the society of unknow n philosophers. ... The pattern of the democratic ideal was beginning t o assert itself over the tyranny of decadent aristo cracy. A new world was necessary for a new idea. ... When it was necessary, it was discovered. N OTE : The University of Barcelona has pronounced genui ne a document discovered by an Italian archeologist in 1929. It records that the treasurer of Spain counseled Colon to repr esent himself as Christophorens in demanding aid fr om the King of Spain, and states emphatically that Admiral Colon was not the same man as Christophoro Colombo, son of Dominico a nd Susana Fontanarossa who lived in Genoa. A S stated earlier, there can be little doubt that the Greeks were aware of the existence of the American continent long before the beginning of the Christia n era. If information is not general on that point , it is equally surprising how little is known about the man Christ opher Columbus who is accredited with the discovery of the new world. The date of his birth is unrecorded, an d twenty cities claim Columbus as a native. So man y legends have sprung up about this strange man that it is difficult to distinguish fact from fancy. In 1937 a little book was published, entitled, Christopher Columbus Was A Greek . According to its author, Spyros Cateras, the real name of Columbus w as Prince Nikolaos Ypsilantis, and he came from the Greek Island of Chios. The statement is backed by quotations from numerous early historians and State documents. The author of this little book has documented his o pinions in a manner to bring joy to the critical reader. He mentions the following Greeks who navig ated the Atlantic ocean in ancient times: Hercules , Odyssus, Colaeus, Pytheus, and Eratosthenes. He po ints out that the language of the ancient Mayas of the American continent contains many words of pure Gree k belonging to the Homeric period, and, to quote th e book: \"Years ago, in the republic of Uruguay, Sout h America, were discovered traces of the army of Al exander the Great, swords and thoras with the inscription ' PTOLEMEOS ALEXANDROY '!\"."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"All modern research on the life of Columbus tends t o prove that he was not a man of humble station, poor or uneducated, and the story of Queen Isabella and her jewels is rapidly becoming recognizable as fiction. Columbus is emerging as a man of impressive persona lity with marked abilities as a leader and organize r and an excellent classical education. Like most Greeks of his time he admired the writing s of Plato and the other classical philosophers; h e had the Greek birthright of legend and tradition, a nd was mentally well suited for interpretation of c lassical lore. There is much to indicate that Columbus was inspired for his voyages by Plato's account of the lost Atlantis and the records of early navigation to the West. Furthermore, Europe was not without some knowledge of geography and in his day there were ma ny scholars aware of the spherical form of the eart h. A great trade with Asia had long passed over the ca ravan routes of the Near East, as the Arabs for the most part were a friendly people; but with the rise of the Turkish Empire to power most of these route s were closed to the infidel. When even the Crusades fail ed to keep clear the roads of commerce, it became e ver more desirable to discover a western passage to the Orie nt. It was for this purpose that Columbus sailed, and not from an Italian or Spanish port, but from the Greek port of Mahon. It is astonishing how difficult it is to ascertain the facts about the celebrated voyage of discovery and the life of one so prominent in history as Christopher Columbus; it appears that history entered into a c onspiracy to conceal the truth. Possibly an elaborate misrepres entation was intentional, for certainly the confusi on began before the death of Columbus. His own son refers t o his father as a Greek. It has been suggested tha t Columbus changed his name because of religious or p olitical pressure, but this is in the field of conj ecture. Then too, in browsing about among old records I hav e run across a dim figure involved in the life of Columbus, a strange man who seems to have served th e explorer in die capacity of counselor. Nothing v ery tangible has as yet come to light, but it is hinted that this mysterious person accompanied Columbus o n his first voyage. He was not included in the list of the mar iners. He did not return, but remained in the West Indies; beyond this, no further mention is made of him. This mysterious stranger is reminiscent of the blac k-robed man who guided the destiny of Mohammed. Were these obscure figures ambassadors of the secre t government?--Columbus being one of the agents thr ough which the society of unknown philosophers accomplis hed its purposes ? It is my opinion that he was such an agent. The si gnature of Columbus, composed of letters curiously arranged and combined with cabalistic designs, cert ainly conveys far more than is inherent in the sign ature of a private citizen. The importance of Columbus in the larger scheme of things is to be estimated from his relationship to the pattern of his own time. Europe, passing from the obscuration of the medieval period, was coming into the light of the modern way of life; the motion of the Renaissance had spread like ever widening ripples over the surface of a stagnant pool. Printing had been disc overed; the mental emancipation of man from the ty ranny of ignorance, superstition, and fear was gradually bei ng accomplished. The democratic ideal was beginnin g to assert itself over the tyranny of decadent aristocr acy. As the mental horizon broadened, the physical horiz on extended also. The Crusades had broken up the structure of feudalism. Principalities were formin g themselves into nations, and the tribal conscious ness was disappearing from the theater of European politics. This progress was opposed at each step by vested interests. But the human mind was becoming aware of its own po wers, in a motion of continuing irresistible force. A new world was necessary for a new idea. When it was necessary it was discovered. That which is needed is always near if man has the wit to find it . Today we are again seeking for a new world. No lon ger do there remain undiscovered continents to serve us as laboratories for social experiments, so we are turning our attention to other kinds of wor lds--worlds of thought, inner spheres which must yet be explore d by daring navigators. Science in the last fifty years has discovered a new universe--the universe of the mind . The infant psychology has but to come of age for us to fully discover a new sphere for new exploration in the science of living. The voyages of Columbus were followed by two centur ies of enlarging our geographic knowledge of the earth. Explorers who sailed the seven seas see king wealth, brought home knowledge; it released h uman thought from its Mediterranean fixation and accompl ished the still greater end of breaking the power o f a Mediterranean theology and a Mediterranean way of l ife. Men began to think world thoughts, began to r ealize that while the whole earth was one land divided int o continents and oceans it still was a gigantic uni ty. Out of the global wanderings of stout sea captains in litt le wooden ships was developed our so-called global thinking of today."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The concept of a global world, at least in terms of geography, is now our common inheritance.

"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 9 THE PROPHECIES OF NOSTRADAMUS Eleven years after Columbus reached our shores, an extraordinary man was born in France. In adult life he was both a respected physician and a mystic who was able to write accurately the history of the world to com e. ... There was no indication at the time that in the Western Hemisphere would arise a great nation, but Dr. Michel Nostradamus saw a civilization estab lished there that would observe (always on a Thursday) a day to express thanksgiving for freedom of religion, freedom of opportunity, an d freedom of life. ... He prophesied that this nation would free itself fr om the bonds of the mother country, would greatly prosper, but would have to fight seve ral wars--one with the Orient-- before becoming a great power in a pattern of world peace, with other nations looking to it for leadership. .. . All that he foretold is precisely according to the Platonic tradition. H ISTORIES are generally written about the men who prominentl y influence the events that make history; little is written--though it might be of greater interest--about those shadowy figures who s eem always to stand behind the men who make history. Michel Nostradamus, seer of France, is among the mo st extraordinary of such men; born in 1503, and possessed of some inner source of knowledge beyond the reach of ordinary mortals, he wrote the history of the world to come ! Two hundred years later, the celebrated Illuminist and Rosicrucian, the Comte de St. Germain, remarked to his close friend, Prince Carl of Hesse-Cassel, t hat he was the one who had assisted Nostradamus in the calculation of his remarkable predictions. All this is far too shadowy for sober historians, a lthough a number have spent considerable time and developed numerous headaches trying to trace the li fe of the illusive Comte, who was called by Frederi ck the Great, \"The man who does not die.\" Nostradamus was a respected physician, a man of out standing medical accomplishments. Few details of his life are available, but from the context of his manuscripts, his epistles to the King of France, a nd his letters to his own son, it is evident that he too belonged to the Order of the Quest. Mystic, philosopher, as trologer, alchemist, and cabalist, Nostradamus was versed in all the secret lore disclosed only to those who hav e bound themselves with the oath of the brotherhood. The prophecies of Nostradamus might have come entir ely as revelations of the spirit; but it is equall y possible that in his quaint old doggerel verses he included part of the plan of things to come as alre ady well set in the minds and purposes of his brother initiates. The first edition of the Prophecies of Nostradamus was published in 1660. At that time the Americas were still the happy hunting ground of Spanish adve nturers. There was no indication that in the Weste rn Hemisphere would arise a great nation. Yet Nostrad amus writes at sufficient length of the future stat e of America to indicate an extraordinary knowledge. The old seer refers to this country under several n ames. He calls it the Hisparides, the Blessed Isle s of the West. In another place he simply names it Amer ica. And his third designation of it is, the Land Which Keeps the Thursday. This last form is the most astonishing. For it ref ers to the unique American holiday, Thanksgiving, which always falls upon a Thursday. And this the o nly holiday which depends upon the day alone for it s observance, and is peculiarly the American holiday which expresses thankfulness for freedom of religio n, freedom of opportunity, and freedom of life. To summarize the opinions of Nostradamus concerning the future destiny of Western civilization is difficult, because of the involved idiom of the ori ginal text. But he points out clearly certain thin gs that will happen. He saw that a great civilization would ris e in the western world. This civilization would fr ee itself from the bonds to its mother country, and then assu me a free place among the temporal powers. The new country would flourish and extend its domain across the entire continent. It would grow rich and powe rful, he predicted, and live at peace with its sister, (Cana da). He said that America would have to fight seve ral wars,"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"including one with the Orient. This conflict he de scribes as an eagle flying against the rising sun, and in his day neither the eagle nor the rising sun had significan ce of the slightest importance in the symbolism of nations. Fulfilling its destiny, Nostradamus foretold that A merica would become a great power in a pattern of world peace and would be looked up to by other nati ons for leadership against the common evils of the time. In short, as Nostradamus foretells the story of the Bl essed Isles it is precisely according to the Platon ic tradition; and we can not but wonder if he was a party to that tradition, and knew exactly whereof he spoke. Whether the 16th Century physician of France had hi s visions from within himself, or whether he merely wrote down what was given to him by another, we can never know. Conventional thinkers, doubtin g such prophetic powers, incline toward the second al ternative. And that will leave them scarcely less comfortable of mind, for the existence of this secr et brotherhood plan is then virtually admitted. Nostradamus is not the only prophet who sensed or k new the future of western empire. There was Dr. Ebenezar Sibly, who flourished in England about the close of the 18th Century. It is reported that Si bly had a shrewish wife and it was to escape her tongue that he retired to a garret of his house to ponder the m ysteries of the Universe, his meals being passed to him through a hole in the door. Dr. Sibly divided his time be tween an infallible elixir which, if dissolved in wine, woul d dissolve all human ills, and the writing of long books dealing with astrology, physiology, and anatomy. In his day, the American republic was in its infanc y; and brilliant politicians on the floor of the Ho use of Commons were predicting that the rebellious colonie s would soon be begging on bended knee to be restor ed to the British commonwealth. Sibly, though a stout Br itisher, expressed his regrets that he had to point out that, in one detail at least, an astrologer in his garret wo uld prove wiser than the best politicians in Europe , for sad to relate, the American colonies would not come home-- the stars decreed otherwise. Not only would they r emain outside the fold, he said, but they would grow rich and powerful; extending themselves across their c ontinent, Americans would build great cities and develop worl d trade and industry. And, one day--horrible thoug ht!-- they would be stronger than the mother country ! A nd this was the truth that must be spoken, if only through a hole in a garret door. It should be remembered that among the ancients, as trology was one of the sciences of government. The prognostic aspect of the subject was not the ma in interest in the minds of such men as Pythagoras and Plato; these philosophers saw in the motion of the heavenly bodies and the order of the cosmos a grea t pattern of natural laws. The Universe was a celestial empi re populated with planets, and suns, and moons, in a heavenly arrangement which was a clue to the proper distribution of human affairs. The State, they ad vocated, should be patterned after the Cosmos. Governments of men should be in harmony with the larger governm ent of the world. Many old astrological books indicate clearly that p lanetary symbols were used to represent the element s of a political system, and that the astrologers the mselves were part of the Order of the Quest. Benea th the cloak of professional astrologers, they were counselors a dvising kings and princes to establish better laws and rule their peoples more wisely. Nostradamus was consulted by three kings. Europe's most powerful Queen, Catherine de Medici, also consulted him on numerous occasions. His advice wa s always temperate and directed toward the public g ood. His scholarship gave a perspective on political pro blems that was beyond the scope of the professions of statescraft. All the petty princes of Europe in medieval times h ad their Merlins, wise old men who in many instances were the actual rulers of the State. It is obvious that if these counselors Were bound toge ther by some common purpose their collective power would be cons iderable. And they were bound together, in the sec ret society of unknown philosophers, moving the crowns of Europe as on a mighty chess board. Men of this calibre bring about the mutations of empire. It is the general opinion that revolutions begin with th e common people, but this is not true; the benevolently inf ormed always guide and direct public opinion. Through the centuries the prophesies of Nostradamus have continued to exercise a powerful force on the political destiny of the world. They have been tra nslated into most of the languages of Europe; they were frequently quoted and reprinted during the period o f the First World War; and in the Second World War both the Axis and the Allied powers have quoted Nostrada mus variously to serve their purposes. It is in the larger picture of the world's future t hat Nostradamus indicates the coming of the great l eague, or assembly of world powers. This league is to be the only human hope of peace, the only solution to a competition between nations. The formation of this league begins the new life of the human race, will allow the human being at last to emerge into the estate f or which he was fashioned."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Barbarism ends with the beginning of world civiliza tion. To be civilized, according to Cicero, is to reach that state of personal and collective behavio r in which men can live together harmoniously and constructively, united for the betterment of all. By this definition, we have never been civilized. We have existed in a state of cultured savagery. The promise of Nostradamus is especially meaningful in these difficult years; for he assures us that t he commonwealth of nations is to become a reality. The men who through the centuries have envisioned U topia belong to ages yet unborn, when the principle s of natural philosophy will be applied to the prob lems of government and social dilemmas will be examined for solutions which are now termed impractical "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 10 THE DESIGN OF UTOPIAS Sir Thomas More wrote a fable, about four hundred y ears ago, to set forth the social state of man in a philosophic commonwealth, but so completely ha s the world missed the entire point, that the very word \"Utopia\" is even today a synonym for optimistic but impractical ideals of reform. ... Campenella, a n Italian philosopher, wrote of the major tragedy in that the subject of s tatesmanship alone had been neglected as practically every other subject had been reduced to a science. Government officials, he insisted, should be electe d after examination to determine knowledge and fitness .... Boccalini contributed fu rther to Utopian literature, and Andreae sought to Christianize it, with the the me: \"For lack of vision the people perish.\" O NE of the best known and least read of the world's li terary productions is Sir Thomas More's Utopia . It was composed by a man who had suffered greatly f rom the political corruption of his day, 1478-1535; having held high office, More was well acquainted with tho se machinations commonly called conspiracies of the State. More should properly be regarded as a Platonist, to o; for the entire framework for the Utopia is borrowed from Plato's Republic , and the book is permeated throughout with Platoni c ideology concerning the ideal State. Under a thinly veiled satire attackin g the policies of King Henry VIII, here then is ano ther voice calling men to the correction of their political vi ces. Unfortunately, the immediate success of More's book was due to his attack on the King and the government in general, rather than any serious cons iderations of the remedies which he suggested. In the Utopia , More presents his philosophical and political con viction in the form of a fable which sets forth the social state of man in a philosophic comm onwealth. So completely has the world missed the e ntire point that More attempted to emphasize, that the ve ry word \"Utopia\" has become a synonym for optimisti c but impractical ideals of reform. Sir Thomas More was centuries in advance of his day , which was reason enough why he could not be appreciated. Together with the master, Plato, More belongs to ages yet unborn, to the time when men w eary of study of the dilemmas which now they examine by wha t they think is practical, will turn to solutions w hich they now term impractical. An important Utopian was Tommaso Campenella, 1568-1 639, an Italian philosopher also with strong Platonic leanings. Out of the wisdom of his years, Campenella composed the Civitas Solis, the city of the sun. In this work he departed from his usual interests-- science, mathematics, and religion--to apply the pr inciples of natural philosophy to the problems of government. He regarded it as a major tragedy that men had redu ced to a science practically every branch of learning except statesmanship, which continued to be left to the v agaries of incompetent politicians skilled only in the arts of avarice. Unfortunately, Campenella was not able to free his mind entirely from the pattern of his contemporary world, so his ideals are confused and not entirely consistent. He viewed government as a kind of nece ssary evil to be endured until each man shall become self-gove rning in his own right. To the degree that the ind ividual is incapable of the practice of the moral virtues, he must be subjected to the laws which protect him fro m himself and protect others from his unwise actions. The pr incipal purpose of life then is to release oneself from the domination of government by the perfection of perso nal character. Campenella envisioned the perfect State as a kind o f communistic commonwealth in which men shared all the properties of the State, receiving more or less according to the merit of each one's action. His theory that the State should control propagation is a little di fficult in application, but his advice that all men should receive military training as part of their education would meet present favor. Government officials, he insis ted, should be elected by an examination to determine knowledge and fitness, and promotion should be by merit alon e and without political interference. This view is defin itely Platonic, and leads naturally to Plato's conc eption of the philosopher-king as the proper ruler over his peopl e. Campenella may have intended his City of the Sun to be a philosophic vision of a proper world government, or may have been setting forth no more than the basis for a new constitution for the City of Naples, which at that time was looking forward to t he estate of a free city. It is also said of Campe nella that he lacked the beauty and idealism of the greater Plato nists, and while this is probably true, his book is witness to the ills of his own time and a reminder to us that most of the evils he pointed out remain uncorrected ."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"In the year 1613, Trajano Boccalini, aged seventyse ven, was strangled to death in his bed by hired assassins. At least this is one account. We are i nformed by another historian that he died of colic. A third describes his demise as a result of being slugged w ith sand bags. Anyhow, he died. And it is believe d that Trajano's end was due to a book which he published entitled, Ragguagli di Parnaso , a witty exposition of the foibles of his time. The 77th section of this book is titled, \"A General Reformation of the World.\" Like the other Utopian s, Boccalini made use of a fable to point out politica l evils and their corrections: Apollo, the god of light and truth, is dismayed by the increasing number of suic ides occurring among men. So he appoints a committ ee composed of the wisest philosophers of all time to examine into the state of the human race. These me n bring a detailed account and numerous recommendations to Ap ollo. Nearly every evil of modern government is included, ranging from protective tariffs to usury in private debt. The final conclusion reached by t he committee is that the human problem is unsolvable e xcept through a long process involving suffering an d disaster. As an immediate remedy the best that cou ld be done was to regulate the price of cabbages--w hich seemed to be the only article not defended by an ad equate force of public opinion or a large enough lo bby in places of power. Boccalini's satire is important because it constitu ted the first published statement of the Society of the Rosicrucians. It points out that, first, evils mus t be recognized; then, the public must be educated to assume its proper responsibility in the correction of these ev ils; and lastly, public opinion must force the ref ormation of the State and curb the ambitions of politicians. T his was a solemn pronouncement in the opening years of the 17th Century. It is little wonder that it cost Boc calini his life. Johann Valentin Andreae, an early 17th Century Germ an Lutheran theologian, was the next to cast his lot with the Utopians. Andreae's status is difficu lt to define, but he is generally believed to be at least the editor of the great Rosicrucian Manifestos , and the author of the Chemical Marriage of Christian Rosencreutz . We may therefore safely assume that he was connected w ith one of the great orders of the Quest. Andreae's contribution to the Utopian literature is his Christianopolis , or the City of Christ. This work, which is almost unknown to English readers, is larg ely developed from the ideas of Plotinus. Christianopolis is Platonopolis, Christianized. Its author was a quie t scholar with a long white beard and a strict sens e of Lutheran propriety. His Christianopolis is a monument of morality and good taste, but bene ath his strict orthodoxy, Andreae was a man of broad vision. His city is governed by the wise and is enriched with a ll the arts and sciences; there is no poverty. The citiz ens are happy because each is performing his task m otivated by an understanding of the dignity of human life. To my mind, it is dignity of values that makes Christianopolis a great book. In order to live wisely, men must have a sense of participation in the prese nt good and future good. There must be a reason fo r living. There must be a purpose understandable to all, vita l enough and noble enough to be the object of a com mon consecration. Andreae tells us again and again, in the quaint wording of his old book, \"For lack of v ision the people perish.\" It remained for the master of all fable, Sir Franci s Bacon, to bind together the vision of the Utopias with supreme artistry. It is a philosophical catastroph e that Bacon's New Atlantis was left unfinished. Or was it left unfinished ? Rumor has it that the book was actual ly completed but was never published in full form b ecause it told too much. The final sections of Bacon's fable are said to have revealed the entire pattern of th e secret societies which had been working for thousands of y ears to achieve the ideal commonwealth in the polit ical world. I have examined two old manuscripts relating to thi s subject and found them most provocative; but it might be less to the point to discuss that which Lo rd Bacon was compelled to conceal, when there is so much that is worthy of our consideration in the parts of the work actually published."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 11 THE OBJECTIVE OF THE SECRET SOCIETY One reference to a secret society in Bacon's New Atlantis is scarcely less than a proclamation of the Society of Unknown philosophers, but has gon e unnoticed for three hundred years. ... This fable is of the land of Bensalem, meaning the Son of Peace, which with its merchandise, the Light of Truth, maintained a trade with Atlanti s, which was declared to be the same as America. ... Every thing indicates that it was S ir Francis Bacon's dream that the enlarging of the bounds of human empire sh ould be instituted on our own continent, an area peculiarly set aside by Nature for the perf ection of philosophy and the sciences. T HE writings of Sir Francis Bacon are generally groupe d under three headings--professional, literary, and philosophical. Each of these groups contains a variety of important works. But Lord Bacon's mind , taste, and conviction are best revealed through his philos ophical writings. In this group are works that are strictly philosophical, others that verge toward the science s, and still others which sum up convictions relati ng to all branches of knowledge. Possibly the most remarkable of Lord Bacon's ethica l contributions is the fragment called the New Atlantis , which forms a kind of gloss upon his principal ph ilosophical production, the Instauratio Magna . To Bacon, the greater part of learning was the applica tion of knowledge to the necessities of the human s tate. It was only natural that he should envision the result s should his inductive system be given Universal ap plication. The New Atlantis was first published in 1627, as a kind of appendix to the Sylva Sylvarum , a natural history in ten centuries. On the title page is a c urious design. It shows the figure of an ancient c reature representing Time drawing a female figure from a da rk cavern. The meaning is obvious: Through time, t he hidden truth shall be revealed. This figure is one of the most famous of the seals or symbols of the Order of the Quest. Contained within it is the whole promise of the resurrection of man, and the restitution of th e divine theology. The New Atlantis was not published during the recorded lifetime of Lord Bacon. It was issued the year following his death by His Lordship's chaplain, Wil liam Rawley. This man was Bacon's close friend and familiar over a period of many years, and most of B acon's papers were entrusted to Rawley's care. In his admiration for Bacon's personal character and philo sophical powers he left the expressed wish to be bu ried at his master's feet, and his wish was fulfilled. Rawley writes in his introduction to Bacon's the New Atlantis , \"This fable My Lord devised, to the end that he might exhibit therein, a model or descripti on of a college, instituted for the interpreting of nature, and the producing of great and marvelous works, for the benefit of men; under the name of Solomon's house, or the college of the six days work.\" The college of the six days work is, of course, a t hinly veiled reference to the perfection of nature through art. The six days are the days of creation by which the natural world was brought into existe nce, according to the account given in Genesis. As God created the Universe in six symbolic days, so man b y art-- that is, philosophy--must create the condition of h is own perfection by means of six philosophical ste ps. The college is the secret school--the wise man's 'h ouse' wherein are taught all arts and sciences, and not according to a materialistic interpretation, but ac cording to a divine understanding of causes. Rawley stated that it had been His Lordship's inten tion to complete the fable of the New Atlantis with a second part, to contain the laws of the Ideal State , or commonwealth of the wise. Since it was Bacon' s custom to prepare numerous drafts of his writings in the p rocess of perfecting them, it is probable that the second part existed at least in outline; but Rawley would not have felt it proper to publish the part which His L ordship had not perfected in literary form. It is well known among the secret societies of Euro pe that the second part of the New Atlantis exists. It includes a description of a great room in Solomon's house wherein are displayed the crests and the coa ts of arms of the governors of the philosophic empire. I t may be for this reason that the writings were sup pressed, for these crests and arms belonged to real persons who might have been subjected to persecution, as Si r Walter Raleigh was, if their association with the secret o rder had been openly announced. The fable of the New Atlantis begins with a ship sailing from Peru for China and Japan being driven from its course by contrary winds. Those aboard af ter many months faced death by starvation and disea se. They prayed to God for help, and their prayer was a nswered; the ship came at last to the fair harbor of a great"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"city in an unknown land. Here the mariners were ho spitably received and after certain formalities wer e permitted to land; and the wonders of the city wer e then revealed to them. The title page of Bacon's masterpiece, Novum Organum , features a small sailing ship between two columns. These columns are the pillars of Hercules , the Strait of Gibraltar, which marked the western boundary of the sea. The little ship is science, sailing fo rth from the limits and boundaries of the old world into the unknown sea of Universal learning. Is not this the same ship that finally came to haven in the Wise M an's City ? The New Atlantis describes the magnificence of the college of the s ix days work. Here the wise dwelt together in a gentle commonwealth of learning. One of the wise men makes the following statement in a prayer: \"Lord God of Heaven and Earth; Thou hast vouchsafe d of Thy grace to those of our Order , to know Thy works of creation, and the secrets of them; and to discern (as far as appertai neth to the generations of men) between divine mira cles, works of nature, works of art, and impostures and illusions of all sorts.\" It is difficult to understand how this reference to a secret order has passed unnoticed for so long, f or it is scarcely less than a proclamation of the Society of Unknown Philosophers. The name of the land in which stood the Wise Man's City was Bensalem; this means the Son of Peace. Bensalem maintained a trade with all parts of the w orld, but not for gold, silver, jewels, silks, spic es, nor any other material commodity; its merchandise was the Light of Truth. Among the nations traded with was Atlantis, which was declared to be the same as Amer ica. The college of Solomon's house had ambassadors, age nts, and representatives among all the nations of the world, so that all discoveries in the arts and sciences might be known to it. In great libraries all useful records were stored up for the service of future ag es. The book closes with a long lecture delivered by on e of the Fathers of Solomon's house. This great dignitary summarized the work of the brotherhood in the following magnificent statement--one which mig ht well be inscribed over the doors of learning and in the hearts of all scholars, scientists, and philos ophers: \"The end of our foundation is the knowledge of caus es, and secret motions of things; and the enlargin g of the bounds of human empire, to the effecting of all things possible.\" The Father of the wise men then described the labor atories, observatories, mines and hospitals; and t he various engines and inventions by which the element s could be controlled and the secrets of Nature dis covered. There were gardens for the study of plants, and par ks filled with birds and animals so that men could investigate their habits. Even reptiles, insects, and fishes w ere considered and their uses classified. Medicines of all kinds were distilled and compounde d, and mechanical arts were perfected according to the laws of Nature. There were houses where the senses of man were stud ied with the aid of perfumes, flavors, sounds, music, and extraordinary accoustical devices. And there were houses where only deceits were on re cord, so that the methods by which men can be deceived could be made known and studied. In the philosophical city all men were employed acc ording to their tastes and ability, and each contributed in his own way to the sum of useful kno wledge. There were museums where rare and excellen t inventions were preserved, and galleries containing the statues of great men who had contributed to th e improvement of the human race. Among the statues w as one to Christopher Columbus; another to the man who had invented bread. The narration ends abruptly with the word of the ed itor that the rest was not perfected. Missing is that part which was to describe the laws of a philosophical commonwealth. It is safe to assume that these laws, like the whole pattern of t he story, were the same set forth by Plato for the government of the wise. Everything indicates that it was Bacon's dream that the college of the six days should be erected in America, an area peculiarly set aside by Nature for the perfection of philosophy and the sciences. Part of this dream has been realized. In this land are the greatest laboratories, observatories, and institutions of research that the world has ever kn own. We are exploring into the mysteries of the at oms and the electrons, and have brought the heavenly fire, elec tricity, to be the servant of our purposes. All that remains is to crown science with philosoph y. As we perfect the inner part of learning the philosophic empire will arise in human society."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 12 WESTERN CULTURE A THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE COLUMBU S In the Mexican area the civilization then existing was the most advanced on the earth ...

From the physical evidence and the material remains we know that the empire of the Mayas extended over a very l arge area; included were at least a hundred cities, con nected by an intricate pattern of broad paved highw ays. Enough of the art of the Mayas has survived to enti tle them to a high place in the sphere of creative aesthetics; and their massive stone and plaster buildings prove that they possessed a well developed knowledge of architectonics. They had observatories for the stu dy of the arts and developed a highly accurate cale ndar. Their written language, more complicated than the Chinese , is of a type suited to the expression of exact kn owledge and the most refined mental and emotional reflexes. According to their own legends the Mayas owed their cultural superiority to a mysterious old man who came out of the sea riding on a raft of serpents. Among various tribes this man has different names, but he is best known by the title conferred upon him in the M exican area. Here he was called Quetzalcoatl. He is said to have come from the east from the land of the many c olored rocks. Quetzalcoatl carried with him the sy mbol of the cross. His name means the \"feathered snake,\" o r the \"serpent covered with the plumes of the Quetz al bird.\" The Feathered Snake taught the people of Central Am erica all of the useful arts and raised them from a primitive state to one of an excellent civilization . He instructed them in agriculture, architecture, medicine, science, language, religion, and statesmanship. Ha ving accomplished the civilization of the Indian tr ibes, he ruled over them for a time as a benevolent priest-k ing. Then he returned to the shore of the sea, cal led to his raft of serpents, and then floated away to the east , with the promise to return at a distant day to ru le over his nation. When Cortez reached the coast of Mexico the Aztec K ing, Montezuma, dispatched messengers of State bearing with them the plumed crown of Mexico. The trusting Aztec thought that Cortez was Quetzalcoatl returned, and was ready immediately to surrender th e throne ! The Mayan Empire was the highest civilization to be developed in the Americas. Also, it was the first great democratic State on a continent curiously set aside for the perfection of the dream of democracy . So far as we know, the rulers of the Mayas were not hereditary, but were elected for life by the commo n agreement of the people. They seemed to have gover ned wisely and to have fulfilled the classical requ irements of priest-kings. The priesthood itself was powerfu l but benevolent, given to learning, and a patron o f the arts and sciences. The religion consisted of a monothei sm, that is, the worship of one Supreme Principle a biding in the sun."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Next to Deity, peculiar veneration was given to the Feathered Snake, who was regarded as a kind of Messiah, who suffered, died, and arose again. The legend of Quetzalcoatl was thus in parallel with th e myth of the dying God, very much as in Egypt, Chaldea, Gree ce, and as expressed by the early Christian Church. The Mayas were not a warlike people, and there is n o support for popular belief that they were by natu re cruel or barbaric. On the altars of their gods the y offered only flowers and fruit; and it was not un til the decline of the empire and its domination by less advanced t ribes that human sacrifice was practiced, and then only on the rarest occasions. It is believed that the Mayas hold the world record for continued peace. They flourished as a great powerful nation for five hundred years without war with other tribes or internal strife. The high civilization attained by the Mayas was due primarily to the laws given them by Quetzalcoatl. So long as they obeyed these laws they continued to prosper. Unfortunately we have no complete record of their legal codes, but we do know a few of the outs tanding principles which lay at the root of their S tate. The Mayan nation was a collective commonwealth livi ng under an advanced form of socialized order. They possessed all goods in common, and shared equa lly in the benefits of their production. They poss essed no money or monetary symbol of any kind; and it has b een suggested that this lack of currency was in par t responsible for their five hundred years of peace. To them the wheel was the symbol of death, and they never developed any form of mechanized industry. Each gave a part of his goods to maintai n the State, and this contribution was employed to build public buildings, parks, schools, and places of pub lic sport. There seems to have been no poverty, and little if any crime. No buildings have been found which suggest prisons or other places of confinement. The Mayas were hospitable, kindly, gentle, and indu strious; their cities were beautiful in every way; they were public spirited, well governed, and accor ding to the order of their time, highly educated. The religious temper of the people can be gathered from remnants that still survive. It is common to all the Indians of the Americas that religious intolera nce is utterly beyond their comprehension. They lo ok upon each man's religion as his own particular belief, a nd if it suits his needs it deserves the respect of all other right- minded men. Thus we see that the archetype for a generous and e nlightened way of life is part of the American continent's common inheritance. It is well to note in passing that many of the simp ler virtues practiced by the Mayas were shared by other tribes that inhabited North and South America . Although the North American Indians never achiev ed the high culture reached by the Mayas, all lived accord ing to a democratic tradition. The members of all tribes took care of their aged, provided for the widowed and th e fatherless, and severely punished in the rare ins tances when some tribesman attempted to exploit another. Tribal government was invested in a council of the older and the wiser, and all matters relating to the comm on good were submitted to them for arbitration and solution. Crime was almost unknown. As most tribes were nomadic they had little opportu nity to develop inter-tribal points of view, and so there was considerable strife between tribes, but e ven in their warfare, North American Indians respec ted valor and developed chivalry to a marked degree. The first League of Nations was created among the G reat Lakes Indians of the American North east. First, five tribes, and later seven, combined under the leadership of the brilliant Indian leader, Gre at Rabbit, whose life has descended to us in Longfellow's poem , Hiawatha . The league of the seven nations was originally intended to be defensive, but also usefu l in settling inter-tribal disputes. It resulted f rom the simple discovery by aboriginal minds that one lived longer , more safely, and more happily if disputes among p eoples were solved by arbitration rather than by open stri fe. The Incas of Peru are second to the Mayas in the bu ilding of empire in America. Inca communities were also cooperative, and many of these villages s till survive in the distant and less accessible hig h lands of the Andes. These were the only civilized communiti es in our land that never learned that there was a world depression beginning in 1929. Rooted in the American continent is a long and dist inguished tradition that points toward ability for leadership in the postwar world, along lines of coo peration and the international point of view. The democracy established by thirteen colonies in 1 776 was not the first American democracy. At least two thousand years before the coming of the white m an, the spirit of human equality, human cooperation , and freedom of worship flourished here."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" 13 BACON'S SECRET SOCIETY IS SET UP IN AMERICA Men bound by a secret oath to labor in the cause of world democracy decided that in the American colonies they would plant the roots of a new way of life. Brotherhoods were established to meet secretly, and they quietly and industriously conditioned America to its destiny for leadership in a free world. ... Benjamin Franklin exercised an enormous psychological influence in Co lonial politics as the appointed spokesman of the unknown philosophers; he did not make laws, but his words became law. C OLONIZATION of the Western Hemisphere was largely motivated in the desire to pillage the fabulous treasures of the new world. The explorers, led on by legends of hoards of gold and silver, and palace s encrusted with jewels, formed expeditions often fin anced from their own purses but sometimes subsidize d by the State. The Spanish were the most successful in their quest for riches; the majority of the other adventurers profited little and suffered much; and it soon bec ame apparent that only by sober colonization was an y sizeable reward to be gained in the new world. For the promulgation of the Christian faith, the We stern Hemisphere offered virgin territory. With th e Conquistadores came priests, eager to convert pagan tribes and nations to the faith of the old world. A holy inquisition was set up in New Spain, and Indians by the tens of thousands were tortured and killed for the good of their immortal souls. It was due to the zeal of the priests that the libraries of the Mayans were burned and their historical records destroyed. To this day there stands in Merida, on the peninsul a of Yucatan, the house of the Conquistador Montejo. Over the door of this house are the heral dic arms of this Spanish adventurer. The shield an d crest are upheld by Spanish soldiers standing on the heads of tortured and enslaved Mayan Indians. Reasonably accurate accounts of the natural advanta ges and resources of the Americas were in time brought back by the explorers and adventurers who h ad opened the new territories of the West, and only then did the European nations give serious consideration to actual development of their newly acquired colo nial empires. The French, the Dutch, and the English en tered upon programs of establishing permanent settl ements along the Atlantic seaboard. The English program w as under the direction of Sir Francis Bacon, and it was his genius that gave purpose to the enterprise. Bacon quickly realized that here in the new world w as the proper environment for the accomplishment of his great dream, the establishment of the philos ophic empire. It must be remembered that Bacon did not play a lone hand; he was the head of a secret society i ncluding in its membership the most brilliant intel lectuals of his day. All these men were bound together by a co mmon oath to labor in the cause of a world democrac y. Bacon's society of the unknown philosophers include d men of high rank and broad influence. Together w ith Bacon, they devised the colonization scheme. Word was passed about through secret channels that here in the Western Hemisphere was the promised land of the future. Here men of right purpose coul d build a new way of life, free from the religious intolerance and political despotism that held Europe in its clu tches. The history books tell us that the colonists made t he long and dangerous journey in small ships in ord er to find a place where they could worship God, each according to the dictates of his own conscience. T here is however much more to the story than our historians have dared to suggest. Among the colonizers were some who belonged to the Order of the Quest, but it was not long before religious strife broke out in the colonies, for men do not change their natures merely by changing the ir place of habitation. Much of the intolerance of the old wor ld came over to plague the beginnings of the new civilization. It was not easy to preserve high pri nciples in pioneering a country. A lot had to be d one before the philosophic empire could emerge out of the simple s truggle for existence. And much has yet to be accomplished; we are still pioneering in the sphere of right thinking and right living. Bacon's secret society was set up in America before the middle of the 17th Century. Bacon himself had given up all hope of bringing his dream to fruition in his own country, and he concentrated his attent ion upon rooting it in the new world. He made sure that the American colonists were thoroughly indoctrinated w ith the principles of religious tolerance, political democr acy, and social equality. Through carefully appoin ted"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"representatives, the machinery of democracy was set up at least a hundred years before the period of t he Revolutionary War. Bacon's secret society membership was not limited t o England; it was most powerful in Germany, in France, and in the Netherlands, and most of the lea ders of European thought were involved in the vast pattern of his purpose. The mystic empire of the wise had no national boundaries and its citizenry was made u p of men of good purpose in every land. The Alchemists, Cab alists, Mystics, and Rosicrucians were the incisive instruments of Bacon's plan. Representatives of th ese groups migrated to the colonies at an early dat e and set up their organization in suitable places. One example will indicate the trend. About 1690, t he German Pietist theologian, Magistar Johannes Kelpius, sailed for America with a group of followe rs all of whom practiced mystical and esoteric rite s. The Pietists settled in Pennsylvania and their clescend ents still flourish in Lancaster county. Kelpius f or some years lived as an Anchorite in a cave located in what is now Fairmount Park, Philadelphia. The Pietists bro ught with them the writings of the German mystic, Jacob Boehm e, books on magic, astrology, alchemy, and the caba la. They had curious manuscripts illuminated with stran ge designs, and their principal text was called \" An A B C Book for Young Students Studying in the College of the Holy Ghost .\" The Pietists brought the order of the Mustard Seed, and the Order of the Woman in the Wil derness to the new world. Kelpius was a man of feeble health and after a few years died from the hardships and exposures of his religious austerity. The inner circle of his order was composed entirely of celibates, and as these d ied there were none to take their places; and so far as the p ublic knows, his secret society did not survive. A ctually it did continue; but with the changing of the times it re turned again to its secret foundations, disappearin g entirely from the public view. The early years of the 18th Century brought with th em many changes in the social and political life of the American colonies. By this time most of the At lantic seaboard was dominated by the English. Citi es had sprung up, important trade flourished with the moth er country, and the colonial atmosphere was in smal l counterpart that of the English countryside. By this time most of the important secret societies of Europe were well represented in this country. T he brotherhoods met in their rooms over inns and simil ar public buildings, practicing their ancient ritua ls exactly according to the fashion in Europe and England. Th ese American organizations were branches under Euro pean sovereignty, with the members in the two hemisphere s bound together with the strongest bonds of sympat hy and understanding. The program that Bacon had outl ined was working out according to schedule. Quietl y and industriously, America was being conditioned for it s destiny--leadership in a free world. Any account of secret societies in America would ha ve to include tribute to the man who has been called the \"First American Gentleman\"--Benjamin Fra nklin. Although Dr. Franklin was never the country 's President, nor a military general, he stands out as one of the most important figures in the struggle for American independence. Quiet, dignified, scholarly and gent le, Franklin foresaw a new goal for an ever changin g world through the square bi-focal glasses of which he was the inventor. Historians have never ceased to wonder at the enorm ous psychological influence which Franklin exercised in colonial politics. But up to the pres ent day, few indeed are those who have realized tha t the source of his power lay in the secret societies to which h e belonged and of which he was the appointed spokes man. Franklin was not a law maker, but his words became law. Beneath the homely wisdom which he circulated in his Almanac, under the pseudonym of Poor Richard, w as a profundity of scientific and philosophic learn ing. He understood both the farmer and the philosopher, and could speak the languages of both. When Benjamin Franklin went to France to be honored by the State, he was received too by the Lodge of Perfection, the most famous of all the French se cret orders; and his name, written in his own fine hand, is in their record ledger, close to that of the Marquis d e Lafayette. Franklin spoke for the Order of the Quest, and most of the men who worked with him in the early days of the American Revolution were also members. The plan was working out, the New Atlantis was coming i nto being, in accordance with the program laid down by Francis Bacon a hundred and fifty years earlier. The rise of American democracy was necessary to a w orld program. At the appointed hour, the freedom of man was publicly declared."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 14 A PROPHECY WRITTEN IN THE YEAR OF WASHINGTON'S BIRTH Sir William Hope noted the birth overseas of an inf ant starred by fate to rule both freemen and slaves , and named the year of the American Declaration of I ndependence forty-four years before it was signed. He gave in Cabalistic form the patr iot leader's name, and the years of his lifetime sp an. ... The prophecy also singled out Abraham Lincoln, designated the term of Benjamin Harrison as the one to mark the first century of the new nat ion's progress. ... It is a reasonable assumption that the Hope prophecy is a genuine example of fore -knowledge of the destiny of the United States. George Washington had just been born when the governo r of Edinburg Castle wrote a prophecy that this infa nt born overseas was starred by fate to lead the colonies to freedom; this predict ion also named, four decades in advance, the year o f the Declaration of Independence I N the Congressional Library at Washington, D.C., is a curious little book entitled, Vindication of the True Art of Self Defense . It is a work on fencing and dueling, published i n 1724 by Sir William Hope, Bart., a deputy governor of Edinburg Castle. In this copy a nd facing the title page an engraving has been inse rted of the badge of the Royal Society of Swordsmen; underneath it is written, \"Private Library of Sir William Hop e.\" The Library of Congress has had this book since 1879. The text of this curious little book is of no speci al interest, but on the blank flyleaves is written in the hand of Sir William Hope an extraordinary predictio n concerning the destiny of the United States of Am erica. It was written, signed and dated forty-four years b efore the beginning of the Revolutionary War. At the time the thirteen American colonies semingly had no dream of independence. George Washington had just been born, in Virginia. Twenty of the fifty-six men who were to sign the Declarat ion of Independence were then small boys, and eighteen oth ers were yet unborn. Little information is available concerning Sir Will iam Hope; but from the text of his prediction it appears that he was devoted to the study of astrolo gy, and based his strange prophetic poem upon an interpretation of the starry influences. There is also a hint of the Cabala in the manner used by Hop e to indicate the men referred to in his prediction. The prophecy of Sir William Hope begins with these lines: 'Tis Chaldee says his fate is great Whose stars do bear him fortunate. Of thy near fate, Amerika, I read in stars a prophecy: Fourteen divided, twelve the same, Sixteen in halfs--each holds a name; Four, eight, seven, six--added ten-- The life line's mark of Four gt. men. From the text, the prophecy covers the period from 1732 to 1901. From the history of our country during this period of time, Hope selected four men, and the numbers which he used to indicate them are shown as the prophecy unfolds. He summarizes the lives o f these four men by totaling the number of years th at each lived. He does this in the line, Four, eight, seven, six--added ten --\" Four plus eight, plus seven, plus six, equal 25, the added ten is the cipher making a total of 2 50. At the time of his death George Washington was 68, Abraham Lincoln 56, Benjamin Harrison 68, and Willi am McKinley 58. The total of these years is 250. The next twelve lines are devoted to a description of George Washington and the struggle of the American colonies for independence. This day is cradled, far beyond the sea, One starred by fate to rule both bond and free. The prophecy is dated 1732, and in that year George Washington was born beyond the sea, in Virginia. The reference to bond and free is believed to indic ate that slavery would exist during Washington's ti me in the colony of Virginia. Add double four, thus fix the destined day When servile knees unbend 'neath freedom's sway."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"By double four we can read 44, which if added to th e date, 1732, gives 1776, the year of the American Declaration of Independence. Place six 'fore ten, then read the patriot's name Whose deeds shall link him to a deathless fame. Add double four, thus fix the destined day There are six letters in the name George, and ten i n Washington, and this Cabala when added to the previous and subsequent descriptions, can leave no doubt as to the man intended in the prophecy. Whose growing love and ceaseless trust wrong none And catch truth's colors from its glowing sun ! Death's door shall clang while yet his century wait s, His planets point the way to other's pending fates. These lines contain not only a glowing tribute but an exact bit of prophesy. Washington died on December 14, 1799, just 17 days before his century passed into history. Till all the names on freedom's scroll shall fade, Two tombs be built, his lofty cenotaph be made-- Freedom's scroll is the Declaration of Independence , which is now carefully preserved under yellow cellophane because the signatures have begun to fad e. The body of George Washington has rested in two tombs; and his lofty cenotaph, the Washington Monum ent, is 555 feet high, the tallest memorial ever constructed to the memory of a man. Full six times ten the years must onward glide, Nature their potent help, a constant, prudent guide . If six times ten years, or sixty years, be added to the date of the death of Washington the result is 1859, when John Brown raided Harper's Ferry and was hange d for attempting to incite a slave revolt, a circum stance leading directly to the United States of America en gaging in the great Civil War to preserve the freed om of all of its people. Then fateful seven 'fore seven shall sign heroic so n Whom Mars and Jupiter strike down before his work i s done. When cruel fate shall pierce, though artless of its sword; Who leaves life's gloomy stage without one farewell word. A softly beaming star, half veiled by Mars' red clo ud Virtue, his noblest cloak, shall form a fitting shr oud. There are seven letters in Abraham, and seven lette rs in Lincoln. He is the \"heroic son\" elected to t he Presidency in 1860, re-elected in 1864, and assassi nated April 14, 1865. He was indeed struck down be fore his work was done, for slavery was not abolished by con stitutional amendment until the end of that year, a nd the Civil War was not proclaimed to be at an end until August 20, 1866. The reference to life's gloomy stage is the more ex traordinary because Lincoln was assassinated at Ford's Theater while watching a play; and he never spoke again after the assassin's bullet struck him although he lived for several hours. References to President Benjamin Harrison are conta ined in the two following lines: Then eight 'fore eight a later generation rules, With light undimmed and shed in progress' school. There are eight letters in Benjamin, and eight in H arrison. He ruled in a later generation, 1889 to 1 893. His administration was justly climaxed by the great Columbian Exposition at Chicago in 1893. Here, invention, transportation, industry, art, science, and agriculture exhibited the progress which they h ad made in the first century of American national existence. This is probably the 'progress school' referred to in the prediction. Harrison's administration was not dimm ed by war or by any scandals in high office. Then six again, with added six shall rise, Resplendent ruler--good, and great--and wise. Four sixes hold a glittering star that on his way s hall shine; And twice four sixes mark his years from birth to m anhood's prime. While the verses accurately describe President McKi nley, this is the only instance in which the number s do not appear to fit the name. Research, however, indicates that the original form of the family name would permit it to be divided, thus, Will-Mc Kinley, whic h means, Will, the son of Kinley. In this form, ea ch of the combinations would contain six letters. Four sixes , or 24, agrees with President McKinley being the 2 4th man to hold the presidential office. And twice four si xes, or 48, was the age of McKinley at the time he was elected Governor of his native state, which might be said t o be his 'manhood's prime'. There is no reference to McKinley's second term or his assassination. But t he prophecy definitely states that it goes no farth er than the"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"end of the 79th Century. It does indicate earlier however, that McKinley's life was to be 58 years, w hich was correct. The prophecy ends with four more lines: These truths prophetic shall completion see Ere time's deep grave receives the Nineteenth Centu ry ! All planets, stars, twelve signs and horoscope Attest these certain truths foretold by William Hop e. Following this, is the statement that the prophecy was 'Writ at Cornhill, London, 1732.' At the botto m of the page are four other lines written by some la ter member of the Hope family as a tribute to the m emory of Sir William Hope: The learned hand that writ these lines no more shall pen for me, Yet voice shall speak and pulses beat for long post erity. This soul refined through love of kind bewailed lif e's labors spent, Then found this truth, his search from youth, Great ness is God's accident.-- James Hope As is usual with material of this kind, efforts hav e been made to prove the Hope Prophecy to be a forgery; but up to the present time no tangible evi dence has been advanced to disprove the prediction. Always in these matters, the critic takes the attitude tha t such predictions can not be made, and if a writin g appears to be authentic then it must be imposture. The book has been in the Library of Congress for more than 60 ye ars. The prediction about both Harrison and McKinley relate to incidents taking place after the book was placed in the Congressional Library. In facsimile, one of the two pages of the original prophecy is illustrated here; both have every appearance of being genuine and authentic. It is most reasonable to assume that the Hope proph ecy is a genuine example of foreknowledge concerning the future of the United States of Ameri ca."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" 15 THE UNKNOWN MAN WHO DESIGNED OUR FLAG Our flag was worked out in elements of design that provided for gradual modification in the future as the national destiny increased. I t was a learned stranger, added by seeming accident to the committee appointe d by the Colonial Congress in 1775, who had the foresight to provide the area for the stars in subsequent substitution for the British Union Jack. The desig n was adopted by General Washington; there is no record that the committee ever made a report to Congress. ... According to the rules laid down by Francis Bacon f or works published under the authority of the society of unknown philo sophers, each book must be so marked as to be readily recognizable. The book that tells of the presence of the unknown designer ends with a quotation from Bacon. R OBERT Allen Campbell in 1890 published a little book Our Flag, or The Evolution of the Stars and Stripes . Diligent research fails to uncover any data abou t Mr. Campbell. He states in his preface that the work is \"a compilation of facts and dates from official sources, larger works, occasional pamphlets and add resses upon this and collateral subjects; and is meant, t herefore, for the perusal of those who have not the time, opportunity or disposition for a more extended stud y in this line of research.\" Then he refers specifically to the chapter of inter est to our present consideration: \"That part of th is sketch which treats of die proceedings of the Congr essional Committee in relation to the Colonial Flag , and of the unofficial consideration, by a few of our Revol utionary statesmen and heroes, in regard to the Fla g of the 'Thirteen United States,' immediately preceding its adoption by Congress, has not heretofore been publ ished.\" This last statement makes it extremely difficult to trace Mr. Campbell's source of information. We ar e forced to the conclusion that the story must have b een given to him by word of mouth. The book itself must have been printed in a very sm all edition, for it has become exceedingly scarce a nd is seldom if ever offered for sale. On those rare occasions when copies have changed hands, the book commands a price far in excess of usual works in th is field. According to the rules laid down by Sir Francis Bac on for works published under the authority of the society of unknown philosophers, each book must be marked in some peculiar way, easily recognizable by the informed, but not conspicuous to those who are not a party to the plan. All of the older writings are so marked, either with ciphers, curious headpieces, vignettes, colophons, designs, symbols, figures, or signature s. It is possible that the book, Our Flag carries such a sig nature; for it ends with the following quotation, \"Out of monuments, names, words, proverbs, private records and evidences, fragments of stories, passages in bo oks, and the like, we save and recover somewhat from the deluge of time.\" --Bacon. One thing is certain, Robert Allen Campbell has con cluded his treatise with a curiously meaningful passage from the writings of the man responsible fa r the broad program of colonization in the western world that made possible the creation of the United State s of America. The selection of Bacon's words to co nclude the book may be accident, and it may be intent; bu t in the light of the text and the air of mystery w hich covers the history of the writing and the life of the auth or, it appears more than possible that intent is th e answer. Chapter 2 of Our Flag is entitled, \"The Colonial Flag\" This in substanc e is what it says: In the fall of 1775, the Colonial Congress in sessi on at Philadelphia appointed Messrs. Franklin, Lync h, and Harrison as a committee to consider and recomme nd a design for a Colonial Flag. General Washingto n was then in camp at Cambridge, Massachusetts, and t he Committee went there to consult with him. While at Cambridge the committee men were entertain ed by a patriotic and well-to-do citizen. At that time the best room in this gentleman's residence wa s temporarily occupied by a peculiar old gentleman. As there was only one other guestroom, Messrs. Lynch a nd Harrison were given the unoccupied room, and Dr. Franklin shared apartments with the old gentleman. Nothing is known about the mysterious old man excep t that he was referred to as the \"Professor\"; his name is not preserved. He was beyond seventy years of age but apparently in the prime of his life. H e ate no flesh, fish, nor fowl, or any green things, and dra nk no liquor, wine, or ale. His diet consisted of cereals, well ripened fruit, nuts, tea, and such sweets as honey and molasses. He was well educated, highly culture d, of extensive as well as varied information, and very s tudious. He spent most of his time pondering over rare"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"books and ancient manuscripts, which he seemed to b e deciphering, translating, or rewriting. These he kept carefully locked up in a heavy iron-bound chest and never showed them to any person. He was liberal but in no ways lavish with his money , but was well supplied with all that he needed. Th e Professor was a staunch advocate of democracy and h is favorite statement was, \"We demand no more than our just due; we will accept and be satisfied with not hing less than we demand.\" On the eve of their arrival, December 13, the commi ttee men dined with their host and hostess, also General Washington and the Professor. The Professo r was introduced to the visitors without his name b eing given, and his ease, grace, and dignity during the introduction is especially noted. When Benjamin Fr anklin was presented, he stepped forward and extended his hand, which the Professor heartily accepted. As th eir eyes met there was an instantaneous, a very apparent, an d a mutually gratified recognition. After dinner, Washington and the committee men exch anged a few words in undertone, and then Dr. Franklin arose, saying, in substance, \"As the Chair man of this committee, speaking for my associates, and with their consent, and with the approval of General Was hington, I respectfully invite the Professor to mee t with the committee as one of its members; and we, each one, personally and urgently, request him to accept the responsibility, and to give us, and the American Co lonies, the benefit of his presence and his counsel .\" After graciously accepting the invitation, the Prof essor made his first recommendation. He pointed ou t that the Committee now consisted of six persons, Ge neral Washington and the host being honorary member s. Six was not an auspicious number, and as none of th e members could be spared, let the hostess be inclu ded so that the number could be increased to seven. This suggestion was unanimously accepted and the hostess became the secretary of the committee. The committee met the following evening in the Prof essor's room. General Washington opened the proceedings by asking Dr. Franklin for his recommen dations. Franklin replied by requesting that the e ntire committee listen to the words of his new found and abundantly honored friend, the Professor, who had d efinite suggestions to make. After a preamble, the Professor made the following extraordinary remarks: \"The sun of our political air, like the sun in the heavens, is very low in the horizon--just now approaching the winter solstice, which it will reac h very soon. But, as the sun rises from his grave in Capricorn, mounts toward his resurrection in Aries, and passes onward and upward to his glorious culmi nation in Cancer, so will our political sun rise and conti nue to increase in power, in light, and in glory; and the exalted sun of summer will not have gained his full strengt h of heat and power in the starry Lion until our Co lonial Sun will be, in its glorious exaltation, demanding a pl ace in the governmental firmaments alongside of, co ordinate with, and in no wise subordinate to, any other sun of any other nation upon earth.\" The Professor went on to point out that the flag wh ich he recommended would be subject to change in the future as the national destiny increased. This change, however, should not require a complete re- designing but a process of gradual modification: \"To make it announce and represent the new nation which is alr eady gestating in the womb of time; and which will come to birth--and that not prematurely, but fully deve loped and ready for the change into independent life--before the sun in its next summer's strength ripens our ne xt harvest.\" The design finally submitted consisted of a field o f thirteen alternate red and white stripes, and in the area which now contains the stars was the British U nion Jack. The area containing the Union Jack was the one suitable for modification. The design was formally and unanimously accepted, and the flag was adopted by General Washington as the recognized standard of th e Colonial Army and Navy. There is no record of an y report being made by this committee to Congress. On January 2, 1776, at Cambridge, in the presence o f the Army, General Washington with his own hands raised the newly made flag on a tall and spec ially prepared pine tree liberty pole. The British army at Charleston Heights could see the flag clearly. Aft er inspecting it with their field glasses, the Brit ish officers ordered a salute of thirteen cheers, followed by a regular official salute of thirteen guns in honor o f the new standard. It appears therefore, that the Colonial Flag was as pleasing to the British as it was to th e Colonies. It is easy to see why Mr. Campbell's story has rece ived very little recorded recognition. It belongs among those shadowy and mysterious happenings which influence or change the course of empire but will ever find little favor with prosaic and unimaginative hi storians.

There is little doubt that he assisted Jefferson in writing the Declaration of Independence. ... Pai ne emphasized the necessity of separating the spheres of Church and State in go vernment, preached religious tolerance in a day when the spirit of persecution was still s trong, attacked the special privileges of the aristocracy. ... Only by thousands of years of conditioning can mankind be brought to the perfectionist state envisioned by this American patriot. Of Thomas Paine it has been said that he did more to win the independence of the colonies with his pen th an George Washington accomplished with his sword, Only complete reorganiz ation of government, religion, and education would b ring us even today to the perfectionist state Tom Paine envisioned T HE stormy petrel of Revolutionary days in America and France was Thomas Paine. Son of a hard working Quaker who made his living cutting barrel s taves, young Thomas's formal education ended in gra m mar school; he practiced his father's trade for a t ime before turning his mind to politics and the soc ial problems of his time. Benjamin Franklin inspired Thomas Pain e to become a champion of human rights. Their firs t meeting took place in England, and at Franklin's su ggestion Paine came to America and entered into the publishing business. English born, he became an ou tstanding champion in the cause of freedom for the colonies. His writings so fanned the flame of patr iotism that it has been said of him that he did mor e to win the independence of the colonies with his pen than Geor ge Washington accomplished with his sword. There is little doubt that Thomas Paine assisted Je fferson in writing the Declaration of Independence. Present research even points to the probability tha t he composed the entire document, then submitted i t to Jefferson for editing and revision. The references in the Declaration of Independence to \"the Laws of Nature\" and \"Nature's God\" especially reflect Paine's theol ogical convictions. Paine held several offices in the Continental gover nment during the period of the Revolutionary War, and in 1789 returned to Europe. Three years later he published his Rights of Man . Although the truths contained in the essay were never successfully cont roverted, the book, caused repercussions that force d him to leave England to escape trial for treason. He soug ht refuge in France. Almost immediately he became involved in the French Revolution as a staunch supporter of the revolutionary party. He boldly advocated the p erpetual banishment of Louis XVI, but was opposed to the exe cution of the king. His tolerant views on this sub ject must have alienated the Terrorists, for Robespierre caus ed him to be imprisoned under sentence of death by the guillotine. It was just before this imprisonment t hat he published the first part of his immortal boo k, Age of Reason ; he wrote the second part during the ten months o f his incarceration. Paine's escape from death in France was by one of t hose unforeseen circumstances which so often have changed the course of history. Robespierre fell fr om power. His successors restored Paine to his sea t in the revolutionary convention. When things in France had settled down to the sober process of setting up a permanent government, Paine turned his attention to George Washington, wh om he bitterly attacked, thus losing much of his po pularity in America. Paine returned to the United States in 1802 and his closing years were comparatively uneventful. He died in 1809. Ten years later his body was sent ba ck to England to be re-interred in his native earth . Thomas Paine was a free thinker, a radical pamphlet er. It was his misfortune to be \"born out of time. \" Yet by his very birth and the energy of his nature he helped to change the face of time. He attacked the corruption of the British Government with such hone sty and skill that he was the most feared man in En gland. Then, with the simple conviction of a Quaker Deist, he threw the power of his written word against the religious corruption that burdened the peoples of E urope and interfered with the social progress of ma nkind. In the Age of Reason , Paine emphasized the necessity of separating the spheres of Church and State, looking at both institutions in their practical sta te of corruption rather than in their ideal state o f mutual integrity. He held a broad view of religion in gen eral, believing that all faiths were naturally good and were necessary to the spiritual security of humanity. S uch broadness was out of season, and it made him nu merous enemies among those holding fanatical convictions. It was dangerous to preach religious tolerance in his day, when the spirit of persecution was still strong."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"When the clergy involved itself in the political co nspiracies of the State and descended to the level of self-interest, their spiritual power was prostitute d; and, said Paine, they lost all claim upon public respect. Paine saw the conniving, plotting, and counter plot ting of religious leaders who had cast their lot wi th the aristocracy against long suffering and exploited ci tizens. With a Church such as this he had no patie nce, and he had the eloquence and abundant courage to express h is convictions regardless of the cost. He held the aristocracy in general in equal antipat hy. Privileged classes, to him, were little better than parasites, living off the toil of honest men in tot al indifference to the public good. A government c ompounded from a dissolute nobility and fawning professional office holders, ever catering to the longer purse, brought Paine's righteous indignation to the boiling point, indignation which he could apply in words understa ndable to the masses. It was his simple reasoning that such a Church, plus such a State, equalled chaos. It wa s bad enough for government to burden the people with ext ravagances, but it was still worse for the Church t o preach that men should accept this load as coming from God , to see it designed to purify their souls by the p ractice of patience and humility. It was not enough for Paine to believe that all men were created free and equal; these free men had t he inalienable right of representative government; and the further right to improve themselves to the enj oyment of all natural good. He was more of a perfectionist than was practical i n his own day or even in our time. Like most idealists, he failed to accept the weakness in that very human nature which he sought so desperately t o champion. Only thousands of years of conditioning and the complete reorganization of government, reli gion, and education could bring mankind to the estate whi ch Paine envisioned. He called men to a high desti ny, and men understood in part and applied in part, but lac ked the capacity for a full and understanding accep tance. This probably explains Paine's bitter attack on Geo rge Washington. Paine had been present when the American government was formed, and he must have be en at least a witness to the bickerings which went on during those most critical years. As a president, Washington was not universally popular; it was onl y after considerable engineering that his election had been accomplished. Almost immediately the new governme nt fell into political difficulty. Self-seeking polit icians appeared on the scene at the very beginning, just as they have never since been absent from the picture. Pai ne, seeing some of the noblest ideals of the new St ate perverted and misinterpreted, dared to speak when d iscretion held the tongues of other men. In Paine's own public career, made up largely of re verses, he chose to accept all forms of personal humiliation rather than modify any of his attitudes . He never accepted that such a policy as he advoc ated would be impractical in a permanent form of government. Political experience leads the wisest of public men to the realization that the possibilities of publi c office are limited, and that good things must be brought a bout slowly and opportunely if they are to survive public inertia and opposition. But in principle Paine was right, and he has left imperishable landmarks. He was a Utopian, a dreamer with a mighty courage o f conviction. And when the dream of world democracy is finally realized, Paine's name and mem ory will be immortalized; for he was outstanding a mong the great pioneers of human progress. Thomas Paine's crusading was part of that secret de stiny which has ordained that all people shall be f ree and equal. Many times his career appeared to have been ended b y the accidents of ill fortune, but always he was preserved against his enemies, and even against him self. He was one of the links in that golden chain which binds the earth to the pinnacle of high Olympus."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" 17 THE UNKNOWN WHO SWAYED THE SIGNERS OF THE DECLA RATION OF INDEPENDENCE Faced with the death penalty for high treason, cour ageous men debated long before they picked up the quill pen to sign th e parchment that declared the independence of the colonies from the mother country. For many hours they had debated in the State House at Philadelphia, with the lower chamber doors locked and a guard pos ted--when suddenly a voice rang out from the balcony. A burst of eloquence to the keyn ote, \"God has given America to be free!\" ended with the delegates rushing forward to sign. . .. The American patriots then turned to express their gratitude to the unkno wn speaker. The speaker was not in the balcony; he was not to be found anywhere. How he entered and left the locked and guarded room is not known. No one k nows to this day who he was. S OME years ago, while visiting the Theosophical colony at Ojai, California, A.P. Warrington, esoteric secretary of the society, discussed with me a numbe r of historical curiosities, which led to examinati on of his rare old volume of early American political speeche s of a date earlier than those preserved in the fir st volumes of the Congressional Record . He made particular mention of a speech by an unknow n man at the time of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. The particular book w as not available at that moment, but Mr. Warrington offered to send me a copy of the speech, and he did ; but unfortunately neglected to append the title or the date of the book. He went to India subsequently, and di ed at the Theosophical headquarters at Adyar, in Ma dras. Then, in May, 1938, the speech appeared in The Theosophist , official organ of the society published in Adyar. In all probability the original book is now in the library of the Theosophical society. There is no r eason to doubt the accuracy and authenticity of Mr. Warringt on's copy, but I am undertaking such investigation as is possible to discover the source of the speech. On July 4, 1776, in the old State House in Philadel phia, a group of patriotic men were gathered for th e solemn purpose of proclaiming the liberty of the Am erican colonies. From the letters of Thomas Jeffer son which are preserved in the Library of Congress, I h ave been able to gather considerable data concernin g this portentous session. In reconstructing the scene, it is well to remember that if the Revolutionary War failed every man who had signed the parchment then lying on the table wo uld be subject to the penalty of death for high tre ason. It should also be remembered that the delegates repres enting the various colonies were not entirely of on e mind as to the policies which should dominate the new natio n. There were several speeches. In the balcony patrio tic citizens crowded all available space and listen ed attentively to the proceedings. Jefferson expresse d himself with great vigor; and john Adams, of Bos ton, spoke and with great strength. The Philadelphia printer, Dr. Benjamin Franklin, quiet and calm as usual, sp oke his mind with well chosen words. The delegates hovered between sympathy and uncertainty as the long hours of the summer day crept by, for life is sweet when the re is danger of losing it. The lower doors were lo cked and a guard was posted to prevent interruption. According to Jefferson, it was late in the afternoo n before the delegates gathered their courage to th e sticking point. The talk was about axes, scaffolds , and the gibbet, when suddenly a strong, bold voic e sounded -- \"Gibbet ! They may stretch our necks on all the gibbets in the land; they may turn every rock int o a scaffold; every tree into a gallows; every home i nto a grave, and yet the words of that parchment ca n never die ! They may pour our blood on a thousand scaffolds, and yet from every drop that dyes the axe a new ch ampion of freedom will spring into birth ! The British Ki ng may blot out the stars of God from the sky, but he cannot blot out His words written on that parchment there. The works of God may perish: His words never ! \"The words of this declaration will live in the wor ld long after our bones are dust. To the mechanic in his workshop they will speak hope: to the slave in the mines freedom: but to the coward kings, these words will speak in tones of warning they cannot choose b ut hear... \"Sign that parchment ! Sign, if the next moment th e gibbet's rope is about your neck ! Sign, if the next minute this hall rings with the clash of falling ax es ! Sign, by all your hopes in life or death, as men, as husbands, as fathers, brothers, sign your names to the parchment, or be accursed forever ! Sign, and not only"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"for yourselves, but for all ages, for that parchmen t will be the textbook of freedom, the bible of the rights of man forever. \"Nay, do not start and whisper with surprise !

But methinks I stand among the awful clouds which veil the brightness of Jehovah's thro ne. \"Methinks I see the recording Angel come trembling up to that throne and speak his dread message. 'Father, the old world is baptized in blood. Fathe r, look with one glance of Thine eternal eye, and b ehold evermore that terrible sight, man trodden beneath t he oppressor's feet, nations lost in blood, murder, and superstition, walking hand in hand over the graves of the victims, and not a single voice of hope to m an !' \"He stands there, the Angel, trembling with the rec ord of human guilt. But hark! The voice of God speaks from out the awful cloud: ‘Let there be ligh t again ! Tell my people, the poor and oppressed, to go out from the old world, from oppression and blood, and build My altar in the new.' \"As I live, my friends, I believe that to be His vo ice ! Yes, were my soul trembling on the verge of eternity, were this hand freezing in death, were th is voice choking in the last struggle, I would stil l, with the last impulse of that soul, with the last wave of that ha nd, with the last gasp of that voice, implore you t o remember this truth--God has given America to be free ! \"Yes, as I sank into the gloomy shadows of the grav e, with my last faint whisper I would beg you to sign that parchment for the sake of those millions whose very breath is now hushed in intense expectat ion as they look up to you for the awful words: ‘You are free.' \" The unknown speaker fell exhausted into his seat. The delegates, carried away by his enthusiasm, rushed forward. John Hancock scarcely had time to pen his bold signature before the quill was grasped by another. It was done. The delegates turned to express their gratitude to the unknown speaker for his eloquent words. He was not there. Who was this strange man, who seemed to speak with a divine authority, whose solemn words gave courage to the doubters and sealed the destiny of t he new nation ? Unfortunately, no one knows. His name is not recorded; none of those present kn ew him; or if they did, not one acknowledged the acquaintance. How he had entered into the locked and guarded room is not told, nor is there any record of the manner of his departure. No one claimed to have seen him before, and there i s no mention of him after this single episode. Onl y his imperishable speech bears witness to his presen ce. There are many interesting implications in his word s. He speaks of the ‘rights of man,' although Thomas P aine's book by that name was not published until thirteen years later. He mentions the all-seeing eye of God which was aft erwards to appear on the reverse of the Great Seal of the new nation. In all, there is much to indicate that the unknown speaker was one of the agents of the secret Order, guarding and directing the destiny of America. Some time ago, an eastern publisher suggested to me that an interesting and important title for a book would be, \"The History of Unknown Men.\" This publi sher was a great reader of history; and it was his observation that nearly all great causes are furthe red by mysterious and obscure persons who receive l ittle or no credit for the part which they have played. To write the history of these men would be to write the history of the Order of the Quest, the story o f the unknown philosophers. Some, like Francis Bacon, co me to high estate; but most of the unknowns work obscurely through other men, who gain the credit an d the fame. In an old book of rules used by the brothers of the secret orders, is the following: \"Our brothers sh all wear the dress and practice the customs of those na tions to which they travel so that they shall not b e conspicuous or convey any appearance that is differ ent or unusual. Under no condition shall they reve al their"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"true identity, or the work which they have come to accomplish; but shall accomplish all things secret ly and without violating the laws or statutes of the count ries in which they work.\" Of those who did not ‘reveal their true identity', or the work which they came to accomplish, one is t he mysterious Professor who inspired the design of our flag, and remains unknown and unnamed. And simila rly, another is the unknown speaker whose words removed indecision about signing the Declaration of Independence; it is not known who he was, and the incident is preserved only in a rare old book, the very existence of which it is difficult to prove. It is reasonably conceivable that in secrecy and an onymity well ordered aid has been given to the struggle for human equity and justice that has been America's destiny through the past into our presen t time. It is our duty and our privilege to contribute what we can to this Universal plan. It will go on, served by the unknowns, until the Platonic empire is established on the earth, and the towers of the new Atlantis ri se from the ruins of a materialistic and selfish world."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"18 THE SYMBOLS OF THE GREAT SEAL OF THE U.S. Is the American eagle actually a Phoenix ? Selecti on of the fabulous bird of the ancients seems to have been the intention of the designer of our nation's Great Seal. The Phoenix is the symbol of the Reborn in wisdom. ... The design on the reverse of the Great Seal is even more defin itely related to the Order of the Quest. The pyramid and the all-seeing eye represent the Un iversal House surmounted by the radiant emblem of the Great Architect of the Universe .... These three symbols in combination is more than cha nce or coincidence. W HEN the time came to select an appropriate emblem for the great seal of the United States of America, several designs were submitted. These are described by Gaillard Hunt, in The History of the Seal of the United States , published in Washington, D.C., in 1909. Most of the designs originally submitted had the Phoenix bird on its nest of flames as the central m otif. One of the designs now familiar to us was fi nally selected, and Benjamin Franklin was asked for his o pinion of the choice. Franklin gave his immediate approval, observing nai vely that it was very appropriate to select the wil d turkey as the symbol of the new country: The turke y was a bird of admirable quality, hard working and industrious, and of good moral character, and a fow l also with a marked adversion for the color red, a t that time unpopular among the colonists. When it was explained to Franklin that the bird on the seal was intended to represent an eagle he was bitterly disappointed; and he insisted that the dr awing did not look like an eagle to him, and furthe rmore, an eagle was a bird of prey with few of the respectabl e qualities of the wild turkey. It has been said that the designer had drawn a Phoe nix. Its selection would of course have been appropriate. Among the ancients a fabulous bird called the Phoen ix is described by early writers such as Clement, Herodotus, and Pliny; in size and shape it resembl ed the eagle, but with certain differences. The bo dy of the Phoenix is one covered with glossy purple feathers, and the plumes in its tail are alternately blue an d red. The"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"head of the bird is light in color, and about its n eck is a circlet of golden plumage. At the back of its head the Phoenix has a crest of feathers of brilliant color. Only one of these birds was supposed to live at a time, with its home in the distant parts of Arabia, in a nest of f rankincense and myrrh. The Phoenix, it was said, l ives for 500 years, and at its death its body opens and the new born Phoenix emerges. Because of this symbolism, t he Phoenix is generally regarded as representing immor tality and resurrection. All symbols have their origin in something tangible , and the Phoenix is one sign of the secret orders of the ancient world and of the initiate of those orde rs, for it was common to refer to one who had been accepted into the temples as a man twice-born, or re-born. Wisdom confers a new life, and those who become wis e are born again. The Phoenix symbol is important in another way, as an emblem among nearly all civilized na tions of royalty, power, superiority, and immor tality. The Phoenix of China is identical in meaning with the Phoenix of Egypt; and the Phoenix of the Greeks is the same a s the Thunder Bird of the American Indians. In the accompanying drawing, the head of the bird a s it appeared on the great seal of 1782 is compared with the present form. It is immediately evident t hat the bird on the original seal is not an eagle, nor even a wild turkey as Franklin had hoped, but the Phoenix, the ancient symbol of human aspiration toward Univ ersal good. The beak is of a different shape, the neck i s much longer, and the small tuft of hair at the ba ck of the head leaves no doubt as to the artist's intention. But if this design on the obverse side of the seal is stamped with the signature of the Order of the Q uest, the design on the reverse is even more definitely r elated to the old Mysteries. Here is represented the great pyramid of Gizah, com posed of 13 rows of masonry, showing 72 stones. The pyramid is without a cap stone, and above its u pper platform floats a triangle containing the All- Seeing Eye surrounded by rays of light. This design was not pleasing to Professor Charles E liot Norton, of Harvard; he summed up his displeasure in the following words. \"The device ad opted by Congress is practically incapable of effec tive treatment; it can hardly (however artistically tre ated by the designer) look otherwise than as a dull emblem of a Masonic Fraternity.\" The quotation is from The History of the Seal of the United States . If incapable of artistic treatment, the great seal is susceptible of profound interpretation. The Pyr amid of Gizah was believed by the ancient Egyptians to be t he shrine tomb of the god Hermes, or Thot, the personification of Universal Wisdom. No trace has ever been found of the cap of the grea t pyramid. A flat platform about thirty feet squar e gives no indication that this part of the structure was ever otherwise finished; and this is appropri ate, as the Pyramid represents human society itself, imperfect and incomplete. The structure's ascending convergi ng angles and faces represent the common aspiration of humankind; above floats the symbol of the esoteri c orders, the radiant triangle with its all-seeing ey e. The triangle itself is in the shape of the Gree k letter D, the Delta, the first letter of the name of God--the div ine part of nature completing the works of men. The 72 stones are the 72 arrangements of the Tetrag rammaton, or the four-lettered name of God, in Hebrew. These four letters can be combined in 72 c ombinations, resulting in what is called the Shemhamforesh, which represents, in turn, the laws, powers, and energies of Nature by which the perfec tion of man is achieved. The Pyramid then is the Universal house, and above its unfinished apex is the radiant emblem of the Great Architect of the Universe. There is a legend that in the lost Atlantis stood a great university in which originated most of the a rts and sciences of the present race. The University w as in the form of an immense pyramid with many gall eries and corridors, and on the top was an observatory fo r the study of the stars. This temple to the scien ces in the old Atlantis is shadowed forth in the seal of the n ew Atlantis. Was it the society of the unknown phi losophers who scaled the new nation with the eternal emblems, that all the nations might know the purpose for wh ich the new country had been founded ? The obverse of the great seal has been used by the Department of State since 1782, but the reverse was not cut at that time because it was regarded as a s ymbol of a secret society and not the proper device for a sovereign State. Quite rare are discoveries of the use of this symbol in any important form until rec ent years. Most American citizens learned for the first time w hat was the design on the reverse of their seal whe n it appeared on the dollar bill, series of 1935A. So far as anyone may know, the use of the seal in 1 935 was probably without premeditation or special implication. But it is interesting that its appear ance should coincide with great changes affecting d emocracy in"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"all parts of the world. As early as 1935 the long shadows of a world tyranny had extended themselves across the surface of the globe. Democracy was on the thr eshold of its most severe testing. The rights of m an, that Thomas Paine defended, were being assailed on every hand by selfishness, ambition, and tyranny. Then on the common medium of our currency appeared the eternal emblem of our purpose. The combination of the Phoenix, the pyramid, and th e all-seeing eye is more than chance or coincidence. There is nothing about the early stru ggles of the colonists to suggest such a selection to farmers, shopkeepers, and country gentlemen. There is only one possible origin for these symbols, and that is the secret societies which came to this country 150 years befo re the Revolutionary War. Most of the patriots who achieved American independence belonged to these so cieties, and derived their inspiration, courage, an d high purpose from the ancient teaching. There can be no question that the great seal was directly inspired by these orders of the human Quest, and that it set forth th e purpose far this nation as that purpose was seen and known to the Founding Fathers. The monogram of the new Atlantis reveals this conti nent as set apart for the accomplishment of the great work--here is to arise the pyramid of human a spiration, the school of the secret sciences. Over this nation rules the supreme king, the Ever Living God. This nation is dedicated to the fulfillment of the Divin e Will. To the degree that men realize this, and dedicate them selves and their works to this purpose, their land will flourish. To depart from the symbol of this high d estiny is to be false to the great trust given as a priceless inheritance."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" 19 THE PROPHETIC DREAM OF GENERAL MC CLELLAN In a dark hour of military apprehension the General of the Union forces was visited by a vision in a dream. A voice spoke and a map came alive wit h troop movements as the enemy forces moved into the very positions h e had intended to occupy. The voice told him that he had been betrayed; he r aised his eyes and looked into the face of George Washington ... When McClellan awoke his m ap was covered with marks and signs and figures, indicating the strategy that prevented the capture of the nation's Capitol. ... Also included in the dream was the warning of t he Father of Our Country that we would wage still another struggle for exist ence \"ere another century shall have gone by\" again st the \"oppressors of the whole earth.\" T HE vision of Constantine changed the course of the Ro man Empire. The visions of Joan of Arc preserved France in an hour of darkest need. And t he vision that came to General McClellan was a powe rful force in preserving the Union of the American peopl e. The story of General McClellan's dream, preserved i n the General's own words, seems to have appeared in print for the first time in the Portland (Maine) , Evening Courier , of March 8, 1862. Had the story not been true, it is almost certain that McClellan himself w ould have made some statement of disproval or deman ded a retraction. General McClellan's career as a soldier was not exc eptionally brilliant; he was a good organizer, but made many enemies because of certain fixations of t emperament; but there can be no question of his si ncerity and his dedication to the cause of the Union. In t he interests of brevity here we will give a digest of parts of the story of the dream, with the General's own words pr eserved in the more significant passages. At two o'clock of the third night after General McC lellan's arrival at Washington, D.C., to take command of the United States Army, he was working o ver his maps and studying the reports of scouts. A feeling of intense weariness came over him, and lea ning his forehead on his folded arm he fell asleep at his table. He had not been sleeping more than ten minu tes when it seemed that the locked door of his room was suddenly thrown open, and someone strode up to him and in a voice terrible with power spoke: \"General McClellan, do you sleep at your post ? Rouse you, or ere it can be prevented, the foe will be in Wash ington.\" The General then describes in some detail his stran ge feeling. At the moment he seemed to be suspended in the center of infinite space, and the voice came from a hollow distance all about him. H e started up, but whether he was really awake he was never ab le to decide. The table covered with maps was stil l before him, but the furniture, the walls of the room, and other familiar objects were no longer visible. Ins tead, he was gazing upon a living map including the entire area of the country from the Mississippi river to the At lantic ocean. McClellan tried to see the features of the being th at stood with him, but could discern nothing but a vapor having the general outline of a man. As he looked upon the great map, McClellan was amaz ed to see the movements of the various troops and regiments, and a complete pattern of the enemy' s lines and distribution of forces. The General wa s immediately infused with a great elation, for he fe lt that the movements on this extraordinary map wou ld enable him to bring the war to a speedy and victorious ter mination. Then his elation changed to great apprehension, he saw the enemy's forces moving to certain points which he himself had intended to occupy within the next few days. He quietly realized that in some wa y his plans were known to the enemy. Then again the voice spoke. \"General McClellan, yo u have been betrayed. And had God not willed otherwise, ere the sun of tomorrow had set the Conf ederate flag would have waved above the Capitol and your own grave. But note what you see. Your time is sh ort.\" His pencil moving with the speed of thought, McClel lan transferred the troop positions from the living map to the paper map on his desk. When this had be en done, McClellan became aware that the figure sta nding near him had increased in light and glory until it shone like the noonday sun. And as he raised his e yes he looked into the face of George Washington."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"The first President with sublime and gentle dignity looked upon the bewildered officer, and spoke as follows: \"General McClellan, while yet in the fles h I beheld the birth of the American Republic.

This i s by far the most perilous ordeal she has to endure; passin g as she is from childhood to opening maturity, she is called on to accomplish that vast result, self-conquest; to learn that important lesson, self-control, self rule, that in the future will place her in the van of power and civil ization ... \"But her mission will not then be finished; for er e another century shall have gone by, the oppressors of the whole earth, hating and envying her exaltation, shall join themselves together and raise up their hands against her. But if she still be found worthy of h er high calling they shall surely be discomfited, a nd then will be ended her third and last great struggle for existence. Thencefort h shall the Republic go on, increasing in power and goodness, until her borders shall end onl y in the remotest corners of the earth, and the who le earth shall beneath her shadowing wing become a Universal Republic. Let her in her prosperity, however, rem ember the Lord her God, her trust be always in Him, and s he shall never be confounded.\" As the spirit visitor ceased speaking he raised his hand over McClellan's head in blessing, and the ne xt instant a peal of thunder rumbled through space. M cClellan woke with a start. He was again in his ro om with his maps spread out on the table before him. But there was one difference; the maps were covere d with the marks, signs, and figures which he had inscribed there during the vision. McClellan walked about the room to convince himself that he was really awake. He then returned and looked at the maps. The markings were still there. Convinced now that the experience was heaven sent, McClellan had his horse saddled and rode from camp to camp making the necessary changes in his st rategy to meet the enemy's planned offensive. His moves were successful, and he prevented the cap ture of the city of Washington. At that time the Confederate Army was so close that Abraham Lincoln, sitting in his study at the White House, could hea r the rumble of the Confederate artillery. General McClellan concludes his account of the stra nge vision that saved the Union with these words: \"Our beloved, glorious Washington shall again rest quietly, sweetly in his tomb, until perhaps the end of the Prophetic Century approaches that is to bring the R epublic to a third and final struggle, when he may once more, laying aside the crements of Mount Vernon, be came a Messenger of Succor and Peace from the Great Ruler, who has all the Nations of the Earth in his keeping. \"But the future is too vast for our comprehension; we are the children of the present. When peace sh all again have folded her bright wings and settled upon our land, the strange, unearthly map marked while the Spirit eyes of Washington looked down, shall be pre served among American archives, as a precious remin der to the American nation of what in their second great s truggle for existence, they owe to God and the Glor ified Spirit of Washington. Verily the works of God are above the understanding of man !\" It is not difficult to understand how a man who has been granted so strange an experience should come to realize that a secret destiny is overshadowing t he country for which he fought. The prophetic import contained in the vision is now apparent, and as the entire account was published in 1862 there can be no doubt that we are in the prese nce of a genuine example of foreknowledge. It is n ow 80 years since Washington appeared to General McClella n, and within the century the powers of the earth h ave risen to destroy the concept of world democracy. A merica is in the vanguard of the democratic nations , seeking to preserve its heritage from the encroachments of totalitarian powers. Already it is obvious that in the postwar period of reconstruction America must become a lead er of nations in the establishment of a commonwealt h of peoples. The purpose for which we are created is r evealing itself through the long processes of time, and that purpose is indeed our most sacred heritage. It is written in the old books that when the brothe rs of the Quest desire to bring about changes in th e mortal state they send messengers and strange dream s and mystic visions and, accomplish their purpose by revealing their will to the leaders of nations in s undry and curious ways.

The power of man lies in his dreams, his visions, and his ideals. This has been the com mon vision of man's necessity in the secret empire of the Brotherhood of the Ques t, consecrated to fulfilling the destiny for which we in America w ere brought into being. Religion, science, and philosophy are the three par ts of essential learning. A government based upon o ne or even two of these parts must ultimately degenerate into a tyranny, either of men or opinion. These three realize the unity of knowl edge; they are the orders of the Quest P HILOSOPHY teaches that the completion of the great work of s ocial regeneration must be accomplished not in society but in man himself. The democratic commonwealth can never be legislated into existence. Nor can it result from formal treaties or conferences. This is clearly indicated in the tragedy of the League of Nations. The Leag ue failed to prevent war because the nations which composed the League lacked the courage of high conviction; they failed the very institution which they themselves had esta blished. Permanent progress results from education, and not from legislation. The true purpose of education is to inform the mind in basic truths concerning conduct and the consequences of conduct. Education is not merely the fitting of the individual for the problems of e conomic survival. This is only the lesser part of learning. The greater part deals with the intangibles of righ t motivation and right use. No human being who is moved to action through wrong motivations, or misus es the privileges of his times, can be regarded as educated, regardless of the amount of formal schooling he has received. The human mind is established in knowledge not alon e by the reading of books or the study of arts and sciences, but by the examples set up by leaders and the personal experiences of living. According to the Baconian system, there are three sources of learnin g. The first is tradition, which may be derived fr om books. The second is observation, by which we learn from t he actions of each other. And the third is by experimentation, which is a study of causes and con sequences brought about by personal conduct. The supreme human purpose is the perfection of man. This must come first, and when this end has been achieved all good things will inevitably follow. Only enlightened men can sustain enlightened leader ship; only the wise can recognize and reward wisdom. In a democratic way of life the very survival of th e State depends upon the intelligent cooperation of its people. Where men make their own laws, they must l ive according to the merits and demerits of the sta tutes which they have framed. The Greek law giver, Solon, declared that in the id eal State laws are few and simple, because they hav e been derived from certainties. In the corrupt Stat e, laws are many and confused, because they have be en derived from uncertainties. These corrupt laws are like the web of a spider which catches small insec ts but permits the stronger creatures to break through and escape. Where there are many laws there is much lawlessness , and men come to despise and ridicule the restraints that are imposed upon freedom of action. Corrupt laws, resulting from efforts to amend ina dequate legislation by further inadequate legislation, reve al a general ignorance of right and wrong. Where s uch ignorance exists the ideal function of democracy is impossible, and liberty degenerates into license. The half-truth is the most dangerous form of lie, b ecause it can be defended in part by incontestable logic. Wherever the body of learning is broken up, the fragments become partial truths. We live in a day of partial truths; and until we remedy the condition we must suffer the inevitable consequences of divis ion. According to the Ancients, religion, philosophy, an d science are the three parts of essential learning . Not one of these parts is capable if separated from the rest, of assuring the security of the human st ate. A government based upon one or even two of these part s must ultimately degenerate into a tyranny, either of men or of opinion."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Religion is the spiritual part of learning, philoso phy the mental part, and the sciences, including th e arts and crafts, the physical part. As man himself has a spiritual, mental, and physical nature, and all o f these natures manifest in his daily living, he must becom e equally informed in all the parts of his nature i f he is to be self-governing. \"Unbalanced forces perish in the v oid,\" declared a prophet of old; and this is true beyond possibility of dispute. The Platonic commonwealth had as its true foundatio n the unity of learning. In the midst of the philosophic empire stands the school of the three-f old truth. Religion is the quest of truth by means of the mystical powers latent in the consciousness of man. Philosophy is the quest for truth by the extensio n of the intellectual powers toward the substance of reality . Science is the quest for truth by the study of t he anatomy and the physiology of the body of truth, as it is r evealed in the material creation. These three, then, are the orders of the Quest. To gether they can bring about the perfection of man through the discovery of the Plan for man. One of the great secrets of antiquity was this real ization of the unity of knowledge and the identity of the Quest in all the branches of learning. The gre at philosophers of the past were truly great becaus e they approached the problem of life as priest-philosophe r-scientist. The title \"The Wise\" is properly appl ied only to those in whose consciousness the unity of knowledge has been established as the pattern of the Quest. It was part of the ancient plan that has descended to us to build again the ideal university--the coll ege of the six days work. Here would be taught the same a rts and sciences that we teach today, but from a di fferent basic premise. Here men would learn that the scien ces are as sacred as the theologies, and the philos ophies are as practical as the crafts and trades. Those mysti cal extra-sensory perceptions viewed with suspicion by the materialist would then be developed according to th e disciplines of the sciences, and all learning wou ld be consecrated to the supreme end that men become as t he gods, knowing good and evil. This university is the beginning of democratic empi re. No longer would it be a secret school--the Hou se of the Unknown Philosophers. It would emerge from the clouds which have concealed it from the profane for thousands of years and take its rightful place as t he center and fountain-head of the Ever Living Good . When humanity willfully ignores the Universal laws which govern its destiny, Nature has devious ways of pressing home its lessons. Civilization after c ivilization has been built up by human courage and destroyed by human ignorance. We stand again on the threshol d of a great decision. Once more the workings of t ime have revealed the weaknesses of our social structur e. Once more we have come to a day of reckoning. In the postwar world one of two courses lies before us. Either we will make the old mistakes again, a nd try to force our own concepts upon the Universe; o r we will gather our strength for one heroic effort to put things right. If we make the old mistakes we will be rewarded by the old pain. But if we make the new effort, we can set up imperishable footings and bestow as a he ritage the beginnings of a better way of life. Acc ording to our choice the results will be in evitable, for Nat ure will never change her ways. Let us consider he r ways and be wise. Centuries ago, one of the secret masters of the Que st wrote: \"The Eternal Good reveals its will and pleasure through the body of Nature and the motions of Universal Law. Within the body of Nature and L aw there is a soul which must be discovered by great t houghtfulness. And within that soul of Nature and Law there is a spirit which must be sought with great underst anding; for verily I say unto you, my brothers, th at it is this spirit concealed from the profane but revealed to t he thoughtful, which giveth life.\" This, then, is the design of our foundations: that men shall abide together in peace and shall devote their energies to the common cause of discovery. Man is greater than the animal, not in strength of body, nor in shrewdness, nor in the power of his senses, nor even in skill and patience; man is supe rior because he contains within himself the faculti es and powers by which he can perceive his true place in a divine order of life. His power lies in his dreams, his visions, and his ideals. If these intangibles are left uncultivated , man is at best but a superior kind of beast, subject to al l the ills and vicissitudes of an unenlightened cre ation. But, as man has locked within him, hidden from the public gaze, this diviner part, so it is true that human society has within itself concealed from our common view a nobler part composed of the idealists and dreamers of all ages and of all races who have been bound together by their common vision of man's nec essity. This is the secret empire of the poets, this is the order of the Unknown Philosophers, this is the Bro therhood of the Quest."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"And never will these dreamers cease their silent wo rking until that dream is perfected in our daily li fe.
