The vul nerability of these infrastruc tures to threat s — deliberate, accidental, and acts of nature — is the focus of greatly height ened concern in the current era, a process accelerated by the events of 9/11 and recent hurricanes, including Katrina and Rita. This report presents the results of the Comm ission’s assessment of the effects of a high altitude electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack on our critical national infrastructures and provides recommendations for their mitigation. The assessment is informed by analytic and test activities executed under Commission sponsorship, which are discussed in this volume. An earlier executive report, Report of the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Puls e (EMP) — Volume 1: Executive Report (2004) , provided an overview of the subject. The electromagnetic pulse generated by a high altitude nuclear explosion is one of a small number of threats that can hold our society at risk of catastrophic consequences. The increasingly pervasive use of electronics of all forms represents the greatest source of vulnerability to attack by EMP. Electroni cs are used to control, communicate, com- pute, store, manage, and implement nearly ever y aspect of United States (U.S.) civilian systems. When a nuclear explosion occurs at high altitude, the EMP signal it produces will cover the wide geographic region within the line of sight of the detonation. 1 This broad band, high amplitude EMP, when coupled into sensitive electronics, has the capa- bility to produce widespread and long lasting disruption a nd damage to the critical infrastructures that underpin the fabric of U.S. society. Because of the ubiquitous dependence of U. S. society on the electrical power system, its vulnerability to an EMP attack, coupled with the EMP’s particular damage mecha- nisms, creates the possibility of long-term, catastrophic consequences. The implicit invi- tation to take advantage of this vulnerability, when coupled with increasing proliferation of nuclear weapons and their delivery systems, is a serious concern. A single EMP attack may seriously degrade or shut down a large pa rt of the electric power grid in the geo- graphic area of EMP exposure effectively inst antaneously. There is also a possibility of functional collapse of grids beyond the exposed ar ea, as electrical effects propagate from one region to another. The time required for full recovery of serv ice would depend on both the disruption and damage to the electrical power infrastructure and to other national infrastructures. Larger affected areas and stronger EMP field strengt hs will prolong the time to recover. Some critical electrical power infr astructure components are no longer manufactured in the United States, and their acquisiti on ordinarily requires up to a y ear of lead time in routine circumstances. Damage to or loss of these components could leave significant parts of the electrical infrastructure out of service for pe riods measured in months to a year or more. There is a point in time at which the shortage or exhaustion of sust aining backup systems,   1 For example, a nuclear explosion at an altitude of 100 kilometers would expose 4 m illion square kilometers, about 1.5 million square miles, of Earth surface beneath the burst to a range of EMP field intensities."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Preface vii including emergency power supplies, batter ies, standby fuel supplies, communications, and manpower resources that can be mobiliz ed, coordinated, and dispatched, together lead to a continuing degradati on of critical infrastructures for a prolonged period of time. Electrical power is necessary to support othe r critical infrastructures, including supply and distribution of water, food, fuel, communi cations, transport, financial transactions, emergency services, government services, a nd all other infrastructures supporting the national economy and welfare. Should signif icant parts of the el ectrical power infra- structure be lost for any subs tantial period of time, the Comm ission believes that the con- sequences are likely to be catastrophic, a nd many people may ultimately die for lack of the basic elements necessary to sustain life in dense urban and suburban communities. In fact, the Commission is deeply concerned that su ch impacts are likely in the event of an EMP attack unless practical step s are taken to provide protecti on for critical elements of the electric system and for ra pid restoration of electric powe r, particularly to essential services. The recovery plans for the indivi dual infrastructures currently in place essen- tially assume, at worst, limited upsets to the other infrastructures that are important to their operation. Such plans may be of little or no value in the wake of an EMP attack because of its long-duration e ffects on all infrastructures th at rely on electricity or electronics. The ability to recover from this situation is an area of great concern. The use of auto- mated control systems has allowed many compan ies and agencies to operate effectively with small work forces. Thus, while manual c ontrol of some systems may be possible, the number of people knowledgeable enough to support manual operations is limited. Repair of physical damage is also constrained by a small work force. Many maintenance crews are sized to perform routine and preventive maintenance of high-reliability equipment. When repair or replacement is required that exceeds routine levels, arrangements are typically in place to augment crews from outsi de the affected area. However, due to the simultaneous, far-reaching effects from EMP, th e anticipated augmenters likely will be occupied in their own areas. Thus, repairs nor mally requiring weeks of effort may require a much longer time than planned. The consequences of an EMP event should be prepared for and prot ected against to the extent it is reasonably po ssible. Cold War-style deterre nce through mutual assured destruction is not likely to be an effective threat against potentia l protagonists that are either failing states or trans-national groups. Therefore, making preparations to manage the effects of an EMP attack, including understanding what has happened, maintaining situational awareness, having plans in place to recover, challenging and exercising those plans, and reducing vulnerabil ities, is critical to reduci ng the consequences, and thus probability, of attack. The appropriate nationa l-level approach should balance prevention, protection, and recovery. The Commission requested and received info rmation from a number of Federal agen- cies and National Laboratories. We received information from the North American Elec- tric Reliability Corporation, the Presid ent’s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee, the National Communi cations System (since absorbed by the Department of Homeland Security), the Fe deral Reserve Board, and the Department of Homeland Security. Early in this review it became apparent that only limited EMP vulnerability testing had been accomplis hed for modern electronic systems and components. To partially remedy this defi cit, the Commission s ponsored illustrative"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Preface viii testing of current systems and infrastructure components. The Commission’s view is that the Federal Government does not today have sufficiently robust capab ilities for reliably assessing and managing EMP threats. The United States faces a long-term challe nge to maintain technical competence for understanding and managing the effects of nuclear weapons, including EMP. The Department of Energy and the National Nuclea r Security Administration have developed and implemented an extensive Nuclear Weapon s Stockpile Stewardshi p Program over the last decade. However, no compar able effort was initiated to understand the effects that nuclear weapons produce on modern systems. The Commission reviewed current national capabilities to understand and to manage the effects of EMP and concluded that the Country is rapidly losing the technical comp etence in this area that it needs in the Government, National Laboratorie s, and Industrial Community. An EMP attack on the national civilian infras tructures is a serious problem, but one that can be managed by coordinated and focused efforts between industr y and government. It is the view of the Commission that managing the adverse impacts of EMP is feasible in terms of time and resources. A serious national commitment to address the threat of an EMP attack can develop a national posture th at would significantly reduce the payoff for such an attack and allow the United States to r ecover in a timely manner if such an attack were to occur.

The vul nerability of these infrastruc tures to threat s — deliberate, accidental, and acts of nature — is the focus of heightened concern in the current era, a process accelerated by the events of 9/11 a nd recent hurricanes, including Katrina and Rita. This volume focuses on a description of the potential vulnerabilities of our critical national infrastructures to electromagnetic puls e (EMP) insult, and to that end, the chap- ters in this document deal individually with the EMP threat to each cr itical infrastructure separately. However, to set the stage for understa nding the potential threat under condi- tions in which all infrastructures are under si multaneous attack, it is important to realize that the vulnerability of the whole — of all the highly interlocked critical infrastructures — may be greater than the sum of the vulnera bility of its parts. The whole is a highly complex system of systems whose exceedi ngly dynamic and coordinated activity is enabled by the growth of technology and wher e failure within one individual infrastruc- ture may not remain isolated but, inst ead, induce cascading fa ilures into other infrastructures. It is also important to understand that not only mutual interdepen dence, and hence new vulnerabilities, may be enabled by technology a dvances, but also technologies that have facilitated this growing interdependence ma y be common across th e many individual infrastructures. In particular, the Commission thought it important to single out the growth and common infrastructural infiltration of one particular transformative technology, the development of automated mon itoring and control systems — the ubiquitous robots of the modern age known as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. This opening chapter thus focuses on a more detailed description of these two aspects of modern infrastructures, c ontrol systems and mutual interdependence, that are common to all and which the Commission believes pr ovide context and in sight for understanding sources of vulnerability in all the Nation’s infrastructures to EMP attack. SCADA Systems Introduction SCADAs have emerged as critical and grow ing elements of a qui etly unfolding indus- trial revolution spurred by the computer ag e. The accelerating pe netration of SCADA systems, along with their electronic cousins, digital control syst ems (DCS) and program- mable logic controllers (PLC), as critical elem ents in every aspect of every critical infra- structure in the Nation, is both inevitabl e and inexorable. While conferring economic benefit and enormous new operational agility, the growing dependence of our infrastruc- tures on these omnipresent contro l systems represents a new vect or of vulnerability in the evolving digital age of the 21s t century, such as cyber security. Such issues remain as a matter for high-level concern and attention today. High-altitude EMP focuses our atten- tion toward another potential vulnerability of these system s, and one with potentially vastly expanded consequences."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 1. Infrastructure Commonalities 2 What Is a SCADA? SCADAs are electronic control systems that may be used for data acquisition and control over large and geographically distributed infras tructure systems. They find extensive use in critical infrastructure a pplications such as electrica l transmission and distribution, water management, and oil and gas pipeli nes. SCADA technology has benefited from several decades of development. It has its genesis in the telemetry systems used by the railroad and aviation industries.   In November 1999, San Diego County Water Authority and San Diego Gas and Electric companies experienced severe electromagnetic interference to their SCADA wireless networks. Both companies found themselves unable to actuate critical valve openings and closings under remote control of the SCADA electronic systems. This inability necessitate d sending technicians to remote locations to manually open and close water and gas valves, averting, in the words of a subsequent letter of complaint by the San Diego County Water Authority to the Federal Communications Commission, a potential “catastrophic failure” of the aqueduct system. The potential consequences of a failure of this 825 million gallon per day flow rate system ranged from “spilling vents at thousands of gallons per minute to aqueduct rupture with en suing disruption of service, severe flooding, and related damage to private and public property.” The source of the SCADA failure was later determined to be radar operated on a ship 25 miles off the coast of San Diego. The physical form of a SCADA may differ fr om application to application and from one industry to another, but generally they all share certain ge neric commonalities. A SCADA system physically bears close resembla nce to the internals of a generic desktop personal computer. Typically, it might contain familiar-appearing circuit boards, chips of various sorts, and cable connectors to the ex ternal world. The cable connectors, in turn, may be connected, perhaps quite remotely, to various sensor systems that are the SCADA’s eyes and ears, as well as electr onic control devices by which the SCADA may issue commands that adjust system performance. Figure 1-1 provides an example of a particular SCADA controller that is representative of many such systems. Figure 1-1. Typical SCADA Architecture"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 1. Infrastructure Commonalities 3 One major function of a SCADA — the data acquisition part of the acronym — is to provide a capability to automatically and re motely monitor the opera ting state of a physi- cal system. It accomplishes this monito ring by providing an ongoing reporting of parameters that either characterize the system ’s performance, such as voltage or currents developed in an electric power plant, flow volume in a gas pipeline, and net electrical power delivered or received by a regional el ectrical system, or by monitoring environ- mental parameters such as temperature in a nuclear power plant and sending an alarm when prescribed operating conditions are exceeded. The supervisory control function of a SCADA reflects the ability of these devices to actively control the operation of the system by adjusting its output. For example, should an electrical generating plant fail through loss of a critical hardware component or indus- trial accident, the monitoring SCADA will detect the loss, issue an alert to the appropriate authorities, and issue commands to other gene rating plants under its control to increase their power output to match the load again. All these actions take place automatically, within seconds, and without a human bei ng involved in the immediate control loop. A typical SCADA architecture for the electri c power industry may consist of a central- ized computer — the master terminal unit (MTU) — communicating through many remote terminal unit (RTU) subsystems, as illustrated in figure 1-2 . The RTUs are used in remote, unmanned locations where data acquisition and control tasks must be per- formed. Examples of typical RTU data acquisition actions include processing signals from sensors such as thermocouples, voltage sensors, or power meters and reporting the state of equipment such as switch and circuit breaker posi tions. Typical control actions include starting and stopping motors and c ontrolling valves and circuit breakers. Figure 1-2. Generi c SCADA Architecture DCSs share many functional and physical hard ware similarities with SCADA systems. A DCS typically will be used to control automa ted processes at a sing le location, such as"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 1. Infrastructure Commonalities 4 an oil refinery or a chemical plant. In contrast, a SCADA typically might be sited in an environment with dispersed assets where re al-time situational awareness from remote locations is a key element of centralized cont rol. Most DCS installations control complex, dynamic systems that would be difficult or impo ssible to control in a safe or economical manner using only manual control. Even a relatively straightforward process su ch as electrical power generation using a conventional steam cycle requires highly comple x systems to maximize efficiency, while maintaining safety and environmental protection. For example, control systems in a steam generating plant would include parameters such as generator speed, generator lubrication oil pressure, exci tation current and voltage outp ut, feed water pressure and boiler steam drum level, and air box pressure and rate of combustion. Upset of these control points has the potenti al to cause severe physical damage. A case in point is the boiler endpoints of combusti on and circulation. Normally, the control sys- tem would first reach the endpoint of combusti on (limit of air and fu el adding energy into the boiler) and, thus, prev ent any thermal damage to the bo iler. If the control system is upset, it potentially could reach the endpoint of circulation (maximum rate of steam gen- eration) or endpoint of carryover (m aximum rate at which water is not carried out of the boiler) before the endpoint of combustion. This situation would cause thermal damage to the boiler tubes or physical dama ge to steam turbine blades. Normally, a PLC is used to control actuators or monitor sensors and is another piece of hardware that shares many physical similarities to SCADAs and is often found as part of a larger SCADA or DCS system. The SCADA , DCS, and PLC systems all share elec- tronic commonalities and, thus they share intr insic electronic vulnerabilities as well. SCADA systems, however, tend to be more geographically disposed and exposed; our subsequent discussion focuses on SCADAs. When exposure or unprotected cable con- nectivity is an issue, the discussion should be considered to pertai n to both PLC and DCS as well. See figure 1-3 . Figure 1-3. PLC Switch Actuator EMP Interaction with SCADA SCADA system components by th eir nature are frequently situated in remote environ- ments and operate without proximate human intervention. Although th eir critical elec- tronic elements usually are contained within some sort of metallic box, the enclosures’"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 1. Infrastructure Commonalities 5 service as a protective Faraday cage is typically minimal. Generally such metallic con- tainers are designed only to provide protec tion from the elements and a modicum of physical security. They typica lly are not designed to protec t the electronics from high- energy electromagnetic pulses that may infiltrat e either from the free field or from the many antennae (cable connections) that may compromise electromagnetic integrity. The major concern for SCADA vulnerability to EMP is focused on the early time E1 compo- nent of the EMP signal. This is because, even in the power industry, SCADA systems generally are not directly coupl ed electrically to th e very long cable ru ns that might be expected to couple to a late-time E3 signal. To come to grips with the potential vulnerabi lity of our critical national infrastructures caused by a threat to these ubi quitous SCADA control systems, we must first develop a sense of the vulnerability of the underlying hardware components themselves. To this end, the EMP Commission sponsored and funded a series of tests of common SCADA components in a government-owned EMP simulator (see figure 1-4 ). The simulation testing provided an opportunity to observe the interaction of the electromagnetic energy with equipment in an operational mode. Becau se the simulator did not completely repli- cate all characteristics of a threat-level EMP environment, observed test results can be related to the system’s response in more real istic scenarios through analysis and judgment based on coupling differences between the simulated and real-world cases. Figure 1-4. EMP Simulator with Test Structures and Internal Electronics The Commission consulted with experts fr om industry groups associated with the North American Electric Reliability Corporat ion (NERC) and by site and market surveys to identify representative cont rol systems for testing. A test matrix was developed that reflected electronic control technologies em ployed in power generation, power distribu- tion, pipeline distributio n, and manufacturing plants. Some test items assessed in this effort are shown in figure 1-5 ."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 1. Infrastructure Commonalities 6 Figure 1-5. Some of the Electronic Control Systems Exposed in Test Facility EMP Simulation Testing In this section, we provide a brief summary of the results of illuminating electronic control systems in the simulator. The detailed results of the simulation test program are documented separately in reports spons ored by the Commission. In Chapter 2, we provide a more complete desc ription of the test methodology, in which we discuss testing carried out during assessment of the EM P vulnerability of the electric grid. Many of the control systems that we cons idered achieved ope rational connectivity through Ethernet cabling. EMP coupling of electri cal transients to the cables proved to be an important vulnerability during threat il lumination. Because the systems would require manual repair, their full restor ation could be a lengthy proce ss. A simple model of four Ethernet cables from a router to four pers onal computers (PC) was generated to quantify the impact of cable length. The confi guration of this model is shown in figure 1-6 . The results of the analysis indicate that the coupling to the 200 fe et of Ethernet line is roughly seven times the transient level on the 25-foot line measured during the test program. The testing and analysis indicate that the electroni cs could be expected to see roughly 100 to 700 ampere current transients on typical Ethern et cables. Effects noted in the EMP testing occurred at the lower end of this scale. The bottom line observation at th e end of the testing was that every system tested failed when exposed to the simulated EMP environmen t. The failures were not identical from system to system or within a system. For example, a device with many input-output ports might exhibit degraded performance on one port, physical damage on another, and no effect on a third. Control units might report operating parameters at variance with their post illumination reality or fail to control in ternal flows. The Commission considered the implications of these multiple simultaneous co ntrol system failures to be highly signifi- cant as potential contributors to a widespread system collapse. Impact of SCADA Vulnerabilities on Critical Infrastructures: Historical Insight Based on the testing and analysis outlined in the previous section, we estimate that a significant fraction of all remote control sy stems within the EMP-affected area will "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 1.

Physical Model Used to Quantify Coupling to Different Cable Lengths in a Hypothetical Local Area Network (LAN) experience some type of impact. As the test results were briefed to industry experts at NERC and the Argonne National Laboratory, it b ecame apparent that even minor effects noted during the testing could significantly affect the processes and equipment being controlled. Putting together a complete analys is for complex processes associated with infrastructure systems is extremely difficult. Developing the ability to analyze or model these impacts is beyond the scope of this effort. To provide insight into the potential impact of these EM P-induced electronic system malfunctions, one can consider th e details of histori cal events. In these cases, similar (and arguably less severe) system ma lfunctions have produced conse quences in situations that are far too complex to predict befo rehand using a model or analysis. Another important observation is that these incidents are seldom the result of a single factor. Rather they are a combination of une xpected events that, only in hindsight, are easily related to the impact. This is not su rprising given the comple xity of the systems involved. Before considering the historical da tabase, it is important to remember that historical examples, although important for the insight they provide into the dependence of a functioning modern infrastructure on its automated eyes, ears, and remote control- lers, do not adequately capture the scale of the expected EMP scenario. In the latter, it is not one or a few SCADA systems that are ma lfunctioning (the typical historical sce- nario), but large numbers — hundreds or even thousands — with some fraction of those rendered permanently inoperable until re placed or physically repaired. Significant historical events th at provide insight into the pot ential impact of damage or upset to control systems include Hurricane Katrina; the 1996 Wester n States blackout; the August 14, 2003, Northeast blackout; a geomagnetic storm in 1989; the June 10, 1999, Bellingham pipeline incident; the August 19, 20 00, Carlsbad pipeline incident; the July 24, 1994, Pembroke, United Kingdom, refinery in cident; and a Netherlands electromag- netic interference (EMI) incident. The following paragraphs discuss th e relevance of four of these incidents to an EMP event. The other four incidents — Hurricane Katrina; the Western States blackout; the August 14, 2003, blackout; and the 1989 geomagnetic storm — are described in Chapter 2, which is dedi cated to a discussion of EMP effects on the electric power grid. Bellingham Pipeline Incident. On June 10, 1999, one of the Olympic pipelines trans- porting gasoline ruptured in the Whatcom Fa lls Park area of Bellingham, Washington. About 250,000 gallons of gasoline from the pi peline entered the Hannah and Whatcom Creeks, where the fuel ignited, resulting in th ree fatalities and eight injuries. In addition, the banks of the creek were destroyed over a 1.5-mile section, and several buildings adja- cent to the creek were severely damaged."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 1. Infrastructure Commonalities 8 Causes included improperly set relief valv es, delayed maintenance inspections, and SCADA system discrepancies. The effects all came together at the same time that changes in pipeline operations were occurri ng. Given the wide area of an EMP, it is con- ceivable that some of the pipelines affected could also suffer from poor maintenance. The electronic disturbance of an EMP event could be expected to precipitate SCADA failures and the ensuing loss of valve controls. Carlsbad Pipeline Incident. On August 19, 2000, an explosion occurred on one of three adjacent large natural gas pipelines near Ca rlsbad, New Mexico, operated by the El Paso Natural Gas Company. The pipelines supply cons umers and electric utilities in Arizona and Southern California. Twelve people, includ ing five children, died as a result of the explosion. The explosion left an 86-foot-long crater. Afte r the pipeline failure, the Department of Transportation’s Office of Pipe line Safety (OPS) ordered the pipeline to be shut down. The explosion happened because of failures in maintenance and loss of situational awareness, conditions that would be replicated by data acquisition disruptions caused by an EMP event. Pembroke Refinery Incident. On July 24, 1994, a severe thunderstorm passed over the Pembroke refinery in the United Kingdom. Lightning strikes resulted in a 0.4 second power loss and subsequent power dips thr oughout the refinery. Consequently, numerous pumps and overhead fin-fan cool ers tripped repeatedly, resulting in the main crude col- umn pressure safety valves lifting and major ups ets in the process units in other refinery units, including those within the flui d catalytic cracking (FCC) complex. There was an explosion in the FCC unit and a number of isolated fires continued to burn at locations within the FCC, butamer , and alkylation units. The explosion was caused by flammable hydrocarbon liquid continu ously being pumped into a process ves- sel that, because of a valve malfunction, had it s outlet closed. The control valve was actu- ally shut when the control system indicated that it was open. The malfunctioning process control system did not allow the refinery operators to contain the situation. As a result of this incident, an estimated 10 percent of the total refining capacity in the United Kingdom was lost until this complex was returned to service. The business loss is estimated at $70 million, which reflects 4.5 months of downtime. The disturbances caused by the lightning strikes — power loss and degradation — would also result from an EMP event. Netherlands EMI Incident. A mishap occurred at a natural gas pipeline SCADA system located about 1 mile from the port of Den Helder, Netherlands, in the late 1980s. A SCADA disturbance caused a catastrophic failu re of an approximately 36-inch diameter pipeline, which resulted in a large gas explosion. This failure was caused by EMI traced to a radar coupling into the wires of the SCADA system. Radio frequency energy caused the SC ADA system to open and close at the radar scan frequency, a relay that was, in turn, controlling the position of a large gas flow- control valve. The resulting changes in va lve position created pressure waves that traveled down the pipeline and eventually caused the pipeline to fail. This incident shows the potential damage to pipelines from improper control system operations, a condition that could be replicated by an EMP event."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 1. Infrastructure Commonalities 9 Summary SCADA systems are vulnerable to EMP insult. The large numbers and widespread reli- ance on such systems by all of the Nation’s cr itical infrastructures represent a systemic threat to their continued operation following an EMP event. Additionally, the necessity to reboot, repair, or replace larg e numbers of geographically wi dely dispersed systems will considerably impede the Nation’s re covery from such an assault. Infrastructures and Their Interdependencies Introduction All critical national infrastructures are fau lt tolerant to some degree. Design engineers and system managers are cognizant of, and fully expect, failure of subsystems and indi- vidual electrical components. Networks are desi gned with an expressed goal to avoid sin- gle point failures that can bring down the entire system, though in practice the evolved network may be so complicated that no one can guarantee that this design goal has been achieved. Single point failures are anticipated in the design of the systems and engineer- ing solutions of various kinds, including redundancy, rapid repair, replacement, and operational rerouting. It is important to note, however, that safegua rds against single point failures generally depend on the proper functioning of the rest of the national infrastructure, a plausible assumption for high-reliability infrastructur e systems when they experience random, uncorrelated single point failures. Planning for multiple failures, particularly when they are closely correlated in time, is much less common. It is safe to say that no one has planned for, and few have even imagined, a scenario with the loss of hundred s or even thousands of nodes across all the critical national infrastructures, all simulta neously. That, however, is precisely the cir- cumstance contemplated by an EMP attack scenario. The ability to predict the consequences of failure within a critical infrastructure will require the use of reliable modeling and simulation tools. Some tools exist for the individual infrastr uctures and serve as either planning tools, real-time control models, or operationa l support elements to allocate or control resources during network outages and restoration activities. They are generally validated within the pa rameter space of normal operating experience and concern, and they serve their purposes well . But it is also recognized that the systems being modeled are so complex that currently available modeling to ols cannot capture the full richness of potential system responses to all possible network configurations and operating states. Thus, for example, on the order of once a deca de or so, portions of the national power grid will experience an unpredicted major di sruption with failures cascading through some of the network pathways. Following th e major Northeast power blackout of August 14, 2003, analysts continued to debate the ca use of the disruption. The sophisticated, relatively mature, and operationally deploye d modeling and simulation tools have not been able to replicate unambiguously the observed events of August 14.   “We have produced designs so compli- cated that we cannot possibly anticipate all the possible interactions of the inevi- table failures; we add safety devices that are deceived or avoided or defeated by hidden paths in the systems.” Charles Perrow, Normal Accidents "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 1. Infrastructure Commonalities 10 The scenarios envisioned by an EMP attack in volve potential failures distributed across a wide geographical extent. These include mu ltiple combinations of node failures, a con- dition that generally is outside the parameter space of validation of extant system models and poses a severe challenge to predicting the subsequent evolution of the infrastructure response. The response of critical national infra structures to an EMP attack is precisely the subject of many sections of this report. But there is a particular aspect of modeling infrastructures that is even less well developed and whose particular relevance to the EMP scenario stresses the current state of the simulation art to produce a high-fidelity simulation. That aspect is the interaction among the different infrastructures. Particularly difficult to anticipate and to capture in simula tions are situations in which the occurrence of simultaneous failures can bring into play dormant and hitherto hidden interaction pathways in which a destructively synergistic amplification of failure, normally locally contained, may be propagated th rough the network at large. Charles Perrow 1 in particular has drawn attention to these types of failures, which he has termed normal accidents and which are posited as an in herent property of any tightly coupled system once a threshold of co mplexity has been passed. The Commission believes that, given sufficient priority, time and resources, comple x interdependent mod- els can be developed to guide future assessmen ts of the U.S. national infrastructure to EMP attack and to guide invest ment decisions on how best to protect our infrastructures. Complex Interactions Various lists are in circulation that identif y the critical infrastructures. The EMP Com- mission has chosen to address the following ar eas in separate sections of this Com- mission report:  Electric power  Telecommunications  Banking and finance  Petroleum and natural gas  Transportation  Food  Water  Emergency services  Space  Government The separation of these infrastructures into different domains tends to obscure the real interdependencies that sustain the effec tiveness and daily oper ation of each one. As a simple example, the telecommunications infrastructure requires power that is delivered by the power infrastr ucture. If power delivery is disrupted by disturbances in the power grid, telecommunication substations will run for a while on reserve battery power but would then need to switch to reserve b ackup generators (if they have them). The generator’s operation would rely on fuel, first from on-site storage and then con- veyed to a central distribution point by the energy distribution infrastructure and deliv- ered to the telecommunications substation by the transportation infr astructure and paid for by the components of the financial infr astructure. The technicians who show up,   1 Perrow, Charles, Normal Accidents, Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J., 1999."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 1. Infrastructure Commonalities 11 through the transportation infrastructure, to make repairs would not do so unless they have been sustained by the food and water delivery infrastructures, and so forth. In turn, a functioning telecommunications system provides critical situational awareness and control to a power infrastructure that must keep its power generation in balance with its load in a dynamic control process over a very large geographical area. Telecommuni- cations also plays a critical role in controlli ng the transportation system and is the basis of data exchange within the financial infrastructure. The complex interdependence between elements within each infrastr ucture is suggested and illust rated schematically but by no means wholly characterized by figure 1-7 . In the course of ordinary interruptions, ma ny of these infrastructure interdependencies and interactions can be safely ignored. In an EMP attack scenario, the immediate insult is expected to affect the different infrastruc tures simultaneously through multiple electronic component disruptions and fa ilures over a wide geographical area. Understanding these cross-cutting interdependencies and interactions is critical to assessing the capability of the full system of interdependent critical infrastructures to rec over. The modeling and simulation needed to explore the response of such a comple x situation involves a large but finite number of elements and should be am enable to analysis, at least approximately, but little effort has been made to address the problem to date. In practice, understanding the interdependen ce may be a difficult task because subject area experts are not necessarily attuned to coupling mechanisms that span the boundary between their respective discipline and another, and because an accura te representation of the interdependence requires a familiar ity with transdisciplinary phenomena. Experience demonstrates that it is some times easy to overlook the less obvious roles that such interdependencies and interacti ons may play, and coupling pathways may be easily overlooked. As an example, many of the recovery procedures developed by organizations to deal with emergencies invol ve the implicit assump tion that transporta- tion is available and people will be put on airplanes and go somewhere to diagnose and repair something. In the immediate afterm ath of 9/11, all civilian airplanes were grounded. In 1991, a single point failure inside the telecommunications system, the acci- dental severing of a single fiber-optic cable in the Ne w York City region, not only blocked 60 percent of all calls into and out of New York, but also disabled all air traffic control functions from Washington, D.C., to Boston — the busiest flight corridor in the Nation — and crippled the operations of the New York Mercantile Exchange. 2 These key interdependencies were always there, but they were not recognized as warranting advanced contingency planning, situationa l awareness in degraded conditions, and operational workarounds.   2 Neumann, Peter, Computer-Related Risks , Addison Wesley, Reading, Mass., 1995.   “Communicating across disciplines requires domain experts to learn one another’s language to pose significant questions and usefully interpret answers,” National Academy of Sci- ences , Making the Nation Safer; The Role of Science and Technology in Countering Terrorism "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 1.

Some connections are not shown (diagram provided courte sy of Sandia National Laboratory) . Recent Studies and Organizational Activities Infrastructure vulnerability has been the subj ect of recent high-level attention with three separate congressionally chartered commissions devoted to the topic, including the Presi- dent’s Commission on Critical Infrastructures (the Marsh Commission), the EMP Commission and The National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences. The latter issued a report, Making the Nation Safer: The Ro le of Science and Technology in Countering Terrorism in 2002, which explores potential vulnerabilities in the same list of critical infrastructures cited in the previ ous section. Both commissions noted the lack of a mature modeling and simulation capability as a significant weakness in the protective toolset available to planners and those charged with the mission of shielding our key infrastructures from subversion or other disruption. The National Academy of Sciences study, in particular, recommended th e development of an analytic capability based on systems engineering principles. An organizational response is beginning as well. For example, the Department of Homeland Security has absorbed and reorganized the National Infrastructures Analysis Center (NIAC), as well as the National Infr astructure Simulation and Analysis Center (NISAC). Many other government agencies a nd organizations have organized critical infrastructure protection organizations. Importa nt infrastructure modeling work has been sponsored by the Government in such orga nizations as the Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory and National Nucl ear Security Admini stration’s (NNSA) laboratories at Sandia and Los Alamos. Critical infrastructure studies also have been a growing activity in academia with the participation of individual scholars at vari ous universities around the country. A number of academic centers have also set up or spun off entire institutes de voted to the analysis of critical infrastructural matters. The Univers ity of Virginia has created the Center for Risk Management, which focuses on the appl ication of input-output econometric models"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 1. Infrastructure Commonalities 13 to analysis of critical infrastructures. In addition, George Mason and James Madison uni- versities in Virginia have created the Cent er for Infrastructure Protection Programs (CIPP). The Santa Fe Institute of Complexity Studies also has pursued important theo- retical work, and there are many other examples as well. These efforts, as well as other important re lated work, are pointi ng in the right direc- tion. Nevertheless, the bottom-line is that curr ently an adequate capab ility to model indi- vidual infrastructures on a national scale doe s not exist. Moreover, the capability to develop and integrate a fully interactive and coupled set of national- scale infrastructure models is not being pursued with sufficient priority and support to achieve it in the foreseeable future. Commission-Sponsored Modeling a nd Simulation (M&S) Activities As the Commission embarked on its task, it at tempted to engage ex isting capabilities within academia, industry, and government to si mulate the behavior of infrastructures subjected to stressful disruption. To that end, it initiated the following activities. National Workshop. The EMP Commission sponsored a national workshop on the modeling and simulation of interd ependent interacting infrastructures as part of an effort to understand the state of modeling capability in this country and to identify capabilities that might be exploited to pr ovide insight into th e expected effects of a prescribed EMP attack scenario. A number of national expe rts who are working on related modeling and simulation activities participated. The Commissi on has exploited some of these capabili- ties to develop insight that helped inform the assessmen t provided by the Commission’s full report. Contractual Activities. Current modeling and simulation tools are not sufficient to provide a realistic predictive capability fo r the interdependent infrastructures. Nevertheless, the modeling capability prove d useful in devel oping the Commission’s insight into the effects of coupling on the overall impact due to the attack and the expected recovery and restoration effort. The Commission examined such questions as: Does a strong or weak coupling tend to driv e the models to longer or shorter infra- structure restoration times? What seemed to be the sensitive parameters? What sorts of decoupling activities might be suggested to shorten reconstitution efforts? The examina- tion of these and similar questions was s upported by a number of efforts the Commission initiated with the NISAC, the University of Virginia, and Argonne National Laboratory. Some of the results of these efforts are summarized in the following section. EMP Commission Staff Analyses. The EMP Commission staff also developed analytic products to explore issues of stability and instability relate d to infrastructural coupling models. In particular, the Co mmission focused on models that coupled the power to the telecommunication infrastructure in an interactive way. The results of these efforts have inform ed the Commission’s fi ndings, as documented in this volume. Illustrative Modeling and Simulation R esults for Coupled Infrastructures To illustrate some of the complex behavior that can arise when coupling between infra- structures is included, consid er the simple case of the inte raction of only two infrastruc- tures, here taken to be the telecommunica tion and power networks. The telecommunica- tion networks themselves are in the midst of a rapid evolution that has seen data commu- nications, which represented only 10 percent of the total traffic in 1990, grow to about 50 percent of the daily telecommuni cations load, with the expect ation that voice traffic will"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 1. Infrastructure Commonalities 14 represent only a small fraction of the traffic by 2015. There is a corresponding ongoing evolution, both in the network architecture and the underlying hardware, that is described in more detail in Chapter 3 of this report. A critical element of the network of the futu re will be reliance on public data networks (PDNs). In the past, the electric power grid relied on its own communication system to monitor and control the grid, and mutual dependence between the power and telecommu- nications systems was essentiall y nil. Today the power grid re lies on PDNs for about 15 percent of its telecomm unication needs, and this figure is expected to grow to 50 percent in the near future. Figure 1-8 illustrates the expected interdependence for this evolving network. The PDNs represent networks powered by the power distribution network. The power generation and distribution ne twork is, in turn, controlled by SCADA systems that depend on telecommunications to provide situ ational awareness and to execute control functions for th e power grid. Figure 1-9 represents the results of a model simulation. The telecommunication network reverts back to a dependence on commercial power while both are in the recovery phase. The power infr astructure continues to depend in part on the probability of call blocking, while the recovery for telecommunications depends on the available power. The figure shows four distinct phases of a r ecovery process — an early phase extending to about a half hour, during which many networ k elements execute reinitializations to restore some service with power generally av ailable from battery backup, to a phase of interdependency, during which the only power option left is reliance on the commercial grid, which in turn is dependent on a commercial PDN. This model can provide insight into the recovery process. It predicts signi ficantly lengthened recovery times because of infrastructure interdependence, compared to recovery analysis that examines an infra- structure in isolation, ignori ng the factor of interdepende nce. While illustrative of the effects of interdependency, this model is not meant to represent the actual behavior of any specific real-world system today.

Results of a Model Simulation 3 In another effort, the NISAC studied the consequences of an EMP attack scenario 4 involving a large EMP source locat ed at high altitude off th e California coastline. The simulation looked at the effects on water, electric power, telecommunications, natural gas, refined petroleum products, transportatio n, labor and economic sector productivity and attempted to capture their known inte ractions. The simulation included network models for the transfer of information and infrastructure products, services, markets, and process models for each product and service. The boundary conditions for the simulation were provided by the EMP Commission; for st udy purposes, they included descriptions of the potential initial states of both the power and telecommunication infrastructures immediately following exposure to the EMP en vironment. The simulation, which was not considered realistic because it did not consider likely physical damage that would impede any recovery process, was still useful in pr oviding insight into the potential for distur- bances in one infrastructure to cascade into others. Summary No currently available modeling and simulatio n tools exist that can adequately address the consequences of disruptions and failures oc curring simultaneously in different critical infrastructures that are dynamically interdepe ndent. Many infrastructu re models that do exist are local to regional in scope.

They also are fragmented and uncoordinated, which is not an entirely negative observation, as the complexity of the task merits exploration of independent research and development approaches. Recent analytic work suggests that evolving interdependencies may be inadvertently introducing entirely new and poten tially serious vulnerabilities that could lead to infra- structure failures, even without the preci pitating catalyst of an EMP attack.

Electric Power 17 C C h h a a p p t t e e r r 2 2 . . E E l l e e c c t t r r i i c c P P o o w w e e r r Introduction The functioning of society and the economy is critically dependent upon the availability of electricity. Essentially every aspect of Am erican society requires electrical power to function. Contemporary U.S. society is not struct ured, nor does it have the means, to pro- vide for the needs of nearly 300 million Amer icans without electricity. Continued electri- cal supply is necessary for sustaining water supplies, production and distribution of food, fuel, communications, and ever ything else that is a part of our economy. Continuous, reliable electrical supply with in very tight frequency boundaries is a critical element to the continued existence and gr owth of the United States a nd most developed countries. For most Americans, production of goods and se rvices and most of life’s activities stop during a power outage. Not only is it impo ssible to perform many everyday domestic and workplace tasks, but also people must divert their time to dealing with the consequences of having no electricity. In the extreme, they must focus on survival itself. The situation is not different for the economy at large. No other infrastructure could, by its own col- lapse alone, create such an outcome. All ot her infrastructures re ly on electric power. Conversely, the electric power in frastructure is dependent on other infrastructures that are themselves vulnerable to the direct effects of electromagnetic pulse (EMP) in ways that are described elsewhere in this report. No infr astructure other than electric power has the potential for nearly complete collapse in the event of a sufficiently robust EMP attack. While a less robust attack could result in less catastrophic outco mes, those outcomes would still have serious consequences and threaten national security. The electrical power system is the largest si ngle capital-intensive infrastructure in North America. It is an enormously comple x system of systems containing fuel produc- tion, gathering and delivery syst ems, electrical generators (often themselves systems), electrical transmission systems, control syst ems of all types, and distribution systems right down to the electrical outle t and interconnection at the point of use. It is this vast array of systems and components all acting in concert, integrated into a cohesive whole to deliver electrical power at the point of us e, with supply-on-demand at a uniform fre- quency that provides the reliab le, steady, and adequate elect ric supply on which everyone has come to expect and depend. Because of the integration and interdependence of the electric system’s components and the ever gr owing shift to electroni cs and particularly microelectronics for operation, protection and co ntrol, the Nation is particularly vulner- able to a major disruptio n of the electric supply. Today, the existing electrical system at peak demand periods increasi ngly operates at or near reliability limits of its physical cap acity. Modern electroni cs, communications, pro- tection, control and computers ha ve allowed the physical system to be utilized fully with ever smaller margins for error. Therefore, a relatively modest upset to the system can cause functional collapse. As the system grow s in complexity and interdependence, resto- ration from collapse or loss of significant por tions of the system becomes exceedingly difficult. Over the last decade or two, re latively few new large-capacity electric transmission capabilities have been construc ted and most of the additions to generation capacity that have been made have been located considerab le distances from load for environmental, political, and economic reasons, adding stress and further limiting the system’s ability to withstand disruption. Si gnificant elements of the system, including many generating plants, are aging (a consider able number are more than 50 years old)"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 18 and becoming less reliable or are under pr essure to be retired for environmental considerations, further ex acerbating the situation. Should the electrical power system be lost for any substantial pe riod of time, the Com- mission believes that the cons equences are likely to be cat astrophic to civilian society. Machines will stop; transportation and commun ication will be severely restricted; heat- ing, cooling, and lighting will cease; food a nd water supplies will be interrupted; and many people may die. “Substantial period” is not quantifiable but generally outages that last for a week or more and affect a very large geographic region without sufficient sup- port from outside the outage area would qualif y. EMP represents such a threat; it is one event that may couple ultimately unmanageable currents and voltages into an electrical system routinely operated with little margin and cause the collapse of large portions of the electrical system. In fact, the Commission is deeply concerned that such impacts are certain in an EMP event unless practical steps are taken to provide pr otection for critical elements of the electric system and to provide for rapid restoration of service, particularly to essential loads. The electrical power system r outinely experiences disruptions . In most cases, the cause is the failure of one or a small number of co mponents. The overall system has a degree of durability against such failures, although in some cases failures lead to a cascading loss of power up to a regional leve l that extends over relatively short to moderate periods of time. The current strategy for recovering from such failures is based on the assumption of sporadic failures of small numbers of com ponents, and for larger failures, drawing on resources from outside the affected area. Th is strategy leaves us ill-prepared to respond effectively to an EMP attack that would poten tially result in damage to vast numbers of components nearly simultaneously over an unprecedented geographic scale. The Commission recognizes that EMP is one of several thr eats to the overall electrical power system. Some of these threats are natura lly occurring, such as geomagnetic storms. Others, like attacks using information operati ons on the system’s controls, are manmade. There are strong similarities in the types of damage resulting from the occurrence of such threats. There are also similar ities in the measures that are ap propriate to be undertaken to reduce the electrical power system’s vulne rability to each of these threats. The Commission believes that the measures it recommends will both reduce the vulnerability of the electrical power system to these threat s and improve the Nation’s ability to recover the system. The magnitude of an EMP event varies with the type, design and yield of the weapon, as well as its placement. The Commission has co ncluded that even a relatively modest-to- small yield weapon of particular characteristi cs, using design and fabrication information already disseminated through licit and illicit means, can prod uce a potentially devastating E1 field strength over very large geographical regions. This followed by E2 impacts, and in some cases serious E3 impacts operati ng on electrical components left relatively unprotected by E1, can be extremely damaging. (E3 requires a greater yield to produce major effects.) Indeed, the Commission determ ined that such weapon devices not only could be readily built and delivered, but also the specifics of these devices have been illicitly trafficked for the past quarter-centu ry. The field strengths of such weapons may be much higher than those used by the Commis sion for testing threshold failure levels of electrical system components and subsystems."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 19 Additionally, analyses available from foreign sources suggest that amplitudes and fre- quency content of EMP fields from bomb blasts calculated by U.S. analysts may be too low. While this matter is a highly technical is sue that awaits further investigation by U.S. scientific experts, it raises the specter of increased uncertainty about the adequacy of current U.S. EMP mitigation approaches. A key issue for the Commission in assessing the impact of such a disruption to the Nation’s electrical system was not only th e unprecedented widespread nature of the out- age (e.g., the cascading effects from even one or two relatively small weapons exploded in optimum location in space at present would almost certainly shut down an entire inter- connected electrical power system, perhaps a ffecting as much as 70 percent or possibly more of the United States, all in an instan t) but more significantly widespread damage may well adversely impact the time to recove r and thus have a pot entially catastrophic impact. For highly dependent systems such as co mmercial telecommunications and the finan- cial system, electric power is frequently f iltered through batteries. These act to condition the power as well as to provide limited bac kup. Local, at-site emerge ncy generators are used quite extensively for high priority loads. These include hospitals, cold storage, water systems, airport controls, ra il controls and similar uses. These systems, however, are themselves increasingly dependent on electronics to initiate start up, segregate them from the larger power system, and control their operating efficiency, thereby rendering them vulnerable to EMP. Furthermore, emergency generators have rela tively short-term fuel supplies, generally less than 72 hours. Increasingl y, locally stored fuel in bu ildings and cities is being reduced for fire safety (after 9/11) and e nvironmental pollution reasons, so that emer- gency generation availability without refueling is becoming even more limited. Batteries normally have a useful life well short of em ergency generators, often measured in a few hours. All of these tools for maintaining a stab le and adequate power supply, even to high priority loads, are intended to be temporar y at best – bridging th e time until restoration can take place. The impact of such an EMP-triggered outag e would be severe but not catastrophic if the recovery was rapid or the geographic im pact sufficiently limited. The recovery times from previous large-scale outages have been on the order of one to several days. This record of quick recovery is attributable to the remarkably effective operation of protective systems and communications that are an essentia l part of the power in frastructure and the multiple sources of replacement component s from surrounding nonimpacted systems. In this context, a short blackout scenario over a relatively small geographic region would be economically painful. Of the more than $10 trillion U.S. Gross Domestic Product, about three percent is electricity sales. However, estimates of economic loss from historical blackouts range from factors of six (for domestic customers) to 20 (for indus trial users) times the value of the interrupted service. By these measures, the economic impact of an outage is between 18 and 60 percent of total pr oduction in the affected area. Again, this estimate is for reasonably shor t-lived blackouts. A short blac kout presents no threat to national survival. On the other hand, a geographically widespr ead blackout that involves physical damage to thousands of components may produce a pe rsistent outage that would far exceed his- torical experience, with potentially catastr ophic effect. Simulation wo rk sponsored by the"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 20 Commission at the National Infrastructure Si mulation and Analysis Center (NISAC) has suggested that, after a few days , what little production that do es take place would be off- set by accumulating loss of perishables, coll apse of businesses, lo ss of the financial sys- tems and dislocation of the work force. The consequences of lack of food, heat (or air conditioning), water, waste di sposal, medical, police, fire fighting support, and effective civil authority would threaten society itself. The Commission solicited technical assistan ce and judgment from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC, wh ich is governed by the Federal Energy Regu- latory Commission [FERC] guide lines); utilities with particularly relevant experience (such as with geomagnetic storms [similar to E3]; long or very high voltage transmission; uniquely sensitive generation, special fault tes ting; and similar aspects); suppliers of protection, control, and other related equipmen t; groups dealing with industry standards; organizations of utilities, fuel suppliers, fuel transportation groups; select academic, national, and internationally recognized experts, the Department of Energy (DOE) National Laboratories, and relevant governmental entities. Willingness to be helpful was uniformly positive and generous. The Commission is grateful for this support. NERC was uniquely well suited to be of assistance. NERC was established in the aftermath of the 1965 Northeast Power Failure to enhance the reliability of the electrical system. The Commission briefed the NERC Board of Trustees on the na ture of the threat and the potential vulnerability. The NERC Board established an EMP task force under the aegis of its Critical Infrastructure Pr otection Advisory Group to provide technical advice to the Commission. The expertise of th e task force membership spanned the three NERC Interconnects (Eastern, Western Stat es Coordinating Council [WSSC], and Elec- tric Reliability Council of Te xas [ERCOT]), and all three ma jor categories of the system (generation, transmission, and distribution). This group’s involvement was an essential element in focusing the Commission on the importance of the early-time EMP pulse and its implications for recove ry, as well as on other triggers of widespread impact. It also provided technical input that was very helpful in implementing and interpreting a Commission- sponsored test program targeted at iden- tifying the threshold at which significant cont rol and protective components for the elec- trical system would begin to fail through di sruption, false data, and damage. Many of the technical and operational insights discussed within the report were influenced by this task force although the NERC Task Force did not ot herwise directly participate in the drafting of the report or in its conclusions. Description Major Elements There are three major elements of the electr ical power infrastructu re: (1) generation, (2) transmission (relatively high voltage for long distances), an d (3) distribution, whose ele- ments are interdependent, yet distinct (see figure 2-1 ). G G e e n n e e r r a a t t i i o o n n . . Power plants convert energy that is in some other form into electricity. The initial form of the energy can be mechanical (hydro, wind, or wave), chemical (hydrogen, coal, petroleum, refuse, natural gas, petrol eum coke, or other solid combustible fuel), thermal (geothermal or solar), or nuclear. Po wer plants can range fr om single solar cells to huge central station complexes. In most circumstances the first stage of generation"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 21 converts the original form of energy into rota tional mechanical energy, as occurs in a tur- bine. The turbine then drives a generator. Power System Overview Figure 2-1. Power System Overview Modern power plants all ut ilize complex protection and control systems to maximize efficiency and provide safet y. They all have common electri cal characteristics in order for them to be useable by all the various pur poses to which electric ity is put. Electronics have largely replaced all the electromechani cal devices in older plants and are used exclusively in plants of the past one or two decades. Even generator exc iters now have microprocessors and analog-to-d igital converters. These elect ronics and, thus, the power plant itself are highly vulnerable to EMP a ssault. Identifying and locating damaged gen- eration plant equipment with electronic se nsors and communication interdicted and/or unreliable due to EMP and repairing the syst em would be a complex and time-consuming process, even when personnel and parts are readily available. The fossil fuel supply system (coal, oil, wood, and natural gas) is largely dependent on electronics for its production a nd delivery of adequate fuel to the generators to produce nearly 75 percent of the Nation’s electricity. There should not be a direct and immediate impact on the fuel supply for a nuclear power plant. The interdependency between the fuel necessary to generate electricity and the electricity and electronics to deliver the fuel is critical to the recovery. Fo r example, natural gas normally is delivered just in time while oil and coal have some at-site storag e. Nuclear generation supplies a major portion of the remainder of the Nation’ s electricity. It is unlikely for the timing of an EMP attack to be such that it would di rectly and immediately impact the fuel supply for a nuclear power plant. Of the balance, hydroelectric pl ants have their own fuel supplies as do geo- thermal, solar, and wind systems. However, wind and solar may or may not be generating in any event, given their inherent uncertain ty. Hydro and geothermal are significant capa- bilities, but they are highly localized. T T r r a a n n s s m m i i s s s s i i o o n n . . Electrical power from the various pow er plants travels over a system of lines and substations to the re gions and locales where it will be consumed. The transmis- sion system moves large amounts of power gene rally over substantial distances and/or to directly serve very large electr ical loads. This definition se parates it from the distribution system, which is described below. Transmissi on includes lines (wires strung from insu-"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 22 lator strings on towers or unde rground in special in sulated containers) and substations (nodal points where several lin es intersect and protection and control functions are implemented). Within substations there are transformers (which transform power from one voltage to another); break ers (similar to on-and-off switc hes able to handle the large amounts of energy passing through); and protective devices, meters, and data transmitting and control systems. Protective devices prot ect the electrical components from unusual electrical disturbances that occur from time to time for many different reasons as well as for general safety reasons. The delivery of electrical power across or through some medium, such as a wire, encounters resistance, which itself takes pow er to overcome. Electrical power is meas- ured by the product of voltage and current. The electrical resistive lo sses (restricting the flow) are proportional to the squa re of the current. Thus it is most efficient to transmit power at the minimum current th at is practical (this results in the highest voltage for the same amount of power). Otherwis e, more power is consumed just to push the electricity through or over a path w ith higher resistance. Standard values for modern alternating cu rrent (AC) transmission line voltage range from 115 kV (115 thousand volts) to 765 kV, although some 1100 kV transmission has been developed and tested. The current carried by these lines is typically up to a few thousand amperes. Direct current (DC) is al so used in some inst ances for moving large amounts of power great di stances and for controlling the fl ow itself. The normal point of use of electricity is AC and thus the shift fr om AC to DC and back from DC to AC makes DC uneconomical other than in special circ umstances. The use of DC is increasing, how- ever, as power costs continue to grow and th e technology to shift from AC to DC and back becomes less expensive. Transformers within the substations are used to move the voltage from one line or power plant up to or down to another voltage while maintaining essentially the same level of power. D D i i s s t t r r i i b b u u t t i i o o n n . . Loads or end users of electricity (residences, co mmercial establishments, and even most industry) require electrical power to be available in the voltages needed in adequate supply when they need it. This ofte n means in relatively small quantities at low voltage and current. The size of the wires and switches in a t ypical house are able to be quite small and of much lower cost because th e power available to th at house is restricted to be relatively low. The electrical and electronic appliances similarly need only a small amount of power to be available. Therefore, the high-voltage power of the transmission system described previously is reduced (s tepped down) through transformers and distrib- uted to the end users in levels they need and can use. Reactive load balancing equipment is also part of the distribution system. This equipment is needed for system stability. The electrical power system’s stability is finely tuned and fragile. Large-scale failures most often occur because the system is de stabilized by local anomalies. The distinction between transm ission and distribution is so metimes a fuzzy one because it depends on the size and need of the load and the specific system involved. The distinc- tion is relevant for regulatory and business purposes. It does vary somewhat from region to region. Traditionally distribution distan ces are under 20 miles and voltages are less than 69.5 kV (more commonly 13.5 kV). Howeve r voltages up to 115 kV are used in some locations. Distribution has substations just like transmission, only smaller. These are not manned. Of importance is that the lo cal switching, controls , and critical equip- ment have become largely electronic with concomitant vulnerability to EMP."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 23 Alternating current, as opposed to direct curren t, is the medium for use of electricity as a general matter. Electricity production, tran smission, distribution, an d use require a pre- cise frequency. Thus it is necessary across th e vast electrical power system to precisely and reliably synchronize the fr equency and phase of power coming from different gener- ating sources and reaching and being utilized by different loads. Testimony to the accu- racy of this control has b een the wide use and dependenc e on electric clocks and the functioning of many electronic devices. The di fficulty of maintaining the frequency syn- chronization during off-normal conditions is us ually a factor in large-scale power out- ages. For example, when the frequency moves very far from a constant required level, protective schemes at the gene rators within the transmission system and at the loads alarm and often automatically trip. Occasionally these trip out of proper sequence causing the system to compound rather than mitig ate the problem, and the system collapses. C C o o n n t t r r o o l l a a n n d d P P r r o o t t e e c c t t i i o o n n S S y y s s t t e e m m s s . . Overlaid on these three primary elements — genera- tion, transmission and distribution — is a control system that directs the power where it is needed, maintains the frequency, and protects the system. Control is also necessary for commercial aspects. The controls must protect the system from transients such as light- ning, correct synchronization e rrors by activatin g reactive sources or loads, isolate mal- functioning elements of the grid, and prev ent self-damage from improper compensation or human error. The control systems also enable the deregulated energy marketplace by tracking the origin, route, a nd destination of the energy co mmodity. Central to the moni- toring and coordination of the power grid is a broad cl ass of devices called supervisory control and data acquisition (S CADA) systems. These conform to an agreed set of stan- dards that make it possible to network many such systems over a generic communications system, regardless of modality. SCADA devices are in broad use in a variety of applica- tions other than power. The revolution in communication, informati on, system and component protection, and control technologies has reache d essentially every segment of the economy, and its heavy impact on the electric power industry is no exception. The growing dependence of our infrastructures on ubiquitous electronic control and protec tion systems confers great benefits in terms of economic and operationa l efficiency, rapid diagnosis of problems, and real-time remote control. At the same time and less often remarked, it also represents a potential new vector of vulnerability that could be exploited by de termined adversaries, and intellectual efforts to mitigate such threats have been engaged. The infrastructure’s vulnerability to EMP and other broad-impact events raises th e threat to an entirely new and vastly expanded plane of se rious to catastrophic impacts. Electronics have enabled electric power systems — generation, transmission, and dis- tribution — to achieve greater levels of efficiency and safety with much lower adverse environmental impacts. Far less generation, transmission, and distribution are now neces- sary to provide the same amount of benefit to the end user, thus si gnificantly enhancing productivity and overall quality of life. In doing so, howeve r, the electrical system operates closer to theoretical capacity and thus at narrower margins of safety and reliability. Electronics have improved system economics and lowered the overall cost of power to the end user while reducing pressure on basic re sources and limiting potential adverse impacts on the environment. This enhanced capability, both on the provider and consumer side, is in part responsible (along with the regulatory envi ronment) for the low rate of investment in the high-value component s of the electric system infrastructure. For"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 24 example, slowly increasing electrical transm ission demand has largely been met within the limits of current production capacity for these components. The continuing evolution of el ectronic devices into systems that once were exclusively electromechanical, enabling computer control instead of direct human intervention and use of broad networks like the Internet, result s in ever greater reliance on microelectron- ics and thus the present and sharply growing vulnerability of the power system to EMP attack. Just as the computer networks have opened the possibility to cyber assault on the power system or to electrical power system collapse associated with software failure (as during the August 14, 2003, blackout), they have provided an opportunistic pathway for EMP attack that is likely to be far more widespread, devastating, and difficult to assess and restore. Switches, relays, and even gene rator exciters now have microprocessors and analog-to-digital converters. These and other low-power electronics cannot be expected to withstand EMP-generated stresses unless they are well protected. Protection must encompass both device design and system integration. Even a well-designed system installed without regard for EMP intrusion via connecting lines can be rendered inopera- tive by EMP stress. There is a serious questio n regarding whether manual control of the system sufficient to allow continued service will be possible even at a much-reduced state in the aftermath of EMP. The key vulnerable electronic systems are SCADA along with digi tal control systems (DCS) and programmable logic controllers (PLC ). SCADAs are used for data acquisition and control over large and geogr aphically distributed infrastructure systems while DCSs and PLCs are used in localized applications . These systems all share similar electronic components, generally representative of co mponents that form the internal physical architectures of portable computers. The di fferent acronyms by which we presently iden- tify SCADA, DCS, and PLC should not obscure th e fact that the elec tronics have evolved to the point where the differing taxonomies are more representative of the functional dif- ferences of the electronics equipment rather than differences in th e electronics hardware itself. Electronic control equipment and innovative us e of electronic controllers in equipment that is not usually considered control equipment are rapidl y replacing the purely electro- mechanical systems and devices that were their predecessors. The use of such control equipment is growing worldwide, and exis ting users are upgrading equipment as new functionalities develop. The U.S. power i ndustry alone is invest ing about $1.4 billion annually in new SCADA equipment. This is perhaps 50 times the reinvestment rate in transformers for transmission. The present ra te represents upgrade and replacement of the protection and control systems to ever more sophisticated mi croelectronics at roughly 25 to 30 percent annually, with each new component more susceptible to EMP than its predecessor. The shift to greater electronic co ntrols, computers, and the Internet also results in fewer operators and different opera tor training. Thus the ability to operate the system in the absence of such electronics a nd computer-driven actions is fast disappear- ing. This is almost certain to have a highly delete rious effect on restor ing service in the event of an EMP attack. Electrical System Organization The integrated electrical power system of th e United States and integrated systems in Canada and Mexico are covered by the NERC. This vast network is broken into only three truly separate systems at the presen t time — the Eastern Interconnection, the"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 25 Western Interconnection, and Texas. The di viding line geographically between the Eastern and Western systems is roughly a line between M ontana and North Dakota con- tinuing southward. The largest of these, th e Eastern Interconnection, serves roughly 70 percent of the electrical load and population of the United States. The three regions are separated electrically in AC in order to provide barriers fo r transfer of major frequency deviations associated with system separations . This mode of operation between regions is referred to as maintaining frequency independenc e. Importantly, this also acts as a barrier to EMP-caused system disruption or any othe r major system disruption and consequent collapse crossing between these three regions. In figure 2-2 the map of the three NERC regions shows the divisions geographically and the barriers for transfer of major frequenc y deviations associated with system separa- tions. There are some nonsynchronous connecti ons, such as DC back-to-back converter installations that facilitate limited power transfers yet maintain a barrier. The subregions identified in the map within a region are for organizational, record keeping, and man- agement only. They do not have frequency i ndependence from one another at this time. Thus at present, whole regions can be cause d to collapse by sufficiently large electrical disturbances, like EMP, which severely exacerbates the problem of service to critical loads and importantly impedes restoration where delay increases the adverse impacts virtually exponentially.

Electric Power 26 economy and use of ever greater labor- and mate rial-saving devices continues to drive the need for new generation. Furthermore, older generation is being re placed for economic, environmental, and locational reasons. In creasing capital costs emanating from world market competition and natural disasters, plus the increasing cost of capital, have slowed the addition of new generation capacity. The in ability in many cases to get generation to market with reasonable assurance due to li mited transmission has similarly limited new generation additions. Finally, re gulatory returns and pressure from competing uses of capital within utility system s or their parents, including municipal and public systems, have further restricted new generation of c onsequence. As a result, generation capacity margins have decreased. Changes in the regulatory environment with greater deregulati on of the generating sector have further encouraged recent incr eases in new generation capacity along with retirement of older units. Most of the new pow er plants over the past decade or two have been natural gas-fired units that are agile in their ability to adapt to market demands and opportunities, are relatively cl ean environmentally for fossil plants, faster to build and have lower capital cost than many alternative generator opti ons. They have been located farther from load in most instances than the older plants or previ ously planned additions, and they are operated and integrated very diffe rently than in the past as economic deci- sions are often driven by very diverse and nonintegrated responsibility. This can stretch the ability of the transmission system to ge t the new generation to load. The type and location of new generation stress es the system and increases its vulnerability to various threats including EMP. The capacity margin (standby capacity for emer gencies or other unplanned needs) for the transmission system grid (system of higher voltage lines and substations) has decreased from about 20 percent twenty year s ago to about 10 percent now as an overall system matter although there are considerable regional or local variations. This reduced margin is due to little new construction, improved efficiency of the existing system, and the location of new generation away from loa d. It is further exacer bated by the addition of significant generation from renewable reso urces such as wind energy, which operates when the wind blows, not when the electrical system might otherwise require power. This results in shifting the genera tion between the wind and other controllable generation on an unpredictable basis regardle ss of the transmission system reliability needs, all of which results in greater and less predictable stresses on the overall system. Operation of the transmission system at today’s reduced margin while maintaining excellent reliability has been enabled by improved technology and operating practices for protection, command, and control of the tran smission grid. While power production and consumption have grown, almost all of the gr owth has been absorb ed on existing power lines although new substations have been a dded. There has been very little construction of transmission capacity, particularly of new longer distance transmission lines, or renewal and replacement of existing infrastructure for many reasons, including deregula- tion (discussed in the next section of this chapter). The transmission system thus is oper- ating with little ability to abso rb adverse electrical impacts. Overall, as a result of redu ced generation capacity margin s, the generation component of the system is far less able to compensate for the difficulties that may be encountered within the transmission system and vice versa. Together, the consequence is a power sys- tem far more vulnerable to disruption than in th e past, and this vulnerability is increasing."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 27 While greater protection and control schemes have still provided a very reliable system in spite of this, the system is being stressed beyond reasonable limits. The electrical power system has become virtually fully dependent upon electronic systems working nearly flawlessly. The overall system reliability is testimony to the skill and effectiveness of the control systems. However, the lack of marg in (combination of generation and transmis- sion margins) results in making catastrophic cascading outages fa r more likely, and should the electronics be disrupted, the system is highly likely to fail on a broad scale. Thus, the small margin and reliance on elec tronics give rise to EMP vulnerability. High-value assets (assets that are critical to th e production and delive ry of large vol- umes of electrical power and those critical for service to key loads) in the system are vul- nerable to EMP through the loss of protection e quipment due to E1 and even if E3 levels were not large enough to cause damage. Th e largest and most cr itical of these are transformers. Transformers are the critical link (1) between generation and transmission, (2) within the transmission network, (3) between the transmission and distribution systems, and (4) from the distribution to the load. The transformers that handle electrical pow er within the transmission system and its interfaces with the generation and distribution systems are large, expensive, and to a con- siderable extent, custom built. The transmission system is fa r less standardized than the power plants are, which themselves are some what unique from one to another. All pro- duction for these large transformers used in the United States is currently offshore. Delivery time for these items under benign circ umstances is typically one to two years. There are about 2,000 such transf ormers rated at or above 345 kV in the United States with about 1 percent per year being replaced due to failure or by the addition of new ones. Worldwide production capacity is less th an 100 units per year and serves a world market, one that is growing at a rapid rate in such countries as Ch ina and India. Delivery of a new large transformer ordered today is nearly 3 years, including both manufacturing and transportation. An event damaging several of these transformers at once means it may extend the delivery times to well beyond cu rrent time frames as production is taxed. The resulting impact on timing for restorati on can be devastating. Lack of high voltage equipment manufacturing capacity represents a glaring weakness in our survival and recovery to the extent these transformers are vulnerable. Dist ribution capability is roughly in the same condition although current delivery times are much less (i.e., limited manufacturing capability, although there is domestic production). Deregulation At least a decade ago, the power systems we re owned and operated by vertically inte- grated utility companies. These entities consisted of investor-owned (owned by share- holders, commonly referred to as private) utilities, utilities that are government constructs (federal, such as the Tennessee Valley Au thority, Bonneville Powe r Administration, and others), consumer-owned cooperatives, municipa lities, and entities of the state such as peoples and public utility dist ricts. The different entitie s were granted monopoly powers for service and were regulated through a va riety of mechanisms including self-regulation for some of the government enti ties. In any given service terr itory, the local utility owned the generation, transmission, and distribution and was responsible for adequate supply, reliability, and other asp ects of service quality. This situation has changed. On April 24, 1996, FERC issued Orders 888 and 889, which encouraged wholesale power supply comp etition, deregulating th is single aspect of"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 28 the electrical industry. This allowed any pa rty to produce and sell power to any other party at the wholesale levels (meaning sales to utility or load-servi ng entities, as opposed to direct retail sales to end users). Existi ng generation by investor-owned utilities was forced to be divested in many circumstances. Th is regulation applied only to the investor- owned utilities comprising a bit more than half the total U.S. electrical load. Many gov- ernmental or public entities did not possess ge neration of their own, and some that did followed by example and market imperatives. In some instances states have carried the deregulation further to a variety of form s of competition at the retail level. The transmission infrastructure has remained regulated, and the previous vertically integrated systems in many instances were not allowed to commercially control their transmission in order to free up competition at the wholesale levels. Due to the complexity of an open market using an infrastructure that was built for another operating environment, the requirements for investment in the transmission system have been uncertain and more expensive. FERC regulates the transmission facilities in terms of use and pricing, but not location. The federal transmission regulation paradigm is moving toward being market based, which will have un known impacts but is believed to assist in the development of new transmission facilities. The states also play an important role in the regulation of transmission and generation that is not consistent from state to state. With the market (and the market model itself) in flux, there is unwillingness presently to invest in transmission infrastructure. There is no incentive for the states or local ities to accede to construction of lines that are to move power over or thr ough the state or locality without direct benefit to such state or locality. The power going through the lines pays no fees and no taxes to the hosts, although there are minor property taxes on the physic al facilities in some instances. Until recently there was no capability to track the pa th of a given unit of energy when operating in AC and even then it is more calculation via model-specific than actual measurement. This is because AC power travels over the pa th of least resistance not as the flow of power might be contracted. Thus while a ne w interconnected line may appear to carry power pursuant to a contract for delivery between two partie s, it is unlikely that the power will flow physically as envisioned. Thus it is unclear who will pay for the use of the new line. While new capability to track AC power (E-tags) could provide the basis for fiscal incentives for new line construction, it is not yet widely deployed nor well under- stood or accepted. Moreover, regulatory requi rements create impediments to new line construction even if the incenti ves and capital are at hand. In short, from a business per- spective, transmission lines are often low return or loss centers in the current environment. The end state of the regulatory paradigm is still undetermined, a nd this uncertainty coupled with lack of local benefits when passing through state and local areas all contrib- ute to the diminishing transmission capacity ma rgins. There is uncertainty whether, by the time construction of new lines is complete d, the investment could be recovered. It is likely that this situation will persist until the market model is clarified and implemented, which may take several years given the comple xity and number of competing interests, including between the states and the Federal Government as well as with neighboring states.

Electric Power 29 Vulnerabilities In order to assess the nature of EMP effects on the electr ical system, we separately analyzed the potential effects of an electro magnetic pulse on each of the three main con- stituents of the power system — generati on, transmission, and distribution. Within the context of a principal finding of the NERC EM P task force, recovery following an EMP- caused outage within any reasonably acceptable time is contingent largely on preventing damage to the high-value assets (assets that are critical to the production and delivery of large volumes of electrical power and those cr itical for service to key loads) and identi- fying and replacing ones that become dama ged. Therefore, the Commission focused on identifying what those high value assets mi ght be and their susceptibility to EMP dam- age. Thus, proper design, installation, and f unctioning of the protective equipment for these assets during an EMP attack are critical. There are other critical aspects to recovery that are discussed subsequently. Generation A power plant is designed to protect itself in the event of instantaneous loss of load, electrical faults or trips on the interconnected transmissi on system or internally, fre- quency excursions beyond rather tight limits, an d often for the loss of an external power source for proper shutdown. None of these c onditions should damage a power plant if the protective systems function properly, as freque ntly has been demonstrated. Very little damage to generation has occurred in previous blackouts, including the August 14, 2003, blackout. However, some malfunctioning in the multiple controls throughout a power plant does occur, albeit rarel y. Therefore, on a broad enough s cale, as in an EMP attack affecting many power plants at once, damage to a small number of these power plants would be expected statisticall y. Since E2 and E3 are not asse ssed as direct threats to the generation system (except for their step-up transformers and associated breakers), the critical vulnerability question is E1-i nduced plant control system failure. The E1 pulse can upset the protection and control system , including damaging control and protective system components, and cause the plant to trip or trigger emergency con- trolled shut down. Current, temp erature, pressure, frequency, and other physical parame- ters are monitored by the control systems. These provide independent measurements of same system, and all can cause the plant to trip off line and go to controlled shut down. Given the redundancy of protective system de sign, either several protective devices or devices in the critical path woul d have to fail in order for the plant not to initiate protec- tive shutdown. However, if the control syst em itself or secondary nodal controls and receivers critical to orderly shut down are themselves damaged, as is reasonably possible with E1, then the plant is seriously at ris k. Power plants, particul arly newer ones, are highly sophisticated, very high-speed machin es, and improper shut down can damage or destroy any of the many critical components and can even cause a catastrophic failure. Nuclear plants are an exception due to th e nature of their pr otection schemes. Given the range of potential E1 levels, analysis and test resu lts provide a basis to expect sufficient upset to cause a plant’s system to shut down improperly in many cases. Proper shutdown depends on synchronized operation of multiple controllers and switches. For example: coal intake and exhaust turbines mu st operate together or else explosion or implosion of the furnace may occur. Cooli ng systems must respond properly to tempera- ture changes during shut down or thermal gradients can cause boiler deformation or rup- ture. Orderly spin-down of the turbine is required to avoid shaft sagging and blades impacting the casings. Bearings can easily fail and freeze or damage the shaft if the shut"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 30 down does not engage emergency lubrication. Th ere are similar issues inside very com- plex machines operating at high temperatures at fast speeds with ti ght tolerances. Thus, power plant survivability depends on a great many protective systems creating multiple pathways to plant damage and failure. Restoration of some damage can be very long term, certainly months and in some instances years. The loss of generation of an y size itself would contribute to systemwide collapse and certainly would limit restorati on. Manufacturers of generation plant protec- tion and control equipment performed some lim ited evaluation and while there are layers of redundancy, as noted, more and more thes e systems are going to computer-controlled microelectronics, and thus are mo re susceptible to EMP disruption. At the device level, power plant protectiv e systems are less expos ed than the corre- sponding systems in the transmission grid. They act on local information, so failure of telecommunications systems is not as much of an issue for plant protection where opera- tors are available in most instances 24/7 an d can independently asse ss the situation and act. The control equipment, protective systems, sensors, and current transformers typi- cally (but by no means always) will be inside the plant although this does not necessarily mean they will not be exposed. In general there will be no outside cable runs, so the building itself will provide some EMP protec tion. However the lengths of these interior cables can be on the order of 100 meters. Cabl e trays may or may not provide additional protection, depending on their ma terial and installation method. The key is not device- or component-level testing for EMP susceptibility but overall control and protective system test to evaluate vulnerabilit y. Subjecting an entire sophisti cated and modern power plant to testing is not feasible. However, it does not take many damaged plants out of the many hundreds to seriously impact th e system operation and the abili ty to restore service. The fact that all power plants exposed to E1 EMP will be illuminated simultaneously (within one power cycle) makes the situation extremely serious. S S y y s s t t e e m m R R e e s s t t o o r r a a t t i i o o n n — — G G e e n n e e r r a a t t i i o o n n The restoration of the system from collapse is very complex in operation, almost an art rather than a science, and it requires highly trained and ex perienced operators with con- siderable information and controls at hand. Basi cally, in isolated cases or when beginning restoration, a load and genera tion source has to be identified and inte rconnected without interference from other loads or genera tion. These are then matched and gradually restored together. Thereafter, each increment of generation and load is added in turn to a larger operating system of generation and lo ad. As each component of load and genera- tion are included, the frequency will be impacted. If it varies outside very tight limits, it will all trip off and have to be put back toge ther again. In most system disruptions leading to blackouts, there are large amounts of system still intact on the pe riphery of the disrup- tion, which are able to greatly assist in th e restoration, more easily allowing and absorb- ing each addition of generation and load until all is restored. Every generator requires a load to match its electrical output as every load requires electricity. In the case of the generator, it n eeds load so it does not overspin and fail, yet not so much load it cannot function. In a larg e integrated system, where increments of load and generation are not suffi cient to cause the frequency to drop or rise above accept- able margins, it is relatively straightfo rward and commonplace, just as turning on a lightswitch causes a generator someplace to pi ck up the load. In the case where the sys-"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 31 tem is being restored and there are few lo ads and generators connected, this matching requires careful management and communi cation between load and generation. Generation start-up for most plants requires power from another source to drive pumps, fans, safety systems, fuel delivery, and so on. Some, like hydroelectric and smaller die- sels can start directly or from battery sour ces assuming they can control their access to matching load. In the case of EMP, large geogra phic areas of the electrical system will be down, and there may be no existing system opera ting on the periphery for the generation and loads to be incrementally added with ease. Furthermore, recovery of lost generation would be impacted by the loss of other infrastr ucture in varying degr ees according to the type of plant. In that instance, it is necessary to have a “black start”: a start without exter- nal power source. Coal plants, nuclear plants, large gas- and oil-fired plants, geothermal plants, and some others all require power fr om another source to restart. In general, nuclear plants are not allowed to restart unt il and unless there are independent sources of power from the interconnected transmission grid to provide for independent shutdown power. This is a regulatory requirement for pr otection rather than a physical impediment. What might be the case in an emergency situat ion is for the Government to decide at the time. Black-start generation is that kind of generator that is independent of outside power sources to get started, hence the term black start. Most black start units today are hydroelectric plants, small gas peaking units, small oil-fired peaking units and diesel units. In some cases the black start unit may be collocated with a la rger power plant in order to get the larger one st arted for system restoration. Fu el supply would then be the only issue from the generation perspective; fo r example, a gas plant might not have the fuel due to EMP damage someplace in the delivery system. Assuming the black start units were not damaged by EMP or have been repaired and assuming they are large enough to be significant, workers can begin th e system restoration as building blocks from the generation side of the equation. E1 may have also damaged their startup elec- tronics, which will need to be repaired first. It is often the case that generation capable of black start is not manned, so if they fail to start remotely, a person will need to be dis- patched to find the problem, locate the needed parts, and get it operating. There are not many black start-capable units in locations that are suitable to independent restoration at this time. Recovery in most regions theref ore needs to wait for other areas to restore power and then be reconnected increment by increment. Even if partially disabled control systems successfully protect the critical generating equipment, all affected plants would face a lo ng process of testing and repairing control, protective, and sensor systems. Protective and safety systems have to be carefully checked out before start up or greater loss mi ght occur. Repair of furnaces, boilers, tur- bines, blades, bearings, and other heavy hi gh-value and long lead-time equipment would be limited by production and transportation availa bility once at-site sp ares are exhausted. While some spare components are at each site and sometimes in spare parts pools domestically, these would not cover very large high-value ite ms in most cases, so exter- nal sources would be needed. Often supply from an external source can take many weeks or several months in the best of times, if only one plant is seeking repair, and sometimes a year or more. With multiple plants affected at the same time, let alone considering infrastructure impediments, restoration time would certainly become protracted."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 32 Transmission Most generation is located out side major population areas and thus sometimes at great distances from the load being served. In genera l, electricity often travels great distances on an efficient high-voltage transmission system . The transmission system is made up of different owners, voltage levels , and controls. Yet power must be routed to where it is needed, so there are nodes called substations where the power lines join and are switched, and where power is moved from one voltage le vel to another level, interconnected with other transmission system com ponents, and sent on to distri bution systems. Finally as it gets closer to load, power is stepped down (reduced in voltage) a nd then down again and often down yet again to and within the dist ribution system and then normally down again to the delivery point for the load. Each of those step-down points requires a transformer to effect the change and breakers to isolate the transformer when necessary. In the event of the loss of a generation f acility, a fully functional transmission system can move the remaining generation from whatev er plants can operate to areas otherwise affected by loss of a particular generating stat ion. This occurs in normal practice as gen- eration plants are brought in a nd out of service for one reason or another. The same thing happens when part of the transmission syst em is down for whatever reason. Other trans- mission in the network picks up the loss and generation is shifted so that the loads can continue to be served. All this is accomplishe d regularly as part of system operation. The ability to adjust quickly given access to a multitude of resources, generation, and trans- mission makes the system reliabl e. Incapacitation of sufficient elements of the transmis- sion system would mean the inab ility to deliver power whether the generation is available or not. The same inability would be true for incapacitation of sufficient generation. In the case of EMP, both would be likel y to be impacted simultaneousl y. This is what results in a blackout where the load does not get serve d. The transmission syst em is highly vulner- able to EMP. Substation control systems at the nodes or hubs in the transmission system are inher- ently more exposed to the E1 pulse than th eir power plant counterparts, which are often not in buildings at all. The sensors, co mmunications, and power connections are outdoors and cables (i.e., antennas in the sense of an EMP receptor) which may be hundreds of meters long may be buried, run along the ground, or elevated. The control devices them- selves, including the protective relays, may even be in remote structures that provide little electromagnetic attenuation. Most substations do not have operato rs present but are remotely controlled from power dispatch centers, in some inst ances hundreds of miles away. Operation of transmission substations de pends on various communications modalities, including telephone, microwave, power lin e communications, cell phones, satellite phones, the Internet, and others. Typically, th ese modes are used for dedicated purposes; they do not necessarily provide a multiple redu ndant system but are “stove piped.” From the point of view of managing routine syst em perturbations and preventing their propa- gation, NERC advises us that the telephone remains the most important mode. If the voice communications were completely interrupt ed, it would be diffi cult, but still rea- sonably possible, to successf ully continue operations — provided there were no signifi- cant system disruptions. However in the case of an EMP event with multiple simultane- ous disruptions, continued operation is not pos sible. Restoration without some form of communication is also not possible. Communica tion is clearly critical in the path to restoration."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 33 Just as in the case involving power plants, the first critical issue is the proper function- ing of the protective elements, specifically re lays, followed by the lo cal control systems. These elements protect the hi gh-voltage breakers and transformers that are high-value assets. High-value assets are those that are cr itical to system functi oning and take a very long time to replace or repair. Other protect ed devices, such as capacitors and reactive power generators, are also high value and nearly as critical as the transformers. E1 is likely to disrupt and perhaps damage protectiv e relays, not uniformly but in statistically very significant numbers. Left unprotected, as would likely result from E1 damage or degradation to the protective relays, the high- value assets would lik ely suffer damage by the transient currents produced during the syst em collapse, as well as potentially from E2 and E3 depending upon relative magnitude s. Commission testing of some typical protective relays with lower than expect ed EMP levels provides cause for serious concern. The high-value transmission equipment is subject to potentially large stress from the E3 pulse. The E3 pulse is not a freely propagating wave like E1 and E2, but the result of distortions in the Earth’s magnetic field caused by the upper atmosphere nuclear e xplosion. The distortion couples very efficiently to long transmission lines and induces quasi-direct current electrical currents to flow. The curre nts in these long lines can aggregate to become very large (minute-long ground-induced currents [GIC] of hundreds to thousands of amperes) sufficient to damage major electrical power system components. Wi th respect to transformers, probably the hardest to replace quickly, this quasi-direct current, carried by all three phases on the primary windings of the transformer, drives the transformer to saturation, creating har- monics and reactive power. The harmonics cause transformer case heating and over-cur- rents in capacitors potentially resulting in fi res. The reactive power flow would add to the stresses on the grid if it were not already in a state of collapse. Historically, we know that geomagnetic storms, which can induce GIC flow s similar to but less intense than those likely to be produced by E3, have caused tr ansformer and capacitor damage even on properly protected equipment (see figure 2-3 ). Damage would be highly likely on equipment unprotected or partially protected due to E1. The likelihood and scope of the E3 problem are exacerbated by the small transmission margins currently available. The closer a tr ansformer is operating to its performance limit, the smaller the GIC needed to cause failure. Moreover, newer transmission substa- tions are increasingly using thre e single-phase transformers to handle higher power trans- fer, since the equivalently rated three-phase transformers are too large to ship. The three- phase systems are more resistant to GIC, si nce their design presumes a balanced three- phase operation. Thus the separate single-phase transformers are more susceptible to damage from GIC.

Electric Power 34 tion needs to be matched to an increment of load and then add the next matching incre- ments and so on. As the number of increments becomes greater, there is some flex in the system to absorb variations. As a result, the restoration is easier a nd goes much faster. In the initial increments however, the transmi ssion system link between generation and load has to be isolated so other loads, which may well remain connected, do not impact the effort. This is tricky and requires careful coor dination to adjust the breakers in the sub- stations so the link is rout ed correctly and safely. The power transmission grid is designed to break into islands of hopefully matched generation and load when the system receives a sufficient electrical disruption. This is both to protect service in the nonimpacted regi ons and to allow for the stable systems to be used to restart the island that lost f unctionality. With EMP, broad geographic reach and simultaneous multiple levels of disruption result in a situation in which the islanding schemes themselves will probably fail to work in the EMP-affected area. Since the geo- graphic area is so large, perhaps encomp assing an entire NERC region or possibly more, restoring the system from the still functioning perimeter may well not be possible at all or would take a great deal of time; the Commi ssion estimates weeks to months, at least in the best circumstance. Distribution Most of the long power outages that Ameri cans have experienced were due to physical damage to the distribution system — local damage. This damage is usually caused by natural events such as weather. Windblow n trees fall on neighborhood power lines or ice buildup drops lines that in some instances make contact with live lines causing arcs that in turn can even result in di stribution transformers exploding. EMP damage to the distribution system would be less dramatic than that inflicted upon the transmission system but still would result in loss of load. The pr incipal effect of EMP would be E1-induced arcing acro ss the insulators that separate the power lines from the supporting wood or metal poles. The arcing can damage the in sulator itself and in some cases result in pole-mounted transformer expl osions. Damage to large numbers of insu- lators and pole-mounted transformers could also result in a shortage of replacement parts, as these items are fairly reliable under norma l conditions, and spares are not kept to cover widespread losses. Ultimately workarounds an d replacements can be found in most cir- cumstances although widespread damage and im pact to related infr astructures will cause delay. The important effect of the loss of load in the EMP scenario is that it happens simulta- neously. Thus it represents a substantial upset to the entire grid, causing the frequency to spin up and protective relays to open on gene ration and can by itself result in a cascading failure and blackout of the entire NERC region. Similarly, a ny consumer or industrial electrical device that is s hut down or damaged by EMP cont ributes to the load loss and further drives the system to collapse. It beco mes a case of what comes first to cause what failure since the EMP E1 impulse is virtually simultaneously disrupting all facets of the electrical system and load. Synergistic Effects of E1, E2, and E3 The effects of EMP on the electrical power system are fundamentally partitioned into its early, middle, and late time effects (caused by the E1, E2, and E3 components, respectively). The net impact on the electric po wer grid includes the synergistic interac- tion of all three, occurring nearly simu ltaneously over a large geographic area. The"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 35 Commission has concluded that the electrical system within the NERC region so dis- rupted will collapse with near certainty. Thus one or more of the three integrated, fre- quency-independent NERC regions will be without electrical service. This loss is very large geographically and restor ation is very likely to be beyond short-term emergency backup generators and batteries. Any reasonabl e EMP event would be much larger than the Texas region so basically the concern is the Eastern and Western regions with Texas either included or not depending upon the lo cation of the weapon. The basic threat to U.S. society that moves an EMP event from a local or short-term adverse impact to a more prolonged and injurious event is the tim e it takes to restore electrical and other infrastructure service. The early time EMP, or E1, is a freely propagati ng field with a rise time in the range of less than one to a few nanoseconds. E1 dama ges or disrupts electronics such as the SCADA, DCS, and PLC as well as communica tions and to some extent transportation (necessary for supplies and personnel). This disrupts control systems, sensors, communi- cation systems, protective systems, generator systems, fuel systems, environmental miti- gation systems and their related computers, as well as the ability to repair. SCADA com- ponents, in particular, are fre quently situated in remote e nvironments and operate without proximate human intervention. While their cri tical electronic elemen ts are usually con- tained within some sort of metallic box, the enclosures’ service as a protective Faraday cage is inadequate. Such metallic containers are designed only to provide protection from the weather and a modicum of physical securi ty. They are not designed to protect the electronics from high-energy electromagnetic pul ses, which may infiltrate either from the free field or from the many antennae (cable connections) that compromise electromag- netic integrity. The E1 pulse also causes flas hovers in the lower voltage distribution system, resulting in immediate broad geographic scale loss of elec trical load and requiring line or insulator replacement for restoration. The intermediate time EMP, or E2, is sim ilar in frequency regime to lightning, but vastly more widespread, like thousands to millions of simultaneous lightning strikes, even if each strike is at lower amplitude than most naturally occurring lightning. The electrical power system has existing protective measures for lightning, which are proba- bly adequate. However, the impact of this many simultaneous lightning-like strike dis- ruptions over an extremely large geographic area may exceed those protections. The most significant risk, however, is synergistic because the E2 pulse follows on the heels of the E1. Thus where E1-induced damage has ci rcumvented lightning protection, the E2 impact could pass directly into major system components and damage them. The late time EMP, or E3, follows E1 and E2 and may last for a minute or more. The E3 pulse is similar in a great many respec ts to geomagnetic effects induced by solar storms. Solar storms and their impacts on elec trical systems with long lines have been thoroughly evaluated and are known to cause serious damage to major electrical system components at much lower levels than the reasonably possible E3 impact. This damage has been incurred in spite of functioning, in -place protective systems. Given the preced- ing E1 and E2 pulse damage to the protec tive systems and other system components, damage from E3 to unprotected major sy stem components is virtually assured. EMP is inimical to the continued functioni ng of the electrical power system and the reliable behavior of electronics. Each of the three EMP modes of system insult is suffi-"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 36 cient by itself to cause disrupt ion and probable functional colla pse of large portions of the interconnected electrical power system at EM P threat levels. In every EMP attack, all three assaults (E1, E2, and E3) are delivered in sequence and nearly simultaneously. It is the Commission’s assessment that functiona l collapse of the electrical power system region within the primary area of assault is virtually certain. Furthermore, widespread functional collapse may result even from a small weapon w ith a significant E1 compo- nent. While stopping electrical supply over a broad geographical area nearly instantane- ously is damaging, it is the time it takes to re store service that is important, assuming restoration is possible, which itself may be questioned in some instances. System Collapse Scenarios NERC was one of several key advisers on th e EMP impact assessment discussed above although the conclusions and emphasis are th e Commission’s alone. NERC also informed the Commission that there is no modeling capability extant, either deterministic or statis- tical, that can assess with confidence the outcome of simultaneous , combined subsystem failures. Putting together a c oherent picture of the projec ted system collapse scenario must rely on expert judgment. Large-scale load losses in excess of 10 percen t are likely at EMP threat levels. Instan- taneous unanticipated lo ss of load, by itself, can cause syst em collapse. This is possible at 1 percent loss, and is very likely above 10 percent. At similar percentage levels, loss of generation can also cause system collapse. Bo th the load loss (normally from a transmis- sion system failure) and generation loss resu lting in system collapse have been experi- enced. At the levels of loss for each, collapse is highly likely if not certain. Systemwide ground-induced currents in th e transmission grid can by themselves cause system col- lapse. They did so in March 1989 in Quebec. At the levels expected in an E3 event, col- lapse would be much more likely and widespread. Loss of computer control of substation switchyard equipment could, by itself, lead to system collapse. Manual operation is possible only with adequate communication and the ability of personnel to physica lly get to the right substati ons, a problematic question in the event of an EMP attack. Adequate numb ers of trained and experienced personnel will be a serious problem even if they could al l be contacted and could make themselves available. Thus manual operation would be ne cessary and might not be timely enough or have sufficient skilled personnel to deal with a broad-scale, instan taneous disruption and dynamic situation. Loss of manual control of switchyard equipment would, in short order, lead to line and transformer faults and trips. Several substations tripping nearly simulta- neously would lead itself to system collapse. Loss of telecommunications would not, by itself, cause immediate system collapse except as needed to address issues caused by the above disruptions. However the lack of telemetered control data would make the syst em operators effectively blind to what is going on, but personnel at substations, if they can get there and communicate with the system operators, could overcome much of th at. Malfunction of prot ective relays could cause system collapse by contributing to se veral of the above scenarios through misin- formation or by operating incorrectly. All of these collapse mechanisms acting simultaneously provide the unambiguous con- clusion that electrical power system collaps e for the NERC region largely impacted by the EMP weapon is inevitable in the event of attack using even a relatively low-yield device of particular characteristics."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 37 Damage Scenarios The level of damage depends primarily on th e functioning of the protective equipment, but it also depends on various aspects of the co llapse. In an EMP event, the collapse is virtually instantaneous. The size of the tran sients on the system may be greater than existing protective systems are capable of handling, even those not damaged by the EMP itself. Damage to the large transformers and other hi gh-value equipment is directly related to protective relay failure, although it is possible for E1-induced arcs inside transformers to damage transformers irrespective of relay failu re. In general, since sequential shutdown is not required, one device per relay is a reas onable rule of thumb. A properly functioning relay has a reasonable chance of protecting the device; an improperly functioning one will probably result in some level of damage in an ensuing system collapse. The level of damage depends on the failure mode. The Co mmission-sponsored tests were focused on determining the thresholds for damage. EMP th reat levels are expected to exceed these thresholds. Test Results The EMP Commission conducted both free-field and cable current injection simulation testing. The Commission took the basic stance in its testing program that testing would determine the thresholds at which substantial failure rates (either temporary or perma- nent) commenced to appear. These, in turn, we re used to index attack severities at which the corresponding U.S. infrastructures would be seriously compromi sed or failed. The Commission’s test experience — massively supp lemented by that of other U.S. Govern- ment operations — was that failure rates t ypically increased rapi dly with peak field amplitude, once a threshold had been attained at which failure or disruption appeared at all. The rationale for such threshold determin ing testing was that ab rupt and synchronized loss of only a few percent of items such as el ectric power system relays would have grave impacts on the functionality of the system containing such items. This is much like the effect that a few percent of vehicles on a freeway that beco me disabled would have, pro- ducing a serious deleterious imp act on the flow of traffic. A crude rule of thumb was that roughly a factor-of-ten increa se in damage effects might be expected when the peak field amplitude was doubled; the exact scaling relation natu- rally varied from one device t ype to another and also had ve ry substantial dependence on the frequency content of the pulse, whic h however, the Commi ssion testing program explored only slightly. Based on the testing and analysis outlined in this chapter, we estimate that a substantial and highly significant fraction of all contro l and protective systems within the EMP- affected area will experience some type of impact. As the test results were briefed to industry experts at NERC and the Argonne National Laborator y, it became apparent to the Commission that even minor effects noted during the te sting could have significant impacts on the processes and equipment being controlled. Free-Field Testing EMP free-field simulation testing was conduc ted using a bounded wave simulator (see figure 2-4 ). The testing was conducted in three phases. Phase I was dedicated to evaluating the so- called transfer response for the various test systems.

Electric Power 38 system and provides insight into the expected fraction of the energy in an EMP field that may be deposited into the expos ed electronic device. Induced current transients were measured on all the accessible cables of th e control systems and measurements were made at the lowest field levels produced by th e simulator to minimize the electrical stress on the exposed equipment. Phases II and III of the testing program were focused on obtaining data on fragilities, that is, on identifying the thresholds for induced malfunction or damage response in the tested equipment. A total of eight steps were selected that Figure 2-4. EMP Simulator gradually increased the electrical stress on th e control systems. During this testing, all systems were operational with diagnostics and checkouts run at the conclusion of each simulated EMP exposure. The simulation testing provided an opportunity to observe th e interaction of the elec- tromagnetic energy with equipment in an operational mode. Observed effects can be related to the system respons e in more realistic scenario s through analysis based on cou- pling differences between the simulated and re al-world cases. Since the simulation is not perfect — the pulse length is t oo long and the test volume too small to capture the longer cable run couplings to be found in a real environment — post test analysis and engineer- ing judgment is required to rela te the test results to expect ed SCADA vulnerabilities in a true EMP event. There is also no pretense that any test pr ogram could possibly do more than selectively sample the wide variety of in stalled SCADA systems. The c hoice of representative test systems was guided by findings from previous infrastructure site surveys, by solicited recommendations from industry groups such as the NERC, and by conducting a review of several market surveys. In the end, four separate c ontrol systems were acquired fo r testing. These systems were representative of those f ound in power transmission, distribution, power generation, and oil and gas distribution for fueling power plants. A key observation from this test program is that a wide variety of SCADA, DCS, and PLC malfunctions resulted when exposed to simulated threshold level EMP environ- ments. These ranged from electronic upset of equipment, which might be repaired by"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 39 either reboot or recycle to phys ical damage that required th e actual replacement of the affected hardware. The response of the control systems tested va ried from system to system as well as from subsystem to subsystem. For example, a unit consisting of multiple input/output ports (or subsystems) connected to a variety of field or communications devices had some ports experience upsets, some experien ce physical damage, and some experience no effect, all in the same simulation event. As an example, at relatively low electroma gnetic stress levels, a portion of a DCS proc- ess controller provided false indications of the process status. An operator interface indi- cated a switch was on when in actuality it had be en turned off, while internal voltage and temperature were reported as out of their normal operating ranges when they were actu- ally normal. These effects were significant because they occurred most frequently on control systems used in SCADA applications , which are geographically dispersed. Cor- recting these malfunctions typically had to be performed manually at the device location. This approach would greatly complicate the recovery process for geographically distrib- uted systems. In addition to false readings from the sensor s, direct malfunctions of some tested con- trol elements were also noted. Additional control element effects included the failure of pressure transmitters, which included both phys ical damage and loss of calibration data required to indicate proper readings. Control systems often rely on Ethernet for communications to the man-machine inter- face as well as communications between cont rollers in dispersed systems. Communica- tions systems based on Ethernet components similar to those found in PC networking systems suffered substantial degradation and damage effects when illuminated by the simulated albeit low-level EMP pulse. These da mage effects are significant since they require the systems to be physic ally repaired or replaced in order to restore the normal communications capabilities. Many of the effects noted in the previous pa ragraphs are attributed to the coupling to the wires and cables interconnecting the syst ems. The level of this coupling scales roughly with the length of the wire. As a genera l rule, the larger the transients are in the coupling lines, the more damaging they are to electronics equipment. It is therefore important to consider the tran sients that might be induced if a more distributed system encounters the same EMP electromagnetic energ y. One way to address this concern is to perform cable coupling analysis. This was done as part of th e current injection test pro- gram in order to relate the susceptibility le vels of electronic equipm ent to the EMP threat. At the system level, 100 percent of the contro l systems were affected at times. This is highly relevant to the prospect of system collapse and scop e of the problem of restora- tion. This is more difficult to quantify at th e subsystem level due to the sheer number of subsystems associated with each system. Tran slation to real world conditions must be tempered in cases where the control systems are located in structures that provide elec- tromagnetic shielding of the incident EMP en ergy, but few of these exist in practice. Current Injection Testing Current injection testing was typically done by introducing transien t voltage waveforms on a cable leading to the equi pment under test. Depending on its load and that of the test generator, current was delivered to the test object. All of the el ectronics found in the power system is developed using a national (A NSI/IEEE) or interna tional (IEC) standard"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 40 for a series of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) waveforms that are representative of the transients observed during normal operati on. One waveform that is commonly tested is known as the electrical fast transient (EFT). It has a rise time of 5 ns and a pulse width of 50 ns. By coincidence, this is very simila r to the type of waveform coupled to cables by E1. The objective of this testing was to determine at what level each type of equipment fails to operate normally and also to determine when operator intervention is necessary for the equipment to operate normally. Most of the equipment tested had multiple cable connec- tions, covering different functi ons (power, signal, communicati ons, etc.). These were all tested. Given the levels of voltage in which the e quipment malfunctioned, a separate effort was performed to compute the coupling of the inci dent E1 to cables with various lengths and orientations. For the long, exposed cables f ound in transmission substations, it was found that the induced voltage could ex ceed 20 kV under many circumstances. In addition to free-field test ing, the Commission sponsored a current injection testing program. The test program was representative in the sense that exemplars of most func- tional components were tested. Due to expense and time constraints, typically only one or two vendors’ equipment was tested, and only one or two samples of a type were tested. The types of equipment tested and results br ief are described in the following paragraphs: E E l l e e c c t t r r o o - - m m e e c c h h a a n n i i c c a a l l r r e e l l a a y y s s . . These are the old-fashioned de vices that contain no inte- grated circuits but function us ing high-power relays. They ar e still used in about 50 per- cent of applications, but that share is continuing to decline. As expected, these are immune to EMP upset up to th e highest levels tested. D D i i s s t t r r i i b b u u t t i i o o n n l l i i n n e e i i n n s s u u l l a a t t o o r r s s . . Earlier studies have indicate d low vulnerability for these simple devices. The Commission-sponsored test s on a variety of 15kV class pin and sus- pension insulators indicate that there is a higher vulnerab ility than previously thought New tests performed with the power on found that some insulators were destroyed due to the current following the path of the E1-indu ced arc. Statistical testing was not per- formed, so it is not clear what percentage of insulators will behave in this fashion; how- ever, it is clear that power-on testing should be performed in the future to better under- stand this effect.

These devices (see figure 2-5 ) are the essential elements preserving high-value transmission equipment from damage during geomagnetic storms and other modes of grid collapse. Fortunately, these test items were the most robust of any of the electronic devices tested. How- ever, test agencies reported that they are s ubject to upset at highe r levels of simulated EMP exposure. We believe that altering the deployment configurations can further ame- liorate the residual problems. Figure 2-5.

These units are most commonly found in industrial settings and in particular are extensively used in power plants. They are subject to upset and damage at moderate levels of EMP assault (see figure 2-6 ).

These were the most susceptible to damage or upset of all the test articles. Unlike the other kinds of devices tested, several differe nt models and vintages were examined. The RS-232 ports were found to be particularly su sceptible, even at very low levels of EMP stress. With the exception of the RS-232 connections, all of the electronic devices that were tested performed up to the manufacturer’s cl aimed levels for electromagnetic compatibil- ity. Thus, the international standards to whic h the manufacturers subscribe are being met. Unfortunately the induced E1 stress is hi gher than the standards for normal operation. The net result of this testing provides evidence that the power grid is also vulnerable to collapse due to the E1 component of an EM P assault, primarily through the upset and damage of the soft computer systems that ar e in common use. This however suggests that operational performance can be considerably enhanced at modest cost by attending to installation and configuration issues. Historical Insights To provide insight into the potential impact of EMP-induc ed electronic system mal- functions, the Commission evaluate d previous large service failure events. In these cases, similar (and less severe) system malfunctions have produced conseque nces in situations that were far too complex to pr edict using a model or analysis. Another important observation is that these s ituations are seldom the result of a single factor but rather a combination of unexpect ed events, which are easily related to the impact only in hindsight. This is not surpri sing given the complex ity, interdependency, and size of the systems involved. It is important to note that historical examples, while necessary for the insight they provide into the dependence of a functioning modern infra- structure on its automated control systems, do not remotely capture the scale of the expected EMP scenario. In an EMP event, it is not one or a few SC ADA systems that are malfunctioning (the typical historical scenario ) but very large numb ers, hundreds or even thousands over a huge geographic area with a significant fraction of those rendered per- manently inoperable until replaced or physical ly repaired. Critically, the systems that would identify what components are damage d and where they are located are also unavailable in many instances. Hurricane Katrina, August 2005. Hurricane Katrina, one of the worst U.S. natural disasters ever, caused a widespread, multi-st ate blackout that lasted for a prolonged period, with catastrophic conse quences for the afflicted regi on. The Katrina blackout was Figure 2-6. Flashover Observed During Injection Pulse Testing"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 42 a major factor in the failure of police, em ergency and rescue services during the hurri- cane, which killed 1,464 people. The blackout caused gas stations to cease operating, paralyzing transportation and greatly impedi ng evacuation efforts. The Katrina blackout, which afflicted the region for weeks and lasted for months in some localities, so severely impeded recovery efforts that even today, 3 y ears later, New Orleans and its vicinity is still far from being fully recovered. August 14, 2003, Blackout. The August 14 blackout was precipitated by a single line failure in one control area. It eventually a ffected nine control ar eas over a period of sev- eral hours, with rapidly spreading cascades of outage over the last 30 minutes. The extent of the blackout was exacerbate d by deficiencies in specific practices, equipment, and human decisions. Initial retros pectives have focused on thre e likely contributory causes:  Inadequate situational awareness at First Energy Corporation (FEC)  FEC’s failure to adequately manage tree gr owth in its transmission rights-of-way  Failure of the interconnected grid’s reli ability organizations to provide effective diagnostic support. The inadequate situational awareness and failu re to provide effective diagnostic support are closely aligned to the computer and netw ork effects that showed damage and upset during EMP testing. Additionally, new causal features (not common to other blackout incidents) of the August 14 blackout include inadequate interregional visibility over the power system, dysfunction of a control area ’s SCADA system, and lack of adequate backup capability to that system. Thus, all of the factors involved in the August 14 black- out are expected to be present in control areas impacted by an EMP event, but to a far greater extent. Therefore, an event as large as the ultimate August 14 blackout could be part of an initial EMP impact but multiplied several times over a contiguous geographical and system area. If this eff ect overlapped the Eastern and Western Interconnections, there is the increased probab ility that both interconne ctions could collapse. Western States Blackout. The 1996 Western States blackou t occurred when an electri- cally loaded transmission line sagged onto a tree and caused a short. Th is type of event is not uncommon, especially in the heavily tr eed areas of the Western Interconnect. At about the same time, a second line tripped ( opened) due to imprope r protective relay acti- vation. The tripping of the two transmission lin es, coupled with a heavy electrical load on these lines and the thin margins on the transmission system, triggered the widespread outage through cascading failure. An EMP event c ould be expected to re sult in the loss of numerous transmission lines at once, not just the two cited in this case. Geomagnetic Storms. Probably one of the most famous and severe effects from solar storms occurred on March 13, 1989. On this da y, several major imp acts occurred to the power grids in North America and the United Kingdom. This included the complete blackout of the Hydro-Quebec power system and damage to two 400/275 kV autotrans- formers in southern England. In addition, at the Salem nuclear power plant in New Jer- sey, a 1200 MVA, 500 kV transformer was dama ged beyond repair when portions of its structure failed due to thermal stress. Th e failure was caused by stray magnetic flux impinging on the transformer core. Fortunately , a replacement transformer was readily available; otherwise the plant would have been down for a year, which is the normal delivery time for larger power transformers. The two autotransformers in southern Eng- land were also damaged from stray flux that pr oduced hot spots, whic h caused significant gassing from the breakdown of the insulating oil."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 43 The blackout of the Hydro-Quebec system wa s caused when seven static voltage-amps reactive (VAR) compensators (SVC) tripped a nd shut down due to increased levels of harmonics on the power lines. The loss of th e seven SVCs led to voltage depression and frequency increase on the system, which caused part of the Qu ebec grid to collapse. Soon afterwards, the rest of the grid collapsed b ecause of the abrupt loss of load and genera- tion. The blackout took less than 90 seconds to occur after the first SVC tripped. About 6 million people were left without power for several hours and, even 9 hours later, there were still 1 million people without power. Geomagnetic storms represent an approximati on to an E3-induced voltage effect. The experience to date is of events that may be orders of magnitude smaller in scope and less severe than that expected from an EM P — although the Commissi on has also investi- gated the impact of a 100-year superstorm. Th e induced geomagnetic superstorm currents in the transmission lines will cause hundreds of high voltage transformers to saturate, creating a severe reactive load in the power system leading to voltage collapse in the affected area and damage to elements of the transmission system. The nature of this threat did not allow for experime ntal testing of the E3 effect, so this historical record is the best information on the effect. Distinctions Past electric power blackouts provide a ba seline for assessing the impact of an EMP attack on the power grid as discussed previ ously. However, there are several important factors that distinguish the EMP collapse s cenario from these historical experiences.  In the historical power system outages, only one or a few critical elements within an entire system have been debilitated. For ex ample, a power generation facility may trip because a surge of current is unexpectedly pr esented through a fault from a particular load. Yet a substantial portion of the system may well be rendered out of service as the disruption triggers a series of cascading failu res, each instigating the next failure (e.g., first a generator trips, then the frequency sags, and a load trips off or a transmission line trips out with its associated loads, which in turn causes the frequency to overrun and another generator trips out, and it contin ues to oscillate until the interconnected system comes down.) In the case of an EM P attack, elements within many critical facility components are likely to be damage d or disrupted simultaneously over a rela- tively broad geographic area, thus creating an almost certain cascading collapse of the remaining elements. Similarly, while lightning might strike a single plant, transmission line, or large load causing it to trip out, lightning has not hit multiple locations spread over a very wide area of the system with su fficient intensity and hitting all simultane- ously to the extent that would be representative of an EMP attack.  During historical outages, the telecommunica tions system and associated control sys- tems have continued to function. This prov ides the system opera tors with eyes and ears to know what was damaged, where damage occurred and in some cases the range of damage. While the power system may still come down, it is more possible to take protective measures to minimize damage and im pact in order to effectuate rapid resto- ration. The communications and control systems’ functionality are at high risk of dis- ruption and damage themselves during an EMP attack. A minimum communications capability is needed to support immediate responses, to isolate parts for continued operation, and to implement necessary measur es to restore the electrical system.  In the early stages of the EMP attack, even before the disruptions could be sensed and trips could occur that would lead to collapse, some or many of the protective devices"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 44 will be damaged that have ensured critical system components are safe to allow fast recovery. As a result, some and perhaps mu ch of the electrical system would not be able to protect itself from the effects of multiple simultaneous and cascading failures. Widespread damage to the generation, tran smission, and distribution infrastructures and equipment are probable. Rather than si mply restoring power to an intact infra- structure with only a very few damaged comp onents, the recovery task would be to replace an extensively damaged system under very difficult and decaying circum- stances and then proceeding to restoration.  The control systems would be damaged to so me extent as opposed to remaining fully operational as in historical outages. The opera tions and dispatch centers where the vast interconnected system is controlled and managed would probably have damaged and disrupted components, the read ings from the system would be fragmented and in many cases false or nonexistent, and communicati on by whatever means would be difficult to impractical to impossibl e. Control and knowledge woul d range from unreliable at best to simply nonexistent. Finding what and where damage has occurred and getting it repaired would be very problematic in any reasonable time frame, even within the control centers themselves, let alone out over the vast network with millions of devices.  Skilled labor for a massive and diverse repair effort is not currently available if allo- cated over a large geographic area with gr eat numbers of components and devices to check and repair where necessary. This sc ope of damage could cover perhaps 70 per- cent or possibly more of the continental United States as well as a significant part of Canada’s population. This is far too large to bring in the limited skilled labor from very distant points outside the affected area in any reasonable time, even if one could coordinate them and knew where to send th em, and they had the means to get there. Thus the extensive support from nearby fringe areas used so effectively in historical outages is likely to be unavailable as a pr actical matter as they themselves would be affected. The blackout result ing from Hurricane Katrina, an event comparable to a small EMP attack, overtaxed the ability of th e Nation to quickly restore electric power, a failure that contributed to the sl ow recovery of the afflicted region.  Other infrastructures would be similarly impacted simultaneously with the electrical system such as transportation, communicati on, and even water and food to sustain crews. The ability to find a nd get spare parts and compon ents or purchase services would be severely hampered by lack of normal financial systems in addition to com- munication, transportation, and other factor s. The Hurricane Katrina blackout caused precisely such problems.  Fuel supplies for the power generation would be interrupt ed. First, the SCADA and DCS systems used in delivery of the fuel would be adversely impacted. In addition, much of the fuel supply infrastructure is dependent upon the electrical system. For example, natural gas-fired plants (which make up such a large share of the domestic generation) would be rendered i noperable since their fuel is delivered just in time for use. Coal plants have stockpiles that vari ously might be adequate for a week to a month. The few remaining oil-fired plants similarly have a limited storage of fuel. Nuclear plants would reasonably be expected to still have fuel but they would have to forego protective regulations to continue to operate. Many renewable fueled resources would still have their fuel supply but EMP effects on controls may still render them inoperable."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 45 It is not possible to precisely predict the tim e to restore even minimal electrical service due to an EMP eventuality given the number of unknowns and the vast size and com- plexity of the system with its consequent fragility and resiliency. Expert judgment and rational extrapolation of models and predictiv e tools suggest that re storation to even a diminished but workable state of electrica l service could well take many weeks, with some probability of it taking months and perh aps more than a year at some or many loca- tions; at that point, society as we know it couldn’t exist within large regions of the Nation. The larger the affected area and the stronger the field streng th from the attack (corollary to extent of damage or disrupt ion), the longer will be the time to recover. Restoration to current standards of electri c power cost and reli ability would almost certainly take years with severe impact on the economy and all that it entails. Strategy The electrical system must be protected ag ainst the consequences of an EMP event to the extent reasonably possible. The level of vulnerability and extreme consequence com- bine to invite an EMP att ack. Thus reduction of our vulnerability to attack and the resulting consequences reduces the probability of attack. It is also clear the Cold War type of deterrence through mutual assured dest ruction is not an effective threat against many of the potential protagon ists, particularly those who are not identifiable nation- states. The resulting strategy is to reduce sharply th e risk of adverse consequences from an EMP attack on the electrical system as ra pidly as possible. The two key elements of the mitigation strategy for the electrical system are protection and restoration. The initial focus for reducing adverse cons equences should be on the restoration of overall electrical system performance to meet critical, if not general, societal needs. The focus should be on the system as a whole and not on individual components of the sys- tem. Timely restoration depends on protecti on, first of high-value assets, protection nec- essary for the ability to restore service quickly to strategically importa nt loads, and finally protection as required to restore electrical service to all loads. The approach is to utilize a comprehensive, strategic approach to achieve an acceptable risk-weighted protection in terms of performance, schedule, timing, and cost. The effort will include evolution to greater and greater levels of protection in an orderly and co st-effective manner consistent with the anticipated threat level. Where possi ble, the protection also will enhance normal system reliability and, in so doing, provi de great service to society overall. There is a point in time at which the shorta ge or exhaustion of cr itical items like emer- gency power supply, batteries, standby fuel su pplies, replacement parts, and manpower resources which can be coordinated and dispat ched, together with the degradation of all other infrastructures and their systemic impact, all lead toward a collapse of restoration capability. Society will transition into a situ ation where restoration needs increase with time as resources degrade and disappear. This is the most serious of all consequences and thus the ability to restore is paramount. Protection It is not practical to try to protect the enti re electrical power system or even all high- value components from damage by an EMP ev ent. There are too ma ny components of too many different types, manufactures, ages, a nd designs. The cost and time would be pro- hibitive. Widespread collapse of the electri cal power system in the area affected by EMP is virtually inevitable after a broad geographic EMP attack, with even a modest number"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 46 of unprotected components. Since this is a give n, the focus of protection is to retain and restore service to critical loads whil e permitting relatively rapid restoration. The approach to protection has the followi ng fundamental aspects. These will collec- tively reduce the recovery and restoration times and minimize the net impact from assault. All of this is feasib le in terms of cost and timing if done as part of a comprehen- sive and reasonable response to the threats, whether the assault is physical, electromag- netic (such as EMP), or cyber. 1. Protect high-value assets through hard ening. Hardening, providing for special grounding, and other schemes are required to assure the functiona l operation of pro- tection equipment for large hi gh-value assets such as transformers, breakers, and gen- erators and to so protect against sequential, subsequent impacts from E2 and E3 cre- ating damage. Protection through hardening crit ical elements of the natural gas trans- portation and gas supply systems to key power plants th at will be necessary for elec- trical system recovery is imperative. 2. Assure there are adequate communication asse ts dedicated or avai lable to the electri- cal system operators so that damage dur ing system collapse can be minimized; com- ponents requiring human interven tion to bring them on-line ar e identified and located; critical manpower can be contacted and di spatched; fuel, spare parts and other com- modities critical to the elect rical system restoration can be allocated; and provide the ability to match generation to load and bring the system back on line. 3. Protect the use of emergency power supp lies and fuel delivery, and importantly, pro- vide for their sustained use as part of the protection of critical loads, which loads must be identified by government but can also be assured by private action. Specifically: — Increase the battery and on-site genera ting capability for key substation and con- trol facilities to extend the critical period allowing recovery. This is relatively low cost and will improve reliability as well as provide substantial protection against all forms of attack. — Require key gasoline and dies el service stations and dist ribution facilities in geo- graphic areas to have at-site generation, fu eled off existing tanks, to assure fuel for transportation and other services, incl uding refueling emergency generators in the immediate area. — Require key fueling stations for the railro ads to have standby generation, similar to that required for service sta tions and distribu tion facilities. — Require the emergency generator star t, operation, and interconnection mecha- nisms to be EMP hardened or manual. This will also require the ability to isolate these facilities from the main electrical power system during emergency genera- tion operation and such isolation switching must be EMP hardened. — Make the interconnection of diesel electri c railroad engines a nd large ships possi- ble and harden such capability, includi ng the continued operation of the units. — The Government must determine and sp ecify immediately those strategically important electrical loads cri tical to the Nation to preser ve in such an emergency. 4. Separate the present interconnected systems, particularly the Ea stern Interconnection, into several nonsynchronous connected subregions or electrical isla nds. It is very important to protect the ability of the system to retain as much in operation as possi- ble through reconfiguration par ticularly of the Eastern C onnected System into a num- ber of nonsynchronous connected regions, so disruptions will not cascade beyond those EMP-disrupted areas. Basically, this means eliminating total NERC region ser- vice loss, while at the same time maintaini ng the present interconnection status with"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 47 its inherent reliability and commercial elemen ts. This is the most practical and easiest way to allow the system to break into islands of service and greatly enhance restora- tion timing. This will not protect most within the EMP-insult area, but it should increase the amount of viable fringe areas remaining in op eration. This is fiscally efficient and can leverage efforts to improve reliability and enhance security against the broader range of threats, not only EMP. It also can be beneficial to normal system reliability. 5. Install substantially more black start gene ration units coupled with specific transmis- sion that can be readily isolated to ba lancing loads. The NERC regions now do sur- veys of available black start and fuel switchable generation. Requiring all power plants above a certain significant size to ha ve black start or fu el-switching capability (with site-stored fuel) would be a very sm all added expense that would provide major benefits against all disruptions including nona dversarial ones. Blac k start generator, operation, and interconnection mechanisms must be EMP hardened or be manual without microelectronic dependence. This also will require the ability to isolate these facilities from the main electrical powe r system during emergency generation opera- tion and that isolation switching is EMP harden ed. In addition, sufficient fuel must be provided, as necessary, to substantially e xpand the critical pe riod for recovery. 6. Improve, extend, and exercise recovery capab ilities. Develop procedures for address- ing the impact of such atta cks to identify weak nesses, provide training for personnel and develop EMP response training procedur es and coordinate all activities and appropriate agencies and industry. While developing response plans, training and coordination are the primary purpose. Recovery and Restoration The key to minimizing catastrophic impacts fr om loss of electrical power is rapid resto- ration. The protective strategy de scribed is aimed primarily at preserving the system in a recoverable state after the atta ck, maintaining service to critical loads, and enhancing recovery. The first step in recovery is identifying the extent and nature of the damage to the sys- tem and then implementing a comprehensive plan with trained personnel and a reservoir of spare parts to repair the damage. Damage is defined as anything that requires a trained person to take an action with a component, which can include simply rebooting all the way to replacing major internal elements of the entire component. A pr iority schedule for repair of generation, transmission, and even di stribution is necessary since resources of all types will be precious and in short s upply should the EMP impact be broad enough and interdependent infrastructures be a dversely impacted (e .g., communication, trans- portation, financial and li fe-supporting functions). Restoration is complicated in the best of circumstances, as experienced in past black- outs. In the instance of EMP attack, th e complications are magnified by the unprece- dented scope of the damage bot h in nature and geographical ex tent, by the lack of infor- mation post attack, and by the concurrent and interrelated impact on other infrastructures impeding restoration. Restoration plans for priority loads are a key focus. Widely scattered or single or small group loads are in most cases impractical to isolate and restore individually given the nature of the electrical syst em. These are to be served first through the emergency power supply aspects identified in th e Protection section. Restora tion of special islands can,"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 48 however, be made practical by the nonsynchro nous connected subreg ions if they are identified by the Government as necessary very far in advan ce of any assault. Otherwise, the system’s resources and available personnel will need to act expeditiously to get as many islands of balanced load and generati on back into operation. This will begin by system operators identifying those easiest to repair (normally the least damaged) and restore them first. As these st abilize, the system recovery wi ll flow outward as, increment by increment, the system is repaired and brought back in service. It is much more feasible and practical to restore by adding incrementall y to an operating island rather than black starting the recovery for an island. Balancing an isolated portion of generation an d load first, and then integrating each new increment is a reasonably difficult and tim e-consuming process in the best of cir- cumstances. In an EMP attack with multiple damaged components, related infrastructure failures, and difficulty in communications, re storing the system could take a very long time unless preparatory action is taken. Generating plants have several advantages over the widely spread transmission network as it relates to protection and restoration from an EMP event. The plant is one complete unit with a single DCS control network. It is manned in mo st cases so operators and maintenance personnel are immediately availa ble and on site. The operating environment electronically requires a level of protection th at may provide at least a minimal protection against EMP. Nevertheless, it is important to harden critical controls sufficiently to enable manual operation at a minimum. Providi ng for at-site spares to include the proba- bly needed replacements for control of operatio n and safety would be straightforward and not expensive to accomplish, thus assisting rapid restoration of capability. As controls and other critical components of the electrical tran smission and generation system suffer damage, so do similar components on the production, processing, and delivery systems providing fuel to the electric generators. Re storation of the electrical power system is not feasible on a wide scale without a parallel restor ation of these fuel processing and delivery systems. Hydropower, wind, geothermal, and solar power each has a naturally reoccurring fuel supply that is unaffected by EMP. However, th e controls of these plants themselves are subject to damage by EMP at present. In addition, only hydropower and geothermal have controllable fuel (i.e. they can operate when needed versus wind a nd solar that operate when nature provides the fuel just-in-time). As a practical matter, only hydropower is of sufficient size and controllability in some re gions to be a highly effective resource for restoration, such as the Pacific Northwest, the Ohio/Tennessee valley, and northern Cali- fornia. Beyond the renewable resources, coal and wood waste plants typically have sig- nificant stockpiles of fuel so the delay in ra il and other delivery sy stems for a couple of weeks and in some instances up to a month is not an issue for fuel. Beyond that, rail and truck fuel will be needed and delivery times are often relatively slow, so the delivery process must start well before the fuel at the generator runs out. Operating nuclear plants do not have a fuel problem per se, but th ey are prohibited by regulation from operating in an environmen t where multiple reliable power supply sources are not available for safe shutdown, wh ich would not be available in this circum- stance. However, it is physically feasible and safe for nuclear plants to operate in such a circumstance since they all have emergency gene ration at site. It would simply have to be fueled sufficiently to be in operation when th e nuclear plant is opera ting without external"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 49 electrical supply sources. Nuclear power backup would need to be significantly expanded. Natural gas-fired power plants are very important in restoration because of their inherent flexibility and often their relati vely small size, yet they have no on-site fuel storage and are totally dependent upon the natural gas supply a nd gas transportation system which are just in time for this purpose. Therefore, the natural gas fuel delivery system must be brought back on-line before th ese power plants can f easibly operate. It is operated largely with gas turbines of its ow n along the major pipelines. The key will be to have the protection, safety, and cont rols be hardened against EMP. Recovery from transmission system damage and power plant damage will be impeded primarily by the manufacture and delivery of long lead-time components. Delivery time for a single, large transformer today is typi cally one to two years and some very large special transformers, critical to the system, are even l onger. There are roughly 2,000 transformers in use in the transmission syst em today at 345 kV and above with many more at lesser voltages that are only slightly less critical. No tran sformers above 100 kV are produced in the United States any longer. The current U.S. replacement rate for the 345 kV and higher voltage units is 10 per ye ar; worldwide production capacity of these units is less than 100 per year. Spare tran sformers are available in some areas and systems, but because of the unique requirements of each transformer, there are no stan- dard spares. The spares also are owned by in dividual utilities and not generally available to others due to the risk over the long lead time if they are being used. Transformers that will cover several options are very expensiv e and are both large and hard to move. NERC keeps a record of all spare transformers. Recovery will be limited by the rate of tes ting and repair of SCADA, DCS, and PLC and protective relay systems. With a large, co ntiguous area affected, the availability of outside assistance, skilled manpower, and spares may well be negligible in light of the scope of the problem. Information from pow er industry representa tives enables us to place some limits on how long the testing and repair might take. Determining the source of a bad electrical signal or tiny component that is not work ing can take a long time. On the low side, on-site relay tec hnicians typically take three weeks for initial shakedown of a new substation. Simply replacing whole units is much faster, but here too, inserting new electronic devices and ensuring the whole syst em works properly is still time consuming. It must be noted that the substations are t ypically not manned so skilled technicians must be located, dispatched, and reach the site wh ere they are needed. Many of these locations are not close to the technicians. It is not possible to readily estimate the time it will take in the event of an EMP attack since the afte rmath of an EMP attack would not be routine and a certain level of risk woul d likely be accepted to accele rate return to service. It seems reasonable, then, to estimate an entire substation control system recovery time to be at least several days, if not weeks. This assumes that the trained personnel can reach the damaged locations and will be suppor ted with water, food, communication, spare parts, and the needed electr onic diagnostic equipment. Unlike generation, recovery of the transmission system will require off-site communi- cations because coordination between remote locations is necessary. Communications assets used for this purpose now include dedicated microwave systems and, increasingly, cell phones and satellite systems. If faced wi th a prolonged outage of the telecommunica- tions infrastructures, repairs to dedicated communication systems or establishment of new ad-hoc communications will be necessary. This might take one or more weeks and"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 50 would set a lower limit on recovery time, but it would be unlikely to affect the duration of a months-long outage. Restoration to electrical service of a wide ly damaged power system is complex. Begin- ning with a total blackout, it requires adequa te communication to ma tch and coordinate a generating plant to a load with an interconnected transmission that normally can be iso- lated via switching at several s ubstations, so it is not affect ed by other loads or genera- tion. The simultaneous loss of communication a nd power system controls and the result- ing lack of knowledge about th e location of the damage all greatly complicate restoration. There are also a diminishing number of opera tors who can execute the processes neces- sary for restoration without the aid of computers and system controls. Without communication, both voice and data li nks, it is nearly impossible to ascertain the nature and location of damage to be repa ired, to dispatch manpower and parts, and to match generation to load. Transportation limitations further impede movement of mate- rial and people. Disruption of the financial system will make acquisition of services and parts difficult. In summary, actions are needed to assure that difficult and complex recov- ery operations can take place and be effec tive in an extraordinarily problematic post- attack environment. The recovery times for various elements of the electrical system are estimated in the following paragraphs. These should be regarded as very rough best estimates for average cases derived from the considered judgment of several experts. These estimates are gross averages, and the situation would vary greatly from one facility to another as the situa- tion, number of disrupted and damaged elements and the extent of preassault prepared- ness and training vary. In addi tion, the contingencies and b acklogs strongly depend on the extent of such damage elsewhere a nd are essentially unknown. For example, fuel delivery capability is a key element. Each of the system elements — generation (includ- ing fuel delivery), transmissi on, distribution, and of ten load — must be repaired and in working order sufficient for manual control at a minimum (each element with skilled per- sonnel all in communication with each other). Thus, the following should be occurring in parallel as much as possible, but in some instances testing of one element requires a working capability of another. The availabil ity of spare parts a nd trained manpower cou- pled with knowledge of what to repair and wh ere it is are critical to recovery timing. The recovery times provided below are predicat ed upon the assumption th at the other infra- structures are operating normally. The recove ry times would increase sharply with the absence of other operating infrastructures, which is likely in the EMP situation. These estimates are based upon presen t conditions, not what is possible if the Commission rec- ommendations are followed.

Starting an electrical power system from a fully down and black system requires one of the following two approaches. (1) At the marg in of the outage, an operating electrical system is running at proper frequency with ba lanced load to genera tion, and this system can be interconnected to the fringe of the black portion of the system. The newly inter- connected portion, the portion being restored, must be able to sequentially (in increments or simultaneously) bring on load and generati on to keep the now larger portion of the system in sufficient frequency balance so the entire system, new and old, does not col- lapse. Then another increment is integrated into the operating system and so on. As the portion that is operating in balance becomes larger and more flexible, the increments that are able to be added become larger as well, since the operating system can absorb more and maintain stability. This is how historical outage areas are pre dominantly restarted. (2) There is generation that can be black started. This means st arting a generator without an external power source, such as hydroelectric or diesel generation. To do this, the genera-"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 52 tion has to be synchronized on line, and a load has to be ma tched to the generation as it comes on line. That requires that a transmi ssion link between the ge neration and the load be put in service. Yet the transmission link also must be segregated from the rest of the system, or the load hanging on it would be to o large. Both approaches require that the increment of the system being re-energized to be fully functional (repaired) and commu- nication established between the generation a nd load, including any substation or switch- yard between the two. Importan tly, it requires skilled personne l to execute th e restoration manually. The generation must have sufficient fuel to accommodate the load being met in bal- ance. Water behind a hydroelectric facility may be limited and certainly the diesel fuel is likely to be limited. Thus the startup must be done carefully because failures could render the black start inoperable as it r uns out of fuel or depletes the battery. Normally, in this type of situation, the diesel or small hydro is used primarily to start up a larger generator of a size that can carry the necessary load increment. This larger generator must be fueled, which can be a complication as discussed elsewhere in this chapter. Under deregulation, the disconnection (in the business sense) of tr ansmission from gen- eration that has been occurring in the U.S. electrical power busine ss creates a problem for black start recovery. There are risks involved in returning a plant to operation and costs for the needed repairs. Questions about who will pay whom and who will follow whose direction is not easy to answer, even w ith everybody wanting to cooperate. Under the historic utility monopolies, the generation and the transmission assets had a common owner, so these matters were handled with in a single organization. Now, coordination with independent power producers is nearly unenforceable other than through heavy government emergency powers noting that power producers and owners want indemnification before assuming risk. Ther efore some degree of command authority is required for coordination, assessment, and acce ptance of risk of damage and financial settlement of losses. The time to integrate sufficient portions of a black region of the system using the fringe approach is reasonably short if the outage area is small in relation to the operating area as has been seen in past outage conditions. In the case of EMP, where the outage area is likely to be much larger than the fringe area or there is no fringe ar ea, restoration of even parts will be measured in weeks to months . If communication is difficult to nonexistent, restoration can take much longer. Mitigation of Adverse Consequences By protecting key system components, struct uring the network to maximize fringe ser- vice, through the nonsynchronous interconnecti ons, expanding the black start and system emergency power support, creating comprehens ive recovery plans for the most critical power needs, and providing adequate training of personnel, the risk of catastrophic impact to the Nation can be significantly re duced. The mitigation plan must be jointly developed by the Federal Government and th e electric power industr y, instilled into sys- tems operations, and practiced to maintain a r eady capability to respond. It must also be fully coordinated with the interdependent infrastructures, owners, and producers. The continuing need to improve and expand the electric power system as a normal course of business provides an opportunity to judiciously improve both security and reli- ability in an economically acceptable manner — provided that technically well-informed decisions are made with accepted priorities. There are a wide variety of potential threats"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 53 besides EMP that must be addressed, which can have serious to potentially catastrophic impacts on the electrical system. Common solu tions must be found that resolve these multiple vulnerabilities as much as possible. Fo r example, in the course of its work, the Commission analyzed the impact of a 100-year solar storm (similar to E3 from EMP) and discovered a very high consequence vulnerability of the power grid. Steps taken to miti- gate the E3 threat also would simultaneously mitigate this threat from the natural envi- ronment. Most of the precautions identified to protect and restore the system from EMP will also apply to cyber and physical attacks. The Commission notes that the solutions must not seriously penalize our existing and excellent system but should enhance its per- formance wherever possible. The time for action is now. Threat capabiliti es are growing and infrastructure reinvest- ment is increasingly needed which creates an opportunity for the investment to serve more than one purpose. Government must ta ke responsibility for improvements in secu- rity. As a general matter, improvements in sy stem security are a Government responsibil- ity, but it may also enhance re liability if done in certain ways. For example, providing spare parts, more black start capabilit y, greater emergency back-up, nonsynchronous interconnections, and more training all will do so. Yet, EMP hardening components will not increase reliability or enhance operati on. Conversely improving reliability does not necessarily improve security, but it may if done properly. For example, adding more electronic controls will not enhance EMP security, but elec tronic spare parts and more skilled technicians will help improve securi ty and reliability. Finding the right balance between the utility or independe nt power producer’s service a nd fiscal respons ibility with the Government’s security obligation as soon as possible is essential, and that balance must be periodically (almost continuously) reexamined as technology and system archi- tecture changes. Recommendations EMP attack on the electrical power system is an extraordinarily serious problem but one that can be reduced below the level of a catastrophic nationa l consequence through focused effort coordinated be tween industry and government. Industry is responsible for assuring system reliability, efficiency, and cost effectiveness as a matter of meeting required service levels to be paid for by it s customers. Government is responsible for protecting the society and its infrastructure, including the electric power system. Only government can deal with barr iers to attack — interdictio n before consequence. Only government can set the standards necessary to provide the appropriate level of protection against catastrophic damage from EMP for the civilian sector. Government must validate related enhancements to systems, fund secu rity-only related elements, and assist in funding others. It must be noted, however, that the areas wh ere reliability and security interact repre- sent the vast majority of cases. The power system is a complex amalgamation of many individual entities (public, re gulated investor-owned, and priv ate), regulatory structures, equipment designs, types and ages (with some parts well over one hundred years old and others brand new). Therefore, the structure and approach to modifi cations must not only recognize the sharply increased threat fr om EMP and other forms of attack, but improvements must be accomplished within ex isting structures. For example, industry investment to increase transmission capacity will improve both reliability and system security during the period when transmissi on system operating margins are increased."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 54 The Commission concluded that mi tigation for a majority of the adverse impact to the electrical system from EMP is reasonable to undertake in terms of time and resources. The specific recommendations that follow have been reviewed with numerous entities with responsibility in this area. The review has been in conceptual terms, with many of the initiatives coming from these parties, but the recommendations are the Commission’s responsibility alone. The activi ties related to mitigation of adverse impacts on fuel supply to electric generation are more fully discu ssed in a separate chap ter of this report. Responsibility As a result of the formation of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with its statu- tory charter for civilian matters, coupled with the nature of EMP de rived from adversary activity, the Federal Government, acting thr ough the Secretary of Ho meland Security, has the responsibility and authority to assure th e continuation of civilia n U.S. society as it may be threatened through an EMP assault a nd other types of broa d scale seriously dam- aging assaults on the electric power in frastructure and related systems. It is vital that DHS, as early as practicable, make clear its authority and responsibility to respond to an EMP attack and delineate th e responsibilities and functioning interfaces with all other governmental in stitutions with indi vidual jurisdictions over the broad and diverse electric power system. This is necessa ry for private industry and individuals to act to carry out the necessa ry protections assigned to them a nd to sort out liability and fund- ing responsibility. DHS particularly needs to interact with FERC, NERC, state regulatory bodies, other governmental institutions at all levels, and industry in defining liability and funding relative to private and government facilities, such as independent power plants, to contribute their capability in a time of national need, yet not in terfere with market creation and operation to the maximum extent practical. DHS, in carrying out its mission, must establ ish the methods and systems that allow it to know, on a continuous basis, the state of the infrastructu re, its topology, and key ele- ments. Testing standards and measurable impr ovement metrics should be defined as early as possible and kept up to date. The NERC and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) are readily situated to provide much of what is needed to support DHS in carrying out its responsibilities. The Edison Electric Institute, the American P ublic Power Associati on, and the North Ameri- can Rural Electric Cooperative Association ar e also important components for coordi- nating activity. Independent power producers an d other industry groups normally partici- pate in these groups or have groups of their own. The manufacturers of generation, transmission, and distribution components are another key element of the industry that should be involved. Working closely with in dustry and these institutions, DHS should provide for the necessary capability to contro l the system in order to minimize self- destruction in the event of an EMP attack and to recover as rapidly and effectively as possible. Multiple Benefit Most of the recommended initiatives and actio ns serve multiple purposes and thus are not only to mitigate or protect against an EM P attack and other assaults on the electric power system. The protection of the system a nd rapid restoration of the system from an EMP attack also are effectiv e against attack from a numb er of physical threats that directly threaten to destroy or damage key components of the electrical system. Large- scale natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katr ina, also are in large part mitigated by these"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 55 same initiatives. Many of the initiatives enhanc e reliability, efficiency, and quality of the electrical supply, which is a direct benef it to the electrical consumer and the U.S. economy. To the greatest extent feasible, solutions fo r EMP should be designed to be useful solu- tions to the broad range of s ecurity and reliability challeng es. For example, black start resources are essential for many threats, purposeful or not, to the power grid. Integrating cyber security and EMP hardness into cont rol systems simultaneously as these systems are routinely upgraded will be much more effe ctive and less costly than doing two sepa- rate jobs. Recommended Initiatives The following initiatives must be implemen ted and verified by DHS and DOE, utilizing industry and other governmental institutions to assure the most cost effective outcome occurs and that it does so more rapidly than otherwise possible. In many instances, these initiatives are extensions or expansions of existing procedures and systems such as those of NERC.  Understand system and network level vulner abilities, including cascading effects —To better understand EMP-related system respons e and recovery issues, conduct in-depth research and development on system vulnerabilities. The objective is to identify cost effective and necessary modifications and a dditions in order to further achieve the overall system performance. Specifica lly there should be government-sponsored research and development of components a nd processes to identify and develop new consequential and cost effective approaches and activities.  Evaluate and implement quick fixes —Identify what may presently be available commercially to provide cost effective patc hes and snap-on modifications to quickly provide significant protection and limit dama ge to high-value generation and transmis- sion assets as well as emergency generati on and black start capability. These include installation or modification of equipment as well as changes in operating practices. This is both fast and low cost.  Develop national and regional restoration plans — The plans must prioritize the rapid restoration of power with an emphasis on restoring critical loads that are identified by the Government. The plans must be combined with the requiremen ts for providing and maintaining emergency power service by these loads. The plans must address outages with wide geographic effect, multiple component failure, poor communication capa- bility, and failure of islanding schemes w ithin the affected area. Government and industry responsibilities must be assigned and clearly delineated. Indemnification arrangements must be put into place to a llow industry to implement the Government’s priorities as well as deal with potential en vironmental and electrical hazards to ensure rapid recovery. Planning must address not only the usual contingency for return to normal operating condition, but al so restoration to a reduced capability for minimum necessary service. Service priorities unde r duress may be different from priorities under normal conditions. The planning basis for reduced capability should be the minimum necessary connectivity, generation assumptions based on reduced fuel avail- ability scenarios, and reduced load, with th e goal of universal service at limited power. National Guard and other rele vant resources and capabilit ies must be incorporated.  Assure availability of replacement equipment —On hand or readily available spare parts to repair or replace damaged electr onic and larger power system components"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 56 must be available in sufficient quantities an d in locations to allow for rapid correction and restoration commensurate with a post-EM P attack and its impacts on related infra- structures such as communication and tr ansportation. NERC already has a spare com- ponent database for such large items as tran sformers and breakers th at is expanding to include delivery capability, but now must be revised to accommodate an EMP attack environment. Where additional spare com ponents need to be acquired or delivery made possible to critical lo cations, DHS must work with NERC and industry to iden- tify the need and provide the spares or deliver y capability; such as the critical material and strategic petroleum reserves and similar strategic reserves. The key will be to decide where to draw the line between reserves for reliability and those for security. It also will be necessary to keep the equi pment current. In addition, strategic manufac- turing and repair facilities themselves might be provided with emergency generation to minimize stockpiles. This would also be of be nefit to industry as well as enhance secu- rity. Research is underway and should be further pursued, into the production of mul- tiple use emergency replacement transformers , breakers, controls, and other critical equipment. Such devices would trade effici ency and device service life for modularity, transportability and affordability. They w ould not be planned for normal use. Move- ment, stockpiles and protection of stockpiles must be integrated with National Guard and other relevant capabilities.  Assure availability of cr itical communications channels —Assure that throughout the system there are local and system-wide backup EMP survivable communication sys- tems adequate for command and control of ope rations and restorati on of the electrical system. The most critical communications chan nels are the ones that enable recovery, not normal operations. Planning must presume that, for the near term at least, com- puter-based control systems will not be capable of supporting post-EMP operations. The most critical communication assets are thus the in-house ones that enable manual operation and system diagnostics. Dispatch communication is next in importance. Communications to coordinate black start are also vita l. NERC should review and upgrade operating procedures and informa tion exchanges between and among existing control centers, key substations , and generating plants to recognize and deal as effec- tively as possible with EMP, building upon the systems, procedures, and databases currently in place. Local emergency and 9-1-1 communications centers, the National Guard and other relevant communication sy stems, and redundant capabilities should be incorporated where possible.  Expand and extend emergency power supplies —Add to the number of stand-alone back-up and emergency power supplies such as diesels and long-life batteries. This addition is vital and a least-co st protection of critical serv ice. The loss of emergency power before restoration of the external power supply is likely to occur in present cir- cumstances and is highly probable to be de vastating. Presently such emergency power is useable only for relatively short periods due mostly to at-site stored fuel limitations, which have become increasingly limited. The length of time recommended for each location and load will be determined by DHS and industry where the emergency sup- ply is private, such as w ith hospitals, financial inst itutions, and te lecommunication stations. The specific recommendations are: — Increase the battery and on-site genera ting capability for key substation and con- trol facilities to extend the critical period allowing rec overy. This action is rela- tively low cost and will improve reliability as well as provide substantial protec- tion against all forms of attack."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 57 — Require key gasoline and diesel fuel serv ice stations and liqui d fuel distribution facilities in geographic areas to have at -site generation, fueled from existing at- site storage to assure fuel for transpor tation and other services, including refueling emergency generators in the immediate area. — Require that key fueling stations for th e railroads have standby generation much as the previously mentioned service stations and distribution facilities. — Require the emergency generator star t, operation, and interconnection mecha- nisms to be EMP hardened or manual. This action will also requi re the ability to isolate these facilities from the main el ectrical power system during emergency generation operation and requi re that such isolation switching be EMP hardened. — Where within safety parameters extend the emergency generation life through greater fuel storage or supply sources (w ith their own emergency power supplies). Fuel supplies for more critical facilities must be extended to at least a week or longer, where possible. This action will pr obably entail careful use or develop- ment of relatively near location (but not contiguous) fuel stockpiles with their own emergency generation. — Regularly test and verify the emergency operations. If the Government were to enforce current regulations, many of the public facilities with standby generation would be routinely tested and failures could be avoided. — Provide for the local integration of railr oad mobile diesel el ectric units with switching and controls hardened against EMP. The same should be provided for large ships at major ports.  Extend black start capability —Systemwide black start capabilities must be assured and exercised to allow for smaller and bett er islanding and fast er restoration. The installation of substantially more black st art generations units and dual feed capable units (e.g., natural gas-fired units that can operate on #2 oil stored on site) coupled with specific transmission that can be readily isolated to balance loads for restoration is necessary. Sufficient fuel must be pr ovided to substantially expand the critical period for recovery such as with multiple start attempts. The NERC regions now do surveys of available black start and fuel switchable generation. Requiring all power plants above a certain significant size to ha ve black start or at-site fuel switching capability (with at-site stored fuel) would be a very small added expense, and would provide major benefits against all disruptions including nonadversarial, so it is both an industry and security benef it. The start, operation, and control systems for such capability have to be EMP hardened or manual, recognizing that most large power plants have personnel on site.  Prioritize and protect critical nodes — Government entities, such as DHS and DOE, must identify promptly those specific loads that are critical to eith er remain in service or to be restored as a priority with target restoration to be within a matter of hours fol- lowing an EMP attack. These may well include loads necessary to assure the con- tinuation of all forms of emergency respons e care and recovery. These must include what is necessary to avoid collapse of, or allow for the rapid recovery of financial systems, key telecommunication systems, the Government’s command and control in the civilian sector, and those elements that allow for rapid and effective recovery of the electric power system in a more general sense. These loads must be prioritized so that the most critical can be protected and designed for ra pid restoration in the near term and then add more next-level priority loads as resources permit. The above rec- ommendations for extended and adequate emer gency power supply are the most direct"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 58 and cost efficient approach. The shift to nonsynchronous, interconnected islands is the secondary application, but it will take l onger and is more expensive. Providing such islands of small-to-modest size to support larg e loads can best assure no loss of power supply or far more rapid restoration.  Expand and assure intellig ent islanding capability —Direct the electrical system institutions and entities to expand the capability of the syst em to break into islands of matching load and generation, enhancing what now exists to minimize the impact and provide for more rapid and widespread recovery. The establishment of nonsynchro- nous connections between subregions, perh aps beginning with NERC already identi- fied subregions, should be required. This can readily be accomplished today with approaches such as DC back-to-back converter installations that facilitate power trans- fers but maintain a barrier. This mode of operation between regions is often referred to as maintaining frequency independence. R econfiguration of the Eastern Connected System into a number of such nonsynchr onous connected regions could eliminate large service interruptions, while still mainta ining the present inte rconnection status. It may be a priority to first establish smaller islands of frequency independence to better assure power supply to government-identifie d critical loads that are nominally too large for most emergency power supplies, su ch as large financial centers, and tele- communication hubs. Incidental to any studies could be new ideas for conversion of HVAC transmission lines to HVDC operation for greater transmission capacity as a further and corollary benefit. Also new id eas are being discussed, such as, where the converter transformers can be eliminated, re sulting in a substant ial cost reduction. Asynchronous regional connections is a common term used to identify this broad area technically. The protective a nd control systems necessary to implement this capability will have to be hardened. It will not be a retr ofit but simply a part of the initial design and procedures, so the cost for EMP protectio n is small. Note that the DC or other interface making the nonsynchronous connecti on possible is not sized for the entire electrical capacity within th e respective island but is suffi cient only for reliability and commercial transactions, which normally is far less. Sizing this interface is a special effort that needs to be established pr imarily by NERC and FERC but with Federal coordination. Breaking the larger electrical power system into subsystem islands of matching load and generation will enhance wh at now exists to minimize the impact, decrease likelihood of broad systemwide co llapse, and provide for more rapid and widespread recovery. It is just as useful for normal re liability against random distur- bances or natural disasters in reducing size and time for blackouts. Thus it is critical for protection and restoration coming from any type of attack, not just EMP. Ensuring this islanding capability in the event of EMP is critical, although it requires a longer- term system design and implementation.  Assure protection of high-value generation assets —Enhance the survivability of generating plants at the point of system co llapse due to the very broad and simultane- ous nature of an EMP attack. NERC, EPRI, equipment and control system providers, and utilities need to aggressively evaluate and verify what is vulnerable to EMP and commensurate consequences. Generating plants can be severely damaged from large electrical faults or incursions in the abse nce of protective devices . They can also be occasionally damaged in the event of sudde n load loss if protective shutdown systems fail. Control systems used in generation faci lities are inherently less robust than their counterparts in transmission and thus are mo re susceptible to EMP disruption. They are highly computer controlled which further exacerbates thei r risk to EMP. Yet at the"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 59 same time, they have trained personnel on site who with proper training, procedures, and spare parts, can greatly assist in restor ation. System-level protection assurance is more complex due to the need for multiple systems to function in proper sequence. Lead times on generation components are ev en longer than for major transmission components. Existing coal plants make up ne arly half the Nation’ s generation, but they generally have the most robust control systems w ith many remaining electro- mechanical controls still in operation. Natu ral gas-fired combusti on turbines and asso- ciated steam secondary systems represent th e newest significant contribution to the generation. These are mostly all modern el ectronic- and compute r-based control and protective systems and are considered very vulnerable to EMP. Their fuel systems are not on site and will also be interrupted due to EMP. Nuclear plants have many redun- dant and fail-safe systems, but they too ar e very electronically controlled. The key dif- ference with nuclear power plants is th e extensive manual control capability and training, making them less vulnerable than th e others. Hydroelectric is the next sub- stantial generation element a nd is the most robust, alt hough its older mechanical and electromechanical controls are being replaced at a rapid rate. Black start generation is normally quite secure but start and frequency controls will need to be protected from EMP. The highest priority gene ration assets are those needed for black start, but all are critical for restoration of any meaningful service.  Assure protection of high-value transmission assets —Ability to withstand EMP must be assured at the system level. Priority fo r protection is on the highest voltage, and on the highest power units serving the longest lin es; these require the most time to replace and are the most vulnerable in the absence of normal protections due to E1 and pro- vide the major flow and delivery of power. Pr ovisions must be made for the protection of large high-value assets such as transf ormers and breakers against the loss of protection and sequential subsequent impact s from E2 and E3 creating damage. E3 ground-induced current impacts are important from an industry standpoint since they can occur beyond E3 due to the risk of large, 100-year geomagnetic solar storms. For E3 this could include adding either permanen t or switchable resistance to ground in the neutral of large transformers. This protec tion would then be available upon notice of the onset of a solar storm or sufficient thre at of EMP attack. Thus it provides a simple expedient that does not compromise performance unde r normal operation. Due to the interconnected nature of the grid and to the need for that connectivity to enable recovery, the likelihood of a blackout lasting years over large portions of the affected region is substantial with damage to thes e high-value components. The islanding of the system through nonsynchronous connections may help reduce the E2 and E3 impacts by shortening the long line coupling in some instances.  Assure sufficient numbers of ade quately trained recovery personnel —Expand levels of manpower and training as they are otherwise limited to only that needed for efficient normal power operation that is highly and increasingly computer aided. Industry and government must work together to enhance reco very capability.  Simulate, train, exercise, and test the recovery plan — Develop two or three centers for the purpose of simulating EMP and other majo r system threatenin g attacks. Develop procedures for addressing the impact of su ch attacks to identify weaknesses, provide training for personnel and develop EMP respons e training procedur es and coordination of all activities and appropr iate agencies and industry. While developing response plans, training and coordination are the pr imary purpose, identifying vulnerabilities through “red team” exercises is also impor tant for identifying, pr ioritizing, and recti-"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 60 fying weaknesses. The centers would each fo cus on one of the three main integrated electrical networks — Easter n Grid, Western Grid, and Te xas. These centers may be able to effectively utilize facilities such as the TVA bunker and the BPA control center in order to conserve resour ces and achieve rapid results . DOE facilities and other no longer utilized facili ties should also be examined. De velop simulators to train and develop procedures similar to the airline industry. Exercising bl ack start will require indemnification of power providers.  Develop and deploy system test standards and equipment — Test and evaluate the multitude of system components to ensure th at system vulnerability to EMP is identi- fied and mitigation and protection efforts are effective. Device-level standards and test equipment exist for normal power line distur bances (EMC standard s), but protection at the system level is the more important goa l. System-level improvements such as iso- lators, line protection, and grounding improve ments will be the most practical and least expensive in most cases rather than replacement of individual component devices.  Establish installation standards — More robust installation sta ndards must be identified and implemented as appropriate — such as short shielded cables, circumferential grounding, arrestors on leads, surge protectors, and simila r activities. These should include more robust system standards — such as proximity to protected device, no commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) computers in mission critical roles and similar mat- ters. In some instances, thes e will qualify as add-ons and replacements during the early period initiatives. The Government should complete the testing and evaluation work that the Commission initiated to set hardening standards for electric power protective systems. Government should provide fiscal assistance to industry in implementing the needed hardening solutions. Cost and Funding of Selected Initiatives It must be noted that the very wide variet y of components; installation techniques; local system designs; age of components, subsystems , and controls located within buildings or exposed; and so forth all dras tically affect the type and expense for implementing the recommended initiatives. Inte rnal DHS and other governmental costs are assumed to be absorbed. A significant portion of the labor to a ffect the modifications is already in place. Often the modification will be part of a pr ogram for repair, replacement and moderniza- tion that is continuing regardless of the EM P mitigation program. The addition of non- synchronous connection capability once defined is a contract function coupled with at- site staffing and control system interfaces. All of this effort f actors into the cost estimates and results in fairly wide ranges in most inst ances. Only the costs for some of the larger or more system-specific initiatives are estimated here (in 2007 dollars).  There are several thousand major transfor mers and other high-value components on the transmission grid. Protective relays a nd sensors for these components are more than that number but less than twice. A continual program of replacement and upgrade with EMP-hardened components will substa ntially reduce the cost attributable uniquely to EMP. Labor for installation is al ready a part of the industry work force. The estimated cost for add-on and EMP-hardened replacement units and EMP protec- tion schemes is in the range of $250 million to $500 million.  Approximately 5,000 generating plants of si gnificance will need some form of added protection against EMP, particularly for their control systems. In some instances the"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 2. Electric Power 61 fix is quite inexpensive and in others it wi ll require major replacements. The estimated cost is in the range of $100 million to $250 million.  The addition of nonsynchronous interfaces to create subregion islands is not known with reasonable certainty, but it might be in the order of $100 million to $150 million per island. The pace of creating islands and their priority will be established by DHS in consultation with NERC and FERC. Moving to at least six or more fairly rapidly is a fair assumption. There will be annual ope rating costs of around $5 million per island.  The simulation and training centers are assu med at three — one for each interconnect — for a cost in the range of $100 milli on to $250 million plus annual operating costs of around $25 million per year.  Protection of controls for emergency power supplies should not be too expensive since hard-wired manual start and run capability should be in place for many, which is ade- quate. Furthermore, the test, adjust, and verification will be carried out by the entity that owns the emergency power supply as part of normal operati ng procedures. Retro- fit of protective devices such as filters might be accomplis hed at a cost of less than $30,000 per generator for newer generators with vulnerable electronic controls. Hard- ening the connection to the rest of the fac ility power system requires a protected inter- nal distribution system from the backup generator.  Switchable ground resistors for hi gh-value transformers are estimated to cost in the range of $75 million to $150 million.  The addition of new black start generation wi th system integration and protected con- trols is estimated to cost around $12 m illion per installation. Probably no more than 150 such installations will need to be ad ded throughout the United States and Cana- dian provinces. Adding dual fuel capability to natural gas-fired generation is done for the economic purpose of the owner, yet it has the same value as the addition of black start generation. The addition of fuel storage for the existing black start units is rela- tively small, about $1 million each.  The addition of emergency generation at the multitude of sites including fuel and transportation sites is probably around $2 million to $5 million each.  The cost for monitoring, on a continuous basis, the state of the elec tric infrastructure, its topology, and key elements plus for a ssessing the actual EMP vulnerability, valida- tion of mitigation and protection, maintenance, and surveillance data for the system at large cannot be estimated since it falls under many existing government-funded activi- ties, but in any event, it is not considered significant.  Research and development ac tivities are a level-of-effort funding that needs to be decided by DHS. Redirection of existing funding is also likely to occur.  Funding for the initiatives above is to be divided between industry and government. Government is responsible for those activities that relate di rectly and uniquely to the purpose of assuring co ntinuation of the necessary functi oning of U.S. society in the face of an EMP attack or other broadly targeted physical or information systems attack. Industry is responsible for all othe r activities including reliability, efficiency and commercial interests. Industry is also the best source for advice on cost effective implementation of the initiatives."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 3.

T T e e l l e e c c o o m m m m u u n n i i c c a a t t i i o o n n s s Introduction Telecommunications provides the connectivity that links the elements of our society together. It is a vital capability that plays an integral role in the normal day-to-day routine of the civilian, business, and gove rnment sectors of society. It is a critical enabler for the functioning of our national financ ial infrastructure, as transactions representing trillions of dollars flow daily via teleco mmunications. It enables agenci es of local, state, and fed- eral government to discharge their duties. People can communica te on the go, almost anytime and virtually anywhere because of telecommunicati ons, as exemplified by more than 100 million cellular subscr ibers in the United States (U.S.). Telecommunications provides a vital pathway between emergency re sponse personnel in crisis situations. It has transformed, via the Internet and advan ces in technology, the way business and soci- ety in general operate. Downloading music and video content using the Internet instead of in-store purchases, using cell phones to interac tively gather travel directions instead of using paper maps, and using remote sensors and video streams to send security informa- tion over a communications networ k to a central site for appr opriate dispatch instead of using on-site security guards are examples of these changes. Telecommunications can be thought of as:  The mix of equipment used to initiate and receive voice, data, and video messages (e.g., cell phones and personal computers).  The associated media (e.g., fiber optics an d copper) and equipment (e.g., multiplexers) that transport those messages.  The equipment that routes the messages be tween destinations (e.g., Internet Protocol [IP]-based routers).  The basic and enhanced services offered by communications carriers such as AT&T, Verizon Wireless, and Comcast.  The supporting monitoring and management syst ems that identify, mitigate, and repair problems that can impact performance of services.  The supporting administrative systems for functions such as billing. This chapter discusses civilian telecommuni cations. Among the main trends to consider in evaluating the impact of EMP on these telecommunications netw orks in the next 15 years are:  The dramatic growth in the number of wire less networks and in the use of wireless services.  Improvements in the technology and reliability associated with optical networks lever- aging heavy fiber deployment (fiber is generally viewed positively in terms of EMP survivability).  Shrinking work forces used in managing ne tworks and an associated increase in dependence on automation and software “dia gnostic smarts” to support maintenance, problem isolation and recovery, and ot her performance impacting functions.  An architectural evolution toward a conve rged network in which voice, data, and video traffic are carried over the same network. When fully implemented, this evolution to a converged network will represent a major change-out of the equipment that existed in the 1990s, and that still exists, in the U.S."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 3. Telecommunications 63 telecommunications network. Thus, it represen ts an opportunity for EMP hardening con- siderations to be included as the transition occurs. Telecommunications service providers have proclaimed that carrying voice, data, and video together over converged networks is an underpinning of their strategic directions. Service providers point to the fact that traffic residing on embedded, older technology will be transitioned to this new converged network within financial and regulatory con- straints. 1 While this converged network evolutio n has begun, it is expected to continue for an additional decade or more. The reason for a lengthy tran sition can be better understood by reviewing some histori- cal factors related to the U.S. telecommunicatio ns network. Several f actors led to traffic being carried by separate networ ks, including differences in th e characteristics of voice, data, and video traffic; the relative dominan ce in the amount of voice traffic over data and video; and the technolo gical state of the carri er network equipment. With respect to traffic characteristics:  Voice communications generally are characteri zed by real-time interactions with typi- cal durations of a few minutes.  Data communications tend to occur in bursts and may consume large amounts of band- width during these bursts. Data communicatio ns users often access networks for long holding times that may range into hours.  Video traffic typically is characterized by high-bandwidth, long-duration, one-way transmission such as distributing cable TV content to viewers with lower-bandwidth traffic sent from the subscriber to the se rvice provider, for ex ample, to signal the selection of a specific on-demand program. With respect to traffic mixes:  As the 1990s progressed, the growth of data traffic exploded, fueled in large part by Internet usage. Data communi cations growth is continui ng at a rapid pace, while growth in voice has remained relatively flat. Some estimates have data traffic already exceeding voice traffic beginning around the year 2000.  The growth in data communications traffic ha s made it more fiscally attractive to find technological solutions that avoid the expe nse of maintaining separate voice and data networks. With respect to technology evolution:  Voice communications over the past decade have been handled primarily by carrier equipment called digital circuit switches. Th e switches are engineered based on statis- tical usage of the network that assumes not all of the individual users, traditionally in the thousands, served by those individual sw itches will try to gain access simultane- ously. These switches, of whic h several thousand are deploy ed, were not designed to effectively handle the characteristic s of data and video traffic.  Router technology has evolved rapidly. Advances in protoc ols that support assigning quality of service (QoS) requirements for diffe rent traffic mixes and greater processing speed and capacity have provided solutions for handling voice, data , and video using a common set of equipment.   1 Wegleitner, Mark, Verizon, Senior Vice Presiden t, Broadband Packet Evolution, Technology, 2005."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 3. Telecommunications 64  Service providers implement new technologies slowly. This is prudent given the com- plexity of the networks in question and a de sire to prove-in tec hnologies and fine-tune network management procedures prior to wide-scale deployment. Telecommunications Support During Emergencies There is a recognition at the highest levels of government and industry that telecommu- nications plays a critical role, not only in the normal day-to-d ay operations of society, but also in reconstituting societal functions and mitigating human, financial, and physical infrastructure losses during man-made and natu ral disasters. This has led to government and industry partnering to codify processes, organizational structures, and services to address these disasters. Among these codi fications are the Na tional Communications System (NCS) and a set of services known as National Security and Emergency Prepar- edness (NS/EP) services. The NCS was establishe d by Executive Order 12472, Assignment of National Security and Emergency Preparedness Telecommunications Functions . 2 These functions include administering the National Coordinating Ce nter for Telecommunications (NCC) to facilitate the initiation, coor dination, restoration, and r econstitution of NS/EP telecom- munications services or fac ilities under all crises and em ergencies; developing and ensuring the implementation of plans and progr ams that support the viability of telecom- munications infrastructure hardness, re dundancy, mobility, connectivity, and security; and serving as the focal point for joint i ndustry-government and interagency NS/EP tele- communications planning and partnerships. With respect to the NS/EP telecommunications services, a set of evolving capabilities exist for:  Prioritizing telephone calls th rough the wireline and wireless networks during time intervals when call volumes are excessive and facilities may be degraded.  Giving priority to restoring emergency and e ssential services that may be damaged or degraded.  Rapidly getting new telecommunicati ons connections into operation.  Keeping carriers communicating with govern ment and one another on an on-going basis during crises events. NS/EP-related definitions are noted below. NS/EP Definitions NS/EP Telecommunications Services— Telecommunications services that are used to maintain a state of readiness or to respond to and manage any event or cr isis (local, national, or international) that causes or could cause injury or harm to the population, damage to or loss of property, or de grades or loss of property, or degrades or threatens the NS/EP posture of the United States. (Telecommunications Service Priority [TSP] System for National Security Emergency Preparedness: Servic e User Manual, NCS Manual 3-1- 1, Appendix A, July 9, 1990) NS/EP Requirements— Features that maintain a state of readiness or respond to and manage an event or crisis (local, national, or international), which causes or could cause inju ry or harm to the population, damage to or loss of prop- erty, or degrade or threaten the NS/EP posture of the United States. (Federal Standard 1037C) Emergency NS/EP and Essential NS/EP— Emergency NS/EP telecommunication serv ices are those new services that are ‘‘so critical as to be required to be provisioned at the earliest possible time without regard to the costs of obtain- ing them.’’ An example of Emergency NS /EP service is federal government acti vity in response to a Presidential declared disaster or emergency. Telecommunications services are designated as essential where a disruption of ‘‘a few minutes to one day” could seriously affect the continued operations that support the NS/EP function.

Telecommunications 65 These NCS and NS/EP services are capabilities that woul d be drawn upon in an EMP event, and they will evolve as the U.S. te lecommunications network evolves. This com- mitment to evolution has been reinforced, for example, by testimony from Frank Libutti (Undersecretary, Information Analysis and In frastructure Protecti on, Department of Homeland Security) before the United States Senate Committee on Appropriations in 2004: The NCS is continuing a diverse set of mature and evolving programs designed to ensure priority use of telecommunications services by NS/EP users during times of na tional crisis. The more mature services—including the Government Emergency Telecomm unications Service (GETS) and the Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP)—were instrumental in the response to the September 11 attack s. FY 2005 funding enhances these programs and supports added developmen t of the Wireless Priority Ser- vice (WPS) program and upgrades to the Special Routing Arrangement Service (SRAS). Specifically, prio rity service programs include: (1) GETS, which offers nationwide priority voice and low-speed data service during an emergency or crisis situ ation; (2) WPS, which provides a nationwide priority cellular service to key NS/EP users, including indi- viduals from Federal, st ate and local governments and the private sector; (3) TSP, which provides the administ rative and operational framework for priority provisioning and restoration of critical NS/EP telecommunications services. In place since the mid-1980s , more than 50,000 circuits are pro- tected today under TSP, including circu its associated with critical infra- structures such as electric power, telecommunications, and financial ser- vices.; (4) SRAS, which is a variant of GETS to support the Continuity of Government (COG) program including th e reengineering of SRAS in the AT&T network and development of SRAS capabilities in the MCI and Sprint networks, and; (5) the Aler ting and Coordination Network (ACN) which is an NCS program that provides dedicated communications between selected critical government and telecommunications industry operations centers. 3 EMP Impact on Telecommunications To aid in understanding the impact of EMP on telecommunications, figure 3-1 pro- vides a simplified diagram of a telecommunications network. Service subscribers communicate through a lo cal node. For example, a cellular sub- scriber communicates through a cell tower cont rolled by a cellular ba se station. If com- munication is with a party located on anot her local node, the communications traffic may be routed through the backbone to the distan t local node for delivery to the other party. The backbone connects to thousa nds of local nodes and in doi ng so serves a transport and routing function to move voice, data, or vi deo traffic between or among the communica- tors. It consists of a mix of equipment that provides high-speed c onnectivity between the local nodes. In an actual netw ork if there is sufficient tr affic between two local nodes, they may be directly connected by tr ansmission media such as fiber links. Figure 3-1 shows some network equipment, such as a digital switch and a network router. The con- trol network collects information statistics from the equipment in the local nodes and   3 http://www.globalsecurity.org/secur ity/library/congress/2004_h/040302-libutti.htm ."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 3. Telecommunications 66 Figure 3-1. Generic Telecommunications Network Architecture backbone that help manage the network’s pe rformance. The backbone has been the main focus of industry in deploying components of th e converged network to date, and it is the furthest along with respect to the converged network vision. A set of first-order assumptions drove the analytical assessment of EMP impacts on telecommunications:  In a crisis, voice services will be viewed as critical, with the percent of call attempts completed as a key metric.  The backbone, as depicted in figure 3-1 , is where the greatest influx of new equipment has been deployed. This is newer-vintage, expensive, high-end routing and transport equipment connected by fiber optics. An assumption is that the equipment will be highly survivable up to high E1 EMP levels and perhaps will experience only transient effects at those levels, but this needs to be verified with further testing.  The local nodes will be replaced with equipment supporting th e converged network vision, but this change-out will continue beyond the tim e frame examined in this Commission study. Commission-sponsored test ing provided insights into the perform- ance of the new equipment that is being incorporated into the converged network. Among the current local node equipment are digital circuit switc hes and other equip- ment that have been tested and analyzed as part of a prior assessment of E1 EMP on telecommunications conduc ted in the early 1990s. 4 In this study, circuit switch   4 For example, Network Level EMP Effects Evaluation of the Primary PSN Toll-Level Networks, Office of the Manager: NCS, January 1994."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 3. Telecommunications 67 manufacturers noted they would be incor porating equipment changes to address a majority of the items shown to be susceptible to E1 EMP in the products tested, and the Commission assessments assume this to be the case. Keeping these factors in mi nd, the Commission focused its analytical e fforts on cus- tomer premises equipment (CPE), the subse quent impact on demand levels at the local nodes and local node equipment, and the subsequent ability to complete calls assuming a robust backbone. On the demand side, call origin ation electronic assets have the potential for EMP dis- ruption or damage. A key issue is whether EMP will impact the operation of telephones, cell phones, and computer systems (like those shown in figure 3-1 ) and, as such, reduce the demand placed on assets in the local and backbone elements that move information between information senders and receivers. The major elements of the civilian teleco mmunication network are electronic systems with circuit boards, integrated circuit chips, and cable connections such as routers that switch and transport information between us ers of the network (e .g., transport phone calls). Like the equipment that generates de mand on the network, these electronics have an inherent vulnerability to EMP threats. The majority of these critical switching and transport assets that are part of the local and backbone nodes in figure 3-1 are housed in Central Offices (COs). Typically COs ar e windowless concrete buildings. Sometimes equipment used to provide service to end users is housed in Controlled Environmental Vaults (CEV). These are smaller structures th at provide environmental control similar to that of a CO. Wireless base stations supporting cellular communications are housed in structures similar to CEVs. Finally, some e quipment such as that used to provide high- speed Internet service may be installed in small cabinets and enclosures without envi- ronmental controls. Regardless of the installation location, teleco mmunications equipment and the facilities that contain them follow strict rules and requi rements to protect against natural or unin- tentional electromagnetic disturbances, such as lightning, electroma gnetic interference, electrostatic discharge, and power influences on telecom cables. Typical protection tech- niques include grounding, bonding, shielding, a nd the use of surge protective devices. However, an EMP attack exhibits unique char acteristics, such as rapid rise-time tran- sients, and the existing protection measures we re not specifically in tended for or tested against EMP. Given these network characteristics, some factors that contribute to mitigating EMP effects on telecommunications are:  Industrywide groups that system atically share best practic es and lessons learned to improve network reliability, such as the Network Reliability and Interoperability Council (NRIC).  Availability of NS/EP tel ecommunications capabilities.  Volume, geographic diversity, and redunda nt deployment of telecommunications equipment assets, coupled with wireline, wi reless, satellite, and radio as alternative means for communications.  Deployment of fiber-optic technology with in telecommunications carrier networks.  Use of standard bonding and grounding prac tices for telecommuni cations equipment deployed in carrier networks."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 3. Telecommunications 68  Historical performance of terre strial carrier networks in el ectromagnetic events such as lightning and geomagnetic storms. The Commission sponsored testing and analytical efforts that led to the conclusion that an EMP attack would disrupt or damage a functionally significant fraction of the elec- tronic circuits in the Nation’s civilian telecommunications systems in the geographic region exposed to EMP. Cellular networks ar e seen as being less robust to EMP than landline networks due to a combination of the higher susceptibility of cellular network equipment to damage and more limited backup power capacity at cell sites than at coun- terpart landline network equipment sites. The analysis suggested that damage to telephones, cell phones, and other communica- tions devices would not be sufficient to cu rtail higher than normal call volumes on the civilian telecommunications network after exposur e to either low or high E1 EMP levels. As such, the remaining operational network w ould be subjected to high levels of call attempts for some period of time after the at tack, leading to degraded telecommunications services. Key government and nongovernment personnel will need priority access to use public network resources to coordinate and s upport local, regional, and national recovery efforts. This will be especially problematic during the interval of severe network conges- tion. Services such as GETS will be crucially important during these periods of high call demand. The Commission’s expectation is that the impact of a low E1 EMP level exposure would be dominated by the inability to ha ndle the spike in call traffic on landline net- works, because the direct impacts on equipment are expected to be largely transient and short term in nature (minutes to hours) w ith minimal manual restor ation. For cellular net- works, the impact will be greater (minutes to days) due to the expe cted levels of manual recovery, more limited backup power at cell sites, and the large number of cellular base stations that serve as key controllers of communications between cell towers and cell phones. The results of limited testing on cellu lar base stations indicate EMP vulnerabili- ties that require further examination. As noted in the electric power section of the Commission report, the loss of portions of the power grid is likely, even for a relative ly low-level EMP attack. The longer-term per- formance of the public telecommunications network and associated NS/EP services will depend, therefore, on the use of backup power capabilities and the rapidity with which primary power can be restored. To offset a loss of electric pow er, telecommunication sites now use a mix of batteries, mobile gene rators, and fixed-location generators. Typi- cally, these have 4 to 72 hours of backup power available on-site and thus will depend on either the resumption of electrical utility pow er or fuel deliveries to function for longer periods of time. A short-term electric power grid outage (less than a few days) would not cause a significant loss of telecom services due to the existence of power backup systems and best practices supporti ng these critical systems. In the case of high amplitude E1 EMP level exposures, spikes in call traffic, coupled with a mix of transient impacts and dama ge requiring manual network equipment resto- ration, will result in degraded landline and ce llular communications on the order of days to weeks. As in the case of low E1 levels, longer-term impacts from power outages could extend the period and severity of the degradation. General results from the Commission’s EMP analysis received concurrence from the NCS as noted below."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 3. Telecommunications 69   Senate Testimony (March 2005) In March 2005 testimony before a U.S. Senate subco mmittee (Terrorism and the EMP Threat to Homeland Security, Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology, and Home land Security, March 8, 2005), the Acting Director of the NCS noted that “Just last year, the NCS also actively participated in the congressionally-chartered Commission to Assess the Threat from Hi gh Altitude Electr omagnetic Pulse (the 2004 EMP Commission) that examined and evaluated the state of the EMP threat at present and looking 15 years into the foreseeable future. The Commission’s Report, delivered last July, concludes that EMP presents a less significant direct threat to telecommunications than it does to the National Power grid but would nevertheless disrupt or damage a functiona lly significant fraction of the electronic circuits in the Nati on’s telecommunications syst ems in the region exposed to EMP (which could include most of the United States). The NCS concurs with this assessment.” Analysis Approach To estimate the impact of an EMP attack on the civilian teleco mmunications network, the following major tasks were performed:  Reviewed lessons learned with respect to telecommunications critical dependencies and susceptibilities from past studies of events, such as major disasters and Year 2000 (Y2K).  Visited telecommunications faci lities to get “ground truth” insights into possible areas of EMP susceptibility and for data such as equipment layouts to support illustrative testing of telecommunications equipment.  Reviewed past test data and performed illust rative testing of wireline and cellular com- munications devices such as cell phones and network e quipment such as network routers to determine EMP susceptibilities.  Developed models of telephone network re storation processes and network call processing associated with alternative EM P scenarios using subject matter expert judgment, illustrative test data, and augmentation of existing models to estimate deg- radation levels for networks. Network statistic s such as call completion levels used to estimate degradation were generated for us ers, assuming they were not using NS/EP services such as GETS.

For example, with respect to managing the power grid, reference material associated with Y2K preparations noted, “The princi pal strategy is to ope rate using a manual transfer of a minimum set of critical info rmation ... electric systems must provide suf- ficient redundancy to assure voice comm unications over a geographic area that addresses its critical facil ities and interfaces to nei ghboring systems and regional centers.” 5  Conditions that would lead to multi-day unavailability of power remain a principal concern of telecommunications providers. Extended power outag es will exacerbate attempts to repair damage and lead to fuel shortages that end up taking network capacity off-line. This concern was reinfo rced by Hurricane Katrina and by the August   5 http://www.y2k.gov/docs /infrastructure.htm."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 3. Telecommunications 70 2003 Northeast Power Outage. The latter was a key topic of the August 27, 2003, NRIC meeting.  A high level of call attempts on both wireline and wireless networks will follow an EMP attack, thereby reducing the effectiv eness of voice communications for some time period. At least four times the normal call traffic will likely be experienced by these networks. In previous disasters, these high levels generally lasted for 4 to 8 hours and remained slightly elevated for the firs t 12 to 24 hours after the event. The spike in call volumes results in callers experiencing problems in successful call completion. Additionally, callers may experi ence conditions such as dela yed dial tones or “all cir- cuits busy” announcements. As an example, the high blocking levels experienced by callers on cellular networks on Septembe r 11, 2001, in Washington, D.C., and New York City are shown in figure 3-2 as call attempts rose to levels as high as 12 times normal. 6 4% 92% 75% 56% 43% 0% 200% 400% 600% 800% 1000% 1200% 1400% Normal NE Region WDC NYC Day NYC 11am Traffic Demand 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Blocked Call Rate Traffic Demand Blocked Call Rate 92% 75% 56% 43% 0% 200% 400% 600% 800% 1000% 1200% 1400% Normal NE Region WDC NYC Day NYC 11am Traffic Demand 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Blocked Call Rate Traffic Demand Blocked Call Rate Figure 3-2. September 11, 2001, Bloc ked Call Rate—Cellular Networks  As previously noted, concerns over the ability of key personnel to get calls through the public telecommunications network in a disast er was one of the catalysts for services development that occurred under the lead ership of the NCS. GETS and WPS are services intended for use in emergency conditions to impr ove the probability of key personnel completing calls even when wi reline and wireless network are under extremely heavy call loads. These services wi ll be leveraged during an EMP event, but their benefits for subscribers are mitigated when local equipment requires manual recovery to be functional. Ba sed on test results, this manual recovery requirement for cellular base stations is of particular concern.  Maintenance and control functions will be cri tical to restoration and recovery efforts, as they are used by telecommunications car riers to alleviate the overload conditions and identify areas of damage within the ne twork to hasten recove ry efforts. For the general populace without access to NS/EP servi ces, if massive call attempts tie up network resources there would be minimal circ uits available to di al out and potentially reduced capability to reach 9-1-1 services. To help alleviate this, personnel in a Net- work Management Center (see figure 3-3 ) could issue a command to the carrier net- work for “call gapping” through a few qui ck keystrokes on a personal computer. Through this command, some percentage of calls would be stopped at the originating   6 Aduskevicz, P., J. Condello, Capt. K.

Testing con- ducted as part of the previously referen ced NCS-sponsored assessment indicated that some physical damage to circuit switch components linking to these network man- agement facilities would occur, even at very low transient levels. This damage would reduce the ability of recovery efforts to bring systems up to full capacity and affect the ability to remotely implement procedures to address EMP-induced network problems.

Sites containing wire line network switching and tr ansport equipment, cellular network switching and transport equipment, and Network Management Center equipment were visited. Features such as cable lengths and bonding and gr ounding practices and issues such as policies for stockpiling spares were explored during th ese visits. In addi- tion, discussions were held with personnel involved in telecommunications equipment installation activities, technical requiremen ts development for electromagnetic effects protection, and network monitori ng and control activities to ve t assumptions made in the equipment testing and modeling activities. Figure 3-4 shows cellular network base sta- tion equipment photographed dur ing one of the visits. Figure 3-5 is a photo of router equipment used to collect performance information from carrier equipment and transmit it to a Network Management Cent er, such as the one in figure 3-3 . Based on the collected data, a process for ne twork restoration was developed consider- ing the wide mix of assets that could be aff ected in an EMP event. The restoration proc- ess was reviewed with experts who had been involved in large restoration efforts, including personnel charged w ith developing software sy stems to expedite network recovery. These reviews helped augment the re storation process model. This process was used in developing recovery timelines gene rated in the modeling and simulation activity. Figure 3-3.

Consistent with this, testi ng activities focused on communications devices and switching and routing equipment expected to play a critical role in supporting future voice communications and on computing equipm ent supporting the co llection of data used for network traffic management. E1 was considered as the primary source of EMP effects on carrier equipment under the assumption that long transport lines within carrier telecommunications networks have moved to fi ber instead of copper. We also recognized the growing use of fiber within close proxim ity to home and business establishments. In accordance with these assumptions, the commun ications carrier network equipment test- ing focused on assets that would be c onsidered part of the local nodes in figure 3-1 . Prior test data on digital switches, router s, computers, and re lated equipment were reviewed. For example, during the 1980s a nd early 1990s, the NCS sponsored testing on major telecommunications switc hes and transport equipment. The test effort conducted on behalf of the EMP Commission was designe d to complement the data available in previously discussed NCS technical reports a nd other data sources. The test data provided information on the behavior of particular piec es of equipment and was subsequently used to model the impact of an EMP attack on the telecommunications network infrastructure and the recovery process. In addition to network equipment, CPE such as basic tele- phones and cell phones were tested, as the le vel of traffic on the public telecommunica- tions networks would be affected by the CPE’s EMP survivability. Table 3-1 lists the telecommunications assets tested at multip le government and commercial facilities, including a rationale for why they were selected. A mixtur e of continuous wave immer- sion (CWI), pulse current injection (PCI), and free field illumination tests was used. Fig- ure 3-6 depicts testing that was conducted at a cellular base station at Idaho National Laboratory (INL). Free -field illumination testing was conducted on equipment covering each of the areas in table 3-1 (except for cellular networ k carrier switching equipment [see figure 3-6 ]). The equipment tested included a softswitch, cordless phones, cellular phones, computing servers, Ethe rnet switches, and routers. During the testing, in cases where impacts were observed, some were transient in nature, for example, auto-rebooting of softsw itch equipment, while some testing resulted in permanent equipment damage and required manual recovery via replacement of com- ponents (for example Ethernet card replacemen t) to address performance degradation.

The analysis leveraged the Commission-sponsored testing just desc ribed, as well as prior equipment testing results. Initially, a telecomm unications network performance modeling approach for gen- erating call completion levels given degrad ation assumptions in wireline and wireless networks was developed for the continental United States. The major assumption in this modeling was that the key area of degradation would be lo cal nodes in the carrier net- works (for both wireline and ce llular networks). As shown in figure 3-1 , local nodes are equipment such as the digital circuit switch es and cellular base st ation equipment that provide callers with entry into these wire line and cellular telecommunications networks. Impacts on local nodes could inhi bit local calls, as well as prohibit connections to the backbone network that provides for more geographically disper sed communications. Positive trends in the direction of EMP su rvivability for backbone communications are due to increased routing diversity coupled w ith heavy fiber deployment, suggesting that a local focus is reasonable in te rms of first-order effects. Following this logic, the modeling steps included: 1. Generate a case study using weapons detona tion scenarios that produce electromag- netic field levels modeled over selected ge ographic regions of th e United States and model the impact on network performance (e.g., call completion levels) given the degree of network upset expected to be caused initially by the EMP event. We included transient or self-co rrecting effects and effects th at require human action to correct. The model incorporated past test re sults from NCS studies and new testing of the equipment listed in table 3-1 , using assumptions about the types and configura- tions of equipment that would be deployed in affected areas. The starting point for equipment types was industry databases id entifying equipment deployed in telecom- munications networks. This was augmented with subject matter expert discussions. 2. Apply generic methods and procedures inco rporated in the network restoration proc- ess noted earlier to generate recovery tim es for network equipment.

Telecommunications 76 3. Use the recovery times to model placing e quipment back in service and iteratively estimate network performance levels over time using the network performance model. The following are illustrative re sults generated from among scen arios of interest identi- fied by the Commission. Figures 3-9 through 3-11 show originating call completion levels in the eastern United States for the average combined wireline and wireless calls after an EMP event. Time period categories in these figures include immediately follow- ing, 4 hours after, and 48 hours after the EMP event. The results displayed incorporate longer restoration times for cellular equipmen t, driven in part by levels of manual recovery. Figure 3-12 shows the recovery curve during the 10-day period following the attack. This is the estimated time period to regain pre-event performance, absent other infrastructure interdependency impacts such as long-term power outages. The shaded circles indicate EMP field- level isocontours generated by the weapon. For example, in figure 3-9 , the geographic area most negatively impacted has estimated call completion levels of roughly only 4 percent, while the area outside the range of the direct effects has a 73 percent call completion level estimate. The reason for the 73 percent leve l is that callers outside the directly affected areas are unable to make calls into the affected areas due to equipment disrup tions in those areas, coupled with network congesti on and high call-retry levels.

Telecommunications 78 gies, such as softswitches, are being introduced into the networ k. It is important to verify that this equipment will operate through an EMP attack under the stressful operating con- ditions that are anticipated in an emergency situation. Th e use of IP-related technology such as softswitches to support GETS and WPS services is at the in itial point of deploy- ment in local offices. Rigorous analysis is warranted prior to their major deployment to examine EMP survivability issues. During sensitivity analysis, in the process of examining alternative cellular base station damage levels, an area of concern was identi fied within the cellular network system. Spe- cifically, the area of concern was degrad ation of network perf ormance due to EMP effects on critical databases, including the Home Location Registers (HLRs). HLRs con- tain key user information associated with cel lular subscribers, such as account status and location. Within the wireless industry, the depl oyment approach to achieve HLR diversity (physical and geographic) is mixe d. HLRs were not tested for su sceptibility levels as part of the EMP Commission study, but using prox y numbers based on testing for circuit switching equipment, sensitivity studies show that it is possible to lose major calling areas in an EMP attack due to HLR degradatio n. In addition to EMP susceptibility test- ing, engineering polices and se lective EMP hardening of thes e elements are options that should be examined in the future. As noted in the Electric Power chapter, loss of portions of the power grid is likely, even for a relatively low-level EMP attack. Our analys is indicates that, in a relatively low-level EMP attack, the direct impact on public tel ecommunications networks is likely to be dominated by the inability to handle ensuing sp ikes in call traffic. In such cases, the direct effects on equipment are expected to be largely transient and short term in nature (minutes to hours) with minimal manual rest oration needed. However, should widespread loss of primary power occur, the survivabili ty of the telecommuni cations network and associated NS/EP and other se rvices will depend on the use of backup power capabilities and the rapidity with which primary power can be restored. Most public telecommunica- tions equipment has a mix of battery, mobile generator, and fixed generator support if primary electric power is lost. A short-term loss of the electric power supporting most telecommunications networks today would not cause a major loss of telecom services. This is due to the existen ce of power backup systems and best practices supporting these critical systems that could sustain teleco m services during short-term power outages. The situation becomes more se rious if the power outages ar e long term and widespread. In such cases, the likely loss of major teleco mmunications facilities would significantly reduce NS/EP services. A majority of reside ntial telephones today depend on power from local central offices, which would be lost once the backup power at those offices is depleted. Other residential telephones also re quire commercial power to function. Thus, citizen ability to access 9-1-1 call centers w ould be a major concern in an extended power outage situation. Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 damaged cel l phone towers and radio antennas. The prolonged blackout resulting from Katrina exha usted the fuel supplies of backup genera- tors servicing emergency communications . Consequently, emergency communications for police, emergency services, and rescue efforts failed. Significantly, these same nodes so critical to emergency communications —cell phone towers and radio antennas—are vulnerable to EMP attack. A protracted blac kout resulting from an EMP attack would also exhaust fuel supplies for emergency ge nerators, just as occurred during Hurricane Katrina."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 3. Telecommunications 79 Public telecommunications networks can su ccessfully handle a local power outage or short-term outage, such as the August 14, 2003, Northeast blackout. However, a major concern exists with outage durations that range in weeks or m onths. The widespread collapse of the electric grid due to an EMP event would lead to cascading effects on interdependent infrastructures, as happened during the Katrina blackout. This may well lead to a long-term loss of telecommunicati ons in extended geographic areas outside the power loss. This loss would cascade to any critical applications that depend on telecommunications. As such, te lecommunications resilience would greatly benefit from steps to increase power grid and backup power reliability and availability time frames. Telecommunications network managers have indicated that a key asset in any outage event is the ability to monito r the health of the network in real time to enable rapid response to identified problems. Given the in creased level of automation in telecommuni- cations networks coupled with reduction in pe rsonnel, it is critical that the telecommuni- cations operations and control functions rema in operational in an EMP event. In recov- ering from an EMP attack, telecommunications carriers will depend on hardware and software systems that help isolate problem areas and implement commands to initiate remediation efforts. Computer servers, pers onal computers, routers, and related equip- ment are key components that are housed in Network Management Centers. Carriers typically deploy the equipment in geographica lly diverse centers in which one center can back up the others. Effects to those centers are moderated in cases in which the centers are separated by distances larger than the EMP footprint. Recommendations Based on the analytical effo rts performed by this Commission, the following steps are recommended to improve telecommunications performance during and after an EMP event:  Successfully evolve critical NS/EP telecommunications se rvices to incorporate the new technologies being embedded in to telecommunications networks.  Improve the ability of telecommunications services to function for extended periods without the availability of primary power.  Adequately address infrastructure interdep endency impacts in contingency planning.  Identify critical applications that must survive an EMP event and address any short- falls in telecommunications services that support these applications. These recommendations are discussed in mo re detail in the next few sections. Preventing Widespread Outages from New Technology EMP is just one of the potential sources that would lead to stressing telecommunica- tions networks. Understanding NS/EP service pe rformance with respect to IP technology has benefits beyond application to EMP. This issue is in line with a U.S. government interagency Convergence Working Group (CWG) finding 7 that noted, “The FCC should task NRIC to assess the adequacy of intero perability testing betw een circuit and packet switch networks ... minimize the risk of featur e interactions and the introduction of addi- tional vulnerabilities affecting reliability, avai lability, and security of telecommunication services supporting NS/EP users.”   7 Convergence Working Group’s final report, Impact of Network Convergence on NS/EP Telecommunications: Findings and Recommenda tions, February 2002."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 3. Telecommunications 80 High-profile network failures have occurred as new technol ogies were introduced into networks. Inadequate testing prior to widespread deploymen t has been highlighted as a major problem in lessons learned from past outages related to new technology introduc- tion. 8 These offer an incentive for the testing of new technology supporting NS/EP ser- vices prior to widespread deployment of th e technologies. The use of packet switching technology to support voice serv ices such as GETS and WPS is at the ini tial point of deployment. Rigorous testing is warranted prior to major deployment. With early identifi- cation, specific system EMP vulnerabilities can be addre ssed prior to widespread deployment. The following are specific steps to a ddress technology introduction concerns:  NCS 9 represents a logical organization to address these areas given its mission associated with the development and ma intenance of NS/EP services. NCS should partner with other appropriate organizati ons to determine the effects of EMP on different types of telecommunications e quipment, facilities , and operations by: — The testing and analysis of new technol ogies introduced into telecommunications networks that will support NS/EP services prior to wide spread introduc tion into the public network. IP-related equipment shoul d be a major near-term focus of this testing and analysis. This analysis should include examining the use of standards in terms of prevention and mitigation benefits. — Capturing the lessons learned from future outages associated with the expected growth of voice communications by nontraditional carriers and the tremendous growth in wireless communications. It is important that such lessons learned be captured in a systematic and fiscally prudent manner. Historically, data captured by the Fede ral Communications Commission (FCC) on major outages has been extremely valuable in identifying and correc ting problems as they are exhibited in deployed syst ems. Again, this is consiste nt with the EMP Commission’s philosophy of preventing disastrous conse quences from “cheap shot” attacks. Reducing the Effects of Power Ou tages on the Telecommunications Infrastructure In a power outage, telecomm unications carriers typically depend on battery supplies that last from 4 to 8 hours and in some cases fixed and mobile generators that may have up to 72 hours of operating fuel. A key concer n is the potential that major telecommuni- cations facilities may not have primary power in the event of a long-term power outage of several weeks over a wide geographic area. Among the major concerns in such events are:  The potential that major telecommunications facilities will not have prioritized access to fuel supplies on a long-term basis in the event of a long-term, wide-scale power outage.  Facilities running on backup gene rators on a long-term basi s will eventually require maintenance.   8 AT&T (Albert Lewis) correspondence with FCC, May 13, 1998; MCI (Bradley Stillman) correspondence with FCC, December 8, 1999. 9 47 CFR Part 215 designated the Executiv e Agent, NCS, as the focal point within the Federal Government for all EMP technical data and studies concerning telecommunications."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 3. Telecommunications 81 These concerns proved prescient when Hu rricane Katrina struck in August 2005. Katrina caused a prolonged blackout that re sulted in telecommunications failures precisely because of the above concerns re garding fuel supplies and maintenance for emergency generators. After the August 2003 Northeast blackout, recommendations were put forward by the NRIC to help address this power dependency is sue. As part of lessons learned discussed in an August 27, 2003, NRIC pr esentation on the impact of the 2003 Northeast blackout, telecom-specific references were made to re-evaluate the Telecommunications Electric Service Priority (TESP) program: “Power management and restor al practices at the tactical level are under review by carriers—ma y need modifications to the TESP program to mitigate additional risks,” and “Developm ent of TESP program for cellular networks to address priority restoration of critical cellular communications facilities is needed.” 10 TESP promotes (on a voluntary basis) the inclusion of critical telecommunications facilities in electric service providers’ priority restoration plans. 11 Lessons learned from Katrina and the NRIC evaluation of the 2003 Northeast blackout form the underpinning for the following EMP Commission recommendations:  Improve the ability of telecommunications to withstand the sustained loss of utility- supplied electric power: — Task the NCS and the North American Elect ric Reliability Cor poration (NERC), or its successor, with providi ng, at a minimum, biannual status reports on the need for/adequacy of priority re storation of electric power by power utilities to selected telecommunications sites. — Task the Department of Energy (DOE) with exploring the adequacy of financial incentives to spur analysis of alternativ e powering sources that offer cost-effective and viable alternatives fo r telecom asset powering. For example, carriers are exploring new technologies such as fuel cells to support the powering of offices. Adequately Addressing Interdependency Impacts in Contingency Planning The potential impact of othe r interdependency effects, with a priority on NS/EP ser- vices, must be considered in any analysis of recovery planning. For example, the assumption of key personnel access to transporta tion to operations center sites or remote access to equipment should be addressed in contingency planning. With this in mind, the NCS would be a logical organiza tion to address this area for critical national infrastruc- tures. Specifically, the Commission recommends the following:  Expand the role of the NCS within the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 215 (Federal Focal Point for EMP Information) to address infrastructure interdependencies related to NS/EP telecommunications services. Supporting this recommendation is the need to exercise the National Response Framework to determine how well the plan addresses simultaneous degradation of mul- tiple infrastructures. Industry personnel have suggested to the EMP Commission that a tabletop exercise considering th is type of scenario would be extremely useful. Exercise results should be factored into the developmen t of an EMP scenario to be included on the DHS list of National Planning Scenarios. Such an exercise would be invaluable in   10 Aduskevicz, P., J. Condello, Capt. K.

B B a a n n k k i i n n g g a a n n d d F F i i n n a a n n c c e e Introduction The financial services industry comprises a network of organizations and attendant systems that process instrument s of monetary value in the form of deposits, funds trans- fers, savings, loans, and other financial transa ctions. Virtually all ec onomic activity in the United States (U.S.) and other developed countries depends on the functioning of the financial services industry. Nati onal wealth is the su m of all economic value, as reflected in part in existing capital and financial transa ctions. Most simply, th e financial services industry is the medium and record keeper fo r financial transacti ons and repository of national, organizational, and individual wealth. Today, most significant financial transacti ons are performed and recorded electroni- cally; however, the ability to carry out these transactions is highl y dependent on other elements of the national infrastructure. According to the President’s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NST AC), “The financial services industry has evolved to a point where it would be impossi ble to operate without the efficiencies of information technology and networks.” 1 The automation of the financial services indu stry has spurred the growth of wealth by increasing greatly the amount of business that can be conducted on a daily basis. For example, “in the early 1970s, the New York Stock Exchange [NYSE] closed every Wednesday to clear backlogs from an average daily trading volume of 11 million shares.” 2 Today, the Securities Industry Automati on Corporation (SIAC) has no interrup- tion in exchange operations and routinely ha ndles an average daily trading volume of more than 3 billion shares. 3 “SIAC is responsible for providing the highest quality, most reliable and cost-effective systems to support the current and future business needs of the New York Stock Exchange” 4 and other institutions. “SIAC’s Shared Data Center alone is linked to the securities industry by more than a thousa nd communications lines over which an average of 70 billion bytes of data is transmitted daily.” 5 SIAC’s Secure Financial Transaction Infrastructure, “improves the overall resilien ce of the financial indu stry’s data communi- cations connectivity...and offers firms relia ble access to... trading, clearing and settle- ment, market data distribution, and other services.” 6 The technological revolution has not been limite d to giant corporations.

The increasing dependence of the United States on an electronic economy, so bene- ficial to the management and cr eation of wealth, also increas es U.S. vulnerability to an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack. For example, the terrorist attacks of Se ptember 11, 2001, demonstrated the vulnerabili- ties arising from the significant interdependenc ies of the Nation’s critical infrastructures. The attacks disrupted all critical infrastructures in New York City, including power, transportation, and telecommunications. Conse quently, operations in key financial mar- kets were interrupted, increasing liquidity risks for the U.S. financial system. 9 An interagency paper jointly issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Reserve Board (FRB), a nd the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), specifies clearing and settlement syst ems as the most critical business operations at risk for financial markets. 10 Because financial markets are highly interdependent, a wide-scale disruption of core clearing and settlement proce sses would have an immediate systemic effect on critical financial markets. 11 Moreover, in December 2002, the FRB revised its policy and procedures for national security and emergency preparedness teleco mmunications programs administered by the National Communications System (NCS) to id entify those functions supporting the Fed- eral Reserve’s national security mission to maintain national liquidity. 12 The FRB expanded the scope of services that would seriously affect continued financial operations if a telecommunications di sruption of “a few minutes to one day” occurred. 13 These func- tions, which are listed below, “require same-d ay recovery and are cr itical to the opera- tions and liquidity of banks and th e stability of financial markets”: 14  Large-value interbank funds tr ansfer, securities transfer, or payment-related services  Automated clearing hou se (ACH) operators  Key clearing and settlement utilities  Treasury automated aucti on and processing system   7 United States, The President’s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee, Financial Services Risk Assessment Report (Washington, 1997), 47. 8 ATM & Debit News, September 10, 2003, ATM & Debit News Survey Data Offe rs Insight into Debit Card and Network Trends in Its 2004 EFT Data Book, press release, http://www.sourcemedia.com /pressreleases/20030910ATM.html . 9 MacAndrews, James J., and Simon M.

The electronic technolo- gies that are the foundation of the financial infrastructure are potentially vulnerable to EMP. These systems are also potentially vu lnerable to EMP indi rectly through other critical infrastructures, such as the el ectric power grid and telecommunications. The Financial Services Industry In a December 1997 study, Financial Services Risk Assessment Report , NSTAC described the financial services industry as comprising four sectors. This definition is reflected or shared in current U.S. government reports, regu lations, and legislation that treat the financial services indus try as having these components:  Banks and other depository institutions  Investment-related companies  Industry utilities  Third-party processors and other services. Banks and Other Depository Institutions. In 2004, U.S. banks held more than $9 tril- lion 16 of domestic financial assets, and invest ment companies and other private institu- tions held about $17 trilli on of the national wealth. 17 Banks and other depository institu- tions, including thrifts, credit unions, and savings and loan a ssociations, are vital to the functioning of the economy. These institutions hold and provide access to deposits, pro- vide loans, transfer funds, promote sa vings, and facilitate economic growth. Commercial banks are the repository of the most financial assets of any depository institution. Commercial banks di sseminate financial informati on, act as agents in buying and selling securities, serve as trustees for corporations or individuals, transfer funds, collect deposits, and provide credit. The top 10 commercial ba nks control nearly half of all assets held by banks. 18 Credit unions, savings and loan associations, and savings ba nks generally are referred to as “other depository institutions.” These in stitutions usually service households instead of businesses. Credit unions are the most fina ncially significant of these institutions. By the end of 2004, credit unions had more th an 85 million members and managed more than $668 billion in assets. 19 The single most important banking institu tion is the Federal Reserve System. Estab- lished by the U.S. Congress in 1913, the Federal Reserve System is the central bank of the United States. This system does not deal directly with the general public, but with other banks. It is, in essence, the Nation’s bank for commercial banks. The primary purpose of the Federal Reserve System is to maintain the stability, safety, and flexibility of the financial system and c ontain systemic risk that may arise in the   15 Ibid. 16 United States, Federal Reserve Board, Federal Reserve Bulletin Statistical Supplement (Washington: GPO, 2004), 15. 17 Investment Company Institute, 2005 Investment Company Factbook, 2005, http://www.ici.org/factbook . 18 Klee, Elizabeth C., and Fabio M.

Banking and Finance 86 financial markets. The Federal Reserve accomplishes this mission by establishing mone- tary policy, by servicing financial institut ions and other government agencies, and by regulating and supervising banks. As the central bank of the United States, the Federal Reserve System extends emer- gency credit to commercial banks and controls interest rates, fore ign exchange, and the money supply. The Federal Reserve also pe rforms check-clearing and processing and transfer of government securities and funds between financial institutions. Federal Reserve System banks are superv ised by a Board of Governors who are appointed by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate; however, the banks are owned by private member banks. For administ rative purposes, the United States is divided into 12 Federal Reserve Districts, each district served by a Federal Reserve Bank. The 12 Federal Reserve Banks are located in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Rich- mond, Atlanta, Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, Minneapolis, and San Francisco. Investment-Related Companies. Unlike commercial banks, underwriters, brokerages, and mutual funds are not depository institutions . Rather, these institutions provide a wide range of services to institutiona l and individual investors. Th ey act as intermediaries in pooling investments by a large group of customers and in market trades. Investment banks and underwriters finan ce investments by government and commercial enterprises through stocks and bonds. Investme nt banks also arrange mergers. Currently, the largest 50 firms hold 90 pe rcent of the market share. 20 Brokerages help investors by acting as agents or intermediaries with commodities and securities markets. Brokerages advise client s, perform research, a nd place trades. “The securities brokerage industry in the Unite d States includes fewer than 400 companies with combined annual revenue of over $100 billion. The top 50 co mpanies hold over 80 percent of the market share.” 21 Mutual funds pool money from many people a nd institutions and invest it in stocks, bonds, or other securities. A portfolio manager is employed by the mutual fund to achieve its financial objective, such as providing a re liable source of investment income or maxi- mizing long-term returns. The mutual fund market is dominated by 25 companies. The top five companies hold one-third of the ma rket. The mutual fund industry holds about $8.1 trillion dollars in assets. 22 Industry Utilities. Banks, including the Federal Reserv e System, and investment-related companies, such as investment banks, brokera ges, and mutual funds, all rely on industry utilities to transact business. Financial servi ce utilities are the institutions that provide a common means for transferring, clearing, and se ttling funds, securiti es, and other finan- cial instruments, as well as exchanging financial information. Financial industry utilities ha ve largely replaced paper tr ansactions with electronic means. Check and cash transactions are still the largest number of financial transactions in the national economy. However, paper trans actions are vastly surpassed in total value   20 \"Industry Overview: Investme nt Banking,\" Hovers, Inc., http://www.hoovers.com/investment-banking-/ --ID__209--/free-ind-fr-profile-basic.xhtml . 21 Ibid. 22 Investment Company Institute, 2005 Investment Company Factbook, 2005, 59, http://www.ici.org/fact book/pdf/05_fb_table01.pdf ."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 4. Banking and Finance 87 by electronic transactions through wire transf ers, interbank payment systems, ACHs, and clearing and settlement systems for securities and other investments. Modern financial services utilities have tr ansformed the national economy from a paper system into an electronic system. Examples of some key industry utilities include FED- NET, Fedwire, ACH, Clearing House Interb ank Payments System (CHIPS), the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecomm unications (SWIFT), the National Associa- tion of Securities Dealers’ Automated Q uotation System (NASDAQ), the NYSE, the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), and the Depository Trust and Clearing Cor- poration (DTCC). FEDNET is a communications system c onnecting all 12 Federal Reserve Banks nationwide and the financial services industr y generally. FEDNET transfers funds in real time among banks and other depository institutions, performs real-time sales and record keeping for the transfer of government securities, and serves as ACH. Fedwire is the primary nationa l network for the transfer of funds between banks; the system currently serves approximately 7,500 in stitutions. Fedwire’s book-entry securities transfer application a llows banks and other depository in stitutions to transfer U.S. gov- ernment securities. This network has enabled the Federal Reserve to largely replace paper U.S. government securities with electronic book entries. Transfers performed on Fedwire are irrevocable upon receipt and are settled i mmediately. The average value of a Fedwire funds transaction is about $3.9 million dollars. 23 In 2005, Fedwire processed an average daily volume of approximately 528,000 payments , with an average da ily value of about $2.1 trillion. 24 ACH was developed in the 1970s as an altern ative to the traditional paper-based system for clearing checks. ACH electronic transactions include direct depos its of payrolls, pen- sions, benefits, and dividends and direct bill payments. The Federal Reserve annually processes about 36.7 billion ACH paymen ts valued at $39.9 trillion dollars. 25 CHIPS is an electronic system for interba nk transfer and settlement. CHIPS is the pri- mary clearing system for foreign exchange . “It processes over 285,000 payments a day with a gross value of $1.4 trillion.” This incl udes 95 percent of all in ternational U.S. dol- lar payments. 26 The SWIFT provides stock exchanges, banks , brokers, and other institutions with a cost-effective, secure international pa yment message system. These messages are instructions between banks and other institut ions regarding payments and transfers, not payments themselves. SWIFT carries approximately 8 million messages daily. 27 The NASDAQ and the NYSE are the largest securities markets. NASDAQ is an elec- tronic communications network that consolidates the quotations of multiple dealers, dis- played in real time, and allows electroni c trading. The NYSE offers similar electronic   23 Federal Reserve Board, http: //www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsyste ms/coreprinciples/default.htm#fn12 . 24 Ibid. 25 United States, Federal Reserve System, Analysis of Noncash Payments Trends in the United States: 2000–2003 (Washington: 2004), 5. 26 SWIFT, 2005 Annual Report: Alternative Connectivi ty for CHIPS Reinforces Resilience, http://www.swift.com/index.cfm?item_id=59677 . 27 SWIFT, 2004 Annual Report: SWIFTnet Now the Benefits Really Begin, http://www.swift.com/index.cfm?item_id=56868 ."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 4.

NASDAQ executed 957.9 million trades valued at more than $3.7 trillion dol- lars in 2004, and the NYSE trad ed a slightly lesser amount. 28 The NYMEX trades on futures contracts such as unleaded gasoline, heating oil, crude oil, natural gas, and platinum. NYMEX typi cally conducts crude o il transactions involv- ing the total daily producti on of the entire world. The DTCC settles securities tr ades for participant banks an d is the largest securities depositary in the world. In 2004, the company completed fina ncial settlement for a quad- rillion dollars in securities transactions. DTCC keeps reco rds on securities and conducts transactions electronically. A nnually, DTCC particip ants deliver securities valued at about $4.5 trillion to DTCC to make electronic records of ownership. 29 Third-Party Processors and Other Services. Third-party processing companies are technology companies that provide electronic pro cessing services to financial institutions. Banks and other financial institutions can cut overhead by contracting with third parties to perform the mechanics of electronic tran sactions. Technology-re lated outsourcing is especially appealing because of dynamic ch anges in technology. The high cost and com- plexity of new technologies has driven many banks into partnerships with third-party specialists in the field of el ectronic finance. Services t ypically offered by third-party processors include data center management , network management, application develop- ment, check and statement processing, mutu al fund account processing, and electronic funds transfer. Vulnerability to EMP The financial infrastructure is highly depe ndent on electronic systems, which should be clear from the preceding discussion. Virtually all transactions involving banks and other financial institutions happen electronically. Virtually all record keeping of financial transactions are stored elect ronically. Just as paper money has replaced precious metals, so an electronic economy has replaced the pa per one. The financial infrastructure is a network of simple and complex electronic machinery, ranging from telephones to main- frame computers, from ATMs to vast data storage systems. The electronic technologies that are the f oundation of the financial infrastructure are potentially vulnerable to EMP. These systems also are potentially vulnerable to EMP indirectly through other critical infrastr uctures, such as the power grid and telecommunications. The financial services industry and knowledg eable experts on the security of that industry judge that the industr y is highly robust against a wide range of threats. The NSTAC, for example, notes that the leading financial institutions take a multilayered approach to building robustness and recoverability into their systems: Operational data centers are en gineered from the ground up with survivability in mind. Som e are hardened with thick con- crete walls and protected with extensive perimeter security measures equivalent to military command posts. Most have uninterruptible power supplies, generators, and on-site fuel   28 NASDAQ, NASDAQ Announces Market Year -end Statistics for 2004, http://ir.nasdaq.com/releas edetail.cfm?ReleaseID=177077 . 29 DTCC, 2004 Annual Report: What is a Quadrillion? 3, http://www.dtcc.com/downloa ds/annuals/2004/2004_report.pdf ."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 4. Banking and Finance 89 storage sufficient to allow the facility to run independently of the power grid ranging from a few hours to over a month. External telecommunications li nks are diversely homed, with multiple building access points and connections to more than one central office...wherever possible. Operational procedures within the data center are designed to minimize the risk of human errors causing interruptions, and most or all data files are copied and stored on disk or tape at off-site facilities. 30 NSTAC also observes that, “Numerous natura l and man-made disasters...have forced financial institutions to test and refine their disaster recovery capabilities.” 31 The financial services industry’s dependence on other infras tructures has been tested in real emergen- cies. For example, in 1988, a fire in the Amer itech central office in Hinsdale, Illinois, dis- abled long-distance tel ecommunications for the Chicago Bo ard of Trade and other major institutions. Wall Street was bl acked out for nearly a week by an electrical fire in a Con- solidated Edison office in August 1990. In April 1992, underground flooding in Chicago caused sustained telecommunication and power outages. Financial institutions faced widespread electrical power outages in the West during the summer of 1996 and in the Northeast during the summer of 2003. “In addition,” according to NSTAC, “the indus try weathered one of the worst terrorist attacks in recent history”: The World Trade Center bombing on February 26, 1993, struck at the industry’s heart, affecting the New York Mercan- tile Exchange and many securitie s dealers and otherwise dis- rupting activities throughout Wall Street. Numerous problems with facilities, systems, pro cedures, and staffs were encoun- tered as firms scurried to recover, and some securities firms’ operations were shut down temporarily. However, none of the most critical services were a ffected, and the ef fect on the econ- omy as a whole was minimal. 32 The financial services industr y also weathered the more de vastating terrorist attack on September 11, 2001, that destroyed the Worl d Trade Center. NSTA C found that these types of events, “led to improved robustness of the financial services infrastructure.” NSTAC’s judgment that the financial servic es industry enjoys robust survivability against a wide range of thre ats is seconded by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) in its study, Making the Nation Safer: The Role of Science and Technology in Countering Terrorism (2002). According to the NAS, the U.S. financial infrastructure is highly secure because of the redundancy of its elec tronic systems: “While no law of physics prevents the simultaneous destruction of all data backups and bac kup facilities in all locations, such an attack woul d be highly complex and difficult to execute, and is thus implausible.” 33   30 United States, The President’s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee, Financial Services Risk Assessment Report (Washington, 1997), 40. 31 Ibid. 32 Ibid. 33 National Academies of Science, Making the Nation Safer: The Role of Science and Technol ogy in Countering Terrorism (Washington: National Academies Press, 2002), 137."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 4. Banking and Finance 90 However, the NSTAC and NAS studies were focused primarily on the threat to the financial services industry fr om cyberterrorists using com puter-based attacks. These studies did not evaluate the threat from EMP attack. An EMP attack would pose the very kind of simultaneous and wide spread threat pos- tulated by the NAS that would be fatal to th e financial infrastructu re but judged by them to be too difficult to execute and implausible for cyberterrorists. EMP effects propagate at the speed of light and would cover a broad ge ographic area. Such an attack potentially could achieve the NAS criteria for financia l infrastructure catastrophe: “simultaneous destruction of all data backups and backup facilities in all locations.” 34 An EMP would probably not er ase data stored on magnetic tape. However, by shutting down power grids and damaging or disrupting data retrieval systems, EMP could deny access to essential records stored on tapes and compact discs (CD). Moreover, because EMP physically destroys electronic systems, it is also in the category of threats that NSTAC concludes are more worrisome than c yberterrorism: “Physical attacks remain the larger risk for the industry.” The vast majority of electronic systems s upporting the financial infrastructure have never been tested, let alone hardened, against EMP. Yet the enormous volume, speed, and accuracy required of the electr onic infrastructure supporting the financial services indus- try allow little or no room for error. Financ ial operations could not tolerate the kind of disruptions or mass systemic destruc tion likely to follow an EMP attack. For example, CHIPS interbank transactions typically involve about $1.4 trillion dollars of business every day, or some $182 billion dollars every hour. 35 CHIPS and Fedwire routinely receive 5 to 10 funds transfer messages each second during peak traffic peri- ods. 36 The Options Clearing Corporation manage s $1.05 billion in average daily premium settlements. 37 On Christmas Eve 2004, a single cred it card association processed over 5,000 transactions per second. 38 Financial institutions also must store tremendous amounts of data. Terabyte portf olios (containing 1 trillion bytes) are now common, and some databases exceed a peta byte (1,000 trillion bytes). Changes in these huge databases must be recorded at the end of every business day. “Dealing with this kind of vol ume, industry utilities cannot afford any interruption in service,” according to NSTAC. An EMP attack, with its potential to disrupt communica- tions possibly for days, weeks, or months a nd to destroy or cha nge databases, would place the financial infrastructure at risk. Although the financial se rvices industry has survived and learned from natural and man-made disasters, those disasters also ha ve exposed vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an EMP attack. According to the staff director for management of the FRB, the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, on the World Trade Center exposed telecom- munications and the concentratio n of key facilities as seriou s weaknesses of the financial   34 Ibid. 35 SWIFT, 2005 Annual Report: Al ternative Connectivity for CH IPS Reinforces Resilience, http://www.swift.com/index.cfm?item_id=59677 . 36 Ibid. 37 One Chicago (April 30, 2002), ONECHICAGO, Options Clea ring Corporation and Chic ago Mercantile Exchange, Inc., Sign Clearinghouse Agr eements, press release, http://www.onechicago.com/060000_pr ess_news/press_news_2002/04302002.html . 38 \"Digital Transactions News,\" Digital Transactions , January 6, 2005, MasterCard Wo rldwide, Digital Transactions, http://www.digitaltransactions .net/newsstory.cfm?newsid=466 ."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 4. Banking and Finance 91 services industry. Equity markets closed for 4 days, until September 15, due to failed telecommunications. The NYSE could not reop en because key central offices were destroyed or damaged, leaving them unable to support operations. According to this sen- ior government official, Fedwire, CHIPS, and SWIFT would cease operation if telecom- munications were disrupted. He further obser ved that ACH, ATMs, and credit and debit cards all depend on telecommunications. Disr uption of these systems would force con- sumers to revert to a cash economy. 39 Further, response to the Northeast power out age in August 2003 has been depicted as a triumph for the financial services industry safeguards implemented since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. But this is not the whole picture. Some analysts observe that the blackout happened under nearly ideal conditions to f acilitate financial industry recovery. The blackout happened on a Thursday at 4:10 p.m., after the 4:00 p.m. closing time for financial markets, and it was largel y over for the financial industry by 9:00 a.m. the following Friday morning. Business was also light, at its nadir, as is usual during August. Even so, recovery from the 2003 blackout st ill required many in the financial industry to work overnight. The American Stock Exch ange did not open because its air condition- ers would not operate. Many traders could not get to work on Friday because the trans- portation system was paralyzed. Some companies were unable to reach the NASDAQ electronic exchange by telephone. Many AT Ms failed. Many of the 1,667 banks in New York City closed on Friday because of c ontinuing power outage. Many industries with back-up generators, like KeyCorp in Clev eland, were unprepared for a blackout that lasted for more than a few hours, and th ey had difficulty getting diesel fuel. The fortunate timing and short duration of the 2003 blackout affected the financial industry for a relatively brief period. Nonethel ess, banks had to compensate for financial imbalances by borrowing $785 million dollars fr om the Federal Reserve System. This was 100 times the amount borrowed the previ ous week, and the greatest amount bor- rowed since the week after the September 11 attacks. 40 Most economists concur that the blackout had a small but measurable effect on the U.S. third-quarter economic growth. These observations suggest that, if an EMP a ttack were to disrupt the financial industry for days, weeks, or months rather than hours, the economic impact would be catastrophic. The prolonged blackout resulting from Hurri cane Katrina in August 2005 is a far better example than the Northeast blackout of 2003 of the challenge that w ould be posed to the financial infrastructure from EMP. The Ka trina blackout, comparable to a small EMP attack, disrupted normal business life for m onths and resulted in a staggering economic loss that is still an enormous drain on the national economy. The financial network is highly dependent on power and telecommunications for nor- mal operations. Widespread power outages w ould shut down the network, and all finan- cial activity would cease until power was restor ed, as happened during Hurricane Katrina. Even if power were unaffected or restored in short order, full telecommunications are required to fully enable the fi nancial network. If critical el ements within the telecommu- nications infrastructure were negatively affected by the EMP attack (i.e., at main and   39 Malphrus, Steve, Staff Director for Management, Fede ral Reserve Board, pe rsonal communication. 40 Jackson, William D., Homeland Security: Banking and Financ ial Infrastructure Continuity, U.S. Congress, March 16, 2004, Congressional Research Service (Washington, 2004), 6, http://www.law.umaryland.edu/marsha ll/crsreports/crsdocuments/RL3187303162004.pdf ."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 4. Banking and Finance 92 local switches), the financial network would be impacted ne gatively to some degree and consequently be highly dependent on the te lecommunication recovery timelines before it could be brought back online with the required capability and capacity. The extent to which the financ ial network is able to functi on as it is being brought back online will be highly dependent on the level of damage incurred by the network as a result of the EMP attack. Consequences of Financial Infrastructure Failure Despite the robustness of U.S. financial infras tructures against a wide range of threats, they were not designed to withstand an EM P attack. Indeed, the highly sophisticated electronic technologies that make the modern U.S. financial infras tructure possible are the components most vulnerable to EMP. An EMP attack that disrupts the financial se rvices industry would, in effect, stop the operation of the U.S. economy. Business transa ctions that create w ealth and jobs could not be performed. Loans for corporate capital ization and for privat e purposes, such as buying homes and automobiles could not be ma de. Wealth, recorded electronically in bank databases, could become inaccessible ov ernight. Credit, debit, and ATM cards would be useless. Even revers ion to a cash economy might be difficult in the absence of electronic records that are th e basis of cash withdrawals fr om banks. Most people keep their wealth in banks and have little cash on hand at home. The alternative to a disrupted electronic economy may not be reversion to a 19th century cash economy, but reversion to an earlier economy based on barter. In the immediate aftermath of an EMP atta ck, banks would find it very difficult to operate and provide the public with the liquidity they require to survive; that is, to buy food, water, gas, or other essential supplies and services. Modern banking depends almost entirely on electronic data st orage and retrieval systems fo r record keeping and to per- form account transactions. An EMP attack that damages the power grid or electronic data retrieval systems would render banking transacti ons virtually impossibl e as a practical or legal matter. Operating a banking system using paper and handwritten transacti ons would be diffi- cult without access to the information containe d in electronic records. If a makeshift paper banking system could be organized on an emergency basis, such a system would be fraught with the risk of fraud, theft, and co stly mistakes. Such a system would not be consistent with the cautious behavior and na tural interest of banks in assigning highest priority to protecting financial assets. Protoc ols and business standard s that are required of banks under their charters for insurance pur poses and to protect them from legal liabil- ity assume the existence of modern electr onic banking systems and the reliability, redun- dancy, and surety that such systems provide. A survey by Commission staff of natura l and man-made disasters found no case in which banks, bereft of their electronic syst ems because of blackout, reopened their doors and did business by hand. Unless banks have well- prepared contingency plans in place to revert to paper and handwritten transactions in advance of a crisis, it is very doubtful that bank managers would have the capability, auth ority, or motivation to attempt a paper and handwritten banking system in the aftermath of an EMP attack. Unless directed by fed- eral authority to create con tingency plans for operating with out electricity, it is doubtful the business community would unde rtake such plans on its own."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 4. Banking and Finance 93 In the aftermath of an EMP attack, indi viduals and corporations would have many sound reasons for being cautious, risk averse, and unwilling to resume business as usual. Once power, telecommunications, and transpor tation are restored, even if restored promptly, within a matter of days, psychologi cal concerns that affect economic revitali- zation may linger. Full recove ry will require restoring the trust and confidence of the business community in the infrastructures, in financial institutions, and in the future. The Great Depression outlasted its proximate cau ses by many years, despite strenuous efforts by the Federal Government to implement financial reforms and jump-start the economy, in part because businesses were unwilling to risk their capital in a system that had lost their confidence. The Department of the Treasury and the SEC sh are the view that failure of electronic systems supporting the critical infrastructur e for even one business day threatens the financial system with wide-sca le disruption and risk to one or more critical markets. Indeed, the Interagency Paper on Sound Practices to Strengthen the Resilience of the U.S. Financial System , by the Department of the Treas ury and the SEC advocates “the overall goal of achieving recovery and resu mption within two hours after an event.” It states: In light of the large volume and value of transactions/payments that are cleared and settled on a daily basis, failure to com- plete the clearing and settleme nt of pending transactions within the business day could cr eate systemic liq uidity disloca- tions, as well as exacerbate credit and market risk for critical markets. Therefore, core cleari ng and settlement organizations should develop the capacity to recover and resume clearing and settlement activities within the business day on which the disruption occurs with the overa ll goal of achieving recovery and resumption within two hours after an event. 41 Partial or small-scale disrupt ion of the financial infras tructure would probably be enough to bring about a major economic cr isis. Nonfunctioning ATM machines, for example, and other impediments to obtaini ng cash might well undermine consumer con- fidence in the banking system and cause a panic. NSTAC observes that the ultimate pur- pose behind all the financial industry’s security efforts is to retain consumer confidence: “The ability of an institution to maintain the trust, and hence, the bus iness, of its custom- ers is viewed as an even greater value than the dollars and cents involved.” 42 A related NAS study concludes that an attack that destroys only electronic records would be “catastrophic and irreversible.” 43 Although it is highly unlikely that stored financial data on magnetic media would be damaged by EMP, th e electronic systems fo r retrieving data are potentially vulnerable to EMP and are de pendent on a vulnerable power grid. Data and essential records are usel ess if inaccessible.

The Federal Government must ensure that this system can survive sufficiently to preclude serious, lo ng-term consequences. The Department of Homeland Security, the F RB, and the Department of the Treasury, in cooperation with other relevant agencies, must develop contingency plans to survive and recover key financial systems promptly from an EMP attack. Key financial services include the means a nd resources that provi de the general popu- lation with cash, credit, and ot her liquidity required to buy essential goods and services. It is essential to protect the Nation’s financial networks, banking record s, and data retrieval systems that support cash, check, credit, debit, and other tr ansactions through judicious balance of hardening, redundanc y, and contingency plans. The Federal Government must work with the private sector to ensure the protection and effective recovery of essential financial records and services infrastructure systems from all deliberate adverse events, including EMP attack. Implementation of the recommenda- tions made by the Department of the Tr easury, the FRB, and the SEC in their Interagency Paper on Sound Practices to Strengthen the Resilience of the U.S. Financial System to meet sabotage and cyberthreats that could engender requirements for protection and recovery should be expanded to include e xpeditious recovery from EMP attack as follows:  “Every organization in the financial servic es industry should id entify all clearing and settlement activities in each critical financ ial market in which it is a core clearing and settlement organization or pl ays a significant role” that could be threatened by EMP attack.  Industry should “determine appropriate r ecovery and resumption objectives for clear- ing and settlement activities in support of critical market s” following an EMP attack.  Industry should be prepared to cope with an EMP attack by maintaining “sufficient geographically dispersed resources to m eet recovery and resumption objectives.... Back-up sites should not rely on the same infrastructure components (e.g., transportation, telecommunicat ions, water supply, electric power) used by the primary site. Moreover, the operation of such sites should not be impaired by a wide-scale evacuation at or inaccessibility of st aff that service the primary site.”  Industry should “routinely use or test reco very and resumption arrangements.... It is critical for firms to test back-up facilities of markets, core clearing and settlement organizations, and third-party service provide rs to ensure connec tivity, capacity, and the integrity of data transmission” against an EMP attack. 45   44 Ibid. 45 U.S. Security Ex change Commission, Interagency Paper on Sound Practices to St rengthen the Resilience of the U.S. Financial System, April 2003."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 5.

While much of that energy originates in natural resources of coal, hydr oelectric, and nuclear materials and is distributed to users th rough the electric power grid, mo re than 60 percent of all U.S. domestic energy 1 usage derives from petroleum (a bout 40 percent) and natural gas (more than 20 percent) and is distributed to users through an extensive national pipeline system. Refined petroleum products and natu ral gas power our cars, heat our homes, energize our factories, and comp rise critical elements of i ndustrial materials ranging from fertilizers to plastics, all enabling the norma l functioning of our energy intensive civil society. In 2006, according to the Annual Ener gy Review, the United States imported an average of 10 million barrels of crude oil and 11.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas every day. Domestically the United States produced about 5 million barrels of crude and 50.6 billion cubic feet of dry gas daily. All of th ese energy resources were delivered from their points of production or ports of entry to user s or further distribu tion points through the national pipeline system. While the closely related petroleum and natural gas infrastructures comprise a variety of production, processing, storage, and deliver y elements, as described in the next sec- tion, the focus of this chapter will be on the delivery system. In particular, we shall focus on the potential electromagnetic pulse (EMP) vulnerability of th e more than 180,000 miles of interstate natural ga s pipelines and the more than 55,000 miles of large — 8-inch to 24-inch diameter — oil pipelines. 2 We shall point to the poten tial vulnerabilities of the electronic control systems — supervisory co ntrol and data acquisition systems (SCADA) — that were discussed in general terms in Chapter 1, but whose criticality and centrality for the operation of the petroleum and natural gas infrastructure distribution systems are particularly prominent. C ontrol system components with low voltage and current requirements, such as integrated circuits, di gital computers, and digital circuitry, are ubiquitous in the U.S. commercial petroleu m and natural gas infrastructures, and EMP- caused failures can induce dangerous system malfunctions result ing in fires or explosions. Infrastructure Description Petroleum The petroleum infrastructure can be divided into two parts: the upstream sector, which includes exploration and produc tion of crude oil, and the downstream sector, which com- prises the refining, transmi ssion, and distribution of the finished petroleum product. Physical components of the upstream sector include land oil wells and waterborne oil rigs for exploration, drilling, and extraction of crude oil. In 2006, there were 274 rotary rigs operating on- and off-shore in the United States and 501,000 crude oil producing wells ( figure 5-1 ). In addition, many elements of th e production of crude oil are located abroad, because the majority of U.S. oil is imported. In contrast to the production stages of petroleum, the United States is the largest pro- ducer of refined petroleum products in the world. In 2006, 149 refineries were producing   1 Annual Energy Review 2006, International Energy Agency. 2 Pipeline 101, http://www.pipeline101.com."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 5. Petroleum and Natural Gas 96 Figure 5-1. Petrol eum Infrastructure 3 approximately 23 percent of the world’s refi nery output. These refineries range in pro- duction capabilities from 5,000 barrels to ap proximately 500,000 barrels per day. Nearly one-half of America’s refining capacity is locat ed along the Gulf Coast, mostly in Texas and Louisiana. Other major refineries ar e found throughout the Midwest and in Califor- nia, Washington, and along the East Coast of the United States. The most pervasive physical element of the o il infrastructure is th e extensive transmis- sion network that moves crude oil from the field to the refineri es for processing and brings the finished products to the consumer . Pipelines are the safest and most economi- cal way to accomplish this and account for n early 50 percent of all crude oil received in domestic refineries in 2006. Tankers transpor t an additional 46 percent of the crude oil received by refineries, with the remaining crude oil delivered to refineries by barge, rail tank car, and truck. There are approximately 55,000 miles of crude oil trunk lines (8-inch to 24-inch diameter) and an additional 30,000 to 40,000 miles of sma ller gathering lines (2-inch to 6-inch diameter) across the Un ited States. The trunk lines connect regional markets, while the smaller gathering lines transport crude oil from the well — on- or off- shore — to larger trunk lines and are located mainly in Texas and Louisiana. Movement of the refined products, such as gasoline, dies el, and jet fuel, to the marketplace is done largely by tankers. In addition, there are approximately 95,000 refined product pipelines nationwide, varying in diameter from 8 to 12 inches to 42 inches, that bring products to their final destinations. Storage facilities are an integral part of th e movement of oil by rail, highway, pipeline, barge, and tanker and can be aboveground, underground, or offshore.

Petroleum and Natural Gas 97 States, the most common storage tank is a boveground and made of steel plates. Most underground storage tanks are made out of st eel as well. These st orage facilities are located at each node in the production and di stribution of petroleum and include tanks at the production field, marine terminals, refineri es, pipeline pumping st ations, retail facili- ties, car gasoline tanks, and home heating tanks. In 2006, the United States imported about 60 percent of its petroleum consumption from abroad. Four thousand U.S. off-shor e platforms, 2,000 petroleum terminals, and 4,000 oil tankers belonging to the world’s energy trading nations and unloading petro- leum at 185 ports in the United States, must also be counted as part of the petroleum infrastructure. Natural Gas The natural gas infrastructure comprises pr oduction wells, processi ng stations, storage facilities, and the nation al pipeline system (see figure 5-2 ). Figure 5-2. Natura l Gas Infrastructure In 2006, there were 448,461 gas- and condensate-producing wells 4 distributed among 63,353 5 oil and gas fields in the United States . There were more than 500 natural gas processing plants 6 and more than 1,400 compressor stations that maintain pressures in the pipeline and assure the forward motion of the transmitted gas supply. Storage facilities included 394 active underground storage fields, c onsisting of depleted oil and gas fields, aquifers, and salt caverns, five liquefied natural gas (LNG) impor t facilities, and 100 LNG peaking facilities. The pipeline system consists of more th an 300,000 miles of inter- state and intrastate transmission lines and an additional 1.8 million miles of smaller dis- tribution lines that move gas closer to ci ties and to individual homes and business.   4 Energy Information Administ ration, About Natural Gas, http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/ natural_gas/analysis_publications /ngpipeline/transsys_design.html . 5 Energy Information Administration, Oi l and Gas Code Fiel d Master List, 2006. 6 Natural Gas Processing Plants, 1995-2004 EIA 6/2006."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 5. Petroleum and Natural Gas 98 Most of the natural gas consumed in the United States is produced domestically. His- torically domestic producti on has accounted for around 85 pe rcent of U.S. consumption with imports from Canada making up the rema ining 15 percent. In recent years, domestic production has fallen to about 75 percent of consumption with the remainder imported from Canada. In 2005, five states — Texa s, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Louisiana, and New Mexico — accounted for 77 percent of domestic natural gas production. Direct Effects of EMP on Petroleu m and Natural Gas Infrastructure The infrastructure described in the previ ous section is dependent on the continuous operation of a wide variety of electrical co mponents: pumps to extract fuel from wells and manage its movement through pipelines, el ectrically driven systems to process mate- rials in refineries, transporta tion systems to deliver fuels to users from storage sites, point-of-sale electronics to pr ocess transactions to retail customers, and so on — all of which represent potential points of vulnerability to an EMP pulse. We shall focus here on the vulnerability due to onl y one of these components — SCADA — because they repre- sent a ubiquitous presence across all the diffe rent infrastructure elements and play a series of critical roles w hose loss would severely compromise, or in some instances eliminate altogether, the ability of the infrastructure to function. SCADA systems themselves, and their tested vulnerability to electromagnetic pulses, were described in some detail in Chapter 1, the introductory chapter to this volume, and we shall not repeat that here. Instead we describe the partic ular role of SCADAs within the petroleum and natural gas in frastructure, and then consider the consequences of an event which degrades or destroys the contro l and monitoring functions performed by the SCADAs. Petroleum Infrastructure and SCADA SCADAs play a critical role at every stag e of the oil industry’s life cycle: production, refining, transportation, and dist ribution. Automation within the oil industry begins at the resource exploration stage and ends with fi nal delivery to the customer. At each step, process control and SCADA are used not only to ensure that operations are efficient, but also that strict safety measures are maintained to prevent injuries and fatalities, fires and explosions, and ecolo gical disasters. SCADA systems, for example, are deployed in production fields, pipeline gathering systems, and along pipelines to monitor and adjust various operati ng parameters. These monitoring functions assist oil companies in preventing leaks and other hazardous condi- tions, as well as minimizing the impact of those that do occur. These systems, which involve two-way traffi c requiring paired channels, allow a master station to monitor and control the status of a multitude of measurements and tolerance limits at wellheads, pump stations, and valves, thus eliminating the need for constant manual surveillance. Figure 5-3 presents a typical SCADA system for offshore oil pro- duction and onshore oil distribution, showing the use of remote terminal units (RTUs) and distributed control systems (DCS) at remo te locations and their connection with the master terminal units (MTUs) th rough various comm unication media. Pumping facilities that produ ce thousands of horsepower of energy and metering facili- ties that measure thousands of barrels per hour are routinely operate d remotely via these SCADA systems. They can be properly opera ted only by using extremely reliable com- munications systems.

Typical SCADA Ar rangement for Oil Operations or decrease output or to shut down altogether. Pipeline co ntrols may include changing routing, increasing or reducing the flow of the liquids or gases, and other functions. However, some pipeline facilitie s still require manual operation. Process control is concerned with maintain ing process variables, temperatures, pres- sures, flows, compositions, and the like at some desired operating value. Process control systems within refineries, along pipelines, and in producing fields were previously closed and proprietary. These control processes ar e now moving toward ope n architecture and commercially available software. The oil infr astructure now relies on e-commerce, com- modity trading, business-to-business systems, electronic bulletin boards, computer net- works, and other critical business systems to operate and connect the infrastructure. These assessment and control tools depend to a large degree on telecommunications and associated information technol ogies. Telecommunication in this context refers to a sys- tem of information linkages and data exch anges that include SC ADA, the associated SCADA communication links, control systems, and integrated management information systems. Natural Gas Infrastructure and SCADA SCADA is essential to modern natural gas operations. These systems provide the near- real-time data flows needed to operate effici ently in a deregulated environment. In addi- tion, SCADA provides reporting of all transac tions, establishing fina ncial audit trails. The key to effectively managing natural gas de liveries to customers is knowing what is happening along an interstate or intrastate pipeline system at all times. This is accom- plished with Gas Control — a centralized command post that continuously receives information from facilities along the pipeline and disseminates information and opera- tional orders to equipment and personnel in the field (see figure 5-4 ). Through the use of SCADA equipment, Gas Control monitors volumes, pressures, and temperatures, as well as the operating status of pipeline facilities. Using microwave, tele- phone, or communication satellites, SCADA pr ovides the Gas Control operator with information on the volume of natural gas flowing into the system and the volume of gas "},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 5. Petroleum and Natural Gas 100 Figure 5-4. SCADA Integrates Contro l of Remote Natural Gas Facilities delivered to customers and gi ves the ability to quickly id entify and react to equipment malfunctions or incidents. SCADA also gives Gas Control the capability to remotely start or stop compressors or open or close valves, thereby vary ing flow volumes to meet changes in customer demand for natural gas. Before the advent of SCADAs, all such functions, including tedious flow com putations, were performed manually. Automation of natural gas operations empl oys electronic components and technology to a high degree. Many of these components use s imple mechanical or electrical properties to perform their defined roles, but an increas ing number of them ar e computer-based. The major components and subsystems are RTUs , programmable logic controllers (PLC), MTUs, and communication systems, both wired and wireless. The total SCADA structure also includes control centers, information technology, personal computers (PC), and other peripheral technologies. RTUs and PLCs are usually located at the remote operational sites and connected to the MTUs and comm unication infrastructure through the commu- nications network. Effects of an EMP Event on the U.S. Petroleum and Natural Gas Infrastructures There are few empirical data to support de finitive statements regarding the precise effects of an EMP event, should one occur. We can only extrapolate from what is known about the effects of various levels of EMP te sting and what is indicated by other types of ongoing tests. It is evident that electronic devices, particular ly those incorporating solid- state circuitry are, to varying degrees, sus ceptible to the effects of an EMP event. The principal electronic components of a SCADA system, those devices most vulner- able to an EMP attack, are found in all the major subsyste ms of the SCADA installation. The MTU is a modern computer, with vari ous solid-state circuits embedded on the microchips contained inside. An EMP event ma y affect these, either as a temporary dis- ruption, which, if not automa tically rebooted, might require manual intervention, or with permanent damage. If MTUs are not physically damaged, it may not be obvious whether their functional state has alte red. As discussed earlier, lo ss of the MTU would blind the Control Center personnel to system data and performance. The physical system (e.g., pipelines, refineries) would continue to ope rate within the limits of the preprogrammed RTU controls, assuming that these components al so have not been adversely affected by the EMP event."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 5. Petroleum and Natural Gas 101 The RTUs and PLCs used in today’s SCADA systems rely on solid-state circuits to maintain their programming and to carry out the directives issued through those pro- grams. This design makes the RTU and PLC inherently vulnerable to an EMP event. Although small, remote installations potentially have less exposure, it can be assumed that some or all of the RTUs and PLCs woul d be affected by an EMP event. As in the case of the MTU, affected embedded, integrated chips are suspect, even if the damage is not total and perhaps not immediately evident. Gas Functional loss of the RTU and PLC results in loss of supervisory control at that loca- tion. The equipment is unable to direct change s in pressure to matc h changes in demand requirements for the natural gas sector. The ga s delivery system should continue to oper- ate, and natural gas should continue to flow , but ultimately the syst em may reach extreme conditions. Due to the presence of backup em ergency pressure regul ation, it is unlikely that such a failure would lead to an unsafe conditi on, one that would cause a rupture or explosion. The most likely resu lt, given no manual interventi on, would be significant loss of pressure after some period of time, leading to massive service disruption. Currently, if any component of the control system (e.g., RTU, PLC, MTU) for the natu- ral gas infrastructure fails, the system still ha s the mechanical ability to operate as it did in the days before SCADA. An EMP-induced false signal might affect operation if the signal unexpectedly closed a valve instead of keeping it open. The SCADA system would then have no ability to adjust to changi ng conditions; however, except in extreme cases such as peak winter demand conditions, it shoul d be able to maintain deliveries until field personnel arrive and institute manual contro l. Discussions with natural gas system operators provide a consensus that it would be highly unlikely that the natural gas pipe- line system would be shut down immediately if it is recognized that there is problem with the field data. Oil If the SCADA system for an oil pipeline is inoperative due to the effects of an EMP event, it is the opinion of a number of form er pipeline personnel that operations would have to be shut down. A petroleum pipeline fa ilure can be catastrophic. Leaking oil could contaminate water supplies and cause disastrous fires. Based on their experience, it has been stated that companies that operate any type of complex pipeli ne system today do not have enough personnel to manually operate the sy stem using on-site operators with tele- phone communications (which may not be ava ilable after an EMP event) to a central control center, due in part to the multiple s ites that need to be monitored and controlled during an emergency. Over the past decade, th ere has been a trend to increase remote control capability while reducing personnel in th e oil and natural gas pipeline industry. U.S. refineries are critically dependent on the computers an d integrated circuitry asso- ciated with process control, which are vulnera ble to EMP effects. Discussions with plant managers and process control en gineers at a number of refi neries gave a nearly unani- mous response that loss of pr ocess control would lead to re finery shutdown. A number of refineries stated they maintain an emergenc y override fail-safe system that institutes a controlled shutdown of the refi nery if various SCADA parame ters are out of range. How- ever, the very short notice of a process c ontrol outage and the emergency shutdown pro- cedure a refinery must undergo significantly increase the potential fo r equipment damage and lost production."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 5.

Petroleum and Natural Gas 103 The petroleum and natural gas infrastructures are critically dependent on the availabil- ity of assured electric power from the nati onal grid, as well as a ll the other critical national infrastructures, includ ing food and emergency services that sustain the personnel manning these infrastructures. In turn, all these infrastructures rely on the availability of fuels provided by the petroleu m and natural gas sector. Petroleum and natural gas systems are h eavily dependent on co mmercial electricity during the entire cycle of production, refining, processing, transport, and delivery to the ultimate consumer. The availability of comme rcial power is the most important depend- ency for the domestic oil sector. The natural gas infrastructure depends on electric power to operate lube pumps for compressors, after-co oler fans, electronic control panels, voice and data telecommunication, computers, SCADA communication and controls infra- structure, gas control centers, a nd other critical components. U.S. oil and natural gas companies operate a variety of telecommunications systems that are used to provide the internal communi cations capabilities that are crucial to pro- tecting the safety of life, heal th, and property. These communi cations facilitie s are critical for the day-to-day operations of these compan ies, as well as for their response to poten- tially disastrous, life-threatening emergency situ ations. They are used for the direction of personnel and equipment, the control and s ynchronization of multiple geophysical acous- tical signal sources for oil and gas exploration, and the te lemetering of geophysical data. Mobile radio plays a critical role in providing communicati ons for the management of individual wells; pipeline gathering systems; and in the transfer, loading, and delivery of petroleum products to end user consumers. In the event of emergency conditions, com- munication systems are essential to ensure th e safety of personnel, the adjacent popula- tion, and the surrounding environment. Petroleum and natural gas infrastructures ar e generally well equipped with gas-driven compressors and gas- or diesel-fired pumpi ng facilities and backup ge nerators that would enable the continued flow of natural gas, crude oil, and refined product deliveries for a limited time or that would implement a contro lled shutdown following an interruption of electric power supply. There is also a possibi lity these backup generators may not func- tion after an EMP event if they contain sensitive electronic co mponents such as electronic control units. As one example of interdepe ndency between the fuel and transportation sectors, we note that emergency generators that may keep critical electrical components of the petroleum and natural gas infrastructur es running may become inoperative for lack of delivered fuel by a transportation sect or short of fuels to run its trucks. An electric power, water, or transportation disruption of short duration would not nec- essarily affect the operation of oil and natura l gas infrastructure due to backup power and water resources. It is antici pated that crude oil and refi ned product deliveries could con- tinue to flow for a few days, should these in frastructures be adversely affected. In the short term, natural gas deliveries are facilita ted by the combined flexibility afforded by underground storage facilities and by line pack (the volume of gas main tained in the line at pressures above required delivery pressures). But outages of a few days or more can be expected to severely affect all infrastructure operations.

T T r r a a n n s s p p o o r r t t a a t t i i o o n n I I n n f f r r a a s s t t r r u u c c t t u u r r e e Introduction Transportation has played an essential role in our development from scattered settle- ments to a modern nation. Maritime (i.e., ocean ic) shipping sustained the first settlements some five centuries ago and remains the most important avenue for intercontinental com- merce today. The 18th century saw the rise of ca nals in the eastern states, and interest in them lasted through the first decades of the 19th century. Later the railroad supplanted canals in the east and opened the western te rritories for large-scale economic develop- ment and settlement. The 20th century witnes sed the advent of th e airplane and the automobile, both of which have radically tr ansformed our economy and society. Water, rail, road, and air transportation now bi nd us together as a nation—economically, socially, and politically. The criticality of transportati on, the impact of potential di sruptions, and the need to address vulnerabilities has recei ved national attenti on. As recognized by the President’s National Security Telecommunications A dvisory Committee (NSTAC) Information Infrastructure Group Report: 1  The transportation industry is increasingl y reliant on informa tion technology (IT) and public information-transporting networks.  Although a nationwide disruption of the transp ortation infrastructure may be unlikely, even a local or regional disruption could have a significant impact. Because of the diversity and redundancy of the United States (U.S.) transportation system, the infra- structure is not at risk of nationwide disruption resulting from information system fail- ure. Nonetheless, a disrupti on of the transporta tion information infrastructure on a regional or local scale has potential for widespread economic and national security effects.  Marketplace pressures and increasing use of IT make large-scale, multimodal disrup- tions more likely in the future. As the infrastructure becomes more interconnected and interdependent, the transporta tion industry will increasingly re ly on IT to perform its most basic business functions. As this occurs , it becomes more likely that information system failures could result in large-scale disruptions of multiple modes of the trans- portation infrastructure.  There is a need for a broad-ba sed infrastructure assurance awareness program to assist all modes of transportation.  The transportation industry could leverage ongoing resear ch and development initia- tives to improve the security of the transportation information infrastructure.  There is a need for closer coordination between the tran sportation industry and other critical infrastructures. The transportation sector of the economy is often addressed as a single infrastructure, but in reality its various modes provide for se veral separate, but related, infrastructures.

Transportation Infrastructure 106 infrastructures. 2 A combination of considerations—i mportance to the economy, potential for loss of life as a result of an electromagne tic pulse (EMP) attack , and criticality to civilian enterprises—has led us to focus on the long-haul rail road, trucking and automobile, maritime shipping, and comm ercial aviation infrastructures. As far as transportation has developed, it is st ill far from static. The forces driving the continuing evolution of the transportation in frastructures can be understood in terms of the pursuit of competitive advantage, which derives from both lower cost and superior performance. Of particular importance, pre ssures for cost reduction have led to wide- spread adoption of just-in-time delivery prac tices. These practices not only reduce costs associated with maintaining large inventor ies, but also create strong dependencies on automated tracking of inventories and automatic sorting and loading to achieve efficient and reliable delivery of supplie s and equipment. Just-in-time delivery is made possible by the application of technological advances in remote tracking, computer controls, data processing, inventory management, telecommu nications, and uninterrupted movement. These technologies are all electronics-based and, hence, potentially vulnerable to EMP. The imperative to achieve superior performance also has led to greater use of electron- ics, which has introduced a potential vulnerability to EMP. The automobile provides a familiar example of this phenomenon. Modern automobiles use electronics to increase engine performance, increase fuel efficienc y, reduce emissions, in crease diagnostic capa- bility, and increase passenge r safety and comfort. To gauge the degree of vulnerability of the long-haul railway, trucking and auto- mobile, maritime shipping, and commer- cial aviation infrastructures to EMP, the Commission has assessed selected compo- nents of these infrastructures that are vital to their operations. Our assessment is based on both data collected from testing conducted under the auspices of the Commi ssion and other available test da ta that have direct appli- cability to transportation in frastructure assessment. For critical components of these infrastructures that we were unable to test—notably airplanes, air traffic control centers, locomotives, railroad control centers and si gnals, and ports—our a ssessment relies on surveys of equipment and communications links. Long-Haul Railroad Railroads excel at carrying voluminous or heavy freight over long distances. Class I railroad freight 3 in 2003 totaled some 1.8 billion tons originated. 4 The major categories of   2 Pipelines are sometimes associated with the transportation infrastructure but can be considered more usefully as part of the petroleum and natural gas infrastructures. 3 The division of railroads into classes based on total operating revenue was a taxonomy defined by the Interstate Commerce Commission in the 1930s. The original threshol d for a Class I railroad was $1 million. In 2006, Class I railroads were those with operating re venues exceeding $319.3 million. In North America, there are currently seven U.S. railroads that are defined as Class I, with an additio nal two Canadian railroads that would be considered Class I if U.S. definitions were applied. The old Class II and Cl ass III designators are rarely used today. Instead, the Association of American Railroads speaks of regional rail roads operating greater than 350 route-miles or generating more than $40 million revenue, local line haul carriers w ith less than 350 route-miles and generating less than $40 million revenue, and switching and terminal servi ces carriers with highly localized functions, http://www.railswest.com/railtoday.html . 4 “Tons originated” is a common term of art and index in the railroad industry used to track freight traffic volume. It is equal to the tons of traffic shipped by rail. Tons originated rail statis tics are available from 1899.   The transportation infrastructures are trending toward increased use of elec- tronics, thereby increasing potential EMP vulnerability.

Transportation Infrastructure 107 freight carried by railroads, illustrated in figure 6-1 , include coal, chemicals, farm prod- ucts, minerals, food products, and a variety of the other goods esse ntial to the operation of our economy. 5 Coal dominates all other categories of frei ght, accounting for 44 percent of Class I rail- road tonnage in 2003. More than 90 percent of this coal, some 700 million tons, is deliv- ered annually to coal-fired power plants. Po wer plants that depend on railroad-delivered coal account for more than one-third of our electricity production. Today, these plants typically have only several days ’ to a month’s supply of coal on site. While this reserve provides a useful buffer, under conditions of a prolonged failure of railroads to deliver coal, these plants would si mply have to shut down. 6 Electricity production would be affected most in the Midwest, Southeast, a nd Southwest, regions more heavily dependent on coal-fired power plants. 7 Railroads have achieved signifi cant gains in efficiency a nd safety by modernizing and automating their operations. Today, freight ra ilways are controlled and operated from a limited number of centralized control centers . For example, the western U.S. Union Pacific tracks are managed from Omaha, NE, and the Burlington Northern/Santa Fe tracks are managed from Dallas, TX. These centers, as well as ope rations throughout the rail system, use extensive communication netw orks for sensing, monitoring, and control. If a railroad contro l center becomes inoperable or lo ses communications with the rail network for any reason, all rail traffic in the affected domain will stop until communica- tions are restored or backup procedures are implemented.

Transportation Infrastructure 108 R R a a i i l l r r o o a a d d C C o o n n t t r r o o l l C C e e n n t t e e r r s s We conducted an EMP vulnerability survey of CSX Transportation (CSXT), the rail- road subsidiary of the CSX Corporation. CS XT operates the largest rail network in the eastern United States. Like the other major ra ilroad companies, CSXT has centralized its critical control facilities in a single geographical area. The CSXT Jacksonville, FL, rail- road control center includes three key nodes, each housed in a separate building—a cus- tomer service center, an advanced IT center, and a train dispatch center ( figure 6-2 ). These buildings have no specific electroma gnetic protection. About 1,200 trains are han- dled by the CSXT control center in a typical day. Railroad control center opera- tions rely on modern IT equip- ment—mainframe and personal computers, servers, routers, local area networks (LAN), tape storage units—some of which are similar to commercial off- the-shelf (COTS) equipment that has been EMP-tested. Based on this similarity, we expect anomalous responses of the IT equipment to begin at EMP field levels of approximately 4 to 8 kV/m. We expect damage to begin at fields of approximately 8 to 16 kV/m. The CSXT railroad control center buildings re ly on diesel power generators for standby power and central uninterrup tible power supply (UPS) systems to provide continuous power to critical loads. Some buildings requi re chilled water for continuing computer operations. The buildings are interconnected by a fiber-optic ring and telephone lines. None of this equipment has specific EMP protection, and th ere are no data on the EMP vulnerability of this equipment. The three railroad control center nodes are al most totally dependent on telephone lines (copper and fiber) for communications and data transfer. If all la ndlines fail, they still can communicate over a small number of satellite telephones, but data transfers would be severely limited. Concerns about terrorist attacks and hurricanes have motivated CSXT to make provisions to operate for an extended period without support from the infra- structure. These provisions include diesel generators in case the two independent commercial power feeds should fail, fuel and food stored for 25 to 30 days of operation, beds for 50 people, and on-site wells to provide water. In addition, all three of the key nodes have re mote backup sites, either in Maryland or in the northern Midwest. This geographical dispersion provides so me protection from a limited EMP attack. However, these backup s ites rely on personnel in the Jacksonville Figure 6-2. CSXT Train Dispatch Center   Based on our assessment and test results, a weak link in the railroad infra- structure is the railroad signal controls, which can malfunction and slow railroad operations following exposure to EMP fields as low as a few kV/m. "},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 6. Transportation Infrastructure 109 area for operations at the remote sites, which makes them dependent on the infrastructure for transporting their personnel. It is possibl e that their personnel could be transported over the CSXT rail system if air and road transportation was interrupted by an EMP attack. They also are dependent on commercia l telephone service to transfer the Jackson- ville telephone numbers to the alternate site s and to establish the alternate data links. In the case of EMP-caused outages of the th ree key facilities and the failure of the backup sites, railroad operati ons would be severely degrad ed. Customers could not place shipping orders, data processing would cease, and, most important, tr ain orders could not be generated. Train orders define the makeup of trains, their routes, a nd their priorities on the track. Trains cannot operate without orders and would reve rt to fail-safe procedures. The first priority would be to stop the trains . If it were apparent that the outages would last for more than a few hours, efforts would be made to move the trains to the yards. This process could take up to 24 hours. Once the trains and their crews are secured, plans would be made to resume operations under manual procedures. Implementation of ma nual procedures could take several days or longer, during which time it would be difficu lt to operate at more than approximately 10 to 20 percent of normal capacity. Train orders can be issued manually using satellite telephones. The biggest challenge is maintain ing communications with trains that are underway. Train yards can comm unicate with trains by radio. If the trains are within about 20 miles of the yard, the entire communi cation path is wireless. However, longer- range communications use landlines to repe ater stations along th e train routes. The repeater station batteries provide on ly about 24 hours of standby power. Shipment of critical supplie s likely could resume under manual control operations. Transporting food from farms to storage ware houses and from storage warehouses to cit- ies would be a high priority. Trains also deliv er chemicals that citie s use to purify drink- ing water and treat waste water. As discusse d above, power plants generally have some reserve of coal on hand, but ev entually it would become crucial to resume coal shipments to power plants. R R a a i i l l r r o o a a d d S S i i g g n n a a l l C C o o n n t t r r o o l l s s Railroads use two main types of contro ls: block controls and local controls. Figure 6-3 shows a typical block signal control equipmen t enclosure and antenna . Block controls are used to assure that the next section (block) of track is clear before a train enters it. The main communications from the railroad control centers to the block controls uses a mix of radios and telephones. Block controls have battery backups that can sustain operations for up to 24 hours. Local control systems manage grade crossi ngs and signal both the train and the road traffic at a crossing. These control systems are designed to operate autonomously. Some modern local control systems have a minimal communications capability that consists of a telephone modem for fault reporting a nd possible downloading of programs and parameters for the controllers. Local contro l systems have battery back-up power, which would provide for normal operations from 8 to 48 hours, depending on the volume of train traffic."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 6. Transportation Infrastructure 110 Figure 6-4 shows a typical local grade crossing control shelte r and sensor connection. Local control systems have sensors bolted or welded directly to the rails. The resistance of the circuit, closed by the train wheels and axle, is measured and used to predict the train’s arrival at the crossing. Modern systems are in shielded steel enclosures that include extensive surge protection. Similar electronics technologies are used in both road and rail signal controllers. Based on this similarity and previous test experience with these types of electronics, we expect malfunc- tion of both block and lo cal railroad signal controllers, with latchi ng upset beginning at EMP field strengths of approximately 1 kV/m and permanent damage occurring in the 10 to 15 kV/m range. The major effect of railroad signal control failures will be delayed traffic. For centrally controlled areas of track, if block signals were inoperative, manual bloc k authority would be implem ented. Where possible, signal teams would be sent out to manually contro l failed switches. Crews also would set up portable diesel units to power railroad crossings that had lost power. Railroad crossing generators are on hand for emergencies, such as hurricanes. Repair and recovery times will be on the order of days to weeks. If commercial power is unavailable for periods longer than approximately 24 hours, degraded railroad operations will persist under man- ual control until batteries or co mmercial power is restored.

Grade Crossing Shelter and Sensor Connection L L o o c c o o m m o o t t i i v v e e s s We conducted an assessment of diesel-elect ric locomotives at the GE Transportation Systems plant (one of two manufacturers of diesel-electric locomotives) in Erie, PA. Our assessment is based on a review of locomotiv e construction practices , operational proce- dures, and limited test data. While we do not have direct test data on EMP effects on die- sel-electric locomotives, some data are availa ble from a test of a locomotive of different Figure 6-3.

Transportation Infrastructure 111 design that may provide some insight into the robustness of typical locomotive control electronics and subsystems. 8 Two classes of locomotives were consider ed—those of the pre-microprocessor era and the more modern locomotives that make ex tensive use of electr onic controls. Approxi- mately 20 percent of the locomotive population is of the older generation; these are rap- idly being replaced by the newer models. Electronics are not used to control critical functions in the older locomotives. We consid er this generation of locomotives to be immune to EMP effects. While the locomotives themselves are considered immune, loss of communications with central dispatch or within the train requires that the engineer stop the train. A block diagram showing the critical functions in the more modern locomotives is shown in figure 6-5 . The major functions are traction (movement) and communications, both of which make extensive use of electr onic components and, thus, are potentially vulnerable to EMP. As with older locomotiv es, the communications include communica- tions to central dispatch and to other parts of the train. If these communications are lost for any reason, the train is required to stop.

Modern Locomoti ve Functional Block Diagram The traction function is totally computer c ontrolled, with the important exception of the engineer’s emergency braking system. Three co mputers are used to control all major sub- systems. Malfunction or loss of any of the computers will bring the train to a halt. Restoring operation could require the replac ement of computers. Because few spare com- puters are provisioned, operations could be degraded until new computers are manufac- tured and installed—a proce ss that could take months. It is important to note that computer failure or total loss of power in the locomotives could cause loss of electrical control for the br akes. In this case, there is a totally inde- pendent, nonelectrical system that the engine er can activate to apply the brakes in both the engine and the cars, thereby halting the tr ain. Therefore, even in the worst case, the engineer can stop the train a nd prevent train crashes. Because we did not directly test EMP eff ects on diesel-electric locomotives, the EMP vulnerability levels can be estimated base d only on existing data for computer network response, locomotive construction methods, and the limited data available from the pre- viously referenced test on an electro-mechan ical locomotive belonging to the Swiss Fed-   8 Hansen, R.A., H.

Transportation Infrastructure 112 eral Railroad. 9 Existing data for computer networks s how that effects begi n at field levels in the 4 to 8 kV/m range, and damage starts in the 8 to 16 kV/m range. For locomotive applications, the effects thresholds are exp ected to be somewhat higher because of the large metal locomotive mass and use of shielded cables. Therefore, we expect that effects will likely begin at incident field levels above the 20 to 40 kV/m range. In summary, we consider the older generation of locomotives to be generally immune to EMP effects. Newer, electronically controlled locomotives are potentially more vul- nerable. Based on construction practices, we expect that these vul nerabilities may mani- fest at EMP levels greater than 20 to 40 kV/m. While vulnerabilities may cause the loco- motives to malfunction, fail-safe procedures ensure they can be stopped manually by engineers. Hence, we do not anticipate cat astrophic loss of life following EMP exposure. Rather, we anticipate degraded operations, the severity of which depends on the incident EMP field levels. Normal locomotive operations can be restored on time scales from days to weeks or even longer. Restoration time scales could extend to months if computers, for which there are few spares, must be manufactured and replaced. The Automobile and Trucking Infrastructures Over the past century, our society and ec onomy have developed in tandem with the automobile and trucking industries. As a c onsequence, we have become highly dependent on these infrastructures for ma intaining our way of life. Our land-use patterns, in particular, have been enabled by the automobile and trucking infrastructures. Distances between subur ban housing developments, shopping centers, schools, and employment centers enforce a high dependence on th e automobile. Subur- banites need their cars to get food from the grocery stor e, go to work, shop, obtain medi- cal care, and myriad other activ ities of daily life. Rural Americans are just as dependent on automobiles, if not more so. Their needs are similar to those of suburbanites, and travel distances are greater. To the extent that city dwellers rely on available mass transit, they are less dependent on pers onal automobiles. But mass tr ansit has been largely sup- planted by automobiles, except in a few of our largest cities. As much as automobiles are important to maintaining our way of life, our very lives are dependent on the trucking industry. The hea vy concentration of our population in urban and suburban areas has been enabled by the ability to continuously supply food from farms and processing centers far removed. Toda y, cities typically have a food supply of only several days available on grocery shelves for their customers. Replenishment of that food supply depends on a continuous flow of truc ks from food processing centers to food distribution centers to warehouses and to gro cery stores and restaurants. If urban food supply flow is substantially interrupted fo r an extended period of time, hunger and mass evacuation, even starvation and anarchy, could result. Trucks also deliver other essentials. Fuel delivered to metropolit an areas through pipe- lines is not accessible to the publ ic until it is distributed by tanker trucks to gas stations. Garbage removal, utility repa ir operations, fire equipment, and numerous other services   9 The Swiss executed both free-field ( up to 25 kV/m) and current-injection (up to 2 kA) tests on a 4.6 MW, 80-ton electro-mechanical locomotive in both power-on and power-off configurations.

Transportation Infrastructure 113 are delivered using specially outfitted trucks. Nearly 80 percent of all manufactured goods at some point in the chain from manufact urer to consumer are transported by truck. The consequences of an EMP attack on the automobile and trucking infrastruc- tures would differ for the first day or so and in the longer te rm. An EMP attack will certainly immediately disable a por- tion of the 130 million cars and 90 mil- lion trucks in operation in the United States. Vehicles disa bled while operating on the road can be expected to cause accidents. With modern traffic patterns, even a very small number of disabled vehicles or accidents can cause debilitating tr affic jams. Moreover, failure of electroni- cally based traffic control signals will exacerba te traffic congestion in metropolitan areas. In the aftermath of an EMP attack that occu rs during working hours, with a large number of people taking to the road at the same time to try to get home, we can expect extreme traffic congestion. Eventually, however, peopl e will get home and roads will be cleared as disabled cars are towed or pushed to the side of the road. After the initial traffic congestion has subs ided, the reconstitution of the automobile and trucking infrastructures will depend primar ily on two factors—the availability of fuel and commercial power. Vehicles need fuel and service stations need electricity to power pumps. Few service stations have backup gene rators. Thus, replenishing the fuel supply and restoring commercial power will pace the return to normal ope rations. Similarly, restoration of traffic control systems will de pend on the availability of commercial power and on the repair of damaged traffic control signals. EMP Vulnerability of the Automobile and Trucking Infrastructures We tested the EMP susceptibility of traffic light controllers, automobiles, and trucks.

A Typical Signalized Intersection   Our test results show that traffic light controllers will begin to malfunction fol- lowing exposure to EMP fields as low as a few kV/m, thereby causing traffic con- gestion. Approximately 10 percent of the vehicles on the road will stop, at least temporarily, thereby possibly triggering accidents, as well as congestion, at field levels above 25 kV/m. "},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 6. Transportation Infrastructure 114 Control systems are implemented according to one of several specifications that have evolved over the years. We performed tests of 170E type controllers, in use in approxi- mately 80 percent of signalized intersections . We tested a single controller box populated by multiple electronics cards. In the course of the testing, various cards were damaged and subsequently replaced to continue the testing. Four different types of effects were observed during intersection controller tests: 1. Forced Cycle: At field levels of 1 to 5 kV/m, the light wa s forced to cycle from green to red without going through ye llow. This is a transient e ffect that recovers automati- cally after one cycle. 2. Disrupted Cycle: At field levels of 5 to 10 kV/m, the normally programmed cycle times became corrupted and change to a cycle different from that originally pro- grammed. The controller had e ither been damaged or needed to be manually reset. 3. No Cycle: At 10 to 15 kV/m, the side st reet lights at an inte rsection never turned green. The controller had been damaged. 4. Flash Mode: Also at 10 to 15 kV/m, the in tersection went into a mode in which the lights in all directions were flashing. This mode can cause large traffic jams because traffic flow is severely reduced in this situation. The controller has either been dam- aged or needs to be manually reset. Based on these results, we anticipate that EM P will trigger moderate to severe traffic congestion in metropolitan areas. The traffic congestion may be exacerbated by the panic reactions possibly attendant to an EMP attac k. None of the data pr edict or suggest life- threatening conditions; conflicting green light s did not occur during our tests. All the observed effects would cause less traffic di sruption than would a power outage, which results in no working traffic lights. The highway network’s dependency on electr ical power was demonstrated during Hur- ricane Isabel in 2003. Although some critical intersections were equipped with back-up power supplies, they typically were opera tional only for 24 hours. In many localities, during power outages, law enforcement officers were required to control the critical intersections. As such, these officers were ta ken away from other activities that they could be serving during emergencies. Reestablishing normal traffic flow depends on the severity of the EMP-induced faults. Manual resets for all traffic si gnals in a medium-si zed city (populati on of 500,000) can be accomplished in approximately a day, assuming available personnel. 10 The timeline for repairing damaged traffic controller boxes depend s on the availability of spare parts. The timeline for either manual resets or re pairs under stressed conditions are unknown. Major metropolitan areas are establishing tra ffic operations centers (TOC) as an inte- gral part of their traffic c ontrol infrastructure. A city’s TOC is responsible for download- ing the parameters controlling traffic signa l timing and traffic signal coordination. How- ever, a TOC is not a critical node from a tra ffic control standpoint. If the center were to become inoperable, the immediate effect would be on the city’s integrated traffic system; the city would not be able to monitor its roadways, use its variable message signs along priority roadways such as inte rstates, or produce content for th e cable channels or Internet updates that provide the public with inform ation on traffic and highway conditions. The primary long-term effect of a TOC failure w ould be a gradual drifting of the signal timing synchronization that the center provides to the intersections to which it connects.   10 Conversation with Colorado Sp rings lead traffic engineer."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 6. Transportation Infrastructure 115 A A u u t t o o m m o o b b i i l l e e s s The potential EMP vulnerability of automob iles derives from the use of built-in elec- tronics that support multiple automotive f unctions. Electronic components were first introduced into automobiles in the late 1960s . As time passed and electronics technolo- gies evolved, electronic applic ations in automobiles proliferated. Modern automobiles have as many as 100 microprocessors that co ntrol virtually all func tions. While electronic applications have proliferated within autom obiles, so too have application standards and electromagnetic interference and electromagnetic compatib ility (EMI/EMC) practices. Thus, while it might be expected that incr eased EMP vulnerability would accompany the proliferated electronics applications, this trend, at least in part, is mitigated by the increased application of EMI/EMC practices. We tested a sample of 37 cars in an EMP simulation laboratory, with automobile vin- tages ranging from 1986 through 2002. Automobile s of these vintages include extensive electronics and represent a si gnificant fraction of automobiles on the road today. The testing was conducted by exposing running an d nonrunning automobiles to sequentially increasing EMP field intensities. If anomalous response (either tem porary or permanent) was observed, the testing of that particul ar automobile was stopped. If no anomalous response was observed, the testi ng was continued up to the fi eld intensity limits of the simulation capability (approximately 50 kV/m). Automobiles were subjected to EMP enviro nments under both engine turned off and engine turned on conditions. No effects were subsequently observed in those automobiles that were not turned on during EMP exposure. The most serious effect observed on run- ning automobiles was that the motors in three cars stopped at field strengths of approxi- mately 30 kV/m or above. In an actual EMP exposure, these vehicles would glide to a stop and require the driver to restart them. Electronics in th e dashboard of one automobile were damaged and required repair. Other effects were relatively minor. Twenty-five automobiles exhibited malfunctions that co uld be considered only a nuisance (e.g., blinking dashboard lights) and did not require driver intervention to correct. Eight of the 37 cars tested did not exhib it any anomalous response. Based on these test results, we expect few au tomobile effects at EMP field levels below 25 kV/m. Approximately 10 percent or more of the automobiles exposed to higher field levels may experience serious EMP effects, in cluding engine stall, that require driver intervention to correct. We furt her expect that at least two out of three automobiles on the road will manifest some nuisance response at these higher field levels. The serious mal- functions could trigger car crashes on U.S. highways; th e nuisance malfunctions could exacerbate this condition. The ultimate result of automobile EMP exposure could be trig- gered crashes that damage many more vehicl es than are damaged by the EMP, the conse- quent loss of life, and multiple injuries. T T r r u u c c k k s s As is the case for automobiles, the potential EMP vulnerability of trucks derives from the trend toward increasing us e of electronics. We assesse d the EMP vulnerability of trucks using an approach identical to that used for automobiles. Eighteen running and nonrunning trucks were exposed to simulated EM P in a laboratory. The intensity of the EMP fields was increased until either a nomalous response was observed or simulator limits were reached. The trucks ranged from gasoline-powered pickup trucks to large die- sel-powered tractors. Truck vi ntages ranged from 1991 to 2003."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 6. Transportation Infrastructure 116 Of the trucks that were not running dur ing EMP exposure, none were subsequently affected during our test. Thirteen of the 18 trucks exhibited a re sponse while running. Most seriously, three of the truck motors stopped. Two could be re started immediately, but one required towing to a ga rage for repair. The other 10 trucks that responded exhib- ited relatively minor temporary responses that did not require driver intervention to cor- rect. Five of the 18 trucks tested did not exhibit any an omalous response up to field strengths of approximately 50 kV/m. Based on these test results, we expect few truck effects at EMP field levels below approximately 12 kV/m. At higher field levels, 70 percent or more of the trucks on the road will manifest some anomalous response following EMP exposure. Approximately 15 percent or more of the trucks will experien ce engine stall, sometimes with permanent damage that the driver cannot correct. Similar to the case for automobiles, the EMP impact on trucks could trigger vehicle crashes on U.S. highways. As a result, many mo re vehicles could be damaged than those damaged directly by EMP exposure. Maritime Shipping The key elements of the maritime infrastructure are ocean-going ships and their ports. We did not perform an EMP assessment of ships. There are more than 100 major public ports in the United States located along the Atlantic, Pacific, Gulf of Mexico, and Great Lakes coasts, as well as in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Deep-draft ports accommodate ocean- going vessels, which move more than 95 percen t of U.S. overseas trade by weight and 75 percent by value. 11 Ports handle a variety of cargo categorized as bulk cargo, including liquid bulk (e.g., petroleum) and dry bulk cargo (e.g., grain); break bulk cargo in barrels, pallets, and other packages; and general cargo in steel contai ners. Major commodities shipped through U.S. ports include: 12  Crude petroleum and petroleum products—oil and gasoline  Chemicals and relate d products—fertilizer  Coal—bituminous, metallurgical, and steam  Food and farm products—wheat and wheat flour, corn, soybeans, rice, cotton, and coffee  Forest products—lumber and wood chips  Iron and steel  Soil, sand, gravel, rock, and stone Port Operations Our assessment of maritime shipping infras tructure focuses on ports. EMP assessments were conducted for the Port of Baltimore in Maryland and ports in the Hampton Roads, VA, area. The Port of Baltimore assessment was performed at the Seagirt and Dundalk Marine Terminals. The assessment was hoste d by the Maryland Port Administration. The Hampton Roads assessment was hosted by th e U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and conducted   11 American Association of Port Authorities, http:/ /www.aapa-ports.org . 12 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 6. Transportation Infrastructure 117 at their offices in Portsmouth, VA, and at th e Norfolk International Terminal (NIT) in Norfolk—one of three terminals in the Hampton Roads area. Under Coast Guard mandate, the National Vessel Movement Center (NVMC) was established to track notice of arrival inform ation from ships entering all U.S. ports. The NVMC is located in Kearneyville, WV. All cargo ships greater than 300 gross tons must notify the NVMC at least 96 hour s prior to their arrival. For the ports of Baltimore and Hampton Ro ads, communications between ships and between ship and shore are primarily by way of very high freque ncy (VHF) radio. All vessels are required to monitor Channel 16 (156.8 MHz). A system of repeaters allows VHF communications 25 miles off shore. So me vessels have satellite communication systems. All vessels are brought into the por ts by a pilot who boards the ship in open water. H H a a m m p p t t o o n n R R o o a a d d s s A A r r e e a a P P o o r r t t NIT, one of the Hampton Roads area facilities, operates much like a bus stop. Ships with 2,000 to 4,000 containers arrive any hour of the day, any day of the week. A few hundred containers may be offloaded and additional containers loaded onboard. Then, after only 4 to 8 hours in port, the ship sails on to its next port. Most of the ships have regular routes. Some ships (15 percent) c ontain break bulk cargo, which is packaged cargo not in containers. The thir d type of cargo is bulk (like coal); however, NIT does not handle bulk cargo. Containers are loaded on a nd off the vessels using sophis ticated cranes designed spe- cifically for the purpose ( figure 6-7 ). The containers typically are loaded onto the chassis of yard trucks that shuttle them to stor age locations around the port. In some cases “straddle carriers” are used instead of yard trucks. Figure 6-7. Container Cran es and Stored Containers Cranes are the key element in the operation of the terminal. The criticality of the cranes is underscored by the fact that repair crews ar e kept on site at NIT at all times. Repairs are required to be made in 15 minutes or le ss. Cranes have more than 100 computers and sensors in them. Replacement parts for normally anticipated failures are warehoused on site. However, the numbers of spares are not planned in anticipation of an EMP attack. Each container has a unique identificatio n number. The container number is noted when it is unloaded from a ship. When it is pl aced in the yard by one of the yard trucks (or straddle carriers), its parki ng place is sent to the data center in Portsmouth through a handheld wireless computer. All the container location data are mirro red to the data cen- ter at NIT and backed up daily. The data cen ters have UPS and diesel backup power.

Eventually, the container is load ed onto a road truck or rail car for shipment to its des- tination. A container number is logged whenever the c ontainer passes through the entrance area. The final checkpoint has radiatio n detectors to look for radioactive materi- als that might be moved out of the terminal. P P o o r r t t o o f f B B a a l l t t i i m m o o r r e e The 275-acre Seagirt Marine Terminal is ex clusively a container terminal. On the land side, containers arrive and l eave primarily by truck (95 percent), even though the terminal is adjacent to CSX railroad’s Intermodal Cont ainer Transfer Facility (ICTF). Seagirt has seven active electric cranes for loading and unloading ship containers. Like NIT, the Seagirt cranes rely on commerc ial power for their operation. Nearby Dundalk Marine Terminal is more than twice as large (570 acres) and has a mixture of cargo types: passengers on cruise sh ips, containers, roll-on/roll-off (ro-ro), and break bulk. Dundalk does not process bulk carg o. The terminal has 10 dockside container cranes, which are of various vintages, all older than the Seagirt cranes. The Dundalk dockside cranes all use diesel-powered electric motors. Dundalk docks on the channel next to Seagir t are used for ro-ro and break bulk cargos. Ro-ro cargos include automobiles and a larg e assortment of fa rm and construction equipment. Both marine terminals use an assort- ment of diesel- and diesel/electric-pow- ered equipment to move containers around the yard and onto and off of trucks and railroad cars. Diesel-powered top loaders are used to move and stack containers. Figure 6-8 shows two of the six diesel/electric- powered rubber tire gantries (RTG) at Seagirt. They provide a more efficient method than the top loaders for moving and stacking con- tainers. Unlike the dockside cranes, whose motion is limited by fixed rails, RTGs can be moved and placed strate- gically around the terminal. Information about the containers is transmitte d to a central computer unit in the Seagirt computer room using wireless handheld Teklogix units ( figure 6-9 ). Information about the status and storage location of each container is stored in the database using input from the handheld units. Conversely, the handheld unit operators can download information about any container from the central database. Th e container tracking systems at Seagirt and Dundalk are highly automated. Their operati on is essentially paperless, which places heavy reliance on the integrity of the databases. To enhance reliability, all critical data are mirrored in near-real time to a nearby backup site (about 1 mile away). In addition, backup tapes are generated every evening. Seve n days of backups are maintained at the backup site. The computer room uses a Li ebert UPS for short-term backup power. Long- term emergency power is provided by a diesel generator. Because the current unit proved Figure 6-8. RTG at Se agirt Marine Terminal"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 6. Transportation Infrastructure 119 to be inadequate during a lightning -induced power outage, a new diesel generator is being installed. The new unit also will provide emergency power to critical equipment outside the computer room. The land side of operations at Seag irt and Dundalk Marine Terminals is primarily concerned with controlling the ingress and egress of container trucks. Entry is regulated by a series of manned consoles overlooking the truck entry area ( figure 6-10 ). Trucks pull up to speaker boxes where the driver provides information about th e company, vehicle, and business at the terminal. Operators use remote cam eras to read license plate numbers and other vehicle identification markings. The operator enters the information in to the database and is issued a routing slip that is printed near the speaker box. The slip looks similar to an airline boarding pass and contains information about the truck and the container with which it is concerned. The driver then proceeds to a manned checkpoint directly below th e entry control consoles. Here, Seagirt personnel examine the routi ng slip and check the driver’s identification before allowing the truck to proceed into the terminal to pick up or drop off a container. A similar check is performed when the truck leaves the terminal. All operations are entered into a database, providing real-time information on the status of each truck and its container. There are typi cally 1,600 truck operations a day at Seagirt. Figure 6-10. Truck Control Station EMP Vulnerability of Maritime Shipping An EMP event could affect operations in ever y phase of the transfer of container cargo from ships at sea to the highways and rails of the United States. The ability to provide information on the cargo and crew 96 hours befo re reaching all ports in the United States could be degraded by EMP-induced failures at the NVMC. Even if the NVMC is not directly impacted by EMP, the ability of sh ips and their agents to communicate with the NVMC could be affected by a failure in the telephone system. The USCG, under the authority of the captain of the port, can allow ships into port without a formal notification to the NVMC. The USCG would likely send one of its cut- Figure 6-9. Handheld Wireless Data Unit"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 6. Transportation Infrastructure 120 ters to contact ships at sea by VHF radio. Its crew might board the sh ip and escort it to port. The choice of which ships to allow in a nd which to stop would be at the discretion of the USCG. Depending on the extent of the EMP-affected areas, ships might also be diverted to alternate ports. Ships approved to enter port still need a pilo t to navigate the inner waterways. Pilots use their own boats to reach the ships and use VHF radios for co mmunication. It is unlikely that all the pilot boats and their radios would be damaged by an EMP event. There are always some that are not operating at any given time. Pilots normally rely on satellites for navigation, but they are capab le of navigating using charts and buoys. 13 An EMP event could slow down the arrival of ships to port, but it would not necessarily stop all arrivals. This was the case for the terminals in the Hampton Roads area after September 11, 2001. The terminals remained op en, but the USCG was aggressive in boarding and escorting ships to port. Once container ships are in port, they are dependent on the dockside cranes to load and unload containers. Most of the container cranes in the Hampton Roads area are powered by commercial power; the few remaining diesel-powered cranes are being replaced by electric cranes. All the dockside cranes at Seagirt also are pow ered by commercial power. The cranes using commercial power have no backup for commer cial power. Thus, loading and unloading of containers would stop at these docks until commercial pow er is restored. The 10 dock- side cranes at Dundalk Marine Terminal ar e diesel/electric and independent of commer- cial power. EMP might damage the container cranes. Th e cranes have myriad electrical compo- nents—programmable logic controllers, sens ors, and motors. However, given their height, it is likely that they are struck frequently by lightning. Wh ile repair crews and replacement parts are kept on site at all times, these parts are unlikely to be sufficient to meet the replacement needs after an EMP attack. Once containers are removed from a ship, th ey are placed in the yard in a numbered parking spot or in block storage, where canis ters are stacked together like on a ship. Die- sel powered yard trucks and straddle carriers ar e used for this purpose. It is unlikely that all of them would be damaged beyond repair by an EMP event. There are always units that are not operating, which, based on the te st data taken on automobiles and trucks, would make them less likely to be damaged. Equipment not damaged by EMP will be able to operate as long as it has diesel fuel. Typically, a 10-to-20 day supply of fuel is stor ed at the terminals. They normally rely on commercially powered electric pumps to move fuel out of the storage tanks, but would improvise alternate methods if there was an extended outage of commercial power. The actual delivery and removal of containers from the ports is dependent on outside trucks and, to a lesser extent, railroads. Diesel /electric RTGs are used to move containers   13 Many satellites are likely to be unaffected by either EMP or by enhanced space radiation environment produced by a high-altitude burst (see Chapter 10 of this volume), but there may be some degrad ation as a result of vulnerabilities of receivers or ground stations.   Dockside cranes are electrically pow- ered from commercial power with no backup power source; loss of commercial power caused by EMP exposure would halt loading and unloading until electric power service is restored. "},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 6. Transportation Infrastructure 121 on and off trucks and rail cars. While RTGs are the most efficient method for moving containers, in the event they all failed, it is possible to lo ad and unload containers with diesel-powered top loaders. Even ordinary fo rklifts could be used in an emergency. Ro-ro operations are less dependent on the operation of terminal equipment. Cranes are not used to unload the equipment—it just rolls down a ramp. Some break bulk cargo ships have their own cranes for dockside operations. Container-handling equipment is only part of the port operations process. Record keeping is as important. Each container arriving at the port must be tr acked until it leaves the port. If the records are lost, reconciling cl aims of lost containers could have a signifi- cant economic impact. The location of each canister at the Hampton Roads area ports is stored in a database at a data center in Portsmouth. Th e data are mirrored to the da ta center at NIT and backed up daily. Both data centers have a UPS and backup generators. They rely on telephone lines to receive data and to communicate with each other. It is unlikely that both data centers would be so damage d by EMP that they could not operate. They use multiple personal computers from different manufacturers to process the data. The NIT data center, which was visi ted as part of the assessment, uses Win- dows ® software for some applications and Macintosh ® software for others. This diversity in location, hardware, and software makes it less likely that there will be a total failure of the data processing system. Even if all data on the contai ner locations were to be lost , it would be possible to regen- erate it in a few days. Personnel routinely ro am the yard checking the accuracy of the database. They compare the container’s uni que number with the number of the parking spot. These personnel could reverse the pr ocess and regenerate the database. The arrangement is similar at the Seagirt a nd Dundalk Marine Terminals. They have a central computer room with multiple servers that support the critical databases. The com- puter room also contains the base station for the wireless handheld units, various routers, and myriad telephone cables. There is no shie lding that would limit EMP coupling to the large number of cables in the room. EMP-induc ed upsets should be expected and damage is certainly possible. Critical data are mirrored to another data cen ter about 1 mile away and backed up daily. Both data centers have a UPS and backup gene rators. The backup generator at Seagirt is inadequate to maintain operations and is be ing replaced with a more powerful unit that also will provide backup power to other crit ical equipment, such as the speakers and cameras at the truck gates. It is unlikely that both of the Baltimore area data centers would be so damaged by EMP that they could not operate. They use multip le personal computers of different genera- tions and from different manufact urers to process the data. Th e diversity in location and hardware makes it less likely that there will be a total failure of the data processing sys- tem. Paper records also would be needed to track the containers entering and leaving both the land and sea sides of the port. The ports could operate at signi ficantly reduced capac- ity using a paper-based tracking system if nece ssary. It likely would ta ke several days to implement the process. Successful recovery from an EMP event wi ll depend greatly on the availability of power and the ability of the USCG and port personnel to evaluate their situation and"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 6. Transportation Infrastructure 122 modify their operations accordingly. The ev ents of September 11, 2001, and the need to survive periodic hurricanes have fostered the type of planning needed to respond to an EMP event. Although EMP was not directly considered, many of the plans for emergency recovery would be helpful after an EMP event. During the assessment, it was encouraging that people in authority were clearly capable of responding well to unexpected situations. However, their response to an EMP event could improve significantly if they had a be tter understanding of what to expect. Commercial Aviation Air travel has become ingrained in our way of life. There were 72 U.S.-certified airline carriers at the end of 2002, employing 642,000 pilo ts, flight attendant s, mechanics, and other workers. U.S. airlines carried 560 million domestic passengers during 2001, log- ging some 700 billion passenger miles. In additi on, U.S. airlines all carry freight to some extent. Commercial air freight shipme nts totaled about 22 billion ton-miles. 14 The key elements of commercial aviation infrastructure that we assessed are the air traffic control system and the aircraft themselves. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has the responsibility for operating the U.S. air traffic control system with an emphasis on passenger safety. The FAA rigorously controls commercial air traffic—on the ground at airports (by airport to wers), all takeoffs and landings (by Terminal Radar Approach CONtrol—TRACONs), and all en route travel (by air route traffic control centers— ARTCCs). Two essential parts of the FAA air traffic control architecture are (1) comma nd and control through communication among controllers and between cont rollers and pilots, and (2) navigation aids for following proper routes, terminal approaches, and landing. Commercial air traffic in U.S. airspace at altitudes up to 70,000 feet is controlled at all times. U.S. airspace is divided into 24 region s, 21 for the contiguous states and one each for Alaska, Hawaii, and Guam. Each region is controlled by an ARTCC. These centers provide en route control for aircraft at altitudes above 17,000 feet, maintaining safe separation between aircraft and routing aircraft around bad weather. Terminal control is provided for aircraft at lower alti- tudes and on the ground by airport towers. An ARTCC has an operations room ( figure 6-11 ) that consists of rows (banks) of individual control- lers. The region controlled by a center is divided into sections. Aircraft ar e tracked and controlled by individual control- lers and handed from controller to controller as the aircraft moves from section to section. Control passes from ARTCC to ARTCC over a dedicated private network telecommuni- cations link that connects a controller from one facility to the next controller at another   14 Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Figure 6-11. An ARTCC Operations Room"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 6. Transportation Infrastructure 123 facility. En route control is acquired and handed off to a terminal controller in a similar manner. If terminal control is interrupted, en route control takes over. If an en route control center is interrupted, control is turned over to another en route control center. These pro- tocols provide redundant backup capability. Radars are used to acquire and track aircra ft in support of air tr affic control centers. Generally, multiple radars will track an aircra ft. Computers in air traffic control centers process radar information to form mosaic se ctional displays and pass aircraft tracking information from center to center and across sec tions at a control center. Visualization is with a cathode ray tube (CRT) screen; paper printouts are also provided and used as a backup. Given a large number of radars with overlapping coverage, failure of a single radar will not adversely affect commercial air operations. Simultaneous failure of multi- ple radars, as could happen in an EMP att ack, could shutdown all air traffic in the affected region, possibly nationwide. The commercial aircraft in use are primarily jet-powered aircraft constructed by Boeing in the United States, and Airbus in Europe . In addition, there ar e various manufacturers of smaller commuter aircraft. More than any other transportation infrastr ucture, the commercial aviation infrastruc- ture is based on electronics. Everything from fl y-by-wire aircraft fli ght control systems to navigation, communications, engine sensors and controls, and essential ground-based operations depends on microprocessor computer control. Although a shutdown or curtailment of comme rcial aviation would have a severe, per- haps crippling, impact on the airline industry itself, the consequences for critical infra- structures would be less serious. Few vital economic activities are highly dependent on the unique advantage—speed—that commercial air transport has over the various modes of land transport. EMP Vulnerability of the Commerc ial Aviation Infrastructure A A i i r r c c r r a a f f t t Our commercial aircraft EMP assessment wa s conducted based on results of a meeting and subsequent discussions with Boeing elect romagnetics effects (EME) staff. This staff is responsible for assuring that Boeing co mmercial aircraft can operate following expo- sure to nonhostile electroma gnetic (EM) environments. Specifically, we assessed the amount of EMP protection that might be a fforded by protection against lightning and high-intensity radiated fields (HIRF). Moreover, our assessment focused on safety of flight and the capability to land a plane af ter EMP exposure. We did not address con- tinuation of normal flight operations, because we expect that all aircraft will be directed to land immediately on notific ation of an EMP attack. Boeing maintains a strict engin eering protocol for assuring th eir commercial aircraft are protected against nonhostile EM environments. This protocol include s qualification test- ing that is a function of fli ght-critical electronics categorie s, application of immunity standards to electronics boxes (sometimes referred to as line-replaceable units [LRU]), and hardening practices tailor ed to specific requirements."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 6. Transportation Infrastructure 124 EME Qualification Practices fo r Safety-of-Flight Electronics. Boeing assigns electron- ics equipment to categories to differentiate the impact of loss of function. The highest category is reserved for electronics boxes, the failure of which would be considered catastrophic, and could lead to potential loss of the aircraft. Because our assessment focused on safety of flight, this is the most important category for EMP effects. For this category of electronic subsys- tems, EME qualification is performed by a combination of low-level system tests and electronics box immunity tests (see next section). The purpose of the system-level tests is to estimate the intensity of the electromagnetic stresses coupled to the electronics box interfaces (connectors). For lightning (the EM environment most similar to EMP), the box immunity tests are th en used to demonstrat e that the electronics immunity levels are at least a factor of two higher than the coupled st resses. If this mar- gin is not achieved, Boeing adju sts the protection tact ics until this requirement is met. For lower-criticality electronic syst ems, only the box immunity tests are conducted, and there is no explicit relationship to the coupled stress required. There has been significant evolution in the use of electronics in commercial aircraft. For aircraft designs prior to the 777, a direct mechanical/hyd raulic link to the control sur- faces was maintained, thereby minimizing electr onics criticality for safety-of-flight appli- cations. This observation would mitigate in favor of inherent EMP immunity for the nonelectronic subsystems. However, depending on aircraft, there are still some flight- critical functions performed by electronic s, for which EMP immunity is not known. Therefore, even for pre-777 designs, there ar e insufficient data to confirm EMP immu- nity. Additional testing (limited to flight-cri tical electronics) is required to confirm EMP immunity. This testing should include low-le vel system testing to estimate EMP stresses at electronics interfaces and the correspondi ng electronics immunity testing. The recom- mended approach is essentially an extension of the existing lightning protocol to provide coverage for the EMP environment. Boeing considers the 777 to be their first fl y-by-wire design, incor porating more flight- critical electronics than used in earlier designs. Therefore, the newer designs may be more prone to EMP safety-of-flight impact. This potential is significantly mitigated by judicious use of redundancy for flight-critical subsystems. For example, while the flight- control systems use electrical signals rather than mechanical wires for control surface instructions, the primary digital controls ar e backed up by analog signals. Moreover, sig- nificant redundancy (up to four levels) is bui lt into each flight-control subsystem. There- fore, the possible EMP susceptibility is o ffset significantly by car eful, redundant design. Nonetheless, the qualification protocols do not provide adequate coverage for anticipated EMP responses. Therefore, as is the case for the earlier designs, additional testing is required to confirm EMP immunity. This tes ting should address both the EMP stresses at electronics interfaces and th e corresponding immunity testi ng. Because there is more application of electronics in the newer desi gns, more extensive testing will be required than for the earlier designs.   Although commercial aircraft have proven EM protecti on against naturally occurring EM environments, we cannot confirm safety of flight following EMP exposure. Moreover, if the complex air traffic control system is damaged by EMP, restoration of full services could take months or longer. "},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 6. Transportation Infrastructure 125 EME Immunity Testing Standards. The industry standard fo r electronics immunity testing for commercial ai rcraft is RTCA/DO-160D. 15 Boeing uses an internal standard that flows down from RTCA/DO-160D but is tailored to the company’s technical prac- tices. For lightning, damped sinusoid immunity te sting at center frequencies of 1 and 10 MHz is required. Other EMP aircraft testing ha s shown that EMP response tends to be at higher frequencies, generally in the 10 to 100 MHz range. In addition, conducted suscep- tibility HIRF testing is required for fre quencies covering and extending far beyond the EMP range. However, the test amplitudes are lower than might be expected for EMP. Therefore, EMP survivability cannot be direc tly inferred from commer cial aircraft light- ning and HIRF immunity testing standards. EME Hardening Practices. EME hardening in Boeing aircraft is achieved using a com- bination of tactics-stress reduction (e.g., use of shielded electrical cables), redundancy of flight-critical systems (depending on the sy stem, up to four channels of redundancy are applied), and software error detection/corr ection algorithms for digital data processing. The combination of these tactics is adjusted to match the specific requirements of differ- ent electronic subsystems. In addition, harden ing measures may be applied to electronic boxes to increase immunity, if required, to m eet the Boeing specifications that flow down from DO-160D. In summary, the Boeing engineering approach for protection and qualification against nonhostile electromagnetic environments is well established, and it is demonstrated by experience to be sufficient for the EM enviro nments to which the aircraft are exposed during normal operations. While these procedures may provide significant protection in the event of an EMP attack, this position cannot be confirmed based on the existing quali- fication test protocols and imm unity standards. This conclusi on is applicable to all com- mercial aircraft currently in service, including the earlier designs. However, it is particu- larly emphasized for the newer, fly-by-wire de signs that, by virtue of more reliance on digital electronics, may be more prone to EMP effects. A A i i r r T T r r a a f f f f i i c c C C o o n n t t r r o o l l We conducted an EMP vulnerability assessmen t of air traffic control by discussions with FAA engineers and former air traffic controllers and by visits to an FAA facility in Oklahoma City and the ARTCC in Longmont, CO. Moreover, because computer net- works are integral parts of the air traffic control system, existing EMP test data on similar COTS electronics is applicable. Our testi ng did not include the FAA’s private telecom- munications network links connecting the ARTC Cs, such as the FAA Leased Interfacility National Air Space Communications System (LINCS) and more recently the FAA Tele- communications Infrastructure (FTI) Program. 16 These FAA critical telecommunications   15 RTCA, Inc., is a not-for-profit corporation that devel ops recommendations regarding communications, navigation, surveillance, and air traffic management system issues. 16 The FAA LINCS is a highly diverse priv ate network constructed to meet speci fic requirements of a customer with critical mission requirements. The FAA LINCS is the most av ailable private line network in the world with an off- backbone availability requirement of 99.8 percent. More th an 21,000 circuits serve the entire network. More than 200 circuits form the LINCS backbone and satisfy divers ity requirements of 99.999 perc ent availability. Despite natural disasters, major failures of public infrastructures, and the 2001 terrorist attacks, the FAA LINCS survived as designed, keeping the line of communication open between ai r traffic controllers and ai rplanes. In July 2002, the FAA initiated a substantial modernization of its telecomm unications networks to meet its growing operational and mission support requirements and to provide enhanced security features. The new FTI Program is an integrated suite of products, services, and business prac tices that provide a common infrastru cture supporting the National Airspace System (NAS) requirements for voice, data, and video servic es; improve visibility into network operations, service delivery status, and cost of services ; and integrate new technologies as s oon as they emerge.

Transportation Infrastructure 126 networks and services are supported by a nu mber of National Security and Emergency Preparedness (NS/EP) programs available fr om the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) National Communications System (NCS). 17 The main function of ARTCCs is to contro l air traffic in surrounding regions. Regions are divided into sections and aircraft are m onitored from section to section before being handed off to another ARTCC or to an airpor t approach control center. The process is highly computerized with quadruple com puter redundancy and redundant power and internal communication systems. The ARTCCs are composed, in part, of co mputer networks based on commercial com- ponents. Similar components have been EMP te sted and have manife sted latching upsets (requiring manual intervention to restore functi on) beginning in the 4 kV/m peak field range. Permanent damage has been observed in the 8 kV/m range but is more prevalent above 15 kV/m. Based on similarity, it is antici pated that ARTCCs will begin to manifest loss of function following EMP exposure to pe ak fields as low as 4 kV/m; but functions will not be seriously degraded unless exposed to peak fields in excess of 15 kV/m. A large number of radars have overlapping c overage. Failure of a single radar will not significantly impact air traffic control capability. Simultaneous failure of multiple radars, as could happen in an EMP attack, could shut down all air traffic control in the affected region, and possibly nationwide, thereby making it more difficult to assure safe landings. In this case, emphasis for safe landings would shift to airc raft crew and airport towers. Power to all critical components of the FAA system is backed by fuel generator power, and in some instances, uninterrupted through temporary use of large UPSs. Visual flight operations will be in the forefront for coll ision avoidance and landing. Many aircraft will land at airports other than originally intended, as was the case after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Significant challenges arise for safe landing in conditions of low visibility in the absence of navigation and landing aids at night and during adverse weather. There are redundant radio communications w ith aircraft and redundant telephone and microwave communications between air traffi c control regions and airport towers. If communications are lost, responsibility for safe landings will revert so lely to the aircraft crews. If the FAA air traffic control system is damaged by exposure to EMP environments, its reconstitution would take time. The FAA does not have suffic ient staff or spare equip- ment to do a mass rapid repair of essentia l equipment. The FAA collection of radar, communication, navigation, and weather instrume nts spans 40 years. It includes compo- nents from multiple vendors that are connected using a variety of wire, wireless, and fiber links. Some equipment has lightning and electromagnetic interference protection. Accordingly, configuration control is difficult. It would take days to a month or more to bring various components of the control sy stem back online, st arting with communica- tions, followed with navigation aids. As the co ntrol system rebuilds, there is likely to be significant reduction in air traffi c, with constraints to increase intervals for departures, landings, and spacing of aircraft en route. Moreover, the capab ility to restore the air traf- fic control system is dependent on availability of services from other infrastructures. In the event these services are compromised by an EMP attack, the air traffic control resto- ration times will be extended.   17 Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP), http://tsp.ncs.gov ."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 6. Transportation Infrastructure 127 Recommendations Specific actions for each transportation infrastructure follow. Railroads Railroad operations are designed to conti nue under stressed c onditions. Backup power and provisioning is provided for operations to co ntinue for days or even weeks at reduced capacity. However, some existing emergency pr ocedures, such as tr ansferring operations to backup sites, rely on significant warning tim e, such as may be received in a weather forecast before a hurricane. An EMP attack may occur without warning, thereby com- promising the viability of available emer gency procedures. Our recommendations are directed toward mitigating this and other potential weaknesses. DHS should:  Heighten railroad officials’ awareness of the possibility of EMP attack, occurring without warning, that would produce wide-ar ea, long-term disrupt ion and damage to electronic systems.  Perform a test-based EMP assessment of rail road traffic control centers. Develop and implement an EMP survivability plan that minimizes the potential for adverse long- term EMP effects.

F F o o o o d d I I n n f f r r a a s s t t r r u u c c t t u u r r e e Introduction A high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack can damage or disrupt the infra- structure that supplies food to the population of the United St ates. Food is vital for indi- vidual health and welfare and the functioning of the economy. Dependence of Food on Other Infrastructures The food infrastructure depends critically for its operation on electricity and on other infrastructures that rely on electricity. An EM P attack could disrupt, damage, or destroy these systems, which are necessary in making, processing, an d distributing food. Agriculture for growing all major crops requi res large quantities of water, usually sup- plied through irrigation or othe r artificial means using electric pumps, valves, and other machinery to draw or redirect water from a quifers, aqueducts, and reservoirs. Tractors and farm equipment for plowing, planting, tend ing, and harvesting crops have electronic ignition systems and other electronic compone nts. Farm machinery runs on gasoline and petroleum products supplied by pipelines, pumps , and transportation sy stems that run on electricity or that depend on electronic compone nts. Fertilizers and insecticides that make possible high yields from croplands are manufactured and applied through means con- taining various electronic components. E gg farms and poultry farms typically sustain dense populations in carefully controlled e nvironments using auto mated feeding, water- ing, and air conditioning systems. Dairy fa rms rely heavily on electrically powered equipment for milking cattle and for making other dairy products. These are just a few examples of how modern food production de pends on electrical equi pment and the elec- tric power grid, which are both potentially vulnerable to EMP. Food processing also requires electricity. Cleaning, sorting, packaging, and canning of all kinds of agricultural products are perf ormed by electrically powered machinery. Butchering, cleaning, and packag ing of poultry, pork, beef, fis h, and other meat products also are typically automated operations, done on electrically driven processing lines. An EMP attack could render inoperable the elec tric equipment and automated systems that are ubiquitous and indispensable to the modern food processing industry. Food distribution also depends heavily on el ectricity. Vast quanti ties of vegetables, fruits, and meats are stored in warehouses, where they are preserved by refrigeration systems, ready for distribution to supermarke ts. Refrigerated trucks and trains are the main means of moving perishable foods to ma rket; therefore, food distribution also has a critical dependence on the infrastructure fo r ground transportation. Ground transportation relies on the electric grid that powers electric trains; runs pipelines and pumping stations for gasoline; and powers signal lights, street li ghts, switching tracks, and other electronic equipment for regulating tra ffic on roads and rails. Because supermarkets typically carry only enough food to supply local populations for 1 to 3 days and need to be resupplied con tinually from regional warehouses, transporta- tion and distribution of food to supermarkets may be the weakest link in the food infra- structure in the event of an EMP attack. The trend toward modernization of supermarkets may exacerbate this problem by deliberately reducing the amount of food stored in supermarkets and regional warehouses in fa vor of a new just-in-time food distribution system. The new system relies on electronic databases to keep track of supermarket inventories so that they can be replaced w ith fresh foods exactly when needed, greatly reducing the need for large stocks of warehoused foods."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 7. Food Infrastructure 130 The electric power grid, on which the food infrastructure depends, has been compo- nent-tested and evaluated against EMP and is known to be vulnerable. Moreover, power grid blackouts induced by storms and mechan ical failures on numer ous occasions have caused massive failure of supermarket refrig eration systems and impeded transportation and distribution of food, resulting in spoilage of all perishable foods and causing food shortages lasting days or sometimes weeks. These storm- and accident-induced blackouts of the power grid are not likely to have conse quences for the food infr astructure as severe or as geographically widespr ead as an EMP attack would. In the face of some natural disasters like Hurricane Andrew in 1992, federal, state, and local emergency services combined have so metimes been hard pressed to provide the endangered population with food. Fortunately, there are few known instances of actual food starvation fatalities in the United States. In such localized emergencies as Hurricane Andrew, neighboring areas of the disaster area are usually able to provide needed emer- gency services (e.g., food, water, fire , and medical) in a timely fashion. In the case of Hurricane Andr ew, for example, although th e area of the damage was relatively small, the level of damage was extraordinary and many people were affected. Consequently, emergency services were brought in, not just from ne ighboring states, but from many distant states. For example, electri c transformers were brought in from other states to help rebuild the local power gri d. The net result was a nationwide shortage of transformers for 1 year until replacements could be procured from overseas suppliers, who needed 6 months to build new transformers. Hurricane Katrina, one of the greatest natural disasters ever to stri ke the United States, afflicted a much larger area than Andrew. C onsequently, the ability to provide food and other emergency aid was a much greater challenge. The area di srupted by Hurricane Katrina is comparable to what can be expected from a small EMP attack. Recent federal efforts to better protect the food infrastructure from te rrorist attack tend to focus on preventing small-s cale disruption of the food infr astructure, such as would result from terrorists pois oning some portion of the food supply. Yet an EMP attack potentially could disrupt or collapse the f ood infrastructure over a large region encom- passing many cities for a protracted period of weeks, months, or even longer. Widespread damage of the infrastructures would impede th e ability of undamaged fringe areas to aid in recovery. Therefore, it is highly possible that the recovery time would be very slow and the amount of human suffering great, including loss of life. Making, Processing, and Distributing Food The United States is a food superpower. It leads the world in production of the 10 major crops, nine of which are food sources : corn, soybeans, wheat, upland cotton, sor- ghum, barley, oats, rice, sunflowers, and peanut s. The United States is also a world leader in the production of meats, poultry, and fi sh. Of the world’s 183 nations, only a few are net exporters of grain. The United States, Ca nada, Australia, and Argentina supply over 80 percent of the net cereal grains exported worldwide—the United States alone provid- ing more than half. These U.S. exports go far toward alleviating hunger and preserving po litical stability in many nations that lack the resources to f eed their own populations. While most Ameri- cans tend to take for granted the quantity and high quality of food available to them on a daily basis, most other countries of the world regard the United States’ food infrastructure as an enviable economic miracle."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 7. Food Infrastructure 131 In contrast to the United States, many of the world’s nations str uggle to meet the food demands of their populations, even though in some cases those populations are living near or below a subsistence level. Most of the world’s 183 nations, to some degree, are dependent on food imports. Even among the advanced nations, the United States is exceptional for the quantity and quality of its food production. U.S. consumers are supplied largely fr om domestically pr oduced food. In 2002, according to data from the U.S. Departme nt of Agriculture (USDA), some 2.1 million U.S. farms sold about $192 billion in crops and livestock. U.S. farms have 455 million acres under cultivation for crop production. Another 580 million acres in the United States are pasture and range la nd that support ra ising livestock. Raw agricultural commodities are converted to intermediate foodstuffs and edible foods by some 29,000 processing plants located throug hout the United States, according to the Census of Manufacturers. These plants employ about 1.7 million workers, which is approximately 10 percent of all U.S. manufact uring employment and just over 1 percent of all U.S. employment. Most plants are small, but larger establishments account for the major portion of shipments. The 20 largest fi rms in food manufacturing account for about 35 percent of shipments, while in beverage manufacturing, the 20 largest firms account for 66 percent of shipments. The largest 50 firms account for 51 percent of food ship- ments and 74 percent of beverage shipments. Food is supplied to consumers by approxi mately 225,000 food stores, as well as by farmers markets and pick-your-own farms. Away-from-home food service is provided by approximately 850,000 establishments, including re staurants, cafeterias , fast food outlets, caterers, and others. To illustrate how the U.S. food infrastructure works in making, processing, and distrib- uting food from farm to market, here is a concrete example: Washington State is the foremost apple produc er in the United States, with more than $850 million in annual sales and 225,000 acres of orchards, mostly in the Cascade Mountains. A major supermarket chain contra cts through a cooperativ e of medium-sized apple growers in the Spokane area to grow apples. In the course of the growing season, the Spokane apple farmers use a wide array of farm machinery to tend their trees and to a pply fertilizers and pest icides. During the har- vest season, Washington farmers employ 35,000 to 45,000 pickers to harvest their apple crops. Hand-picked apples are loaded onto flat bed trucks and shipped to processing firms belonging to or under contract with the chai n. Apples are processed on an electrically driven assembly line that uses a variety of electromechanical de vices to clean fruit of dirt and pesticide residue, sort and grade apples according to size and qua lity, wax the fruit, and package it into 40-pound cartons. If the apples are not to be sent to market immediately, th ey can be stored for up to 8 months in giant refrigerators. The chain arranges for a shipment of apples to its Maryland distribution center, located in Upper Marlboro, which services its stores in the Washing- ton, D.C., area. A trucking company is contracted for the 4-to-5 day shipment of apples to the East Coast using a refrigerated truck. Th e apples are offloaded at the Upper Marlboro regional distribution center, wh ich makes daily deliveries to the chain’s stores. A refrig- erated truck delivers apples to a Washington, D.C., supermarket. Local residents purchase the apples."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 7. Food Infrastructure 132 This example of how the food infrastructure works for apples from grower to consumer generally is the same for most foods, with di fferences in detail. One important difference is that apples, compared to many other crops, are among those most dependent on manual labor and least dependent on machinery. Yet, cl early the food infrastructure, even for the apple, depends heavily on assembly lines, mech anical sorters and cleaners, refrigerators, and vehicles that, directly or indire ctly, cannot operate without electricity. Vulnerability to EMP An EMP attack could damage or destroy so me fraction of the my riad electronic sys- tems, ubiquitous throughout the food infrastruc ture, that are essential to making, proc- essing, and distributing food. Grow ing crops and raising livesto ck require vast quantities of water delivered by a water in frastructure that is largely electrically powered. Tractors, planters, harvesters, and other farm equipm ent are fueled by petroleum products supplied by pipelines, pumps, and transportation system s that run on electric ity. Fertilizers, insec- ticides, and feeds that make possible high yi elds from crops and livestock are manufac- tured by plants requiring electric power. Food processing—cleaning, sorting, packaging, and canning of all kinds of agricultural and meat products—is typically an automated operation, performed on assembly lines by electrically powered machinery. Food distribution also depends on electricity. Refrigerated warehouses make possible the long-term storage of vast quantities of vegetables, fruits, and meats. Road and rail transportation depend on the electric grid that powers electric trains , runs pipelines and gas pumps, and powers the apparatus for regulating traffic on roads and rails. Because the United States is a food superpower with relatively few farmers, technology is no longer merely a convenience—it is indisp ensable to the farmers who must feed the nation’s population and much of the rest of the world. In 1900, 39 percent of the U.S. population (about 30 million people) lived on farms; today that percentage has plummeted to less than 2 percent (only about 4.5 million people). The United States no l onger has a large labor force sk illed in farming that could be mobilized in an emergency. The transformation of the United States from a nation of farmers to a nation in which less than 2 percen t of the population is able to feed the other 98 percent is made possible only by technology. Cripplin g that technology would be injurious to the food infrastructure with its s ecurity depending on the characteristics of an EMP attack. The dependency of the U.S. food infrastr ucture on technology is much greater than implied by the reduction in the percentage of farmers from 39 percen t in 1900 to less than 2 percent of the population today. Since 1900, th e number of acres under cultivation in the United States has increased by only 6 per cent, yet the U.S. population has grown from about 76 million people in 1900 to 300 million today. In order for a considerably reduced number of U.S. farmers to feed a U.S. national population that has grown roughly four- fold from approximately the same acreage that was under cultivation in 1900, the pro- ductivity of the modern U.S. farmer has ha d to increase by more than 50-fold. Technol- ogy, in the form of machines, modern fertili zers and pesticides, and high-yield crops and feeds, is the key to this revolution in food production. An attack that neutralized farming technology would depress U.S. food production."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 7. Food Infrastructure 133 The food processing industry is an obvious technological chokepoint in the U.S. food infrastructure. Food processing of vegetables , fruits, and all kind of meats is a highly automated, assembly-line operation, largely driv en by electric power. An EMP attack that damages this machinery or blacks out the power grid would stop food processing. The work force in the food processing industry is sized and trained to run a largely automated system. In the event of an attack that st ops the machines from running, personnel would not be sufficiently numerous or knowledgeable to process food the old-fashioned way, by hand. Depending on climate, most foods that are not refrigerat ed would begin to spoil in a few hours or days. Finally, the distribution system is probabl y the most vulnerable technological choke- point in the U.S. food infrastructure. Supe rmarkets typically ca rry only enough food to provision the local population for 1 to 3 days. Supermarkets replenis h their stocks virtu- ally on a daily basis from regional warehous es, which usually carry enough food to sup- ply a multicounty area for about 1 month. Regional warehouses are probabl y the United States’ best ne ar-term defense against a food shortage because of the enormous quantitie s of foodstuffs stored there. For example, one typical warehouse in New York City daily receives deliveries of food from more than 20 tractor trailers and redi stributes to market more than 480,000 pounds of food. The warehouse is larger than seve ral football fields, occupying mo re than 100,000 square feet. Packaged, canned, and fresh foods are stored in palletized stacks 35 feet high. Enormous refrigerators preserve vegetabl es, fruits, and meats and the entire facility is temperature controlled. However, regional warehouses potentially are vul nerable to an attack that collapses the power grid and causes refrigeration and temper ature controls to fail. Moreover, the large quantities of food kept in region al warehouses will do little to alleviate a crisis if it cannot be distributed to the populat ion promptly. Distribution depe nds largely on trucks and a functioning transportation system. Yet storm- induced blackouts have caused widespread failure of commercial refrigeration systems and massive food spoilage. Trends in the grocery industry toward just -in-time distribution ma y reduce reliance on regional warehouses and increase the vulnerab ility of the food infrastructure to EMP attack. Just-in-time distributi on, now being adopted by some supermarket chains in Cali- fornia, Pennsylvania, and New Hampshire, us es automated databases and computer sys- tems to track supermarket inventories in re al time and promptly replenish food invento- ries, as needed, from even larger, but fewer, regional warehouses and directly from food manufacturers. The new system promises to supply customers with fresher foods a nd to greatly reduce industry’s reliance on large inventories of stockpiled foods at regional warehouses. As just-in-time distribution becomes the industr y norm, in the event of an EMP attack, heavier reliance on computers and databases ma y make it easier to disrupt the manage- ment of food distribution, while decreased reliance on regional warehouses could greatly reduce the amount of food available for distribution in an emergency. "},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 7. Food Infrastructure 134   Pulse-current injection and fr ee-field illumination testing on a limited number of refrigerators and freezers indicate that some units will fail from low to moderate EMP levels. This testing indicates that substan tial numbers of people would have to survive without benefit of refrigerated foods fo r an extended period, until repairs or replace- ment refrigerators and freezers could be obtai ned. Massive food spo ilage at stores and regional warehouses is implied. Consequences of Food Infrastructure Failure An EMP attack that disr upts the food infrastructure could pose a threat to life, industrial activity, and social order. Absolute deprivati on of food, on average, wi ll greatly diminish a person’s capacity for physical work within a few days. After 4 to 5 days without food, the average person will suffer from impaired judgment and have difficulty performing simple intellectual tasks. After 2 weeks wit hout food, the average person will be virtually incapacitated. Death typical ly results after 1 or 2 months without food. This timeline would not start until food stockpi les in stores and homes were depleted. Many people have several days to weeks of f ood stored in their homes. For example, in 1996 when a snowstorm in the Washington, D.C ., area virtually paralyzed the food infra- structure for a week, the general population wa s forced to live off of private food larders and had sufficient stores to see them th rough the emergency. However, a significant number of people, those with little or no ho me food supply, would have to begin looking for food immediately. Historically, even the United States’ vast agricultural we alth has not always been enough to protect its people from the effects of nature and bad economic decisions. Mil- lions of Americans knew hunger as a conseque nce of a drought that caused the dust bowl years (1935 to 1938) in the Western and Cent ral Plains breadbasket, as well as by the Wall Street crash of 1929 and the Great De pression. Even today, according to the USDA, 33.6 million Americans, almost 12 percent of the national population, live in “food-inse- cure households.” Food-insecure households , as defined by the USDA, are households that are uncertain of having or are unable to acquire enough food to meet the nutritional needs of all their members because they have insufficient money or other resources. A natural disaster or delibera te attack that makes food less available, or more expen- sive, would place at least America’s poor, 33.6 million people, at grave risk. They would have the least food stockpiled at home and be the first to need food supplies. A work force preoccupied with finding food would be unable to perf orm its normal jobs. Social order likely would decay if a food shortage were protract ed. A government that cannot supply the population with enough food to pres erve health and life could face anarchy. In the event of a crisis, often merely in th e event of bad weather, supermarket shelves are quickly stripped as some people begin to hoard food. Hoarding deprives government of the opportunity to ration lo cal food supplies to ensure th at all people are adequately fed in the event of a food shortage. The abi lity to promptly replenish supermarket food supplies becomes imperative in order to avoid mass hunger. Blackouts of the electric grid caused by stor ms or accidents have destroyed food sup- plies. An EMP attack that damages the power grid and denies electricity to warehouses or that directly damages refriger ation and temperature control sy stems could destroy most of"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 7. Food Infrastructure 135 the 30-day regional perishable food supply. Blackouts also ha ve disrupted transportation systems and impeded the replenishment of local food supplies. Federal, state, and local government agenci es combined sometimes have had difficulty compensating for food shortages caused by storm-induced blackouts. For example:  Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 caused a pr otracted blackout in New Orleans and the coastal region, destroying the food supply. Flooding, downed trees, and washed- out bridges paralyzed transpor tation. But the Katrina blackout by itself was sufficient to stop transportation and pr event rapid replenishment and repair of the food infra- structure because gas stations could not operate without electr ic power. An EMP attack could also paralyze transportation of food by rende ring gas pumps inoperable, causing vehicles to fail and bl acking out traffic lights, resul ting in massive traffic jams. Hurricane Katrina’s destructi on of the food supply was a ma jor contributing factor to the necessity of mass evacuation of New Orleans and the coastal population. Because many evacuees never returned, the protracted disruption of the f ood infrastructure, which lasted weeks—and in some localitie s months—while the el ectric power grid was being restored, was a major factor contributing to permanently reducing the populations of New Orleans and coastal Loui siana. Hurricane Katr ina’s effect on the food infrastructure is comparable to what can be expected from a small EMP attack.  Hurricane Lili in October 2002 bl acked out the power grid in coastal Louisiana, virtu- ally collapsing the local f ood infrastructure. As a consequence of the blackout, food was unavailable to thousands through normal means. In south Louisiana, 30 supermar- kets would not open because th e blackout prevented their el ectric cash registers from operating. Those stores that did open were stri pped of food within hours. In Abbeville, the parking lots of shopping centers became feeding stations run by churches and the state Office of Emergency Preparedness. A ssociated Grocers, which supplies food to supermarkets in Louisiana, Texas, and Missi ssippi, sent food in refrigerated trucks to the area from regional warehouses. The food emergency was reflected in a skyr ocketing demand for dry ice to preserve food stuffs during the hot weather and to pres erve refrigerated foods. Local supplies of dry ice were exhausted quickly—one st ore selling 20,000 pounds of dry ice to hun- dreds of customers in 2 hours—and had to be supplemented with supplies from the Red Cross. It is important to note that no one died from food or water deprivation during this emergency, and that the damaged area was sm all enough to be ai ded rapidly during recovery by undamaged fringe areas.  Hurricane Floyd in September 1999 put more than 200 supermarkets out of operation in North Carolina. Protracted blackouts cau sed massive food spoilage despite emer- gency efforts taken before the storm to pr eserve perishable goods in freezers. Floyd blackouts also impeded replenishment of so me supermarkets by inducing traffic signal failures that contributed to massive traffic jams.  An ice storm blacked out the Washington, D.C., area in January 1999. Warm food, potentially a survival issue in the freezing winter conditions, was not available in most people’s homes because electric ovens and microwaves no longer worked. In addition, most gas-powered ovens woul d not work because those built since the mid-1980s have electronic ignition and cannot be lit with a match. Some resorted to cooking on camp stoves. Preserving refrigerated foods was also a concern that Pepco,"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 7. Food Infrastructure 136 the regional power authority, helped a ddress by giving away 120,000 pounds of dry ice, all that it had. Dry ic e became a precious commodity.  In January 1998, an ice storm caused a widesp read blackout affecting parts of Ontario and Quebec in Canada, and Maine and upstate New York in the United States. The blackout threatened the food supply. Accord ing to press reports, “Food poisoning has become a real threat as embattled Montrealers, unable to get to stores, eat food that has been kept too long in refrig erators that no longer work.” In upstate New York, the electric utility Niagara Mohawk announced that it was focusing restoration of electric power on mo re populated areas “so that supermarkets, gasoline stations, and hotels could reopen, and people in the more rural areas could find food and shelter.” New York State Electric and Gas help ed customers get to shel- ters and distributed 200,000 pounds of dry ice for preserving food.  Hurricane Andrew in August 1992 laid waste to 165 square miles in South Florida and left 3.3 million homes and businesses without electricity. Andrew’s aftermath posed an immediate threat to life in S outh Florida, in part because of damage to the food infra- structure. Most grocery stor es had been destroyed. Massive traffic jams, caused in part by nonfunctioning signal and street lights, pre- vented the surviving supermarkets from being resupplied. “More than 5,000 traffic lights are on the blink,” th e press reported. “Traffic was snarled for miles. The sim- plest chore, indeed almost everyt hing, seemed to take forever.” To meet the crisis, tons of surplus food were distributed in the ar ea. Nonetheless, two weeks after the hurricane, food wa s still not reaching many victims. Andrew’s blackout of the power grid made the crisis over food, water, and shelter worse by severing communica tions between relief work ers and victims. Without power, there was an almost complete co llapse of communicat ions—no telephones, radio, or television. Consequently, many peopl e were unaware of relief efforts or of where to go for help. Had Hurricane Andrew damaged a larger area, it is likely that undamaged fringe areas would have been less capable of coming to the rescue, result- ing in a significant loss of life. Storm-induced blackouts provide some basis for extrapolating the greater destructive effects on food infrastructure likely from an EMP attack. An EMP attack is likely to damage electric power grids and other system s over a much wider geographic area than blackouts caused by storms; theref ore, recovery from an EMP attack probably would take longer. An EMP attack also could directly damage some electronic systems, including refrigeration systems and vehicles, which normally would not be damaged by a blackout. Compared to blackouts, an EMP attack could inflict damage over a wider geographic area and damage a much wider array of equipmen t; consequently, recovery of the food infra- structure from EMP is likely to be much more complicated and more protracted. Federal, state, and local agencies combined would find it difficult to cope immediately or even over a protracted peri od of days or weeks following an EMP attack that causes the food infrastructure to fail across a broad geographic area encompassing one or more states. Infrastructure failure at the level of food distributio n because of disruption of the transportation system, as is likely during an EMP attack, could bring on food shortages affecting the general populati on in as little as 24 hours."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 7. Food Infrastructure 137 Massive traffic jams are most likely in larg e cities, the very areas where rapid replen- ishment of the food supply at hundreds of supe rmarkets will be needed most urgently. Significantly, recent famines in the developing world have occurred, despite massive relief efforts by the international community, in large part because food relief could not reach victim populations thr ough their underdeveloped transportation infrastructure. An EMP attack could, in effect, temporarily crea te in the United St ates the technological conditions in the food and transportation infras tructures that have re sulted in developing world famines. Recommendations Current planning, as reflected in the President’s Nationa l Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Ke y Assets, the Public Health, Security, and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (the Bioterrorism Act), and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) planning documents, all appear to assume relatively small-scale threats to the food infr astructure. Most concern is focused on ter- rorists’ poisoning or infecting a small portion of the food su pply to cause mass panic and public fear about the safety of all food. The FEMA Federa l Response Plan for a food shortage assumes a disaster effecting about 10,000 people: “On the fringes of the geo- graphic areas affected will be schools and small institutions having large inventories estimated to be sufficient to feed up to 10,000 people for 3 days and supply their fluid needs for 1 day.” 1 Yet an EMP attack could so damage the food infrastructure that mil- lions of people would be at risk. Recommen dations to address this risk include the following:  Relevant federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security and the USDA, should supplement their plans to m eet food emergencies by drawing on federal food stockpiles.  Federal food stockpiles should be sized to m eet a possible large-scale food shortage in the event of massive disruption of the nationa l food infrastructure from an EMP attack or other causes.  The Federal Government should examine usef ul lessons learned from reviewing ear- lier plans and programs, such as those during the early Cold War years, when the Fed- eral Government planned and prepared for food shortages on a large scale.  The Federal Government should plan to locate, preserve, de liver, distribute, and ration existing stockpiles of processed and unpro cessed food, including f ood stockpiles by the USDA and other government agencies, wh ich will be an important component of maintaining the food supply.  The Federal Government should make it a pr iority to plan to protect, deliver, and ration food from regional warehouses, under conditions in which an EMP attack has disrupted the power, transpor tation, and other infrastructu res for a protracted period.  The Federal Government should make plans to process and deliver private and govern- ment grain stockpiles to significantly supplem ent the processed food stored in regional warehouses. According to the USDA’s National Agricultural Statistical Service, total private grain stockpiles in the United States amount to more than 255 million metric tons.

Presidential initiatives have designated th e Department of Homeland Security as the lead agency responsible for the security of the food infrastructure, overseeing and work- ing with the USDA.

In some particularly dire emergencies, as during Hurricane Ka trina and Hurricane Andrew, when private sector food resources we re destroyed or inadequate to meet the crisis, the Federal Government has resorted to federal surplus foods. Many Andrew vic- tims were saved from hunger by Meals Ready to Eat (MRE). But the Federal Govern- ment was surprised by Andrew, and the resort to MREs and surplus food stockpiles was a poorly planned act of desper ation that came late in th e crisis. Recommendations to achieve this initiative include the following:  The Federal Government should consider one readily available option, which is to grow the food stockpile to include the MREs.  Plans should include timely distribution of mass quantities of f ood, which is likely to be crucial during a shortage.  The Stafford Act should be amended to provide for pl ans to locate, protect, and distrib- ute existing private and government stockpile s of food and to provide plans for dis- tributing existing food stockpi les to the general population in the event of a national emergency.   2 Appendix B, Robert T.

W W a a t t e e r r I I n n f f r r a a s s t t r r u u c c t t u u r r e e Introduction Water and its system of supply is a vital infrastructure. High-altitude electromagnetic pulse (EMP) can damage or disrupt the in frastructure that supplies water to the population, agriculture, and industry of the United States (U.S.). The water infrastructure depends for its oper ation on electricity. To the extent possible, aqueducts, tunnels, pipelines, and other water delivery systems are designed to rely on gravity. However, since the invention and pro liferation of the elec tric water pump early in the last century, urban growth, planning, and architecture have been liberated from dependence on gravity-fed water systems. By making water move uphill, the gravity pump has made possible the construction and gr owth of cities and towns in locations that, in previous centuries, would have been impo ssible. Skyscrapers and high-rise buildings, which would be impractical if dependent on a gravity-fed water syst em, have been made possible by the electric pump. Electrically driven pumps, valves, filters, and a wide variety of othe r electrical machin- ery are indispensable for the purification of water for drin king and industrial purposes and for delivering water to consumers. An EMP attack could degrade or damage these systems, affecting the delivery of wate r to a very large geographic region. Electrical machinery is also indispensable to the removal and treatment of wastewater. An EMP attack that degraded the processe s for removing and treating wastewater could quickly cause public health problems over a wide area. Supervisory and Control Data Acquisition Systems (SCADA) ar e critical to the running and management of the infrastructure for delivery of pure water for drinking, for indus- try, and for the removal and treatment of wa stewater. SCADAs enable centralized control and diagnostics of system problems and fail ures and have made possible the regulation and repair of the water infrastructure with a small fraction of the work force required in earlier days. As discussed in greater detail in Chapter 1, an EMP attack could damage or destroy SCADAs, making it difficult to manage the water infrastructu re and to identify and diagnose system problems and overwhelmi ng the small work force with systemwide electrical failures. The electric power grid provides the energy th at runs the water infrastructure. An EMP attack that disrupts or collapses the power gr id would disrupt or st op the operation of the SCADAs and electrical machinery in the wate r infrastructure. Some water systems have emergency power generators, which could pr ovide continued — albeit greatly reduced — water supply and wastewater operations for a short time. Little analysis has been conducted of the potential vulnerability of the water infra- structure to EMP attack. However, SCADAs supporting the water infrastructure are known not to have been hardened, or in most cases even tested, against the effects of an EMP attack. The electric power grid, on which the water in frastructure is crit ically dependent, is known to be vulnerable to feasible levels of EMP. Moreover, blackouts of the power grid induced by storms and mechanical failures ar e known to have disrupted the water infra- structure on numerous occasions. These st orm- and accident-induced blackouts of the power grid are not likely to be as severe or as geogra phically widespread in their conse- quences for the water infrastructure as would an EMP attack."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 8. Water Infrastructure 140 Federal, state, and local emergency services , faced with the failure of the water infra- structure in a single large city, would be hard pressed to provide the population with the minimum water requirements necessary to sustain life over a time frame longer than a few days. They could not provide, on an exte nded emergency basis, the water require- ments and services, including waste removal, necessary to sustain normal habitation and industrial production in a single large city; however, an EM P attack could disrupt the water infrastructure over a large geogra phic area encompassing many cities for a pro- tracted period of weeks or even months. The Water Works Water for consumption and san itation is taken for granted by virtually everyone in the United States. Yet, the infrastructure for supplying pure water to the U.S. population and industry and for removing and tr eating wastewater, compared to other infrastructures, took longer to build and arguably is the most important of all infras tructures for the sus- tainment of human life. One of the most important differences be tween developed and underdeveloped nations is the availability of pure water. An estimat ed 1.3 billion people in the developing world, nearly one-quarter of the global population, l ack access to safe drinking water and even more, approximately 1.8 billion, lack water for sanitation. Consequently, diseases related to impure water flourish in many underdevelop ed nations, taking a devastating toll on health and longevity. Economic developmen t in many developing world nations is impeded by the absence of an adequate water supply to support industr y. Indeed, in some countries, a major obstacle to development is simply the fact that the labor force has no alternative but to spend much of its time transporting water for drinking and other domestic uses from distant and often contaminated sources. In contrast to the water scarcity that impe des development in much of the developing world, the United States enjoys a healt hy and growing population and economic pros- perity supported by the efficient distribut ion and utilization of its abundant water resources. Freshwater consumption for a ll purposes averages about 1,300 gallons per capita per day in the United States. Irrigation and cooling account fo r about 80 percent of all consumption, and, in the 17 western states, irrigation alone accounts for more than 80 percent of water consumption. On average, some 100 gallons per person per day (200 gallons per person per day in the southwest) are consumed for domestic purposes such as drinking, bathing, preparing f ood, washing clothes and dishes, flushing toilets, washing cars, and watering lawns and gardens. Drinking and cooking account for only a sma ll fraction of the water consumed; how- ever, because in most cases a single water source must serve all purposes, all water con- sumed, regardless of the purpose, must meet the standards for drinking water purity, as prescribed by law. Supporting this demand for enormous quantitie s of high-quality water is a vast infra- structure that includes more than 75,000 dams and reservoirs; thousands of miles of pipes, aqueducts, and water distribution a nd sewer lines; l68,000 drinking water treatment facilities; and 19,500 wastewater treatment facilities. A fairly small number of large drinking water and wastewater utilities located primarily in urban areas (about 15 percen t of the systems) provide water services to more than 75 percent of the U.S. population."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 8. Water Infrastructure 141 There is no single organization or system c ontrolling the entire water infrastructure of the United States. Rather, more than 100,000 u tilities and private owners manage the national water infrastructure. However, because water utilities provide similar services and must meet similar standards, they all operate in much the same way. Water supplies require collection, treatment , storage, and distribution. Surface water such as reservoirs, lakes, and rivers gene rally provides water for cities. Wells tapping underground aquifers often supply rural areas and the southwestern states. Homeowners with private wells typically drink the wate r directly, because the subsurface water has been filtered over many years within th e natural underground sedimentation. Water treatment plants are designed to provide an uninterrupted water supply that raises the purity of surface water and aquifers to dri nking standards. A t ypical municipal water treatment plant purifies water through several steps: f iltration, coagulat ion, flocculation, sedimentation, and disinfection. Filtration by utilities passes raw water first through coarse filters to remove sticks, leaves, and other large debris. Finer filtra tion passes water through layers of sand and other granular material to remove silt and microorganisms. This stage of treatment imi- tates the natural filtration of water as it moves through the ground. This entire process is accomplished through low-lift pumps and mech anically cleaned bar screens and fine screens. Coagulation is the process of removing colloidal impurities, finely suspended particles, from the filtered water. A coagulant, such as aluminum sulfate, is thoroughly mixed into water containing colloidal particles. Alum inum sulfate not only will coagulate and remove colloidal particles, but also will reac t with calcium hydroxide in the water, form- ing aluminum hydroxide, which can be removed through further filtration or sedimentation. Flocculation immediately follows the coagulatio n process to remove the finest particles that would never settle out na turally. The velocity of the wa ter is reduced and a gentle mixing action is used to allow formation of in soluble salts, colloidal particles, and other remaining suspended matter into a “floc” par ticle. The colloids a nd the coagulants mix with each other to form a large neutral fl oc particle that will settle out during sedimentation. Sedimentation involves moving the water to large tanks to allow the floc to settle to the bottom of the tank. Sedimentation basins or clar ifiers are usually the largest tanks in the treatment process. About 1 pound of sludge is created for every pound of chemical added to the water for coagulation and flocculati on. The sludge must be removed and disposed of and filters and screens must be backwashed regularly. Disinfection uses chemicals to kill any micr oorganisms that may have survived the fil- tration process. Chlorine is the most common disinfectant. When chlorine combines with organic material, such as dead leaves, it produces potentially dangerous trihalomethanes (THM). Large water treatment plants in major cities often undertake an additional purifi- cation step that reduces the level of THMs. Ozone oxidation and ultraviolet light are other disinfectant processes that are sometimes used instead of or in addition to chlorine. Fluoride also may be added because of its ab ility to retard tooth decay. Groundwater is often aerated by bubbling air through the wate r or by spraying to oxidize dissolved iron and manganese and to remove odors caused by hydrogen sulfide."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 8. Water Infrastructure 142 Treated water is delivered by high-lift pum ps to the distribution system, usually through pipelines pressurized to 40 to 80 psi, to consumers. These pumps help to main- tain water levels in storage reservoirs. Gravity flow, whenever possible, is the preferred method for delivering water. However, most wa ter must be delivered by means of electric pumps. High-pressure pumps at the treatment plant deliver water to various zones within a water district to a booster pump or series of booster pumps that completes delivery to the consumer. High-rise buildings typically are serviced by individual booster pumps with enough pressure to provi de water to rooftop reservoi rs for consumption by upper floors and to provide water for firefighting. Many of the same processes us ed in purification of drinki ng water also are used in treatment of wastewater, suitably modified for the removal of the greater amounts of material found in sewage. Sewage provides an ideal environment for a vast array of microbes, primarily bacteria, plus some viru ses and protozoa. In fact, wastewater proc- essing relies on benign microorganisms in th e purification process. Sewage may also contain pathogens from the excreta of people w ith infectious diseases that can be trans- mitted by contaminated water. Waterborne diseases, while seldom a problem now in developed nations, are still a threat in deve loping countries where treated water is not available for public use. Contaminants are generally removed from wastewater physica lly, biologically, and chemically. First, rags, sticks, and large soli ds are removed by coarse screens to protect the pumps. Then grit, the material that wears out equipment, is settled out in grit tanks or chambers. At this point, most of the sma ll solids are still in suspension and can be removed and concentrated in the primary grav ity settling tanks. The concentrated solids, called raw sludge, are pumped to an anaerobic digester for biologi cal decomposition. The clarified effluent then flows to secondary treatment units for biol ogical oxidation where the dissolved and colloidal matter in wastewat er provides nutrient s for microorganisms. A final gravity settling tank is used to rem ove microorganisms. This concentrated bio- logical sludge is removed and returned to the anaerobic digester. Chemical disinfection, usually employing chlorine, is the last stage in the treatment of wast ewater before it is discharged. Vulnerability to EMP The water infrastructure is a vast machine, powered partly by gravity but mostly by electricity. Electrically driven pumps, valves, filters, and a wi de variety of other machin- ery and control mechanisms purify and deliv er water to consumers and remove waste- water. An EMP attack could damage or dest roy these systems, cutting off the water sup- ply or poisoning the water s upply with chemicals and path ogens from wastewater. For example:  Total organic carbon (TOC) analyzers detect th e levels of pollutants and pathogens in water. Determining water quality and the kind of purification treatment necessary depends on these sensors.  Mechanical screens, filters, collector chai ns, skimmers, and backwash systems remove sludge and other solid wastes. Failure of these systems would pollute the water and quickly clog the pumps.  SCADA systems enable remote control and in stantaneous correction of potential prob- lems with water quality, delivery, and wastewater removal and treatment. This process allows most water utilities to be nearly autonomous in operation, using a minimum"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 8. Water Infrastructure 143 number of personnel. In an emergency, such as an electrical blackout, some subsys- tems have been or could easily be modi fied for workarounds. For example, many valves have a manual bypass mode, and some water plants have emergency power generators. However, the efficiencies made possible by SCADAs have reduced the available number of trained personnel pr obably below the levels required for protracted manual operation of water treatme nt facilities. The failure of SCADAs would greatly impede all operations.  High-lift and low-lift pumps are ubiquitous throughout the in frastructure for purifying and delivering water and removing wastewater . Water cannot be purified or delivered, nor sewage removed and treated, if thes e systems are damaged or destroyed.  Paddle flocculators and other types of mixers are the pr imary means of chlorination and other chemical purification. If these systems cease functioning, water cannot be purified and likely would remain hazardous. All of these systems depend on the electric gr id for power. Large water treatment plants consume so much electricity, in some cases about 100 megawatts, that backup generators are impractical. For reliability, water treatment plants typically draw electricity from two local power plants. An EMP attack that coll apses the electric power grid will also col- lapse the water infrastructure. Consequences of Water Infrastructure Failure By disrupting the water infrastructure, an EMP attack could pose a major threat to life, industrial activity, and social order. Denial of water can cause death in 3 to 4 days, depending on the climate and level of activity. Stores typically stock enough consumable li quids to supply the normal demands of the local population for 1 to 3 days, although th e demand for water and other consumable liquids would greatly increase if tap water we re no longer available. Local water supplies would quickly disappear. Resupplying local stor es with water would be difficult in the aftermath of an EMP attack that disrupts tr ansportation systems, a likely condition if all critical infrastructures were disrupted. People are likely to resort to drinking from lakes, streams, ponds, and other sources of surface water. Most surface water, especially in urban areas, is contaminated with wastes and pathogens and could cause serious illness if consumed. If water treatment and sewage plants cease operating, the concen tration of wastes in surface water will certainly increase dramatically and make the risks of c onsuming surface water more hazardous. One possible consequence of the failure of wa ter treatment and sewage plants could be the release of sludge and othe r concentrated wastes and pa thogens. Typical industrial wastes include cyanide, arsenic, mercury, cadmium, and other toxic chemicals. Boiling water for purification would be difficult in the absence of electricity. Even most modern gas stoves require electricity for ign ition and cannot be lighted by match. In any event, gas also may not be available to li ght the stoves (see Chapte r 5). Boiling could be accomplished by open fires, fueled by wood or other flammables. Other possible mitiga- tors are hand-held pump filters, water purification kits, iodine tablets, or a few drops of household bleach. A prolonged water shortage may quickly lead to serious consequences. People preoccupied with finding or producing enough drinking water to sustain life would be unavailable to work at normal jobs. Most i ndustrial processes require large quantities of water and would cease if the water infrastructure were to fail."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 8. Water Infrastructure 144 Demoralization and deterioration of social or der can be expected to deepen if a water shortage is protracted. An archy will certainly loom if government cannot supply the population with enough water to preserve health and life. The many homeowners with private wells al so would face similar problems. There would be fewer workarounds to get their pumps operating again, if the pump controller is damaged or inoperable. Even if power is re stored, it is unlikely the average homeowner would be technically competent to bypass a fa iled pump controller and figure out how to power the pump with bypass power lines. The first priority would be meeting persona l water needs. Federal, state, and local governments do not have the coll ective capability, if the water infrastructure fails over a large area, to supply enough water to the civilian population to preserve life. Storm-induced blackouts of the el ectric grid have demonstrat ed that, in the absence of electric power, the water infrastructure will fail. Storm-induced blac kouts have also dem- onstrated that, even in the face of merely lo cal and small-scale failure of the water infra- structure, the combined efforts of government agencies at all levels are hard pressed to help. For example:  Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 collapsed the water infras tructure in New Orleans and coastal Louisiana. The Katrina-induced blackout stopped the vast machinery for purifying and delivering water to the population. Water su pplies were contaminated. The National Guard, among other resources, ha d to be mobilized to rush water and mobile water purification systems to the afflicted region. The water crisis—which was protracted because the blackout was protra cted, the electric power grid requiring weeks and in some places months to repair —was a major contributing factor to the mass evacuation of the regional populat ion. Once evacuated, ma ny never returned. Thus the loss of water resources was a signi ficant factor contri buting to permanently reducing the population in the region. The e ffects of Hurricane Katrina on the water infrastructure are comparable to what can be expected from a small EMP attack.  Hurricane Lili in October 2002 blacked out the power grid in coastal Louisiana. With no electricity, water pumps no longer work ed, depriving the population of running water. Local bottled water supplies were quick ly exhausted. Federal and state authori- ties resorted to using roadside parking lo ts and tanker trucks as water distribution centers.  In September 1999, Hurricane Floyd blacked out electricity, causing water treatment and sewage plants to fail in some Virginia localities and, most not ably, in Baltimore, Maryland. For several days, blackout-induced failure of Baltimore’s Hampden sewage facility raised concerns about public hea lth. With its three pumps inoperable, Hamp- den spilled 24 million gallons of waste into Baltimore’s Jones Falls waterway and the Inner Harbor.  An ice storm in January 1999 blacked out Canada’s Ontario and Quebec provinces, causing an immediate and life- threatening emergency in Montreal’s water supply, which depends on electricity for filtration and pumping. On January 9, the two water treatment plants that served 1.5 million pe ople in the Montreal region failed, leaving the area with only enough water to last 4 to 8 hours. Government officials kept the water crisis secret, feari ng public knowledge would exacerbate the crisis by water hoarding and panic. But as household water pipes went dry and reports of a water shortage spread, hoarding happened anyway and bottled water disappeared from"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 8. Water Infrastructure 145 stores. Warnings not to drink water wit hout boiling it proved pointless, because people had no other way of getting water and no way to boil it in the mid-winter blackout. Montreal officials feared not on ly a shortage of drinking wa ter, but also an inadequate supply of water for fighting fires. The Montreal fire department prepared to fight fires with a demolition crane instead of water, hoping that, if a building caught fire, the con- flagration might be contained by demolishi ng surrounding structures. So desperate was the situation that provincial officials c onsidered evacuating the city. Fortunately, Hydro-Quebec, the government’s electric util ity, managed to restore power to the fil- tration plants and restore water service before such extreme measures became necessary.  In August 1996, a heat wave blacked out pa rts of the southwestern United States. Water supplies were interrupted in some regions because electric pumps would not work. Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Nevada , Texas, and Idaho experienced black- out-induced disruption in water service during the heat wave . In Fresno, where most of the city received water from wells power ed by electric pumps, the city manager declared a local emergency. Only two of the city’s 16 fire stations had water, and most of the fire hydrants were dr y. Tankers were rushed in to supplement the fire department’s water supply.  Hurricane Andrew in August 1992 caused a blackout in S outh Florida that stopped water pumps from working. The blackout de nied running water to hundreds of thou- sands of people stranded among the ruins le ft by Andrew, amidst Florida’s summer heat. To meet the immediate crisis mo re than 200,000 gallons of water were distributed. However, without electricity to power radio or television sets, mass communication virtually ceased to exist, and people were unaware of relief efforts or where to seek help. Thousands may have b een saved from dehydration by pyramids of bottled water on street corners made free for the taking and by survivors who spread the word. In all the examples cited, timely emergency se rvices to provide water prevented loss of life from dehydration. However, had the outages lasted longer and the blacked-out areas been larger, the outcome could have been very different. Storms are merely suggestive of, and provide some basis for extrapolating, the greater destruc tive effects on water infrastructure likely from an EMP attack. Storm-induced blackouts and their effects on the water infrastructure are an imperfect analogy to EMP attack. Taken at face value, storm-induced blackouts and their conse- quences for the water infrastructure grossly unde rstate the threat posed by an EMP attack. Storms are much more limited in geographic scope compared to an EMP attack. Power grid and water infrastructure recovery from storms, compared to recovery from an EMP attack, is likely to happen more quickly becau se of the “edge effect”—the capability of neighboring localities and states to provide re covery assistance. Because an EMP attack is likely to damage or disrupt electronics over a much wider geographic area than storm- induced blackouts, rescuers from neighbori ng states and localitie s would face a much bigger job, and recovery of the water infras tructure would take a much longer time. Nor do storm-induced blackouts replicate the damage from an EMP attack that may occur in small-scale electronic systems criti cal to the operation of the water infrastruc- ture, such as electric pumps, SCADAs, and motor controls for filters and valves. Com- pared to storms, an EMP attack is likely to inflict not only more widespread damage geo-"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 8.

Recommendations A Presidential Directive establishes new na tional policy for protec tion of our nation’s critical infrastructures against terrorist threat s that could cause catastrophic health effects. National-level responsibilities ha ve already been assigned to the Department of Home- land Security (DHS) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to protect the water infrastructure from terrorist threats. The EPA is the designated lead agency for protection of drinking water and water treat ment systems. Under this directive:  DHS and EPA should ensure that protec tion includes EMP attack among the recog- nized threats to the water infrastructure.  The following initiatives should be amended: — The President’s National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Crit ical Infrastruc- tures and Key Assets (February 2003), which details a plan for protecting the United States’ critical infrastructures, including the infrastructure for water. The Presi- dent’s plan: h Identifies threats to the water infrastructure as: “Physical damage or destruction of critical assets...actual or threatened contaminati on of the water supply...cyber attack on information management syst ems...interruption of services from another infrastructure.” h Directs the EPA to work with the DHS, state and local governments, and the water sector industry to: “Identify high-pr iority vulnerabilities and improve site security...improve sector monitoring a nd analytic capabilities...improve sector- wide information exchange and coordi nate contingency planning...work with other sectors to manage unique risks resulting from interdependencies.” h Focuses on terrorism and threats other than EMP, but lends itself well (in particular, its structure and logic) to addressing any threat, and should be amended to include EMP. — The Public Health and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (Bioterrorism Act) , signed into law by President Bush on June 12, 2002. The Bioter- rorism Act: h Requires the authorities over many dri nking water systems to conduct vulnerabil- ity assessments, certify and submit copies of their assessments to the EPA, and prepare or revise their emergency response plans. h Is concerned with terrorist contamination of drinking water with chemical or bio- logical agents. h Could be amended to address the greater bi o-chemical threat that an EMP attack potentially poses to the water supply th an any of the threats envisioned in the Bioterrorism Act because an EMP attack that causes SCADAs in water treatment facilities to malfunction could release bi ochemical agents, and conceivably con- taminate water supplies ove r a very wide region.  DHS and EPA should follow the governme nt-recommended emergency preparedness steps applicable to a wide range of civil emergencies arising from different threats. These steps include assuring availability of water during emergencies. To that end, the government has recommended that citizens st ockpile both water supplies and means of purification. Implementing these recommendations will provide some measure of preparation for an EMP threat to the water supply."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 9.

E E m m e e r r g g e e n n c c y y S S e e r r v v i i c c e e s s Introduction Emergency services are essential to the pres ervation of law and order, maintenance of public health and safety, and protection of property. Americans have come to rely on prompt and effective delivery of fire, police, rescue, and emergency medical services through local government sys- tems. Backing up these local systems are stat e capabilities (e.g., st ate police and National Guard) and specialized capabilities such as those provided by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Justice, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other federal entities. The demand for emergency services is large. Across the United States more than 200 million 9-1-1 calls are fielded annually. 1 Responding to these calls is an army of some 600,000 local law enforcement officers, 1 million firefighters, and more than 170,000 emergency medical technicians and paramedics. 2 Anticipated expenditures over the next 5 years for emergency response services are es timated at $26 billion to $76 billion at the state and local levels, supplemented by an additional $27 billion at the federal level. 3 Emergency services at all leve ls are receiving increased em phasis as a consequence of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Th e focus is on preventing and responding to terrorism, including nu clear attack, but little emergency serv ices planning spe- cifically considers electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack. The primary focus in this chapter is on local emergency services systems. In particular, this chapter focuses on the communications syst ems to alert, dispatch, and monitor those emergency services. The great majority of reso urces are concentrated at the local level; state and federal assistance will likely be quite thin, given the large geographic extent of an EMP attack. In addition to local emergency systems, we also address the federal Emergency Alert System (EAS), designed to serve the Presid ent and other leaders in communicating with the public in emergency situations. Although no President has ever used the EAS, it is reasonable to anticipate that it would be used in the event of an EMP attack.

The Emergency Alert System The original motivation for the EAS (previ ously the Emergency Broadcast System and initially Control of Electromagnetic Radia tion [CONELRAD]) was to provide the Presi- dent the ability to communicate directly with the American people in time of crisis, espe- cially enemy attack. Although it has never been used for that purpose, it has been acti- vated in local emergencies and is widely us ed for weather alerts. The Federal Communi- cations Commission (FCC) sets requirements through regulation of television and radio stations. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), now part of DHS, pro- vides administrative oversight. In the case of a national emergency, a message is relayed from the President or his agent to high-power amplitude modulation (AM) radio stations, known as national pri- mary stations, across the country. These stati ons broadcast signals to other AM and fre- quency modulation (FM) radio stations, weathe r radio channels, and television stations that, in turn, relay the message to still othe r stations, including cab le television stations. These stations use encoders and decoders to send and receive data recognized as emer- gency messages. Impact of an EMP Attack In a crisis, the priorities for emergency serv ices are protection of lives, protection of property, effective communication with the pub lic, maintenance of an operational EOC, effective communication among emergency worker s, and rapid restoration of lost infra- structure capabilities. An EMP attack will adversely affect emergency services’ ability to accomplish these objectives in two distinct ways: by increasing the demand for services and by decreasing the ability to deliver them. Demand for Emergency Services The demand for emergency services will almost certainly increase dramati- cally in the aftermath of an EMP attack. These demands fall into two broad cate- gories: information and assistance. The absence of timely information and the inabil ity of recovery actions to meet the demand for emergency services will have grave consequences. Large-scale natural and technol ogical disasters that have occurred in the last several decades demonstrate that information demands are among the first priorities of disaster victims. At the onset of a disaster, an indivi dual is concerned primarily with his or her personal well-being and that of close family members and friends. The next most press- ing concern is for information regarding the event itself. What happened? How extensive is the damage? Who was responsible? Is the at tack over? A less immediate priority is for   The demand for emergency services will almost certainly increase dramatically in the aftermath of an EMP attack. "},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 9. Emergency Services 150 information regarding recovery. How long will it take to restore essential services? What can and should I do for self-preservation and to contribute to recovery ? It is important to recognize that emergency services providers also need al l this information, for the same reasons as everyone else and al so to manage rec overy operations efficiently and perform their missions. Information assurance for em ergency services requires reliable communi- cations supporting the transport of emergency se rvices such as enhanced 9-1-1 (E9-1-1). 4 As discussed in Chapter 3, Telecommunications: Based upon results of the Commission-spons ored analysis, an EMP attack would disrupt or damage a functionally significan t fraction of the electronic circuits in the Nation’s civilian telecommunications sy stems in the region exposed to EMP. The remaining operational networks woul d be subjected to high levels of call attempts for some period of time after th e attack, leading to degraded telecommu- nications services. To meet the demand for priority national se curity and emergency preparedness (NS/EP) services supporting first responders, the FCC and the DHS’s Na tional Communications System (NCS) offer a wide range of NS/EP communications services that support quali- fying federal, state, and lo cal government, industry, and nonp rofit organization personnel in performing their NS/EP mi ssions, including E9-1-1 PSAPs. 5,6 The demand for assistance will increase grea tly in the event of an EMP attack. The pos- sibility of fires caused by electrical arcing resulting from an EMP attack cannot be ruled out. There is no reliable methodol ogy to predict the frequency of such fires. As with other EMP effects, however, they will occur near-sim ultaneously, so that even a small number could overwhelm local fire departments’ abil ity to respond. Fires indirectly caused by an EMP attack, principally because of people be ing careless with candles used for emer- gency lighting or with alternative heating sources during power blackouts, are also a concern. There also exists the possibility of EMP-caused airplane crashes. 7 The average daily peak of air traffic in U.S. airspace incl udes more than 6,000 commercial aircraft carrying some 300,000 passengers and crew . Commercial airc raft are protecte d against lightning strikes but not specifically against EMP. The frequency composition of lightning and EMP differ enough so that lightni ng protection does not ensu re EMP protection. On the other hand, the margins of safety for lightni ng protection imposed on commercial aircraft may provide flight safety in the event of an EMP attack. In any even t, we cannot rule out the possibility of airplane crashes. Debilitating EMP effects on the air traffic control system will al so be a contributing factor to airplane crashes. Emergency rescue services can be expected to experience an increase in demand. Peo- ple trapped on subways and in elevators will require timely rescue. If electric power is interrupted for any period of time, people at home who depend on oxygen concentrators, respirators, aspirators, and other life-sustaining equipment that require electric power will need to find alternative solutions quickl y. Home backup systems, including oxygen tanks, liquid oxygen supplies, and battery and gene rator power, will lessen the need for an   4 E9-1-1 provides emergency services personnel with geographic locati on information on mobile callers. 5 PSAP Enrollment in the TSP Program, h ttp://www.nasna911.org/pdf/tsp-enroll-guide.pdf . 6 National Communication System, http://www.ncs.gov/services.html . 7 See also Chapter 6, Transportation Infrastructure."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 9. Emergency Services 151 immediate response for those fortunate enough to have them, but eventually all these people will need to be transported to facilities with a reliable power sour ce and appropri- ate equipment. If power is out for more th an several days, people dependent on dialysis machines, nebulizers, and other life-supportin g medical devices also will be at risk. Finally, inability to replenish home supplies of medicines will eventually lead still more people to depend on emergency services. Police services will be stretched extremely th in because of a combination of factors. Police will be called on to assist rescue wo rkers in removing people from immediate dan- gers. Failures of automobiles and traffic cont rol systems with attendant massive traffic jams will generate demands for police serv ices for traffic management. Antisocial behavior also can occur following a chaotic event. Though it is more commonly seen in disasters originating from conflict, such as riots, than from natural or technological dis- asters, opportunistic crime (because of failures of electronic security devices, for exam- ple) is a potential reaction to an EMP attack. While not as prevalent as may be perceived, far worse antisocial behavior such as looting also could occur, especially in communities that experience conflict because of shortages or in areas that experience high crime rates under nondisaster circumstances. If looting or other forms of civi l disorder break out, it is likely that local police services will be overwhelmed. In that event, deployment of National Guard forces, imposition of curfews, and other more drastic measures may be necessary. Although emergency services could be completely overwhelmed in the aftermath of an EMP attack, it is important to rec- ognize that the demand for emergency services could be ameliorated somewhat by citizen groups that frequently emerge in the aftermath of disasters to lead or assist in recovery efforts. In the absence or failure of government-provided emergency services, these groups may take on roles similar to th ose services, for example, by moving and providing basic household necessities to families in need, clearing debris, or serving as an impromptu communications network. This exam ple of prosocial behavior is not uncom- mon in the aftermath of natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, or earthquakes. This was seen following the September 11, 2001, terro rist attacks, when thousands of New York citizens volunteered to give blood, help firefighters and police at the World Trade Center grounds, and assist in other ways. On the other hand, when the failure of police and emergency services becomes pro- tracted, the lawless element of society may emerge. For example, Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 damaged cell phone towers and radi o antennas that were crucial to the operation of emergency communications. Protract ed blackout of the power grid caused generators supporting emergenc y communications to exhaust their fuel supplies or fail from overuse. Consequently, government, police, and emergency services were severely impacted in their abili ty to communicate with the public and with each ot her. Looting, violence, and other criminal act ivities were serious problems in the aftermath of Katrina. In one instance, the Danziger Bridge incident 8 , members of a repair crew came under fire. Police called to the scene returned fire, and a number of people were killed.

Emergency Services 152 attack is likely to incapacitate the same nodes—cell phone towers and radio antennas— and overtax generators supporting emergency communications for a protracted period, creating the same conditions that incited lawl ess behavior in the aftermath of Katrina. EMP Effects on Emergency Services Some equipment needed to perform emergency services will be temporarily upset or directly damaged by an EMP attack, resulting in diminished capabili- ties during the time of greatest demand. Little, if any, emergency services equipment has been hardened spec ifically against EMP and thus may be vulnerable. On one hand, both communications equipment and vehicles commonly employed in the emergency services infrastructure generally have been designed to cope with the in creasingly dense everyday elect romagnetic environment from radio, television, wireless communications, rada r, and other man-made sources. On the other hand, emergency services rely on radios to transmit and receive voice and message traffic using many frequencies, including the same frequencies contained in EMP radia- tion fields. Whether or not this results in de gradation depends on the effectiveness of any built-in protection devices in th ese radios as well as the in ternal robustne ss of the radio itself. To gauge the degree of vulnerability of em ergency services to EMP, the Commission conducted an assessment of emergency servi ces equipment and associated networks. 9 We tested a representative variety of key el ectronics-based equipment needed by national leadership, first responders, and the genera l population. In most cases, only one of each model was tested, so statistical inferences ar e not possible from our test data. Moreover, a more robust assessment would test equipment under a range of conditions (such as differ- ent orientations, equipment ope rating modes, and test waveforms). Thus, our assessment should be viewed as indicative, rather than definitive. No twithstanding these caveats, these tests are the most comprehensive recent vulnerability tests of emergency services equipment to date. Our testing concentrated on items that were found to be critical for local emergency services and the EAS. The testing used sta ndard EMP test practices, including radiated pulse and direct current inj ection test methods. Large-scal e and smaller radiated pulse simulators were used to illuminate the e quipment with an approxi mation of the electro- magnetic field generated by an actual EMP ev ent. A second test method, known as pulse current injection, accounted for the stresses coup led to long lines such as power feeds that cannot be accurately tested in a radiated simulator. We also used the results of relevant past EMP testing efforts. P P u u b b l l i i c c S S a a f f e e t t y y A A n n s s w w e e r r i i n n g g P P o o i i n n t t s s . . The key elements of a PSAP include commercial tele- phone links for incoming 9-1-1 calls, computer -aided dispatch, public safety radio, and mobile data communications. There are other el ements associated with PSAPs, but this is the minimal set necessary to provide emergency response to the public. Computers are essential to normal PSAP ope rations. Recent personal computer equip- ment tests covered a wide technology range, cons istent with what is typically in use in   9 Radasky, William A., The Threat of Intentional Electr omagnetic Interference (IEMI) to Wired and Wireless Systems .

Results indicate that some computer failures can be expected at relatively low EMP field levels of 3 to 6 kilovolts per me ter (kV/m). At higher field levels, additional failures are likely in computers, routers, network switches, and keyboards embedded in the computer-aided dispatch, public safety radio, and mobile data communications equipment. A variety of mobile radios were tested in the stored, dormant, and operating states, in both handheld and vehicle-mounted configurat ions. Consistent with older test data, 10 none of the radios showed a ny damage with EMP fields up to 50 kV/m. While many of the operating radios experienced latching upset s at 50 kV/m field levels, these were cor- rectable by turning power off and then on. Howe ver, most of the fixed installation public safety radio systems include telecommunica tion links between the computer-aided dis- patch terminals and the main or repeater radi o units. Therefore, because of computer fail- ures in dispatch equipment, communication system failures might occur at EMP field levels as low as 3 to 6 kV/m. Based on these results, we anticipate that several major functions of PSAPs will be affected by an EMP attack. The significance and duration of th e impact of these failures will depend on multiple factors such as the ability of technical staff to repair or replace damaged equipment and the existence of plans and procedures to cope with the specific type of failure. For example, based on a review of representative Y2K public safety contingency plans, loss of the computer-aid ed dispatch capability can be overcome by the use of simple note cards for manually recording the information needed for dispatch. However, loss of the mobile radio communications or the incoming commercial telecommunications functions could be more difficult to counteract. Typically, local jurisdictions rely on nearby PSA Ps or alternate locations to overcome these types of fail- ures. In an EMP attack, these contingency plans may fail because of the wide area of effects. I I n n t t e e r r o o p p e e r r a a b b i i l l i i t t y y S S w w i i t t c c h h e e s s . . These switches are contained in many PSAPs to facilitate direct communications among local, regional, and state public safety departments and federal agencies after major disasters. The ma in elements of the interoperability switch capability are the public safety radios, the switch unit itself, and the computer network link between the switch unit and the dispatch co nsole. The public safety radios that were tested as part of this assessment were base d on the equipment used in a fully operational interoperability switch. 11 The testing was performed with the equipment in stored, dor- mant, and operating states. No failures were ex perienced at test levels up to 50 kV/m. The interoperability switch was also tested up to 50 kV/m with no adverse effects. Based on these results, the interoperability switch capability is expected to function normally after an EMP attack. However, the computer network link between the interop- erability switch and the dispatch station may fail at field levels as low at 3 to 6 kV/m. This would necessitate manua l operation of the switch to implement the connections among various law enforcement, fire, and EMS agencies. V V e e h h i i c c l l e e s s . .

Electronic equipment found on many of the mo bile units also was tested. This equip- ment included a computer, personal data assist ant, mobile and portable radios, defibrilla- tors, and vital signs monitors. No permanent failures were experienced at levels up to 70 kV/m. Thus, we anticipate that the electronics in emergency services mobile units will continue to function normally, but they may suffer some initial effects due to latching upset of electronic devices.

The survey confirmed that the vast majo rity of EOC communications depends on the Public Telecommunications Ne twork (PTN). Thus, the abil ity of the EOC personnel to communicate and therefore provide emergency coordination will be highly dependent on the capability of the public telecommunications infrastructure to operate after an EMP event. EOCs typically have at least one FEMA-o wned and -maintained high-frequency (HF) radio for connectivity among na tional, regional, and state EOCs. The survivability of these HF radio units was not assessed. However, the operating band of these radios is one factor that makes them pot entially vulnerable to EMP attack. Backup communications links may include satellite telephone systems and capabilities provided by amateur radio operator organizations. EOCs also contain electronic equipment such as personal computers and digital data recorders. As with PSAPs, th e capabilities supported by such equipment are vulnerable to EMP field levels as low as 3 to 6 kV/m. Some EOCs are located below ground, which provides some protection from radiated EMP fields. However, conductive lines penetrati ng into these facilitie s must still be pro- tected to ensure EMP survivability.

The primary method of init iating an emergency alert message involves the use of multiple commerci al telecommunications lines. Therefore, the ability to provide emergency alert messa ges depends first on th e status of the com- mercial telecommunications system. Broadcast of an alert message and receipt by the affected public depends on several electroni c systems, including commercial radio and television stations, EAS multimodule receiv ers and encoders/decoders, and commercial radio and television receivers. We performed site surveys of both a radi o station and a televi sion station. Backup power generators and spare tran smitter equipment were found at both faciliti es. While not all commercial broadcast stations include su ch backup systems, the EAS has significant redundancy; some, but not all, broadcast statio ns are necessary for successful transmis- sion of an emergency alert message. We tested commonly used multimodule receiver and encoder/decoder units. The AM receiver module in its dormant mode failed at a field level of 44 kV/m. The FM receiver module exhibited erratic signal levels at 50 kV/m. No othe r effects were noted in testing EAS-specific equipment.

Emergency Services 155 vehicles. In one AM radio installed in a ve hicle, a malfunction occu rred at approximately 40 kV/m. All other items showed no malfunctions. Based on these results, we expect that the EAS will be able to function in near-normal fashion following an EMP attack. The major imp act that might occur is a delay in initia- tion and receipt of an alert message because of (1) the dependency on the commercial telecommunications system, (2) the loss of some receiver channels for the EAS equip- ment, (3) the potential loss of some radio and television stat ions from power loss or dam- age to transmitter components, and (4) th e loss of some AM radio receivers. I I n n t t e e r r d d e e p p e e n n d d e e n n c c i i e e s s . . In addition to direct damage, em ergency services will be degraded to the extent that they are dependent on othe r infrastructures that are themselves damaged by the EMP attack. Emergency services are most directly dependent on the electric power, telecommunications, transp ortation, and fuel infrastructu res. Fire departments also are dependent on the availability of water. EM P damage to these infrastructures can seri- ously degrade emergency services. Of particular importance, emergency services are heavily dependent on the ability of the Nation’s PTN to process 9-1-1 calls in a timely manner. After an EMP event, the PTN is likely to experience severe delays in processing calls. 12 Since 9-1-1 call s are processed using the same PTN equipment as non-9-1-1 ca lls (until they reach special 9-1-1 call- processing equipment located in a tandem cen tral office assigned to each PSAP), they will be subject to delays similar to those fo r nonemergency calls. In the short term, this will result in a large number of lost 9-1-1 calls. After several days, the operation of the PTN is expected to return to near norma l, assuming no adverse effects from either extended widespread power outages or from an inability to replenish fuel supplies for backup generators. However, in the event of a widespread power outage that extends beyond the time that backup power is available or commercial power service is restored, the PTN’s ability to process 9-1-1 calls will again degrade. Eventually, extended wide- spread power outages will result in an inabil ity to replenish fuel supplies, essentially causing a complete loss in PTN capability to process any 9-1-1 calls. Loss of power can also directly impact PSAP operations. In the s hort term, the loss of commercial power will impact local emergenc y services more from the standpoint of increased calls for assistance than from functional impact. Most PSAPs and EOCs have backup power generators that will allow uninterrupted operation for some time period. Long-term power outages might result in th e loss of PSAPs and EOCs because of an inability to refuel the backup generators. Consequences The ultimate consequences of an increased demand for emergency services and a concomitant degradation in emer- gency services capabilities are measured in lives lost, health impaired, and prop- erty damaged. We have no way of accu- rately estimating th ese consequences; we can only cite suggestive statistics.   12 See Chapter 3, Telecommunications.   We have no accurate way to measure the impact of degraded emergency ser- vices on lives lost, health impaired, or property damaged.

Emergency Services 156 Most importantly, we note that the lives a nd health of many people depend on medical technologies that, in turn, depend on electri c power. People will turn to emergency ser- vices if that power is unava ilable for an extended period. Emergency medical services respond to ap proximately 3 million 9-1-1 calls annually for people with cardiac problems and 2.5 million others for respiratory problems. 13 Fire departments responded to 1,687,500 fires in 2002. These fires re sulted in property damage estimated at $10.3 billion and 3,380 civilian deaths. 14 Lives and property saved by fire departments are undoubtedly also very large numbers. Other direct consequences would result from the inability to successfully place a 9-1-1 call. Missed 9-1-1 calls can result from any number of causes, including (1) PTN outages; (2) EMP-induced damage to PSAPs, PSAP rep eaters, mobile communications, or other critical support equipment; and (3) failure of commercial or residential telephone equipment. The principal indirect consequences of a d ecline or collapse of emergency services are a result of a reduction in the availability of th e work force. We did not attempt to quantify this effect, but note that it includes not only those directly affected, but also those who must now support those who previously w ould have depended on emergency services. Recommendations Our recommended strategy for protection and recovery of emergency services empha- sizes the establishment of technical standa rds for EMP protection of critical equipment and the inclusion of EMP in planning and training. The technology for critical emergency serv ices functions is undergoing extensive change, creating an excellent opportunity for inclusion of our recommended protection measures. This technology change is propelled in large part by the need for additional emergency services communica tions capability and the rec ognition that large-scale dis- asters, such as the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, re quire extensive coordination across the full spectrum of emergency services providers. Our strategy can be realized through implem entation of the following recommendations:  DHS and state and local governments should au gment existing plans and procedures to address both immediate and long-term emer gency services response to EMP attack. Plans should include provisions for a protect ion and recovery prot ocol based on grace- ful degradation and rapid recovery that em phasizes a balance between limited harden- ing and provisioning of spare components. Su ch a plan should ensure the following: — The National Emergency Number Association should establish guide- lines for operability and recovery of PSAPs during and after exposure to EMP. — The FCC should task the Network Reliability and Interoperability Cou- ncil to address the NS/EP services,   13 Estimates based on a survey of local PSA Ps, extrapolated to the entire country. 14 Statistics obtained from the National Fire Protection Association.   Our recommended strategy for protec- tion and recovery of emergency services emphasizes the establis hment of technical standards for EMP protection of critical equipment and the inclusion of EMP in planning and training.

S S p p a a c c e e S S y y s s t t e e m m s s Introduction Over the past few years, there has been increased focus on U.S. space systems in low Earth orbits and their unique vulnerabilities, among which is their susceptibility to nuclear detonations at high altitudes—the sa me events that produce EMP. It is also important to include, for the protection of a sate llite-based system in any orbit, its control system and ground infrastructure, incl uding up-link and down-link facilities. Commercial satellites support many signifi cant services for the Federal Government, including communications, remote sensi ng, weather forecasting, and imaging. The national security and homeland security comm unities use commercial satellites for criti- cal activities, including dire ct and backup communications, emergency response services, and continuity of operations during emergenc ies. Satellite services are important for national security and emergency preparedne ss telecommunications because of their ubiq- uity and separation from other communications infrastructures. The Commission to Assess United States National Security Space Management and Organization conducted an assessment of space activities that support U.S. national secu- rity interests and concluded that space system s are vulnerable to a ra nge of attacks due to their political and economic value. 1 Satellites in low Earth orbit generally are at risk of lifetime degradation or failure from collate ral radiation effects arising from an EMP attack on ground targets. In the course of an EMP attack, a nucle ar detonation at a high altitude produces numerous other effects that can impact the performance and survival of satellites. Examination of these effects relates to th e Commission’s mandate in two ways. First, nuclear weapon effects on satel lites can be collateral cons equences of an EMP attack. Second, an EMP attack can de grade ground terminals that sa tellite systems require for uplinks, downlinks, and control functions. This chapter focuses on two classes of effect s that are primary threats to the physical integrity of satellites: (1) direct, line-of-si ght exposure to nuclear radiation pulses (e.g., X-ray, ultraviolet, gamma-ray, and neutron pulses) and (2) ch ronic exposure to enhanced high-energy electrons durably trapped in th e Earth’s magnetic field. These effects can jeopardize satellites in orbit, as data from U.S. and Soviet high-alti tude nuclear tests of 1958 and 1962 attest. Figure 10-1 illustrates visible phenomen a from several U.S. high- altitude nuclear tests. Each detonation pr oduced copious X-ray fluxes and trapped ener- getic electron radiation in space. When the United States detonated the 1.4-megaton (MT) STARFISH 2 device on July 9, 1962, at 400 km altit ude, a total of 21 sa tellites were in orbit or were launched in weeks followi ng. Eight suffered radia tion damage that com- promised or terminated their missions. 3 Information concerning the fate of the remaining 13 satellites is not publicly available.   1 Report of the Commission to Assess United States National Security Space Management and Orga nization, January 11, 2001. 2 The high-altitude test originally known as STARFISH was not successful. A second high-altitude test called STARFISH PRIME was successfully execu ted at a later date to obtain the sought-after data. In much of the literature describing the damage to satellites from this te st, the name of the event is called STARFISH without the PRIME modifier. For the sake of brevity we also have dropped the modifier. 3 Brown, W.L., W.N. Hess, and J.A.

Space Systems 159 In many respects, satellite electronics of the 1960s were relatively robust against nuclear effects. Their bulk and comparativ ely low-speed operation tended to make elec- tronics of the era substantially less vulnerable to radiation upset and damage than modern electronics at comparable exposure levels. The discussion to follow highlights salient points of satellite vuln erabilities to nuclear explosions in the upper atmosphere or space. These vulnerabilities are considerable and in controvertible — each worldwide fleet of satellites is at risk, but the degree of risk depends on the ex tent of satellite hardening, satellite location relative to the burst, resu ltant line-of-sight exposure to prompt radia- tions, and each satellite’s exposure to geomagne tically trapped energeti c particles of natu- ral and nuclear origins. Figure 10-1. From left to ri ght, the ORANGE, TEAK, KINGFISH , CHECKMATE, and STARFISH high- altitude nuclear tests conduc ted in 1958 and 1962 by the United States near Johnston Island in the mid-Pacific. Burst conditions for each were unique, and each produced strikingly different phenome na and different enhancements of the radiation belts. Terms of Reference for Satellites Ubiquitous Earth-orbiting sate llites are a mainstay of modern critical national infra- structures. Satellites provi de Earth observations, commun ications, navigation, weather information, and other capabilities. The Unite d States experienced significant disruption when the pager functions of PanAmSat Galaxy IV failed in May 1998. Each satellite’s orbit is optimized for it s intended mission. Low Earth orbits (LEO), from 200 to 2,000 km altitude, are in proximity to the Earth and atmosphere to enable remote sensing, weather data collection, teleph- ony, and other functions. Geosynchronous (a.k.a. geostationary) orb its (GEO) lie at about 36,000 km altitude in the equatorial plane, where their 24-hour orb ital period matches the rotation of the Earth. This orbit allows GEO satellites to hover above a fixed longitude, useful for communications and monitoring of large-scale weather patterns. Satellites in highly elliptical orbits (HEO) perform specialized functions inaccessible to other orbits. For example, HEO satellites in high inclination orbits provide wide-area communications above high-latitude regions for several hours at a time. Figure 10-2 illustrates common orbits.

Space Systems 160 Attenuation of X-rays propaga ting through the upper atmosphe re is primarily by photo- electric absorption by oxygen and nitrogen and th erefore is a function of X-ray spectrum, with higher-energy photons penetrating grea ter path-integrated mass density along the line of sight. Consequently, for a detonati on above a (spectrally dependent) threshold altitude, X-rays emitted horizontally or upward will propagate to large distances virtually unattenuated by the atmosphere. X-rays emitted downward will be absorbed over ranges of tens of kilometers upon reaching sufficiently dense air. Neutrons and gamma rays emitted by a detonation similarly propagate upward great distances into space for detonations above thre shold altitudes. However, owing to scat- tering and absorption cross sections substantia lly smaller than X-ray photoelectric cross sections, major atmospheric attenuation of th ese energetic emissions occurs at altitudes below approximately 40 km. For detonations up to a few hundred kilometers altitude, blast wave interactions between expanding weapon debris and the atmosphere may convert a majority of the kinetic yield of the weapon to ultraviolet (UV) photons. These photons propagate upward into space with little attenuation. UV photons emitted horizontally and downward are absorbed in the vicinity of the burst point to form the UV fi reball. UV production for bursts above a few hundred kilometers declines rapidly, with precise values for these transition altitudes being functions of weapon output characteristics and dynami cs. The combined flux of energetic photons (X-ray, gamma, and UV) and neutrons irradiates a vast region of space, diminished by spherical di vergence, as shown in figure 10-3 . The actual size of the hazard zone depends on weapon yield, detonation altitude, and the degree of satellite hardening against disruption or harm. Damage to satellite structures and to coatings on solar panels and sensor optics occurs when X-ray and UV fluxes exceed critical thresholds. Electronics damage similarly ensues when X-ray and gamma pulses induce destructive electric currents in circuit elements and when energetic neutrons penetrate solid-state circuitry. Figure 10-3.

Space Systems 161 Persistently Trapped Ra diation and Its Effects In 1957, N. Christofilos at th e University of California Lawrence Radiation Laboratory postulated that the Earth’s magnetic field could act as a container to trap energetic electrons liberated by a high-altitude nuclear explosion to form a radiation belt that would encircle the Earth. 4 In 1958, J. Van Allen and colleagues at th e State University of Iowa used data from the Explorer I and III satellites to discover the Earth’s natural radiation belts. 5 Figure 10-4 provides an idealized view of the Van Allen belts. Later in 1958, the United States conducted three low-yield ARGUS high-altitude nuclear tests, producing nuclear radiation belts detected by the Explorer IV satellite a nd other probes. In 1962, larger tests by the United States and the Soviet Union produced more pronounced and longer lasting radiation belts that caused delete rious effects to satellites then in orbit or launched soon thereafter. A nuclear detonation is a significant source of free electrons originating from the highly ion- ized plasma that is a pro duct of the nuclear blast. Nuclear detonations also create trapped radiation by beta decay of radioactive weapon debris and free-space decay of neutrons from the explosion, thereby creating electrons with energies up to several million electron volts (MeV). The most notable tests producing radiation hazards to satellites were the U.S. STARFISH detonation and three high-altitude tests by the Soviets, all conducted in 1962. One assesses natural and trapped nuclear radi ation effects on contemporary satellites by calculating repeated passage of a satellite th rough radiation belts ove r the satellite’s life- time. While the geometry of a satellite’s orb it is relatively straightforward, characteriza- tion of spatial and temporal properties of both natural and nuclear radiation belts is a complex problem. Nevertheless, one can establish relative scaling of levels of vulnerabil- ity from radiation belt geometry, as shown in figure 10-5 . Intensities of radiation belts depend strongly on burst latitude. A burst at low latitude fills a small magnetic flux tube volume, so trapped flux tends to be concentrated and intense. The same burst at higher latitude fills a much larger magnetic flux tube volume. All quantitative assessmen ts of effects on sat- ellite lifetime provided in this chapter are based on calculations carried out using a code that tracks the satellite orbits through space and cal- culates the accumulated radiation dose.   4 Christofilos, N.C., Proceedings of the Nationa l Academy of Sciences, U.S. 45, 000, 1959. 5 Van Allen, J.A., and L.A.

Space Systems 162 Nuclear Weapon Effects on Electronic Systems Electronic systems perform many critical sp acecraft functions. An electronic power control system regulates the energy obtained fr om the solar cells. Attitude control circuits keep the vehicle oriented so that solar pa nels receive maximum e xposure to the sun and sensors face the Earth. Information collected by sensors must be processed, stored, and transmitted to the Earth on demand. Communica tions satellites receive information, pos- sibly process it, and then re transmit it, all by electronic circuits. Both prompt and long- term radiation effects have the potential for corrupting these functions in systems that lack hardening or other mitigation of nuclear effects. Total-Dose Damage A common criterion for failure of an electronic part is the total radiation energy per unit volume deposited in silicon. This absorbed energy density is expressed in rads(Si) (1 rad = 100 ergs/gram). Natural radiation to an electro nic part in the International Space Station (ISS) behind a 2.54 mm semi-inf inite (very large) al uminum slab averag es about 100 rads per year. Previous literature ha s commonly used this shieldin g thickness for satellite radia- tion exposure calculations. However, it should be noted that electronics are placed in a variety of locations in a satellite and, therefore, can have different levels of shielding. Natu- ral radiation to an electronic part in LEO, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellite, in polar orb it behind a 2.54 mm semi-infinite aluminum slab is, on long-term average, about 620 rads per year, while some satellites with the same shielding might receive 50 kilorads per year. 6 Electronics must be shielded in accordance with the intended orbit to limit the dose received to a tolerable level. Radiation-Induced Elect rostatic Discharge One hazard to spacecraft passing through the natu ral or nuclear radiation belts is inter- nal or “deep dielectric” charging. 7 Lower-energy electrons ( 40 to 300 keV) become embedded in surface materials or poorly shield ed internal materials and, on a timescale of hours to days, can build up sufficient electric fiel d to cause a discharge, often resulting in satellite upset and occasionally in serious da mage. Thermal blankets, external cables, and poorly shielded circuit boards are prime candi dates for this type of charging. Modern coverglasses and optical solar reflectors are made sufficiently conductive to avoid such local charge buildup. Radiation Effects Assessment and Hardening Susceptibility of elect ronic components to nuclear w eapon radiation has been studied intensively both experimentally and analytically since 1956. State-of-the-art computers and algorithms are used to extrapolate th e experimental results to an operational environment. The EMP Commission’s mission was to evalua te the threat of high altitude nuclear weapon-induced EMP on American national infras tructure. A collateral result of a high altitude burst is a radi ation threat to satellites, primar ily those residing in LEO.

These bursts would be at relatively high latitudes sufficient to allo w high-energy electr ons to migrate along geomagnetic field lines that reach the high altitudes at which ge osynchronous satellites reside. 9 Of course, at higher orbital altitudes, the density of ionizing radiation would be much reduced over that experienced by a satellite orbiting at lower altitudes and   8 It is conventional (and useful) to de scribe the magnetic field lines on which electrons are trapped as belonging to numbered L-shells. The L-value of a field line is the distan ce (in Earth radii measured from the location of Earth’s dipole field source) at which the field line intersects th e magnetic equator. The inner belt peaks around L = 1.3, and the outer belt, near L = 4. Trapped el ectrons rapidly gyrate about the field lines, bounce along the field lines between mirror points, and drift around the Earth. 9 As illustrated in figure 10-5 , magnetic field lines that intersect the Ea rth at high northern and southern latitudes extend outward into space to relatively large distances. Conve rsely, magnetic field lines that intersect the Earth at low latitudes extend relatively short distances into space. Consequently, geomagnetically trapped electrons created by detonations at high latitudes can propagate along field lin es out to very high altitudes where satellites orbit, whereas trapped electrons created by low-lati tude bursts would be less likely to do so."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 10.

The satellites ( table 10-2 ) were chosen to be representa tive of the many types and mis- sions in orbit and to be representati ve targets for the radiation effects. Prompt Radiation Effects When a weapon is detonated at high altitude, sa tellites that lie within line of sight of the burst will be subject to direct (X-ray) radiat ion. Satellites in the shadow cast by the Earth will not be directly irradiated, as illustrated in figure 10-3 , but will be subject to electron radiation as they transit debris and decay-pr oducts (primarily energetic beta electrons) mentioned previously that are trapped in the Earth’s magnetic field. If there is a signifi- cant mass of intervening atmosphere between th e detonation point and the satellite, direct nuclear radiation will be attenua ted. Lacking this intervening shield, the radiation fluence will decrease as the inverse square of the distance. Worst-case situations occur when a satellite is nearest the burst; for example, directly above or below it. In such cas es, the range between satellit e and burst is minimized, and X-ray, gamma, and neutron fluences on the sa tellite are maximize d. Full evaluation of this hazard requires statistical analysis. The likelihood that the satell ite will be in direct line of sight of the burst is typically 5 to 20 percent, depending on orbital parameters for the satellite and burst location. Even then, da mage may be ameliorated by either distance or intervening atmosphere. Calculations of X-ray expos ure probabilities were perf ormed for Events 9, 13, 17, and 18. The calculations yield the pr obability that a sp ecific satellite will be exposed to a specified level of X-ray fluence. Results appear in table 10-3 . With this information, one can estimate the probability of satellite damage based on known damage thresholds for spacecraft materials. Thresholds for various ty pes of damage were chosen at, or close to, values accepted by the engineering communit y. Here, thermomechanical damage refers to removal or degradation of the coatings on solar cell surfaces. Depending on nuclear weapon output spectra, coating damage is generally a satel lite’s most sensitive ther- momechanical damage mode. SGEMP (Syste m-Generated EMP) burnout is damage caused by currents associated with X-ray-i nduced electron emission. Latch-up is a logic state setting of a semiconductor device that becomes frozen as a result of radiation expo- sure. Latch-up may cause large currents to flow in the affected circuit, resulting in unac- ceptable current-induced damage (i.e., burnout). Line-of-sight exposure of the ISS to photons can cause signif icant damage to the solar- array coverglass coatings for Events 6, 7, 8, 9, and 17.

In evalu- ating the biological response of astronauts to radiation on th e ISS, 0.220 inches of slab shielding was assumed because the astronauts would usually be inside the pressurized modules of the space station. Some critical el ectronics for the stati on were still assumed to be shielded by only 100 mils of aluminum. Satellites are assumed to be hardened to twice the long-term-average natural background radiation encountered during a nominal mission. 10 Just as with photons, damage to spac ecraft thermal, optical, and other surface coatings is caused by exposure to el ectrons of relatively low energies. Except for the ISS in Event 4, even the lo w-yield events are capable of imposing a much-reduced lifetime on the satellites. In the set of events depicted in table 10-5 , the large weapon used in Event 17 inflicts severe damage on the ISS. Significantly, this exposure would cause radiation sickness to the astronauts within approximately 1 hour a nd a 90 percent probability of death within 2 to 3 hours.   10 While the use of twice the e xpected long-term-average exposure as a gauge of lifetime, as discussed here, is common practice, it relies entirely on total dose as a measure of radiation tolerance and ignores dose rate effects. Risks from circumstances involving nuclear detonati ons, where dose rates could be much larger than encountered under natural conditions, may be underestimated."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 10.

This is largely becaus e these satellites are designed to operate in a far more hostile natural space environment due to the solar wind than are those in LEO. Generally, most papers dealing with satell ite lifetimes following a high-altitude nuclear detonation treat radiation eff ects on newly launched satellite s with no pre-burst accumu- lated total dose. Except for satellites launche d as replacements after a detonation, a more realistic assessment would assume a high-altitude detonation after a satellite had been in orbit for a portion of its anticipated service life. If a satellite is near the end of its design lifetime (i.e., has accumulated the majority of the total dose it can to lerate) prior to the detonation, the dose absorbed from a nuclea r-pumped belt could cause prompt demise. To evaluate potential life-shor tening effects on satellites, we examined a constellation of generic satellite systems. To assess sensitivity to assumed hardening level, we evaluated two hypothetical constellations . One constellation was assumed hardened to 1.5 times the natural total dose anticipated over the desi gn lifetime (1.5x). The other constellation was assumed hardened to 2x. The scenario invol ved a 10 MT burst (50 percent fission yield) detonated on May 23, 2003, at an altitude of 90 km over nor thern Lake Superior (48.5 degrees north latitude, 87 degrees west longitude). Total dose for each constellation was based on realistic code calculations. Figure 10-6 shows the resulting number of sate llites remaining as a function of time after the burst. The blue and red curves correspond to the co nstellations hardened to 1.5x and 2x, respectively. Correspond ing outage times for ground-based receivers are shown in Figure 10-7 . Clearly, decreasing satellite hardeni ng by 25 percent has a marked effect on survivability in this case."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 10. Space Systems 167 Figure 10-6 . Satellites remaining afte r a 10 MT burst over Lake Superior Figure 10-7. Satellite ground-based receiver outage time after a 10 MT burst over Lake Superior HEO satellites already reside in orbits that are relatively challenging in terms of the natural radiation environment. Assuming these sa tellites are hardened to twice the natural dose they would normally accumula te in 15 years, a satellite’s electronics would be hard- ened to approximately 325 krad behind a 100 m il (0.1 inch) semi-infinite slab of alumi- num. With this level of har dness, one would expect that th ese satellites would not be vul- nerable to a high-altitude burst of a single, low-yield (appr oximately 50 kT) device of unsophisticated design. Realistic code calculations suggest th is is indeed the case. Three large-yield events were investigated to determine whether they would present a threat to HEO satellites. Two of these events (Events 11 and 21) would not present a total ionizing dose problem for the satellite. Although Event 21 is a 10-MT burst, it has little effect on a HEO satellite because the trapped el ectrons are spread out over a large L-shell region. In contrast, the 100 kT of Event 11 does result in some detectable radiation accu- mulation on the satellite as it passes through alti tudes near perigee. The yield is, however, too low to present a threat to the satellite. A 5-MT burst depicted in Event 17, on the other hand, does present a substantial threat to HEO satellites, given the hardening assumptions mentioned earlier. Figure 10-8 shows that the assumed 2x natural hardening level of the satellite is exceeded about 36 days after Event 17. Analysis of direct EMP attacks over the northern continental United States (CONUS) or Canada indicates lesser ri sk to LEO satellites from w eapons with yields ranging from 10 kT to 100 kT. For yields approaching 1 MT (or greater) detonated at such latitudes, it becomes more difficult to predict the fate of LEO satellites. The larger yields make more severe nuclear-enhanced trapped flux environm ents, but depletion rates of trapped fluxes (both natural and nuclear) are difficult to predict. Satellite Ground Stations Although bursts over CONUS may not directly damage satellites, the EMP effect on ground control stations could sti ll render some satellites inoperable. We have focused our analyses on collateral weapon e ffects on satellites, without di scussion of EMP effects on ground stations used for uplinks, downlinks, a nd satellite control.

HEO satellite exposure to trapped radiation produced by Events 11, 17, and 21 important satellite systems use unique tran smission protocols with dedicated ground terminals. Unique protocols limit interopera bility, so loss of de dicated ground terminals could readily compromise overall functionality of a system, even if the system’s satellites remained undamaged. While satellites generally are designed to operate autonomously, with periodic house- keeping status downloads to ground contro llers and uploads of commands, once dam- aged, satellites may require frequent, perh aps continuous, control from the ground to remain even partially functional. Thus, loss of ground stations to EMP could render oth- erwise functional satellites ineffective or lead to premature loss. A comprehensive analysis of overall satellite system degradation should include poten- tial loss of ground stations and cost/benefit trade-offs with respect to EMP hardening. A scenario-based analysis would reveal the extent to which loss of individual ground sta- tions may pose an additional level of vulnerability. Discussion of Results Given inherent satellite fragility owing to severe weight constraints, any nation with missile lift capability and sufficient technology in the requisite disciplines can directly attack and destroy a satellite . Such attacks are outside the focus of this study. The Com- mission considered only hazards to satellites th at may arise as collateral nuclear weapon effects during an EMP attack. The prominent co llateral hazards are prompt nuclear output (X-rays, gamma rays, and neutrons), high fl uences of UV photons generated by some high-altitude nuclear detonati ons, and nuclear burst enhancement (pumping) of the radia- tion belts surrounding the Earth in the re gion of space where satellites orbit. The worst-case exposure of a satellite to di rect x-radiation from a nuclear weapon can be lethal. For LEO satellites, the threat can be nonne gligible, but for satellites at GEO, the large distance between a detonation designed for an EMP attack and a satellite makes the probability of direct damage very low. The same argument holds for exposure to gamma rays, neutrons, and burst-generated UV light."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 10. Space Systems 169 Nuclear-enhanced radiation belts must be cons idered differently, owing to their persis- tence and wide spatial distribution around th e Earth. Because the natural trapped radia- tion environment at GEO is more severe on av erage than at most LEO locations, satellites at GEO typically are hardened to a greater exte nt than LEO satellites . Absent large yields (megatons), burst-generated energetic electr on fluxes trapped in hi gh-latitude (i.e., high L-shell) magnetic flux tubes generally are not sufficiently intense and long-lasting to cause the early demise of satellites in GE O, unless those satellites have accumulated sufficient natural radiation exposure to put them near the end of their service lives. 11 Satellites in LEO are much more susceptible to damage from both direct and persistent radiation that results from an EMP attack, bu t the possibility of da mage is highly depend- ent on weapon parameters (latitude and long itude, height of burst [HOB], and weapon yield). Line-of-sight exposure of LEO research sate llites such as ISS to X-ray and UV photons can cause significant damage to solar-array coverglass coatings for Events 6, 8, 9, 17, and 19. While such exposures are statistically infreq uent, in those instances where they occur, they will result in immediate loss of many op erational capabilities , as well as loss of power generating capacity. The low-energy component of trapped-electron flux from beta decay of fission products and decay of free neutrons exceeds the long-term average natural flux for the high-yield Events 8, 9, and 17. Such flux levels will cau se electrostatic breakdown in certain types of thermal radiator coatings and external cables on NOAA and TERRA within the first few days following the burst. Uncertainties in Estimates Uncertainties in satell ite vulnerabilities result from im precise knowledge of threat envi- ronments, combined with uncertainties in resp onses of satellite materials to those envi- ronments. Difficulties in characterizing aging effects of materials exposed to on-orbit conditions for extended periods exacerbate these uncertainties. In the following comments, it is assumed that the weapons in question mirror U.S. technology available in th e time frame 1970 to 1980. Uncertainties in direct line-of -sight exposure of a satellite to radiation from a nuclear detonation result primarily from unknowns asso ciated with the design of an offensive weapon, its delivery system, and its detonation altitude. These factors determine the frac- tion of weapon yield emitted as photons, neutrons , and beta particles and, hence, the type and magnitude of damage they inflict on satellites. Variability of weapon designs is esti- mated to lead to an uncertainty of approximately plus or minus a factor of five in UV hazard source strength (radiation primarily em itted from a weapon’s case and its pack- aging within a delivery vehi cle [but see below for more on UV photons]). Based on com- putational correlations with experimental data , there exits at least a factor of 10 uncer- tainty in X-ray spectral intensity at arbi trary photon energies of a kilovolt or more. Uncertainties in gamma-ray fluence and flux pr edictions are thought to be on the order of ±15 percent, as are those for prompt neutrons. Total yield is believed to be accurate to ±10 percent.   11 The reader is reminded that our analysis deals only with collateral damage resulting from an EMP attack. Direct attack on satellites at any altitude, though seri ous, is not within the bounds of this analysis."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 10. Space Systems 170 For bursts below a few hundred kilometers alti tude, the debris-air blast-wave-generated fluence of UV photons (which can be as large as 80 percent of the kinetic yield of the device) carries an estimated uncertainty fact or of 3 to 10, depending primarily on device characteristics. These uncertainty factors are ameliorated to some degree by decreasing burst altitude. Detonations below approximately 90 km occur in sufficiently dense air that UV photons are largely absorbed before they can escape to space. Uncertainties in trapped radiation environm ents from high-altitude nuclear detonations also result from unknowns in offensive weapon design, but additional uncertainties arise in dispersal of radioactive w eapon debris, efficiency with which beta particles become trapped in the geomagnetic field, subsequent transport of trapped pa rticles, and the rapid- ity with which nuclear-burst enhancements of the radiation belts decay into the natural background. Under the best of circumstances, uncertainties in the intensity and persis- tence of trapped radiation estimated for the even ts considered in this report are at least a factor of 10 and are likely substantially more in situations that depart from limited cir- cumstances of past nuclear tests. Findings Potential Vulnerabilities An EMP attack on any of several important geographic regions could cause serious damage to LEO satellites. The STARFISH hi gh-altitude nuclear burst greatly enhanced the high-energy electron environment in LEO, resulting in the early demise of several satellites on orbit at the time. 12 Copious documentation exists that describes recent radia- tion-induced satellite failures due to the natural radiation environment alone. Given the large uncertainties discussed above , there may be a temptation to ignore the issue of high-altitude nuclear threats to sa tellites for the time being simply because insufficient information is available to impl ement a cost-effective protection solution. We believe that ignoring the issue would be ill a dvised for a number of reasons, including the consequences of losing possibly tens of billi ons of dollars in LEO space assets in a short time. Mitigation of Threats Any adversary possessing a lift and orbiting control capabilit y can destroy a satellite: it is clearly neither cost effective nor desirable to harden every satellite against every possi- ble threat. The challenge is to weigh risks/rewards of mitigation against mission priorities and plausible threats. A number of threat mitigation measures exist or have been pro- posed as an alternative or supplement to hardening. Any combination of hardening and mitigation options can be chosen to achieve the required degree of survivabi lity. Alternatives must be explored, documented, and reviewed so that management and users of space assets can make rational appraisals of the costs, benefits, and consequences of space system degradation and/or loss.

Space Systems 171 provided to commercial satellites because, from the commercial operator’s perspective, it is not cost effective to do so. The cost of hardening a system has been a subject of continuing controversy for the past 45 years. Systems project offices tend to estimate high to avoid the introduction of measures that threaten to esca late system cost. Achievable co st control is contingent upon ab initio design of radiation hardness into the system rather than on retrofitting it. Options other than hardening and shielding include re positioning selected satellites in times of stress to minimize exposure to enhanced radiation belts. If the ground stations for satellites in any orb it are not hardened to EMP, the utility of the satellites could degrade, depending on their ability to ope rate autonomously. Recommendations  Each Federal Government organization that acquires and/or uses space should execute a systematic assessment of the significance of each such space system, particularly those in low Earth orbits, to its missions. Information from this assessment and associ- ated cost and risk judgments will inform senior government decision-making regard- ing protection and performance assurance of these systems, so that each mission can be executed with the required degree of surety in the face of possible threats."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 11. Government 172 C C h h a a p p t t e e r r 1 1 1 1 . . G G o o v v e e r r n n m m e e n n t t Introduction A primary role of the Federal Government is to defend the Nation against threats to its security. EMP represents one such threat. Inde ed, it is one of a small number of threats that can hold our society at risk of catas trophic consequences. The Executive branch of the Federal Government bears the responsibilit y for executing a strategy for dealing with this threat. The Commission has recommended a strategy for addressing this threat that combines prevention, protection, and recovery. It represents what we believe to be the best approach for addressing the EMP threat. The Commission has identified an array of recommendations relating to civilian infra- structures that are logical outgrowths of our recommended strategy. Those recom- mendations relating to civilian infrastructures are contained in the i ndividual chapters of this volume and will not be repeated here. Implementation of these recommendations will result in the identification of responsibilities at the region al, state, and local levels. The Federal Government not only has th e responsibility for being appropriately postured to cope with all aspects of the EMP threat, including preparations for recovery, but also has the responsibility to be able to respond to and manage national recovery in a competent and effective manner in the wake of an EMP attack. American citizens expect such competence and effectiveness from responsib le government officials at all levels. In order to properly manage re sponse and recovery, essentia l government functions will have to survive and function in the wake of an EMP attack. Maintaining Government Connectivity and Coherence It is essential that the Government con tinues to function through an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) emergency. Events over the last few years have highlighted the need for assured and real-time communications connect ivity between government leadership and organizational assets for both crisis manage ment and the management of a controlled recovery. Plans to ensure the continued f unctioning of government are embodied in Con- tinuity of Operations (COOP) plans prepared by government organizations in anticipation of emergency situations and Continuity of Government (COG) planning to ensure the survival of constitutional government. Nationa l Security Presidentia l Directive 51 (NSPD 51) and Homeland Security Presidential Di rective 20 (HSPD 20 on the subject of “National Continuity Policy”, as described in a White House summary released May 9, 2007 1 ), outlines these issues and directs the implementation of COOP and COG (excerpts noted below). The EMP Commission met with Na tional Security Council staff to discuss COG-related issues as they might relate to EMP threats. However, COG planning remains highly classified, and only this top- level overview can be provided within this venue. Recommendations  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) should give priority to measures that ensure the President and other senior Federal officials can exercise informed leader- ship of the Nation in the aftermath of an EMP attack and that improve post-attack response capabilities at all levels of government.   1 National Security and Homeland Security Presidential Directive, http://www.whitehouse.gov/news /releases/2007/05/20070509-12.html ."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 11. Government 173  The President, Secretary of Homeland Securit y, and other senior offi cials must be able to manage national recovery in an inform ed and reliable manner. Current national capabilities were developed for Cold War s cenarios in which it was imperative that the President have assured connectivity to strategic retaliatory forces. While this require- ment is still important, there is a new need for considerably broader and robust con- nectivity between national l eaders, government at all levels, and key organizations within each infrastructure sector so that the status of infrastructure s can be assessed in a reliable and comprehensive manner and th eir recovery and re constitution can be managed intelligently. The DHS, working through the Homeland Security Council, should give high priority to identifying and achieving the minimum level of robust connectivity needed for recovery following an EMP attack. In doing so, DHS should give particular emphasis to exercises that evaluate the robustness of the solutions being implemented.  Working with state authorities and priv ate sector organiza tions, the DHS should develop draft protocols for implementa tion by emergency and other government responses following an EMP attack, Re d Team these extensively, and then institutionalize validated protocols thr ough issuance of sta ndards, training, and exercises.

Such effects have not been observed for th e personnel who operate EMP simulators. 1 Medical surveillance studies on human exposure to pul sed electromagnetic fi elds have supported this inference. 2 An important exception is people whose we ll-being depends on elect ronic life support equipment. They will be direct ly impacted by effects that di srupt or damage such devices. Research sponsored by the Commission suggest s that some heart pacemakers may be among the devices susceptible to upset from high-altitude EMP. 3,4 While most effects on people would be indirect , they could be signi ficant in a just-in- time economy in which local stocks of medi cines, baby food, and other health-critical items are limited. The physical consequences of the serious high-altitude EMP attacks on the United States (U.S.) of concern to the Commission would likely include the failure of the electric power grid and de gradation of telecommunicati on systems, computers, and electronic components over large areas of the country. A disruption of this scale could cripple critical infrastructures and hinder th e delivery of day-to-day necessities, because of the interconnectivity of telecommunication networks and the electrical dependence of most cities, government agencies, businesses, households, and individuals. It also could require a long recovery period. To assess hum an consequences, the contingency of con- cern is one in which electrici ty, telecommunications, and electronics are out of service over a significant area for an extended period of time. The human consequences of such a scenario include the social an d psychological reac- tions to a sudden loss of stabili ty in the modern infrastructure over a large area of the country. Loss of connectivity between th e government and its populace would only exac- erbate the consequences of such a scenario. This analysis is based largely on selected case studies, including major blackouts, natu- ral disasters, and terrorist incidents in recen t U.S. history. These incidents served as approximate analogs in order to best predict the sociological and ps ychological effects of an EMP attack. Impact of an EMP Attack While no single event serves as a model for an EMP scenario with incidence of long- lasting widespread power outage, communicat ions failure, and other effects, the com- bined analysis of the followi ng case studies provides useful insight in determining human reactions following an EMP attack: Blackouts:  Northeast (1965)  New York (1977)   1 Patrick, Eugene L., and William L.

New Hampshire; Vermont; Massachusetts; Connecticut; Rhode Island; New York, including metropolitan New York City; and a sm all part of Pennsylvani a were in the dark after operators at Consolidated Edison were fo rced to shut down its generators to avoid damage. Street traffic was chaotic, and some people were trapped in elevators, but there were few instances of antisocial be havior while the lights were out. 5 It was a “long night in the dark,” but the recovery proceeded without incident, and citizens experienced rela- tive civility. TIME Magazine described New York’s next blackout, in 1977, as a “Night of Terror.” 6 Widespread chaos reigned in the city until power was restored — entire blocks were looted and set ablaze, people flipped over cars and vans on the streets; the city was in pandemonium. That night 3,776 arrests were made , and certainly not al l looters, thieves, and arsonists were apprehended or arrested. 7 While this is a dramatic example of antiso- cial behavior following a bl ackout, sociologists point to extraordinary demographic and historical issues that contributed to the looting. For instance, extreme poverty and socio- economic inequality plagued New York ne ighborhoods, and many of the looters origi- nated from the poorer sections of the city, engaging in “vigilante redistribution” by loot- ing consumer goods and luxuries. Racial tensi ons were high, and a serial killer known as Son of Sam had recently terrorized New Yorkers. In 1989, more than 6 million customers lost power when the geomagnetic storm dis- cussed in Chapter 4 caused a massive power fa ilure in Quebec. The electricity failures caused by this geomagnetic storm reached a much larger area than is typically affected by traditional blackouts resulting from technological failure. However, the outage lasted just over 9 hours, most of which were during the day. 8 The local and national papers were curiously silent about the blackout, and little to no unusual or adverse human behavior was attributed to the power loss. The event was most significantly a lesson for operators of the North American electric grids because it revealed vulnerabilities in the system.   5 “The Great Northeast Blackout of 1965,” http ://www.ceet.niu.edu/ facu lty/vanmeer/outage.htm . 6 Sigwart, Charles P., “Night of Terror,” Time , July 25, 1977. 7 “1977 New York Blackout,” Blac kout History Project, http://b lackout.gmu.edu/events/tl1977.html . 8 Kappenman, John G., “Geoma gnetic Storms Can Threaten Electric Power Grid,” Earth in Space, Vol. 9, No. 7, March 1997, pp.9-11 .© 1997 American Geophysical Un ion. http://www.agu.org/sc i_soc/eiskappenman.html ."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 12. Keeping The Citizenry Informed: Effects On People 178 In 1998, Auckland, New Zealand, experienced a significant blackout that lasted more than 5 weeks and affected more than 1 million people. 9 Civility reigned for the duration of the outage, which was likely attributed to a number of factors, including:  There was no significant threat to public health, because water a nd sewage infrastruc- tures were functioning.  In anticipation of potential incidents, police increased th eir presence in urban areas.  The recovery process was underway nearly immediately, communi cating to the public that the situation would ev entually be under control.  Nearly all blackout recovery resources of New Zealand were rushed to the capital for recovery efforts. Recovery efforts from elsewhere in New Zeal and were significant symbolically as well as practically, as demonstrated by the fact th at electricity was available elsewhere. Busi- nesses attempted to carry on as normally as possible, with some examples of opportun- ism, such as businesses relocating to more de sirable spaces that had been vacated. Social consequences included criticism and blame of the authorities, both municipal and national, because the technological failures were attributed in large part to privatization of the power sector. However, this response never materialized into violence, crime, or social disorder. Most recently, New York City and the eight states in the northeast experienced another significant blackout in August 2003. While th e blackout inconvenienced many on a hot summer day, general civility remained intact. News coverage indicated that those affected by the blackout dealt with the obstacles quietly and even de veloped a sort of camaraderie while struggling through nights without running water and electricity. In contrast to the 1977 blackout, police made only 850 arrests the night of the 2003 black- out, of which “only 250 to 300 were directly at tributable to the blackout,” indicating a slight decline from the average number of arrests on a given summer day. 10 While this blackout was widespread, it was not long lastin g, and it did not in terrupt the communica- tions infrastructure significantly. Blackouts provide only a partial picture of life following an EMP attack. Most blackouts are localized and are resolved quick ly. Further, usually communication systems are not completely shut down, and major infras tructures can remain intact if significant portions of infrastructure hardware are located outside of the affected area. In order to best approximate the effects of longer-lasting, widespread infrastruc ture disruption—with or without electrical power failure—it is necessary to look to natural disasters for examples of human reaction. Natural Disasters At the time that Hurricane Hugo hit in 1989, it was the most intense hurricane to strike Georgia and the Carolinas in 100 years. Su rveys of Hurricane Hugo’ s survivors indicate that some individuals who suffered persona l and financial losses from the hurricane showed clinically significant symptoms of psychological trauma. According to some researchers, many of the adverse mental he alth effects of Hugo could be explained by deterioration in perceived social support. While on the whole, the rate of post-traumatic   9 “Power failure brings New Zeala nd’s largest city to standstill,” C NN, http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9802/24/ nzealand.blackout/index.html . 10 Adler, Jerry, et al, “The Day the Lights Went Out,” Newsweek ; August 25, 2003, Vol. 142, Issue 8, p. 44."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Chapter 12. Keeping The Citizenry Informed: Effects On People 179 stress disorder symptoms was low, stress effects lingered long after the hurricane’s physical damage was repaired. Hurricane Andrew blew through the southeastern United Stat es and along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico in 1992, causing $26.5 billion in damage. Andrew left 250,000 fami- lies homeless and 1.4 million families without electricity immediately following the hur- ricane. After such extraordinary destructi on and disruption, it is perhaps not surprising that one-third of a sample of individuals me t criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder 4 months after the hurricane. 11 Hurricanes Hugo and Andrew de monstrated to psychologists that disaster-related declines in perceived support explained the difference in symptoms between the two dis- asters; deterioration was more significant in Andrew and recovery was weaker. In the long-lasting recovery period, Floridians sa w looting, opportunism, and vigilante civil defense. Press coverage of Hurricane Andrew suggests that after a multi-state disaster, people will expect help, and they will expect it from the federal government, as well as from state and local authorities. Flooding in the American Midwest in 1993 result ed in 25 deaths, affected more than 8 million acres, and cost billions of dollars in property damage and more than 2 billion dollars in crop damage. Water depths ranged from 11 feet of floodi ng in Minneapolis to 43 feet in St. Louis. Electricity was restored where possible within 3 days and in down- town Des Moines within 23 hours. The floods devastated families, businesses, and indi- viduals, who lost nearly everything and we re unable to control events throughout the recovery process. Thousands of people assisted in voluntee r recovery efforts by sandbag- ging and providing needed supplies. 12 Most came from unaffected areas to help the most urgent victims. The floods pr ovide an example of widespr ead damage crippling several infrastructures for a significant period of time and an example of a disaster in which regional experience may matter trem endously in disaster recovery. Blackouts and natural disasters have limits as approximations of r ecovery following an EMP attack. An important element is the releva nce of fear and individual panic in these situations versus what might occur following an EMP attack. For this component, it is useful to examine recent terrorist incidents in the United States in order to gauge the effects of fear among the public. Because terroris t attacks appear to be indiscriminate and random, they can arouse acute anxiety and feelin gs of helplessness, which shatter beliefs of invulnerability and even a belief in justice and order in the world. Terrorist Incidents The attacks on the World Trade Center in New York on September 11, 2001, certainly qualified as seemingly indiscriminate and random. Following this disaster, in which nearly 3,000 people died, those in the imme diate and surrounding area showed consider- able psychological trauma and damage. Some individuals who experienced these attacks may have lost confidence in their abilities to cope and control ou tcomes. Overall, how- ever, the survivors of the att acks proved remarkably resilient, flexible, and competent in the face of an arbitrary, violent, and completely unexpected attack. 13   11 Norris, et al, “60,000 Disaster Victim s Speak: Part 1.

Keeping The Citizenry Informed: Effects On People 180 In October 2001, a month following the attack on the World Trade Center, Americans saw a series of anthrax-infected mail pieces threatening intended mail recipients and han- dlers. The death toll was small (five indivi duals), but public concern was considerable. This period is an example of public response to an adversary-initiated threat that dis- rupted infrastructure. The public demonstrated a grea t need for control over the situation, through preparedness and information. For example, many Americans took protective measures, despite the astronomical odds agai nst infection. The news media were satu- rated with reports of anthra x infections, suspected infect ions, and general information about anthrax and how to respond to inf ection. Though no culprit was apprehended, the attacks stopped, and normal postal activity resumed. Some Lessons Learned Though the United States has not experienced a severe, widespread disruption to infra- structure comparable to an EMP attack, the cases reviewed provide some practical direc- tion for predictions of behavior . For example, it can be expect ed that emotional reactions such as shock and paralysis that have follo wed past disasters could be magnified in a large-scale event such as an EMP attack. In particular, the paralysi s of government assis- tance entities, such as law enforcement a nd emergency services, would aggravate this effect. In most instances, social disorder woul d be minimal, in significant part, due to the knowledge that authorities are in control of th e situation. Without that assurance from an outside source, it appears li kely that people would turn to immediate neighbors or com- munity members for information and support, if possible. Following disruptive disasters, information is among the most pressing needs for indi- viduals. Not surprisingly, people’s first concer ns are the whereabouts and safety of their family members and friends. Another urgent prio rity is an understanding of the situation — knowledge of what has happened, who and wh at is affected, and the cause of the situation. A related yet di stinct information need is for c onfirmation that th e situation will be resolved, either from common sense and experience, in the case of a small-scale dis- aster, or from the involvement of local or fede ral authorities, in the case of a large-scale disaster. Psychologists note that dramatic ev ents force people to reexamine their basic understanding about the world, an d that survivors need to pr ocess an event before they can fully absorb it. This information processing begins the alternating phases of intrusion and avoidance that are primary i ndicators of post-traumatic stress. 14 The aftermath of natural disasters is often ma rked by instances or a period of consider- able pro-social behavior such as cooperati on, social solidarity, and acts of selflessness. However, this encouraging observation might not be similarly magnified in projections for human behavior following an EMP attac k. The key intangible, immeasurable differ- ence is the knowledge that nor mal order would resume, based on significant indicators. It is important to note some of the differe nces between natural disasters and technologi- cal disasters, particularly t hose caused by human intent. Natural disasters “create a social context marked by an initial overwhelming consensus regardi ng priorities and the alloca- tion of resources,” 15 which explains the enormous outpouring of voluntary support following the floods of 1993. In contrast to na tural disasters, whic h “occur as purpose-   14 Norris, et al, “60,000 Disaster Victim s Speak: Part II.

Keeping The Citizenry Informed: Effects On People 181 less, asocial events; civil disturbances can be viewed as instrumentally initiated to achieve certain social goals.” 16 An EMP attack would certain ly be perceived similarly, whether the adversary were a terr orist organization or a state. The selected case studies provide only an a pproximation of EMP effects. For example, the effects of the knowledge that widespread infrastructure disruption resulted from an intentional foreign attack are yet unknown. Much evidence points to people’s resilience in the immediate aftermath of disasters. However, during a lengthy recovery process, as would be expected following an EMP attack with widespread, long-duration effects, the psychological effects of the att ack should not be underestimated. It appears clear that the most crucial question in the task of avoiding social disorder is how to establish communication without el ectricity immediately following an EMP attack. Without communication al ternatives, it would be impo ssible to alert people to the availability of emergency supplies or in form them concerning emergency response activities. It also appears clea r that greater awareness of the nature of an EMP attack and knowledge of what prudent preparations mi ght be undertaken to mitigate its conse- quences would be desirable. Accordingl y we make the following recommendations. Recommendations  Support to national leadership should involve measures to ensure that the President can communicate effectively with the citizenry.  Because many citizens would be without pow er, communications, and other services for days — or perhaps substa ntially longer — before full re covery could occur, during that interval, it will be crucial to provide a reliable channel of information to citizens to let them know what has ha ppened, what the current situa tion is, when help of what types might be available, what their governments are doing, and answers to the host of other questions that, if not answered, would almost certainly create more instability and suffering for the affected individuals, communities, and the Nation as a whole. In particular: — The Department of Homeland Security s hould play a leading role in spreading knowledge of the nature of prudent mitiga tion preparations for EMP attack to miti- gate its consequences. — The Department of Homeland Security should add content to Web sites it main- tains, such as www.Ready.gov, which provid es concise overviews of the threats posed by EMP attacks and geomagnetic st orms, summarizes steps that people should take given an incident and identif ies alternate or emergency communications channels. — The Department of Homeland Security shou ld work with state homeland security organizations to develop and exercise communications networks involving the organizations that normally operate in each community.   16 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Appendix A.

T T h h e e C C o o m m m m i i s s s s i i o o n n a a n n d d I I t t s s C C h h a a r r t t e e r r The Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Attack was establishe d by Congress through Title XI V of Public Law 106-398. Looking out 15 years, the Commi ssion was tasked to assess: 1) The nature and magnitude of potential high-altitude EMP threats to the United States from all potentially hostile states or non-state actors that have or could acquire nuclear weapons and ballistic mi ssiles enabling them to perform a high- altitude EMP attack against the United States within the next 15 years. 2) The vulnerability of United States military and especially civilian systems to an EMP attack, giving special attention to vulnerability of the civilian infrastructure as a matter of emergency preparedness. 3) The capability of the United States to repa ir and recover from damage inflicted on United States military and civilian systems by an EMP attack. 4) The feasibility and cost of hardening sel ect military and civilian systems against EMP attack. The Commission was also tasked to recomm end any steps it believes should be taken by the United States to better protect its m ilitary and civilian systems from EMP attack. In accord with its charter, the Commission focused on the electromagnetic pulse pro- duced by high-altitude nuclear weapon detonati ons, as opposed to other types of nuclear and non-nuclear EMP phenomena. Unless clearly i ndicated to the contra ry, all references to EMP are to the electromagnetic pulse pr oduced by a high-altitude nuclear detonation. This report presents the unanimous conclu sions and recommendations of the Commis- sioners.

The Commission and Its Charter A-2 Dr. Michael J. Frankel served as Executive Director of the Comm ission. He was also responsible for overseeing th e technical efforts in suppor t of the Commission accom- plished by both American and foreign organizations. The Institute for Defense Analysis, under the leadership of Dr. Rob Mahoney, provided staff and facilities support for the Commission. Dr. Peter Pry provided liaison wi th the Congress. The Commission also benefited from the understanding of EMP ava ilable in foreign institutions. Several gov- ernment, non-profit, and commercial organizat ions conducted work and prepared reports for the Commission. Method The Commission employed a capabili- ties-based methodology to assess potential high-altitude EMP threats to the United States over the next 15 years. 2 To this end it engaged the current Intelligence Com- munity, sponsored the acquisition of new test data and performed analytic studies as input to the independent assessment devel- oped by the Commission. Fifteen years is a very long time horizon. Many develop- ments are possible, to include actions by the United States and others that can shape this future in a vari ety of ways. At the Commission’s inception, Iraq was a state of concern from the standpoint of nuclear proliferation and potential EMP threats. Due to actions taken by the Coalition, such Iraqi capabilities are no long er a current concern. The Commission did not attempt to forecast the relative likelihood of alternative WMD threat scenarios. Instead, it sponsored res earch and reviewed existing assessments to identify the capabilities that might be availa ble to adversaries, with particular emphasis on ballistic missile and nuclear we apons needed for EMP attacks. The Commission’s charter encompassed all ty pes of high-altitude EMP threats. The Commission made a decision to focus most of its efforts on the most feasible of these threats – EMP attacks involving one or a few weapons that c ould cause serious damage to the functioning of the United States as a societ y or result in undermining national support to American forces during a regional contingency. Activities The Commission received excellent support from the Intelligence Community, par- ticularly the Central Intelligence Agency, De fense Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, and Department of Energy Office of Intelligence. National Nuclear Security Administration laboratories (Lawrence Live rmore, Los Alamos, and Sandia), the Navy, and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency pr ovided excellent tec hnical support to the Commission’s analyses. While it benefited from these inputs, the Commission developed an independent assessment, and is solely re sponsible for the content of its research, conclusions, and recommendations in this report.   2 This methodology is addressed in a Commission staff paper — Rob Mahoney, Capabilities-Based Methodology for Assessing Potential Adversary Capabilities, March 2004.   ...a tendency in our plan ning to confuse the unfa- miliar with the improbable. The contingency we have not considered looks strange; what looks strange is therefore improbable; what seems improbable need not be considered seriously. — Thomas C. Schelling, in Roberta Wohl- stetter, Pearl Harbor: Warning and Decision . Stanford University Press, 1962, p. vii "},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Appendix A. The Commission and Its Charter A-3 The Commission also reviewed relevant fore ign research and programs, and assessed foreign perspectives on EMP attacks. In considering EMP, the Commission also ga ve attention to the coincident nuclear effects that would result from a high-altitude detonation that produces EMP, e.g., possible disruption of the operations of, or damage t o, satellites in a range of orbits around the Earth. In addition to examining potential threats, the Commission was charged to assess U.S. vulnerabilities (civilian and military) to EMP and to recommend measures to counter EMP threats. For these purposes , the Commission reviewed re search and best practices within the United States and other countries. Early in this review it be came apparent that only limited EMP vulnerability testing had been accomplished for modern electronic syst ems and components. To partially remedy this deficit, the Commission sponsored illust rative testing of current systems and infra- structure components."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"C RITICAL N ATIONAL I NFRASTRUCTURES Appendix B.
