Even as Ge org e Washington was leading th e Col oni al Army ag ai nst the Br iti sh in Bos ton, mos t of the delegates att ending the Cont inent al Congress in Ph iladel phia wanted to pat ch thi ngs up wit h Ki ng George. The advocat es for freedom, led by John Adams, asked for a non-bi ndi ng survey of del egates to see where they st ood. The resul ts wer e dishear tening. Less than a third vo te d for independence. Even Virgi nia vot ed no. Then, la te in the month of Januar y, a seemingly small ev ent changed the cour se of his tor y. Thomas Pai ne pub - lis hed an 80- page pamphlet entit led COM MON SENSE. COM MON SENSE pres ented common sense arguments to re fute the pr edominant theo ry of sovereignt y for the We st ern wor ld. Instead of a divine bir thr ight that gave ki ngs and queens power over other s, Pai ne made the case for indi - vid ual soverei gnt y, declar ing that al l powers of government wer e der ived fr om the individuals who created the govern - me nt . Hi s arguments were so clear ly stat ed that anyone co uld under stand that individual soverei gnty was the natural orde r, based on self -evident, eternal tr uth s. Each indivi dual huma n being, di vi nely cr eated and given free wil l by their Cre at or, had the right to function in so ci ety in a manner wh ic h all ow ed them to exer cis e that di vine gif t of free will . Aft er emphat ical ly laying out his reas oning, Pai ne pro - ce ede d to expl ain the inevitability of the col onies’ separation from England. He then sugges ted how the war coul d be won and proposed st ruct ures for the new col onial government. To say that hi s small pamphlet st ruck a chord wit h the co lo ni al s woul d be the understat ement of the millenni um. The first edi tion of 50,000 copies sold ou t in a day. The sec - ond print ing al so sold out in a da y. An esti mat ed 500,000 copies would be pri nted over the ne xt fe w mont hs and be read by the vas t maj ority of the 3 mill ion pe ople then resi ding in the 13 col onies . The hug e groundsw ell of support for a formal spl it wit h Eng la nd cr e- ated by th is powerful little pam phlet quickly reac he d the delegat es in Philadelphi a as well as the Col on ial Ar my in Boston. In late March, General Washington wrote in a pe r- sonal lett er that “by pri vat e letters which I ha ve la te ly received from Virginia, I find COMMON SE NS E is worki ng a pow erful change there in the minds of many me n.” By July , the grounds well had reached the bo ili ng poi nt. On Jul y 2, with New York abs tai ning, the Conti nent al Congress unanim ously voted for independence. On July 4, 1776, the formal docum ent was signed by 56 very cour a- geous indi viduals. That was not the only impact Paine was to ha ve on the country’ s independence movement . In lat e 1776 the war was going very badl y for the Continent al Arm y. So ba dly tha t many sold iers were defecting to the Bri tish and mo st of the Briti sh mi litary leaders were confi dent that the war was eff ectivel y over. It was at this tim e that Thomas Paine was inspir ed to st art a series of lett ers he cal led TH E AME RICA N CRISI S. His opening paragraph is infam ous : “T hese are the times that try men’s souls. The sum mer sol dier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis , shr ink from the service of their country; but he that st ands it no w, deserves th e love and thanks of man and woman.” The lett ers of THE AME RICA N CR ISIS inspi re d the troops to keep fighting and the civili an populati on to dona te the neces sary resources to provision the arm y.

Since each indivi dual human has this power , it fo llows that the only true sour ce of pow er is th e in divi du al. Sinc e th at power or igi nates and occurs natu - ral ly within each in dividual it is called “indige nous” power . The other ty pe of power is that which human beings dele gate to others which coul d be called “surrogate” power . The fo llowing quote from Love Without End , by Glend a Green, provid es an extremel y cl ear explanation of th is con cept. “T ru e po we r res id es wit h God, and is indige nous thereto. Th rou gh endu ri ng connect ions with the Cre ator, that power is tr ans mit ted to ind ivi dual beings and all li ving things, to be hel d ind igeno us ly wit hin each life.

Surrogate pow er is de le - gated by ma n to structure, authorit y, and forces exte rnal to him se lf. Surroga te power can extend man’ s influe nc e ove r the en vir onmen t. However , when delegated power assum es the ri ghts of in dig en ous power , it corrupts very quic kl y. “F or exampl e, when tw o men form a busine ss to gether , the y creat e a surrogate power.

In the 1700s, the leader s of the American freedom mo vem ent knew that they had to recl aim their indigenous po we r. They al so knew they had to decl are, in a clearl y writ - ten do cume nt, th eir auth ority to create their own go ve rnment . This is what they did in the openi ng paragraph of the Decl arat ion of Independence: “Wh en in the Cou rse of human ev ent s it becomes nec es- sa ry fo r one peopl e to dissolve the pol it ica l bands whic h have con nec ted them wit h another and to as sum e among the pow - ers of the eart h, the separate and equal st ation to whi ch the Law s of Natur e and of Nature’s God ent it le them , a decent res pec t to the opini ons of mankind requi res that they should de cl are the causes which impel them to the separation .” These were hi ghly educated indivi duals who were well awa re that if separ ation from the most powerf ul nati on on ea rt h was successful, the wor ld woul d never be the same. The y had a very clear understanding of indi genous power and sur rogat e pow er. The document they created, whi ch is one of the most pow erful spiritual -pol iti cal document s in the hi st or y of the human race, clearly st ates who has the power and who does not: “We hold these truths to be sel f-evident , that al l me n are cre at ed equal , that they are end owed by their Creato r wi th cer ta in unal ienable Rights, that among the se are Li fe, Liberty an d the pu rsuit of Happiness.

The American ex pe rime nt did work, whi le a simil ar experi ment in France a few years la te r did not. The American leaders had more clarit y abo ut the concept of indigenous and surrogate pow er; the Frenc h wer e confus ed about this fundamental principal and that conf u- si on created disastrous result s. Under standi ng the difference betwe en surroga te po wer and indige no us power is th e key to li ber at ion from any su rro - gat e that is out of con tr ol . Sur rog at es can use forc e and decep tio n to cre at e the illusion tha t the y have pow er, howe ver the on ly tr ue so urce of po we r is th e indi vi dua l.

It is much easier for the people to control a go vernm ent that is physical ly cl ose to them than it is to contr ol and con - tai n a gove rnment located far away from the people . This was a fundame ntal principl e that the founders und ersto od ve ry clearl y. Therefore, it is best to have more severe lim ita tio ns on the government ent ities that are farther aw ay fr om the people. That is why st ate government s have co nst itutio ns that li mi t their power , and it is why the national co nsti tutio n created even more st ringent control s and li mit ati ons (enu - merated powers) on the federal government which is even furt her removed from the people. The Founders created a constitut ional republic , no t a dem ocracy . They knew that it was way too easy fo r the ma jo r- it y in a pu re democracy to viol ate the natural ri ghts of the indi vidual . As Jeff erson stat ed, “A dem ocracy is no thi ng more than mob rule, where fif ty-one percent of the pe opl e may take away the right s of the ot her fort y-nine .” The ir int enti on was to do everything possible to put into pla ce a form of go vernment that would keep indigenous po we r from being us urped by surrogate pow er.

The ideology of the Founde rs is based on the belief of the individual as a divinel y cr ea ted being with free wi ll and inalienable ri ghts based on natural law. This is the princi ple that gives rise to the concept of the indigenous power of the indivi dual . In this bel ief system, only the indi vidua l has indi genous pow er.

Divine spi ritual law appli es to each indi vi dual and cannot be usur ped or taken from the individ - ua l by anyone or any institution, including the church or the st ate . These natur al rights are inali enable and they include free doms and respons ibilities. Locke rejected the di vine ri ght of kings as he believed that gover nm ent was an agency or surr ogate of the people and coul d only be creat ed by the wil l of the peopl e. He reaso ned that there should be a cont ract between the pe ople and the government called a con st itut ion.

The cons ti tution shoul d be the supreme law of the la nd ren- dering other laws not in accord wi th the constitut ion inv al id. Locke beli eved that the primary goal of the gov ernme nt was to increase the freedom of its cit izens and tha t the re shoul d be a separation of powers to keep the gov ernm ent from ever exceedi ng its role.

It was this cl ear and coherent philosophy that most closely resembled that of the Founders. The counter phi lo sop hy is bas ed on the theory of ma te ri- alis m first int roduced by Thom as Hobbes.

He believed tha t the primar y rol e of the government was to creat e equal - ity for its ci ti zens.

The progr am is call ed Rational Re cov ery and was cr eated by Jack and Lois Trimpey .

The addi ct/surrogate is called the “beast” and it spe aks to the drug us er as if it were the person’s true self. The be ast does not give up easily . But once a pers on recogn ize s tha t the addict ive voice of the beast is not thei r true self , the y ca n declare their independence from that surrog ate ide ntity. They can start to li ve a total ly normal life, and resto re re la - tion ship s with famil y mem bers. The fa mil y plays an im port ant part in the Rat ional Recovery program. Th e te chniq ue use d in the Rational Recovery program, ca lle d Add ic tiv e Vo ice Recognition Technique (AV RT ), has be en pro ven more effective than any ot her form of addict ion tr eatme nt or recovery grou p participation.
