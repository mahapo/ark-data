JESUITS, JEWS AND FREEMASONS T IS IMPOSSIBLE to understand fully what has been t aking place in the world for the past twenty-five years u nless we are able to grasp the underlying significance of what a ppears on the surface. It is necessary to penetrate behind th e scenes of day-to- day happenings and examine thoroughly the active fo rces and planned objectives which are responsible for all th at has come to pass so quickly in the past few years. The 19th century left us deplorably weak in true kn owledge of the history of State-Church conflicts. The facts of human develop- ment since the Reformation have become so inextrica bly tangled, that we have ceased to try to unravel them. We cont ent ourselves in America with a mere superficial knowledge of eve nts, and the conclusions arrived at, far from helping us to get at the real truth, only drive us farther away from an understanding of the real meaning of these events. Too much emphasis has been placed upon the mere economic aspect of the world-situatio n. The ideological and theoretical origins of Nazi-Fascism , as a conse- quence, have been almost entirely overlooked. Resea rch is necessary to show where social, political and religious confl icts cross one another. There is abundance of incontestable proof that the forces of religion, as represented by the Catholic Church, have succeeded in dominating the political and social field, and t hat there exists a close bond between them and the origins, methods an d objectives of the whole Nazi-Fascist movement in Europe. Furth ermore, this domination has already spread to America. History p roves that in every attempt made during the past half century aga inst the liberal progress of mankind, the Jesuit Order, as the leade r of Catholic action, has played a decisive role. We can go even so far as to state that Nazi-Fascism had its origin in the Society of Jesus, and that, like other movements in the past analogous to Fasci sm today, it was planned to serve the traditional aims of the di sciples of Igna- tius Loyola.

T he defenders of democratic ideology will not be victorious until th ey come out openly against their real enemy—the Knights of the Black Crusade. The Jesuits were once irrevocably expelled from the nations of Europe, and from the Catholic Church itself, by Pop e Clement XIV in 1773, and the only refuge they could find during their forty years of banishment was with the impious Catherine of Russia. Sworn to obey and defend the pope in all matters, t hey were hard put to it (even as Jesuits) to find a way out of th e dilemma of being proteges of a monarch who thumbed her nose at the pope— in order to protect them from his wrath. Not to be outdone, the Jesuits politely and diplomatically protested to Ca therine for thus disobeying the pope. And having thereby satisfied t he requirements of their oath, they proceeded with a clear conscien ce to accept her hospitality. The truth of the matter is, that the J esuits are not so much sworn to protect any individual pope as such, but rather the institution of the Papacy. By this Jesuitical disti nction they hold themselves free to resist any pope who fails to fol low their dic- tates; nor would they lament if such a pope were \"p rovidentially\" speeded on his way to heaven. It is they, in fact, who comprise the Papacy. Their unalterable aim is to restore the nat ions of the world to the control of the Catholic Church. As recently as 1886, the public press spoke frankly and fearlessly about the menacing tactics of the Jesuits to secure this world- control by the Papacy. The New York Tribune, of Sep t. 19; of that year, in a dispatch from Rome reporting the serious illness of Pope Leo XIII and his subsequent rapid recovery, states that the London Times referred editorially to the report that Pope Leo's close approach to death \"was due to poison administered b y the Jesuits.\" It relates that, after his sudden recovery, the pop e established a new policy in the Church towards the Jesuits, \"and that this new line of policy is the price at which he was able to proc ure the antidote which they alone could supply.\" The Tribune report goes on to say: \"Within three days of the recovery from his illness , the pope issued a Bull re-establishing all the privileges, immuniti es, exceptions and indulgences formerly accorded to the 'Society of Je suits', and declaring null and void all documents which his predecessors have ever written"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"J ESUITS , J EWS AND F REEMASONS 5 against the order. The fact that Leo XIII restored the order to what it was in the days of its supreme power is more than e nough to paralyze all hopes of a peaceful determination of the confli ct between the Vatican and the Quirinal; for the Jesuits constitute the be lligerent element of Catholicism, and are thoroughly 'intransigent' on t he subject of the tem- poral power of the world escaping from the control of the church . . .\" Far be it from us to doubt the sincerity of the Jes uits and their followers in believing that the control of the worl d by the Catholic Church is the only solution for the ills of mankind . They are wel- come to their conviction, and are free in the Unite d States to propa- gate their teaching and carry out their activities towards that end. The traditional manner in which they carry out thei r designs, how- ever, should be disturbing to all who strive to sus tain the demo- cratic ideology and the principles of freedom and t olerance cher- ished so highly in this country. In order to obtain their objective, they spend all their energies (as Nazi-Fascism does) against the two forces they consider in- imical to their cause—Judaism and Freemasonry. From its first founding, the Jesuit Order has battled, by every me ans, against these two, because they are the chief advocates of tolerance and freedom for all. By the ruthless elimination of Jew s and Free- masons in so many countries of Europe, Nazi-Fascism has merely effected what the Jesuits have schemed and worked f or during many centuries. In France, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Spain, Belgium and Italy, the Jesuits, for many years before Mussolini and Hitler, led the fight against the Jews and Freemasons. In each of these coun- tries it was a Catholic priest (prototypes of Fathe r Coughlin) who was the spearhead of Fascist attacks on both Judais m and Free- masonry. In France it was the Jesuit Father Du Lac, with his Ligue Nationale Anti-semitique de France; in Germany the Jesuit Fathers Overmanns, Muckermann, Loffler and Pachtler; in Hun gary it was Father Adalbert Bangha, and Father Bresciana in Ita ly—all of these worked under the banner of Positive Christian ity and Chris- tian Front to fight Judaism and Freemasonry, in ord er to get the millions of unsuspecting non-Catholics to serve the ir ends. They all proclaimed a crusade for \"The Christian Reforma tion of States"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6 B EHIND THE D ICTATORS and of the World.\" 1 Father Overmanns 2 states that \"the rock of positive moral Christian law\" 3 is the best foundation for the crea- tion of organizations capable of reuniting the memb ers of all Christian religions. Father Hugger, S. J., shortly after the establishme nt of the Ger- man Republic, wrote (in Stimmen der Zeit, June, 191 9, p. 171): \"We are facing a ruinous state of affairs. Once aga in the work of restoration will have to be accomplished by youth. Will the Congrega- tions of Mary not go forth for the third time as th e instrument of recon- struction chosen by Divine Providence?\" Hitler 4 also identified his National Socialist Party with \"Positive Christianity.\" In his Mein Kampf he states that he imbibed his anti-Semitism and his hatred of Masonry from the Ca tholic Chris- tian Social Party of Lueger, then Mayor of Vienna, when he went there as a young man. \"By combatting the Jews,\" he says, \"I am helping the work of the Lord.\" This \"Christian Reform of States\"—which is also the subject of the late Pope's famous encyclical Quadragesimo Anno —is nothing else but the establishment of the Fascist, Corporat ive State, in which neither Jews nor Freemasons will have any par t. Needless to say, it is also anti-Protestant. The Jesuit Fathers Pachder and Muckermann proclaime d the Fascist doctrines of Nazism before Hitler was heard of. Father Muckermann wrote prolifically in favor of racial eu genics and sterilization, 6 and continued to do so even in spite of the condem na- 1 P. Loffler, S.

Jules Michelet, the great French historian, in his Histoire de France, and the German historian Wilhelm Herzog, 7 stress the fact that those who directed the anti-Semitism at t he time of the Dreyfus Affair depended upon the instructions and, above all, upon the financial support of the Jesuits. The Croi x de Feu and the Parti Francais in France, and the Catholic Rexist P arty in Belgium also had the support of the Jesuits. The Libre Paro le, anti-Semitic daily newspaper, was founded by Jesuit money and it s treasury was constantly replenished by them. 8 The anti-Semitic leaders of the Dreyfus Affair, which was a plot against the French Republic, were products of Jesuit schools or had Jesuit confessors . In France, as elsewhere, anti-Semitism and anti-Masonic campaigns took the form of \"integrated Nationalism/' 9 They called for expulsion of Jews and Freemasons, the overthrow of the French Re public, and the setting up of a \"Nationalist State.\" Henlein's Party in Czecho- slovakia, likewise, preached the doctrines of Othma r Spann, the theoretician of the Corporative State and a protege of the Jesuits. One of the first acts of Father (now Monsignor) Jos ef Tiso, when he became Nazi premier of Slovakia, was the destruc tion of all Masonic lodges. In his Mem Kampf Hitler repeats these principles of the Jesuits against Judaism and Freemasonry like a well-trained parrot. All that he says against the Jews and the revolution in Germany after the war, about Zionism, Jewish exploitation of inde cency and obscenity in literature, movies, theater and the pr ess, their part in the organization of vice, prostitution and white sl avery, was bor- rowed almost word for word from the official writin gs of the Jesuits. Everything he says, likewise, against the Freemasons— their fight for religious tolerance, their efforts to break down racial and religious barriers, as well as their alleged di sloyalty to Ger- many during the world war—is in agreement with both the teach- ing of the Jesuits and of the popes in their encycl icals against 7 Der Kampf einer Republik—die Affare Dreyfus, p. 34 , et passim. 8 Cf.

The Jesuit Father Bea, 10 shortly after the revolution in Germany, wrote: \"The part played by many Jews at the time of the re volution . . . the Zionist movement ... all this should be a lesson to those who take their religion and their country seriously to put themsel ves resolutely on the defensive. The increase of anti-Semitic literature and anti-Semitic organizations is evidence that the people are ready for the fight against Judaism.\" As far back as 1911 Father Overmanns, writing in St immen aus Maria Laach, states: \"It is impossible to deny the harmful influence of the Jews \"on the ideal which we desire in our literature. . . . The Jews make use of the great scope of their influence to spread corrupt an d obscene principles and thus cause immense damage to the spiritual life . . . Everyone can see that they create many literary works which are inspired by vile and worldly ideas . . . the hooks of these writers are filled with the base pleasures of life, a vile sensuality and pure natur alism. The commercial sense of the Jews is not offended by the worst obsc enities, white slavery, prostitution and immorality of all kinds . . . \" The popes before Hitler proclaimed all this in even more brutal terms. Pope Pius VII, who restored the Jesuits to t he Catholic Church and the nations of Europe after the downfall of Napoleon in 1814, issued a Bull in 1821 against the Freemaso ns. He calls Freemasonry \"a cancer and a deadly disease of socie ty.\" And the reason he gives is because Masonic Lodges uphold th e idea of religious tolerance: \". . . they receive into their order all classes and all nationalities, and favor all kinds of moral codes and all forms of worship.\" The culminating point in the Vatican's fight agains t Jews and Freemasons is to be found in the encyclicals of Pop es Pius IX-and Leo XIII. Pius IX styles Masonic Lodges \"Synagogues of Satan,\" and accuses them of having fomented wars and revolu tions which put Europe to the fire and the sword. Pope Leo XIII , in his ency- clical Humanum Genus (1884), calls Freemasonry \"a w ork of the devil,\" and \"an impure epidemic.\" He accuses Freema sonry of aiming to destroy the churches, the state, and the public well-being. 10 In Stimmen der Zeit, (Jesuit magazine), 1921, p. 1 72."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"J ESUITS , J EWS AND F REEMASONS 9 He states that among the chief reasons why Freemas ons, and democracy, must be condemned are the following: \"They teach that all men have the same rights, and are perfectly equal in condition; that every man is naturally fre e; that no one has a right to command others; that it is tyranny to ke ep men subject to any other authority than that which emanates from t hemselves. Hence they hold that the people are sovereign, that those who rule have no authority but by the commission and concession of t he people, so that they can be deposed, willing or unwilling, accordin g to the wishes of the people. Thus the origin of all rights and civil duties is in the people or in the State, which is ruled according to the new principles of liberty. They hold that the State must not be un ited to religion, that there is no reason why one religion ought to b e preferred to an- other, and that all must be held in the same esteem .\" He ends his encyclical by inviting all the Catholic clergy as well as the whole lay world to exterminate the Freemason s without mercy. 11 All this was the plan of Mussolini and Hitler as ex pressed and put into practice by Nazi-Fascism. Circumstances ha ve permitted it to go farther than the popes and to carry its princ iples by propa- ganda, invasion and war, into the whole world. In u ndermining the position that Jews and Freemasonry acquired sin ce the French Revolution, it threatens to destroy the entire work of political and religious freedom initiated by the Protestant Refor mation. It thus serves the aims of the Roman Church and the Society of Jesus, founded chiefly for the work of Counter-Reformation . For both Roman Catholicism and Nazi-Fascism regard the ideas that came out of the Reformation and the French Revoluti on as the chief source of the evils of our time—evils which t hey trace for their origins to Rousseau, Calvin, Luther, John Hus s and Wycliffe —to Paris, Geneva, Wittenberg, Prague and London. All of this again is to be found in the \"Protocols of the Elders of Zion.\" An examination of this matter in the next chapter will show conclusively that this infamous forgery is the work of none other than the disciples of Ignatius Loyola. 11 Father Coughlin's magazine, Social Justice, Oct.-X ov. 1939, reiterated all this in a series of three articles entitled Fre emasonry in the Scheme of Satan. They repeat the papal assertions that Freema sonry is allied with the Jews and Communists, and end by calling it, in the words of Pope Pius IX, \"The Synagogue of Satan.\""},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10 B EHIND THE D ICTATORS CHAPTER II. THE JESUITS AND THE PROTOCOLS OF ZION T IS ADMITTED by all intelligent people that the so -called \"Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion\" are criminal fo rgeries, and could never have been written either by a group of Jews or Freemasons. Yet their authorship remains unknown . The amaz- ing part of it is that this fantastic fraud has suc ceeded in its planned objective—the ousting of all Judaic-Masonic influen ce in Central Europe by methods that would bring a blush to the c heek of a Torquemada. The contents of these alleged Protocols are well en ough known, and have been broadcast by Nazi-Fascist (and Roman Catholic) agents in every country as verbatim reports—proces verbaux—of secret conferences at which certain Jewish leaders drew up plans for the formation of an invisible world-government. With the help of Masonic Lodges and the liberal, democratic, soci alist and com- munist parties, these \"Elders of Zion\" are said to have conspired for the overthrow of all non-Jewish governments and to destroy all religions other than Judaism. Every despicable means to weaken Christian institutions is set forth by the imaginar y leaders of this vast conspiracy. All this is to be accomplished principally by means of the Masonic orders throughout the world, as the blind d upes and will- ing tools of this alleged super-imperialism of the Jews.

Universal war against any nation o r group of nations which fails to respond, is planned in Proto col Seven. Pro- tocol Ten contains particulars how all morality is to be undermined and leading statesmen blackmailed, compromised and calumniated in order to force them to serve the ends of the con spirators. The secret conclave, at which these monstrous plans were pur- ported to have been drawn up, is said to have been held under the auspices of \"one of the most influential and mo st highly initi- ated leaders of Freemasonry\"; they are also said to have been \"signed by representatives of Zion of the Thirty-Th ird Degree.\" No group or organization could ever be as evil and satanic as these Judaic-Masonic \"Elders of Zion\" picture thems elves to be. They are the apotheosis of the anti-Christ, and cou ld have been conjured up only by theological minds imbued with t he fearful expectation of the eventual coming of an anti-Chris t. It must be admitted that there, is a certain simila rity between this revolutionary plan of action and the Bolshevis t program that followed the assassination of the Czar of Russia an d the overthrow of the Kerensky regime. But of the seventeen member s of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet govern ment at that time, only one, Trotsky, was a Jew. Neither have th e Masons ever been the least bit influential in Russia, either un der the Czar or the Soviets. A world-wide economic depression also has since happened, somewhat similar to that allegedly planne d by these elders of Zion. By no means, however, have the Jews and Masons ever so completely controlled the world's finances. They suffered as much as others as a result of the economic debac le in 1929. The Nazi-Fascists, who have successfully exploited these Pro- tocols to their great advantage, and who have used these criminal forgeries to attain their primary objective, might well be accused of their authorship. But their publication antedated t he rise of Fas- cism by a quarter of a century, when Hitler and Mus solini were youngsters learning their multiplication tables in school, and Franco babbling his \"Hail Marys\" at his mother's kn ee.

Although first published in Russia in 1903, the Pro tocols of Zion had their origin in France and date from the Dreyfu s Affair, of which the Jesuits were the chief instigators. They were planned also first to take effect in France, by the overthr ow of the \"Judaic- Masonic\" government of the French Republic. But the discovery of the gigantic fraud of Leo Taxil, who had been openl y supported by the Jesuits, the concluding of the Franco-Russia n alliance, along with the Vatican's difficulties with the French gov ernment at that time, made it more opportune to have them appear fi rst in Russia. These Protocols of supposedly Jewish leaders are no t the first documents of their kind fabricated by the Jesuits. For over a hundred years before these Protocols app eared, the Jesuits had continued to make use of a similar frau d called The Secrets of the Elders of Bourg-Fontaine against Jan senism—an anti-Jesuit French Catholic movement among the secu lar clergy. The analogy between the two forgeries is perfect—th e secret assemblage in the forest of Bourg-Fontaine; the pla n of the \"con- spirators\" to destroy the Papacy and establish reli gious tolerance among all nations; the alleged plot against Throne and Altar, and the setting up of a world-government in opposition to the Catholic Church.

Present world trends have convinced Catholic leaders that the time for that Armageddon is fast a pproaching. In their minds there is not the slightest doubt but that ultimate and complete victory will be theirs. Neither have t hey any doubt as to who comprise these forces of Satan.

Obvious forgeries thoug h they are admitted to be, it is safe to say that nothing cont ributed more to the rapid victories of Fascism over the forces of l iberty and toler- ance than these alleged Protocols of the Elders of Zion. As has been pointed out, they insidiously picture world Je wry and Free- masonry as conspiring to establish the reign of Sat an on earth and, by contrast, the Catholic Church as the sole bulwar k and only cer- tain triumphant force against it. As employed by Na zi-Fascism in the past ten years, this fantastic but clever fraud has already suc- ceeded in discrediting democratic institutions of g overnment, even in the United States, and in glorifying the authori tarian rule of force and brutality.

That was all before his conversion to the Catholic Church. It was then that he began to m ake alleged revelations about the Freemasons, and published a l arge number of books about them, each more astounding than the other. Sensing the Catholic Church's demon complex, Taxil played this up with consummate art. In his many novels, wh ich were published by the Catholic press all over the world, Taxil stressed the cult of Demonism, or what he called Satanisme. He pictured the Freemasons as practising this worship of the de vil, and accused them of assassinations, sexual orgies and white sla very.

As proof that Freemasonry was secretly controlled b y the Jews, he revealed their alleged practices of Jewish rituals. The Catholic clergy everywhere were especially deli ghted with Taxil's sinister novel Palladismus, the story of Di ana Vaughan who, according to him, was the result of the union of her mother with a devil named Bitron. These fantastic revelati ons convinced many that the Catholic hierarchy were in direct con tact with this daughter of the devil through the intermediary of L eo Taxil, now their protege.

In this system each individual, like a cell in a body, must humbly sub- mit to his fate and occupy his \"natural place\" whic h is allotted to him from birth and have no desire to get away from it. This basis of social structure is not only anti-Jewish, but al so anti-Protestant. It corresponds exactly to the system of the Jesuit Order itself as founded by Ignatius Loyola, the essential point of which consists in an hierarchical structure of ideas, and is chara cteristic of all Catholic political thought. 4 The hierarchical, as opposed to the Protestant democratic system, holds that the differ ent races con- stitute the hierarchical steps in a cosmic system w hich no one has the right to change or modify either by individual or collective will. The Jesuit Father Muckermann, in his many works on race hygiene, fully explains this ideology which is at t he basis of all the aims and acts of Nazi-Fascism. Mixture of races, he holds, pro- duces \"inharmonious\" descendants who have difficult y in allowing themselves to be absorbed into a national unity. It is well known that mixture of races brings forth strong individua lities; and these in the Jesuit view, would disrupt the static \"harmo ny\" they desire among peoples and nations, as well as nullify the g regarious in- stinct which the Jesuits endeavor to foster. In the ir view \"harmony\" is a state where each one places himself humbly and voluntarily in the organic niche appointed for him by the supreme authority without any \"diabolic inharmonious\" desire to leave it. This is the way the Jesuit Order itself is built up, and this i s the ideal Catholic aim for states and groups of states in the politica l and social order. It is the organic, static, hierarchical, integralis t, corporative system of Nazi-Fascist teaching, which is already in effec t in many coun- tries of Europe. It is in direct opposition to the disintegralist, dynamic, liberal, free, democratic concept of polit ical and social order. 4 Cf.

The Jesuit party has long feared the infilt ration of Protes- tant and liberal ideas into the German Catholic min d. During the post-war years, when Germany was a democratic repub lic, many of the ordinary secular clergy and some of the reli gious orders became enamored of the liberal, secularizing spirit . They formed the backbone of the Catholic Centre Party—which was the last bulwark against Hitler's rise to power. But this la st element of liberalism in Germany was dissolved by order of Pop e Pius XI, as a stipulated condition of the Vatican's concordat w ith Nazism; its leader, Klausener, was assassinated in the \"blood p urge\" of June 30, 1934. The last liberal party in Italy also, hea ded by the exiled priest Don Sturzo, shared the same fate at the hand s of the same Pope Pius XI. It is nothing new in Catholic history that religious and social reformers from within the Church should be the first to suffer its enmity.

THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND THE CORPORATIVE STATE FEW YEARS AGO, Americans considered it incredible that the Catholic Church could be officially in fav or of the Fascist corporative state; much less that it could have been in any way responsible for the origin and spread of Corporatism. They refused to believe that the vaunted encyclical Quadragesimo Anno, of Pope Pius XI, was an endorsement of the Na zi-Fascist objective to discredit and destroy the structure of the liberal demo- cratic state, and to set up, in its stead, authorit arian, hierarchical regimes. Yet, this encyclical embodied the whole ai m of the Catho- lic Church for half a century before the rise of Fa scism, namely, the total reconstruction of the then existing socia l order on Catho- lic-Fascist lines. The real title of this encyclica l is: \"On the Recon- struction of the Social Order,\" and its plan is act ually the ecclesias- tical counterpart of the Fascist military onslaught against liberal- ism and democracy. Americans heard Father Coughlin preach this for eig ht years, but merely shrugged their shoulders and took it for granted that his rantings were those of a crackpot and had nothi ng to do with the true aims and activities of the Catholic Church . It can now be seen that this plan of the Vatican, though camoufla ged in terms to quiet the fears of Americans, was being carried forward officially by the Catholic Church in the United States as vigo rously as in European countries. In our first issue of The Converted Catholic Magazi ne, 1 atten- tion was directed to the plan as published under th e auspices of the National Catholic Welfare Conference, and signe d by 131 Catholic prelates and noted laymen.

In spite of this, however, this plan of the Catholi c Church says: \"Had the NRA been permitted to continue, it could r eadily have developed into the kind of industrial order recomme nded by the Holy Father.\" So cautiously had this plan been advanced in the Un ited States, that it was not until the Roman Catholic hierarchy, in 1940, issued its pronouncement on \"The Church and the Social Ord er\" 3 that the press could safely headline the news that \"The Catholic Hier- archy Advocates Corporative System for the U.

And even now, when patriotic Americans are turning the searchlight of suspicion on every sign of political and economic subversion, the greatest Trojan Horse of them all continues to tower unmolested in the ve ry shadow of their searchlights. In newspaper offices, this Troj an Horse of Jesuit Catholicism is still regarded as the feared and unt ouchable \"sacred cow.\" The misconception that the corporative system is pu rely an economic matter, has blinded the American press and public to the real aim behind Catholicism's advocacy of it. Corpo ratism is indeed the economic ingredient of Fascism. But it is also the essential ele- ment of Fascism, since the corporatives make a parl iament or con- gress unnecessary. For these corporatives are the m eans through which the \"Leader\" exercises his dictatorial will. It was precisely because the Supreme Court judged that, by the NRA, Congress had abdicated its powers and was thus paving the way fo r Fascism, that it took vigorous action against it. The entire ideology of Fas- cism and Nazism—in social, economic, educational, r eligious and military' matters—is contained in the corporative s ystem. Corpor- atism is Fascism. 2 Cf. John T.

The following is a sample: \"Let us see, for example, how interesting are some of the objectives of the National Socialist program: popular unity as opposed to every- thing that can disrupt; language as the nation's sp iritual bond; con- sciousness of Germany's historical destiny; the sen timent of race consciousness; the attempt to solve the Jewish ques tion; assurance of pure German breeding; destruction of parties; cultu re of the family, and the ideal of the large family considered as a matte r of honor and national pride; the militarization of the nation . . . ; a new system of instruction and education; the corporative idea; th e aristocratic princi- ple of government by a Leader. . . .

In order to prove the identity of interests between Catholicism and Nazi Socialism, Bishop Hudal 5 quotes from the Catholic Ger- man historian, Joseph Lortz of Minister, who, in hi s work, History of the Churches, 6 shows that Catholicism and Nazi-Socialism agree on the following points: \"1. Both are mortal enemies of Bolshevism, Liberali sm, and Relativ- ism, that is to say, of the three deadly maladies f rom which our age is suffering, and which fiercely attack the work of the Church. The essential ideas of Nazi Socialism, together with th e principle of liberty bound to authority, correspond exactly to the ideas that Popes Gregory and Pius IX endeavored to impose upon the 19th cent ury, in face of a world which called itself progressive, and which re ceived their teachings with sarcastic smiles.

The Catholic bishops in the United States cannot afford to be as frank in supporting Nazi-Fascist id eology in this country. They cannot but admit, however, that their fellow-bishops in Nazi-Fascist countries have been correct in thei r analysis of the benefits which this anti-liberal and anti-democrati c ideology will bring to the organization of Roman Catholicism. 7 Franz von Papen, a papal Knight and Hitler's most successful hench- man, declared in Der Volkischer Beobachter of Janua ry 14, 1934: \"The Third Reich is the first power which not only recognizes, but which puts into practice the high principles of the Papacy.\""},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"36 B EHIND THE D ICTATORS CHAPTER VII. THE GREATEST TROJAN HORSE OF THEM ALL CLEVER MASQUERADE has always been characteristic of the political activities of Jesuit Catholicism. Jesuitry is a word in all our dictionaries that is defined as s ynonymous with subtle duplicity, indirection and disingenuous ness. History is witness to the undeniable fact that the Jesuit Orde r, founded in 1540 for the express purpose of counter-Reformation , has excelled in the art of Machiavellian duplicity. 1 It is an organization founded on military lines to fight for the political restor ation of the Roman Papacy, and is the only order in the Catholic Churc h that binds its members by special oath for this purpose. It uses t he deep-seated religious needs of the human heart in order to carr y out a plan which is patently political and reactionary from th e point of view of social matters. This is a fact that must be borne in mind today in order to under- stand what is behind the onslaughts of what is know n as Nazi- Fascism against the liberal constitutions of Protes tant democratic countries. Present-day events appear as a mass of c ontradictions and confused paradoxes which, if they are to be ful ly understood, require a most acute analysis. In order to uncover the real forces which are playing for high stakes in the game, it i s not sufficient to examine the mere surface of things as they happe n.

Americans will never win out against it unless and until they brin g to light the activating forces set in motion, long before Mussol ini and Hitler, for the express purpose of arresting and eventually destroying the progress that followed upon the Protestant Reformat ion and the American and French Revolutions. Nazi-Fascism is no t merely \"Kaiserism with bad manners.\" It is the spearhead o f a hidden force which set out long ago to impose a new ideolo gy upon the post-Reformation world. Religion, which has always been used by ambitious o ppressors to serve the ends of their political power, is the mask to conceal their scheme of action. Although religion is the mo st sacred of man's needs, it is the easiest and most effective c loak to hide a poisoned dagger from an enemy. It has always been u sed by politi- cal Catholicism as a Trojan horse with all the appu rtenances of war safely concealed within its flanks. This is esp ecially the case in liberal democratic countries like the United Sta tes, where a wealthy and powerful organization like the Church o f Rome is safeguarded not only against open attack but even a gainst mild and just criticism. American tolerance, leaning bac kwards, has forced a rigid policy on leading newspaper offices and bureaus of public information to treat the Church of Rome as a \"sacred cow.\" Just as the Trojans unsuspectingly accepted the mys terious horse thrust within their gates by the wily Greeks, so to o has America stood in awe of the \"sacred cow\" of Catholicism and has never dared even to question its presence. Americans are justly fearful of being accused of religious bigotry and intoleran ce, since they have long prided themselves as guaranteeing religio us liberty and freedom of expression to all comers.

Its real aim and purpose, however, can be known only by an examinati on of its activities before and since the rise of Fascism. The Jesuits take a solemn oath to fight a crusade f or \"Catholic restoration,\" the success of which has always depen ded first on the complete destruction of Protestantism and its i ncreasing liber- alizing effects on political and social life for th e past four hundred years. For it was Protestantism that undermined the political power of the papacy in the past. It made religion a matte r of individual choice; it liberated the individual from the author itarianism of kings and popes; it freed the civil state from eccl esiastical inter- ference; it caused non-Catholic governments to deny outright the vital claim of the Church of Rome to be, by divine right, a uni- versal, independent entity and superior to all othe r forms of gov- ernment; it took away from the Church of Rome direc t control over all the institutions that go to make up the li fe of man—mar- riage, education, charitable, cultural and recreati onal activities. It is now accused by Catholic spokesmen as being th e instigator of communism and atheism and the ally of world Jewry a nd Free- masonry. Space permits only a very brief summary of the coun ter-Reforma- tion activities of Jesuit Catholicism which led to the rise and pres- ent successes of Nazi-Fascism against the liberaliz ing effects of the Protestant Reformation. The Thirty Years War, t he murderous reign of the Duke of Alva in the Netherlands, the m assacre of St. Bartholomew and the bloody attempts at Catholic res toration in England, are visible, and terrifying examples of th e anti-Protestant activities of the Jesuit Order in the past. It was they who instigated the Dreyfus Affair as a means to overthrow the Fren ch Republic and thus nullify the effects of the French Revoluti ons of 1789 and 1848.

His use of brute force against all opposing convictions and philosophi- cal opinions is the result of the fact, as he says, 3 that \"I made a rigorous analysis of analogous cases which are to b e met with in history, especially in the domain of religion.\" But it was not until after \"World War I that the ac tive plan for Catholic restoration began to take shape. Befor e the coming of Pope Pius XI, in 1922, the Catholic church had b een forced into a more or less defensive position towards the liberal spirit of modern times. But with the election of this admitte dly pro-Jesuit and pro-Fascist pope, Mussolini and Hitler also app eared on the scene, and in combination with them the Catholic ch urch took the offensive. The following, from the historical work of Karl Boka, 4 an ardent supporter of Catholic restoration, is to the point: \"At this decisive moment the Pope seized the reins and took into his hands the unified control of all fields of endeavor in which his predes- cessors had distinguished themselves.

And this interventio n had for its end the destruction of the liberal spirit of the 19th centu ry and the triumph of the Christian Idea.\" Since then we have witnessed Catholicism's open sup port of every step taken by Nazi-Fascism to impose authoritarian regimes upon all peoples: its active cooperation in the systemat ic oppression exercised by the Fascist regime in Italy itself; it s secret agreement with Hitler's National Socialism (the Vatican was t he first to rec- ognize Hitler's regime); its support of Mussolini's shameful con- quest of Ethiopia and even of Japan's invasion of C hina; its open 2 In his book, The Church and the State, p. 132. pub lished before the first world war in England, when he was professor of Cano n Law at Dutton Hall. 3 Cf.

The owning classes, whos e liberalism was less an expression of ideal convictions than of material inter- ests, were gripped with the fear of the growth of s ocialism under the Weimar Republic. By clever propaganda, Roman Ca tholic forces succeeded in convincing them that an hierarc hical church was their best protection against the attacks of th e \"lower classes.\" On the other hand, they used the anti-liberalism of German socialists to prove to these latter that political Catholicism and the socialist movement, both opponents of this libe ralism, could form a solid basis for common action in the domain of political action. The coalition between the Social-Democrats and the Catholic Center Party was the result of this maneuver; in re ality it was an unconscious submission of the former to Jesuit Cath olicism, which was thus enabled to use Catholic democratic politic ians and the anti-Jesuits for its own ends. It was so cleverly d one that the real aim of the Jesuits was not realized until Pope Pius XI dissolved the Catholic Center Party and thus left the way cle ar for Hitler's rise to power. In all this, Hitler had the cooperat ion of Monsignor Kaas, the real head of the Catholic Center Party. T he role played by former Chancellor Briining, the political leader of the Party, is as obscure as that of his ill-fated colleague Schus chnigg.

NAZI SOCIALISM AND CATHOLIC RESTORATION ATHOLIC ACTION, instituted by Pope Pius XI, is a ge neric term for Catholic reform and reconstruction—the res tora- tion of Catholicism to the position of authority wh ich it held over the nations before the Reformation. It ha s a two-fold object: a purge of liberal elements within the chur ch itself, and the complete destruction of Protestantism and its l iberalizing effects in those countries which threw off the yoke of the papacy in the past. Catholic Action was brought into being coinci dentally with the rise of Nazi-Fascism, and was later consolidate d by the Lateran Pact with Mussolini in 1929, and by the concordat w ith Nazi Socialism in 1933. It gained its objectives to a la rge extent in Europe through the military might and fifth column methods of its Nazi-Fascist partner. It can be safely said that Nazi-Fascism and Jesuiti sm, the two greatest reactionary forces in the world today, are but two facets of the same unity—one civil, and the other ecclesia stical. For an authoritarian civil State cannot function properly without the help of an authoritarian ecclesiastical system. It is no netheless true, though not sufficiently recognized, that a free ele ctoral State is impossible without the spiritual support and nouris hment of a free church. Nazi-Fascism's anti-Semitic ideology, its anti-Maso nic and anti- democratic activities, its propaganda methods, the hierarchical structure of its organization, and even its war pro gram, were copied from the Jesuit Order. The crusades of the Middle A ges also began with persecution of the Jews, and were preceded by a purging within the church itself. Likewise a brutal cleansi ng within Catholi- cism preceded the wars of religion instigated by th e Jesuits in the 16th and 17th centuries. Its object was to rid Cath olicism of the heretical Protestant influences which had arisen wi thin the church's organization before and after Martin Luther's time. It is in the light of these events that Nazi Socialism's fight w ith all the churches in Germany must be regarded.

On the other hand, it was a fight against Prot estantism and its liberal institutions which had been afforded still greater scope for development after the fall of the monarchy in 1918. The fight was carried out, in both instances, according to the tr aditional methods of Jesuit strategy. Many Americans, however, do not see it in this ligh t. They think only of the fact that the Hitler regime in th e beginning interned Catholic priests in concentration camps be cause they re- fused to obey his dictates; that heads of religious orders were brought to trial for smuggling money out of the cou ntry; that some of the members of religious orders were arrest ed and found guilty of crimes against morals; that some priests were imprisoned for allegedly harboring communists; that the Hitler ites turned against Cardinal Faulhaber, Cardinal Innitzer and t he Bishop of Salzburg; that public school education was taken ou t of the hands of the priests in Austria; that the Catholic Center Party was anni- hilated and its members persecuted; that its leader , Dr. Klausner, was assassinated on June 30, 1934, in Hitler's \"blo od purge.\" These and other facts are at times cited to show th at Nazi Socialism seems to be actively opposed to the Catholic Church . They are, however, merely facts whose real significance is hi dden beneath the surface. In reality, they are not indications o f a war against the Catholic Church as a whole, but only against certai n groups op- posed to a corresponding plan of reconstruction and Fascist regi- mentation instituted at the same time by Pope Pius XI within the church itself.

In order, therefore, to understand fully th e status of the Catholic Church in relation to Nazi Socialism it is necessary to know the details of these opposing tendencies and f orces within the church's organization. History alone can furnis h the key to the mystery. An outstanding Catholic historian, Josef Schmidlin, draws a clear picture of the different factions which exist ed within the Catholic Church towards the end of the 19th century , and how victory for the intransigent Jesuit party led to th e rise of Fascism. The following, from his History of the Popes of Mod ern Times, 1 is to the point: \"The history of the Popes during the 19th century p resents a succession of divergent systems following each othe r like a game of opposites and of warring forces striving for the ma stery, with first one side winning and then another. On one side are the zealots striv- ing in an intransigent and intolerant manner to pre serve fixed tradi- tions and orthodoxy, and who take a hostile attitud e towards the progress of modern civilization and the liberal vic tories that fol- lowed on the great revolutions, which are the unrem itting enemies of the [Catholic] Church, the State and the principle of authority. On the other side are the liberals who, actuated by a more equitable political sense, endeavor to break free from the tr aditional restraints bound up with the ideas of old, and who try to reco ncile themselves with modern progress in order to live in peace with liberal states and governments, and to integrate the church, as a spir itual force, in contemporary civilization. \"From the beginning this war-like game of opposites has been going on within the Roman Curia, and especially wit hin the College of Cardinals. It is most evident in the papal concl aves which become the stage for this play of divergent tendencies, wh ich are afterwards openly expressed in the attitudes of successive pon tiffs. For the popes support one or the other of these tendencies and pe rsonify them by the conduct of their internal and foreign policies after mounting the papal throne.\" Thus it can be seen that the Catholic Church has be en torn be- tween two main irreconcilable factions, correspondi ng to the two opposing ideologies of Fascism and Democracy, which are war- ring to the death at present all over the world.

They showed themselves skeptical of relic and saint wor- ship and of religious sentimentalities in general. Moreover, they made no secret of their hostility to the Jesuits. T he Benedictine Order, long ante-dating the Jesuits, greatly angere d the latter by their efforts in promoting what is known as the \"Li turgical Move- ment\"—a return to Evangelical Christianity and an a ttempt to cleanse Catholic worship of modern innovations and superstitions, such as wonder-working devotions to the saints. The y aimed this especially at the Jesuits' pet devotion of the \"Sac red Heart,\" which has since been outdone, however, by more modern fad s like the Little Flower devotion. The Jesuits fought back by their usual underhand methods of playing on the fears of bishop s and secular priests and even by sending members of their order, disguised as laymen, to spy on the Benedictines, as was done at the Benedictine Abbey of Maria Laach near Cologne. A severe blow to the hopes of liberal Catholic grou ps was the Syllabus of Errors decreed by Pope Pius IX at Jesui t insistence. One of these \"errors,\" in particular, fairly took t he ground from under the feet of those who had striven for a more progressive and liberal Catholicism. In complete accord with tradit ional Jesuit in- transigence, Pope Pius IX solemnly condemned the pr oposition that \"the Roman Pontiff can and ought to reconcile himself to, and agree with, liberalism and modern civilization. \" The history of the Catholic Church entered a new ph ase with the proclamation of the dogma of the personal infal libility of the pope, which was also railroaded through the Vatican Council (1870) by the machinations of the Jesuits. This was the severest blow of all to the liberal elements, and certain gr oups hostile to the Jesuits followed Doellinger out of the church a nd established themselves as the Catholic Christian Church. But th e vast majority of those who had fought the Jesuits and opposed the dogma of in- fallibility bowed their heads and submitted with re signation.

In order to prevent the news of the increasingly bitter cont roversies waged at papal conclaves from reaching the public, Pope P ius XI imposed an oath of perpetual silence on everyone connected with them in the future. All these developments paved the way for the Vatica n's ecclesi- astical support for the coming Fascism. There follo wed a rapidly increasing trend in Catholic action in favor of rig orously authori- tarian, conservative and solely hierarchical polici es. Apparent yielding to contrary policies in democratic countri es did not in any way affect Rome's fixed goal. It merely served to h elp its attain- ment, since it was able to employ what are now know n as fifth column methods by using to its own purposes freedom of speech and religious tolerance in those countries. Once de mocracy and freedom of speech have been obliterated by military might, as in Nazi-Fascist controlled countries in Europe, the re al authoritarian and intolerant nature of Jesuit Catholicism comes t o light. It imme- diately proclaims itself the ecclesiastical counter part of civil dicta- torship. What has happened in France since its capi tulation to Hitler and Mussolini is a clear case of this. Likew ise in Germany the Catholic bishops in 1940 decreed a solemn oath of loyalty to Nazi Socialism, 4 and in Slovakia in the same year the governmental structure of that country was publicly and official ly declared to be a combination of Nazi Socialism and Roman Catholici sm.

By the selection of the aristocratic, conservative Cardinal Pacelli as Pius XII, that hop e was forever frustrated. The Fascist policies of the Vatican can be seen fro m the follow- ing four points: 1. In the application of \"modern\" methods of political action, that is, fascist methods, 2. In the opposition to the one-time Catholic (popular ) political parties. 3. In the distrust of the lower clergy, because of its too tolerant attitude toward pre-Fascist ideas of individual rig hts and liberties. 4. In the creation of a movement of restoration, Catho lic Action, entirely dependent upon Vatican bureaucracy. Much of the mystery of Vatican relations with Nazi- Fascism can thus be solved. Persecution of the Catholic Chu rch in Germany has been directed only against those elements which did not en- tirely submit to the ever-increasing centralization of authority in Church and State. To this end the Vatican helped to crush out the Catholic popular parties both in Italy and Germany and centralized all political matters in Rome. This insured to the dictators freedom from popular interference on the part of Catholics; it established a more complete dictatorial regime within the Catho lic Church itself; it enabled the Vatican to enter into secret concordats with fascist countries already existing, and with democr atic countries, like Spain, France, Belgium and Portugal, after the destruction of their democratic governments by revolution and blit zkrieg.

HITLER'S FIGHT AGAINST THE CHURCHES HE FULL STORY of the rise of Nazi-Fascism has still to be written. When it appears it will surprise most Amer icans to discover the part played in it by the Christian Chu rches— Protestant as well as Catholic. For Nazi-Fascism wa s as much a product of the Churches as of the State, and a move ment towards religious as well as political and social authorita rianism. European Catholic historians immediately recognized it as th e final act in the Jesuit plan of counter-Reformation instituted e xactly four hundred years before—in 1940. Americans will never fully understand the real aims and activi- ties of the Church of Rome so long as they continue to look at Catholicism from our American point of view. On thi s side of the Atlantic attention has been focussed mainly on attempts of a few \"liberal\" Catholic spokesmen to integrate their Church with the American way of life. These are sincere in thin king that Catho- lic authoritarianism can be reconciled with the lib eral, tolerant principles of American democracy. 1 But the Church of Rome has its roots in Europe; there its metaphysic was first established. It is therefore to its background and activities in Europ e we must look if we want to judge what its real nature is. It is the policy deter- mined upon \"beyond the Alps\" in Europe that directs and guides the Catholic Church even in America. Well-meaning C atholic spokesmen in the democracies are permitted to voice their liberal views, but their wishful thinking has never had any effect in really bringing the Catholic Church into line with our Ame rican demo- cratic way of life. This issue has been bitterly fought out in Europe b etween Nazi- Fascism and the Christian churches. As far as Europ e is concerned the fight is ended—with victory on the side of Nazi -Fascism and Catholic ultramontanism. In Italy, Spain, Austria, Poland, Portu- gal, France and Belgium, Catholicism alone was invo lved. In Germany, however, both the Protestant and Catholic Churches 1 Cf. for example, the article of Rev. John F. Croni n, S. S., Rome—Ally of Democracy! in the magazine Common Sense for Octo ber, 1940.

There the strug gles were as bit- ter, and purges as bloody, within the Churches as w ithin the State. They were more severe and bloody within Protestanti sm than Catholicism; many more liberal Protestant leaders t han Catholic were liquidated or put out of the way in concentrat ion camps. By- refusing to make any concessions to Nazism, the Eva ngelical Prot- estant Churches are said to have actually paved the way for the success of the \"German Christian\" movement. These \" German Christians\"—Protestant Fascists—professed to consid er it neces- sary to submit to a spiritual leader in order to fr ee Protestantism of liberalism and rationalism. They thus became one with the Catholic Fascists who, in keeping with the Catholic Action crusade of Pope Pius XI, were purging every taint of libera lism and democ- racy out of the Catholic clergy and were bringing t he Catholic Church in Germany into line with pure Vatican absol utism. Gon- zague de Reynold, ardent Jesuit Catholic reformer, in his book L'Europe Tragique, 2 states: \"A real fight has been waged within Protestantism. The Evangelical Protestants refused to make any concessions and est ablished a confes- sional church in opposition to that set up by the s tate . . . We are on the threshold of a religious schism. These are the final repercussions of the Reformation. We are witnessing a phase of disso lution [of Protes- tantism]. Many German Protestants believe that to r eject a purely religious authority like the Papacy, would constitu te a danger to the church and to Christianity.\" In order to understand what happened to the Catholi c Church in Germany, it is necessary to go back to the time of Pope Leo XIII, well known for his unrelenting antagonism to the li beral constitu- tions of states. 3 In order to counteract the increasing influence of 19th century liberalism on Catholic countries, Pope Leo XIII urged on Catholic leaders throughout the world the format ion of Catho- lic political parties. He thought that if such Cath olic parties took an active part in parliamentary politics they would , by securing the balance of power, succeed in obtaining victory for the Church. He even hoped that these Catholic political parties wo uld eventually obtain a large enough majority, by democratic means , to enable 2 P. 329. 3 Cf.

What actually happened, however, was the very opposite. The Catho lic parties gradually came under the influence of their liberal opponents and copied many of their ideas. Thus in Italy the Catho lic party became the \"popular\" liberal party headed by the now-exile d priest Don Sturzo; in Germany it became the liberal \"Center\" p arty. This liberal influence of Catholic parties became s o great that the Holy See began to regard Catholic political tre nds as a grave danger which actually threatened the juridical and political unity of the Church itself. These Catholic parties became infiltrated with the liberal spirit of the French Revolution of 1789 . The ideas of the rights of man, of religious tolerance, of freed om of conscience, of speech and press, were adopted by a great number of Catholic politicians and by many of the lower clergy. So pronounced had this trend of popular Catholic po litics be- come in the United States, for instance, that when Alfred E. Smith was nominated for the Presidency in 1928, the Vatic an and Catho- lic bishops in Europe were shocked to hear that Mr. Smith had been prompted by priests to proclaim these principl es to be, not a mere matter of \"favor\" (as he first stated) but als o a matter of \"innate right.\" 4 This was rank heresy, and, after Mr. Smith's defea t at the polls in 1928, the Vatican rebuked those who had advised the former Governor of New York to proclaim doctrin es so con- trary to official Catholic teachings. By the end of the First World War, the Catholic pol itical parties had begun to lose the importance which they had, in the eyes of the Vatican when it first brought them into being. They became so integrated with democratic States, founded as they were on political compromise, on tolerance and the idea of equality, that it was con- fusing to note the alliances made by some Catholic parties with bourgeois groups and by others with socialist group s. It had become apparent that the control of Catholic politics was being lost by the Holy See in Rome. Pope Leo XIII's plan had miscarri ed, and had proved a boomerang against the real aims of the Chu rch as he had proclaimed them. Catholic political action had acqu ired an inde- 4 Cf. Alfred E.

Liberal Catholicism, in fact, which, to all appearance, had received its death-blow by the decr ee of papal infallibility towards the end of the 19th century, had taken on a new lease of life by means of the very Catholic pol itical parties which had been established and sustained by Pope Le o XIII to oppose the hated liberal constitutions of democrati c States. This is how the Vatican saw it after the First Worl d War, and the conclusions which it drew from its observations in the matter were the first steps towards the rise of what we no w call Fascism. Many of the non-Jesuit religious orders in Germany, notably the Franciscans and the Benedictines, started movem ents which dis- pleased the Vatican. The \"Liturgical Movement\" of t he Benedic- tines; their attempt to establish contact with the Oecumenical Evangelical Movement, and their effort towards a re union of all Christian Churches; the attitude of the Patres Unio nis (\"Fathers of Unity\") who were even prepared to modify the dogmas of papal infallibility and the Immaculate Conception in orde r to help their work of reunion; their open and secret negotiations with groups in the Anglican Church under the guidance of the la te Cardinal Mercier—all these liberal reform movements were reg arded as tainting the lower clergy and the intelligent laity with the heresy of liberalism and Protestantism. The Vatican regard ed its authority as gravely menaced by it all, and determined to wag e relentless war against this growing liberalism in political and sp iritual matters. It should not be surprising that Rome became distur bed at the prospect of a revival of the Lutheran Reformation. It was particu- larly marked in Germany. Friedrich Heiler 5 has the following to say on this point: \"These recent tendencies of Catholicism have spread to a great extent in Germany. German Catholicism is in fact a particular kind of Catholicism, due to the fact that it has been subje ct, continually if not visibly, to the influence of the reformed churc hes of Christendom, and has constantly absorbed certain features belong ing to Evangeli- cal Christianity.\" But the democratic States were the most powerful in the world 5 Professor at the University of Marburg, in his wor k, Im Ringen um die Kirche, p. 175 et seq."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"54 B EHIND THE D ICTATORS at that time. The Catholic political parties had be come too strong to be stopped by mild protests or even by encyclica l letters from Rome. Repressive action, carried out by the help of authoritarian secular regimes, was necessary. Thus the two great opposing fac- tions within the Catholic Church became locked agai n in a gigantic struggle: one possessing the Evangelical Catholic i dea, deep-seated as of old in the hearts of true Christian believers ; the other, the coldly imperial, sectarian and intransigent Roman P arty, repre- sented by the Holy See under the domination of the Society of Jesuits. It is in the light of these facts that Hitler's \"ca mpaign against the churches\" must be viewed. Neither Hitler nor th e Jesuits could forgive priests and bishops in Germany who sided wi th the cause of liberalism and democracy during the Weimar Repub lic. It was against them that the acts of Catholic repression w ere directed. Hitler and Pope Pius XI acted in concert to destroy every vestige of liberalism in Germany: the one in social and pol itical life, the other in the sphere of religion. By dissolving the Catholic Center Party, the Pope removed the last obstacle to Hitler 's rise to power, and also deprived the Catholic people and clergy in Germany of any say-so in political matters. He had done the sa me for Mussolini in Italy by the dissolution of the Partito Popolare and the exiling of its priest-leader Don Sturzo. By his Catholic Ac tion he concen- trated all Catholic political power in the Holy See . Thenceforth, the Vatican was free to make arbitrary concordats w ith the Fascist dictatorships. The lower clergy in Germany did not yield without a struggle. Many defied both Hitler and the Pope. Some priests were im- prisoned. Even when the pristine ardor of Cardinal Innitzer for Hitler and Nazi Socialism showed signs of cooling, hostility was engineered against him. Catholic schools, mostly un der the care of liberal, non-Jesuit religious orders, were close d; some heads of these anti-Jesuit religious orders were punished fo r attempting to save their funds by smuggling them out of the count ry.

There were some mild protests from Rome but no adverse action. Even the closing of Catholic schools in Austria went almost unprotested .

The Nazi-Vatican concordat continues to hold and function. With the extinction of liberal Catholicism and the imprisonment of liberal Protestant leaders, Vatican absolutism w as triumphant. Of supreme satisfaction to the Jesuit Catholic fact ion was the knowledge of the apparent dissolution of Protestant ism in Ger- many, and the fact that the pro-Nazi Protestant \"Ge rman Chris- tians\" were forced to realize, as Gonzague de Reyno lds points out, that \"to reject a purely religious authority like t he papacy would constitute a danger to the Church and Christianity. \""},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"56 B EHIND THE D ICTATORS CHAPTER X. NATIONAL SOCIALISM AND CATHOLIC ACTION ATHOLIC ACTION—the crusade for Jesuit-Catholic Re- form—has the following characteristics: 1. Its direction, as laid down in Pope Pius XI's Encyc lical Quadra- gesimo Anno, is explicitly entrusted to the Society of Jesus. 2. Its aims are: the extermination of the hated libera l spirit of the 19th century; the formation of a world crusade agai nst socialism and communism; the success of the counter-Reformation. 3. The means to obtain these ends are: the annihilatio n of the old Catholic political parties, which became impregnate d with the \"demo- cratic ideology, and the purging of the secular cle rgy, the religious orders and the laity in so far as they persist in h olding to non-Jesuit opinions in matters of ecclesiastical policy. 4. The most suitable political regime to assure the su ccess of this crusade for Catholic reconstruction is the hierarch ical, authoritarian form of the Fascist state or of Nazi Socialism. The secular clergy of the Catholic Church in German y and other European countries have always secretly fostered a democratic tradition, and for many years considered it their p rincipal task to live in peace with Protestantism and the liberal in stitutions of the modern world. For this reason they constituted the chief obstacle in the way of the Catholic Reconstruction Movement initiated by the late Pope Pius XL They were not friendly to the idea of the corporate state, to the plan of the new crusade, no r to the Vatican's aim to set up complete papal absolutism. Unlike the Irish-domi- nated clergy in America, the Catholic clergy of Fra nce and of Germany and other European countries have never ful ly identified the pope himself with the seat of power in Rome.

In modern times, the European Catholic clergy veere d increas- ingly to the idea that it was advisable to encourag e Christian toler- ance and friendly relations with all religious sect s, even with those who belonged to no Church.

It would aim to set up an \"Evangelical\" Papac y which, freed of political ambitions, would act as a center of Ev angelical unity for all Churches of Christendom. This would indeed be t rue Catholic reform—a second Reformation, the setting up of Evan gelical Catholicism. It would mean the purging of medieval accretions of doctrine and liturgy and. of course, the complete b anishment again of the Jesuits from the Church and the world, as wa s accomplished by Pope Clement XIV in 1773. All such aims and plans for a liberal, Evangelical reform, how- ever, fell within the explicit condemnations of rel igious tolerance and the liberal, democratic idea by Jesuit-controll ed popes during the past 150 years. The late General of the Jesuits , Wernz, in his treatise on Canon Law, 1 says: \"As concerns the relations of the Catholic Church w ith other re- ligious associations, there is no doubt that all re ligious associations of unbelievers and all the Christian sects are rega rded by the Catho- lic Church as entirely illegitimate and devoid of a ll right of existence. These organizations are formally rebels against the Church. As a consequence, he is in grave error who believes that the different re- ligious sects, such as, for example, the Anglicans, the Lutherans, the Orthodox Catholics, constitute legitimate parts of a universal Church of Christ, and that they are in some way collateral branches of the Catholic Church, or sister Churches.\" Against this hope for true Catholic, reform that wo uld have brought about a tolerant, Evangelical Catholic Chri stian Church, the Jesuits swept the field for an absolutely total itarian set-up in Catholicism to go hand-in-hand with the Nazi-Fascis t regime in the secular order. On their side they had Hitler himsel f who, as far as condemnation of religious tolerance is concerned, h as always shown himself to be a better Catholic than the ordi nary European priest and many bishops. In Mein Kampf he upholds a nd approves of the dogmatic intolerance of the Vatican party in the Catholic Church; like the Jesuits he regards religious toler ance as an effective instrument for the establishment and support of the liberal aims 1 Cf. his Jus Decretalium.

The late Jesuit Cardinal Billot expresses true Jesuit contempt for this yielding of the secul ar clergy to liber- alizing tendencies, and also advocates the severity that should be meted out to them, when he speaks of \"the poor little parish priests who fill the greate r part of our religious magazines and periodicals with their speeches, seek ing thereby to create a new apologetic to take the place of the miracles which the 20th cen- tury no longer understands.

Pope Pius X I gave the Jesuit slogan Christus Rex 1 —\"Christ the King\"—to Catholic Action as the battle-cry for its crusade for Cathol ic Reconstruction of the social order. The same cry, Viva Christo Rey , was used by Franco's Fascists in their war against the legitima te Republican government of Spain. It was the war cry of the fana tic Mexican Indians who were spurred on by the Jesuits to commi t acts of sabotage against the Republican government of Mexic o. It was also the cry of the Spanish Rebel officers who, wit h the help of their Moorish troops, tortured, violated and slaugh tered nearly 15,000 men, women and children at Badajos.

In its issue of May 20, 1936, the Paris new spaper Le Temps called attention to the close relationship between the Rexist Party and Hitler's National Socialism, and shortly before the Belgian elections in May, 1936, Degrelle went to Germany to \"study\" Nazi propaganda methods.

In imita tion of Goeb- bels, he curried favor with the workers by appearin g to side with strikers.

The fraternizing of the secular clergy wit h the laity in these political parties furthered the spirit of tol erance as opposed to the traditional intolerance of Catholic dogma. On the other hand, it must also be remembered that in Ger- many the two Catholic political parties, the Center Party and the Bavarian Popular Party, because of their close reli gious connections with the Catholic Church, had met with strong oppos ition from the Protestant part of the population. As a consequ ence, the con- tinued existence of these parties threatened to com promise the aim of Catholic Action, which was to use Germany as the instrument to effect its counter-Reformation designs. It was t hus necessary for the new Catholic policy to camouflage itself as a n ational move- ment, and make itself appear as the only party repr esenting the nation as a whole. It can thus be seen why the abolition of the pre-Hi tler Catholic political parties in Germany had the approval of th e movement for Catholic Reconstruction. Here is what Gonzague de Reynold has to say on the point: 4 \"The Center Party, which Hitler fought with all his might, was forced to commit suicide. But it was a party which had already shown signs of deterioration, which had made many mistake s and upon which the young people were turning their backs . . . The news that soon they could take part in real Catholic Action, without an y addition of party politics, aroused great enthusiasm.\" For the very same reason the Rexist Party in Belgiu m, direct off- spring of Catholic Action, likewise declared: \"All Catholic parties are the result of a fixed his torical situation, and have advantages and disadvantages for the Churc h. \"When these historical situations cease to exist, Catholic part ies lose their reason for existence. This applies equally to the Catholic party in Belgium. Up till now differing opinions could be had as to thei r usefulness and their right to existence. Today, however, they are anarch ronisms, as were the Center Party in Germany and the Popular Party in It aly. \"The Catholic Party did not understand the new 'his toric mission'; 4 Cf.

Because of these deficiencies it had to d isappear like all other parties. The Rexist Party will now take up th e defense of Catholic and ecclesiasiteal interests. It does not only inte nd to defend the Church, but also to take the whole religious question out o f politics. It will effect this by means of the Constitutional guarantee of th e rights of the Catholic Church and by drawing up a concordat to re gulate the relations between the State and the Church.\" 5 Thus, according to this new Catholic policy, there is to be no apparent separation between Catholic Action and the Nazi-Fascist thrust for the establishment of its \"new order\" in Europe. To the Rexist Party was assigned the task of regulating th e relations between the Catholic Church and the Fascist State i n Belgium by means of a concordat, as was done in Germany throug h Von Papen and the present Pope Pius XII, then papal nuncio to Germany.. This \"new historic mission\" of the Church of Rome, initiated by the Lateran Pact and Concordat of 1929 between the Vatican and Fascist Italy, calls for collaboration with the Naz i-Fascist dictators, unhampered by any questioning or interference from the people or the lower clergy.

And t he real motivating force behind it all has been the thrust of the Jesuit counter-Reformation, ante-dating all the dictators, which aimed to crush out of existence the hated liberal princip les of the Protes- tant democracies. It has indeed been an ungodly com bination that worked together to accomplish this objective: Catho lic Reconstruc- tion movement of Pius XI; Italian Fascism; Hitler's National Socialism; French anti-Semitic Leagues; La Roque an d the Cagoul- ards; Belgian Rexism; the Hungarian racist movement of Father Bangha; white Russian association; Croatian associa tions—whose hand appeared in the assassination of King Alexande r of Serbia and French Foreign Minister Barthou; Slovene separa tists led by 5 Cf.

HIS TWELVE YEARS IN GERMANY Monsignor Pacelli's life has been divided between h is native Italy and Germany where he spent twelve crucial yea rs. Nuncio in Munich in 1917, he has dealt with the Kaiser and with the Republic, with revolutionary committees and Nazi co nspirators. He was a friend of Friedrich Ebert, first president of the German Republic, and an intimate of Germany's monumental H indenburg under whose presidency he concluded a concordat wit h Prussia. He witnessed Hitler's tempestuous beginnings in Mun ich and the machinations of his agents in Berlin. Viscount d'Abernon, Britain's first ambassador to the Weimar Republic, in his Memoirs calls Pacelli \"the best informed man in the Reich.\" His mission in Munich in 1917 was not the starting point of his German career. Even before the first world war, Mon signor Pacelli had been Papal State Secretary Gasparri's most trus ted expert on German affairs. It was no mere chance that in the v ery first months of the war he was stationed in Switzerland where he started with great devotion, tact and zeal, a truly Christian an d humanitarian movement—the exchange of prisoners of \"war.

All his life Eugenio Pacelli has taken an active pa rt in one of the most secret and complex intrigues of our time: the patient struggle of the papacy to regain and extend its tem poral power. In this struggle, for the last seventy years, whene ver a major issue of international politics was at stake, the Vatican has hitched its star to the Germanic juggernaut. HIS TIE-UP WITH FASCISM The Lateran Treaty in 1929 between the Vatican and Mussolini restored the sovereignty of the pope and allied the Vatican to the Italian Fascist Government. It also brought about a world-wide coordination of authoritarian powers of the corpora tive and na- tionalistic type, and the eventual entrance of Ital y into the camp of Nazi Germany. Thus in 1940, after the fall of Fr ance and the proclamation of Marshal Petain's Fascist French Sta te, it looked as if in the present World War Vatican policy had g ained substan- tial progress where it had failed in the previous o ne. At the end of this war, when delegates of all count ries will gather in an international peace conference, the po pe, for the first time in more than a hundred years, will again be re presented as a ruling monarch—provided that his miniature State is still intact. He expects to exercise considerable authority, alth ough as a tem- poral ruler his influence will be less than that of Pope Pius VII at the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Today, as Chief of State of Vati- can City he possesses only a formal, juridical stat us. But he will have real power because of his self-assumed status as \"Chief of Christendom,\" a notion cleverly introduced, for mor e than ten years, into public international discussions and, a fter centuries of obliteration, re-admitted even in non-Catholic coun tries.

It has been revived for politi- cal reasons, and unless de- nounced, will prove a dan- gerous challenge to free- dom and progress. For just as the equality of individu- als, the equality of nations is a fundamental principle of democracy. To recognize one Chief of State as senior and per- manent hierarchical chief of all other States would be to set up an authoritari- an world monarchy, even though the term 'mon- archy' may not be used. Caesar Augustus in ancient Rome refused the unpopu- lar title of king and pre- ferred to be called \"Imperator,\" a dignity which th e Roman Re- public used to bestow temporarily upon a Supreme Co mmander appointed in a national emergency. Hitler played th e same trick in Germany. It would have been easy for him to have ha d himself crowned Emperor. Instead, he found it more expedien t to leave the Constitution of the Weimar Republic legally in force and to assume the less conspicuous name of Fuehrer or Lead er—the \"Mein Fuehrer\" standing for the old-fashioned \"Your Majesty\" or \"Sire.\" Protestant nations, it is to be hoped, will not acc ept this new international slogan of a \"Chief of Christendom\" wh ich the Holy EUGENIO PACELLI — H OW POPE PIUS XII \". . . has always been known for his strong German leanings,\" says his official Catholic biographer, Kees van Hoek."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"68 B EHIND THE D ICTATORS See is trying to smuggle into general acceptance.

Recent statements by Mr. Elmer Davis as well as Vat ican diplo- matic activity seem to indicate that the Axis Power s are seeking the mediation of the Holy See. If the Government of the Protestant Kaiser tried to enlist the support of the Vatican, there is no reason why Hitler's predominantly Catholic Greater Germany should refrain from appealing to the pope, now that even t he most fanati- cal Nazis can no longer hope to conclude the war by a crushing Axis victory. The last time the pope's collaboratio n in post-war arrangements was made impossible by Article 15 of t he Secret Treaty of London between Italy and the Allies.

MATTHIAS ERZBERGER The story of Germany's collaboration with the Vatic an in the last war has been told, as so often before, by a de vout Roman Catholic who had himself been on the inside of the intrigue and who, vain by nature and bitter from disappointment, spoke out when he felt that he had been abandoned by his form er associates. Our witness is none other than Matthias Erzberger, leading mem- ber of the Catholic Center Party, militant German i mperialist in 1914, Germany's foreign propaganda chief until 1917 when he promoted the Reichstag's famous peace resolution, I mperial Under-Secretary of State, leader of the German armi stice delega- tion, Minister of Finance and one of the Fathers of the Weimar Republic. He was assassinated in 1921 by young Germ an nation- alists, a few months after the publication of his o utspoken book, My Experiences in the World War. 1 SECRET VATICAN TREATY WITH GERMANY One of Erzberger's chief objectives was to secure d iplomatic immunity and extra-territorial rights for the Holy See. As early as October, 1914, a few weeks after his appointment as chief of foreign propaganda, he suggested the establishment of a small neutral Papal State in that part of Rome which lies on the left bank of the Tiber, with a corridor to the sea and a port. His negoti- ations finally led to a draft treaty \"regarding the recognition of the temporal power of the Pope.\" This treaty, he says, had the approval of \"competent personalities of the German Foreign O ffice.\" The first version was submitted by Erzberger and his fr iends in Vatican 1 Erlebnisse im Weltkrieg, von Reichsfinanzminister A.

It is not astonishing that the liberal Government o f Italy should have resented this planned infringement of their co untry's sover- eignty by Germany and the Vatican. Nor was this all . Germany has never given without receiving. Only indirectly does Herr Erzberger inform his readers of the assistance which Germany had received and was to receive from the Holy See. INTERNATIONAL CATHOLIC COMMITTEE After Italy entered the war on the side of the Alli es, Erzberger, as the Kaiser's chief of propaganda, organized in c ollaboration with an emissary of the Papal Secretary of State, a n International Catholic Committee in which each country was repres ented by five or seven delegates. Its object was to urge upon all belligerents that the territorial independence and the political free dom of the Holy See should be guaranteed in the future peace. This International Catholic Committee and several of its sub-committee s met repeat- edly in Switzerland and Holland. Its chief purpose was to explain the German viewpoint to the world. Erzberger tells us that the high official of the Roman Curia with whom he negot iated in Switzerland was in charge of the exchange of prison ers of war. He was Monsignor Eugenio Pacelli, the present Pope Piu s XII. PAPAL PEACE OFFENSIVE Negotiations between Erzberger and Pacelli continue d through- out 1916. In June of that year Erzberger was \"asked by the German"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"72 B EHIND THE D ICTATORS Secretary of State to inform the Vatican that the G erman Govern- ment was willing to accept the good services of the Pope in the matter of peace and would appreciate them.\" He at o nce consulted with his \"friend, the representative of the Papal S ecretary of State in Switzerland\" [Pacelli], who believed that the ti me had come for \"winning the peace.\" But after the Vatican peac e move had produced its first results, it was checked by a par allel intervention of the German Foreign Office through Spain. The res ults which Berlin wished to obtain in 1916 were only of a dipl omatic and psychological nature. Germany was in fact merely tr ying to disin- tegrate the home front of the Allies and to obtain a clear picture of the political situation in the Allied camp. The Papal peace move thus suited the Kaiser's purpose. In 1917, after Eugenio Pacelli had been appointed n uncio in Munich, Wilhelm II became more outspoken in his dem ands. According to Pope Pius XII's official biography by Kees van Hoek (published in London in 1939 by Burns, Oates & Wash burn, Ltd., publishers to the Holy See), the Kaiser told Monsig nor Pacelli \"that the Pope should mobilize the Episcopate all o ver the world in a moral peace offensive and begin by using his spec ial influence on Catholic States by promoting [a separate] peace bet ween Italy and Austria.\" JESUIT PROPAGANDA AMONG PROTESTANTS Erzberger's propaganda mission ended shortly after Pacelli had taken up residence in Germany. With laudable frankn ess Erzberger tells us (page 7) that he had been assisted by \"a n umber of Jesuit priests who rendered us extremely valuable services in enlightening foreign countries.\" Nor were these propaganda activ ities limited to Catholic circles. It should be of interest to Pr otestants in America to discover that this prominent Roman Catholic poli tician, working hand in glove with the highest dignitaries of the p ope, also organ- ized what was known as \"Weekly Evangelical Letters. \" These letters were edited by Dr. Deissmann, Professor of Protestant theology at the University of Berlin and were addre ssed especially to American Protestants. \"Professor Deissmann,\" say s Erzberger, \"was very skillful in drawing up his mailing lists . . . We adapted the contents of these letters deliberately to Ameri can interests . . ."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"P RO -G ERMANISM OF P IUS XII 73 Professor Deissmann had reason to be satisfied with the response.

Erzberger's assassination in 1921 had been planned for some time. The young fanatics who killed him were only t he instruments of others who wished to eliminate this man who knew too much, who already had said too much and who had been too closely connected with events in which the promoters of the present World War saw Germany's humiliation. PACELLI'S POST-WAR ACTIVITIES Monsignor Pacelli's stay in Germany lasted in all m ore than twelve years. He was in Munich under the short-live d Bavarian Soviet Republic which he fought, and at the time of Hitler's first putsch in 1923. When France occupied the industrial Ruhr Valley because Germany refused to continue reparations pay ments, the Nunzio, though not accredited to Prussia, ostentati ously flew from the Bavarian capital to Duesseldorf in the Prussian Rhineland, and induced his friend Achille Ratti, then Pope Pius XI , to publish an open condemnation of the \"Ruhr adventure.\" In 1925 he obtained a concordat with Bavaria, a concordat with Prussia in 1929, after his appointment as nuncio in Berlin, and in 1933 th e famous con- cordat with the whole of Hitler's Germany. \"Cardinal Pacelli,\" wrote Kees van Hoek, his offici al Catholic biographer, in 1939, \"has always been known for his strong Ger- man leanings.\" Thus it is that Germans and Italians now have good reasons for looking forward hopefully to Pius XII's mediation o n their behalf. For his past history shows that, instead of condemn ing Hitler whom he knew well during the seven years of his sta y in Munich, he negotiated a concordat with the Nazis just as he tried to nego- tiate one with the Kaiser's Germany during the last war.

His brother, Francesco Pacelli, who drafted the Lateran Treaty with Fascism, had more t han a hundred secret conferences with Mussolini before the treaty was signed.

This is not the reaction of a d epraved spirit, nor of a body succumbing to a fatal disease. Theref ore I say that many of the plans for reconstruction are unnecessar ily radical and some of them even dangerous. Take for instance the suggestion contained in The P roblems of Lasting Peace by Herbert Hoover and H.

Besides it is useless, because borders with mixed p eoples are the rule and not the exception, as the heroic remedy se ems to imply. The best and most obvious thing to do is to abolish the borders altogether. For the reorganization of Europe a firm hand and co mmon sense are more essential than far-reaching schemes. Let us bear in mind that the peoples of Europe have borne the brun t of the attack aimed at the whole world. They stumbled and fell because the world failed to back them up. They have had the ir full share of turmoil and agony; what they need now is rest. T hey went through a nightmare of injustice and lawlessness; w hat they need now is justice and law. They fell victims to terror and extortion; provide them with adequate protection from both and the peace will last. At the present time more than a dozen European nati ons are anxiously waiting for liberation. As they differ, m ore or less, in their political organization and social structure, the builders of lasting peace will see, in each of them, a differen t facet of the problem.

It should not be a talkative super -parliament such as the League of Nations which talked its head off before acting, but a sober and rigid court for the arbitration of international quarrels—a watchdog of peace, barking at any aggres sive shadow and biting the enemy if need be.

I refer to the Vatican, headquarters of the Papacy. This disclosure may come as a shock, and no wonder. Ameri- cans are acquainted with only one face of the pope, his spiritual authority over an ancient and beautiful church. But we Europeans have become familiar, by history and experience, wi th another aspect of the pope, namely, as the chief of an inte rnational politi- cal organization admittedly anti-democratic and ant i-liberal. The traditional trend of the Vatican's policy was confi rmed anew by the 1943 New Year's message of Pope Pius XII. It co ntained not a single word of sympathy for the cause of the Unit ed Nations but, on the other hand, did not refrain from the us ual attack on socialism and communism. This occurred at a moment when our deadly struggle against the Axis needed the support of all men of good-will, without any political or religious di scrimination. Aimed at our ally, the Soviet Union, the attack of the pope was without doubt an unfriendly act to the cause of the United Nations."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"78 B EHIND THE D ICTATORS This unfriendly attitude was made still more clear and definite by the official announcement of the pope's \"strict neutrality\" in the war. Ostentatiously made on the occasion of a J apanese am- bassador's presentation to the Vatican in the Fall of 1942, it was intended obviously for the consumption of the Ameri can public, as an excuse for the Vatican's friendly relations w ith the Japanese government. Qui s'excuse, s'accuse. This ill-timed display of friendliness towards Japan amounted to another chal lenge to the United Nations. Contrasting the moral standard of t he Axis powers with the moral principles preached by the Ca tholic Church, we can say that the pope, in making his declaration of neutrality, was driven by his political zeal so far as to slap his own religious face. There have been many other occasions when the sympa thies of the Vatican with the Axis were plainly revealed. As for instance its attitude toward the war in Abyssinia and toward the Civil War in Spain. There was no neutrality of the pope in ei ther of them. On the contrary, he did his best to back up the agg ressors. He congratulated Mussolini and distributed sacred amul ets to the Italian troops going to Ethiopia. He sent Generalis simo Franco his blessing in the Spanish Civil War and presented his soldiers with victory medals. On October 13, 1935, the late Cardinal Hinsley, Cat holic archbishop of Westminister, the pope's chief agent in England, made a speech in defense of the friendly attitude a ssumed by the Vatican towards Fascism in its war against Abyssini a, and closed with the following words: \"While I do not in principle approve of Fascism, I do say that if Fas- cism goes under in Italy, then nothing can save the country from chaos.

According to this statement the Holy Father had inf ormed the bishop, \"that any and every connection or contact w ith Leftist currents is forbidden to Roman Catholics and must b e most strenu- ously fought by the church.\" These records taken at random from the rich choice of papal enunciations in recent years give ample evidence of the Vatican's sympathies with Nazism and Fascism in the critical period before the pact of Munich. We are therefore justified in t aking the pope's \"strict neutrality\" in the second World War not too seriously. It is nothing but a strategic smoke-screen intended to cover his rela- tionship with our foes, which he did not even bothe r to conceal until the entrance of the United States into the wa r. It seems natural now to raise the question how far back that relationship can be traced. In other words, what part has politi cal papacy played in the European tragedy these last twenty ye ars? VATICAN ALIGNMENT WITH FASCISM A SUPERFICIAL VIEW of Nazism and Fascism shows, asi de from their coincidence, so many features in common, that it is difficult to believe the resemblance to be merely a ccidental. The closer you examine the two movements, the more they are likely to appear as children of the same spirit. Let us tr y to get closer to that spirit by analyzing its development. Both movements started not as revolutionary eruptio ns from below, but as counter-revolutions, aiming explicitl y to be the salva- tion of state, society and religion from the danger of the liberal wave which flooded the European continent in the ye ars after the first World War. In accordance with this program th e two oppos- ing camps were clearly outlined: on one side the al lied conserva- tives and reactionaries, and on the other side libe rals and socialists.

The anti-democratic character of both Fascism and N azism re- veals further that their sources could not have bee n of low origin.

Under these circumstances it would have been imposs ible for obscure nobodies, as were Hitler and Mussolini at t hat time, to mobilize the masses for a bloody crusade against th e masses of the people and their liberal governments unless they we re backed by some political force of extraordinary qualities—a f orce reaching up to the summits of society as well as down to its depths, one ex- ercising a strong influence in the international ar ena and keeping itself cleverly out of sight. There is but one forc e qualified in this extraordinary way, namely political Papacy, centere d in the Vatican. After this excursion of general character, let us n ow go back to our evidence. The various facts previously menti oned are sig- nificant indeed, but they do not constitute suffici ent evidence of the collaboration of the Vatican with the Axis. The y confirm only what every student of history knows, that the Papac y is and always has been anti-democratic and anti-liberal. But by t hemselves they do not prove that the Vatican had a part in the wor ld-wide con- spiracy, launched by Nazism and Fascism, against de mocracy and liberty. A past master of political intrigues, such as the Vatican is, makes documentary evidence hard to find. We can onl y hope to catch an occasional glimpse through the cracks in i ts political walls. Bishops in politics, as in chess, move obliq uely. One insight was furnished by The Catholic Internati onal, a new periodical, recently published in New York. It iden tified itself as \"a magazine of Christian decency for the Christian home and edited under clerical direction.\" This magazine contained the following amazing comment on the fall of France: \"The earthly disaster has been a heavenly blessing. The days of Socialism and Freemasonry are gone forever in France . . . Isn't it all glori ous?\" And, turning to Italy, it continued: \"And in Italy too . . .

They not only offered an offi cial avowal of intolerance and hatred of public education, but als o expressed exultation at the New Order established by Fascism both in Italy and France. They also proved that the interests of the Vatican were on the side of the dictators all during these last twenty years. Was this community of interests a simple coincidenc e or was it founded on a premeditated coalition? The answer to this question must necessarily be hidden in the roots of World Wa r II. In order to lay them bare, the principal events of these las t twenty-five years must be reviewed in the light of the role that the Vatican has played behind the European stage. We must begin wit h the Rus- sian Revolution of 1917-18, because it was in relat ion to this revo- lution that the contemporary counter-revolution sta rted and devel- oped. While the first World War is likely to go dow n in history as a mere nuisance, it will rank high in the histor y of mankind for having fathered the Russian Revolution, a social up heaval of greater importance and greater consequence than eve n the French Revolution of 1789. The young plant of Russian Liberty was raised under the most unfavorable conditions, but received so loving a ca re as to enable the youngster, only twenty-five years later, to joi n the United Nations in their fight against slavery and to do a highly efficient and successful job. It is no exaggeration to say th at the Soviet Union, born out of the first World War, became the life-saver of liberty in World War II. I like to believe that humanity has a bodyguard ana logous to the emergency squadron of cells in our body, which comes to its rescue in case of injury or fever. I like to believ e that the birth of the Russian Republic in 1917 was due to providentia l planning to have a bodyguard for liberty at hand in 1941. This romantic belief is strongly supported by the unusual circumstances which paved the way for the birth of the Soviet Union. For it w as the German High Command in the first World War who in 1917 dis patched Lenin and his aides from their exile in Switzerland to the Russian border, in a sealed railway car, in order to start the revolution that brought about the collapse of Imperial Russia from within.

As long as the peace lasted it c ould get no- where. But in the first World War Russian soldiers set the spark to the fuse when, after three years of terrible los ses and hardships, they were driven by whips against the German lines without food and ammunition. It is possible that the revolution might have started without Lenin and his friends, but it certa inly would have succumbed before long without their intellectual le adership. After having overthrown the Czar and established a govern- ment of their own, the Russian people turned to the much harder task of rebuilding their utterly exhausted country. There is no one who does not admit that the Russian Revolution was morally justified, and entitled according to in ternational prin- ciples to be considered a purely internal affair of Russia alone, without any interference from without. But in this case of a people fighting against its unjust oppressors, the conserv ative chancel- leries of Europe thought fit to intervene—as they h ad done in the French Revolution in 1792. Although fighting among themselves, it took them no time to agree upon this decision. B loody foes of yesterday made common cause to crush the young Sovi et Union. These 'White Guardsmen' invaded Russia from the Nor th and the South simultaneously, ravaging the country and committing atrocities against the population. But this time, w ith liberty at stake, the Russian soldiers fought like heroes and succeeded after one year of fierce fighting in beating back the inv aders and driving them out of the country. Then again the Russian peo ple dropped their arms and took up sickle and hammer to continu e their work of reconstruction.

The balance of political power started shifting from th e Right to the Left. Far from opposing this trend, the parties of the Right were only too glad to take a leave of absence from the p ublic stage. Although responsible for the outbreak of the war th ey did not like the idea of signing the peace. They knew it wa s a suicidal job and preferred to have it done by men of the Left. F urthermore, the post-war economic reconstruction was a hard task, b oth difficult and ungrateful. These requirements did not suit the reactionaries. They, in general, like to take a rich country and r un it down; then they let others have their turn. According to this policy the reactionaries modestly stood back and allowed the socialists to come to the front. Th is was their formula for the establishment of so-called National Government, that would embrace men both of Left and Right for c ooperation in the reconstruction. As a rule the chiefs of state w ere taken from the Left. As a matter of fact, at that time, the whole continent of Europe looked like a progressive and peaceful socie ty of nations. But the political modesty and self-denial of the re actionaries were nothing but a clever maneuver. By withdrawing from the scene, they were at the same time preparing for future att ack. Having men of their own party in the government, they had only to watch for their opportunity to come after their passive r esistance had worn down the wave of liberalism. They were not a bit afraid of the socialists, thoug h these had succeeded in rallying under their banner the bulk o f the workers in the big cities and industrial centers. While the socialists and liberals held the majority in the urban places, the decisive factor for a majority in parliament were the rural distric ts, and here the liberals were impotent against the influence of the traditional political bosses, the pope and his reactionary part ies. As the great- est private landowner throughout Catholic Europe, t he pope exerts by this very fact, since time immemorial, an econom ic and political control over the rural population, in whose minds t he tradition of the feudal system is still stronger than the writte n law.

The peasants were warned to ward o ff socialism, as the foe of God and religion which leads inevitab ly to eternal damnation. No ordinary political party could afford to maintai n the vast organization necessary for such a political grip. O nly the pope had it in his church all ready and organized throughout the different countries, down to the smallest hamlet, like a well -organized and disciplined army—every priest a soldier trained in blind obedience to the bishops, the officers of the pope. It is by these means that the workers and peasants are kept in opposite political camps: by the coordination of ec onomic and religious pressure. This papal policy has been supported by the reactio naries of Europe, ever since the French Revolution, with last ing success. It was the government of the young Soviet Union which opposed that policy for the first time in European history. Although it de- creed freedom of worship throughout the Union, at t he same time it forbade the clergy to misuse religion for politi cs or to interfere with public education, their activities to be limit ed strictly to their spiritual services in the church. It made religion a private affair. This measure was a necessary provision for the ment al armament of the youth of the young republic. A system of public education had to be provided whe reby the youth would be raised to general appreciation and p reservation of liberty, free from reactionary influence. The leade rs of the Soviet Union realized that liberty is uncertain and very l ikely to get lost unless youth is provided with such a mental armor t hrough public school education. The reactionaries were pierced to the quick by that decree of the Russian government. It meant that one hundred a nd sixty million people were on the way to real liberty, of body and mind.

The whole of Europe was to be mobilized for a crusade to that end. The firs t thing to do was to discontinue their political vacationing and to get the power at home well in hand again. In the meantime Europe had to be safe- guarded against mental contamination, and to this e nd Russia was to be placed under permanent international quaranti ne. The shadow of World War II began to emerge. In accordance with these decisions the reactionarie s started a campaign of defamation throughout the world against the Soviet Union and its government unique in its extension an d ferocity. There is no crime or blasphemy of which the men in the Kremlin were not guilty. They murdered millions of Russians and forced the people into \"godless\" communism. It is not nece ssary for me to go deeper into the subject of this defamatory ca mpaign. AH of us have witnessed it and many of us have fallen und er its spell. It took a second World War to lift the ban after twent y years. The reactionary parties were now again very busy wi th their domestic politics. Their stratagem of temporary abs tention from active politics had worked according to plan. The a ftermath of the first World War had made life for the great mass of the people extremely difficult. Shortage of food and inflation weighed heavily on their shoulders because the enormous cost of the war had not been equally distributed. Landlords and industriali sts had managed in time to rid themselves of their war loans, payin g off their mort- gages or enlarging their factories and equipment fo r a trifle, while workers and employees fought a hopeless battle agai nst the onrush- ing tide of inflation. The economic coat of the Eur opean nations was buttoned awry and needed, according to the famo us formula of Prince Bismarck, to be opened up and buttoned an ew. The socialists in the governments were not blind to the danger. They saw the necessity for strong measures, but all thei r attempts to do something about it were now frustrated by the other parties of the Coalition. Instead of cooperating with the liberals for the benefit of the nation, these parties, Nationalists and Cler icals, now saw their opportunity at hand to stab the liberals in t he back and they did not hesitate to do so regardless of public inte rests.

Originally an obscure journalist in the socia list camp, he changed his coat in time, and so quit the socialist party and devoted his ability to tireless braying for the ben efit of radical Nationalism. Then came his sudden rise, like that o f a rocket, to the chiefdom of a party. Nobody knew who it was tha t set him off, but it was undoubtedly a force of high standin g. It was gener- ally known that his personal means did not allow hi m the pur- chase of more than half a dozen black shirts for hi mself and much less for the equipment and pay of his followers. Th e general guess at that time pointed to a rich industrialist as his sponsor. But then came the famous March on Rome which destroyed this conjecture. The boss was evidently to be looked for higher up. The Italian people are fond of theatrical performan ces, but the March on Rome was a poor one and they did not like it. Mussolini did not march at all. He came by train. Nobody was deceived. Those guns were hired and paid for in cash. The gar rison of Rome could have annihilated this mummery in a short whil e. But, instead of having the Blackshirts thrown out of his capital , the king sat down with Mussolini to a friendly discussion of his kingdom's affairs and without further ado surrendered the man agement and the future of his kingdom to the upstart, reserving for himself only the title of king. Mussolini became Dictator of Ita ly over night; no fairy tale could do it easier. But who was the m agician ?

For Musso lini it was the time for the payment of the royalties agreed up on with his author. Besides receiving from Mussolini 750 millio n lire in cash and one billion lire in Fascist government stock, t he Vatican got a tiny but substantial sovereignty, carved out from Italy's heart, a Treaty and a Concordat, making Catholicism the sole Church of the kingdom and giving the clergy full control o ver the people's education. The union between the Vatican and Fascis m was publicly sealed. The Vatican could now, after many years, enjoy again the attributes and privileges of diplomatic s overeignty, which are of inestimable value in the game of inter national politics —though meaningless to religion and even incompatib le with it. That remarkable pact of 1929 did not only reveal to the public the real boss of Fascism; it made it clear that pol itical papacy was once more on the rampage.

It is sig- nificant that ten years of ruthless pursuit of his bloody strategy had not brought victory to the Nazi party by the wa y of elections. I believe we have to give the German people credit for this proof of their will to resist evil, against heavy odds. T he fact is that in 1932 the Nazi tide obviously began to turn.

The Third Republic was doomed because it represente d not a united French nation, but a thousand streamlets of political, social, and religious discriminations, and these streamlets had long before eroded the roots of the Republic and the foundation s of the national structure. In this condition France could not withstand the shock of German aggression. Now we face the tas k of ex- plaining the source of those disruptive streamlets. The French Revolution in 1789 left France without t he indis- pensable armament for the defense of her newly-won liberty and democracy. Such an armor can be given a nation only by means of an efficient public educational system. But this wa s never accom- plished, and this failure explains why France never succeeded in becoming a united nation in both her political and social life. There were two Houses of Legislature and in both of them the clerical parties, directed by the Vatican, held a d ecisive position between Left and Right, turning the political balan ce, at their will, on any important issue. These parties of the Vatican, looking serenely on the conflict between Left and Right, fa nned the flames and widened the gap between the two political camps in order to increase the national political turmoil. One of the questions most important to them was the matter of public schools. Supported by the parties of the Rig ht, they saw to it that the public schools were poorly equipped, an d that the pay- ment of the teachers did not rise above the minimum . But, at the same time, the Vatican kept on entertaining and enl arging a vast system of private schools affiliated with the conve nts and other religious bodies. These private schools of the chur ch were better equipped than the national public schools, and, in general, more exclusive socially because of their higher cost of tuition.

To these psychological inducements were added the s olemn admonition from the pulpits not to send Christian c hildren to public schools \"where atheist teachers are employed .\" The spirit transmitted to the children in the clerical schools was naturally not in harmony with the Republic's motto: \"Liberty, Equality and Fraternity.\" The political harvest of the church by this private educational system becomes clear, if you bear in mind that the graduates of those clerical private schools were destined to bec ome the back- bone of the country's administration. With a diplom a from one of the clerical schools they were sure to be given preference; and this system, from generation to generation, had suc ceeded in cov- ering the whole field of administration by a networ k of reactionary administrative officials, to whom the directives, f rom the nearest bishopric, meant much more than the principles of t he Republic. Add to this the wide-spread influence of the girls and future wives and mothers coming out of convent schools and you will understand how it came about that the more influent ial part of the French nation was systematically imbued with a spir it indifferent, more often hostile, to the principles of the Republ ic. In this way the Vatican held a tight grip on the ad ministration and spirit of France, and will continue to do so, a s long as the education of French youth is not made the exclusive privilege of the State. This is the main reason why the national unity of the French nation cannot be achieved. This is the reaso n why the French Republic has never been a republic of the pe ople. It has been said that France was ruled by some two hundred aristocratic and rich families, but behind these fa milies has always stood the powerful organization of the Vatican, dir ecting them according to its political strategy. Those ruling f amilies of France were only too willing to be guided in that way beca use they knew they had a common cause and that their rule over Fr ance could not be challenged effectively by the people as long as they followed the guidance of the Vatican.

Every new century brought about new bloody installments of that lasti ng spiritual feud, at the bottom of which lies the indomitable s pirit of the Czechs for independence and liberty, a claim no pop e liked to hear, much less to grant. Therefore we see down through t he centuries the bloody trail of papacy sweep the Czech country over and over again. Every century brought a new installment of t he pope's anger and the twentieth century was no exception. I ts contribution was by no means the least one. Let us hope it will be the last. After the first World War the government of the pro mising young democracy realized the danger threatening it from the Vatican and it tried to evade it. But the effort wa s not sufficiently bold and courageous. A sort of compromise was made with the Vatican, in order to attain a modus vivendi. That w as the mistake. The Czech leaders should have known that a modus vi vendi with the Vatican meant death. Well-instructed in Europe' s history, they should have remembered the old French proverb: Qui mange du pape, en meurt—that is, literally, \"He who eats from the pope dies.\" And so it happened in 1938, when Hitler's campaign against Czechoslovakia approached its climax, that the Czec h people were stabbed in the back by the declaration of an indepe ndent state of Slovakia, in which the Slovak people themselves had no part what- soever.

They even managed to approach and attract the peasantry in the provinces. Supported by liberal intellectual s and scientists they began to found public libraries in many small communities, thereby stimulating the appetite for reading and le arning, a feast hitherto unknown to the country folk. This development of a peaceful progress came to an abrupt end in February 1934, when the two other parties of the 'National Government,' the Christian Socialists (the pope's p arty) and the German Nationals, together started their bloody cou p d'etat which buried the Republic. This attack was carefully prep ared for some years previous by the Chancellor Msgr. Ignaz Seipel , a Roman Catholic priest. He broke up the National Governmen t and by combining the Christian Socialist party with the Ge rman Nationals against the socialists, started Austria on its way to civil war. The German Nationals had traditionally been foes of the Catho- lic church. They hated Christianity in general and the Roman church in particular. For more than 50 years the sl ogan of their stormy, but not numerous party had been: 'Los Von R om,' which means: 'Away from the Roman Church.' Nevertheless, Msgr. Seipel constantly rejected the repeated proposition s of the socialists for a lasting understanding as the base for a solid government, the only security for a peaceful future. Seipel accepte d the Ger- man Nationals as his allies in 1930 and the interna l strife was on. When Msgr. Seipel died, he was succeeded by a man h e himself had picked out—Engelbert Dollfuss, trained and educ ated by the Jesuits. It was Doilfuss who in May, 1932, suppress ed the Repub- lican constitution and established an authoritarian government. In parliament he mustered a majority of one, but did n ot hesitate to abolish it altogether when it got deadlocked, which was naturally bound to happen. Relying on the armed organizations of the Ger- man Nationals he allowed and even encouraged them t o deliber- ately attack workers and their organizations. The s ignal for the massacre was given on February 12, 1934. The worker s tried to resist, but had to give up when the national army b ombarded their homes.

It did not take the new government long to show its true c olors. From the first moment of victory, dissension split the t wo government parties and public administration began to show sig ns of deteriora- tion. Corruption and nepotism spread so rapidly tha t before long they became the only keys to all higher posts in pu blic service. At the same time heedless squandering of public funds developed for the benefit of party leaders on one side and of monasteries and abbeys on the other. Working hours were lengthened and wages lowered. The indebtedness of the State and of munic ipalities went soaring despite constantly heavier taxation. In sho rt, this adminis- tration did so well, that it succeeded in less than two years in fos- tering and concentrating on itself the hatred of th e population. I remember the exclamation of a hotel-keeper in Carin thia province in the summer of 1936: 'Anything would be better th an this clerical pest!' Not everybody was as outspoken as that, but the sentiment was a fairly general one. Under such circumstances it seemed only natural that Nazi propaganda began to make rapid he adway in Austria. Then came the assassination of Dollfuss. Schuschnig g, another of Msgr. Seipel's Jesuit-trained pupils, took his p lace. From the very beginning he was at the mercy of the German Na tionals in the government. Boasting openly of their relations with Berlin, they kept extorting more and more concessions from him for the Nazi party in Austria. In his desperate situation S chuschnigg turned to Mussolini for help. Mussolini had repeate dly declared he would fight for the independence of Austria, bec ause he hated to see German soldiers on the Brenner. But this tim e it was another story. Mussolini disclosed to Schuschnigg in July 1 937 that Italy was by now disinterested in Austria's independence. And so the tragic end came. On March 13, 1938, Hitler, at the head of a strong force, made his cautious entry into Austria and Vienna. Heavy b ombers roared day and night over the city. The frightened people dared not even leave their homes.

SPAIN THE CADAVER OF AUSTRIA was the indispensable bridge for the military coalition between Nazism and Fascism. But this broth- erhood in arms materialized for the first time on t he battlefields of Spain, when the rebellion of Franco against the leg al government of Spain started in 1936. This was the first joint open move by the reactionary coalition against democracy and liberty . It was the first practical test of the coalition and offered t o German and Italian bombardiers the opportunity for practicing on livin g \"Red\" tar- gets. Both tests had satisfactory results. German a nd Italian bom- bers did a truly devastating job for Franco, while the big democra- cies continued, like a well conducted orchestra, to play appease- ment and non-intervention tunes, not heeding the fa ct that the war in Spain was in reality a war against themselves. The role played by the Vatican in the Spanish Civil War is generally known; and there is no need, therefore, t o explain it in detail here. It was really the Vatican's war. Aside from the desire to kill the young Spanish Republic, the Vatican had a real material grievance against its government. That democratic government had dared to abolish the tax ex- emption for the vast domains of the pope, and, as w e well know, the Papacy has always been most sensitive to the ma tter of money and revenues. The victorious Franco promptly restor ed that tax exemption, brought back the Jesuits, and the Cathol ic church again enjoys its full revenues from Spain, while th e Spanish people starve."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"A V ITAL C ONDITION F OR L ASTING P EACE 105 HITLER'S MISTAKE WITH THE SIGNING OF THE MUNICH PACT and the in- vasion of Czech territory in March, 1939, the stage for the killing of the Soviet Union was definitely set.

I ve nture to assert that the historic events and the undeniable facts p ointed out on our way furnish ample evidence of the Vatican's pol itical activity, and show, furthermore, to what disaster this activi ty has led. We have seen the Vatican, as an outspoken supporter of Fascism, fos- tering and spreading dissension among Nations, inst igating blood- shed and war, in short, violating by political acti vity the religious principles of the Catholic church itself. Now we ca n evaluate the real meaning of the friendly relations between the Vatican and Japan and of the pope's declaration of \"strict neut rality\" in World War II for human rights and liberty. Both moves wer e of a highly political nature and greatly injurious to the cause of the United Nations. They cast a shadow of distrust into the so uls of millions of simple minded people as to the righteousness of our cause. But since that attack came from a political quarter, we are entitled to strike back. It is even our duty to do so and expla in to those people that political opinion issued by the Vatican, or an y high Catholic prelate, cannot be expected to be necessarily in ac cordance with the religious spirit of the church and should, ther efore, not be accepted blindly but scrutinized and weighed carefu lly by reason and conscience.

No kind of post-war organization of Europe can secure a durable peace, as long as the incendiary p roduction of the Vatican has not been stopped. The problem is to cut the strings which are pulled by the Vatican for political purpo ses. To this end I recommend the following: 1) Absolute separation between State and Church; 2) Absolute separation between School and Church; 3) Every religions community must constitute an autono mous and independent corporation under the law; 4) Individual governments should take over, within the ir territory, all agricultural land, owned or controlled by the V atican, directly or through an ecclessiastical body, for the benefit of small peas- ants and landless farmers. 5) Democratization of the Catholic church by proportio nate repre- sentation of Cardinals from democratic countries, a nd by giving the Catholic people a voice in the election of bish ops and the management of church properties. These propositions are a vital condition for lastin g peace in Europe. They need no commentary. The need for each of them can be seen directly and interpreted by one or anot her of the his- toric events and facts revealed above.

As a reminder of this ice sent the following to the \"Times\" after its attack on \"Izvestia,\" Russian Government newspaper, on Feb. 5, 1944. because of its factual criticism of the pro-F ascist policy of the Vatican in our time: February 14, 1944 THE EDITOR, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES,\" Dear Sir: Your severe editorial of February 5, opposing Isves tia's criticism of the Vatican, entirely overlooked the known facts in the matter of the Vatican's consistent support of German milit arism for the past 100 years. Are you aware that your own New York Times once edi torially castigated the Vatican in much more scathing terms than Izvestia for the same reason, accurately prophesying that th e issue \"will be potent in molding the history of Europe for years t o come\"! This editorial in The New York Times called the Vatican' s support of German militarism \"the profound immorality of the t emporal policy of the Church of Rome.\" The editorial appeared in The New York Times of Feb ruary 8, 1887. and is as follows: \"All is grist that comes to the mills of Rome. The collision between the spirit of military absolutism and the spirit of Parliamentary liberty in Germany, a contest watched with the deep est interest all over the world, and whose issue will be potent in m olding the history of Europe for years to come, is viewed by the Pope merely as a wel- come opportunity to improve the condition of the Ro man Catholic Church in Germany. \"The party of the Centre in the Reichstag is the Ca tholic party. Dr. Windthorst, who has been its leader throughout the long struggle against the May laws, is its leader now. He led the successful opposi- tion to Bismarck's bill increasing the army and pro viding for its sup- port for a period of seven years, commonly called t he Septennate bill."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"108 B EHIND THE D ICTATORS When the Reichstag had rejected the bill and Bismar ck had dissolved that body and a new general election had been order ed, Baron Frank- enstein sent to Koine, through the Papal Nuncio at Munich, an inquiry as to the views and wishes of the Pope Concerning t he conduct of Catholics in the struggle. The Pope's reply is made in a letter written by Cardinal Jacobini: 'That the Septennate question embraces re- ligious and moral considerations which justify him in expressing the opinion that he may expect from the Centre party's conciliation to- wards the measure a beneficial effect in the final revision of the May laws.' The Pope desires, moreover, 'to meet the views of Em- peror William and Bismarck, and thereby induce the powerful German Empire to improve the position of the Papac y.' . . . \"One sentence of Dr. Windthorst's address reveals w ith pitiless and perhaps unintentional frankness the profound im morality of the temporal policy of the Church of Rome. \"The Pope's advocacy of the Septennate bill,\" said Dr. Windthorst, 'was indepen dent of the merits of the measure, and arose from reasons of expedienc y and from political considerations.' It would be difficult to frame a more accurate analysis of the Papal motives while at the same time indi- cating a more sweeping denunciation of the Papal po licy. Liberal principles, the right of popular government, the Ge rman constitution and its guarantee of Parliamentary institutions, sa ys the Pope, may go to the dogs if we can secure some further modifi cation of the laws which relate to the Church, and so improve the cond ition of the Papacy in Germany.\" The New York Times' dire prophecy came true, as the First and Second World Wars sadly testify. Pope Leo's Kill's command to the Catholic Center party in 1887 to aid militarism in Germany was a contributing factor to the First World War. Again in 1933, when the Vatican removed the Catholic Center party as th e only remain- ing obstacle to Hitler's rise to power, the Second World War began. How true it is that a strong militarist Germany is essential to the Vatican policy can be seen in the late Kaiser Wilhe lm's Memoirs, where be tells that on h is visit to Pope Leo X I I I , the latter insisted that \"Germany must become the sword of the Catholic Church.\"* (Signed) LEO H.
