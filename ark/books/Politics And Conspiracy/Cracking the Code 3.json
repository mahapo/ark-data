The Crown’s continuous control of, and monopoly over, the U.S. judicial system is confessed nowhere more eloquently than in the July – August 1976 edition of the Journal of t he Missouri Bar (p. 271), by Wade F. Baker, Executive Director of The Missouri Bar: “ It was almost eight hundred years ago, in 1178 A.D., during the reign of Henry II , that citizens of England, because of unscrupulous practices of untrained persons, pet itioned the king for establishment of a trained body of men and women, learned and skilled in the law, whose character would be attested by the crown. The legal profession was thus formalized and given a monopoly by the crown to practice law for the publi c good. “ When the United States Constitution was adopted , it granted to each citizen the trial of all crimes by jury, and Amendment VI to the constitution confirmed the right of assistance of counsel in such trials . Each state’s constitution has provide d that citizens have the right to appear and defend in person and by counsel in criminal prosecutions. “ Thus, for eight centuries, the legal profession has been formally recognized and granted a monopoly to serve the public....” “ Courts are in the main m anaged by lawyers who hold judicial positions ...” ( Underline and bold emphasis added)"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":" 2 51 Revise footnote 30 as follows : Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, Esq. is the most recent recipient of honorary knighthood (“...in recognition of ‘the benefit that the United Kingdom has received from the wisdom and skill’ of the Fed chief,” quoting Queen Elizabeth in “Greenspan is Given the Royal Treatment,” LA Times, 9/27/2002) but apparently the past many American presidents also have been honored with knighthood (“Si r”; title of nobility) bestowed by the Queen. 56 New footnote: Under “Fair Debt Collection Practices Act” (in middle of page), after first bulleted entry, “Contacts regarding unpaid tax” All contacts from IRS (phone, mail, email, in person) are “Contac ts regarding unpaid tax.” Therefore, this simple admission is proof that IRS is not part of government — because all IRS tax - collection activity is subject to FDCPA. 57 New footnote: Second paragraph, fourth line, after the phrase, “in the field” \"In the fi eld\" : \"The words 'in the field' imply military operations with a view to an enemy...and it has been said that in view of the technical and common acceptation of the term, the question of whether an armed force is 'in the field' is not to be determined by t he activity in which it may be engaged at any particular time....\" Uniform Code of Military Justice Act of 5 May 1950 .

Using bar - card - carrying urban guerrillas in three - piec e suits called “attorneys at law,” rather than M - 16 - toting mercenaries in government - issue camouflage, the Crown — and the banking interests behind it — has almost completely wrapped up its mission by successfully infiltrating and subjugating the government of nearly every country on Earth. No longer do people in America live their life “under God,” as originally intended at the inception of this country, but “ under rule of law ,” as quoted directly from the mission statement (military objective) of both bar as sociation and judicial system. Even the so - called, sham “separation of church and state” doctrine has been utterly debauched across the land, with officer - of - the - state esquires 2 dictating policy over tax - exempt, slave - of - state religious corporations. Hid den in plain sight on the pages of any major metropolitan newspaper in America on any given day is a status report on just how far down the primrose path we have been led by the “honorable” esquires that comprise approximately 58% the legislative, judicial , and executive branches of the U.S. government. Apparently, it is now common knowledge that “ black is really white ” and that “ up is really down ”: men and women have earthly existence and can effect physical changes on the world around them; corporations exist in name only and can neither think nor speak nor act in any way, but still are considered capable of it by the legislative branch (congress), accused of it by the executive branch (prosecutors) and tried for it by the judicial branch (judges) every d ay. From a front - page article in the June 16, 2002 edition of the LA Times entitled “Andersen Found Guilty of Obstruction”: “HOUSTON — A federal jury convicted accounting firm Arthur Andersen of obstruction of justice Saturday, sending the firm to the brink of extinction and giving the Justice Department a crucial win in its probe of Enron Corp.   2 “ It is generally accepted that an attorney is an officer of the Court and, as such, an officer and ar m of the state. ” 7 Corpus Juris Secundum 4, Virgin Islands Bar Association v. Dench , D.C. Virgin Islands, 124 F. Supp. 257."},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":" 4 “Jurors said the verdict arose not from Andersen’s shredding of Enron documents — the crux of the government’s case — but from the actions of an Andersen sta ff attorney who has not been charged and who invoked her right not to testify at the trial....” “Sentencing is set for Oct. 11, when the firm could face a $500,000 fine....” The jury determined that Nancy Temple, an Andersen attorney, had criminal inten t when she ordered the shredding of certain Enron documents. However, Temple has been officially forgotten and the criminal/financial (commercial) charge is being leveled against Andersen, an artificial person with no capability of physical action. Even though corporate Andersen can “act” only through its attorney, the idea - in - the - mind, ink - on - paper corporation has been convicted of criminal acts, and will soon be fined for crimes committed by the actual, flesh - and - blood perpetrator, who enjoys the benefi t of a title of nobility (immunity from prosecution). The legal system has officially equated men and women with a corporation via instigation of, and insistence upon, the TRADE NAME, and now selectively criminally/financially (commercially) charges eith er in accordance with its immediate needs. In the above example, as with countless others, the officer - of - the - state, British - title - of - nobility - holding criminal remains free to continue serving the Crown in its rape of America via the judicial system and b ar association without interference. 80 New footnote: Last paragraph, 10 th line, after the phrase, “retirement age” “White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer took a swing at the existing Social Security program.

Black’s 7 th . 146 Add the following definitions and “Note” under “ MONEY ” MONEY. A general, indefinite term fo r the measure and representative of value; currency; the circulating medium; cash. “ Money ” is a generic term, and embraces every description of coin or bank - notes recognized by common consent as a representative of value in effecting exchanges of property or payment of debts. Hopson v, Fountain, 5 Humph. (Tenn.) 140. Money is used in a specific and also in a general and more comprehensive sense. In its specific sense, it means what is coined or stamped by public authority, and has its determinate value fixed by governments. In its more comprehensive and general sense, it means wealth, — the representative of commodities of all kinds, of lands, and of everything that can be transferred in commerce. Paul v. Ball, 31 Tex. 10. In its strict technical sense, “ money ” means coined metal, usually gold or silver, upon which the government stamp has been impressed to indicate its value. In its more proper sense, “ money ” means any currency, tokens, bank - notes, or other circulating medium in general use as the repr esentative of value. Kennedy v. Briere, 45"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":" 5 Tex. 305.... Black’s 3 rd . \"Congress can exercise no power by virtue of any supposed inherent sovereignty in the General Government. Indeed, it may be doubted whether the power can be correctly said to apperta in to sovereignty in any proper sense as an attribute of an independent political community . The power to commit violence, perpetrate injustice, take private property by force without compensation to the owner, and compel the receipt of promises to pay in place of money , may be exercised, as it often has been, by irresponsible authority, but it cannot be considered as belonging to a government founded upon law. But be that as it may, there is no such thing as a power of inherent sovereignty in the Governm ent of the United States.\" Juilliard v. Greenman , (1884) 110 U.S. 421. See Note. Confer value . Note: Gold — which is actually “portable land” — is the money of sovereigns and consists of value . Before the 1933 declared bankruptcy of the US Government, mone y consisted of gold and silver specie, as well as its equivalent in certificate form, and was representative of value . Today’s so - called “ money ” (Federal Reserve Notes) is fiat money , i.e. “ money by decree,” “Monopoly ™ money ,” is not representative of val ue, but rather debt/liability , and is the money of artificial persons, called banks, governments, corporations, trusts, and “individuals” ( see individual ), etc. [Please also note the use of the word “public” in the expression public authority that appears in the sixth line of the first definition above. Although Big Brother very cleverly disguises the true meaning of this term contemporarily, this 1933 usage makes it very clear: “public” = government.] 157 Add the following definitions and “Note” unde r “ PUBLIC ” “... Money is used in a specific and also in a general and more comprehensive sense. In its specific sense, it means what is coined or stamped by public authority, and has its determinate value fixed by governments....” Black’s 3 rd . See Note. Note : Try as it may, Big Brother cannot completely disguise the true meaning of the word public . The leopard cannot change its spots. There is nothing altruistic about contemporary employment of the term. As is discernible from its 1933 usage in Black’s 3 rd in the last definition above, the real meaning of “ public ” is government . 184 Add the following definition and modify “Note” under “ VALUE ”as follows: “The utility of an object in satisfying, directly or indirectly, the needs or desires of human beings, c alled by economists ‘ value in use;’ [sic] or its worth consisting in the power of purchasing other objects, called ‘ value in exchange.’ Also the estimated or appraised worth of any object of property, calculated in money.” Black’s 3 rd . Note: There was a time in America when the currency represented value because it could be exchanged for a fixed amount of precious metal (gold/silver). When we lost the gold standard, the definition of value had to be debauched so as to accommodate the new valueless “mon ey,” Federal Reserve Notes. This perversion of the term is evidenced clearly by comparing the Black’s 3 rd (1933) definition of value and the UCC definition (2002). A necessary provision of law is “remedy” ( see remedy ). Modern operation of “Acceptance Fo r Value ” is, by deduction, remedy .

O c t . 2002 Handling Presentments – Instructions I. Introduction . A. Understanding presentments . The dictionary definition of presentment concerns both criminal matters and financial matters, and descriptive terms within the definition of each type are synonymous for the most part. Presentments fall into two categories, demands for payment and demands for acceptance ( of responsibility for payment/performance ), defined as follows: ? “ A formal written accusation returned by a grand jury on its own initiative, without a pr osecutor’s previous indictment request. “A grand jury has only two functions, either to indict or to return a ‘no bill.’ The Constitution speaks also of a ‘ presentment ,’ but this is a term with a distinct historical meaning now not well understood. Hi storically presentment was the process by which a grand jury initiated an independent investigation and asked that a charge be drawn to cover the facts should they constitute a crime. With United States attorneys now always available to advise grand jurie s, proceeding by presentment is now an outmoded practice. Charles Alan Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure § 110, at 459 (3rd ed. 1999).” Black’s Law Dictionary , Seventh Edition (1999) hereinafter “ Black’s 7 th .” ( Bold emphasis added) ? “ The formal prod uction of a negotiable instrument for acceptance or payment. “ Presentment and dishonor occur, for instance, when the holder of a check attempts to cash it at the drawee 1 bank but payment is refused because the drawer lacks sufficient funds on deposit. T he demand for payment is the presentment . The bank’s refusal to pay is dishonor. James J. White & Robert S. Summers, Uniform Commercial Code, § 16 - 8, at 100 (4th ed. 1995).” Black’s 7 th . ( Bold emphasis added) ? “ Presentment is a demand for acceptance or payment made upon the maker, acceptor, drawee or other payor by or on behalf of the holder. U.C.C. § 3 - 504(1).” Black’s Law Dictionary , Sixth Edition (1990), hereinafter “ Black’s 6 th .” ( Bold emphasis added) In criminal matters, a bill , i.e. charges (lik e financial charges), in the form of a formal written accusation of a crime called an indictment (presentment), is presented to a court (by the prosecutor) for prosecution. A true bill is a list of charges that is sworn “true, correct, and complete” (affi davit) by a grand jury. Based on the sworn charges of the grand jury, the prosecutor is indemnified for whatever action he takes based thereon. The prosecutor then draws up his own presentment, called a criminal complaint, based on the indictment (true b ill) and demands that the named party accept responsibility for the charges.    1 Drawee: One to whom a bill of exchange or a check directs a request to pay a certain sum of money specified therein. In the typical checking account situation, the bank is the drawee, the person writing the check is the maker or drawer, and the person to whom the check is written is the payee.

O c t . 2002 Because of the U.S. bankruptcy and the institutionalization of fiat (“by decree”) money called Federal Reserve Notes , “FRNs,” there have been commensurate changes in the realm of jurisprudence. American tribunals are now “Federal - Reserve - Note tribunals,” dealing exclusively in FRNs and enforcing the private, copyrighted, corporate policy of the owners of the FRNs, known as “Code” (all U.S. code/law is copyrighted by British corpo rations — see Footnote 13 on page 41 of “The Truth About Esquires,” for details). Notice in the quoted case under the first definition above that because of the influence of United States Attorneys, “proceeding by presentment [of the grand jury] is now an outmoded practice.” We now operate in “summary proceeding” in the vast majority of legal undertakings in America, traffic court being the most common: “Summary proceeding. Any proceeding by which a controversy is settled, case disposed of, or trial condu cted, in a prompt and simple manner, without the aid of a jury, without presentment of indictment , or in other aspects out of the regular course of the common law. Black’s Law Dictionary , First Edition (1891), hereinafter “ Black’s 1 st .” ( Underline emphas is added) A “demand for acceptance ” is a demand for acceptance of responsibility (for payment, or for performance of some act, and may also entail payment of some kind at a later date). A traffic ticket is a combination criminal/ financial instrument. The traffic cop issues an order and the motorist makes a promise . Negotiable instruments consist strictly of orders to pay and promises to pay — and traffic tickets are negotiable instruments. The cop issues an order for acceptance (of responsibility to pa y) against the credit of the TRADE NAME, and the motorist signs a promise to (accept responsibility for the charge, and) appear (and, if necessary, pay the ticket ). If the motorist fails to accept responsibility for the ultimate payment of the ticket at a ny point in the process, he is arrested and jailed (put in debtors’ prison) . When anyone in government demands that you accept responsibility to perform some act, he is issuing a presentment, concerning which there are monetary charges associated with a f ailure to perform said act . Presentments come in oral, written, and electronic form; acceptance of any presentment executes a contract. In the private sector, presentments usually come from attorneys, but since all attorneys are officers of the state, 2 we are faced with essentially the same situation. The court system would not be a profitable enterprise without attorneys, who are endowed with a special “property right” ( right to practice law), granted a title of nobility (esquire) via letters patent, 3 and elevated above “common men” (fees enforced by judicial decree, win or lose), in exchange for bird - dogging “customers” into the courtroom . In order to issue a presentment, a prospective issuer must have an account , where a charge can be lodged. For exa mple, if police cannot determine the TRADE NAME of a detainee (party held for questioning) within a brief period of time they must release him. The TRADE NAME is the account name under which a sovereign conducts business —   2 “An attorney is an officer of the court, and as such, an officer and arm of the state.” 7 Corpus Juris Secundum 4, Virgin Islands Bar Assoc iation v. Dench , D.C. Virgin Islands, 124 F. Supp. 257. 3 “ Letters patent , an open document under seal of the government, granting some special right, authority, privilege, or property, or conferring some title...” A Standard Dictionary of the English Langu age , Funk & Wagnalls Company, 1903."},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"Handling Presentments – Instructions Page 3 of 21 Rev. O c t . 2002 albeit unwittingly. The TRADE NAM E, as well as the true name, comprises property . 4 Registration of your TRADE NAME (via birth, etc .) constitutes the voluntary surrender of legal title/custody of the property and establishment of an account. When a government actor says, “May I have your name, please?” he is literally asking you to turn over your property, the TRADE NAME, for him to use however he pleases, and to charge the account. 5 The flesh - and - blood man, as surety for the party in whose name the account appears, is held accountable for any charges leveled against the TRADE NAME. The reason criminal and financial charges seem to run together, overlap, and mirror the other is that they are both commercial 6 in nature. This is the admiralty jurisdiction mentioned in Part I (Theory) of this manual. In admiralty, the military (the executive branch, in its many forms) is used to enforce criminal penalties for civil offenses. The moneychanger - merchants have foreclosed on the U.S. Government and use it liberally, via the chief executive to prosecute their own private commercial interests. We are under military rule, literally by the commander - in - chief of the military, not the president. 7 A primary reason for the broad appeal and workability of the common law is that each man is in control of his own destiny in the social scheme: as long as he does not harm another — and thereby form a contract with an obligation — he is free to live his life as he sees fit, without interference from government. These days, however, people are penalized for an act even when no one is harmed and no property is damaged, e.g. traveling at 35 miles per hour in a 30 - miles - per - hour zone. The police power is thereby employed for penalizing behavior (such as “thought crimes”) — not acts and deeds of substance — for the pur pose of raising revenue. When someone violates his own sense of moral rightness in his conduct as a member of society, no matter how justified, he is weakened under the police power of the state. For this reason, it is a good idea to reassess your life as you embark on this stage of the journey and begin using and relying on the power of the documents and processes offered herein — which is formidable — and make sure that you are giving yourself the best chance for a worry - free existence. Betraying your own sense of fair play is the quickest way to undermine all progress. In the end, it is your own sense of decency, ethical behavior, and honest interaction with others that determines your fate. Just by trying to do the right thing on a moment - to - moment bas is brings about clarity of perception not otherwise available, and can easily turn out to be your saving grace in a time of need. These documents are all based on the power of the common law, private property rights, and consensual contracts, and are enor mously successful in crushing assaults on your fiscal integrity. Their efficacy has been acknowledged at both the lowest and very highest levels of government in this country. They have changed the course of every proceeding in which they were introduced , including criminal cases where the accused was already convicted. That is because the common law still exists and is in   4 Because of the disappearance of substance money — where each man is accountable and there is no private “limited liability” — we now have a mutant financial system that runs strictly on accounting principles, because all “ money” is artificial (no substance/reality, as with gold) and debt can no longer be extinguished, but merely “discharged.” 5 See “Letter for State Registrar re Birth Certificate” in Appendix for one approach to thwart governmental monopolization of the use of your name, both True Name and TRADE NAME, in forming accounts. 6 See “Crime is Commerce,” 27 CFR 721.11, in Appendix . 7 See subsection entitled “Co - Suretyship Obligations Incurred Via Acceptance of Free Delivery of Mail” in Section 3, “The Curse of Co - Suretyship.”"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"Handling Presentments – Instructions Page 4 of 21 Rev.

People have been so severely hoodwinked that many do not even believe there is hope of rev ersing the oppressive, all - engulfing practices of the system. There is hope. It lies in the common law and in your ability to maintain in the face of the mendacious 8 bent of Big Brother’s operatives. B. Scope of presentment - handling documents contained herein . What has taken many thousands of dedicated collaborators over thousands of years to put into position will not be fully unraveled in a few hundred pages of exposition — nor do we pretend to be able to fully accomplish such a feat. We do, however, get results, and consistently, because our approach is based on the timeless principles of human dignity and interaction as embodied in, primarily, the common law. The Chosen Masters are not pleased that their wealth - confiscation and freedom - usurpation ma chinery can be rendered ineffective, and even more upset that their own device (the UCC) can be used to victimize them . Even when you are completely right, a presenter will sometimes go down kicking and screaming all the way, abusing his influence over th e utterly corrupt judicial system and its army of charlatan - whore esquires to challenge every shred of knowledge about what you are doing. Because such actors are inherently dishonest, they have weaknesses that can be exploited. The documents as offer ed herein have paved the way for stopping collection activity by effecting strict (non - judicial) foreclosure against those who would happily swindle you out of everything you own. However, this manual does not propose to be able to guide someone through t he legal minefields that can arise when one goes to foreclose, but there are people who can assist when it comes time for finishing off the job. It is one thing to be able to stop a collection proceeding; it is quite another to foreclose on the erstwhile “forecloser,” but it can be done. Instructions for such enterprise are not included herein, however. Please contact UCC Services Group at www.uccsg.com for a referral when this time arrives. C. A note on pressure sit uations and criminal cases . The material set forth herein is private in nature. There is no attempt to give legal advice of any kind because we are not licensed to dispense such. This material may be applied, however, in any circumstance where your priv ate, common - law - copyrighted property is being used for commercial gain without your authorization. You are the only one who can decide what should be done. If you are faced with a pressure situation, a demand for a signature, or even a criminal charge, y ou can still take action in the non - statutory (non - judicial) realm against the individual players coming against you, by using the private, contractual, consensual measures set forth in the items at the end of this Section, beginning on page 18 of these in structions, under Part VII, “Protecting Oneself in Pressure Situations and Criminal Proceedings.” One essay in particular, “How to Sign Your Signature Without Liability,” proves utterly the correctness of what we are doing here. II. Creating Your Response Documents for Handling Presentments . A. Demands for acceptance . Such presentments are generally from government agents and officers, but can also come from attorneys and individuals (“citizen of the United States” TRADE NAMES), and basically constitute u nauthorized use of your common - law - copyrighted property. Regardless of the fact that there may be potential criminal penalties and fines associated with the presentment if from a government actor, you   8 Mendacious: Addicted to lying; characterized by deceit; false."},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"Handling Presentments – Instructions Page 5 of 21 Rev.

This is strictly a private matter between you and any party who is using your property for financial gain without your authorization. 1. “Notice by Written Communication/Security Agreement” . Entitled in non - judicial terms so as to align with tenets of the Uniform Commercial Code, the “Notice by Written Communication/Security Agreement,” hereinafter “Notice by Written Communication,” is recommended f or handling presentments that do not demand immediate payment of money. The document is: self - explanatory; contains no judicial/statutory jargon; consists of everyday, common - law language; and is written with a mind toward augmenting the non - judicial fore closure process of the UCC once the debtor defaults on payment after being invoiced for charges (in the form of a “Verified Statement of Account” — see page 309 — private equivalent of a grand jury’s true bill ). It is used against those who issue presentments demanding acceptance (of responsibility for specific performance, or for payment at a later date). 2. Converting sample document . As with all other documents in this manual, there is no other way to generate your personal Notice by Written Communication o n your own other than by going through the sample document word - by - word, learning as you go, and replacing John Henry Doe’s information with yours. 3. Mode of sending . We always use Registered Mail, sent “Restricted Delivery,” “Return Receipt Requested” ( PS Form 3811, the “Green Card”), with an Affidavit of Mailing, exclusively — but (as always) final choice rests with you. 4. Important: Optional text in two segments . There are two versions of “Procedure to Opt Out of Consensual Contract” on page 2 of the No tice by Written Communication, and a subsequent segment, entitled “Self - executing Security Agreement.” You will need to choose between the two options each time a presentment comes your way. Basically, the first one gives the unauthorized user a quick an d easy way out, with no muss and no fuss, thus ending the confrontation. The second is far more stringent and really puts the unauthorized user in a pickle, and it is doubtful if he/she will get out of it. Note: You are not prohibited from adjusting this paragraph however you see fit, but if you make changes you should be absolutely certain that they do not contain any statutory/judicial language, and that the parameters that you set are in harmony with the UCC for non - judicial foreclosure (also known as strict foreclosure ). (a) Simple opt - out procedure (with subsequent “Self - executing” paragraph) .

O c t . 2002 B. Validation of debt package: “Respondent’s Private, International, Administrative Remedy D emand” . Presentments demanding payment are the most common because the current financial system is expressly designed to generate defaults, foreclosures, and bankruptcies. “Civilization” is on a conveyor belt to Hell, courtesy of the instigator - owners of the duplicitous banking system. Using government agents called “attorneys at law,” people are sitting ducks against the might of the state as concentrated in the judge - attorney Brotherhood. There are a few Achilles’ heels, however, and “Respondent’s Pri vate, International, Administrative Remedy Demand,” hereinafter “Administrative Remedy Demand,” exploits one of them. 1. Loans of credit . Credit lenders flourish only because of interest payments: the “borrower” is always the source of the principal amoun t of any alleged loan by virtue of his “promise to pay” (promissory note, credit application), which becomes a negotiable instrument, i.e. “money,” per UCC 3 - 104, which the credit lender then converts into another form (bank draft, cashier’s check) — in acco rdance with Federal Reserve “lending” policies — and reissues, calling it the “loan.” This is strictly an accounting procedure: the bank loans nothing of substance, indeed is forbidden to loan true assets of any kind by banking regulations. This can all be verified with any certified public accountant. Credit lenders do not profit from the principal loan amount, only the interest. This is why on many loans, and in all mortgage contracts, the “borrower” makes payments on interest - charges only for the fir st many years. This is all gravy for credit lenders. 9 The principal amount never comes into play for the financial institution because that sum is always the property of the “borrower,” and remains so till the end of the cycle, even if the so - called “loa n” is never paid off. “Loans” that end in default are simply charged off, i.e. discharged by bookkeeping entry, with no loss incurred by the bank — which is the precise reason that the techniques delineated in this Section are effective in nullifying demand s for payment from debt collectors: no risk in the loan process = no valid claim. Banks, mortgage companies, and credit card companies lend only credit : from the Latin credere : believe, trust. Credit lenders believe in you and trust that you will make al l interest payments as you have been “legally” suckered into. The entire American financial system, engineered and developed into its current state over the last 2,000+ years by the Chosen Masters, 10 is an exercise in deceit and treachery of incomprehensib le magnitude, predicated on the willful and wanton wholesale destruction of the life of one and all and the peace and dignity of mankind based on the worship of money (wealth, mammon) and a psychotic impulse to subjugate and dominate the existence of all o thers. 2. Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) . Per the Act, as codified at 15 USC §1692 et seq., 11 and as abundantly pointed out within Administrative Remedy Demand, a debt collector 12 must, if requested, provide a verification of the alleged debt, i.e. validate the debt. Per FDCPA, the debt collector is mandated to cease all collection activity until verification is provided.    9 On a limited basis, bankers generally make more money during holidays when the bank is closed than when the bank is open because there is much less overhead, and interest cha rges continue accruing seven days a week. 10 See Section 2, “The Truth About Esquires,” beginning at the segment entitled “An Indispensable Tool of the Chosen Masters” on page 59 , through “Masters of Commerce and Law,” which ends on page 64 . 11 Et seq. : An abbreviation for et sequentia , “and the following.” Thus a reference to “p. 1, et seq .,” means “page first and the following pages.” Black’s 1 st . 12 As defined in FDCPA, a debt collector is one who is collecting a debt for another. "},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"Handling Presentments – Instructions Page 8 of 21 Rev. O c t . 2002 (a) Verification/Validation . Verification is defined as: “ Confirmation of correctness, truth, or authenticity, by affidavit, oath, or deposition. Affidavit of truth of matter stated and object of verification is to assure good faith in averments or statements of party.” Black’s 6 th . What this means is, the debt collector must swear “true, correct, and complete” (equivalent of “the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,” i.e. testimony) that verifies exchange of valuable consideration that allows the debt collector to demand payment. A sworn affidavit that simply verifies “all balances due,” cites that “correct bill ing procedures were followed,” and other such poppycock is irrelevant. The debt collector must verify the consideration (substance) provided the alleged debtor that validates the debt collector’s claim of debt. Since the alleged debtor received no consid eration from the debt collector (and likewise from the original creditor), the debt collector is foreclosed from truthfully claiming such in a sworn affidavit. This is why IRS prosecutes for Failure to File an Income Tax Return : a sworn Form 1040 is a val idation of the debt. IRS is a debt - collection agency. IRS cannot substantiate any debt unless IRS has a sworn statement from the taxpayer that validates the debt. As cited above, banks do not loan substance, only credit (air). No third - party - de bt - collector attorney, and no other debt collector, has any knowledge of a loan of substance (valuable consideration) ; hence such are foreclosed from issuing a counter - affidavit of any relevance. The system is fraudulent by nature, and cannot be made legi timate by false affidavit. The truth is, the only one who can validate a debt is the borrower . (b) Parties exempted from FDCPA . Government officials (IRS personnel are not government officials) and in - house debt - collection personnel of an original creditor are exempted from FDCPA. However, per public policy as codified House Joint Resolution 192 of June 5, 1933, no one can require payment in “a particular kind of coin or currency.” I.e. no one can require payment in Federal Reserve Notes, “FRNs,” includin g government collectors and original creditors . This is why you find the statement, “MUST BE PAID IN U.S. FUNDS,” on parking tickets and other demands for payment: there is more than one kind of “U.S. FUNDS.” If FRNs were the only kind of “U.S. FUNDS,” t he statement would read “MUST BE PAID IN FEDERAL RESERVE NOTES,” but this is not the case. If your signed promissory note (negotiable instrument; “U.S. FUNDS”) can be used to fund a so - called “loan” from the bank at the beginning of the process, it is no less legitimate a source of funds at a later point in the cycle. So, even though government officials and in - house collection personnel of an original creditor are not required to validate the debt, per public policy any bona fide negotiable instrument di scharges a debt. The usefulness of the “Certified Promissory Note” on page 304 should be coming into focus. Many times the corporate entity seeking to collect the debt will have a name that bears similarity with that of the original corporate creditor, wh ich is exempt from FDCPA. If the name of the collector’s principal is not the exact same name as that of the original creditor, you are dealing with a different corporate entity — a debt collector who is bound by the provisions of FDCPA. If you are uncerta in if it is the original creditor demanding payment, go ahead and treat any such"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"Handling Presentments – Instructions Page 9 of 21 Rev. O c t . 2002 personnel as a debt collector (in your written communication). Tender of payment is rendered no less valid even if one is dealing with the original creditor. 3. Other avenues of attack . As well as the impossibility of providing a bona fide verification of the debt, debt collectors are hit with other constraints besides FDCPA: (a) Privacy Act of 1974, as lawfully amended, 12 U.S.C. § 3401; (b) Right To Financial Privacy Act of 1978, as lawfully amended, 5 U.S.C. § 552a; and (c) Third Party Summons Act, special procedures, 26 U.S.C. § 7609. 4. Line - up of component documents within the Administrative Remedy Demand . The package is a combination of documents of many avenues of attack, any one of which is sufficient to stop the entire proceeding: (a) Internal “Notice by Written Communication” . Same Notice by Written Communication used with demands for acceptance, except that: (i) It is specially enclosed in its own box within the A dministrative Remedy Demand, and therefore legally separate from the main document; and (ii) Secured party is the author, not the debtor - TRADE NAME (as with the other documents) , recipient incurs a $500,000.00 unauthorized - use fee for each and every subseq uent use of the name after having been noticed (enough encouragement to cease all further communication in itself); and (iii) The Privacy Act Notice further restricts options for the debt collector. (b) Notice of Tender of Payment . Gives official notice tha t payment has been tendered. See (d)(ii) immediately below for customizing certain data. (c) Sworn Offer of Performance . Tells debt collector that if debt collector can prove that the debt exists, i.e. verify/validate the debt, debt collector may retain the accompanying payment submitted in the form of a Certified Promissory Note (bona fide negotiable instrument, per UCC 3 - 104). See 4(d)(ii) immediately below for customizing certain data within this document. (d) Certified Promissory Note . Fulfills the legal de finition of a negotiable instrument per UCC 3 - 104 and discharges any alleged debt, if said alleged debt is verified/validated (which it is not). This is merely a “promise to pay” and not a sight draft, forged document, bogus instrument, etc. (i) If poss ible, use “certificate paper” to print up the Note; and (ii) Find debt collector’s internal data appearing on the presentment and plug these data into the Note. Examples are “Alleged Market Code,” “Alleged ‘Our File No.,’” “Alleged FHA Case,” “Alleged Loa n No.,” etc . In other words, customize the Promissory Note, and the other two documents within this package that mention same ( i.e. 4(b), Notice of Tender of Payment, and 4(c), Offer of Performance, immediately above) using the data contained within the p resentment."},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"Handling Presentments – Instructions Page 10 of 21 Rev. O c t . 2002 (e) Sworn and witnessed Verification of Tender of Payment . Proof of tender of payment. Under public policy (House Joint Resolution 192 of June 5, 1933), a debt is discharged upon tender of payment, even if it is not accepted. 13 (f) Debt Collector Dis closure Statement . Contains numerous lawful requests for information, all of which debt collector is obligated to provide, any one of which can invalidate debt collector’s attempt to collect on his bogus claim. III. Sending Your Written Communication . A. Selecting the correct party to receive your written communication . 1. Re computer printouts . We do not recommend corresponding with computers, but it is important to respond. If you get a computer - generated presentment, call up the sender organizat ion, feign a cooperative attitude, and find someone who will either admit that he/she sent you the computer print - out, or will issue another with his/her name on it. If you have no name, use the appropriate senior executive within the organization. Hopef ully you will not see many of these. 2. Notice by Written Communication . Goes to: (a) Any party (governmental or non - governmental) demanding acceptance (of responsibility for specific performance/possible payment at a later date — but, generally, not demandi ng immediate payment), as well as: (i) The appropriate senior official/executive over any such party; and (ii) The principal/employer (e.g. bank, law firm, etc.) of any such party; and (b) Any government official demanding payment (e.g. county tax assessor d emanding property taxes). Government officials are exempt from the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and therefore would not be sent a “Validation of Debt” package ( see paragraph “3” below). IRS personnel, however, are not government officials, do not e njoy such immunity, are not so - exempted, and therefore would be sent a “Validation of Debt” package. In the case of a bona fide government official demanding payment, send a Notice by Written Communication along with the normal attachments, plus the follo wing: (i) “Offer of Performance” ( see page 302); (ii) “Certified Promissory Note” ( see page 304); and (iii) “Verification of Tender of Payment” ( see page 305); and (c) Any appropriate senior official/executive over, as well as the principal/employer of, any party who is sent a “Validation of Debt” package (below). 3. “ Validation of Debt” package — the Administrative Remedy Demand . Used to handle non - government and non - in - house collection personnel demanding payment for loans of credit and other unsubstantiate d, non - governmental debt of some type, e.g. income taxes — as long as you have not already inadvertently validated the debt by sworn statement.   13 For exposé on “money ” and discharge of debt, see House Joint Resolution 192 of June 5, 1933 in Glossary ."},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"Handling Presentments – Instructions Page 11 of 21 Rev. O c t . 2002 (a) Proper usage . This package will not work when a creditor has given you substance in exchange for your promise to pay; only credit . An example of this is buying a used car from a dealer who does not use an outside creditor, but carries the paper himself. He can validate the debt because he personally gave you substance. If the same dealer were to obtain financing f or you from a credit lender who later attempted strict foreclosure, the so - called “credit lender” could be defeated — because he incurred no risk of loss in the transaction; only the “loss” of anticipated gain (invalid claim). (i) Important note on auto loa ns . Contemporary auto loans are issued with the proviso that the “lender” can take the car (strict foreclosure) if you fail to make payments as agreed. However, if you loaned the car, are out of town ( but not out of the state ) on business, vacation, etc. 14 they have no way to enforce this clause (they can only sue for the alleged balance, plus costs and attorney fees). It is a good idea to keep this in mind until the matter is concluded — because they will swipe the car if given half a chance , thus forcing you to deal with their tag - team partners down at the local courthouse if you want to get the car back without forking over Federal Reserve Notes. (b) You are current on your payments, but want to terminate the loan anyway . In this circumstance you can call in and ask for a “payoff balance.” Written notification of a payoff balance is not a presentment (not a demand), but can be used to ascertain a correct dollar - figure. Request a payoff balance that is good until a certain date (2 – 3 weeks from date requested). Inform the agent that you need the balance in writing (not verbally), and you need someone to verify the figure because you do not want them coming back afterwards and saying, “Oh, there is this other charge we forgot to mention,” etc . Just tell him you need written verification by a responsible party that the payoff balance is accurate. He should have no problem complying. (i) Correct recipient for sending in payoff balance . Even though you have a verified payoff balance, the sender will g enerally not know what to do with the Certified Promissory Note. However, there is another officer that is well acquainted with such: the head of the collection department. For this reason, it is best to send your package to the head of the collection de partment . Since a payoff balance is not a presentment, re - word pertinent mentions of “Presentment” to read “Written Communication.” (c) Behind on payments; threats of foreclosure . Even in extreme circumstances, credit lenders like to refrain from sending out actual presentments. They especially like to withhold the name of the agent sending the correspondence, instead using the name of the principal (the name of organization, a generality), a department within it, etc ., instead of that of the flesh - and - blood man/woman. The purpose is to get you into the eleventh hour and then bring in a government agent, i.e. an attorney, to finish you off. Use any available written communication (presentment, monthly statement, etc.) and request validation the debt. If an outside attorney/law firm threatens to sue/sues on behalf of an alleged creditor, it is safest (in case the collector is also the original creditor) to send the attorney/law firm its own VOD Package, with a new promissory note and debt -   14 The “lender’s” inability to locate the car does not automatically constitute fraudulent concealment of collateral."},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"Handling Presentments – Instructions Page 12 of 21 Rev. O c t . 2002 validation request. All collection activity must cease — at least according to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act — until said validation is provided. However, shyster judges and attorneys do not like being told that they can no longer pillage and plunder as they have for their entire career, and may try other tactics to get you to trip up. Keep putting their nose back into the validation. (d) Courts and attorneys that ignore the FDCPA requirement to validate . This issue cannot be addressed in this manual because neither we, nor the publisher, are licensed to practice law and, accordingly, do not give out legal advice. However, if you run into such a situation, the folks at www.uccsg.com may be able to recommend a consultant that can assi st you. IV. Preparing Your Package for Transmittal . A. Copyright notations . Please always consult sample filings for proper display of copyright notations for both True Name © and TRADE NAME © . Each time either name appears within your documents (excep t in entry - designations in the “Glossary of Terms”) it should always be qualified with one of the following: 1. Superscripted copyright symbol . The symbol, i.e. “ © ,” is touching the last letter of the surname for both True Name © and TRADE NAME © when not s et in quotes. 2. Quotation marks . True Name © and TRADE NAME © should be set in quotation marks when the superscripted copyright symbol is not used; B. Signatures . Closely follow sample documents when applying a signature. Vital note re all signatures: see “How to Sign Your Signature Without Liability” in this Section. 1. True Name © . More closely approximates who you are than TRADE NAME; always sign in red ink (symbolizing the blood of a living, breathing man/woman). 2. TRADE NAME © . Should always be p rinted in capital letters, preferably in blue ink for ease of identifying the original document (black ink can sometimes be indistinguishable from a photocopy without close examination). 3. Witnesses . Have your witnesses sign their normal, cursive (longha nd) signature in blue ink, where needed. Not necessary for your witnesses to have a copyright symbol with their signature (but nothing prohibiting it either). C. Attachments . Attach a copy of the following with both the five - page, stand - alone Notice by W ritten Communication and the 14 - page, Validation of Debt package: 1. Presentment/payoff - balance document (when using a payoff - balance document, be certain to replace the term “Presentment” with “Written Communication” so the payoff - balance document is pro perly identified and not misnamed). 2. Affidavit of Publishing (from the newspaper) of your Copyright Notice. 3. Filed UCC Financing Statement . Re your financing statement, please also note: (a) There will be more than one financing statement/amendment t o be attached if you have done a cross - filing; and"},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"Handling Presentments – Instructions Page 13 of 21 Rev. O c t . 2002 (b) For those handling a mortgage situation: (i) Be certain to use the financing statement filed at county (not state) level; and (ii) Based on what is at stake, it is not a bad idea to use a certified copy ( use the “Copy Certification by Document Custodian” form) of your filed financing statement rather than a plain photocopy. 4. Private Agreement . 5. Hold - harmless and Indemnity Agreement . 6. Security Agreement . D. Debtor name and address notation at top of p age . Place debtor’s TRADE NAME, military style, in top, left - hand corner of page (generally a requirement for inclusion of an attachment page in a filing). E. Photocopy entire final stack of signed documents before sending . Once you have fully assembled the entire package, make a photocopy of everything, staple both sets, place the original in the envelope for mailing, and file the copy in your records. F. Registered Mail envelope and mailing . Best procedure for using Registered Mail is described in th e instructions appearing at the top of sample Registered Mail receipt on page 293. Please read these instructions before sending by Registered Mail. (a) Return Receipt Requested . Provides a signature and date of receipt of package by recipient. Proof that the package was received. (b) Restricted Delivery . Check this box and pay the extra fee. More evidence of full disclosure on your part and, hopefully, an original receipt signed by the debtor. (c) Affidavit of Mailing . Proof of the contents of the envelope; an indispensable component in the process of proving your position and effecting foreclosure on any unauthorized user. Always have someone do an Affidavit of Mailing in these matters. Proof that recipient actually received the package is then uncontestable. Mail the original Affidavit of Mailing; retain a photocopy for your records. V. How to Deal With Former Creditors After Paying by Promissory Note . A. Typical responses . There are a couple of typical responses that a former creditor will give upon rece ipt of a certified promissory note: 1. Congratulatory letter for paying off the loan; 2. Urgent phone calls, phone messages, or correspondence asserting, demanding, or pleading that you call them and speak with them immediately. B. Former obligation is di scharged . People can be tricked and conned into unwittingly re - accepting the obligation if they discuss anything with a former alleged creditor/debt collector once the promissory note has been tendered. The debt is discharged upon tender of the instrumen t; it matters not it is accepted or rejected ( see UCC 3 - 603)."},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"Handling Presentments – Instructions Page 14 of 21 Rev. O c t . 2002 Typically, the such will seek a telephone conversation to try to convince the former alleged debtor that the debt must be paid in Federal Reserve Notes, “FRNs.” Per public policy at House Join t Resolution 192 of June 5, 1933, nobody has any obligation to pay in FRNs . The promissory note is a negotiable instrument (money) constructed in strict accordance with the UCC (§ 3 - 104), and legally discharges the debt. Once tendered, the debt is discha rged. Period. C. Vital information . There is no good that can come from discussing a former alleged debt with a former alleged creditor/debt collector after payment has been tendered . D. Handling phone calls from former creditors . 1. Sample telephone con versation . Former creditor: Is this JOHN DOE? John Henry Doe: Who’s calling? Former creditor: This is JACK from Bank of Texas. Is this JOHN DOE? John Henry Doe: What’s the purpose of the call? Former creditor: I need to speak with JOHN DOE about a pa yment we recently received on his... John Henry Doe: I don’t do business over the phone, JACK. If you could put your questions in writing and send me a letter I would be happy to take a look at them. Former creditor: I just want to go over a couple of thing s... John Henry Doe: Like I said, I don’t do business over the phone. If you will kindly put your questions in writing I will have a look at them. Former creditor: I understand, MR. DOE, but this will only take a few minutes, if I could just ask you... John Henry Doe: I’m being as clear as I can, JACK. I only deal with such matters in writing. Former creditor: You’ve made that very clear to me MR. DOE, but the thing is your last payment on the... John Henry Doe: What is your surname name, JACK? Former credito r: I don’t give out my last name . John Henry Doe: Sorry, JACK, but if you’re not willing to tell me who you are I am not willing to continue this conversation. I’m hanging up now, JACK. Former creditor: Wait, MR. DOE! Why do you need my last name? John Henry Doe: Good - bye, JACK. Former creditor: Wait! Wait! OK, my last name is “JONES.” John Henry Doe: Home address? Former creditor: “Home address”? Why do you need my home address? John Henry Doe: I need to know where to send the bill."},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"Handling Presentments – Instructions Page 15 of 21 Rev. O c t . 2002 Former creditor: What bill? John Henry Doe: The bill for the use of my property. Former creditor: What are you talking about? John Henry Doe: I need your address so I can send you a bill for the use of my property. Former creditor: Whatever are you referring to, MR. DOE? John Henry Doe: The name you have been using in this conversation to address me is private, copyrighted property. So far in this conversation you have used my property seven different times without my authorization. I need to bill you for the use of my c opyrighted property. I prefer sending the bill to your home, rather than at the bank. Home address, please? Former creditor: You’ve got to be kidding. John Henry Doe: I’m not kidding, JACK. If you’re not willing to provide your home address this conver sation is over. Former creditor: You’ll be hearing from us, MR. DOE (“click”). 2. Your objective . Take it as far as necessary to get the caller to hang up. If he gives you his home address, ask him for his home phone number. If he gives you his home phone number, ask for his Social Security Account Number, “SSAN”; tell him that you don’t know who he is and that you need to cross - check all the previous data he gave you with the SSAN. He will not call you again. 3. Caller’s objective . Someone else mig ht call again at a later time, but it will be the same story. The debt is discharged and their legal department knows it. They are only calling for the purpose of trying to persuade you that you can only pay in FRNs. If you actually mistakenly engaged i n conversation with the caller, he/she would try to make you feel bad and scare you with bogus threats. Anyone who is assigned to call you after you have sent in such an instrument knows exactly what he/she is doing and has been briefed on how to get you to pay in FRNs. Handle any such caller as above and he/she will stop calling. 4. Key points to remember . (a) Never answer a question; (b) Never identify yourself; (c) Never discuss anything that the caller brings up; (d) Always interrupt if the caller pursues a c onversation/questions you after having been noticed that you don’t do business over the phone; (e) There is no need to be hostile, but you must be firm and not tolerate any attempts at getting you into a conversation; and (f) Do not consent with anything the calle r wants. You can even tell him/her that you do not consent with him/her using your copyrighted property, using your telephone number, calling you at home, etc ."},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"Handling Presentments – Instructions Page 16 of 21 Rev. O c t . 2002 E. Correspondence urging you to call . The choice is yours, but anyone who uses your copyrighte d property (for profit) deserves a Notice by Written Communication. F. If you receive a presentment (demand for payment) afterwards . If a follow - up presentment comes in the mail, you should: 1. Mail the sender (agent) a personalized Notice by Written Comm unication/ Security Agreement, and a copy of the served, 14 - page Administrative Remedy Demand and its proof of mailing (Green Card and Affidavit of Mailing); and 2. If you also served the principal with notice of the fees for use of your private property, you may commence the collection process on the principal using the last correspondence (presentment or not) as proof of execution of the contract. 15 These instructions begin in part VI immediately below. VI. Steps to Take After Execution of Consensual Co ntract by Unauthorized User . A. How and when the contract is executed . It is vital that you recognize the moment the presenter/debt collector executes the consensual contract and incurs the obligation. For this reason you need to be familiar with the e veryday language in the “Notice by Written Communication” that spells out the non - judicial terms of the contract for use of your common - law - copyrighted property. A presenter/debt collector can voluntarily enter the consensual contract and incur the obliga tion in either of the following ways: 1. For both simple - and difficult - opt - out procedure : Any single instance of additional use of True Name or TRADE NAME for commercial gain after having been noticed; 2. For difficult - opt - out procedure only : Debtor’s fai lure to surrender all originals and all copies of any and all records in any form of recorded media (written, electronic, magnetic tape) containing your common - law - copyrighted property within 72 hours of midnight the day after debtor was noticed. B. Steps immediately after presenter/debt collector executes consensual contract . 1. Begin locating debtor’s assets . Your security interest in the debtor’s property is perfected by filing a UCC Financing Statement at state level, and, in the case of real estate holdings, at county level. It is best to itemize all of debtor’s property in the financing statement — and all real estate filings require the legal description of the property be entered in Box 14 on the Addendum page. Do whatever you can to begin locatin g all of debtor’s property as soon as possible (UCC Services Group can assist you in this task). 2. Generate the “Invoice – Verified Statement of Account” . Immediately upon presenter’s/debt collector’s execution of the consensual contract, draw up an invoice to bill your new debtor for the unauthorized use of your property. This is a dollar - figure calculated by multiplying the total number of uses of your True Name and TRADE NAME in this particular collection cycle only, both before and after debtor was noticed , by $500,000.00. Debtor had the chance to opt out and walk away, but chose to go forward and challenge your right of ownership of your own property. Once the contract is executed, all earlier unauthorized uses of your property in this   15 If the matter is entered into the court as a compl aint, it can still be successfully resolved. We are not licensed to practice law, but UCC Services Group may be able to suggest a consultant who can assist you."},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"Handling Presentments – Instructions Page 17 of 21 Rev. O c t . 2002 particu lar collection cycle become billable; debtor is accountable for each one. When you plug in your particulars in the sample Invoice, be sure you: (a) Precisely identify the document(s) and the number of uses of your property; (b) Make an exact accounting of the num ber of unauthorized uses of your property, leaving no margin for error ; and (c) Make certain that you can back up — with verifiable, bona fide, documentary evidence — everything that is stated in the Invoice regarding unauthorized use of your property. The only way you can foul up is if you cannot prove the veracity of the facts stated in the Invoice — which is a notarized affidavit, the most powerful private/legal/commercial instrument in the world. You cannot afford to make a false attestation, nor bear false wi tness (perjury), so be sure you can legally prove what is stated in your Invoice/affidavit. Each invoice has attached only a copy of the documentary evidence used in calculating the total amount due (original Invoices are retained for future filing; origi nals of documentary evidence are retained permanently by you). (d) Give your debtor ten (10) days from date Invoice is sent to tender payment in full. There is no rush on this; the days will fly by. (e) Make as many originals of each notarized Invoice as you will need for each separate filing to be done both at state and county level (each piece of real estates needs its own filing, and only originals of affidavits are accepted). 3. Send the Invoice . After notarizing, make a photocopy of the original Invoic e and attached proof of use of your property, as well as any page attached by the notary. Debtor gets only a photocopy of the original notarized Invoice and attachments; retain the original Invoice for later use . Send a photocopy of the Invoice (plus att achments) by Registered Mail, Affidavit of Mailing, as described above in paragraph IV. F, “Registered Mail envelope and mailing.” 4. Get familiarized with default provisions . Be sure you understand the default provisions in the Notice by Written Communi cation. Defaults are inevitable, and debtor will be in default 10 days after Invoice is sent , not 10 days after debtor receives it. Per UCC, it is debtor’s responsibility to monitor receipt of mail and make sure all financial obligations are met. Before the 10 - day period expires, you may contact UCC Services Group and let them know you are approaching the time to initiate foreclosure proceedings, described below in paragraph D . 5. Begin generating the “Affidavit of Debt” . The Affidavit of Debt is the sworn document that empowers you to foreclose non - judicially on the debtor (“strict foreclosure”) and also indemnifies all others (such as the sheriff and judge and clerk of court) who assist you (as plaintiff) in enforcing the private consensual contract that was voluntarily executed, defaulted upon, and then ignored by the debtor. 16 The Affidavit    16 As mentioned earlier, the affidavit is the most powerful legal/commercial document in the world. Big Brother’s operatives, especially esquires, steer clear of the use of affidavits because such use entails personal liability and accountability based on statements that are sworn “true, correct, and complete” — a notion that strikes terror in the heart of virtually all government officials. Were such operatives forthright in intent and action they would have no difficulty in swearing out an affidavit, but this is not the case. Big Brother’s agents mount their assaults based on inferior, judicial “declarations,” sworn “true and correct,” and based on “information and belief” (limited - liability,"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"Handling Presentments – Instructions Page 18 of 21 Rev. Oct. 2002 of Debt is a precise recital of all events in the course of the debtor’s initiation and execution of the consensual contract and subsequent failure to meet the f inancial obligations associated therewith. “Contract makes the law” (ancient and universal maxim of law) —and when you know the law (terms of the contract) you can enforce it (default and strict -foreclosure provisions) with impunity based on certainty of t he correctness of your position, affirmed by affidavit. If the need for (deadly) force enters in, it is best to enlist the help of the courts and the sheriff. Begin generating your own, customized Affidavit of Debt as soon as possible by using the instru ctions and sample documents provided in Section XIII, “Supplemental Instructional Material for Handling Presentments,” beginning on page 391. C. Non -judicial strict foreclosure and collection . This is an extremely serious undertaking, however simple the final execution may end up being, and must be approached with the utmost respect for procedure. This is the step that reverses the statist, 17 totalitarian, communistic, property -confiscation machinery developed and institutionalized by the Legal Masters of the World over the last 2,000+ years, and they are not pleased with our progress. For these and other reasons, it is not recommended that anyone attempt this process on a first -time basis without help from someone who has already successfully done it. It is not enough just to be “right”; you must be perfectly right to avoid retaliation from Big Brother. Legal experts in the UCC and Revised Article 9 have written entire books on just this subject to guide their fellow esquire -mercenaries because it is so significant and so easily misunderstood. Even some judges do not understand the default provisions contained in Revised Article 9. Believe it or not, the strict -foreclosure procedure discussed in this book is the same procedure that is undertaken thousa nds of times every single day by mortgage companies and banks who request the help of a Federal -Reserve -Note tribunal (court) in authorizing the use of deadly violence (sheriff) to evict those parties who have failed to meet their alleged private, contract ual, financial obligations and have also failed to adhere to the agreement to vacate the premises in such case. There is no reason that you cannot access the same procedure, including even using an attorney to request a hearing and getting the judge to is sue an order authorizing the sheriff to use as much force as necessary to get someone to comply with the private, Federal -Reserve -Note contract. UCC Services Group has been instituted to help in such matters, so as soon as you know when you will be ready to proceed with strict foreclosure, it is time to make contact. VII. Protecting Oneself in Pressure Situations and Criminal Proceedings . A. Speaking and acting on your own behalf .

A public officer whose function is to attest and certify, by his hand and official seal, certain classes of documents, in order to give them credit and authenticity in foreign jurisdictions ; to take acknowledgments of deeds and other conveyances, and certify the same; and to perform certain official acts, chiefly in commerci al matters, such as the protesting of notes and bills, the noting of foreign drafts, and marine protests in cases of loss or damage.

Notary’s “Certification of Non - Response ”. A notary is an “officer of the state” and, as such, a notary’s word ca rries great weight. When the notary attests that no correspondence was received from any of the agents and principals that have charged (dual criminal/financial significance) you for an alleged crime, a common - law judgment of non pros is obtained. Agents and principals can avoid the $500,000.00 name - use fee by using the term “Secured Party” instead of the sender’s True Name © /TRADE NAME © for addressing correspondence; but nearly all reject this option. The notary confirms non - receipt of correspondence wit h a simple form called “Certification of Non - Response,” a sample of which appears in Appendix under Notary’s “Certification of Non - Response”. You draw up the form, listing each party that you want the notary to acknowledge as not having heard from, and br ing it to the notary for his/her seal and signature. 3. Enlisting the help of a notary . Ideally, you will have a notary public among your friends, family, and associates. 18 If not, if is a simple matter to enlist the help of a notary for a Certification of Non - Response. (a) Speaking with the notary . In a friendly fashion, let the notary know that: (i) You are handling a matter in which you need outside, third - party verification that your requests for a written response from certain people are being ign ored; (ii) His/her word as a notary would remove all doubt in the matter; and (iii) You would just drop by in a couple of weeks with a short list of people to see if the notary had received any correspondence from any of them — and pick up any such correspo ndence that had arrived; and (iv) For those who had not sent anything, you would be happy to pay “[you choose a number]” dollars [a realistic and agreeable fee] for a simple, one - sentence acknowledgment that nothing had come in from the parties the notary had not heard from.   18 Becoming a notary is a very simple matter, usually taking only one day’s training, the primary qualification for which is “resid ence.” Residence is a nasty term ( see Glossary ), but fortunately concerns only straw - man TRADE NAMES. Examine the seal of any notary: all text is set in English except for the notary’s TRADE NAME, which is set in capitals (start looking more closely at a ll documents; Big Brother knows exactly what it is doing)."},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"Handling Presentments – Instructions Page 21 of 21 Rev. O c t . 2002 (b) After securing notary’s Certification of Non - Response . Serve each agent and principal in the same fashion the original affidavit was served. You now have profound evidence on the record that nobody ever had any right to use your common - law - copyrighted property without your authorization, and that no such authorization was ever given. Besides the financial charges for use of your property, the attackers are in no - man’s land, “up the creek without a paddle,” because there is no leg al foundation/basis for their attack. B.

See “Helpful Notes for Pressure Situations” on page 322 in this Section for ideas on how to avoid dealing with Big Brother altogether, a nd how to cope with its operatives in unavoidable situations. C. Doing business with any and all who use your private property . Upon receipt of any presentment bearing your common - law - copyrighted property, for both civil and criminal matters, immediately serve each and every involved party proceeding against you (including judges, clerks of court, prosecutors, attorneys, and others) with his/her own, personal Notice by Written Communication. Use “Difficult opt - out procedure (with subsequent “Self - executin g” paragraph)” text described under paragraph “II.4(b)” of these instructions, and send by Registered Mail. You can also send one to the presiding/chief judge of a particular courthouse and thereby place the entire courthouse on notice. Those who do no t surrender all originals and copies containing your private property (in any form of recorded media) into your possession within the 72 - hour Truth - in - Lending - Act period, thereby execute the consensual contract. Immediately file a UCC Financing Statement against all such parties both at state level and, after obtaining a legal description of all their real estate holdings, at county level. Each piece of real estate needs its own separate financing statement (you can only file against one property in a sin gle real estate filing at county level). Draw up an invoice for each party and bill them by Registered Mail (send a copy of the notarized original invoice; retain the original), based on the number of uses of your copyrighted property multiplied by $500,0 00.00.

"},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"Supplemental Instr uctional Material Page 1 of 4 Supplemental Instructional Material for Handling Presentments I. The Affidavit of Debt . A. Introduction . The Affidavit of Debt is your sworn statement concerning all events that have transpired and brought about the indebtedness, and stands as the truth in commerce unless rebutted by the debtor point - for - point by counteraffidavit sworn true, correct, and complete. Because of the inherently fraudulent nature of the legal, financial, and taxation systems, actors within these arenas must remain in the shado ws in order to continue their duplicitous practices and avoid general detection. Accordingly, it is highly unlikely that the Affidavit of Debt will ever be rebutted — because to do so would require a sworn statement that cannot be supported by fact. The UC C filing office requires that an original (not a copy) of the Affidavit of Debt accompany any UCC Financing Statement, so there may be a need for multiple original Affidavits of Debt. Debtor does not get a copy of the Affidavit of Debt; it is strictly for filing with a financing statement in the UCC filing office. B. Generating the Affidavit of Debt . Begin creating your own personal, customized Affidavit of Debt against your debtor by following the sample Affidavit of Debt provided in this section foll owing these supplemental instructions and plugging in your particulars for those of John Henry Doe’s. (1) Attachments . Generally, filing offices require the debtor’s military - style name (LAST, FIRST, MIDDLE) and address to appear in the uppermost, left - hand corner of all attachment pages in the same format as the financing statement ( see page 287 for an example). Although this is not strictly enforced, it is still recommended that you place the debtor’s name and address in this style on any attachment w henever possible. The notarized Affidavit of Debt is most effective when it has the following attachments: (a) Copy of either the five - page, stand - alone Notice by Written Communication/ Security Agreement, or the Notice by Written Communication/Security Agree ment contained within the 14 - page Validation of Debt Package ( attach the complete document, all 14 pages ), along with the following: (i) Copy of the presentment/written communication containing debtor’s initial unauthorized use of your common - law - copyright ed property (that prompted this entire cycle to be undertaken by you); (ii) Copy of the newspaper Affidavit of Publishing re your Copyright Notice; (iii) Copy of your certified UCC Financing Statement; (iv) Copy of the Affidavit of Mailing for whichever versio n of the Notice by Written Communication/Security Agreement you used;"},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"Supplemental Instr uctional Material Page 2 of 4 (v) Copy of USPS “Green Card” (PS Form 3811), proving debtor’s receipt of whichever version of the Notice by Written Communication/Security Agreement you used; (b) Original, notarized Invoice , a photocopy of which was sent debtor demanding payment, along with the following attached documents: (i) Copy of all proof of unauthorized use of your common - law - copyrighted property that was sent debtor as an attachment with the Invoice; (ii) Copy of the Affidavit of Mailing for Invoice; (iii) Copy of USPS “Green Card” (PS Form 3811), proving debtor’s receipt of Invoice; (2) Non - attachments . Please note that your personal Private Agreement, Hold - harmless and Indemnity Agreement, and Security Agreement a re private documents and do not get filed as attachments with the Affidavit of Debt in the filing process — even though the debtor was sent a copy of each in your initial mailing . These three documents are not needed to prove the indebtedness of the debtor and are withheld from filing in the public record for privacy reasons. II. Filing a UCC Financing Statement Against Presenter/Debt Collector . A. Public notice of a private contract . Until a financing statement is filed against the debtor, no one else knows about your private, consensual contract with said debtor. A filed financing statement is general public notice of the debtor’s indebtedness and the collateral pledged as security for the obligation; a sworn Affidavit of Debt attached thereto is deta iled public notice of the debtor’s illicit attempts at using your common - law - copyrighted property for commercial gain without authorization, and the subsequent debt incurred thereby. Sworn statements (testimony, evidence) placed in the public record cannot be summarily invalidated and brushed aside by anyone. B. When to file . The financing statement should be filed in as soon as possible as of the eleventh (11 th ) day from the date of mailing of the Invoice (Note: the 10 - day clock starts ticking when the Invoice is mailed ; not when it is received by the debtor — debtor is responsible for monitoring his mail traffic after incurring the obligation). C. Where to file . For purposes of filing correctly, you must determine presenter’s/debt collector’s locatio n (“residence”) in accordance with UCC 9 - 307 ( see paragraph “IV.A” on page 225 for an explanation). Note: corporate debtors have different criteria than those for individuals). Financing statements should be filed as follows: (1) At state level in the UCC filing office of the state where the debtor maintains residence; and (2) At county level in any county in any state where debtor has real estate holdings registered in debtor’s name. Each piece of real estate requires its own, separate, UCC Financing Statement, with an original Affidavit of Debt and an original Invoice (as explained above) in order to be accepted for filing."},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"Supplemental Instr uctional Material Page 3 of 4 D. Completing the form . The financing statement is virtually the same for filing at both state and county level. However, ple ase take note of the following points: (1) Box 4, Collateral Description . (a) Box 4 text . No matter which version of the Notice by Written Communication/ Security Agreement you used, the collateral description in Box 4 is the same: “All of debtor's ass ets, land, and personal property, and all of debtor's rights in said assets, land, and personal property, now owned and hereafter acquired, now existing and hereafter arising, and wherever located, described fully in security agreement entitled “NOTICE BY WRITTEN COMMUNICATION / SECURITY AGREEMENT” dated [Date of the particular Notice By Written Communication/Security Agreement that you used] , by and between debtor and secured party, to secure debtor’s obligation in favor of secured party in the sum certain amount of [Dollar amount of indebtedness] .

Secured party accepts debtor's signature in accord with UCC §§ 1 - 201(39), 3 - 401. (b) Security Agreement .

(2) Box 6 . For all real estate filings at county level, check Box 6, “Real Estate Records.” Do not check this box for filings at state level. (3) Box 13 . Place an “ X ” in the last check - box in Box 13, “fixture filing,” for b oth state - and county - level filings. (4) Box 14, county filings only . If you are doing a real estate filing at county level, place the legal description of the property in Box 14. Leave this box blank for state - level filings. (5) Box 18 . There is no ass ertion that the debtor is a transmitting utility. This is not a transmitting - utility filing, so do not make a mark in Box 18. (E) Assembling the package . Place the appropriate two - page UCC Financing Statement on top of each completed original Affidavit of Debt — with all its attachments — and make at least one copy of each entire stack.

This reality is spelled out in detail in your security agreement and is echoed in the UCC Financing Statement filed with the secretary of state — but you must also obtain the bank’s acknowledgement of this fact. Once do cumented on the bank signature card as an authorized representative on the account, control of the collateral (the funds in the account) is established, thus perfecting your security interest in the account. At that point, your other relationship with the account holder/debtor, i.e. that of secured party, can be impressed upon bank personnel — and such are obligated to honor the perfected security interest — thus securing account funds from third - party levy. Pertinent Sections of the Uniform Commercial Code Here are the sections of the Uniform Commercial Code governing such matters: § 9 - 314. Perfection by Control. (a) Perfection by control. A security interest in...deposit accounts...may be perfected by control of the collateral under Section 9 - 104...” § 9 - 104. Control of Deposit Account. (a) Requirements for control. A secured party has control of a deposit account if: ...(2) the debtor, secured party, and bank have agreed in an authenticated record that the bank will comply with instructions originated by the secured party directing disposition of the funds in the deposit account without further consent by the debtor...” The signature card (property of the bank), signed by both account holder (debtor) and authorized representative (secured party), constitu tes an agreed - upon, authenticated record “that the bank will comply with instructions originated by the secured party [ authorized representative ] directing disposition of the funds in the deposit account without further consent by the debtor [ account holde r ].” Signing the Signature Card With one exception, the bank signature card should be signed exactly as shown in “How to Sign Your Signature Without Liability” on page 315 of Cracking the Code Third Edition © , “CTC3,” with signature of both debtor and se cured party appearing. Signing in this manner differentiates between the contracting parties, i.e. True Name and TRADE NAME, corresponds with the documentation you provide, and satisfies the requirement of UCC 9 - 104(a)(2). Select from the sample signatur es appearing on page 319 of CTC3 that contain both debtor’s and secured party’s signature, but do not place a copyright symbol, i.e. “©,” after either of the two names. The copyright symbol, and likewise the copyright notice, is not used here. It is more important to establish the account and be acknowledged as the authorized representative than it is to assert the copyright — which can always be called into play later if necessary, but this is not likely.    1 Levy: n. A seizure. v. To raise; execute; exact; collect; gather; take up; seize. Thus, to levy (raise or collect) a tax."},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":" How to Secure a Bank Account from Levy 2 For an existing account, a request to examine th e signature card for the account will usually be granted, but bank personnel may not be too delighted with your new self - proclaimed status as authorized representative/agent and the accompanying artwork you render on the card to prove your point. If you a re able to modify the signature card on your account without causing any friction, by all means do so. However, if this is not feasible, the easiest thing to do is simply to close the account and open another. Opening a new a bank account is a simple mat ter, and there is nothing wrong with using the same bank as long as no undue antagonism is generated in the process. The most hygienic method, however, is to open your new account with another bank and start afresh. Documenting Your Position At the time y ou sign the bank signature card you should have with you a certified copy of both your UCC Financing Statement and the security agreement referenced within the text of the collateral description of the financing statement (use the “Copy Certification by Do cument Custodian” form to make a certified copy of the security agreement). These certified copies are to be left with the bank after the signature card is completed. Upon signing the signature card, inform the bank personnel assisting you that the accou nt holder is also your debtor and that you are the secured party, and then produce the certified copy of your financing statement and security agreement. The identifying number of the security agreement appearing within the collateral - description box (Box 4 on a UCC Financing Statement; Box 8 on a UCC Financing Statement AMENDMENT in the case of a cross - filing) of the financing statement and the section entitled “Authorized Representative” on page 7 of the security agreement (page 247 of CTC3) should be hi ghlighted for ease of inspection. Bank personnel are only too familiar with such kinds of documents, so there should be no difficulty in understanding what you are presenting. As long as bank personnel can see that you know what you are doing, there will be no problem. Guaranteeing Success It is vital that you thoroughly understand that you are not the account holder — and can never be the account holder. The name of all account holders appears in all - capital letters in all bank records and documents. Al l account holders are artificial persons, e.g. your TRADE NAME. This policy is purely of the bank’s own choosing; all you are doing is respecting the bank’s selection/designation of the account holder. If bank personnel balk at all, have the girl/guy pul l out a sample personal check from her/his drawer and point out the name of the account holder printed on the check. The name is set in capital letters. If the secretary of state recognizes the distinction between the two names on your financing statemen t, it is reasonable to expect that the “New Accounts” officer will too. In the event there is further resistance, have her/him examine what appears to be the signature line on the sample personal check using the magnifying glass that you produce (bring on e with you, if possible). Even though the check is a personal check, and therefore theoretically would have only one signatory, said “line” is for any authorized signatory of the account holder — i.e. an authorized representative — and you are such an authori zed signatory/representative. "},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":" How to Secure a Bank Account from Levy 3 These facts should quell any doubts on the part of bank personnel. However, as always, the senior factor is your personal certainty of what you are doing. The Federal Reserve literally owns the U.S. Government, and covertl y asserts ownership of all property in America by claiming that the State — i.e. its bankrupt slave — owns everything. 2 This absurdity is enforced based on the justification that Federal Reserve Notes (private property of the Fed) were used as the “valuable c onsideration” in the acquisition said property. Banks (Fed instrumentalities) do business only with artificial persons whose names appear in all - capital letters; any party that “volunteers” to act as a surety and give anomalous indorsements and sign as an accommodation party 3 for the account holder, however, is never turned away. It is also wise to familiarize yourself with the section of the security agreement entitled “Event of Default,” which can also be highlighted if desired. This paragraph appears just below “Authorized Representative” at the bottom of page 7 of the security agreement. Any attempt by any third party to remove any of the debtor - account holder’s funds (your secured collateral) constitutes an event of default on the part of the debtor and allows you to foreclose on the collateral, i.e. withdraw the funds if necessary. Because you provide the bank with certified documentary evidence of your secured - party status at the time the signature card is signed, no other party can have a prior s ecurity interest in those funds, and all bank personnel must acknowledge this fact and honor your perfected security interest or risk both civil and criminal charges. As a final note on securing your position, a certified copy of your UCC Financing Statem ent and security agreement left with bank personnel could conceivably be misplaced/lost, although this is unlikely based on the potential liability attendant with such oversight. However, it is nevertheless a good idea to send the manager of the bank an a dditional certified copy of both financing statement and security agreement by Registered Mail (Restricted Delivery), with an Affidavit of Mailing. A cover letter confirming your perfected security interest in the collateral in the account and the bank’s responsibility in protecting this secured collateral should also be enclosed. As long as you can prove that the manager received the above cover letter and the certified copies of the documents (evidence), the bank is liable for any pilferage of the accou nt.    2 Senate Document No. 43, 73 rd Congress, 1 st Session.

If the reader is in need of legal advice the reader is advised to contact a legal professional authorized to dispense s uch. The information contained herein is not provided to assist anyone to evade taxes. Rather, it is offered to enlighten those who may be unaware that application for, and use of, a Social Security Account Number is — per the Social Security Administration — strictly voluntary; to remind the reader that voluntary compliance (re the payment of income tax) is expected of those who decide to enroll/participate in the income tax system; to reveal the mechanics of exactly how one volunteers to take part in either of these two programs; and to offer another lawful alternative for those who may no longer wish to continue to volunteer. Social Security Account Numbers The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) personal income tax scheme is utterly dependent upo n the continued submission of Social Security Account Numbers (SSAN’s) collected from new employees by employers. New employees routinely provide a SSAN on a signed IRS Form W - 4 Employee’s Withholding Allowance Certificate when requested by an employer, a nd the employer dutifully forwards the W - 4’s in accordance with IRS wishes. Without such unparalleled largesse 1 (SSAN’s volunteered by new employees and then submitted by employers), IRS has no lawful basis for the assessment and collection of Social Secu rity payroll tax from said new employees — and likewise for every other kind of tax routinely levied 2 from a paycheck. Most people think that they have no choice, i.e. that they must provide a SSAN when asked for one by their new employer if they want to hav e a job. This is not true for a number of reasons, but possibly the most significant one is the official stance of the issuer of all SSAN’s, the Social Security Administration (SSA). The following excerpts are taken directly from the official SSA web sit e at www.ssa.gov ; specifically: “Questions?” then “Social Security Number & Card” then Page 2, Question #23: “ When do I have to provide my Social Security Number? ” The following passages (as well as others) appear: “ Que stion: “ Must I provide a Social Security number (SSN) to any business or government agency that asks? “ Answer: ” “If a business or other enterprise 3 asks you for your SSN, you can refuse to give it.” “Giving your number is voluntary, even when you are asked for the number directly.” “The decision is yours.” The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) requires only that an employer request a SSAN from each new employee, and can levy a fine if the employer fails to obtain/ask for a SSAN. However, IRC also provid es for a waiver of such penalty if the employer fulfills the request requirement but fails to obtain a SSAN because the new employee declines to provide one (no willful neglect on the part of the employer). If there is ultimately no penalty/fine if the em ployer fails to obtain a SSAN from a new employee, there is no requirement that a new employee provide one in the first place. No penalty = Not required.    1 Largesse: Liberal or generous giving; a large gift or donation. 2 Levy: v. To raise; execute; exact; collect; gather; take up; seize.

For documentary evidence proving this fact see Internal Revenue Service in Glossary of Cracking the Code Third Edition , available at www.bbcoa.com ."},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":" How to Get Paid All of Your Earnings 2 Similarly, IRC contains no provision for the assessment and collection of income tax from a new em ployee for whom it has no SSAN. Accordingly, IRC contains no provision that allows/requires/instructs an employer to refuse to continue to employ the new employee, to fire the new employee, to refuse to pay the new employee his/her earnings, to withhold a portion of the new employee’s earnings, or permit any other such unlawful measures. Employees who do not provide a SSAN (on a signed W - 4, the only authorized way in IRC) when requested to do so are simply not eligible for any benefits (Social Security an d other) associated with the earnings they collect from that particular employer. Any retaliatory action taken against the new employee by the employer, such as any of the ones listed above, is unlawful and can be immediately vindicated via lawsuit — and the new employee will win. This is why: The new employee is hired first and then only subsequently asked to provide a SSAN (on a signed W - 4). At the time this is requested of the new employee, he/she is already employed . This fact is echoed in the prescrip tions of IRC, in that IRC authorizes requesting a SSAN only of an employee . Since providing a SSAN on a signed W - 4 is voluntary (the only valid signature is one that is signed freely), the employer cannot lawfully coerce the new employee into doing what i s otherwise a voluntary act. The matter of providing a SSAN (on a signed W - 4) is strictly between employee and employer, and does not involve any outside third party, such as IRS and SSA: “... We do not have the authority to require an employer to provide o r deny employment or services to anyone who refuses to disclose his or her number. This is a matter between the individual and the employer .” Dorcas R. Hardy Commissioner of Social Security Letter of response to Rodney Rickman, July 16, 1986 “... There is no law prohibiting a person from exercising his right to work without possessing a Social Security number....” Harry Reid United States Senator (Nevada) Response letter to Kevin Passow, April 24, 1990 The Nature of Benefi ts Though not as straightforward in the matter of a government agency asking for a SSAN, the same official SSA web site does not contain one single passage that unequivocally states that anyone is ever required to provide any government agency with a SSAN upon request. The text of SSA web site, created by the same word - wizards that write IRC and every other Code in existence, is masterfully cloaked in ambiguity in order to cause the reader only to believe it is mandatory to provide a SSAN when requested b y a government agency 4 — but since the only conscionable 5 purpose behind use of a SSAN is the acquisition of a benefit, no one can ever be compelled to provide one. An ancient and timeless maxim of law states, “No one can be compelled to accept a benefit ag ainst his will,” and so it is with SSAN’s. The official SSA web site fully acknowledges this fact as shown above. Accordingly, no one is ever required to provide a SSAN under any circumstances unless, of course, someone is desirous of a Social Security - r elated benefit and the account number is necessary to verify eligibility.    4 The only time a SSAN is required is upon application for a benefit. 5 Conscionable: Conformable to conscience or to right or duty; just: most common in the negative; as your demands are not conscionable ."},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":" How to Get Paid All of Your Earnings 3 Employer Leeway in Obtaining a SSAN from an Employee No matter what an employer believes an employee’s responsibilities may be in the matter of providing a SSAN, the employer is not authorized by IRC, nor by any other Code, to take any action against the employee in an effort to induce the employee to provide a SSAN and seek a benefit against the employee’s will, once the employer requests a SSAN and the employee declines to provi de one. Neither United States Code (USC) nor Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) provides any instruction for any further communication with the employee on the subject of SSAN’s once the request is made, and likewise for any retaliatory action against the employee for refusing to provide one. Whatever the employer does in such case is based only upon the employer’s unfounded belief of what the employer is authorized/”supposed” to do, combined with ignorance of the law — and as we all know from Big Brother’s cheerleaders : “Ignorance of the law is no excuse.” Similarly, no employer is authorized by any Code to abrogate 6 the terms and conditions of the employment contract with the employee. Again, the employment contract is executed first ; only afterwards do es the employer request a SSAN and try to induce the employee to seek Social Security benefits and enter into a separate contract with a third party (IRS). Whenever two parties go into contract with each other (whether verbally or in writing), common sens e (as well as contract law) tells us that neither party can subsequently introduce new, arbitrary terms and conditions that must be fulfilled by the other party before the instigating party will honor its obligations as agreed upon in the contract (a form of “breach of contract”). When a contracting party claims the existence of a law that mandates such perfidious 7 conduct, that party is talking through his hat, as the Constitution expressly forbids the enactment (i.e. existence ) of any such law: “ No Stat e shall...pass any...Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts ...” Constitution of the United States (of America) Article I, Section 10, Clause 6 No One Required to Seek Benefits Even in those cases where a SSAN is required in order to receive a benefit , such as for unemployment compensation, welfare, and food stamps, the decision to apply for any such benefit and provide a SSAN (method by which a sovereign forfeits his/her sovereignty and cements his/her subjugation) is always voluntary . It cannot be a ny other way, because there is neither a penalty for failure to initiate a request for a benefit, nor a penalty for failure to follow through and acquire any such benefit. No penalty = Not required. As an employee, the only official way to seek eligibil ity for Social Security benefits in respect of earnings with a particular employer is to provide that employer with a SSAN — on a signed IRS Form W - 4 . No other way is authorized in IRC. Therefore, if one does not wish to be eligible for Social Security ben efits based on one’s earnings with a particular employer, one would not submit the SSAN on the prescribed form, i.e. a W - 4. To decline eligibility for Social Security benefits based on one’s earnings apparently is a very commonplace event because the whol e of the matter is taken up and concluded in a single sentence in IRC with a simple mandate for the employer: sign an affidavit stating you requested a SSAN, but the employee did not give you one. Per IRC, no further action by the employer is authorized.    6 Abrogate: To annul by authoritative act; abolish; repeal; as, to abrogate a rule or custom. 7 Perfidious: [< F. perfidie , < L. perfidia , < per, from, + fides, faith.] Characterized by perfidy; involving a breach of faith; contrary to loyal ty and truth; as perfidious actions."},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":" How to Get Paid All of Your Earnings 4 “Voluntary Compliance” IRS officials and media pundits harp incessantly about “voluntary compliance” with income tax — and rightfully so : People who voluntarily acquire a SSAN (even via a parent) and then voluntarily sign a statement (W - 4) swearing that they are a “taxpayer” and liable for the “income” tax, and listing a SSAN, voluntarily obligate themselves for income tax on earnings they make with the employer that collects the sworn statement (W - 4). Such people should, therefore, voluntarily comply w ith IRC mandates re the payment of income tax on earnings with that employer. Employees for whom an employer has no SSAN on a signed W - 4 would, of course, have no such obligation re their earnings with that employer: “ A person with no social security [sic] number would have no taxable income .” Penny Payton, Claims Representative Department of Health & Human Services Response letter to Jerome T. Schiefen, January 10, 1990 For all intents and purposes, there is no substantial difference between an emplo yee with no SSAN (as suggested in the above quote) and an employee who declines to provide a SSAN when requested of him/her. Once IRS receives a SSAN on a signed W - 4 (collected and sent in by an employer), however, IRS converts the SSAN into a “taxpayer i dentification number” (without authorization) and then the charade of providing for all the employee’s purported future Social Security - related benefits commences and IRS begins expropriating whatever funds it wants from the paycheck today. The SSAN — the foundation and indispensable component of the income tax scheme — is acquired voluntarily and provided voluntarily (even in the case of government agencies) every step of the way for the purpose of participating in the advertised aims of Social Security, i.e . so - called “retirement benefits.” Making provision to realize said future retirement benefits by signing a W - 4 today is a sovereign, self - determined, voluntary act that can be conscionably undertaken only for the purpose of acquiring a benefit (there can be no other reason). If no benefits are desired, no such action need be taken. When no SSAN is volunteered via the W - 4, there is no Social Security payroll tax — and no other kind of tax associated with the earnings received from that employer. The reaso n one is asked — and not ordered — to do these things is because it is unlawful to force someone to do something against his/her will. The only way to become eligible for Social Security benefits is to acquire a SSAN and voluntarily go into contract with IRS by providing a SSAN on a signed IRS Form W - 4. No one can be penalized for not seeking Social Security benefits. Nuts - and - Bolts Proof: Federal Codes The above arguments are not mere speculation, and are confirmed in entirety in United States Code (USC) an d Code of Federal Regulations (CFR): An employer must request a SSAN from a new employee: “ Any person required under the authority of this title to make a return, statement or other document with respect to another person shall request from such other pers on, and shall include in any return, statement, or other document, such identifying number as may be prescribed for securing proper identification of such other person .” 26 8 USC 6109(a)(3) ( Bold emphasis added)    8 Title 26 of United States Code = Internal Revenue Code."},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":" How to Get Paid All of Your Earnings 5 Regulation (positive law) interpretin g the above 26 USC 6109(a)(3) prescribes procedure for an employer that does not know a new employee’s SSAN even after having requested such: “ If the person making the return, statement, or other document does not know the taxpayer identifying number of t he other person...such person must request the other person’s number. The request should state that the identifying number is required to be furnished under authority of law. When the person making the return, statement, or other document does not know the number of the other person , and has complied with the request provision of this paragraph (c) , such person must sign an affidavit on the transmittal document forwarding such returns, statements, or other documents to the Internal Revenue Service so stating . A person required to file a taxpayer identifying number shall correct any errors m such filing when such person's attention has been drawn to them .” 26 CFR 301.6109 - 1(c) ( Bold emphasis added) Penalty for an employer’s failure to obtain a SSAN fro m a new employee: “ In the case of a failure by any person to comply with a specified information reporting requirement on or before the time prescribed therefor, such person shall pay a penalty of $50 for each such failure ...” 26 USC 6723 ( Bold emphasis a dded) Waiver of penalty for failure to obtain a SSAN if employee refuses to provide a SSAN (purpose of the affidavit provision in 26 CFR 301.6109 - 1(c) above): “ No penalty shall be imposed under this part with respect to any failure if it is shown that suc h failure is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect .” 26 USC 6724(a) ( Bold emphasis added) It is very simple: An employer is required request a SSAN from a new employee (on a W - 4, the only authorized way). If the new employee refuses t o provide a SSAN, the employer is required by regulation (positive law) to submit an affidavit attesting that the request was made, thus eliminating the possibility of willful neglect on the part of the employer and ensuring a waiver of the $50 penalty the employer would have incurred without it. What is the new employee’s role in all this? The new employee plays almost no part in this process. The new employee has no contact and no relationship with IRS, only the employer, who merely requests a SSAN. O nce the new employee declines to provide same, his/her role in the process is complete. At that point the employer has no other lawful option than to send IRS an affidavit (as prescribed by law) and honor the employment contract with the employee. IRS is satisfied, the new employee is satisfied, and therefore the employer should be satisfied. Employer = IRS Slave The reason the current income tax scheme is so effective is that IRS enlists an outside, third - party volunteer, the employer , to work withou t pay — i.e. as an unwitting slave — to ensure that people who draw a paycheck from said employer pay Social Security payroll tax (and income tax, by virtue of submitting the SSAN on an IRS Form W - 4). Everything the employer does in this wise is voluntary . I RS assumes no liability for the actions of the employer re removal of funds from the employee’s paycheck, nor does IRS compensate the employer for his/her/its labor. Since the employer already erroneously believes that it is his/her/its duty to calculate, collect (levy), and distribute taxes from employees’ earnings without compensation, it is easy to imagine the difficulties that one might encounter in educating the employer re the actual facts of the law. Therefore, it is imperative that one be as prepa red as possible to deal with any eventuality that might arise at the moment of truth."},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":" How to Get Paid All of Your Earnings 6 Two Different Situations People who draw a paycheck for their living fit into one of two categories: (1) currently employed, (2) currently unemployed. Folks in th e latter category will have an easier time of things when they start their next job because the employer will not know their SSAN. People currently employed who want their employer to change horses in midstream and “forget” their SSAN and signed W - 4 may h ave a little more work ahead of them. In such case, moving on and looking for a new job may be more appealing than sticking with a current employer who refuses to mend his/her/its ways, comply with the law, and do the right thing — despite the apparent disa dvantages that come with seeking new work. We shall deal with both of these situations, the simpler of the two first: new employers. A Most Critical Decision The reader that decides to continue to participate in the Social Security retirement program in o rder to be eligible for Social Security and other types of benefits derived from his/her earnings via employment will have no use for the remainder of this essay. However, the information that follows immediately below is nevertheless offered so those who are undecided are better equipped to make an informed decision. The Nature of Social Security The Social Security retirement benefits program fits the definition of a Ponzi scheme 9 and therefore should be carefully considered by those who intend to partak e in it: “Ponzi scheme. ( pon - zee). A fraudulent investment scheme in which money contributed by later investors generates artificially high dividends for the original investors, whose example attracts even larger investments. • Money from the new inves tors is used directly to repay or pay interest to old investors, usu. without any operation or revenue - producing activity other than the continual raising of new funds. This scheme takes from Charles Ponzi, who in the late 1920’s was convicted for fraudul ent schemes he conducted in Boston.” Black’s Law Dictionary , Seventh Edition (1999) Social Security is the most massive Ponzi scheme in the history of the world, siphoning off literally tens of trillions of Social Security - payroll - tax dollars from unwi tting “volunteers” since 1935. Presently, only people born before 1940 (“old investors”) can expect to receive a full payout of Social Security benefits for the duration of their life after they retire. Most others (“new investors”) can only hope for par tial benefits, and people born after 1970 have no hope of ever receiving any Social Security benefits in their lifetime. White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer confirms Social Security’s nature as a Ponzi scheme in the Thursday, July 25, 2002 edition o f the Los Angeles Times in an article entitled “White House Says Bush Still Backs Benefit Plan”: “ White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer took a swing at the existing Social Security program, calling it ‘dangerous’ to ‘let people pay a lifetime of high taxes for a Social Security benefit that under current projections they’ll never receive .’” Those who do not wish to continue to take part in Social Security are invited to continue on with the addendum attached hereto; others may stop at this point.    9 Ponzi schemes are illegal and victims of a Ponzi scheme usually never see a return of their investment. For a comprehensive examination and exposé of the Soci al Security System as a Ponzi scheme, see “The Curse of Co - Suretyship,” beginning on page 68 of Cracking the Code Third Edition ."},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":" How to Get Paid All of Your Earnings 7 How to Get Paid All of Your Earnings Addendum – Instructions I. How to Handle a New Employer if you do not want Social Security Benefits . A. Rule 1 . The very first thing that you need to be aware of is the text of the positive law, i.e. 26 CFR 301.6109 - 1(c), that instructs an employer how to go about obtaining a SSAN from a new employee. Per the text of that section, once the employer “knows” the SSAN of an employee the employer is purportedly compelled to provide IRS with such number — even if the new em ployee withholds consent, disagrees, and forbids any such use of the SSAN. 10 Without placing oneself in a position to have to rectify such a wrong, it is easier simply to avoid the possibility of any such circumstance arising from the beginning. Therefore , the first rule to follow whenever a SSAN is requested of you is: ? Never provide a SSAN unless you want to obtain Social Security benefits. 11 B. Application for employment . It is very likely that the employment application will have a slot for a SSA N. If you do not want Social Security benefits, do not enter your TRADE NAME’S SSAN. [Note: the account holder is your TRADE NAME, not your True Name. Examine the card if you do not believe this.] In the slot on the application for a SSAN, place one of the following: ? “ Not applying for credit ” ? “ Privacy Act ” ? “ Credit check not required ” ? “ Not an employee yet ” ? “ Not applying for SS benefits ” C. How to respond to verbal demands . If employer personnel tell you that they need a number to process your applic ation, any of the following replies can work without generating friction: ? “ I can’t remember it. I’ll have to get it later .” ? “ Do you want to run a credit check for the purpose of issuing credit? If not, a Social Security Account Number has no bearing on a n application for employment.” ? “Unless you are willing to guarantee that I will be hired, I am not willing to provide a Social Security number ahead of time based on privacy concerns.” ? “I’m not applying for Social Security benefits; I’m applying for a job. The issue of Social Security benefits can be taken up later, after I’m hired.”    10 This is an example of how IRS induces the employer to violate/invade one’s privacy, an offense that carries both civil and cr iminal penalties. 11 Although it may be more difficult to follow this rule in opening a bank account, it would also apply equally with banks. The advertised reason that a bank needs a SSAN is for income tax purposes. If the account to be opened were a non - interest bearing account, the need for reporting income (derived from the 1½% annual interest paid) would never arise."},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":" How to Get Paid All of Your Earnings 8 ? “ The Internal Revenue Code does not authorize requesting a Social Security number until I am hired .” ? “ I am afraid of identity theft and prefer to withhold my Social Security Account Number for privacy reasons until it is confirmed that I am hired .” D. One possible exception . In the most extreme cases where the employer insists that is absolutely vital that an applicant’s credit report be checked (even though the official SSA web site says that there are alternative methods to check on someone besides using a SSAN and that businesses “do not need it”) and it seems impossible to get to the next step without revealing it — and you are willing to take the chance in order to get the job — a SSAN might be provided under the following circumstances: Applicant: Okay. I can see that you are sincere, and therefore I am willing to allow my privacy to be compromised just this one time in order to accommodate your needs. However, the applic ation will have to be notated and signed by an company officer that your company will use the number just this one time, and this time only, and for this purpose, and for no other purpose, and that no company employee will retain any record of the number a fter the credit check is complete. As long as you are willing to guarantee those things on behalf of the company on the face of the application, and as long as I can keep the original application and you take a copy, I am willing to allow you the use the Social Security number to run a credit check. Employer: Okay. Never seen anyone that was so concerned about his privacy, though. E. Name and Address of the Job Applicant . The last sentence of 26 CFR 301.6109 - 1(c) is very important and reads as follo ws: “A person required to file a taxpayer identifying number shall correct any errors in such filing when such person's attention has been drawn to them.” 1. IRS databases . What this means is that even though the employee may be successful in starting wo rk without applying for Social Security benefits, and the employer sends IRS an affidavit as instructed, IRS can come back with a SSAN that matches up with the name and address (obtained by the employer from the new employee’s job application) provided in the employer’s affidavit and demand that the employer then correct the errors in “such filing” (that IRS provides the employer) now that the employer’s “attention has been drawn to them” and begin withholding taxes from said new employee’s paycheck. If IR S knows the SSAN, count on them to intimidate the employer into withholding your earnings no matter what you say. 2. Sworn statements . A different name and address that minimizes the possibility of IRS matching up your TRADE NAME’S SSAN from a previous emp loyer is best. Never do anything illegal, such as swear out a false statement (under penalty of perjury, etc.). Any such act weakens your position whether discovered or not and should always be avoided. 3. Variations in the name . There are many ways t hat the name can be lawfully modified/abbreviated; in fact, creditors regularly use corruptions (“derivatives and variations in the spelling”) of the TRADE NAME on legal briefs when they come after an alleged debtor — and the court never has a problem in rul ing against the alleged debtor. Turnabout is fair play. You can utilize this technique for your own advantage."},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":" How to Get Paid All of Your Earnings 9 4. Addresses . Through strictly lawful means, it may be possible to cite an entirely different address than most people think is appropriate fo r your TRADE NAME, both historically and currently. You need to scour the recesses of your mind and get creative; the more creative, the better chance of avoiding being linked up with a SSAN based on an address in an IRS data base. P.O. Boxes, especially those in the name of another party, work well. 12 If one were living in a hotel room as of the date appearing on an employment application, one could arguably cite the address of the hotel on the application, even if it were out - of - town and out - of - state. These are personal choices based on personal conviction and — ideally — could be backed up with documentary evidence if the need ever arose (highly unlikely). F. Taking care of business . Shortly after you are hired, someone instructs you to “Go on down to Pe rsonnel sometime today and sign all the forms,” or some such thing. Follow through and make the visit as instructed and when you are confronted with the “Social Security Benefits Eligibility Form,” i.e. the W - 4, look it over very studiously and then polit ely hand it back. 1. A plausible exchange . Here is a sample conversation that might ensue in such an encounter: New employee: No thanks. I prefer not to seek any Social Security benefits . Personnel Clerk: Oh, but we need that filled out in order to hir e you . New employee: That’s not what I was told by Mr. Smith. Personnel Clerk: What do you mean? New employee: He told me I was hired already . Personnel Clerk: Well, technically that’s true, but IRS requires us to give them a signed W - 4 from every new em ployee . New employee: Are you sure about that? Personnel Clerk: Oh, yes. I’ve been working here for over five years and every employee must give us a competed and signed W - 4 . New employee: Are you saying that what you are asking me to do is governed by th e Internal Revenue Code? Personnel Clerk: Yes. New employee: Well, I believe you are mistaken because the Internal Revenue Code gives explicit instructions on the procedure to follow when a new employee declines to provide a Social Security Account Number and it does not involve trying to persuade the new employee to participate in Social Security. Personnel Clerk: This is getting out of control. I am not here to argue. Either fill out and sign the W - 4 or I will have to recommend that you not be hired. Ne w employee: I’m already hired. Personnel Clerk: Well, then I will have to recommend that you be fired. New employee: On what grounds?   12 Postal employees place mail in the P.O. Box indicated on the envelope, irrespective of the name of the addressee."},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":" How to Get Paid All of Your Earnings 10 Personnel Clerk: On the grounds that you will not do what I am asking you to do. New employee: You are free to do that if you like, but you will be named as an interested party in a lawsuit, along with your company, for wrongful termination and numerous other crimes and violations of the Constitution, and I will win because what I am saying is backed up by the Social Security Administration, the Internal Revenue Code and the Code of Federal Regulations and what you are doing is unlawful, arbitrary, and not supported in law. Would you like to see the law that governs such matters? Personnel Clerk: This conversation is over. P lease wait here. [Leaves the room for a few minutes and returns with Mr. Cooper, the head of the personnel department.] New employee: Hi, Mr. Cooper. Personnel Chief: What seems to be the problem Mr. Doe? New employee: No problem for me. Miss Stewart jus t wanted me to sign up for Social Security benefits and I declined her offer. Personnel Chief: You mean you are unwilling to fill out a W - 4 for our records? New employee: The purpose of a W - 4 is to keep track of Social Security benefits on the money I earn here. Seeking benefits from Social Security is voluntary and I choose not to seek such benefits. Personnel Chief: I am surprised at you, Mr. Doe. You impressed me as a very conscientious fellow, but I am afraid I am going to have to recommend your dismissal. New employee: You mean fire me? Personnel Chief: That’s correct. New employee: What for? Personnel Chief: For being unwilling to follow the law and attempting to work in this country illegally. New employee: So you are saying that in order for me to work in America legally I am compelled to disclose a Social Security number and seek Social Security benefits? Personnel Chief: Yes. New employee: Are you an attorney, Mr. Cooper? Personnel Chief: No. New employee: Did you know that practicing law without a license is illegal and that you just gave me a legal opinion? Do you know that you can go to jail for practicing law without a license? [Silence — because Cooper does not know what he is talking about.] What you just stated is completely outsid e the prescriptions of the Internal Revenue Code and the Code of Federal Regulations regarding an employee that does not provide the employer with a Social Security Account Number. Personnel Chief: I am not going to put up with this nonsense any longer. If you are not willing to fill out a W - 4, you will be fired."},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":" How to Get Paid All of Your Earnings 11 New employee: Very well, but you will be named as an interested party in a lawsuit that will be immediately filed against you and your company, for wrongful termination, denying employment withou t due process, and other crimes and violations of the Constitution, and I will win because what I am saying is backed up by the Internal Revenue Code, the Code of Federal Regulations, and the Social Security Administration and what you are proposing is unl awful, arbitrary, and not supported in law. However, all that unpleasantness can be avoided if you will show me the courtesy of a few minutes of your time to show you the law governing these matters. I have a copy of the applicable sections of the Intern al Revenue Code and the Code of Federal Regulations as well as the official position of the Social Security Administration. We could wrap up this whole conversation in as little as five minutes. Personnel Chief: Are you trying to tell me that the Intern al Revenue Code supports what you are saying? New employee: I am. Would you like to see it? Personnel Chief: [Hesitating] Okay. I am willing to take a look at what you’ve got, but the first instance of any foolishness and this is over. New employee: Fai r enough. First of all, here is what Social Security says I can do when you request a Social Security number from me. This is a printout from the official Social Security Administration web site telling people what to do when a business or other enterpri se asks for their Social Security number. Here is the question [points at the highlighted question] , and here is the answer [points out the highlighted sections at the top of Page 2 of the printout — copy enclosed here]. Personnel Chief: That’s all fine a nd dandy but we are forbidden to allow anyone work here that does not have a SSAN on file. New employee: Is that company policy? Personnel Chief: No. That’s what the IRS requires us to do. New employee: Allow me to show you the Internal Revenue Code and t he implementing regulations of the Code of Federal Regulations that instruct the employer exactly what to do when the employer does not have a Social Security Account Number for the employee. This is section 26 13 USC 6109(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code [shows a printout of the actual code — copy enclosed here]. Notice that the employer is only authorized to “request” a Social Security Account Number. No other action by the employer is authorized by the Code. This is section 26 CFR 301.6109 - 1(c) of the Code of Federal Regulations, which prescribes exactly how the employer is required to implement section 6109(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Irrespective of anything else that may apply in the case of the employee, this is the extent of what the emplo yer is authorized to do. Please read it carefully [personnel chief reads]. Notice that the employer’s only lawful recourse is to sign and submit an affidavit on the transmittal document forwarding returns, statements, and other   13 Title 26 of Un ited States Code = Internal Revenue Code."},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":" How to Get Paid All of Your Earnings 12 such documents to the IRS. There is no provision for the employer to take any other action, such as firing the employee or refusing to pay him. Since I do not wish to apply for Social Security benefits, and since the W - 4 is the only official form on which the Social Security numbe r can be submitted, there is no reason to fill out the form. Personnel Chief: This all looks very official, but I know for a fact that IRS would come down on us if we allow you to work here without a Social Security number. New employee: You mean be penalized? Personnel Chief: Yeah. New employee: Do you know what the penalty is for an employer who fails to get a Social Security Account Number from a new employee? Personnel Chief: Not exactly. New employee: A fifty - dollar fine. But the fifty bucks onl y comes into play if you fail to report that you don’t have a number for a particular employee. Here is the section of the Code that lays out the penalty and here is the Code that provides a waiver of that penalty for those employers that follow the Code and send in an affidavit [shows personnel chief a highlighted printout of sections 6723 and 6724(a)]. Personnel Chief: Hmmm. This is too incredible to believe. You’ve made your point, so I’m not going to fire you, but this has got to go above my head. I can’t deal with this. New employee: Your CPA should be able to verify everything. Personnel Chief: Right. You’re still an employee for the time being, but this will have to go through him or our attorney or both of them, as well as the boss. New employe e: No problem. Here are the printouts of the Code we looked at. You are welcome to keep them. Meanwhile, I’d like to get started. Personnel Chief: You are still hired provisionally, but that is subject to a final ruling on the outcome of all this. You can work with Curtis Johnson until this is settled. He is in room 201 on the second floor. He’s expecting you. New employee: Thank you. I’ll head on up there. 2. Demeanor . Some cases will be much simpler and others much more difficult, if not seemingly impossible — but pertinent issues always remain the same. That is why it is relatively easy for anyone to be able to grasp the concepts and, using only the four Code sections cited above, become fluent in the subject. The most important thing is to mainta in a cordial, genuine tone with those you speak with; getting someone mad at you can wreck all the understanding you have established in an instant. 3. Sequence of events . Once someone is hired, he/she cannot be casually fired for an unfounded reason wit hout risking serious legal action. As shown just below, such agencies as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission may even get interested in helping you. The fact that one is officially hired and called “employee” is hard evidence of the illegitimacy of any attempt to then introduce a new, arbitrary condition of employment after the fact of being hired. If providing a SSAN were truly a requirement for employment, no one could be hired until he/she divulged a SSAN and signed a W - 4, an impossible state of affairs."},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":" How to Get Paid All of Your Earnings 13 4. Extortion . What you are up against is true organized crime : the Legal Masters of the World have artfully convinced the employer that the employer is a slave and is obligated to coerce and extort its employees on behalf of an uninvolved thir d party (IRS) and overwhelm employees with “an offer they can’t refuse.” G. Case Precedent . In a famous case involving a young man that did not want to obtain a SSAN — based on religious convictions — as a condition of employment at Taco Bell after being hire d, the court ruled that the boy did not have to obtain a SSAN in order to retain his right to work. The boy, 16 - year - old Bruce Hanson, won a $10,000 judgment, but also agreed not to work at Taco Bell, thus preserving Big Brother’s secret. In the court’s dismissal of the defendant’s motion to dismiss of March 9, 1992, the court stated: “ However, the court is unaware of, and ISC does not cite any federal law that requires termination of an employee because he or she refused to obtain a Social Security nu mber .” Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Information Systems Consulting Case No. CA3 - 92 - 0169 - T U.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division. There is no inherent difference between an aversion to a pply for a benefit (i.e. obtain and provide a SSAN) based on religious convictions and one based on any other reason. This is why Social Security Administration informs people — even after the SSAN is acquired — that use of the number is always voluntary. If use of the number is always voluntary, then no employer can lawfully introduce a new condition of employment (to use/obtain a SSAN) after the fact of hiring someone and entering into an employment contract. H. The ultimate argument . The Constitut ion says that , “ No State shall... pass any...Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts ...” (Article I, Section 10, Clause 6). 1. Unconstitutionality . After someone is hired, such as the boy in the Taco Bell case, contractually speaking, the employer is bound by the agreed - upon terms and conditions of the contract of employment with the new employee. If the Constitution has anything to do with this, there can be no law (i.e. no law can be introduced) that impairs the obligation of the contract of employment be tween employer and employee — but this is what occurs every time one is coerced into providing a SSAN in order to keep from being fired . 2. Non - existent law . The above reveals the pure unconstitutionality of one contracting party, the employer, seeking to coerce the other contracting party, the new employee, into applying for Social Security benefits by extorting a second contract with an unrelated, outside third party (IRS) by claiming existence of a law that mandates such act and making such act a requir ement in order for the employer to honor the terms of the original contract. Constitutionally speaking, after entering into an employment contract with a new employee, no employer can claim the existence of any law that impairs the employer’s contractual obligations in the contract. The reason this is true is because there is, in fact, no such law that allows it . The disinformation inculcated into the collective consciousness of American employers (vigorously assisted by esquires 14 ) cannot be supported by the factual existence of any such law.   14 Esquire: A man belonging to the higher order of English gentry, ranking immediately below a knight.... Applied to various officers in the service of a king... In the U.S. the title belongs officially to lawyers... Oxfo rd English Dictionary (1979)."},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":" How to Get Paid All of Your Earnings 14 3. Supreme Court . This issue has never been asserted in a court of law, but its time has come and this is what must be claimed. Based on the truth and gravity of this issue, any such move will undoubtedly invoke ma ximum resistance — but the simple truth of this contention cannot be denied and a jury should be able to be convinced of it based on the evidence. The Supreme Court would blow IRS’s cover by making a ruling on the unconstitutionality of such practice — blatan t use of a non - existent “law” (IRC) that impairs the obligation of a contract — and that bridge will likely have to be crossed as this issue continues to arise with employers. I. The task at hand . This is not a fair fight, and it was never intended to be a fair fight. We have been under martial law since March 27, 1861 when representatives from the seven Southern States walked out of congress (leaving congress without a quorum to adjourn) and Lincoln took over as commander - in - chief of the military and issu ed the first Executive Order (command). Things have gone downhill since then. Our gold has been swindled and we have been converted into indentured servants and given a number to use in order to obtain “credit” and “benefits” and work our whole life on t he new plantation to pay off an ever - increasing imaginary debt (the so - called “National Debt”). J. Ingredients for success . If you are to prevail against the odds and not be forced into “volunteering” for Social Security benefits against your will in orde r to keep from being fired by an employer, it may require a Herculean effort, including an explanation of what legal steps you will take if the employer does not follow the law and do the right thing. When you keep insisting that the employer follow the l aw and are unwavering in your resolve, many antagonists will eventually hear the truth in your urgings and capitulate and honor your wishes. Unfortunately, there will always be a small few that do not — but there is already a multitude of successes from peo ple with much less ammunition to work with than is revealed here. In nearly every instance, their success stems from their unflagging certainty of the rightness of their position, combined with enough evidence to convince the employer of the legitimacy of what they were proposing. K. IRS “bait and switch” . The income - tax hook is baited with Social Security benefits; i.e. if you want eligibility for Social Security benefits you have to do business with IRS, who then converts the SSAN into a taxpayer iden tification number and compels the employer to waylay your paycheck however IRS sees fit. The IRS Form W - 4 is the official vehicle for an employee to apply for Social Security benefits at his/her place of employment — and, per IRC, there is no other way for an employee to notify IRS. Therefore, both theoretically and practically speaking, if an employee does not want Social Security benefits on his earnings, there is no reason to notify IRS and provide a SSAN. That this decision also happens to short - circui t Big Brother’s dreams of as much as 40% – 60% of an employee’s paycheck is an unavoidable consequence. If an employee does not want Social Security benefits — benefits that can only be obtained through voluntary enrollment and participation in the Social S ecurity retirement program — no law can compel the employee to volunteer a SSAN on an IRS form and seek such benefits. L. Following Through . Let us say things result in a meeting with an executive of the firm. The exec can be handled via Registered Mail - Af fidavit of Mailing maybe more easily than he/she can with a personal meeting, but when the time comes you need to be fully prepared for anything and armed with the original of at least one letter from one of your congressmen, and a certified copy of said l etter (using a “Copy Certification by Document Custodian” form 15 ) for any company officer you may have to deal with.    15 See paragraph “C” on page 206 of Cracking the Code Third Edition for an explanation of the use of this form."},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":" How to Get Paid All of Your Earnings 15 1. Write your congressmen 16 now . Upon reading these words it is critical that you immediately draft and mail a letter for each of your sen ators and your U.S. representative that contains no more than two of the questions listed below. 17 Each letter should be as brief as possible and have a simple, plausible, compelling theme encapsulated (ideally) in one sentence (not more than two) that is deserving of an answer. [Note: The terms “American citizen” and “America” may be interchanged with “United States citizen” and “United States,” respectively.]: ? “Is a United States citizen required to obtain a Social Security number in order to live and wo rk in the United States?” ? “Is an American citizen required to provide a Social Security number in order to live and work in America?” ? “If I already have a Social Security number, is there any law that requires that I participate in Social Security where I work?” ? “Is there any law that requires a United States citizen to provide a Social Security number to be eligible for a benefit he does not desire?” ? “Is there any law prohibiting a United States citizen from working in the United States if he does not de sire Social Security benefits?” ? “Does an employer have the right to compel an employee to provide a Social Security number?” ? “Is there any law that allows an employer to compel an employee to provide a Social Security number in order to retain his job?” ? “I s there any law that allows an employer to refuse to pay an employee all of his earnings if the employee does not provide a Social Security number?” ? Is there any law that authorizes an employer to fire a new employee or withhold any of his pay if the new employee declines to provide a Social Security number and participate in Social Security? ? Is there any law that allows an employer to compel a new employee to provide a Social Security number and participate in Social Security if the new employee does not want Social Security benefits? ? Is there any law that requires a U.S. citizen to reveal his Social Security number in order to participate in the Social Security program where he works if he does not want to accumulate credit toward, and be eligible for, Social Security benefits on the money he earns there? 2. Properties of your letters . The above questions are well thought out and are designed to elicit a meaningful answer by piercing any veneer that might be used to gloss over such inquiries. Therefore , it is recommended that you not introduce alterations. Notice that the subjects of “IRS” and “W - 4” are never mentioned — only Social Security - related issues . Since Social Security is the advertised reason for filling out a W - 4, the issue of Social Securit y is all that is addressed. The shorter and more coherent, courteous, and ingenuous 18 the letter, 19 the better the response you   16 Visit http://www.civilrightsforum.org/cra/links. html for the DC address of all senators and representatives. 17 It is best to send your congressmen a duplicate letter at both their Washington, D.C. and local address; i.e. a total of six letters: two for each senator and two for your representative. 18 Ingenuous: Candid, frank, or open in character and quality; free from disguise; innocent; artless."},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":" How to Get Paid All of Your Earnings 16 will receive — and it is unwritten policy that all letters from constituents be answered (usually within 30 days). Antagonistic le tters may be met with a polite, hollow reply or ignored altogether, so avoid such approach. 3. Official, overwhelming validation . Do not be surprised if the answer you receive contains the exact statement you are hoping for. 20 Response letters from co ngressmen can be sent in and posted on the UCCSG web site for all to see and benefit from. Letters can then be downloaded and printed out (on a color printer, ideally) by anyone, and a whole book of congressional responses can be compiled to use in convin cing even the most stubborn of employers. M. Handling things in writing . An employer (i.e. any of the employer’s officers) can be handled with either/both of two types of written communication if necessary: affidavit 21 ; and letter. 1. Affidavits . The pu rpose of any affidavit used herein is twofold: (a) To establish a paper trail of evidence proving one’s intent — i.e. that one does not wish to volunteer for eligibility for Social Security benefits from the earnings one collects from a particular employer; and (b) To let the employer know that one cannot be muscled into “volunteering” to participate in Social Security and is capable of seeking legal remedies against the employer, foremost of which is breach of contract . 2. Letters . The purpose of any lette r is to state demands based on official policy of SSA, applicable sections of IRC and CFR, and personal responses from congressmen. Such demand letters should also have a (color) photocopy of all documents cited within (SSA policy and IRC and CFR sections are attached herewith), as well as a certified (color) copy of any letter from a congressman (using a “Copy Certification by Document Custodian” form, as mentioned above). 3. Documenting your position . Even when a company officer is personally handed wri tten communication by you, if there is any doubt whatsoever concerning the eventual outcome of the employment situation , cover yourself by sending the same written communication by Registered Mail, Restricted Delivery, Return Receipt Requested, Affidavit o f Mailing, thus enabling you to prove that the company officer received it. Remember: No matter how easy this may turn out to be in the end, you must be prepared for the absolute worst in the beginning and every step of the way thereafter — and building a p aper trail of evidence is the most prudent way to go about it. You are showing the employer that the actions taken by the employer against other reluctant SSAN holders for all these years is strictly on the employer’s own determinism and is not authorized by law. There cannot be too many employers that are happy to discover this, but many who will be heartened to do the right thing and follow the law from here on out.          19 This is also the perfect opportunity to establish a new return address that does not link up your TRADE NAME and address with the TRADE NAME’S SSAN in an I RS database (because your employer will see the response letter you receive from your congressmen). 20 For those fortunate enough to be in Representative Ron Paul’s district in Texas, you should get a strong response. [Note: It is not unreasonable for an y Texan to write Ron Paul and seek answers for these questions.] 21 See “Affidavit Properties” in the Document Archive section of www.uccsg.com for a treatment of the nature and of characteristics of an affidavit."},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":" How to Get Paid All of Your Earnings 17 II. Current Employers and Voluntary Compliance with the Law . A. Currently employed . A lthough this can be a much more difficult situation to remedy than the one discussed in Part I (where the employer does not have a SSAN for a new employee), the fundamental issues are the same and anyone in this latter category that has not read pages 1 th rough 16 in entirety needs to do so before continuing with this Part. B. The nature of the beast . Nearly all people who are currently employed and want to withdraw from participation in the Social Security retirement benefits program are seeing between 30 % and 50% of their paycheck disappear (some are losing more) as a direct result of their employer having their SSAN on a signed IRS Form W - 4 Employee’s Withholding Allowance Certificate. This apparently innocent little document is actually the cornerstone of the entire Federal Reserve System confidence game (initiated November 22, 1910 in Jeckyll Island, Georgia and memorialized December 23, 1913 in the Federal Reserve Act of 1913), because without ongoing, unfettered exploitation of unwitting “volunteers” via the W - 4, the inherently fraudulent nature of the financial system is exposed. As revealed in Cracking the Code Third Edition , all money is literally borrowed into existence ; i.e. no bank actually ever loans anything of value (is forbidden to do so by banking regulations) in a so - called “loan transaction.” The so - called loan is funded by the alleged borrower’s promise - to - pay (promissory note; credit application), which is treated as a deposit (just like any other deposit in a demand deposit account — e. g. checking, savings) and then converted into Federal Reserve Notes without the alleged borrower’s knowledge or consent and returned as the “loan” (the foregoing procedure is verifiable with any CPA). Unless vast sums of Federal Reserve Notes (FRN’s) are regularly extracted from circulation in the form of income and other types of taxes (various fines associated with use of FRN’s that accrue for the benefit of the owners of the FRN’s) the money supply goes out the roof and rampant inflation 22 ensues. Such events do not take place in a substance - backed monetary system (such as the gold - backed system that this country enjoyed until as recently as 1913) and reflect on the intentions and activities of the custodians of the private money supply (Fed owners and o perators) and can lead to serious demands for accountability from the constituency (such as recently seen in Argentina and other South American countries, all of which now embrace other lawful, alternative forms of money, money substitutes, and systems of barter). FRN’s extracted from the paychecks of hundreds of millions of American employees constitute the bulk of the foundation of Big Brother’s ability to continue to operate the Federal Reserve confidence game. Deciding to opt out of the Social Securit y Ponzi scheme and completely and lawfully remove all of one’s earnings from the realm of taxation is not something that is looked upon kindly by Big Brother’s legions (e.g. CPA’s, attorneys of all kinds, judges, government officials, etc. whose economic e xistence is predicated on the survival of the system) and can generate massive resistance (because it signals the beginning of the end of Federal Reserve domination and control). When you undertake to handle a current employer and get the employer to hono r your wishes to cease participating in Social Security, this is the monster that you seek to escape. Its propensity for blind hatred and lawlessness toward upstart slaves (you) is not to be underestimated.    22 In flation is an economic condition wherein there is relatively more money available to buy products than there are products available for sale (seller’s market; e.g. the Roaring 20’s). Deflation is an economic condition wherein there is a relative abundance of products for sale, but not enough money available with which to purchase them (buyer’s market; e.g. the Great Depression)."},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":" How to Get Paid All of Your Earnings 18 C. The route out . You have “volunteered” to participate in the Social Security retirement benefits program by placing your TRADE NAME’S SSAN on a signed W - 4, a sworn proclamation that you are taxpayer and liable for the income tax. Your saving grace (and route out) is the fact that this is an unco nscionable bargain, 23 established not via just one, but all five factors that vitiate 24 a contract by nullification of the consent factor: duress; menace; fraud; undue influence; and mistake (attached herewith 25 ). Your task is to show your employer how each of these points is binding you detrimentally against your will and thereby obtain the employer’s agreement to honor the fact of the legal non - existence of the ink marks and data on the W - 4. D. Documents . The following can be undertaken both verbally and in writing; the magnitude of the opposition one is faced with dictates which method is more appropriate, if not both. 1. Official endorsement . Immediately draft a letter for your senators and representative in congress as described in paragraphs “L.1” th rough “L.3” beginning on page 15 of this essay and obtain as many favorable responses as possible. There is nothing prohibiting you from also writing the Commissioner of Social Security, the general counsel of the Social Security Administration, and any o ther similarly involved offi cial — because all are hamstrung 26 by the nature of the questions appearing on page 15 and cannot answer truthfully without helping your cause. (a) Send in favorable responses from congressmen and government officials by scanning and emailing or by color photocopying and snail - mailing such letters for posting on the www.uccsg.com web site under “Congressional Responses” in the Document Archive section. (b) Check under “Congressional Responses” in th e Document Archive section at www.uccsg.com for letters from government officials confirming the voluntary nature of use of a Social Security Account Number and download and print a color copy for use in handling your employer. 2. Affidavit . Immediately begin composing an affidavit that is in conformity with “Affidavit Properties” and “Sample Affidavit with Instructions” in the Document Archive section of www.uccsg.com . A sworn a ffidavit constitutes evidence (testimony), and this affidavit must document : (a) Vitiating factors . The fact of duress, menace, fraud, undue influence, and mistake — each taken up individually in its own separately numbered paragraph(s) in intimate, moment - to - moment detail (unfolding like a motion picture in sequence, clarity, and vividness) — that is responsible for the W - 4 and SSAN currently on file at IRS courtesy of the employer. Consult a dictionary for the exact meaning of each of the above five terms to ensure absolute accuracy in the affidavit. Include all events and all parties (e.g. media article/stories , school teachers, politicians, IRS personnel/literature, etc.) influencing your decision to provide a SSAN and sign the W - 4. If you are unable to determine exactly how one of the five factors bears upon your situation, omit any discussion of such point in the affidavit.    23 Unconscionable bargain: A contract which no man in his senses, not under delusion, would make, on the one hand, and which no fair and honest man would accept, on the other. Black’s Law Dictionary , First Edition (1891). 24 Vitiate: To make legally ineffective. 25 See also contract in Glossary. 26 Hamstrung: Made ineffective or powerless."},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":" How to Get Paid All of Your Earnings 19 (b) Void W - 4 . The fact that the ink marks and signature appearing on the original, subject W - 4 in question (and the toner marks on any photocopy of the original W - 4 in the possession of the employer) are not your ink marks and signature per all applicable points listed in subparagraph “2(a)” immediately above, thus nullifying any alleged effectiveness of said document. The affidavit must positively state these facts. (c) No authorization . Now that the W - 4 contract is voided, any use/disclosure of the SSAN by the employer is not authorized and any and all unauthorized use/ disclosure of the SSAN is expressly forbidden and so stated. 3. Demand letter . Although some employers/employer personnel can be successfully handled on the points discussed below using only dialogue, nothing is guaranteed and generally this is not known until after the fact. Therefore, to maximize chances of succe ss, construct a demand letter in accordance with paragraph “M.2” on page 16 and also consider the following: (a) Heading . Generally not advisable to place any type of heading on a letter, but there may be circumstances where this is appropriate. (b) Con tents . The letter needs to cite applicable sections from attached (and certified/notarized, where possible/appropriate) documentation, and must make definitive demands based on: (i) Statutory code re contracts (citing the five points that can vitiate a contract); (ii) SSA policy from the official SSA web site (re the fact of “mistake”); (iii) Applicable sections of IRC and CFR (granted, this may appear to be a moot point, and may be omitted if desired, but these issues can be used to show the employer what the employer needs to do from this point forward, and may cause the employer to reconsider the employer’s stance on the W - 4 currently on file); (iv) Favorable quotes in any letter from any government official; (v) Article I, Section 10, Clause 6 of th e Constitution of the United States (of America); and (vi) Evidence contained in the affidavit described immediately above in paragraph “D.2.” (c) Intention . Without provoking the employer unduly, your written communication should reflect a quiet r esolve to pursue matters via legal means if necessary. (d) Transmission . Different types of personnel present different obstacles: sometimes it is sufficient to hand over documentation in person (as in a meeting), and other times it is best to use Registered Mail. Analyze your options carefully and choose the most advantageous approach with each personnel. Generally, if there is any doubt whatsoever about the outcome of your situation, including a potential reversal of a positive current state of affairs, you must, in order to create a paper trail you can rely on to document your position and keep the employer on the employer’s best behavior, immediately send any and all concerned personnel"},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":" How to Get Paid All of Your Earnings 20 the same documentation by Registered Mail, Restricted Deli very, Return Receipt Requested, Affidavit of Mailing. You never want to shoot yourself in the foot by giving the impression of overkill , however, so any such mailing is best tempered with a simple cover letter citing the meeting and that this is merely yo ur way of obtaining official confirmation of receipt of documents. D. Preparedness . Remember what is at stake and never underestimate what objections may need to be fielded and defused through documentary evidence in any meeting with any personnel. In s hort, you need to be fully prepared for the absolute worst from the very beginning. E. Demeanor . As stated in Part I, get someone mad at you and you can destroy all the positive gains you make. You do not want to come off as a milquetoast, 27 but you also do not want to use any more effort and insistence than is necessary to get the desired result. Always conduct yourself in a calm, courteous manner, no matter the provocation. The party that shows the most level - headedness usually prevails. You are hold ing all the Aces; the only way to blow things is if you do not know it. F. Legal action . The main wrong being committed by an employer in such a situation is violation of privacy via unauthorized use of the SSAN. The W - 4 is invalidated by the affidavit ( evidence) and lawfully cannot be superseded by anything less than a point - for - point counteraffidavit sworn true, correct, and complete. In the event the employer chooses to continue to conspire with IRS and use and disclose private information after notif ication of lawful negation of the alleged W - 4 (the alleged W - 4 is no longer signed and the SSAN no longer appears on the alleged W - 4 once the affidavit is notarized and served on the employer and goes unrebutted), it is not unreasonable to consider legal a ction based on the correctness of your position as established in the documents referenced in paragraph “D.3.(b)” on page 19 of this essay. G. Criminal matters . Once any alleged authorization to use/disclose the SSAN is nullified by vitiating factors th at are attested in a sworn affidavit, the employer has no legal basis to continue to use/disclose said SSAN, irrespective of any acts apparently compelled of the employer by IRC, and any such further unauthorized use/disclosure is willful. Title 42 United States Code, Chapter 7, Subchapter II, Section 408 is very clear on the penalties for illegal use/disclosure of a SSAN: “ (a) In general... Whoever... (8) discloses, uses, or compels the disclosure of the social security number of any person in violation of the laws of the United States; shall be guilty of a felony and upon conviction thereof shall be fined under title 18 or imprisoned for not more than five years, or both .” 42 USC 408 Penalties Also, should an employer illegally seek to compel a new emplo yee to disclose a SSAN — e.g. to compel the employee seek Social Security benefits against his/her will — as a condition of employment, the above statute also appears to have applicability.    27 Milquetoast: Any timid or excessively apo logetic person."},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":" How to Get Paid All of Your Earnings 21 Answers As k a Question My Notification Requests Help Category Social Security Numbers and Cards All Subcategories Search Text (optional) Search Tips?

Question Must I provide a Social Security number (SSN) to any business or government agency that asks? Answer The Social Security number (SSN) was originally devised to keep an accurate record of each individual’s earnings, and to subsequently monitor benefits paid under the Social Security program. However, use of the SSN as a general identifier has grown to the point where it is the most commonly used and convenient identifier for all types of record - keeping systems in the United States. Specific laws require a person to provide his/her SSN for certain purposes. While we c annot give you a comprehensive list of all situations where an SSN might be required or requested, an SSN is required/requested by: · Internal Revenue Service for tax returns and federal loans · Employers for wage and tax reporting purposes · States for the school lunch program · Banks for monetary transactions · Veterans Administration as a hospital admission number · Department of Labor for workers’ compensation · Department of Education for Student Loans · States to administer any tax, general public a ssistance, motor vehicle or drivers license law within its jurisdiction · States for child support enforcement · States for commercial driver’s licenses · States for Food Stamps · States for Medicaid · States for Unemployment Compensation · States for Tem porary Assistance to Needy Families "},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":" How to Get Paid All of Your Earnings 22 · U.S. Treasury for U.S. Savings Bonds The Privacy Act regulates the use of SSNs by government agencies. When a Federal, State, or local government agency asks an individual to disclose his or her Social Security numbe r, the Privacy Act requires the agency to inform the person of the following: the statutory or other authority for requesting the information; whether disclosure is mandatory or voluntary; what uses will be made of the information; and the consequences, if any, of failure to provide the information. If a business or other enterprise asks you for your SSN, you can refuse to give it. However, that may mean doing without the purchase or service for which your number was requested. For example, utility compan ies and other services ask for a Social Security number, but do not need it; they can do a credit check or identify the person in their records by alternative means. Giving your number is voluntary, even when you are asked for the number directly. If reque sted, you should ask why your number is needed, how your number will be used, what law requires you to give your number and what the consequences are if you refuse.

Should any provision of this Notice by Written Communication be unenforceable, said unenforceable provision is hereby severed from this Notice by Written Communication, but every re maining provision continues in full force and effect, and this Notice by Written Communication is deemed modified in a manner that renders this Notice by Written Communication in full force and effect. In all cases Secured Party continues without liabilit y and is held harmless. Any prior communication, written document, and the like by and between User and Secured Party containing any mistake of Secured Party is invalidated thereby and of no force and effect, and may not be relied upon by User against Sec ured Party in this matter. No consent of any kind is granted nor otherwise given re any matter offered/alleged/asserted by User, and Secured Party withholds all consent. Secured Party will consider granting consent in favor of User only upon User’s full disclosure of any and all consequences of any such granting of consent, accompanied by User’s commensurate attendant liability for the veracity, relevance, and verifiability of any such disclosure, which liability is borne by User in the form of an a uthenticated Security Agreement, wherein User is debtor and John Henry Doe © is Secured Party, that self - executes effective the moment of Secured Party’s confirmation of any material inconsistency/deviation/discrepancy in the aforementioned resultant conseq uences avowed by User, as determined solely by Secured Party in Secured Party’s sole discretion. Alleged debtor, i.e. JOHN H. DOE © , does not take issue with the amount of any alleged debt; rather, alleged debtor asserts that: the alleged debt is not valid; Secured Party holds a claim/security interest greater than any claim alleged by User, a copy of which filed UCC Financing Statement evidencing such supreme claim and security interest is attached herewith, made fully part hereof, and included herein by reference; and, as stated above, Secured Party is neither a surety, nor an accommodation party, for alleged debtor, and may not be construed as functioning in such capacity under any circumstances. Further, this is a request for validation of any a lleged debt and is not a request for a copy of any invoice, statement, bill, agreement, alleged agreement, contract, alleged contract, and the like, nor is it a request for a copy of any notification of assignment, negotiation/transfer of rights, nor is it a request for a copy of any other un - verified document/presentment referencing said alleged debt. This request for validation of any alleged debt is a request for bona fide verification of any alleged debt. In accordance with law, only sworn affidavi ts, oaths, and depositions qualify as a verification of the lawful existence of a bona fide debt. Absent such verification validating the alleged debt, and absent proof of a claim greater than that of Secured Party, User “fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.” Wherefore, in accordance with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act , effective immediately upon User’s receipt of this Notice by Written Communication, User must cease all collection/prosecution efforts against alleged debtor, Se cured Party, and Secured Party’s secured private property. User is hereby notified of the following Privacy Act Notice: Privacy Act Notice This written Notice by Written Communication constitutes User’s due - process notice and opportunity to be he ard. Absent compliance with all requirements set forth herein User is barred from using any defense of immunity from prosecution for User’s actions, as well as the actions of User’s agents. By this Notice By Written Communication, User, as well as Use r’s agents and principals, shall comply with the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, as lawfully amended, 12 U.S.C. § 3401, the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978, as lawfully amended, 5 U.S.C. § 552a, and the Third Party Summons Act, special proced ures, 26 U.S.C. § 7609 as lawfully amended, to assist Secured Party in keeping inviolate certain constitutionally protected privacy rights.

DOE © , and likewise concerning Secured Party. User’s failure to provide said foregoing demanded authorization constitutes admission by User that User is in violati on of the Privacy Act, as well as other laws. User possesses neither express, written authorization, nor consent, from alleged debtor, JOHN H. DOE © , nor Secured Party, to use, reveal/disclose/divulge/share with any third party, and the like, any secure d information, documentation, data, property, effects, and the like of Secured Party. This Notice By Written Communication is binding upon every principal and agent re the subject matter set forth herein, and each principal and each agent is: (a) barr ed from providing any Credit Reporting Agency any derogatory credit information regarding the above alleged debt; (b) prohibited from contacting alleged debtor by mail, by telephone, as well as in person, both at alleged debtor’s residence, as well as at a lleged debtor’s place of employment; and (c) prohibited from contacting any other third party regarding the above - referenced alleged debt until User establishes the existence of a superior claim, greater than that of Secured Party’s, and until said alleged debt is verified as indicated above and alleged debtor is provided with any such verification. Note: the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act at 15 USC §1692 et seq. states in relevant part that: “ A debt collector may not use any false, deceptive, or misle ading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt ,” which includes “ the false representation of the character, or legal status of any debt ,” as well as “ the threat to take any action that cannot legally be taken ,” all of which con stitute violations of law. Therefore, User, as well as any assignee, is prohibited from filing any lawsuit, notice of lien, notice of levy, and the like, as well as any other legal action against alleged debtor, as well as against any of Secured Party’s s ecured private property, which is exempt from lien and exempt from levy . 15 U.S.C. § 1692e(8) states: “Communicating or threatening to communicate to any person credit information which is known or which should be known to be false, including the failu re to communicate that a disputed debt is disputed, is a violation of § 1692e.” Further, User’s above - referenced written communication, if valid, constitutes an issue of public currency , and, alleged debtor hereby requests from User, in accordance with the fundamental principals of American jurisprudence and law, bona fide documentary evidence that establishes the lawful basis for User’s issue of said public currency and User’s claim for payment of the alleged debt liability referenced within User’s wri tten communication issuing the public currency and stating the claim, i.e.: (a) bona fide identification of any person making request for payment by JOHN H. DOE © , including a copy of said person’s bona fide, handwritten, legible, and notarized signature, a nd the thumbprint, from either hand, of said person making request for payment by JOHN H. DOE © ; (b) bona fide evidence of any said person’s authority to make a request for payment by JOHN H. DOE © , if said person is acting on behalf of another; and (c) ex hibition of the bona fide instrument, i.e., the bona fide commercial contract bearing the bona fide signature which supports User’s demand for payment of alleged debt by JOHN H. DOE © , that, operating publicly, establishes User’s issue of public currency, a llegedly collectable from any of: (i) alleged debtor; (ii) alleged debtor’s assets, (iii) Secured Party; (iv) Secured Party’s secured private property; and (d) positive law in support of User’s written attempt to collect alleged debt that, operating public ly, establishes User’s issue of public currency collectable from any of: (i) alleged debtor; (ii) alleged debtor’s assets, (iii) Secured Party; (iv) Secured Party’s secured private property. Alleged debtor and Secured Party can and will lawfully constr ue User’s failure to comply with and satisfy essential requirements of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and the above four (4) requests, i.e. “(a),” “(b),” “(c),” and “(d)” in the paragraph immediately above, within a reasonable time, i.e. twenty - one (21) days, following User’s receipt of this written communication, as User’s self - invalidation of User’s demand for payment. Verification of the alleged debt and satisfaction of the aforementioned four (4) specific requests must be duly affirmed in the f orm of one of the following: (a) affidavit; (b) oath; (c) deposition. Until the alleged debt is verified in accordance with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and said verification is sent alleged debtor and received by alleged debtor, each and ever y contact in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act constitutes harassment and defamation of character and makes User, as well as any and all agents and principals who take part in such harassment and defamation, a subject of liability for dam ages, as well as statutory damages, and legal fees, for each and every violation, in private capacity. User, JACK JONES , tacitly consents and agrees that JACK JONES has a duty to prevent this alleged account from damaging both alleged debtor and Secur ed Party, and further consents and agrees that alleged debtor and Secured Party each reserve the right to initiate a counterclaim, as well as a claim, against any of the following: JACK JONES ‘S bond;"},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"JONES, JACK 5143 Tunnel Vision Drive, Columbus, OH 43222 Respondent’s Private Int ernational Administrative Remedy Demand No. JHD - 032802 - JJ Page 5 of 14 JACK JONES ‘S guarantor; any of JACK JONES ‘S principals, agents, and assignees whose act(s)/omission(s) results in either of the following: (a) tort damages against alleged debtor; (b) tort damages against Secured Party.

In all cases Secured Party continues without liability and is held harmless. Any prior communication, written document, and the like by and between User and Secured Party containing any mistake of Secured Party is invalidated thereby and of no force and effect, and may not be relied upon by User against Secured Party in this matter. No consent of any kind is granted nor otherwise given re any matter offered/alleged/asserted by User, and Secured Party withholds all consent. Secured Party will consider granting consent in favor of User only upon User’s full disclosure of any and all consequences of any such granting of consent, accompanied by User’s commensurate attendant liability for the veracity, relevance, and verifiability of any such disclosure, which liability is borne by User in the form of an authenticated Security Agreement, wherein User is debtor and John Henry Doe © is Secured Party, that self - executes effective the moment of Secured Party’s confirmation of any material inconsiste ncy/deviation/discrepancy in the aforementioned resultant consequences avowed by User, as determined solely by Secured Party in Secured Party’s sole discretion. Alleged debtor, i.e. JOHN H.

Further, this is a request for validation of any alleged debt and is not a request for a copy of any invoice, statement, bill, agreement, alleged agreement, contract, alleged contract, and the like, nor is it a request for a copy of any notif ication of assignment, negotiation/transfer of rights, nor is it a request for a copy of any other un - verified document/presentment referencing said alleged debt. This request for validation of any alleged debt is a request for bona fide verification of a ny alleged debt. In accordance with law, only sworn affidavits, oaths, and depositions qualify as a verification of the lawful existence of a bona fide debt. Absent such verification validating the alleged debt, and absent proof of a claim greater tha n that of Secured Party, User “fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.” Wherefore, in accordance with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act , effective immediately upon User’s receipt of this Notice by Written Communication, User must cea se all collection/prosecution efforts against alleged debtor, Secured Party, and Secured Party’s secured private property.

The theories by which this mode of legal operation has developed, has been justified, qualified, and defined are the subject matter of a very sizable library. The historic roots of a particular society, economic pressures, philosophic notions, all have had their share in the law’s response to the ways of men in carrying on their affairs t hrough what is now the familiar device of the corporation. ------ Attribution of legal rights and duties to a juristic person other than man is necessarily a metaphorical process. And none the worse for it. No doubt, ‘Metaphors in law are to be narrowly watched.’” Cardozo, J., in Berkey v . Third Avenue R. Co., 244 N.Y. 84, 94. “But all instruments of thought should be narrowly watched lest they be abused and fail in their service to reason.” See U.S. v . SCOPHONY CORP.
