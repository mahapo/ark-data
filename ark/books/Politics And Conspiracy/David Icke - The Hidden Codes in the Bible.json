[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" The Hidden Codes in the Bible by Roy A. Reinhold Recently, THE BIBLE CODE, a book by Michael Drosnin burst on to the scene, proposing that there are hidden coded texts recording all of history in the Hebrew textus receptus (the Masoretic text) of the Torah. Already, THE BIBLE CODE has reached number 5 on the New York Times bestseller list. In view of the findings, the Bible can be viewed as a 3-D hologram with the surface text as the outside layer and the hidden texts found at equidistant letter spacing (ELS) on the inside layers. A computer program is available to search for words with up to 10,000 spaces between letters in the surface text. Previously, Grant Jeffrey had touched on many of the same findings in THE BIBLE CODE in his book, THE SIGNATURE OF GOD (1996, chapters 10 & 11). Also, Yacov Rambsel had been finding (by hand) the name \"Yeshua\" embedded under the Messianic prophecies in the Old Testament (Tanakh), in his 1996 book, YESHUA, THE NAME OF JESUS REVEALED IN THE OLD TESTAMENT. Yacov Rambsel is a Messianic Jewish pastor in San Antonio, Texas, who searched the Hebrew texts for a couple of decades by hand without the aid of a computer. He found the term \"Yeshua is my name\" under the text of Isaiah 53:10 using every 20th letter. Isaiah 53:10 is about the suffering Messiah, and for our Jewish friends, how fortunate that God our Father embedded the name of the Messiah Yeshua (Jesus) there for all to find. Another example is Zechariah 11:12, where the surface text prophesies the price that Judas would eventually receive for his act of betrayal, 30 pieces of silver. Underneath the surface text at a spacing of 24 letters is the name hidden, \"Yeshua\". Many more examples are given throughout the book, YESHUA, THE NAME OF JESUS REVEALED IN THE OLD TESTAMENT. While there are dedicated scholars like Yacov Rambsel, who would labor for decades to find a few of these hidden codes, the use of the computer speeds up the process immensely. For example, using the skip sequencing software, one could find all the examples where the name \"Yeshua\" is hidden under the surface text, in about 50 minutes. This is more than someone by hand could find in a lifetime of diligent searching. By the way, if you know Hebrew, you can purchase a commercial version of the skip sequencing software from an Israeli software company (Computronic Corp.) with the Hebrew Torah in the correct form included. Grant Jeffrey sells the software on his website for $99.95 (includes s&h), titled, TORAH CODES software (DOS, Windows & Mac versions available). Torah Educational Software sells the TORAH CODES software online for $79.95 (plus s&h). Davka Corp. in Chicago, sells the newest CD version for PCs for $69.95 (plus s&h). Dr. Eliyahu Rips, a renowned Israeli mathematician, found the codes along with Dr. Doron Witzum and Dr. Yoav Rosenberg and published a peer reviewed paper in the Statistical Science Journal (1994, Volume 9, No. 3, pages 429-438), titled, EQUIDISTANT LETTER SEQUENCES IN THE BOOK OF GENESIS. The journal spent considerable time having the findings fully tested before they published the research article. Since then, they've found that the hidden codes are throughout all the books of the Tanakh, in the original Hebrew.xxx One test they ran was to pick out the names of the 66 Rabbis with the longest write-ups in the Jewish Encyclopedia. All 66 names were found embedded in the book of Genesis, along with either their birth date or date of death. In the review process for publication, Professor Harold Gans, a US cryptographic code-breaker expert, re-ran the experiment looking for the name of the city in which each of the 66 rabbis was known for, and found the name of the city hidden along with the name and date for each Rabbi. The odds against finding these hidden codes were over 10 million to one."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Another example given in the book, THE BIBLE CODE, is to look for the name Hitler. They found it, and close by to the term \"Hitler\" were the terms \"evil man\", \"Nazi and enemy\", and \"slaughter\". \"In Germany\" was found embedded near the terms, \"Nazis\" and \"Berlin\". The term \"Eichmann\" was found embedded with the terms, \"the ovens\" and \"extermination\". The term \"Zyklon-B\" the gas used to kill the Jews was found embedded near the term \"Eichmann\". I should tell you that the author of the book, THE BIBLE CODE, Michael Drosnin, is an agnostic, and is a former reporter for the Washington Post and Wall Street Journal. Dr. Eliyahu Rips is a practicing Orthodox Jew in Israel. So none of the people working on THE BIBLE CODES is a believer in Jesus. They found imbedded in the Bible codes, both assasinations of the Kennedys along with their assassins and other information. They found the assasination of Prime Minister Rabin of Israel with the date and the last name of his killer, Amir. Very amazing don't you think? They did a test looking for the name \"Shakespeare\" and found it embedded with the terms \"presented on stage\", \"Macbeth\", and \"Hamlet\" nearby. They found the names \"Beethoven\" and \"Johann Bach\" and nearby both is the term \"German composer\". \"Mozart\" is found embedded near the terms \"music\" and \"composer\". \"Wright Brothers\" are encoded near the term \"airplane\". \"Edison\" is encoded near the terms \"electricity\" and \"lightbulb\". \"Marconi\" is embedded near the term \"radio\". I'm giving all of these examples to show you the immensity of this find, history pre-recorded in the Bible codes over 3000 years ago. This is no fluke or fake finding! Now I'd like to discuss the possibilities in the Bible codes connected with prophecy and looking for future events. I don't believe anyone has endeavored to search the New Testament in the Greek looking for hidden codes within the text. It would not surprise me at all if the codes are there. I propose that if you are a Greek scholar, you investigate the hidden codes in the Greek. Perhaps a committee of knowledgeable prophecy scholars and writers could be set up to pose questions and terms to look for; that would have immense value. One controversial term that would be nice to know, is, who is the restrainer in 2 Thessalonians 2? Countless arguments and papers have been written saying that the restrainer is the church, believers, human government, the Holy Spirit, or the Archangel Michael. If the Greek New Testament contains hidden codes, perhaps we could find out the correct answer. Another question that could be posed, is concerning the two witnesses of Revelation 11. Who are the two witnesses? Moses and Elijah? Enoch and Elijah? You get the picture, we could find out some important prophetic knowledge. One other possibility is the controversial texts, for example, Mark 16:9-20. Some manuscripts didn't have these verses and if there is a hidden code in the Greek, then these controversial texts should continue the codes. If they don't, there is less credence for accepting their authenticity. You all get the picture, we as the church could gain immensely from a systematic search for the hidden codes in the New Testament. Will some Theological Seminary pick up the ball and run with this one? The commercial software is available, and all you need is the Greek text stripped of punctuation marks and blank spaces, and you can begin the research project. (I don't know Greek, so don't ask, \"why doesn't he just do it himself?\") One last cautionary note before we delve into the prophetic implications. All those involved in the ELS research caution that we don't know enough specific knowledge of how the Creator of the codes intended a nearness of terms at the same ELS, to apply and form a meaningful set of data. For example, if near terms are found at the same letter spacing, do they always apply to each other, or are there other nearby terms which are the intended correct association of terms? Without caution, we could mix up terms in close proximity and form a prediction of the future which was never intended by God our Father, the Creator of the codes and Author of the Bible. However, the evidence of past historical events recorded thousands of years ago in Bible prophecy and the Bible codes, means that future events are also there. We just need to exercise caution in our searching of the codes, as well as common"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"sense. Also, the philosophical question arises, just how much free will do we have, if the historical record was written down beforehand in prophecy and the Bible codes? The answer is that we have free will, but the Author of the Bible and the codes is God, who stands outside the creation and is not the creation itself as so many new-agers would have you believe. Being outside of the creation, He is able to view all of history and each person's life and choices and see what they choose. Pre-knowledge does not negate free will. Implications of THE BIBLE CODE in prophecy In chapter 6, a couple of findings from the book, THE BIBLE CODE, hit me like a ton of bricks. The term \"world war\" was encoded with the term \"in 5766\" for the possible year. In another place, the term \"atomic holocaust\" was encoded with the term \"in 5766\". In another place the term \"great earthquake\" was encoded with the term \"in 5766.\" In another place, the term \"great earthquake\" was encoded with \"Japan\" and \"in 5766.\" And in another place the term \"economic collapse\" was encoded with the term \"fire, earthquake struck Japan.\" For those of you who don't know, the year 5766 runs from October 4, 2005 to September 22, 2006. These dates are from Rosh Hashanah in 2005 to the day before the next Rosh Hashanah in 2006. The dates are from the current Jewish calender. For example, June 26, 1997 is Sivan 21 of 5757, and the year 5758 begins on Rosh Hashanah, which is October 2, 1997. The implications of the year 5766 could be staggering. I'd like to make some preliminary proposals subject to revision and correction. Please, please, please, consider the following a \"what if\" type of scenario. If, if, if, if, if the hidden codes are correct in the above association of terms concerning the year 5766, then the following is possible. You may or may not know that I've previously calculated a rolling table of dates for the end-times 7 year period through 2037 AD, which will not be narrowed down to a specific starting year as truth until the peace treaty of prophecy occurs. The explanations for the calculations of the table of dates is explained in my Prophecy Tape Album offered on this website. Central to the calculations of the table of dates is the fulfillment of the fall feast days of Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, and Succoth. I offer the Prophecy Tape Album to teach what God has taught to me. (local link at the bottom of this page to get info about or order the tapes). If, if, if, if and only if the Bible codes are correct in citing the year 5766 as the time when world war 3 occurs, then from my table of dates, World War 3 will start immediately after the abomination of desolation in the Temple on 31 January/1 February 2006. That means working backwards, the peace treaty of prophecy will occur on 19/20 September 2002. That also means that Jesus (Yeshua) will come to reign on the earth 1290 days after the abomination of desolation on 13/14 August 2009. The fulfillment of prophecy of Yom Kippur will occur on 27/28 September 2009, and the fulfillment of Succoth after the judgment of the peoples of the earth will occur on 2/3 October 2009 and run for 8 days. The Bible states that there will be a great earthquake when Israel is invaded in World War 3, in Ezekiel 38:19, so the term \"great earthquake\" associated with \"in 5766\", and in another place \"atomic holocaust\" with \"in 5766\", meets one test of reasonableness with the prophetic scriptures. In modern contemporary prophecies, C. Alan Martin's vision of the presidents on his PROPHECY SUPERSITE website, also meets the test of reasonableness. His vision saw two presidents after Clinton before the millennium period (not the year 2000). That time frame seems about right. Other modern prophecies have stated that World War 3 will start after an economic collapse, which fits the terms from THE BIBLE CODE. (remote link to C. Alan Martin's vision of the presidents at the bottom of the page).Another test of reasonableness may be applied to St. Malachy's prophetic vision of 112 popes before the judgment"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"of the people of the earth at the end of the 7 year end-times period. I am not a Catholic and there are always doubts as to the authenticity of the list of popes, but it's worthy of discussion. Malachy saw a vision in 1139 AD of all the future popes until the end. The current pope, John Paul II, would be called \"ab laboris solis\" (from the labor of the sun) the 110th on Malachy's list, and would be the 3rd to the last pope. The next pope is called \"gloria olivae\" (glorious olive, and may be of Jewish descent?). The last pope on the list is \"petrus romanus\" (Peter the Roman), who it is said will lead the church through much tribulation and then the city of seven hills will be destroyed and the powerful , terrible Judge will come to judge the world. The list of popes seems to meet the test of reasonableness possible for the time frame above with the dates for the end-times 7 year period. (local link to short article on St. Malachy's prophecy at the bottom of the page). Another modern prophecy through my brother in the faith, Thomas S. Gibson, given on December 7, 1995, prophesies a judgment on America in world war 3. In that prophecy, we are told that by 2005 the war will not yet have occurred, but by 2010 it will be in the past. My calculation of world war 3 beginning right after the abomination of desolation on 31 January/1 February 2006, meets the test of reasonableness with regards to that prophetic Word. (At the bottom of the page is a local link to five prophecies through Thomas S. Gibson relating to world war 3, read them and ponder the predicted events and the association to the conclusions in this article.) A new prophecy through Thomas on 9/27/97, concerning 3 distinct and easily recognizable events to presage or coincide with the start of the end-times 7 year period, has been recently added. When you view the development of the European Union with its related consequences to the prophetic picture, and the proposed monetary union of the countries into a single currency, the Euro, in 1999, these future events seem to fit the bill. If the EU adopts a single currency in 1999, then a closer compact between 1999 and 2002 into a European superstate seems plausible. What I'm getting at, is that the contemporary picture appears to reasonably fit the time frame mentioned above. This article raises quite a number of interesting possibilities. One, that the Bible codes are put there by God our Father for us to know in the last days or end-times period. And two, that He intends for us to search the scriptures and find out the prophetic scenario clues hidden in the codes, which will always confirm and augment the surface text of the Bible, if true. I firmly believe that these hidden Bible codes are a fulfillment of Daniel 12:9, where the Angel told Daniel that, \"these words are concealed and sealed up until the end time.\" WHAT DO YOU THINK? Please e-mail me to provide helpful analyses, or criticisms, I can take the heat. May God my Father bless you greatly in your understanding of the Word of God, the Bible. If you are angry that I would have the audacity to publish the dates of the end-times events (except the rapture), please read the following adjunct to this article, it will address your concerns.

Yom Kippur fulfillment & judgment of the people of the earth starts 27/28 September 2009. This is 1335 days after the abomination of desolation. Pinpointing the Start of World War 3 by Roy A. Reinhold This article will challenge your understanding of prophecy, do you have the courage to face the truth? One of the most misunderstood facets of prophecy study is the question, \"When does world war 3 begin according to the scriptures?\" Tons of books have been written proposing that WW3 starts after the rapture and before the beginning of the end-times 7 year period, or proposed that WW3 begins sometime during the first 3.5 years in the Tribulation period, or begins near the end of the 7 year period in a war which ends at Armageddon. All of these \"theories\" are incorrect and the correct beginning of world war 3 can be shown to begin immediately after the middle of the end-times 7 year period, right after the abomination of desolation takes place. When I say proved conclusively, I mean without a doubt, without any equivocation! I will conclusively prove the point in this article, but let me first lay out what the scenario looks like which will make it easier for you to grasp the points. In the middle of the end-times 7 year period, the antichrist will sit down in the most holy place of the soon to be built Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, and declare falsely that he is God. This is called throughout scriptures, the abomination of desolation. It is also called the beginning of the Great Tribulation period. Almost immediately after the abomination of desolation, Egypt will lead an alliance of Arab nations in attacking Israel to achieve their long-time objective of ridding the Middle East of Jews and creating a Palestinian nation in what is now Israel. In the Arab alliance with Egypt are Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Jordan, all the nations which surround Israel. Actually, the scriptures tell us that Jordan will attempt to remain neutral, but will enter the war as Israelis flee the invading armies and try to cross the Jordan River and also a route south of the Dead Sea. The Jordanians attack the fleeing Jewish refugees. Egypt and her Arab allies are called the King of the South in Daniel 11:40, and they will start the war because they have an ironclad treaty with Russia to join in the war once Egypt starts it. Russia and her allies are called the King of the North. This powerful coalition will have a single purpose in mind, to forever eliminate the Jewish problem. World War 3 will not last a long time in duration, but will be the most deadly conflict ever, with nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons used by both sides. On the side of Israel will be the European Community, the United States, other NATO countries, Japan, and China. Tens of millions will be killed with this unprecedented use of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. Japan and China will enter the war only after the US has been attacked in a surprise all-out nuclear attack from Russia. Unlike the Desert Storm war of 1991, the coalition forces will not stop their attack until all the nations which attacked Israel are completely overrun. Forces from China and Japan will go all the way to the very western borders of Russia. World War 3 ends with total victory at a very high price to the combatants involved. However, scripture shows us that the war will end during the Great Tribulation period, before the time of the 6th Seal events of Revelation 6:12-14. At the time of the 6th Seal events, the rapture of believers takes place and then the wrath of God period begins, called the Day of the Lord. During the Day of the Lord the 7 Trumpet Judgments and 7 Bowl Judgments occur. The"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Armageddon war starts just before the return of Jesus as conquering Messiah, as the nations revolt against the incredibly strict dictatorship economic control by the antichrist. Now, let me prove conclusively to you, that World War 3 starts immediately after the abomination of desolation in the middle of the end-times 7 year period! In both the Matthew 24 and Mark 13 versions of the Olivet Discourse, Jesus told Peter, James, John, and Andrew the events that would take place just before He returned to take over rule and reign of the whole earth. In that discourse, He revealed that something very important was to take place right after the abomination of desolation. Mark 13:14-20 But when you see the ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION standing where it should not be (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. And let him who is on the housetop not go down, or enter in, to get anything out of his house; and let him who is in the field not turn back to get his cloak. But woe to those who are with child and to those who nurse babes in those days! But pray that it may not happen in the winter. For those days will be a time of tribulation such as has not occurred since the beginning of creation which God created, until now, and never shall. And unless the Lord had shortened those days, no life would have been saved; but for the sake of the elect whom He chose, He shortened the days. That same corresponding text is Matthew 24:15-22, where that future period is called the Great Tribulation as opposed to the first half of the 7 year period which is called the Tribulation period. I know, you've read the above text and probably are saying that no world war is mentioned. I've started off with the obscure texts first, but you'll soon see that Jesus was obliquely referring to the coming world war 3 timeframe. The reason that Jesus said for those in Judea (modern Israel) to flee when the abomination of desolation takes place, is that there will quickly be an all-out attack upon Israel with armies many times the size of Israel's entire population. Our next text is in the Luke 21 version of the Olivet Discourse, where a few more details are mentioned. Luke 21:20-24 But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then recognize that her desolation is at hand. Then let those in Judea flee to the mountains, and let those who are in the midst of the city depart, and let not those who are in the country enter the city; because these are the days of vengeance, in order that all things which are written may be fulfilled. Woe to those who nurse babes in those days; for there will be great distress upon the land, and wrath to this people, and they will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led captive into all the nations; and Jerusalem will be trampled underfoot by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled. Many have interpreted the Luke passage above as applying to the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 AD, but the truth is that there is a future fulfillment. The disciples had asked two questions of Jesus, (1) when will the Temple be destroyed, and (2) what will be the signs when His return was about to take place? Jesus' answer took in the destruction of the Temple in 70 AD, but the whole context is about events that will take place just before He returns to set up the kingdom of God on the earth. Notice that the same language is used in the Matthew, Mark, and Luke versions, where people in Judea are told to flee for the mountains, and woe to those who are pregnant or nursing babies. No one will argue that the text in Matthew and Mark are exclusively about the end-times 7 year period, but they argue about the text in Luke even though it uses the same language. Perhaps they are arguing to fit the scripture into their pre-conceived notions! Another thought concerns the phrase, \"all things which are written may be fulfilled.\" We know that all prophecy will be fulfilled before the Messiah returns to reign on the earth, but who would apply that understanding to the destruction of the Temple in 70 AD? Obviously no one would reach that"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"conclusion. Now that we've hit the more obscure references, let's go on to the clear unarguable texts which prove the point. In Daniel 11:36-38, we are shown that the antichrist will falsely declare himself to be God, and will not honor any of the gods of the various religions. Then we are shown the attack which commences world war 3, after the text about the abomination of desolation! Daniel 11:40 And at the end time the king of the South will collide with him, and the king of the North will storm against him with chariots, with horsemen, and with many ships; and he will enter countries, overflow them, and pass through. No one will argue that this scripture text is about world war 3, but many argue that Daniel 11:36-38 may not be talking about the abomination of desolation. Take a look at how the angel explained the events to Daniel. Daniel 12:11 And from the time that the regular sacrifice is abolished, and the abomination of desolation is set up, there will be 1290 days. The angel was referring back to the verses in Daniel 11:36-38, where a more explanatory version of the abomination of desolation was given. We know that the antichrist will stop the regular sacrifices in the soon to be built Jewish Temple, and perform the abomination of desolation. Clearly then, the start of world war 3 begins in Daniel 11:40, after the abomination of desolation. The next example is the clearest in scripture, where the entire book of Joel is about the Great Tribulation periodand details the invasion of the king of the North into Israel. The identifying texts show that the book of Joel events occur after the sacrifices in the Jewish Temple are stopped (at the time of the abomination of desolation). Joel 1:6 For a nation has invaded my land,.... Joel 1:9 The grain offering and the libation are cut off from the house of the Lord. The priests mourn, the ministers of the Lord. Joel 1:14 Gird yourselves with sackcloth, and lament O priests; wail O ministers of the altar! Come, spend the night in sackcloth, O ministers of my God, for the grain offering and the libation are withheld from the house of your God. Joel 1:15 Alas for the day! For the Day of the Lord is near, and it will come as destruction from the Almighty. Joel 2:1 Blow a trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm on My holy mountain! Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble, for the Day of the Lord is coming; surely it is near. Joel 2:20 But I will remove the northern army far from you,.... Joel 2:31 The sun will be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and awesome Day of the Lord comes . Joel 3:14-15 ... For the Day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision. The sun and the moon grow dark, and the stars lose their brightness. Instead of splitting apart the concepts, I gave them all to you at once. The texts from Joel state that the time context is after the sacrifices in the Temple have been stopped. We know from other texts such as Daniel 12:11, that the antichrist will stop the sacrifices in the Temple and perform the abomination of desolation. So, the time frame in the book of Joel is after the sacrifices are stopped and before the Day of the Lord begins. Notice in Joel 1:15"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"above, that the timing is when the Day of the Lord is near, but hasn't come. Joel 2:1, likewise says that the timing is before the Day of the Lord. Another concept from the text above is that an army has invaded the nation of Israel (Joel 1:6), and that army is the northern army(Joel 2:20). The northern army is the king of the North from Daniel 11:40. Therefore, the scriptural texts confirm the scenario outlined at the beginning of this article, that world war 3 begins during the Great Tribulation period, before the Day of the Lord period. Another concept from the texts above is that the Day of the Lord period begins after the 6th Seal signs of Revelation 6:12-14, where the sun becomes black like sackcloth, and the moon became like blood. Notice that Joel 2:31 and Joel 3:14-15 both refer to the sun and moon becoming dark, and are the 6th Seal signs of Revelation 6. What is so significant, is that Joel 2:31 states that the 6th Seal signs occur before the Day of the Lord comes. The text from Joel 3:14-15, also states that when the 6th Seal signs occur, the Day of the Lord is near. Are there other scriptures that say the same thing? Take a look at the book of Matthew. Matthew 24:29 But immediately after the tribulation of those days THE SUN WILL BE DARKENED, AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT, AND THE STARS WILL FALL from the sky, and the POWERS OF THE HEAVENS will be shaken,.... or, take a look at the book of Mark. Mark 13:24 But in those days, after that tribulation, THE SUN WILL BE DARKENED, AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT, AND THE STARS WILL BE FALLING from heaven, and the POWERS THAT ARE IN THE HEAVENS will be shaken. How clear do you want it? Without a doubt, the period up to the 6th Seal signs are called the tribulation of those days (made up of the Tribulation and Great Tribulation periods). We have two witnesses that state that immediately after the tribulation of those days the 6th Seal signs take place, and the two texts from the book of Joel that clearly state that the 6th Seal signs take place before the Day of the Lord begins! If you read the book of Joel, you'll clearly see that the invasion of the northern army into Israel is over before the 6th Seal signs and before the Day of the Lord begins. If hardheaded, you might ask, \"Roy, are there more scriptures that confirm the same things?\" Yeah, sure, take a look at Ezekiel 30, with verses 1-9 about that same time period before the Day of the Lord begins. Ezekiel 30:3-5 For the Day of the Lord is near; it will be a day of clouds, a time of doom for the nations. And a sword will come upon Egypt, and anguish will be in Ethiopia when the slain fall in Egypt, they take away her wealth, and her foundations are torn down. Ethiopia, Put, Lud, all Arabia, Libya, and the people of the land that is in league will fall with them by the sword. God our Father has placed clues like this throughout scripture, where it states that the Day of the Lord is near. That phrase sets the time frame for the prophecy. Notice that it talks of the same nations mentioned in Daniel 11, Ezekiel 38 & 39, and others. Put and Lud above add the names of modern day Sudan and Tunisia, and perhaps Algeria. It takes no great leap of knowledge that calculate that in an all-out attack on Israel to eliminate them once and for all, that all the Arab nations will want to participate. But Roy, are there other texts which point to the same time frame you've mentioned? Take a look at Ezekiel 32, which ties in the 6th Seal signs as occurring after Egypt is destroyed, and also tells us who decimates Egypt. Ezekiel 32:2 Son of man, take up a lamentation over Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say to him,...."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Ezekiel 32:7 And when I extinguish you, I will cover the heavens, and darken their stars; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give its light. Ezekiel 32:11 For thus says the Lord God, \"The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon you.\" As in the Daniel 11:40 text, the above scripture is about the king of the South, Egypt. The time frame of the chapter is identified by the 6th Seal signs in Ezekiel 32:7, as the sun and the moon become dark. The alliance headed by the antichrist, the king of Babylon, will decimate the land of Egypt for their attack on the nation of Israel. Ezekiel 32 goes on to cite the other nations which are decimated along with Israel. Ezekiel 32:22 Assyria.... (Syria) Ezekiel 32:24 Elam.... (Iraq) Ezekiel 32:26 Meshech and Tubal.... (Russia) Ezekiel 32:29 There also is Edom.... (Jordan) Ezekiel 32:30 There also are the chiefs of the north (Islamic countries of former Soviet Union like Kazakhstan, etc.), all of them, and all the Sidonians.... (Lebanon) Other reference texts concerning our topic of world war 3 occurring in the Great Tribulation period are Isaiah 13, which discusses a war when the Day of the Lord is near. The book of Obadiah is entirely about the war during the Great Tribulation period, when the Day of the Lord is near. Obadiah details the actions which Edom (modern Jordan) takes against the fleeing Israelis, who attempt to cross the Jordan River and south of the Dead Sea route when the Arab and Russian armies overrun Israel. The scriptural references provide overwhelming evidence for the outlined scenario. It takes courage to face the truth that your previous understanding of prophecy is flawed. Do you have the courage to accept the truth and change? God our Father will give you the understanding if you ask Him. Antichrist, The Beast to Come: part 1 by Roy A. Reinhold Seeking to plumb the unknown without direct revelation from God, many Christians have published wild-eyed speculations concerning the Antichrist; who he is or might be, and fictional writings of what he might do in their day and time. These fanciful speculations about the antichrist have been pandered about since the early days of the church, in the 2nd century AD. I prefer to believe the writings of Irenaeus on the subject, who was Bishop of the church in Asia Minor, and a longtime disciple of the noted Bishop of the church, Polycarp. Polycarp was a longtime disciple of the Apostle John and was taught directly by a number of other of the twelve apostles. Irenaeus then, was one of the last to be taught all aspects of the faith by those who learned at the feet of the twelve apostles of Jesus. In his treatise, Against Heresies, Irenaeus wrote that the teaching of the apostles was that the exact name of the antichrist is a secret kept by God until the man of sin arrives on the earth. Also taught was the statement that the antichrist is not worthy to be heralded ahead of time, but only when we must know it. The conclusion is that God will reveal the name and person of the antichrist to the church through corroborated prophecy, dreams, and"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"visions, only when the antichrist is about to step onto the world platform for the last act in the play of good versus evil. Let me begin with a more basic explanation of the antichrist, since many likely to read this article may not have even the foggiest notion of who or what an antichrist is supposed to be. The antichrist is called the beast in some texts, the man of sin, the little horn, the son of perdition, the king of Babylon, and the antichrist. He is a man who will be given authority to act in the earth for 1260 days or 42 months or 3.5 years. His initial confirming revealing takes place at the soon to be built Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, in the exact middle of the end-times 7 year period, when he sits down in the most holy place of the Temple and falsely declares to the entire world that he is God. We know he will deceive the whole world with great charisma, charm, and deceiving miracles, and will demand worship. After he heads the coalition of nations which defeats the northern armies, which invade Israel right after the abomination of desolation in the Temple, he will establish a short reign of unprecedented economic power over the entire world. At the end of his allotted time of authority, he will be crushed by the power of Messiah and the angels, and thrown into the lake of fire forever and ever. The book of Daniel reveals many aspects of the antichrist to come. Daniel 7:7-8 After this I kept looking in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, dreadful and terrifying and extremely strong; and it had large iron teeth. It devoured and crushed, and trampled down the remainder with its feet; and it was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns. While I was contemplating the horns, behold, another horn, a little one, came up among them, and three of the first horns were pulled out by the roots before it; and behold, this horn possessed eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth uttering great boasts. This text above follows the description of three previous beasts which Daniel witnessed. The first beast was like a lion and had the wings of an eagle; this beast represents the Babylonian empire of Nebuchadnezzar. The second beast resembled a bear; this beast represents the Medo-Persian empire which later overthrew the Babylonian empire. The third beast was like a leopard with four wings and four heads; this beast represents the Greek empire of Alexander the Great which overthrew the Medo-Persian empire and broke into four parts after his death. The fourth beast in our text above represents the Roman empire which overthrew all parts of the Greek empire. From this and a number of other texts, we know that the antichrist, the little horn, comes out of a revived Roman empire. It's likely that the current frenzy to make Europe into one nation through the Maastricht treaty process will be the fulfillment of the expected revived Roman empire. Notice that the little horn represents a man, and three of the first ten horns were pulled out before the little horn. The ten horns represent a coalition of 10 leaders in the revived Roman empire, and the antichrist will be known by his taking over three of the ten countries. Daniel was given an explanation of the vision by an angel in the last part of chapter 7."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Daniel 7:23-27 Thus he said: \"The fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom on the earth, which will be different from all the other kingdoms, and it will devour the whole earth and tread it down and crush it. As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings will arise; and another will arise after them, and he will be different from the previous ones and will subdue three kings. And he will speak out against the Most High and wear down the saints of the Highest One, and he will intend to make alterations in times and in law; and they will be given into his hand for a time, times, and half a time. But the court will sit for judgment, and his dominion will be taken away, annihilated and destroyed forever. Then the sovereignty, the dominion, and the greatness of all the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be given to the people of the saints of the Highest One; His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all the dominions will serve and obey Him. A time, times, and half a time means a time (one year), a times (2 years), and half a time (one-half a year). We know this is true because Revelation 12:6 says 1260 days, and Revelation 13:5 says that the time of authority allotted to the antichrist is 42 months. All of these are equal lengths of time and speak about the same things. Notice that the angel said that the 10 kings would arise before the little horn arises and he is different from those ten. Therefore if we are right about the European Community developing into the Revived Roman empire of prophecy, we ought to recognize that the antichrist will not be one of the 10 initial leaders. He will gain power after the 10 are already in power for a while, and will subdue 3 kings or countries. This may occur before the abomination of desolation and may itself be the certain identifier of the antichrist. Another bit of truth concerning the antichrist is revealed in the text above, namely, that he will intend to make alterations in times and law, and this will fall under his authority for 42 months. In Revelation 13, we are told that the antichrist will institute the mark of the beast system, where no one will be able to buy or sell unless they have the mark. So we know that the antichrist will have economic control, and control of the law and courts. Sounds like the ultimate dictator to me. Jumping over to chapter 11 in the book of Daniel, we are given further information about the antichrist. The first part of chapter 11 is prophecy that has already been fulfilled, up to verse 32, with verses 33-35 providing a transition through recorded history to the end-times period. What follows verse 35 is of great interest to us. Daniel 11:36-39 Then the king will do as he pleases, and he will exalt and magnify himself above every god, and will speak monstrous things against the God of gods; and he will prosper until the indignation is finished, for that which is decreed will be done. And he will show no regard for the gods of his fathers or for the desire of women, nor will he show regard for any other god; but he will magnify himself above them all. But instead he will honor a god of fortresses, a god whom his fathers"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"did not know; he will honor him with gold, silver, costly stones and treasures. And he will take action against the strongest of fortresses with the help of a foreign god; he will give great honor to those who acknowledge him, and he will cause them to rule over the many, and will parcel out land for a price. The antichrist will magnify himself above all gods by falsely declaring himself to be God at the rebuilt Jewish Temple in Jerusalem in the middle of the end-times 7 year period. We call this the abomination of desolation. Notice that many have tried to say that the antichrist will be a homosexual, because the verse says he will show no regard for the desire of women, from the text above. Taking things out of context, they forget that the subject of the sentence is that the antichrist will show no regard for any gods, but magnify himself above them all. Actually, the sentence means that the antichrist will show no regard for the matriarchal religion passed down from ancient Babylon, where many women have worshipped a false queen of heaven under many names such as Diana, Astarte, Mother Earth, Ishtar, Eostre, etc. In our study of the antichrist, the last part of the text above is very revealing. Like many politicians today, he will help those who help him, he will put in power over countries and regions those who worship him as god, and he will fatten his coffers by selling land that he has wrongfully seized for bribes and quote \"contributions.\" Going on. Daniel 11:40-45 And at the end time the king of the South will collide with him, and the king of the North will storm against him with chariots, with horsemen, and with many ships; and he will enter many countries, overflow them, and pass through. He will also enter the Beautiful Land, and many countries will fall; but these will be rescued out of his hand: Edom, Moab, and the foremost of the sons of Ammon. Then he will stretch out his hand against other countries, and the land of Egypt will not escape. But he will gain control over the hidden treasures of gold and silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt; and Libyans and Ethiopians will follow at his heels. But rumors from the East and from the North will disturb him, and he will go forth with great wrath to destroy and annihilate many. And he will pitch the tents of his royal pavilion between the seas and the beautiful Holy Mountain; yet he will come to his end, and no one will help him. The text states what will happen in the middle of the 7 year end-times period, right after the abomination of desolation in the Temple. The king of the South (Egypt) leads an Arab coalition which starts world war 3. They will attack Israel where the antichrist is at, from the southwest, from the Mediterranean on the west, from the north through Lebanon, and from the northeast over the Golan Heights. Egypt leads the start of this war which quickly will escalate into world war 3, but Egypt goes into the war knowing that the Russian-led coalition (king of the North) has given them firm assurances of joining the war. You can read the articles on world war 3 for the proofs, but WW3 will not be a long-lasting war, however, it will be brutal with the use of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons used. Edom, Moab, and Ammon all comprise present day Jordan, which will attempt neutrality"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"during the war by letting coalition forces from both sides pass through their territory. It is this victory in world war 3 which will allow the antichrist to grasp firm control over the entire world as people say, give us peace and safety and we will do anything, even declare that you are god. Ezekiel 32 is about the combatants in world war 3, and calls the antichrist the king of Babylon. Ezekiel 32:7-8 \"And when I extinguish you (Egypt), I will cover the heavens, and darken their stars; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give its light. All the shining lights in the heavens I will darken over you and will set darkness in your land,\" declares the Lord God. This verse sets the time of the prophecies in chapter 32; these are the 6th Seal signs of Revelation 6. Revelation 6:12-13 And I looked when He broke the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth made of hair, and the whole moon became like blood; and the stars of the sky fell to the earth, as a fig tree casts its unripe figs when shaken by a great wind. The 6th Seal signs are signposts scattered throughout scripture to identify the time frame of many prophetic passages. The sixth seal signs happen at the end of the Great Tribulation period, before the start of the Day of the Lord. What we know from many prophetic passages, is that world war 3 will be over long before the end of the Great Tribulation period, it really will not last for a great length of time. Jumping back to Ezekiel 32, we see who fights against Egypt. Ezekiel 32:11-12 For thus says the Lord God, \"The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon you. By the swords of the mighty ones I will cause your multitude to fall; all of them are tyrants of the nations, and they shall devastate Egypt, and all its multitude shall be destroyed.\" The king of Babylon is the antichrist and just like in Daniel 11:40-43, where Egypt is called the king of the South, the nation of Egypt and their allies shall be destroyed by the antichrist-led coalition. Read the articles on world war 3 for many more details on the war. Jumping back to Daniel 12, there is a text there that is very clear, but almost always avoided by many who have taught prophecy (it doesn't fit their pre-conceived notions). Daniel 12:10-12 Many will be purged, purified and refined; but the wicked will act wickedly, and none of the wicked will understand, but those who have insight will understand. And from the time that the regular sacrifice is abolished, and the abomination of desolation is set up, there will be 1290 days. How blessed is he who keeps waiting and attains to the 1335 days."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"This passage refers to the antichrist abolishing the daily sacrifices in the soon to be built Jewish Temple in Jerusalem and performing the abomination of desolation, where he falsely declares that he is God. That is the start of the Great Tribulation period. The 1290 days, from the abomination of desolation, is the timing of Jesus' return as conquering Messiah, when He will take control over all the nations of the earth. The 1335 days from the abomination of desolation is the fulfillment of the prophetic plan on Yom Kippur, when Israel is judged and their sins forgiven. The house of Judah and the house of Israel will be made into one nation again and Messiah will spread the Tabernacle of peace over the whole earth. Nations will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks, and nations will not learn war anymore! What about the discrepancy between the 1260 days of authority given to the antichrist and the 1290 days when Jesus returns? Antichrist's authority is removed at the end of 1260 days, he will still be here on earth for a short while, but his empire will be badly crumbling. Coincidentally, the 1260 days of authority for the antichrist ends when the 1260 days of the ministry of the two witnesses ends and they are taken up into heaven. There is much more to be learned about the days of the antichrist; to be covered in part 2. "}]
