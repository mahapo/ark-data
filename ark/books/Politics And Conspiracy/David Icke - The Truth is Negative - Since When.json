[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"To our New Visitors - David Icke THE IS NEGATIVE?SINCE WHEN?By David Icke I have heard it said that many articles on this site are too explicit and that we should let people know what is happening in a slower, more \"gentle\" way. That's a view and people have every right to express it. But, from where I am sitting, it is breathtaking self-indulgence. I hear people talk about facing their fears, taking their power back, and making a difference, but when the opportunity comes to do so, they want to run, mentally, emotionally, and even physically. The point is that we do not have limitless time to expose what is happening and every day that passes more and more children are suffering. Tell them we have to go more slowly and gently because we don't want to upset people. http://www.davidicke.com/icke/temp/truth.html (1 af 3) [03-03-2002 12:16:14]"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"To our New Visitors - David IckeIt is time, not just to wake up, but to grow up. Taking our power back means taking responsibility for what is going on, exposing it, facing it, and therefore changing it. I also hear it said that if we create our own reality, then no-one is to blame for what is going on. This, for me, is massively simplistic. Every thought is changing and affecting events. So whatever happens, everyone is responsible for it. Those who choose to carry out an action physically, those who arrange for it to happen, and those, the vast majority, who stand around and allow it to happen without question or response. What are we supposed to do, say those children are creating their own reality and so leave them to it? What does that say about our reality? This website and my books are exposing those who are physically involved in these horrors and the networks through which they operate. But it is also challenging the rest of us to take responsibility for this, too, because it can only happen if we allow it to happen by closing our minds or closing our eyes. Or saying: \"what can I do?\" as an excuse to convince ourselves that there is nothing we can do, therefore easing our conscience when we do nothing. There is talking spirituality and responsibilityand then there is LIVING it. http://www.davidicke.com/icke/temp/truth.html (2 af 3) [03-03-2002 12:16:14]"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"To our New Visitors - David IckeThe two are not the same and are constantly confused.
