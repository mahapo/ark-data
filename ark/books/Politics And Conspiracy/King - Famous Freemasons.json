The creator of this web site is acutely aware of the aphorism that a person who has a hammer views the whole world as a nail. However, if one compares the number of famous and good people who were Masons or members of the Masonic 'family' with the number of famous and good people who were against Masonry, there is simply no contest. Anti-Masons who've achieved positions of greatness and recognition can be counted on a few fingers. Compare the list of 'famous Anti-Masons' we've provided on another page with the famous Freemasons you'll find on our lists. If Masonry was evil, occultic, conspiratorial or bad, why would these men - and the many millions more whose names are not recorded here - voluntarily choose to affiliate with it over the past three hundred years? Find a Grave: Many Masons and members of the Masonic 'family' proudly display their affiliation with the fraternity at their final resting place. If you see this image , you can click on the Mason's name and be transported to the \" Find A Grave\" web site to see an actual picture of their grave located on the web. (There may be more than just those we've got noted here; gravestone pictures at that web site are being updated constantly.) You might also find our page about Masonic gravestones of interest.... Due to popular request, we now offer a printable version of this information (which includes the 'Black Sheep' and 'Infamous' pages) -- click here. You'll need the free Adobe Reader in order to be able to view/print this PDF file. Our lists are not the 'standard' ones seen on other Masonic websites. They are greatly augmented by additional material on the lives of these distinguished persons as well as by the listing of many Masons whose membership has been verified through news stories, personal knowledge, etc. Many of these names have been provided by others and we've set up a special page here to say \"thanks\" for their contributions. We also note an exceptionally well-designed site which shows many of the individual Masons we've named in 'categories'. Congratulations to New Jersey Masons website for their excellent presentation. Due to the HUGE size of this page and the frequency of visitors to it, we've finally been forced to divide it into sections. You can find our list divided alphabetically A-L here and M-Z here.

This page will provide the continuity to those other pages. Listings of those who are (or were during their lifetime) Masons serves to remind us of the many notables who - of their own free will - chose to associate with this noble institution. Those who preach anti-Masonic hate must ultimately wonder how it is that so many have been (supposedly) deceived - while they have found the 'truth'.... And while some will argue that these men have been deceived; others contend they are/were part of a New World Order conspiracy. What is not arguable is that they represent all walks of life and that they were - in their respective ways - LEADERS! Throughout the 300 years of Freemasonry in its current form, there have been a precious few who have not behaved in a way that reflects positively upon the organization. We talk about them on this page. Important Note: This listing is not all-inclusive nor is it an 'official' list of any sort. Information is derived from sources believed to be accurate. Any errors are solely the fault of the compiler! Names for this site have come from many sources. Please take a moment to see the list of contributors here. Please note, though, that we do not have unlimited space nor do we have unlimited time. We'd love to keep adding to this section but have found far too many submissions sent as: \"I think X is a Brother.\" or \"A fellow mentioned in Lodge the other night that X is a Mason.\". That simply isn't sufficient for our purposes. Accordingly, we're now curtailing efforts on these pages considerably and returning our focus to anti-Masonry. We believe that the many Masons shown clearly acknowledge that Freemasonry attracts members of the highest standing. And far beyond these few pages are the millions upon millions of those who joined and enjoyed the lessons they've learned from the friendship and fellowship of Freemasonry.

(That simple fact alone should say something to Masonry's antagonists! If a man achieves greatness, he's sometimes presumed to be a Mason; he is never presumed to be against Masonry!) In addition, there have been a few who were thought to be Masons simply because of their affiliation with other Masons. Below, we'll mention a few.... Neil Armstrong - American astronaut who as commander of Apollo 11 became the first human being to walk on the moon (July 20, 1969) has been cited by some as having been a Mason. It appears that the confusion may have resulted from the Masonic membership of his father. No one has been able to provide the name of the Lodge to which Armstrong might have belonged. David O. Norris, one of the authors of ' The Songs of Freemasonry' has indicated that when attempting to send a complimentary copy of their work to Armstrong, his assistant advised that he'd never been a Mason and returned the recording. Lord Robert Baden-Powell , Chief Scout of the World and Founder of the World Scout Movement is sometimes wrongly identified as a Freemason. No proof of this has ever been found and immediately after his death in 1941, his non-membership was confirmed by his widow, Lady Olave Baden-Powell, by his daughter Betty, by his brother Major David Baden-Powell (who was a Mason) and also by V. W. Bro. Lord Somers, who succeeded Baden-Powell at the head of the scout movement. The same confirmation of non-membership was made at the consecration of Baden-Powell Lodge #448, United Grand Lodge of Victoria, Australia. Also see \"Freemasonry and the Scout Movement\" by George W. Kerr, 1994. The myth seems to continue despite this, however, despite many attempts to debunk it. You can find one such discussion on this page of the pen-ultimate B-P web site. 1 Sir Francis Bacon (1561-1626) was an English philosopher and statesman, often referred to as the most influential and versatile writer of the 17th Century. He has been presumed by some to be the 'real' Shakespeare - and many have pointed to the connections between writings by Bacon and those of Shakespeare with that of Freemasonry. Realistically, the link between Shakespeare and Bacon has never been definitively proven nor was Freemasonry in its present form existent. Those who want to see links can find many 'connections' between the works of both Bacon and Shakespeare but such similarities are retrospective. The appearance of a square and - separately - what appears to be compasses on a book's frontspiece is held by some as \"proof\" that Bacon was a Mason; such ideas are, of course, impossible to prove at this time and it is doubtful that such a connection will ever be more than speculative conjecture. There are a number of books about this imagined connection.

Mason Harry Kellar, America's premier magician from 1887 to 1908 selected Mason Howard Thurston as his successor. Before his death in 1935, Bro. Thurston selected Dante as his successor. In turn, Mason 'Dante' (Harry Jansen) selected Lee Grabel (Mason Merill Lee Grabeel) who, similarly, selected Lance Burton in 1954 to continue this extraordinary tradition. Although Burton is not a Mason, he is donating the profit from a retail magic store next to the Lance Burton Theatre in the Monte Carlo Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, to the Shriners Hospitals for Children. 2 U. S. President George Herbert Walker Bush has also on numerous occasions been referred to as a Freemason. The confusion probably arises from the swearing in ceremonies at his inauguration when he took his oath of office on the George Washington Bible which belongs to St. Johns Lodge in New York City. Because the Bible belonged to a Masonic Lodge many writers assumed he was a Freemason. The Bible was used at the request of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies. This particular Bible was first used on April 30, 1789, by the Grand Master of the Masons in New York, to administer the oath of office to President George Washington in New York City. Other presidents who took their oath of office with this Bible were Warren G. Harding, Dwight D. Eisenhower and Jimmy Carter. U. S. President George Walker Bush , son of President George H. W. Bush is not presently rumored to be a Mason. He had wished to take his Oath of Office on the same Bible as used by his father when he became President but the inclement weather was such that the custodians of the Bible from St. Johns Lodge #1 in New York concurred with President-elect Bush just moments before the ceremony that it would have placed the priceless treasure at too great a risk. Accordingly, a family Bible was used instead. Anti- Mason Ed Decker brags that God answered his prayers that President Bush not take his oath on the Washington Bible.... Famous Hollywood movie director James Cameron has been 'linked' by some anti- Masonic conspiracy-minded folks as having received the 33rd Degree of the Scottish Rite in some sort of secret ceremony during an Oscar Award presentation. Their claims, of course, totally ignore the fact that 'secret presentations' of that honor simply do not occur. All recipients of the award are announced publicly at the annual Scottish Rite meeting the year before the award is actually presented. The presentation is done at the next annual meeting. Since printed proceedings of both Annual Sessions are sent to thousands of Masonic bodies throughout the world, a simple review of them would clearly show no such presentation. In fact (perhaps ironically?) the Supreme Council in March, 2000 advised that there is not even a member within their organization named \"James Cameron\". An additional check has been made with the General Secretary of the Oakland Scottish Rite Bodies who also advised that James Cameron is not now and has never been a member of the Oakland Scottish Rite Bodies. The next time you see such information, ask the claimant to produce evidence that James Cameron is a Scottish Rite Mason.

(1887-1975) Charlie Chaplain was not a Mason despite the fact that stories circulate from time to time that he was. The stories are untrue. Former U. S. President Bill Clinton is not a Mason. He was a member of the Order of DeMolay, a youth group sponsored by Masons and during his membership was the presiding officer (Master Councilor) of his Chapter. Membership in DeMolay often leads a young man to seek Masonic membership but such membership is no guarantee of election as a Mason and in light of the many 'scandals' surrounding his presidency, it would probably be impossible for him. Mr. Clinton - during his presidency - maintained a level of popularity with the citizens of the United States and the world which was unprecedented in modern history. However, after due consideration, the awards given to President Clinton during his teenage years as well as the honor of being included on the DeMolay Hall of Fame given when he was the country's youngest Governor have been rescinded! (So as to ensure an even-handedness in this, we've also listed the former President on our Infamous Non- Masons page!) Walt Disney - World famous cartoonist, Walt was a DeMolay (a fraternal organization for young men sponsored by Freemasonry). He did not, however, join the Masonic organization. Rumors circulate continuously about this and some have proven quite tantalizing. No one, however, has been able to produce the name of a lodge to which Walt might have belonged. Lt. General Nathan Bedford Forrest , one of the Confederacy's most daring and effective cavalry commanders during the US Civil War began his military service as a private and rose to command cavalry troops throughout the South during that horrific time. General Forrest founded the ORIGINAL Ku Klux Klan which began as a prankish social organization whose activities were soon directed against the leaders of the Reconstructionist government, both black and white. The organization quickly grew out of hand, being abused by wild youth attempting to use it for purposes of looting and pillage. Forrest disbanded the group and it ultimately died. It was later 'resurrected' by those seeking to use it for hatred and racism in the 1920s, well after Forrest's death in 1877. Forrest took ONE of THREE degrees of Freemasonry and never returned to the Lodge. Under the rules of the Grand Lodge of Tennessee, he would not have been considered a Mason. The attempt to link him to Freemasonry is made by those who want association of the current racist organization to the fraternity. Such attempts ignore history and facts in their entirety.

Graham is frequently identified as a Mason by religious intolerants whose ideology is different from his. They feel, apparently, that connecting him with Freemasonry will smear his outstanding abilities and his life-long commitment to his faith. In the earliest days of the world wide web (we seem to recall it was about 1994), a listing of famous Freemasons appeared on the web site of the Grand Lodge of Louisiana, USA. Dr. Graham's name appeared on the list in error based on an assumption by the person who prepared it. (No, it isn't a conspiracy to hide anything! In fact, it's likely that the information may have come from the book by former Mason Jim Shaw who lied that he had received the 33rd Degree of the Scottish Rite with Rev. Graham in attendance. Since Shaw never received the degree.... Read about it here!) Since that time, though, unsubstantiated claims have flown about on the internet and one of the most frequent questions we receive dealing with specific individuals concerns Dr. Graham. The simple fact - as substantiated by his organization - is that he is FAR too involved with his ministry to devote time to any other organization. We're sure that Rev. Graham would love to have the time to immerse himself in fund raising for a cure for cancer or helping the elderly but his calling gives him precious little time for anything else. Like other recognizable leaders who are not Masons, Dr. Graham has from time to time been present at Masonic or Masonic-family events. To assume he is a Mason because of a web site error or a person's attendance at a fund raising activity is presumptuous at best. Regretfully, most of those who insist that Rev. Graham is a Mason are those who want to smear both him and the fraternity. Bob Hope the American comedian and film actor, noted for his unflagging devotion to entertaining American military troops overseas for over 50 years sometimes appears on lists of Famous Masons. Bro. Gani Hernandez, Jr. has confirmed with the Masonic Service Bureau of Los Angeles in July, 2000 that Mr. Hope is not a Mason. U. S. President Thomas Jefferson was, at several points during the past two hundred years, identified as a Mason. Jefferson was involved in Revolutionary matters with many who were Masons and the appearance of the Jefferson name in Lodge record books of the time gave credence to the assumption. Recent research, however, reveals that Jefferson was simply not a Mason and that the Jefferson names appearing in the various lodge's visitor registers were, in fact, other men. U.S. President Lyndon Johnson received his first degree on October 30, 1937. After receiving the degree he found that his congressional duties (he was elected to Congress in 1937) took so much time he was unable to pursue the Masonic degrees. U. S. President Abraham Lincoln was not a Freemason. He applied for membership in Tyrian Lodge, Springfield, Illinois shortly after his nomination for the presidency in 1860. However, he withdrew his application because he felt that his application for membership at that time might be interpreted as a political tactic to obtain additional votes. He advised the lodge that he would resubmit his application again when he returned from his service file:///C|/Webs/Antimasonry2/famousnon.htm (4 of 7) [7/3/02 2:06:53 PM]"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Famous Non-Masons as president. Lincoln, as we know, never returned. On the death of the President, Tyrian Lodge adopted, on April 17, 1865, a resolution to say \"...that the decision of President Lincoln to postpone his application for the honors of Freemasonry, lest his motives be misconstrued, is the highest degree honorable to his memory.\" U. S. Revolutionary Thomas Paine who arrived in the Colonies in 1774 and whose fiery pen was said to ignite the Revolution and help shape the country we know today is sometimes thought to be a Mason, presumably because of his affiliations with Benjamin Franklin and Nicolas deBonneville. Paine was the author of Common Sense and was known for quotes such as \"These are the times that try men's souls.\" and subsequent US leaders have praised him extensively but he is commonly cited by anti-Masons as an example of the evils of Freemasonry due to his anti-Christian stance. Those who take this tact ignore two salient points: the first was that Paine - although writing strongly against the Christianity of the day - never denied God! From Paine's perspective, he was against the churches which presumed to speak for God without authority but he never denied the existence of God. The second point ignored was that there is no evidence whatsoever to support the claim that Paine was a Mason. He himself never made such a claim and there is no record of his attendance at lodges in or near the areas where he lived and/or traveled during his lifetime. There is no evidence that Charles Taze Russell , the founder of the Jehovah's Witnesses faith, was a Mason. Some have charged that his tombstone appears as a keystone (a symbol used in Royal Arch Masonry), that there appears on the stone a crown and cross and that the stone is in the shape of a pyramid. (Those who make the claim do so for their own ends ignoring the fact that the cross and crown have long been symbols of Christianity, that the pyramid is often used in one- dimension view to represent the Trinity etc.) A review of Russell's personal life would have likely found him unwelcome within a Lodge. A current author says of him \"Russell's faults as a writer were perhaps the least of his shortcomings. Accusations of sexual and financial improprieties, for example, dogged him throughout his adult life. Russell's notorious difficulties with his long-suffering wife Maria, aired during a series of sensational libel, separation, and alimony suits near the turn of the century, became a particular source of embarrassment for both the pastor and his flock. (Russell's stature couldn't have been enhanced when a Pennsylvania judge concluded that his \"continual arrogant domination\" of his wife was enough to \"render the life of any sensitive Christian woman a burden and make her life intolerable.\" 3 This notwithstanding, Pastor Russell did, upon occasion, make reference to Masons.

Those attempting to condemn Russell based on Masonic membership fail to produce any credible evidence of his membership and his supporters use faulty logic in arguing against it. Russell is not mentioned in any Masonic reference works, a unique situation indeed if he were a Mason based on his fame. Oh, and did we mention?: the \"tombstone\" that's so often referred to is actually a monument erected to Russell by the Watchtower Society which has regularly criticized Freemasonry. Pastor Russell's actual gravestone (shown above) is a couple of dozen yards away.... President Ronald Reagan has sometimes been referred to as a Freemason but he is not. Some confusion as to his membership arises from a ceremony held in the Oval Office of the White House on February 11, 1988, when a group of Freemasons presented President Reagan with a Certificate of Honor from the Grand Lodge of Washington, D.C. He was also then made an Honorary Scottish Rite Mason. However, since the title of Freemason can only be conferred by a Grand Lodge of Masons, President Reagan should only be referred to as a Shriner (he is also an Honorary Member of the Imperial Shrine due to his extensive work with that organization over the years) or as an Honorary Scottish Rite Mason. The Shrine and Scottish Rite are concordant bodies and cannot confer the title 'Freemason' on any person. Santa Anna - Mexican army general and President. We have more about him here. Shah of Iran (Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi) - a long-time friend to the US and its allies, he was forced to leave his country when it was taken over by Muslim fundamentalists under the regime of Ayatollah Khomeini. In some quarters, he is presumed to be a Mason. However according to a Mason in Washington DC, his late ex- Imperial Majesty (HIM), the King of Kings and the Light of the Aryans, would NEVER deign to even be made a Freemason at sight, let alone go through all the ritual. This Mason writes \"However, the younger of his two sons from his 3rd wife is a Freemason. Few exiled Freemasons from Iran know, or will confess, that a bunch of bootlickers among them (in order not to render the then ruling Shah further paranoid about the Freemasons and their supposed ties to the over-feared British) decided to have HIM personally pick the Grand Master (GM) of the Grand Lodge of Iran (GLI). The Shah picked one of his cronies and the crony remained GM until the revolution, when he fled Iran and left a whole bunch of GLI documents behind in his home which were easily discovered by the Ayatollah's men and formed the blacklist of Freemasons. This GM died last year in Manhattan after 19 years in exile and not one peep about GLI.

Meridith Wilson whose '76 Trombones' was one of my 'signature songs' as a budding high school musician (there was also 'Sentimental Journey' and 'Canadian Sunset', both great for romance, but I digress!) has been regularly identified on the web as being a Mason.

It is a rare individual who has not done something which embarrasses him and/or others. Masons are no different. Whether it's a burst of anger or some behavior which others see and remember, it's a part of being human. Regretfully, none of us have the ability to 'take back' what has happened. There have been a couple of well-publicized 'incidents' involving Masons - and we're not going to hide them under a rug. While they'll ignore the scandals of various 'religious leaders' such as Jimmy Swaggart, Jim Bakker and Oral Roberts, certain anti-Masons will cast aspersions on Masons whose conduct has been unbecoming, inappropriate, or downright bad! Here are those most commonly mentioned: The 'traitor', Benedict Arnold , is one of those whom anti- Masons use to show the 'evil deeds' of Freemasonry. They ignore the fact that Arnold was among those patriots of the American Revolution who were whipsawed back and forth by political intrigue and infighting causing him to be both hurt and resentful at the manner in which he was treated. At times a hero and at times totally shunned, Arnold ultimately decided that the 'cause' for which American patriots were fighting was wrong and he defected to the side of the British. In so doing, he actually became a hero for his military actions in Canada. His later life was filled with problems and - in retrospect - Brother Arnold 'did the wrong thing'. His military actions, however, were executed in a way as to save many lives and it is because \"victors write history\" that he is now regarded as an arch-villain by Americans. In Canada and the UK, Arnold's stature is far different than in the United States. We would recommend for your reading \"Benedict Arnold: Patriot and Traitor\" by Willard Sterne Randall (1990, William Morrow & Company, Inc., NY).

The story is often repeated as to how he supposedly would sit in the dugout filing his cleats and pointing with them at opposing players in order to intimidate and gain an advantage. Like many of his contemporaries, he reportedly had racist tendencies as well. Despite this, he was the very first player elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, so it's difficult for a conclusion to be drawn regarding this. Playing at a time when there were few rules, his behavior may seem horrific to us only in retrospect since it appears he was well received by those of his own time. We note here, however, the dissention which surrounds any laudatory comments made about Brother Cobb after whom a Scottish Rite Class was named in 1955 and who received an honorary life membership in a Masonic lodge in the midst of his playing career (1921). Brother Cobb, whose father was also a Mason, joined Freemasonry in 1907 at the age of 21. Henry Ford invented the automobile which changed the world. For the first two-thirds of his life, he achieved amazing things unequalled by men before or since. In the last third of his life, however, his behavior and activities cast a dark shadow which caused all of his former good to be questioned. Believing that bankers and financiers were part of a world-wide Jewish conspiracy (something many non- Masonic conspiracy theorists who are against Freemasonry believe today), Ford's thoughts and activities were nearly totally orchestrated by one of his lieutenants and it is thus difficult to know where his independent thoughts began and ended. Ford's erratic behavior is also said to have driven his son Edsel to the illnesses which caused his death. Put simply, his later life was not lived in accordance with Masonic principles. Found romping in a Washington fountain with stripper Fannie Fox, Arkansas' Congressman, Chairman of the influential Ways and Means Committee and Mason Wilbur Mills was 'run out of' the House of Representatives.

From the heights of power, Brother Mills fell - but he admitted his shortcomings and overcame them and was welcomed back to the Fraternity. George Wallace , a Mason, came to the nation's attention when he barred blacks integrating a high school. He was, after all, defending the laws of his state but emerging social conscience judged his actions wrong. A product of his times and his environment, Wallace did what he deemed appropriate: it was, however, wrong. Now anti-Masons point to Wallace as a (bad) example of Masonry. What they fail to acknowledge, however, is the constant pain and suffering Wallace endured after the assassination attempt AND the fact that he has subsequently apologized for his actions, an apology accepted by those involved! George Wallace was wrong but he certainly paid for his error in a way even the most cruel should not wish on anyone. The Winnipeg, Canada Shrine Motor Patrol hosted a \"gentlemen's dinner\" in late January, 2001. Approximately 400 were in attendance when the entertainment which included strippers who performed lap dances. Reports state \"live sex acts\" occurred. This is a disgusting and unsupportable action by anyone's standards. Since then, however, the unit has been disbanded and some of its members were ordered to take sensitivity training. Some anti-Masons - always willing to cast the first stone regardless of their own lives - have greatly enjoyed using this story as proof of the evils of Freemasonry. It is, however, a further example of how unrestrained 'fun' can lead to unexplainable excesses. Teenagers find themselves in bad situations frequently: these were adults who should have known better. While it is simple to explain that this was not a sanctioned Shrine event but rather a private fund-raiser for the Motor Patrol and that likely the majority of those in attendance were not Shriners, this horrid incident has nevertheless created a stain on the fraternity which will be impossible to erase. We could certainly compare and contrast the the frequent and persistent immoral behavior of various religious leaders but the fact remains: this was shameful! file:///C|/Webs/Antimasonry2/blksheep.htm (3 of 5) [7/3/02 2:07:34 PM]"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Our \"Black Sheep\" Contrast the above Masonic 'Black Sheep' with the following: Reverend Jim Jones - Caused hundreds of his followers to commit suicide in Guyana.

On this page, we'll debunk some of the myths. William Jefferson Clinton - the 42nd President of the United States, he was only the second President to be impeached, having been charged with perjury and obstruction of justice. Some argue that the act was one of political hatred while others point to provable and admitted egregious misdeeds. Mr. Clinton's career had many scandals which came to light in the bright glare of the Presidential spotlight. He has been disbarred from practicing law before the U. S. Supreme Court and lost his Arkansas law license for a period of five years. Mr. Clinton - despite the odd attempts by conspiracy-minded individuals to claim him as such - is not a Mason. We're written some other material about him here. Aleister Crowley - \"The Great Beast\" - Masonry's detractors make much of the supposed Masonic membership of this individual whose claims to immoral behavior are the antithesis of all that Freemasonry holds dear. Their charges are buttressed by a popular photograph of Crowley in regalia purporting to be a 33rd Degree Scottish Rite Mason. What's the truth? In these days of copyright protection, it's hard to understand how multiple groups could all claim the same name but such is the history surrounding Freemasonry as other organizations took its name and bastardized its concepts. Sometimes, regrettably, this occurred when someone who had previously been regularly made a Mason would decide - for whatever reason - that they could improve on things. Crowley joined a French Grand Lodge which was unrecognized by 'mainstream' Freemasonry and, in fact, was apparently quite miffed when he failed to be acknowledged as a Mason by those in London, his home at the time. Subsequently, he was 'given' a 33rd Scottish Rite degree while traveling in Mexico. Again, the organization which gave him that degree was a spurious one, totally unrecognized by other Scottish Rite Bodies throughout the world. In fact, as an interesting side note to history, Crowley's 33rd Degree had come from the same expelled Mason that began a thriving industry of duping people through the purchase of degrees by mail and which ultimately resulted in the successful prosecution of the very first legal action for mail fraud in the United States. A further side note is that Crowley's organization - the OTO - was founded by a person who had joined Freemasonry but was a member for less than a couple of years before being dropped from the rolls.

Thomas Hamilton - The murderer of children in 1996 in Dunblane, Scotland. - Incomplete information at the time of this tragedy incorrectly attributed Masonic membership to Hamilton, perhaps because his grandfather who raised him after his natural parents had separated had been a Mason for some 40 years or perhaps because there were many other Thomas Hamiltons in the immediate area, two of whom were Masons (but both of whom were alive and well, one over 90 years of age).

His Masonic affiliations were tenuous, to day the least. No Body or Lodge has ever acknowledged Santa Anna as a member. His claim to membership actually depends on the apron he claimed his own, plus the incidents in which he identified himself by the signs of recognition in use tat that time. If indeed Santa Anna was a Freemason, he was the most reprehensible example of what one should be.\" (Brother Bennett's excellent book is certainly worth reading for the story of the Alamo defenders, Texas Rangers, and so much more.

Please Read On ... We're not really claiming that we're perfect: it's simply not true! Masonry has it's faults and problems. Sometimes a member slips into alcoholism, mental depression or other forms of sickness. Sometimes a member will forget his vows and act wrongly towards another human being. Sometimes a member will cheat, steal, or wrong someone else. It has happened, much as we'd like to wish it had not. When it does, anti-Masons are quick to point out these shortcomings. Rather than extend a helping hand to someone who has stumbled or fallen, they'd rather mock and rejoice in the ill-fortune. Most seem to get great pleasure in the pain and suffering another member of mankind is facing - and justify their glee because in their minds, 'Masons deserve whatever they get!' Most people understand that you can not judge an entire organization by the actions of one member - particularly when that member is acting as an individual and not on behalf of the organization. Nevertheless, anti-Masons quickly attribute whatever perceived shortcoming they find in a fellow human being as a result of their Masonic connection. Is this rational? Not really - but it happens, and far too often. If a person gives a break or benefit to a relative, it's often 'expected' yet when a Mason helps someone they might know through their lodge, they're accused of 'protecting' another Mason. If for some reason they had not become involved, then they would have been charged with abandoning their brothers. It's a no-win situation - but could be resolved in the minds of the anti-Masonic faction if there were no Masonry. Interesting too is when one of 'theirs' falls, they quickly distance themselves and suddenly the person or ideology seems to cease to exist in their minds. At one point in the US, many fundamentalist preachers used Masonry as one of their convenient 'whipping boys'; following the spectacularly visible 'fall from grace' by so many of them, now anti-Masons seem quite reluctant to tout their particular spiritual leader apparently because of fear that he may soon be found in some scandal. Regardless, though, few Masons relish the thought of someone else suffering. The precepts of Masonry encourage toleration and forbearance. Masonry supports the concept that it is far better to help someone up than to kick them down. For that reason alone, we will perhaps never be able to be understood by those who enjoy the sufferings of their fellow human beings! file:///C|/Webs/Antimasonry2/perfect.htm (1 of 2) [7/3/02 2:08:50 PM]"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Masons ARE Perfect Are all Masons perfect? No, they aren't...  but most are striving to be better! While imitation has been called the sincerest form of flattery, we were shocked and a bit dismayed when, in October, 2000, we found the following announcement in an online mailing list in which we participate: \"Brethren I have received the following article which is part of \"The Keystone Communicator\" (Volume 10, Issue 6) which is a Bi-Monthly Publication of Keystone Lodge No. 251, F. & A.M. located in <location removed>. The Senior Deacon of that Lodge, <name removed>, wrote the article. I found the article very interesting and I am passing it on to you.\" The article was that as shown above! Word for word, comma for comma, and even including the ellipsis which we constantly use in our writing. It's disappointing that Masons - who should know better - take material they've obtained elsewhere and use it as their own. Our site has been very favorably received by the writer's Grand Lodge and they've included links to us from their web site. This page has been on our site unchanged almost from its inception in summer, 1998. We were inspired to write it by a newsgroup posting that said, in effect, 'You Masons think you're perfect....'. I thought - well, that's not quite true and proceeded to pen the item above. I'd never seen any other Masonic author write anything quite so 'brash' and chuckled to myself about it. Then it was put aside and nearly forgotten until about two years later when, I was saddened to find, that it had been plagiarized. Perhaps my Brother had no idea where he'd found the material (it happens, I know) but its doubtful he'd have forgotten that he had not written it.
