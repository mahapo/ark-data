It was a bright, hotmorning when I began to notice the multicolored ambulances from all over thecity—Columbia Presbyterian, Metropolitan, St. Vincent's— traveling alongside andpassing me, all exiting at Bellevue Hospital.I volunteered my services to the transforming emergency center at Bellevue thatmorning, absorbing the rush of human emotion— at once committed to the task andyet frightened. The fact that ultimately there weren't the survivors to fill ourbeds did little to stem the fright. People worked to keep their minds off theunfolding disaster, and this, I discovered, was a necessary coping strategy.As I volunteered my services to the Red Cross and to my patients in thesucceeding months, I discovered a newfound vulnerability. I entered the mediaworld and found that each health care topic I discussed in an article or on TVseemed blown out of proportion to the real danger. I seized the chance to learnabout each succeeding \"bug du jour\" and to try to offer perspective and a salveof reassurance whenever I could.We all personalized 9/11, and it made us all feel more at risk, whether we werereally at risk or not. We grew afraid more easily than before, misinformed byour leaders and provoked by the news media.PREFACEAnthrax was the first manifestation in concrete terms of this personalizedsusceptibility. I was* honored to participate in a U.S. Senate investigationinto the handling of the anthrax crisis, directed by Senator Chuck Grassley ofIowa. I discovered amidst the CDC and U.S. Postal Service papers and letters toand from the senator a sense of fumbling. Fear out of proportion to the realrisks was made worse by a lack of preparedness. Even if you didn't have a reasonto be afraid before, you could see how poorly you would be protected if therereally were a reason to fear.During the health care scares of the next few years, my patients shared theirfears with me every day. I have changed their names here in order to protecttheir privacy, but I would never have been able to conceive of fear in realterms if it weren't for their willingness to share their concerns andexperiences.I witnessed their fear of SARS, despite the fact that I never saw any evidencethat SARS was close to becoming widespread. My office phone rang with anxietiesover influenza as it went from being a ho-hum underappreciated killer to thelatest rage.In addition to my patients, I have a great appreciation for my family. Not onlydid they bear with the many investigations and revisions that constitute thisbook, but they also served as my subjects. I'll never forget the time that Icame home from a conference on bioterror, where I had discouraged people fromgearing up for worst-case scenarios all the time, only to find my wife Luda'smedicine drawer emptied of cold remedies and replaced with Cipro as a precautionagainst an anthrax attack.I understood from the outset that our fear mechanism had gone awry, but I didn'tknow exactly how. I could study the process by which dangers were manufacturedand provoked, but as a medical doctor I also had to study the originalfight-or-flight mechanism that was intended to protect us. The place to startwas with animals. My patient and friend Sylvain Cappell, a top-flightmathematician at New York University and well connected to the scientificcommunity, was very committed to the notion that my book be as scientificallybased and accurate as possible. He helpedPREFACEme arrange interviews with some of the people who helped me articulate the coreprinciples of fear physiology. I am indebted to his friends and colleaguesRachel Yehuda, Joe Ledoux, Chris Jolly, Esther Sabban, and John Mann.Eric Nelson, senior editor at Wiley and a vegetarian, first heard about thisbook over eggplant parmigiana at a midtown Italian restaurant. He immediatelycommitted himself to the project with great excitement and has never lookedback. I am very grateful for his generative ideas and great forbearance. NancyRothschild, R J. Campbell, Anna Christensen, and Devra K. Nelson at Wiley havebrought passion and skill to the project.Likewise, Joelle Delbourgo, agent for the book, has been devoted to itthroughout the long process of its birth. She was faithful to my fear conceptfrom the moment she first heard it.Jennifer E. Berman and Jennifer Choi and the NYU School of Medicine publicrelations team, along with Nadine Woloshin of Rubenstein Associates all offeredcrucial support.I am also grateful and privileged in terms of early readers of the manuscript.The views of the great novelist E. L. Doctorow were indispensable, as were thoseof the consummate sportswriter Ira Berkow. No one read this book more tirelesslyand devotedly than my friend Kenneth Blaker. My sister Fran and the filmproducer Donald Laventhal also offered important suggestions throughout theeditorial process. The final stages were aided by the insights of DavidGoldston, Hugh Gilmore, and Hesh Kestin.In the end, though, I have the print and television media to thank the most. Byallowing me to participate, as a spy as much as a contributor, the news mediapermitted this book, for the most part, to write itself.IntroductionTHE FEAR EPIDEMICThere is—was the feeling, oh, gee, we didn't do enough on 9/11, so let's makesure we warn everyone.—Bob Woodward on CNN's Larry King Live, April 23, 2004Fear invades our homes like never before, affecting more and more people.Newspaper headlines are apocalyptic warnings. Media obsessions fuel our cyclesof worry, which burn out only to be replaced by more alarming cycles.The passions and routines of everyday life are our primary defenses against thiscontagious fear. These defenses, however, are being eroded, bombarded by theongoing doom-and-gloom of the daily news. Twenty-four hours of cable newsinfiltrates our sleep and may be as damaging to our health as cigarette smoke isto our defenses against cancer.How did it get to be this way? Fear is looming larger in our lives. Yet no onehas tried to integrate what scientists have learned about the physiology of fearwith the increased reliance on fear on the part of both the media and thepoliticians. Of course some fears have their origin in real events, mostprominently the attacks ofFALSE ALARMSeptember 11, 2001, but the overall climate of fear is inflated well out ofproportion to the reality and is its own core danger to society.My investigations of fear have shown that it is designed to be protective, thatanimals use it to sense genuine threats to their survival. At the same time, wehumans have the ability to exaggerate fear until it threatens our health.Under the stress of unremitting fear, we become more susceptible to disease,including heart disease, stroke, and cancer. Once we become sick, our feargrows. In my medical practice I deal with many patients who are so alarmed bytheir illness that even offering an effective treatment isn't enough to reassurethem. In treating this fear in my patients, and in analyzing health care scaresin my newspaper writing and on television, I have tried to uncover the moment oflost perspective when dangers are first distorted.My investigation of fear started with the discovery that animals respond byinstinct and conditioning, while we, with the same essential fear apparatus asthey have, feed our fears through verbal communication. A zebra is wise to beafraid of a roaring lion, yet we are not so wise to fear a metaphorical lionthat is a thousand miles away from us. As soon as we hear about a danger,however remote, we tend to see it as a personal threat, especially if the dangeris exaggerated to begin with.This pattern of distortion led me directly to the media. How many of us listento somber-toned newscasters and expect that what we are hearing is validinformation? Many of us grew up believing we could find truth in the news. Whendid the crew-cut, thick-glasses, thin-tie anchorman become today's harbinger ofdoom?For me, realization of the fundamental change in the media occurred at thebeginning of May 2004, when I received a phone call from the WNBC-TV doctor,David Marks. He was looking for a sound bite about the new Medicare discountcards, the latest in false comfort.Marks was a well-dressed young internist with news-anchor features and a kindlyface. He had a private practice in Connecticut,THE FEAR EPIDEMICand he came to New York two days a week to tape health spots for the TV station.As we were being powdered and prepped for the interview, I mentioned that I wasinvestigating the epidemic spread of fear.\"What role do you think the media play?\" I asked him.\"We're so guilty of spreading it,\" he said. \"I don't like reporting theoverhyped stories that unnecessarily scare people. But these are my assignments.I try to put things in perspective, to do my best to tone things down, butsometimes I wish we weren't covering these stories at all.\"I was looking for just this kind of direct admission from a card-carrying memberof the media.Media people I've met are serious and sincere, which doesn't mean they alwayssee risk in a proper context. Newspapers issue daily corrections but do notroutinely acknowledge when threats that are reported don't materialize.In studying fear, I have come to believe that it has a tendency to reigniteitself. Once a fear fire is extinguished, another one takes its place. There arefear seekers in our society, and these groups are always expanding in number andinfecting new members. People are especially susceptible on the coasts, wherefear of terrorism is greatest, but there are plenty of worriers in between.When it comes to the fear epidemic, are we Americans unique? In parts of theworld where wars and acts of terrorism have been more commonplace, America hasthe reputation of being a country with a soft underbelly. In Israel most peoplemanage to live relatively normal lives despite frequent suicide bombings andconstant military conflict. This is because statistically, a walk to thesupermarket in Israel is still far more likely to be uneventful than unsafe, andthe public has come to understand and accept the small level of individual risk.As a result, in Israel and in other societies whose citizens live with similaruncertainties, people become desensitized to the chance of terrorism over time;the threat gradually becomes less immediate, and thus more in keeping with thestatistical probability of terrorism actually taking place.FALSE ALARMStill, even in Israel the threat of terrorism has had a cumulative effect onhealth. Desensitization, as I will show throughout this book, is not a cure, andpeople in Israel live stressful lives. Suicide bombings that occurred there in2001 have been shown to have an impact on the perceived sense of safety in 2002.A study that appeared in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine in July 2004 showedthat Israeli women who expressed fear of terrorism had twice as high a level ofan enzyme that correlates with heart disease, compared with their less fearfulcompatriots.It is not necessary to have a psychiatric disorder in order to be made ill byfear. This is the essential distinction between the well-described diagnoses ofanxiety and phobia and the new fear disease that can victimize anyone. Andsuperimposing fears on a population that is already riddled with phobias andanxieties can induce paralysis.Imagine how someone who is afraid of flying felt after being saturated by themedia images of September 11. Or someone who loathes insects, when she readsabout mosquitoes and West Nile. Or a healthy person, trying to control hischolesterol by diet alone, who is compelled to view ad after ad of smilingathletes who supposedly stay healthy only by taking a certain cholesterol drug.The symptoms of fear, the maladaptive kind, include an exaggerated sense ofvulnerability, fear of a danger that doesn't exist, or fear out of proportion tothe risk. Like any illness, the illness of fear interferes with function. Fearvictims are revved up in fight-or-flight mode. Their bodies ask them, how is aperson to be protected from an ever-growing threat without being on the alert?Stress hormones—adrenaline, catecholamines, and Cortisol—are secreted in excessamounts. These counterregulatory hormones cause the liver to make more sugar andcreate more and more energy, which builds up without outlet. To this, nervoussedentary people add more stimulants such as coffee, which revs them up further.People don't eat well, sleep well, or experience sufficient pleasure becausethey are always on the alert.THE FEAR EPIDEMICWhy such an easy path to hysteria? For months I pored through books and articlestrying to figure this out. The tiny pecan-shaped organ deep in the center of allanimal brains—the amygdala— serves as the central station for processing fear.Once it has been triggered, the amygdala is difficult to deprogram. The highercenters that help you to unlearn fear are weak compared to the hardwiring of thecentral amygdala.Beyond our animal instincts, for many of us our Judeo-Christian background makesfear a familiar concept that can easily motivate us. A disapproving God, welearn, is ready to punish us. Postmodern panic may have its origins in thecollective memory of biblical scourges.With fear infecting and reinfecting us, our pill-happy culture looks fortreatments rather than cures. Whether this pill is propranolol, Valium, Prozac,or another new brew, we are told that without it, we will be compelled to livein terror. Rather than examine why we are unnecessarily afraid, rather thanripping out this weed of fear by its roots, we attempt to neutralize it withpostmodern concoctions.In addition to pills, we seek the ultimate vaccine. In a study from Israel inMay 2004, Jonathan Kipnis gave a chemical cocktail to panicked mice and foundthat by bolstering their beleaguered neurons, the mice were once again able toperform their usual tasks. The implication of these results—if they proveapplicable to humans—is that immunologically engineered \"vaccines\" may help tomake people impervious to panic. But it is one thing to employ sophisticatedtechnologies to bolster an overworked nerve fiber in a troubled brain, it isanother to bottle the latest preventative and market it widely to treat allfear. Instead of learning how to assess risk realistically, we will try to treatfear with the latest in immunology.Traditional vaccines already provide us with an apparent shield against our fearof illness. In the fall of 2004, many of the people who trampled over each otherin line to get a flu shot at a time of sudden shortage were more at risk ofexhaustion than of flu. ButFALSE ALARMas with the faraway roar of the lion, the widely held belief that people are atgreat risk of the flu is a media creation. So too is the perception that asimple inoculation removes that risk.The public pendulum swings from dependency on a supposed panacea to panic when avaccine is found to be flawed or is no longer available. The government makesfear a central part of its agenda, trying to weigh in as our protector. In theprocess of being so \"protected,\" we learn about dangers we didn't know existed.The real danger of being manipulated in this way is to our health.I learned firsthand of the devastating reach of governmental fear mongeringwhen, at the request of Senator Chuck Grassley, I examined the response to the2001 anthrax mailings. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) attached itself tothe media megaphone and made us all feel afraid to open our mail. This responsewas a way of covering up the miscommunication and mishandling of the evidence byall the federal agencies involved.The anthrax scare established a precedent for public health hysteria that hasbeen racheted up with each new bug du jour, to the point where the public feelsthreatened by every possible source of contagion. Smallpox extended the hype toa bug that is no longer infecting anyone. SARS was the first panic to involvethe worldwide health community and petrify Asia and Canada along with the UnitedStates. The flu scare turned an overlooked disease into a sensation overnight.The government was sometimes a greater danger than the supposed threat. In itshaste to protect us from chemical and biological weapons, for example, thegovernment built expensive high-security laboratories to study these potentialweapons. But a study published in February 2001 found that of twenty-one knowngerm attacks, most were conducted not by terrorists but by governmentresearchers-turned-terrorists who had gained access to human pathogens.And until it becomes an election issue, our leaders practically ignore the riskof nuclear terrorism, where a terrorist smuggling aTHE FEAR EPIDEMICsuitcase onto a plane or boat can get past the porous safety net and cause greatharm. As Harvard scholar Graham Allison wrote in his book Nuclear Terrorism,this is one worst-case scenario that we aren't doing enough to prevent.As I interviewed people for this book, I found many who were wistful for the\"good old days.\" Perhaps our greatest immunity against panic has always comefrom go-to people in charge of our safety: the policemen, firefighters, andemergency medical technicians. But these comforting presences are being forcedto compete with the all-purpose information glut. Tiny bites of data are alwayswithin reach via the Internet, the television, and the radio. Many of mypatients complain that they don't know where to go to find answers that don'tfrighten them. Our personal narratives are gradually giving way more and more tothe discourse of risk and danger.We believe that strangers are a threat to us, but as Barry Glass-ner, the authorof The Culture of Fear, has pointed out, most crimes involve people known to thevictim.The narratives of this book are drawn from the many patients I know who live infear and who struggle to cope in the face of growing misinformation. Theirstories are juxtaposed here with the true science that eludes them and thesocietal trends that heighten their anxiety.Despite the growing fear, there are those who develop hard reflexes to cope withreal dangers. Emergency workers are trained to put their own risks inperspective. Firefighters cannot function if they are afraid of being burned orovercome by smoke, and doctors have to put aside their fear of catching apatient's illness in order to do their jobs. This training requires aconcentrated effort.A social plan for stabilizing public hysteria involves countering false beliefsregarding danger. But fear researchers have determined that seeing fear inpractical terms isn't easy.In examining fear, I have attempted to find a new social model to explaintoday's post-9/11 outbreak. Using my tools as an internist, I have discoveredthat the disease model for infectionFALSE ALARMand epidemic fits fear the best. Fear is physiological, but today's fear hasbecome pathological. It spreads via distorted hype to those who may not havebeen worried in the first place.We build up a partial immunity to each cycle of fear with the simple passage oftime. We become desensitized, and we learn that the threat we have been coachedto fear is not likely to occur. But fear is not easily unlearned. Our deepemotions can override our reason at any time.Groundbreaking animal studies by Dr. Esther Sabban show that once frightened, ananimal is more susceptible to the next threat that comes along. Fear memory,like all the powerful emotions deep in our brains, is hard for us to overcome,or outreason.Fear has become pervasive. In order to eradicate it, we must first understand itfrom the microscopic level all the way to the larger issues of national defenseand public safety. In examining fear, I have attempted to use my understandingof health and disease as a lens to spot the epidemic as it is spreading andinfecting more and more people. I begin with the biology, move on to thepersonal, and then widen my lens to the systemic.To understand why our society's hysteria has grown, I've found it is importantto look at the individual. I've tried to determine why a person's physiology canturn so quickly to pathology.Part I examines how our fear biology can wear us down rather than protect us.Fear deeply affects individual patients, from physical illness all the way toimagined terrorism. The government, media, and private businesses contribute tothe perpetual pressure to be afraid.Part II takes a look at the phenomena of publicly reported infections and howthese scares contribute to a growing climate of panic.Part III explores the border between religion and superstition, as well as therelationship between hypochondria, anxiety, and common fear. I examine thequestion of whether unnecessary fear can be eliminated.In my life, in treating my patients, and in studying fear, I have found that oneeffective treatment for fear is to replace it withTHE FEAR EPIDEMICanother deep emotion, like caring. If a person develops a passion that takes himbeyond a self-absorbing cycle of worry, this passion can be used to breed theantithesis of fear, also known as courage.My three-year-old daughter, Rebecca, fractured her thigh bone in a fall. Forseveral days after the cast was removed and an X-ray had shown that the bone hadhealed, she remained afraid to walk on it. Finally, during an exciting time atthe beach she stood on the sand and watched the waves come in. By the time fearmemory got ready to extend its shadowy tentacles, it was too late—she wasalready placing weight on the healed leg. Once Rebecca experienced the reward ofrenewed mobility, she was able to neutralize her fear.Those with courage or passion may be able to experience the relative safety ofour society by standing up to fear arising from exaggerated dangers. If enoughpeople develop courage, this immunized group can slow the spread of fear throughtheir community in the same way that those who have been vaccinated slow thespread of any contagion.Part IFIGHT OR FLIGHTWHY ARE WE SO AFRAID?We cannot wait while dangers gather.—Condoleezza Rice, then national security adviser, addressing the 9/11Commission on April 8, 2004Fear has been with humankind from the beginning and is part of our psychologicalmakeup from birth. Our earliest fears are tied to Mommy disappearing even for aninstant, taking away our only comfort and protection. Children are afraid of theunknown. It is only as they develop that they learn to distinguish a sense ofglobal uncertainty from a specific danger.As we become adults, our fears are tied to specific threats, an association thatdistinguishes fear from anxiety. Anxiety can be self-perpetuating, as it oftenoriginates in neurosis or self-doubt. Anxious people worry when they don't needto. Fear, on the other hand, is meant to be an essential tool. We have inheritedthe fear apparatus, practically unchanged, from our animal forebears, but weoften allow it to generate self-defeating hysteria.When fear is unremitting, especially when it is constantly provoked but noprotective action can be taken, anxiety and hysteria often result.FALSE ALARM\"You're absolutely fine,\" I say to my patient who can't catch her breath.\"No, I'm not,\" she insists, coughing and wheezing.It is only when she tells me that her wedding is the following weekend that Isee her fear turning to anxiety, and decide to forgo an extensive lung workup.The Biology of FearFear is more than a state of mind; it's chemical. It is present in the circuitryof our brains, in the neurochemical exchanges between nerves. Fear is a physicalreaction to a perceived threat. As long as the danger is direct and real, fearis normal and helps to protect us.When an individual feels threatened, fear revs up the metabolism in anticipationof an imminent need to defend oneself or flee. \"Fight or flight,\" or the \"acutestress response,\" was first described by Walter Cannon, an Americanphysiologist, in the 1920s. Cannon observed that animals, including humans,react to threats with a hormonal discharge of the nervous system. There is anoutpouring of vessel-constricting, heart-thumping hormones, includingnoradrenaline (norepinephrine) and adrenaline (epinephrine), followed by thesteroid Cortisol. The heart speeds up and pumps harder, the nerves fire morequickly, the skin cools and gets goose bumps, the eyes dilate to see better, andthe brain receives a message that it is time to do something.We need to know when another animal is threatening to attack us in order to killus and eat us. The fact that this particular threat doesn't exist anymoreoutside of the darkest jungles doesn't mean that fear can no longer be useful,as it is when we stand too close to the edge of a building or turn the wrong waydown a one-way street. Triggers of fear involve sudden or dramatic changes inour environment, including dark, light, cold, heat, noise, isolation, orirritation. We react by getting ready, either to attack the source of our fearor to move away from it.WHY ARE WE SO AFRAID?But not all danger is palpable or immediate. Many of the things that scare usaren't sudden, surprising, or matters of life or death. Fear has many guises.For every change of life there is a new set of concerns. For every milestonethere is a transition, and fear and foreboding are normal aspects of makingthese transitions. They are the body's way of cautioning us that the change mayor may not be for the better.People enter puberty, graduate from high school, leave home to attend college,have sex for the first time, get married, give birth to a child, lose a parent,face serious illness, have surgery, lose a spouse, and finally, face their owndeath. In each case, fearfulness may accompany the life adjustment as aphysiological warning to go slow. The fear reaction is normal and evenprotective, provided that it wears off after a while. The body needs time toadjust to new circumstances, after which it should return to a state of normalfunction.Fear is a natural reaction to the unknown and is part of our built-in defenseagainst a potentially hostile environment. We are afraid of suffering and pain,and we seek to avoid it at all costs.What Has Gone Awry?In recent years the climate of fear has changed.Statistically, the industrialized world has never been safer. Many of us areliving longer and more uneventfully. Nevertheless, we live in fear of worst-casescenarios. Over the past century, armed with scientific and technologicalbreakthroughs, we Americans have dramatically reduced our risk in virtuallyevery area of life, resulting in life spans 60 percent longer in 2000 than in1900. Antibiotics have reduced the likelihood of dying from infections. It usedto be that a person could die from a scratch. Now we gobble down antibiotics atthe first sign of trouble. Public health measures dictate standards fordrinkable water and breathable air. Our garbage is removed quickly. We livetemperature-controlled, disease-controlled lives.FALSE ALARMAnd yet, we worry more than ever before. The natural dangers are no longerthere, but the response mechanisms are still in place, and now they are turnedon much of the time. We implode, turning our adaptive fear mechanism into amaladaptive panicked response.We are bombarded with information. We live by TV sound bite and by Internethyperbite. Medical information has become agenda-driven, exaggerated by themedia and disseminated on the Internet. The expectation of perfect health isperpetuated by these sources. Illness is no longer accepted as part of thenatural order of things, and as consumers, we have become terrified of alldisease, even though most of the time, doctors can diagnose an illness and offereither a cure or an effective treatment. Still, we continue to worry.Our brains are not being infiltrated or provoked to panic by accident. Since9/11 especially, the government has exploited its role as our officialprotector, from Homeland Security to the CDC. Airport screeners and the FBI aresupposedly the last line of defense between Osama bin Laden and the citizens ofwestern Ohio.Every warning about a scary new disease, every report of terrorist chatter, andevery ultra-frail senior citizen becomes a justification for some governmentworker's job, from a research scientist all the way to President Bush himself.Government officials and politicians employ the media megaphone to promote theidea that they are keeping the populace safe. Unfortunately, there is noevidence that ongoing terror alerts correlate with the actual risk of apotential attack. After a while the public becomes desensitized and can't tell areal alert from the latest hype. For example, promoting worst-case scenarioswith biological or chemical weapons that may easily be blown away by the wind ordestroyed by heat is a form of propaganda that makes people afraid and ready tocomply with the government's agenda. It is misleading to call nerve gas oranthrax weapons of mass destruction when these are more likely tools thatterrorists would use on a smaller scale. It would be extremely difficult todeploy chemical or biological agents to largeWHY ARE WE SO AFRAID?numbers of potential victims at once. Drone planes seeding the air would likelybe shot down before they could complete their tasks.Of course, government officials can't grab the media megaphone if the mediathemselves don't make it available. The mass media tend to magnify the latesthealth concern and broadcast it to millions of people at once. This has theeffect of elevating an issue to a grand scale and provoking panic way out ofproportion to the risks. I call this phenomenon the \"bug du jour.\" The craze ofthe moment appears to be a threat to our personal safety until it runs itscourse through the media spotlight. And when a new threat hits, privatecompanies take their cues from media outlets and begin to line up for profit.The authorities we used to look to in the community have been replaced byunfeeling conglomerates that thrive in a climate of uncertainty. The oldleather-handed pharmacist, who suggested what type of condoms or deodorant tobuy, has been replaced by the impersonality of a twenty-four-hour, neon-beamingchain store. Our old librarian, once more interested in children even thanbooks, has given way to software; how much reassurance can be found in anInternet search engine?We turn to quick and easy prescriptions instead of reliable information. As Iwill examine in Chapter 7, pharmaceutical companies aren't just treatingpreexisting fears with the old standbys Prozac or Valium, they're also busypopularizing disorders to create demand for their new products.Why Have We Become So Defenseless?When Lyme disease, a troublesome bacteria transmitted to humans by the bite of adeer tick, was being hyped ten years ago, one of my most rational patients, amathematics professor, was certain he had it every time he got a rash, even whenhe was living in Los Angeles, a city with zero deer.\"The chances of your having it are almost nonexistent,\" I assured him.FALSE ALARM\"Forget probabilities, I can just feel it,\" he said on more than one occasion.Ten years later, with Lyme very much on the increase but out of the mediaspotlight, this patient—who by this time had moved to deer-ridden Connecticut—nolonger had concerns about the now prevalent Lyme disease, but worried insteadabout bioterrorism. As well as he understood probabilities and equations, whenhe turned on the news at night or read his newspaper in the morning, he oftenpersonalized the latest risk and became worried that he might die.Like my professor patient, we absorb the sense of urgency and believe we are indanger. So busy are we with fake threats that we ignore real threats.With over 8 million cases of tuberculosis every year in the world, 5 million newcases of AIDS, over 300 million cases of malaria, and over a million deaths dueto each, Americans rarely worry about these diseases. In the United Statesapproximately 40,000 people die of influenza every year, a statistic that wentunnoticed until 2003, when it was the flu's turn on the wheel of hype. In 2000,63,000 Americans died of pneumonia, and 15,000 people of AIDS. This informationstayed out of the news. In comparison to our real killer bugs, only 284 peopledied here of West Nile virus in 2002, when it was publicized by the media andperceived as a great threat.In 2003, when Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) arrived and became almostsynonymous with the word virus, there were only 7,000 cases in the world, andfewer than 100 in the United States. No one here died of SARS, but a lot ofpeople worried unnecessarily. Many patients called me in the spring of 2003convinced that the slightest cough was SARS. People were afraid to sit next toan Asian person or to eat in a Chinese restaurant.Our public health system, specifically the World Health Organization and theCenters for Disease Control here in the United States, drove the media responseto help contain SARS, quarantining Canada and most of Asia, and ultimatelytaking credit whenWHY ARE WE SO AFRAID?SARS died down. Actually, there was no direct evidence that the massive travelalerts really squashed SARS as much as historically proven factors likeisolating those who had the disease, as well as the arrival of summer,traditionally a difficult time for respiratory viruses to thrive. Still, thepublic perception was that SARS had gone overnight from being a worldwide threatin the spring of 2003 to no threat at all by June. We braced ourselves for thenext bug du jour and forgot all about SARS. In the summer of 2003, weexperienced a temporary reprieve—West Nile did not reappear on our media screensthat summer, and hardly anyone was afraid that his next mosquito bite would behis last.Many of the bugs du jour are cause for concern only among a narrow segment ofthe population. Only a small portion of those who believe they are at riskreally are, and few who become infected actually die. But a strange disease thatkills only a few people still makes for good headlines if the story isstrategically hyped. Many news teasers use the line \"Are you and your family atrisk?\" The answer is usually no, but that tagline generates concern in everyviewer, and this is what keeps people tuned in. If we didn't fundamentallymisunderstand the risk, we probably wouldn't watch.Each terror alert is like another bug du jour. We talk of sarin, which killedonly twelve people in a Japanese subway in 1995 but panicked thousands, and canpanic us here without so much as a single case. Anthrax infected twenty-twopeople through the U.S. mail in the fall of 2001, killing five unfortunatepeople, yet had thirty thousand more taking the antibiotic Cipro, manyindiscriminately and without a doctor's prescription. It's hard to believe thatthere hasn't been a case of smallpox here since the 1940s for ail the attentionit has received. If it is ever again introduced into the population, it islikely to spread slowly, by respiratory droplet. Meanwhile, in 2002, the fear ofsmallpox spread far more virulently through the public, transmitted by word ofmouth.In the fall of 2004, the sudden shortage of flu vaccine in the United States ledto a stampede of people seeking the covetedFALSE ALARMelixir. During this vaccine shortage multitudes of healthy people becameconvinced that they could be overcome with the flu and die at any time. In fact,the first flu-related death that year came not from the disease, but from anelderly woman who fell while waiting for the vaccine amidst a thronging crowd. Iwrote an op-ed piece in the New York Post pointing out that the CDC haddetermined that the vaccine hadn't helped much the year before, was only 40-60percent effective, and was intended mostly for high-risk groups. My message: fluvaccine is not the health panacea that you think it is, you are not in greatdanger without it, and the sudden attention it is receiving has caused people tofeel a sense of urgency out of proportion to the real danger.I thought I'd accomplished something until I began to receive phone calls frompatients who had read my piece. Almost as an afterthought I'd mentioned that Ihad five vials, or fifty doses, to give to my sickest patients.\"I saw your article,\" one call began.\"Are you reassured?\" I asked.The patient ignored me. \"I understand you have some vaccine. Can I have a shot?\"Rather than worrying less after learning the facts, each patient wanted to beone of the lucky fifty and was calling me to beg for a dose.Reeducating the public when it came to panic was going to take far more than acorrective article that unintentionally became part of the hype.The year before, the deaths of a few children from flu in Colorado had ledinstantly to a nationwide panic before dropping from the news radar. Yet bothyears, despite all the concern, would turn out to be nonepidemic flu years.When the media or the government focuses on the bug du jour, we all feel it, asthough it's a palpable danger. When media attention is diverted elsewhere, themanifested fear fades but remains below the surface, waiting to attach itself tothe next hyped target.WHY ARE WE SO AFRAID?At a time in history when there are no true scourges, the population iscontrolled through fear. Rather than enjoy the safety that our technologicaladvances have provided us, instead we feel uncertain. Respiratory masks andother paraphernalia meant to shield us actually spread panic more effectivelythan any terrorist agent by sending the message that something is in the offing.Our personal fear alerts are turned on all the time. Fear is not intrinsicallypathological, it is a reaction to the pathology of our times.We feel the stress and have become more prone to irritability, disagreement,worry, insomnia, anxiety, and depression. We are more likely to experience chestpain, shortness of breath, dizziness, and headache.After weeks go by without our being shot by a sniper, bitten by a West Nilemosquito, gassed with sarin, or infected with SARS, people become desensitized.Each new phase of hysteria is followed by a brief period when our guard comesdown.But who can a frightened person count on for reliable information andreassurance?Teachers absorb the same information fragments that students do, reinforcing thestudents' sense of fear. Patients fear becoming ill, they fear the onset ofsuffering, and yet, doctors specialize in, and are trained to treat, specificdiseases rather than the patient as a whole.Patients hover nervously around the medical secretary's desk as their diagnosesroll in via faxed reports. The pills are better, the surgeries are better, andthe rehab techniques are better, but these positive developments are not enoughto offset the fear of test results.Managing Fear Like a DiseaseWhy are some people infected with hysteria out of proportion to the risks, whileothers seem impervious? Some of my patients worry over every symptom, whileothers never seem afraid of disease or death.FALSE ALARMI recall a stoic ninety-three-year-old patient who had been a professional tapdancer for many years. She continued to dance in recitals despite her advancingage, until her back gave out. She went to several surgeons, all of whom advisedagainst surgery, citing discouraging statistics. But she wasn't afraid. She hadfaith in her body and its ability to survive the surgery. Her passion fordancing outweighed any conceivable risk.\"Can the surgery help me dance again?\" she asked me.\"It's possible.\"\"Then I'll take my chances,\" she said.She sailed through the surgery and was dancing again a month later. For thispatient, no matter how many times I warned her about potential risk, she repliedthat she believed she would be fine, and the cycle of worry never started.Ultimately, we must develop prescriptions for the range of fears that patientsexperience. These prescriptions must be practical and designed to break thecycle of worry. Those in society who inform us and who care for us—whether ingovernment, the media, or health care—must be committed to maintaining aperspective based on realistic assessments of risk, rather than an agenda basedon politics or profit.IT WORKS FOR ANIMALS BUT NOT FOR USTake a rat and put it in a cage with a plexiglass divider. It sees the cat onthe other side. It's afraid it's going to be attacked. The associated fear isvery difficult to extinguish, even with the plexiglass there.—Esther Sabban, professor and graduate program director, Department ofBiochemistry and Molecular Biology, New York Medical CollegeWhen a patient is restrained inside a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machineduring a scan of the brain, his head is strapped down and his body is enclosedin a coffinlike chamber. A loud metallic banging sound is heard, and thepatient, like a restrained animal, may feel like he is never going to bereleased. The claustrophobia combines with the loud banging to cause anescalating fear.Even worse is the terror some women feel when undergoing a mammogram. One of mypatients described what it's like to wait while her breast has been painfullyflattened to a pancake by the pressure of the equipment. \"I have the awfulfantasy,\" she said,FALSE ALARM\"that the technician will die of a sudden heart attack or there will be a poweroutage, and my breast won't be released.\"A patient's instinct is to fight her confinement, even when she knows it is forher own good. This is the same instinct an animal experiences. In fact,accepting ourselves as animals is crucial to understanding how human fear isdesigned to work. The fear center of the human brain, the amygdala, is identicalto the primitive fear center of the animal brain.Dr. Joseph Ledoux, a prominent neuroscientist and the author of The EmotionalBrain, has studied fear extensively. He told me: \"When a rat is afraid and whena human is afraid, very similar things occur in the body.\" But Ledoux alsobelieves that triggers of fear vary dramatically from species to species. Hesaid, \"When a monkey is attacked, it will give off calls to other monkeys thatsomething has happened. If a rat is under attack by a cat, it will give off anultrasonic frequency in the range of rats, not cats. The frequency will be toohigh for a cat to hear.\"Ledoux described the amygdala as \"the hub in the brain's wheel of fear.\" Whenthe amygdala is stimulated, there is an outpouring of stress hormones, causing astate of hypervigilance. The amygdala processes the primitive emotions of fear,hate, love, bravery, and anger—all neighbors in the deep limbic brain that weinherit from animals. When the amygdala malfunctions, a mood disorder, or stateof uncontrollable apprehension, results.The amygdala works together only with other brain centers that feed it andrespond to it. This fear hub senses via the thalamus (the brain's receiver),thinks through the cortex (the brain's seat of reasoning), and remembers via thehippocampus (the brain's file cabinet).This cycle can become self-perpetuating. Here's an example of how it works: myyoung son was terrified by a sudden barking when we were hiking on a mountaintrail at sunset.I said, \"The dog is gone,\" but he said, \"No it's not. It keeps coming back.\"IT WORKS FOR ANIMALS BUT NOT FOR USNow each time a dog barks, it engages the same mechanism. My son's thalamustriggers his amygdala, which retrieves the fearful memory for him from thehippocampus, and his body goes into hyper drive.When the amygdala detects a threatening situation, out pour the stress hormones.The hippocampus alerts the amygdala's circuitry to a danger associated with ascary memory. At the same time, the hippocampus is also the center for caution.Under stress, the amygdala signals release while the hippocampus cautions slowdown.If the stress persists, the thinking brain falters, routine memories andbehaviors shut down, and fear predominates. Previous trauma biases the braintoward fear pathways, which continue to fire again and again during flashbacks.This explains why even when we may not consciously remember a traumatic event,we retain a powerful emotional memory that we cannot reason ourselves away from.When the amygdala fires, it transmits fear signals too rapidly and powerfullyfor any of the brain's regular brakes to stop it.Once a person has learned to fear something, he may always feel fear associatedwith that experience. But unlike mice, we humans can fear events we have onlyread or heard about, and so we worry about disasters we may never experience.If we are unable to respond for lack of an appropriate target, the fearaccumulates, and we become anxious.Fear ConditioningFear is user-ready at birth. As we grow, we are conditioned to respond tocertain triggers. The fear response becomes automatic, though the dangers maynot always be visible. If you put a rat in a box and shock it in the presence ofa tone, it will become conditioned to respond to the shock, the tone, and thebox. This contextual response helps an animal protect itself. The ability torecognize the box increases the likelihood of surviving the danger within byreacting quickly.FALSE ALARMWe are not rats, but we react similarly in terms of our primitive conditioning.Once a fear response is triggered, it may not diminish over time. Sometimesfears incubate, become indelible, and even increase in potency. They are oftenbrought back to life by stressful events. This is both good and bad. It isuseful for us to be able to remember situations associated with past dangers.But these memories may find their way into our daily lives, intruding onsituations where the fears have no use, causing panic, phobias, or posttraumaticstress. We may feel compelled to avoid anything associated with a seminal fearevent, including something that is neutral or even positive. If a barking dogbites a child, it may even lead to a self-defeating fear of all loud noises(including concert music), not just an adaptive fear of dogs.The dangers that provoke the fear response in humans can be real or imagined,concrete or abstract. We may witness them firsthand or hear about them fromothers. We have a far greater capacity to imagine dangers than a rat does, andthe potential for misperception is one of the major concerns of this book.Drs. Robert and Caroline Blanchard have studied how humans evaluate situationsfor risk using our most highly evolved brain functions. Despite our advancedevolution, we often fail to assess the level of risk accurately. We humans tendto overpersonalize risk and to experience an unrealistic sense of dangerwhenever we hear or read of a bad event occurring to someone else. Many of mypatients going for a routine CT scan will worry that they have a serious illnessas soon as they see the sicker patients in the waiting room. My parents, healthybut in their late seventies, respond with a \"We'll be next\" attitude whenever anambulance is called to the retirement complex in Florida where they live.A Primal ResponseHumans transmit danger signals in a way different from that used by animals.Ledoux said, \"Social communication is greater for humans than for any otherspecies. But it is difficult for humans toIT WORKS FOR ANIMALS BUT NOT FOR UScommunicate fear accurately. The evolution of the human brain allows us to haveideas that don't match reality that well. This mismatch is a source of humananxiety.\"All fear systems are intended to increase the likelihood of surviving adangerous situation. Ledoux has shown that this response fires so rapidly and sopowerfully that it overrides conscious thought.A balding man in his fifties with intensely focused eyes and a resonant voice,Ledoux gave a careful reasoned talk on the neuro-science of fear at New SchoolUniversity on February 6, 2004, as part of a multidisciplinary conference there.\"Fear is a natural part of life,\" Ledoux said. \"A snake on a path in the woodsis threatening. So is an angry human. We respond with bodily upheaval. Fight orflight. Muscles tighten in response to a threat or in anticipation of one. Wecome into the world knowing how to be afraid. We learn what to be afraid of.\"All animals with a backbone also have an amygdala. It takes only twelvemilliseconds, according to Ledoux, for the thalamus to process sensory imput andsignal the amygdala. He called this emotional brain the \"low road.\" The highroad, or the thinking brain, takes thirty to forty milliseconds to process whatis happening. The hippocampal memory center provides the context. \"People havefear they don't understand or can't control because it is processed by the lowroad,\" Ledoux said.The emotional brain also has its own intrinsic fear memory. Cells remember thefear and don't need to be reactivated, or reminded. Rats automatically respondto dangers they've seen previously.During stress, reasoned memory is impaired, and emotional memory predominates,since the amygdala sends more signals to the thinking brain than the other wayaround. Humans are at the mercy of fear impulses that override reason. The upperbrain tries to regulate fear, but its brakes are often ineffective at slowingthe powerful emotions of the system. Valium and Prozac block the amygdala bydifferent mechanisms, creating an artificial shield against fear.FALSE ALARMTake away the amygdala and you take away fear. In 1999 researchers at theUniversity of Southern California and the Uni-versite de Bordeaux published astudy in Nature in which they demonstrated the role of the amygdala in emotionalmemory. They implanted electrodes in the brains of laboratory mice and measuredthe strong response to a tone and a subsequent electric shock. When the amygdalawas surgically removed, both the animals' panicked immobility and the freneticbrain wave pattern disappeared.Similar results have been found in humans who have suffered trauma and damage tothe amygdala. They become unable to feel afraid even when they are presentedwith clear danger signals.At the fear conference, Ledoux spoke about the nature of the fear responseacross the entire animal kingdom. \"Fear is learned instantly. Fear is rememberedforever. Fear is self-sustaining. Fear motivates other kinds of behavior thatare designed to affect its impact.\"But inevitably, an appropriate fear response depends on access to accurateinformation. As Ledoux said at New School University, \"Will fear be based on anhonest assessment of the threat, or will it be trumped up?\"Characteristics of FearBack in the mid-1980s, Isaac Marks, a prominent fear theorist, described thebasic fear responses of withdrawal, immobility, fighting back, or submission.When these responses are not effective or when they become internalized over aperiod of time, anxiety may well result.What distinguishes fear reactions between humans and other animals is not thephysiology of fear but the triggers that activate it. For humans, our addedbrainpower allows defensive reactions to more and more triggers. Hence, we aremore prone to social anxiety.Fear also has a genetic component. A rat will rev up in response to the odor ofa fox even if that rat has spent its whole life in theIT WORKS FOR ANIMALS BUT NOT FOR USlaboratory. Humans are automatically fearful of situations that threatened ourancestors.Fear PathologyArne Ohman, a leader in the field of human fear and anxiety, has argued thatpanic, phobia, and posttraumatic stress all emanate from unremitting fears.In The Emotional Brain, Ledoux showed how pathological anxiety evolves from thebasic mechanisms of fear. Anxiety manifests itself in different ways: Phobiasare avoidance fears that can't be suppressed, panic attacks are circumscribedperiods of intense anxiety, and free-floating anxiety is worry that goes on andon. Obsessive-compulsive disorder involves rituals that are intended toneutralize anxiety but end up enhancing it by being so excessive. Withposttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the fear response fails to diminish withthe passage of time.Psychotherapy is an attempt to retrain the higher centers of the brain to exertcontrol over the lower centers, including the amygdala. This approach is similarto trying to rein in an untamed stallion. The amygdala may rear up at any time.Posttraumatic StressDr. Rachel Yehuda, a professor of psychiatry at Mount Sinai School of Medicine,is a passionate researcher and a pioneer in understanding posttraumatic stressdisorder. Her findings suggest that it is Cortisol that helps the body adapt toheavy trauma over time. Without this crucial steroid to aid in coping, a traumavictim can fall into a pattern of unremitting fear.In Dr. Yehuda's experience, many people exposed to extreme trauma do not developPTSD precisely because Cortisol protects them. She described PTSD as \"a failureto control the adaptive mechanism of the fear response.\" The key to a perpetualstate of terror, according to Yehuda, is an inability to suppress theFALSE ALARMamygdala. \"The usual limbic brake on the amygdala isn't working. Cortisol issupposed to initiate this. Without it, the stress response isn't contained.\"The popularizing of PTSD in the media has led many who aren't truly terrorizedto use it as an excuse for their hysteria. Overstatement dilutes the language ofterror and renders it less useful. \"The mention of posttraumatic stress occurswhen there is a shortage of terms for laypeople to use for their vulnerabilitieswhen confronted by trauma,\" said Yehuda.People who are afraid to get on a bus because they have seen a suicide bombingon the news are overpersonalizing a danger. This isn't really PTSD. It is aninflated perception of risk. Yehuda said, \"In America, we worry about whethersomething that hasn't happened could happen. In Israel, when something doeshappen, we worry about it occurring again.\"How Humans Learn to FearWe humans take for granted that language helps us to negotiate our world, but itis also true that we often misuse and misinterpret words. The fear responseworks best based on nonverbal cues. When we humans try to use abstract languageto communicate threats, we too easily overload and provoke the fear response.Dr. Elizabeth Phelps, a psychologist and neuroscientist at New York University,has examined how our brains respond to threats we only envision. Although peoplelearn about dangerous events through hard experience—a dog is deemed dangerousbecause it once bit you—we also learn about dangers by watching—you observe adog bite someone else.Using highly sensitive MRI scans, Phelps discovered that the amygdala can beactivated in response to dangers a person merely observes. Phelps concluded thatfear activation based on watching is just as powerful as direct experience, buteasily prone to misinterpretation. She said, \"When you are watching it and youareIT WORKS FOR ANIMALS BUT NOT FOR UStold that it is going to happen to you, it causes the same robust response bythe amygdala as if you experienced it yourself.\"Turning Off FearIn November 2002 researchers working for the National Institute of Mental Healthpublished a study in Nature that described a way to turn off fear. Stimulatingthe front part of a rat's brain with an electrode caused it to automaticallyemit a \"safety signal\" that signaled the amygdala to slow down. When a tone wasrepeatedly presented to rats without the loud \"danger\" tone that at firstaccompanied it, over time the safety signal caused them to become less and lessafraid.In December 2002 researchers at Columbia University discovered the gene thatturns off fear in mice. The results were reported in the journal Cell.In September 2004 Dr. Phelps used specialized MRI to study the human brain, andshe discovered fear extinction circuits in humans that correspond to thosepreviously identified in rats. Phelps recognized the limitations of the animalmodel but concluded that our cognitive mechanisms are \"interacting with the samecircuitry as animals have.\"Like rats, humans can temporarily turn off fear, though in both cases the wiringheavily favors the on switch. Unlike rats, we humans are forever trying to turnoff something that should never have been turned on in the first place.\"Extinction is not erasing a fear but trying to control it,\" Phelps said.Our Constant State of AlertDr. Esther Sabban has studied fear by restraining animals. She believes theanimals react to the loss of control and \"not knowing if it's ever going toend.\" Dr. Sabban's work shows that animals that have been exposed to one dangerhave an exaggeratedFALSE ALARMresponse to a new danger. When she exposed an animal to the cold, the animalcould become used to it and learn not to react. But the same animal was thenhypersensitive to being restrained. The fear neurochemicals shot up higher andstayed that way for many days after the animal was untied. In other words,certain primitive fears can't be extinguished even when there is no danger.Once fear has been activated, it can lead to overreactions in all directions.This is how we feel when we are told that we could be attacked again by anunseen force like al-Qaeda. The fear response may well be suppressed over time,but it can resurface— stronger than before—and even extend to all aspects of ourlives. A person who thinks he has gotten used to the orange terror alert messageon the TV screen may nevertheless experience a hyper-alert response seeingsomeone with a gun in an airport, even if that person is a security guard. Thisnew state of hyperalertness originates in neurochemical fear memory thatdevelops over time. The capacity for desensitization is limited because theamygdala is stronger. It takes a lot of psychotherapy to override the fearmessage, and the fear center wakes up again with each new stimulus that comesalong.It is worrisome to consider what this state of free-floating communicated feardoes to our bodies. We gain or lose weight, our immune systems becomeoverloaded, and we become susceptible to diseases that we might otherwise havebeen able to resist.What We Get from ApesApes, like humans, have highly developed brain centers, with sophisticatedmemory and some ability to reason. But unlike humans, other primates appear tohave a dependable society that determines what alarms them. I spoke with Dr.Chris Jolly, a good-natured British anthropologist at New York University, whomaintains that apes have honest fear responses. Jolly has investigatedaggressive behavior among baboons.\"Are threats among primates always real?\" I asked him.IT WORKS FOR ANIMALS BUT NOT FOR US\"Usually,\" he said, \"primates don't use referential communication. Warningsignals concern things that are directly dangerous. They don't use fear talk todistract.\"I considered danger as perceived by the animal world. Has our technology made ustoo smart for our own good? Even if the animal world is more dangerous thanours, it is more honest: the threat of attack—when it occurs—is real.\"All animals that live in societies have a pecking order,\" Jolly said,\"including chickens, where the expression comes from. Part of organizing into ananimal society is to decide who is more powerful than you—animals convey asubmissive posture to others who are dominant to them. In more intelligentmammals, like wolves, for example, fear is based on a memory of what the enemyhas done in the past. There is a structure of tensions, flux in the hierarchy,young animals coming up to replace the older ones going down. The adherence tothe structure provides comfort.\"\"We humans have created environments that don't comfort us,\" I said, and Dr.Jolly laughed.\"Can the same thing happen to other primates?\" I asked. \"Can they lose touchwith real threats and create pseudothreats like humans do?\"Jolly paused, thinking carefully about this before he spoke.\"Rhesus monkeys have been studied in captivity. When they're crammed intosmaller spaces like the animal equivalent of cities, they become more aggressiveand more fearful. They also experience more stress and fear in ambiguoussituations and in situations of change.\"\"This is true for humans as well.\"Jolly agreed that in certain crowded baboon and chimpanzee societies we begin tosee the fear-provoking abstractions that are so prevalent among us humans.Dr. Robert Sapolsky, a researcher at Stanford, has examined baboon behaviorunder stress. By measuring stress hormones found in their stool, Sapolsky wasable to determine that baboons, like humans, live in high-stress societies, withorder maintained byFALSE ALARMintimidation. Sapolsky also showed that living in fear damages a baboon's healthand, as with humans, that sustained production of stress hormones can damage thehippocampus, affecting learning and memory.Chimps are probably the only nonhuman primate with a sense of self. \"They canput themselves in the position of other chimps,\" Jolly said. \"Chimps fool eachother. They use deceptive behavior to get gain.\"\"This deception causes other chimps to be afraid of them?\" \"The same as withhumans,\" Jolly said.Dr. Jane Goodall has studied chimpanzees extensively. Pertaining to fear, sheobserved that a band of young male chimps tenses up when it approaches theborder of their group's domain, psyching themselves up for the possibility ofbattle with neighboring chimp groups, a form of danger recognition. When thechimps menace each other purely for the sake of control or domination, they areexhibiting traits recognizable in their self-defeating human counterparts.What We Get from Each OtherDr. Paul Ekman, a professor of psychology at the University of California, SanFrancisco, Medical School, has studied danger recognition in humans. In his 2003book Emotions Revealed, he wrote that we can learn to be afraid of anything.Ekman focused on the facial expressions we use to communicate worry to eachother. Worry about an impending threat causes muscular tension. Ekman observedthat raised upper eyelids are fundamental in communicating fear. Unfortunately,these expressions can't easily communicate the degree of the threat, which iswhy expressions of fear are infectious and may alarm others unnecessarily.Like rats, we have defined pathways for invoking fear and for attempting tosuppress or extinguish it. Like rats, when we are caught in a maze of fear, wemay learn to navigate for a time, butIT WORKS FOR ANIMALS BUT NOT FOR USthe price is a state of hyperalert vigilance that burns up our metabolism andrenders us more susceptible to illness.In addition to the fight-or-flight conditioned fear that we inherit fromanimals, there are the elaborate communicated and learned fear and worry that wehumans alone possess and that we inflict on each other. The anticipation ofdanger based on risk involves the brain's highest centers, which then connect tothe amygdala and cause the reverberating states of panic and worry.This human fear is not reasonable but is driven by fragmented information, hype,miscommunication, and uncertainty. If we are unable to convert our uncertaintyinto a reasoned assessment of risk, we grow more and more afraid, caught up in acycle of worry. Feeling safe means coming to realize that the probability ofharm occurring to us is very small.Feeling safe also means returning fear to its proper place as an animalinstinct. Reason and abstract thinking are human trademarks. Our language is illsuited to communicating primitive emotions. Perhaps we can learn from animals amore limited but appropriate use of fear.OUR CULTURE OF WORRYWhat an appalling affront to share the intense desire for continued existencewith all living things but be smart enough to recognize the ultimate futility ofthis most basic biological imperative. We think that clash creates the potentialfor terror.—Tom Pyszczynski, professor of psychology at the University of Colorado andcofounder of terror management theoryAnimals may fear death as much as we do, but whereas animals freeze in the faceof immediate danger, we experience an ongoing existential fear, connected to ourunique self-awareness. Our central fear of death reaches beyond our animalinstincts and may threaten to overwhelm us. But like all our fears, our fear ofdeath is overblown when we are wrongly convinced that death is in the offing.Our fear of death is so pervasive it is too easily provoked.At the New School University fear conference, Dr. TomOUR CULTURE OF WORRYPyszczynski, a rumple-jacketed professor with flowing white hair, was a strikingcontrast to the balding, impeccably dressed Ledoux. Pyszczynski was one of theoriginators of terror management theory, and he described how all fear emanatesfrom a primary fear of death. \"Fear is supposed to function to keep us alive andhelp us stave off death. As an unpleasant emotion, it creates a barrier we'renot supposed to cross.\"Dr. John Mann is the director of neuroscience at the New York State PsychiatricInstitute and an expert on suicide. In an interview, he said that even in themost extreme cases, fear of death is designed to have a protective aspect. \"Takeaway this fear inhibition, and the person is no longer indecisive, and suicidemay ensue.\"But even if fear can be protective, it can also be destructive. As the onlyspecies that is aware of the inevitability of death, we have a great need forour culture to give us a sense of meaning and purpose. The growing unease in oursociety is testament to the fact that our culture is no longer capable of doingthe job. Pyszczynski theorized that fear out of control erodes our perceivedwellness. This fear of death, while essential, is self-defeating if it paralyzespeople.In order to buffer our dread, humans try to construct a shield— a value-ladenbelief system that bolsters our self-esteem and allows us to sublimate ourgreatest fears. We attempt to manage terror through a complex psychologicaldefense mechanism. Our primary instinct to circumvent death becomes our drive tomake art, pursue science, and construct civilizations that are intended to lastbeyond our years. The drive to have children is a biological, as well as acultural, answer to the fear of death. Overall, we feel safer when weparticipate in this culture.Unfortunately, this instinct toward culture may easily be transformed into anegative culture of worry. Multiple studies in the psychiatric literature overthe past fifteen years have corroborated the link between fear of death andthinking negatively about others. The culture of fear is one that breedsprejudice and distrust.FALSE ALARMThe growing epidemic of fear also encourages the expectation of illness anddeath. Many of us are overly afraid of illnesses we don't have. We maypersonalize the risk of death while lacking any disease that could cause death.And once we have an illness, many fear an outcome much more ominous than the oneindicated by reliable medical data.Cancer serves as a graphic illustration of this phenomenon. While the publicadvocacy campaign for cancer prevention has shone a necessary light on the evilsof cigarette smoking and carcinogens, it has also made people more fearful.Cancer is described in value-laden terminology like \"end stage\" or \"pervasive.\"Most cancers are treatable, yet the disease is still assumed to be a deathsentence. Thanks to technology, diagnoses are made quickly. One day you thinkyou are healthy, the next you have a life-threatening illness. Therapies aremisperceived as primitive rather than evolving. This perception is wrong.In the late 1990s, AIDS fell out of the U.S. health care news cycle and stoppedscaring us, while it continued to kill millions overseas and was misperceived asunder control here. Meanwhile cancer continues to scare us, in part because wecan't seem to control when and if we get it. Most patients are even frightenedof the screening tests such as mammograms and colonoscopies that make itpossible to treat cancer before it can kill them. Once cancer is found, and evenif it is cured, fear is the uninvited guest that whispers of its possiblerecurrence. As threatening as a cancer is, fear of death from cancer's insidioustentacles is even worse.As Dr. Pyszczynski might predict, there is a culture of cancer care that doesits best to alleviate these fears. Chemotherapy involves multiple social workersand self-help support groups. The radiation suite at our hospital is a calmtherapeutic milieu, including an aquarium with an extensive collection ofmulticolored tropical fish.Unfortunately, the growing culture of hyped fears offsets these attempts atsupport and insight. Fueled by fragments of bad newsOUR CULTURE OF WORRYfrom media and Internet sources, patients fear the worst-case scenario—a painfulimminent death.One Patient's Fear of DeathMy waiting room was filled with patients, but one in particular was telling thenurse that he couldn't bear to wait another moment. He was peering at herthrough tiny spectacles, better suited for a much older patient, which had slidto the end of his nose.He was a forty-four-year-old international businessman, and I could hear hisnervous accented speech through the waiting room window glass.I'd ordered a CT scan on \"Ephraim Azziz\" because he was a smoker. I reassuresmokers that the test is routine, that I am being compulsive, that a CT scan ismore sophisticated than an X-ray in analyzing a smoker's lungs. But almost allsmokers fear cancer, and it takes a negative result to truly reassure them.Knowing that a CT scan or other state-of-the-art test can foretell their futureputs many patients in a state of worry as soon as they are told to have thescan.Azziz went for the scan a few weeks after seeing me. The report came to me a fewdays later, indicating a three-centimeter nodule at the top of the right lung,consistent with cancer. Upon seeing the report, I told the office nurse that Ineeded to see Ephraim Azziz right away.By the time I saw him in the examination room, he was as nervous as I everremember seeing a patient. He appeared ultrathin, gray around his temples, withpiercing eyes.\"The report says there's a nodule there,\" I said. \"We have to biopsy it. Butit's small. And there are no swollen lymph nodes. It may well not be cancer. Ifit is, worst-case scenario, we should be able to operate on it and cure you.\"\"I want to know as soon as possible,\" he said, squeezing his ears and scratchingthe sides of his face, a gesture that conveyedFALSE ALARMextreme nervousness. He squirmed on the examination table. I performed a limitedexamination, as I'd just seen him a few weeks before. I invited him into mycorner consultation room, a sanctum with walls of white brick and many windows.Mr. Azziz seemed to relax somewhat as he sank into the soft blue leather of mycouch, as if the news couldn't get any worse in here.I decided to show the CT scan to my office mate, \"Dr. Madison.\" A prominentpulmonologist, he didn't accept Mr. Azziz's managed care insurance, but he wasalways willing to give me his opinion on an X-ray or CT scan.He crisply snapped the scan up onto his view box. This type of doctorlyprecision and familiarity with potential cancers could frighten a patient if hesaw it. The report already had the words \"suspicious for a bronchogenicneoplasm\" written on it. The radiologist had pronounced sentence on a man he'dnever met. Such an anonymous practice helps provoke patient panic.A great diagnostician and a feeling physician, my office partner always lookedfor nuances. He analyzed all the possibilities, reluctant to jump to aconclusion at this stage. \"It could be cancer,\" Madison said. \"But it might justbe scar. Needs a biopsy, but it could well be negative.\"I brought this happy news right back to Azziz, and I could see a visible change.He stopped moving his hands back and forth in a purposeless pattern, and now hewiped his sweaty forehead with the back of his sleeve. Madison had introduced atangible hope. We could envision a scenario that didn't involve cancer orrequire surgery. Cancer gave mortality a name and a timetable, but a negativeresult would return mortality to the abstract.Still, as he rose to go, I could almost feel the animal fear welling up like anunstoppable current that would not ebb.We both pressed to know the answer as soon as we could. Pushing hard pastimpassive clerks and loaded appointment schedules and the antagonistic world ofmanaged care medicine, I gave this man all the priority and VIP status I couldmuster, internally with my staff and externally with other staffs. I could sensehis helpless-OUR CULTURE OF WORRYness, his guilt over his years of smoking, putting his three children at risk ofa fatherless future.He was overwhelmed by the mushrooming fear of his illness. He was under thecontrol of this fear, and he could only hope to defeat it with the knowledgethat the cancer wasn't there, couldn't be there, because the tissue itself saidit wasn't true.The degree of his worry was tied to imagining what he might feel if the cancerwas there. Even if the surgery cured it and he faced only the specter of thecancer's returning, the fear would recur first. In Azziz's case, fear would bemuch more difficult to control than cancer. If there was a positive aspect tothis fear, it was that Azziz would be too frightened to ever smoke again.Azziz was lucky in one respect—medical testing would lead to a definite answer.Many times the patient is kept in limbo; for example, an MRI of the brain mightshow some signal abnormalities that could indicate multiple sclerosis. What is adoctor supposed to tell a patient who goes for an MRI because of a headache andcomes back with a result that could mean she has this stigmatizing, disablingdisease? Sometimes the technology increases the uncertainty. Some patients haveto live under the shroud of worry that comes with a possible diagnosis.For Azziz, at least, a definitive answer would be forthcoming, though now thathis illusion of health had been disrupted, his worry was bound to persist.Two weeks later, when he returned to my office, I was amazed to discover that hestill hadn't had the biopsy. He'd found a pulmonologist who accepted hisinsurance, and this doctor had suggested a PET scan first to sense activity inthe nodule before doing the biopsy. He'd also done a skin test for tuberculosisthat turned out to be positive. Apparently the lung doctor, \"Dr. Laby,\" had saidthe nodule could be a scar from tuberculosis rather than cancer. This waspotentially good news, but Azziz seemed too worried to consider it. Azziz waspicking up stray comments from his growing ensemble of doctors, and he wastrying to put them together in some kind of order that would predict his future.FALSE ALARMInstead of being reassured, he was more confused and frightened. He stuck outhis arm and pointed to the cherry-red spot in the center, which was the positiveskin test for TB. \"Do I have TB too?\" he asked. \"Should I be treated for it?Wear a mask?\"We bypassed the examination room—I decided he had had enough examinations forthe time being—and sat in my consultation room. He leaned forward on the couchacross from me. Each new piece of information made him question how all thepieces fit together. In order to gain that elusive perspective as he obsessedover the potentially devastating illness, he had to hear the facts in a certainorder, like the combination to a vault.Dr. Laby, by being thorough and careful, had unintentionally alarmed Azzizfurther. Each new sophisticated test created another reason to worry, and delayonly allowed the patient's fear to grow.\"You do not have active tuberculosis,\" I said.Azziz smiled, glad there was something he didn't have.A week later, my assistant placed the PET scan report on my desk with a messageto call Azziz. I hesitated, not wanting to convey results via the telephone.Personal contact between doctor and patient helps a patient to put news inperspective instead of panicking. The more impersonal the communication, themore fear is transmitted along with the message.But sometimes if I request a face-to-face discussion, the patient immediatelyassumes the worst. This approach had already backfired with Azziz. Some patientsprefer to communicate by e-mail, but e-mail is not the place for seriousresults. I decided to try the telephone this time.\"Mr. Azziz, I have the results of your PET scan. The area of the nodule is a hotarea.\"\"What does this mean?\"\"It means it's not a scar. Something's going on there.\" \"What could it be?\"\"It could be a tumor. But it's very small. It can be removed,\" I said. Silence.OUR CULTURE OF WORRYWithout the help of facial expressions and a calm demeanor, it was difficult forme to convey the concept of \"curable\" and have it outweigh the concept of\"tumor.\" I found I couldn't alleviate his nervousness over the phone as well asI could in person.\"I can't sleep,\" he said.\"Would you like a sleeping pill?\"\"Okay,\" he said, sighing. \"I'm going for the needle biopsy Thursday.\" There wereno tests left to delay the biopsy, no more doctors to see.The next time I heard from him was when he called from the waiting room beforehis biopsy.\"I've waited three hours already, and the doctor isn't here, but his partnershowed up and wanted to do the biopsy. I sent him away. What should I do? ShouldI go home?\"I urged Azziz to let the second doctor do the procedure. His ambivalence aboutwho performed it seemed another manifestation of his worry. He was trying tocontrol his fear by creating more choices for himself.He later described the radiologist as unsmiling behind a paper mask and gown.Mr. Azziz said he felt at the time that the doctor's unsympathetic posture wasanother indication that a cancer diagnosis was in the offing.Rather than allowing the patient to succumb to premonitions or speculations thatstoke the amygdala, it is important for a physician to have a strategy fordealing with the specter of cancer. This strategy must be based on a reasonedassessment of the facts, since most patients become more frightened if theythink you are deceiving them.\"Dr. Yang,\" the cytologist (an expert in cells), called me with the results twodays after the biopsy was taken. It was two hours before the start of YomKippur, the Jewish day of atonement. \"It's squamous cell carcinoma of the lung,\"he said.Squamous cancer meant skin cells in the lung gone berserk.There was no good way to deliver bad news. I wondered ifFALSE ALARMAzziz, who was religious, mighthave preferred to know his fate as he prayed forforgiveness on Yom Kippur. Still, I decided to wait to tell him until after theholiday so that I could have a plan in place when I spoke with him.On Tuesday, when Azziz leaned across from me in my consultation room, he seemedstrangely detached, rather than expectant.\"I have the results,\" I began. \"You do have a small cancer, but it's contained,it hasn't spread, it's curable by surgery.\"\"I know,\" he replied. \"Dr. Laby called me with the results this morning.\"\"Laby?\"\"Said he recommended surgery. Said he was happy that the tumor hadn't spread.Said I should go for chemotherapy afterwards just as an insurance policy.\"Laby had charged to center stage before I could get there. He was the head ofour hospital's end-of-life team, and he was used to facing cancer. He was abullish doctor, but he was also highly skilled and responsible.\"Knowing made me feel better,\" Azziz said. \"Imagining was far worse thanknowing.\"The knowledge that your future lies in a computerized scan or a tissue resultcan cause a welling up of uncontrollable panic. But when the definitive answercomes, the mystery is gone, which is for some the worst part. Unfortunately,fear of death remains a primary focus even in cancer that can be cured bysurgery.Azziz had come to this office visit with multiple printouts, charts, andinformation from various lung cancer Web sites. He knew the exact survivalstatistics and the worst-case scenario for his particular pathology. He wasfully plugged in to our contemporary culture of worry.\"How do I know it won't come back?\" he said, already seeing past the surgery tohis future worry.\"This is squamous cell. A skin type that's also found in the lung. It tends tostay local and not spread.\"OUR CULTURE OF WORRYI drew a picture of the lungs and showed his lesion perched atop the right lung,which had three lobes, whereas the left had only two. I told him that after theright upper lobe was removed, the remaining two lobes would expand over severalmonths, and he would get almost all of his lung capacity back. I felt like a drytextbook, but he nodded slowly, contemplating, seeming partly reassured by thefactoids and by the picture.\"Will I always need monitoring?\"\"We'll continue to scan you, every six months at first, and then every year.\"Azziz told me he'd rather not go to New York University for his surgery, becauseof his miserable three-hour wait for the needle biopsy. I was unable to convincehim that the inconvenience and confusion could happen anywhere, in any hospital.The most important things about the biopsy were that they'd gotten a goodsample, the pathology had come back quickly, and the scans had shown limiteddisease.\"But it was chaos there,\" he said. \"Some people were hanging out while otherswere mourning. People in wheelchairs and stretchers were in the hallways, andaround them staff were laughing and joking. I didn't feel confident they wouldreally send you my results and not mix them up with someone else's.\"But Azziz was not reasoning out the role the hospital had actually played insussing out his cancer. Disarray and disorganization make patients more fearful.He was attributing to New York University a greater threat potential than Ibelieved it had. This was all tied in with his emotional response to the news.His fear was deep and primitive, already verging on fight or flight. He couldn'treason through the actual risks presented by his cancer. He was consumed by thefear of death that cancer brings to many patients.What stayed in Azziz's mind even after the good news of no spread was the threatof danger rather than the hope for cure. He remained on the alert. His fearwouldn't shut off. Instead of focusing on how to get better, he continued tocollect informationFALSE ALARMabout how he might get worse, drawn from an interwoven network of alarming factsdisseminated by the media.I accepted his choice to leave NYU. Just as allowing a trapped animal to choosea possible path of escape may diminish its terror, so with humans regainingcontrol in life-or-death situations is a way to channel primitive fear.Azziz was going to go uptown to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Hewould have his surgery and his chemotherapy there. Reputation didn't ensureoutcome, but it made Azziz feel slightly more comfortable.We would keep in touch by phone, and he would return to see me two weeks afterthe surgery. We shook hands and hugged before he left.A Healthy Patient's WorryAs soon as Azziz left the office, I encountered another worried patient. \"NellyFoster\" had been my patient for eight years, and I rarely treated her foranything beyond the muscle soreness that came from running the New York Citymarathon.Occasionally, she would call me for bronchitis, and I would prescribe anantibiotic. Like many American doctors, I sometimes tend to overprescribeantibiotics because of a placebo effect. There could be bacteria behind thecoughing, but antibiotics also have a calming influence. Many patients arerelieved by the doctor's taking action on their behalf.Nelly was a patient who could not effectively use reason to diminish her fears.Nor did her extensive physical exercise routine help alleviate her concerns asit did for so many other patients. For Nelly, her worries required frequentattention and were out of proportion to the real risk of physical disease. Sheusually responded to large doses of my reassurance in addition to the occasionalantibiotic.This time, Nelly Foster was in a panic. She had been in to see me once weeklyfor the past three weeks. On the first visit she said sheOUR CULTURE OF WORRYwas so overcome with coughing and heavy breathing at night that she waspetrified she might stop breathing altogether.I'd diagnosed seasonal allergy plus a sinus infection, but antihistamines,antibiotics, steam, and a humidifier hadn't done the trick. On the second visitI prescribed a decongestant and a steroid nasal spray and arranged for her tosee an allergist. Now she was back again, still overcome with worry, shouting atme in the examination room that the allergist had done nothing and that the onlything that helped her was the Robitussin the pharmacist had wisely offered.But there was a greater agenda for Nelly Foster. She was getting married thefollowing week, at the age of forty-seven, for the first time, to a man namedEarl. Over the years that I'd taken care of her, she'd shared with me her desireto become pregnant even as her menstrual cycle waned. By the time she met Earlit was almost too late, and he, a veteran of one childless marriage already,said he didn't think he wanted children.I mark my life by the milestones in my patients' lives, and now Nelly was comingto see me, not with child news, but with marriage news. A small ceremony was setfor the following week, and I suddenly realized that Nelly's upcoming weddinghad evoked feelings of grief over being childless. This marriage meant leavingbehind for good her dream of having children.When she acknowledged her commitment to Earl, she added that she was starting tofeel better physically. She no longer felt like she would stop breathing in themiddle of the night.As much as treating her congestion, I realized I was performing a ritual ofmedical clearance for the next phase in her life. Each milestone is a marker onthe road to a patient's death. For Nelly, these fears between milestonesmanifested themselves as nervous complaints.No matter what a doctor does to counter the primary fear of illness and death,unmitigated fear can still take root. Uncertainty over illness is directlyconnected to a patient's fear of death. We humans have an instinctive fear ofdeath, to which we add an awareness of death that easily overwhelms our abilityto assessFALSE ALARMrisk. Because of the power of this awareness, it is helpful if we can learn notto be afraid of diseases that don't directly threaten us.Fear Becomes the RiskMy nurse informed me that there was a new patient in my examination room. Hisname was \"Donald Tribune,\" and he said he was the owner of a taxi company.He had a raspy voice from many years of smoking three packs a day. He had beenavoiding doctors for the past five years since an internist handed him a CT scanreport of his lungs that mentioned the possibility of cancer but also read, \"Nodiscernible mass.\" Instead of repeating the scan in a few months the way thedoctor had suggested, Tribune ran away, keeping the report in a back pocket andworrying that he was going to die at any time.Tribune also kept a list of medications he was supposed to take but never did.As opposed to Nelly Foster, who was comforted by pills, for Tribune, medicineswere reminders that good health was just an illusion.Tribune sat in my consultation room right where Azziz had sat and began to weepwhen I told him that he might not have cancer. For five years he had lived withthe fear while continuing to smoke at the same time. The X-ray taken in myoffice, like the previous CT scan, showed the scars of the smoke but nodiscernible mass.We developed a rapport, and he decided to go for a new CT scan. The results cameback a week later and confirmed no cancer.Death by FearThe end of this story is not a happy one. When fear becomes its own malignantdisease, it can be as difficult to contain as any aggressive virus ortissue-transforming tumor.Mr. Tribune remained so nervous despite his good news that his blood pressurerose. The original CT scan had primed his fear pump and kept him feelingchronically on the verge of catastro-OUR CULTURE OF WORRYphe. He was anxious most of the time but wouldn't take medicine for anxiety, andhe wouldn't see a psychotherapist. Finally, on one of his most anxious days, hisblood pressure rose out of control— and with no one there to help him, heexperienced a sudden bleed into his head and died.PLAYING POLITICS WITH FEARBush, it's now clear, intends to run a campaign based on fear. And for me, atleast, it's working: Thinking about what these people will do if they solidifytheir grip on power makes me very, very afraid.—Paul Krugman, New York Times, September 3, 2004Nervous anticipation is making emotional and physical wrecks of some of us wholive in the big cities or obsessively watch the ever-alert cable TV news shows.Politicians on all sides are broadcasting their danger/safety messages via themedia's hype apparatus. This tapping into today's fears for political purposesis perhaps even more dangerous than the terrorist acts themselves.Our post-9/11 fears have become a free-floating anxiety that lacks a specifictarget. We lack information as to where, when, or how, or even whether, thethreat is greater today than it was yesterday. We no longer know who to blame orwho to follow to safety.PLAYING POLITICS WITH FEARThe collateral damage of these fears appears to be many Americans' health. Weare on perpetual alert status, which stokes safety concerns. This process wearsus down and interferes with our ability to function.Meet the PressOn February 7, 2004, George W. Bush sat in the Oval Office and was interviewedby Tim Russert for NBC's Meet the Press. A major topic of discussion, amidstflagging public sentiment that the war in Iraq was necessary in order to somehowdefend our national security, was President Bush's continuing assertion thatSaddam Hussein had possessed weapons of mass destruction along with the abilityto use them against us. During the interview, the president said, \"SaddamHussein was dangerous with weapons. He was a dangerous man in the dangerous partof the world.\"There was certainly a worldwide consensus that Hussein was heinous. There waslittle argument with the fact that he'd authorized torture and brutal killing ofmultitudes in his region. But was he a direct threat to America?Bush's rhetoric was intended to instill the notion that Hussein was theembodiment of the evil our country faced, and that Bush, our president, ourprotector, was the strong leader who had rid the world of the threat before itscapacity to destroy us was realized. Bush said, \"These are people who kill in amoment's notice. . . . When we see a threat we deal with a threat because theybecome imminent. . . . Saddam Hussein was a danger to America. ... As presidentof the United States, my most solemn responsibility is to keep this countrysafe.\"How many people tried to envision what was actually being suggested here—Saddamsupplying the terrorists with a large stash of chemical or biological weaponsthat would be smuggled here undetected, culminating in a drone plane flying fromoffshore to deliver its payload unobserved, with the wind blowing in just theright direction?FALSE ALARMBut in reality chemical and biological weapons are effective WMDs only in anextreme worst-case scenario. Under most circumstances they would actually beWSDs, weapons of some destruction, still hardly comforting, but a more accurateterm.Nevertheless, the rhetoric of protection continued. As Bush said on Meet thePress , \"The war against terrorists is a war against individuals who hide incaves in remote parts of the world, individuals who have these kind of shadowynetworks, individuals who deal with rogue nations.\"Notice how the terrorist description merged with the description of Saddam andhis henchmen. If the public believed there was a single danger, embodied in Iraqand its tentacles, then the president would have been justified in sending ourtroops over there to protect us. In taking this strong stand, he was echoing theposition taken by prior presidents, specifically Abraham Lincoln and FranklinRoosevelt, who were reelected based on a promise to protect us from dangers.To continue selling the war, the Bush administration, like both Democrats andRepublicans before it, kept generating fear.The same kind of fearmongering was used in the overall fight against terror. Asthe years elapsed since September 11, 2001, bin Laden and his al-Qaeda networkremained a primary justification for an elaborate world war on terror.The ultimate argument was put forth by Harvard professor Michael Ignatieff inhis book The Lesser Evil Unless we extinguish these terrorists now, the argumentwent, they could mushroom into nuclear-weapon-wielding menaces who could blow upour cities. Isn't it a small price to give up some liberties now rather thanface an ineradicable danger later on?The answer to this is no, if one believes that we can't allow fear to controlus. Despite terrorism, the risk to the individual remains quite low.Since it is difficult to actually quantify the real risk of disaster, it is easyfor politicians to manipulate the public based on fear of the unknown or theseworst-case scenarios. Time after time, the far-PLAYING POLITICS WITH FEARreaching fear and an increased sense of vulnerability tied to the World TradeCenter attack were used by the Bush administration in its public cry to protectus. Time after time, coached by our leaders, we personalized risks that wereremote.Our Protectors from What?While drawing our attention to these unlikely dangers, at the same time thegovernment revealed a porous safety net, which automatically spread more fear.As Robert Reich wrote in the American Prospect in August 2004, \"America'sintelligence system failed to see terrorist threats coming from al-Qaeda priorto September 11 that should have been evident, and then, after 9/11, sawterrorist threats coming from Iraq that didn't exist. A system that doesn't warnof real threats and does warn of unreal ones is broken.\"The Bush administration refused to properly police and regulate certainpotential targets such as chemical plants (among other big-money specialinterests). A 2002 Brookings Institution study, as well as a GovernmentAccountability Office report, identified security at chemical plants as beingunderaddressed. The Brookings report held that chemical plants were not\"adequately protected against terrorist attack.\" The GAO warned in March 2003that \"no one has comprehensively assessed the security of chemical facilities.\"Meanwhile, administration lawyers blocked efforts by the EPA to beef up securityat chemical plants.Bush and his team directed us away from these potential dangers involvingprivate interest groups and toward those that were said to apply to our sense ofpersonal safety, suggesting that our way of life, our \"freedom,\" was underattack. The Bush wars and the associated rhetoric were supposedly a defense ofthat freedom.The Fear CampaignFear became a major theme of the 2004 presidential campaign. As Frank Rich wrotein the New York Times on July 25, 2004, \"InFALSE ALARMthe fear game, the Democrats are the visiting team, playing at a seriousdisadvantage. Out of power, they can't suit up officials at will to go on camerato scare us.\" They did the next best thing by nominating a war hero, playingthis credential for all it was worth, while the Republicans seemed to becounting on the historically proven paradox that the less safe we felt, the morelikely we would be to stick with a familiar face come Election Day. And even forthose who claimed they wanted someone different, judging from Kerry'sendorsement of the war on terror and Iraq, there was no indication thatfearmongering would have been less prevalent in a Kerry administration.\"The leitmotif of the 2004 election is fear,\" John Harwood wrote in the WallStreet Journal on September 1, 2004. While Republicans were promoting Bush asthe securer of safety and denigrating Kerry as \"unfit for command,\" Democrats inturn were warning of the danger of another four years with Bush, especially withregard to civil liberties. The American Prospect, a leading reflector of liberalDemocratic sentiment, was running covers depicting an elephant's trunk aroundthe neck of the Statue of Liberty, and labeling Bush \"the Most DangerousPresident Ever.\"The overall effect of this back-and-forth fearmongering was to make the publicfeel even more unsafe.The perpetual promulgation of worst-case scenarios causes unnecessary panic. Inthe political context it is clear that this panic can be used both to controland to rally support. In Bush's famous speech to the nation on March 17, 2003,giving Hussein forty-eight hours to get out of town, Bush said, \"The danger isclear: using chemical, biological, or, one day, nuclear weapons, obtained withthe help of Iraq, the terrorists could . . . kill thousands or hundreds ofthousands of innocent people in our country.\"How the Government Benefits from FearA year later, in February 2004, days before Bush's Meet the Press interview withTim Russert, Al Gore, casting himself as a non-PLAYING POLITICS WITH FEARalarmist among Democrats, gave the keynote speech at the three-day conference onfear at New School University. While Bush was getting ready to project hisprotector image to millions via Russert, Gore spoke to mere hundreds about howfear was used as rhetoric to help politicians like Bush stay in office.Gore began by stating that the goal of terrorists was to cause a wave of fearout of proportion to the true danger. \"Terrorism, after all, is the ultimatemisuse of fear for political ends. Indeed, its specific goal is to distort thepolitical reality of a nation by creating fear in the general population that ishugely disproportionate to the actual danger the terrorists are capable ofposing.\"Gore continued with an indictment of how Bush's rush to war was itself a form ofterrorism. \"President Bush and his administration have been force-feeding theAmerican people a grossly exaggerated fear of Iraq that was hugelydisproportionate to the actual danger posed by Iraq.\"His former woodenness gone, Gore weighed his words carefully and hammered themout to the rapt audience that filled the auditorium or watched him from videoscreens in nearby rooms. He provided historical perspective, showing how fear ofterrorists rather than from terrorists had been used throughout American historyto justify restrictions of our liberties. Examples included the Alien andSedition Acts of 1798, the internment of Japanese Americans in World War II, andthe McCarthy abuses of the Cold War.As former vice president Gore's talk drew to a conclusion, he provided a visionof hope that might free us from the sense of capitulation that fear politicsdemanded from us. He said, \"There are only the politics of fear and the politicsof trust. One says: 'You are encircled by monstrous dangers. Give us power ov<\"ryour freedom so we may protect you.' The other says: The world is a baffling andhazardous place, but it can be shaped to the will of men.'\"FALSE ALARMWhen Fear Grabs the HeadlinesThe following morning, the fear conference reconvened in the same auditorium.This time there was a panel that included Joseph Ledoux, Barry Glassner, aprofessor of sociology at the University of Southern California and the authorof The Culture of Fear , and Tom Pyszczynski.Barry Glassner was the speaker just before Dr. Pyszczynski, and whereasPyszczynski described the essential importance of culture to house and sublimateour fears, Glassner went to extensive lengths to show that ours was a culture ofdeception, in which we were misdirected to the wrong dangers. If culture wascrucial to reassure us, the culture of deception could make us more afraid.Glassner, appearing youthful with a full head of black curls and thick blackretro glasses, said that we live in the safest times in human history and thatwe are being manipulated by fear unnecessarily. Said Glassner, \"Crime ratesplunge, while surveys show Americans think crime rates are rising. At a timewhen people are living longer and healthier, people are worried about iffyillnesses.\" The media focus on particular aspects of a problem, inflating anddistorting it until the audience has internalized the experience and considersthe reported danger an accepted fact.Glassner's book focused on the 1990s, and though his conclusions were applicableto the post-9/11 period, there has been an important change since then. Americansociety feels more vulnerable, not so much because of 9/11 itself as because ofthe extensive media coverage of it. The mushrooming of cable news coverage since9/11 has added an important amplifier to the problem.Amplification has been used repeatedly to hype potential contagions in thepost-9/11 world, beginning with anthrax, in which the free-floating anxiety of9/11 was transferred to a hysterical fear of our mail.The fear apparatus was less pervasive before 9/11, though it was growing in thatperiod. Said Glassner, \"Between 1990 and 1998, the murder rate decreased by 20percent, while murder stories onPLAYING POLITICS WITH FEARmedia newscasts increased by 600 percent (not even counting O. J. Simpson).Isolated incidents are treated as trends. Fearmon-gering focused on youthviolence. In the 1980s and '90s, politicians and journalists acted as if justabout every young American was a potential mass murderer, despite the actualdecrease in murders. In 1996 and '97, fear was tied to school violence—WilliamBennett called it the violence of 'super predators.' Yet urban crime continuedto drop, so the media was finally compelled to change its jargon to talk aboutisolated murders in suburban and rural areas. But three times more kids werekilled by lightning than violence. The Columbine murders were unprecedented, butfor twelve months before there was nothing. Less than 1 percent of homicidesoccur in or around schools.\"Media obsession not only misinforms but also diverts attention from the realdangers. As Glassner pointed out, though the murder rate was decreasing in the1990s, at the same time guns were responsible for an increasing percentage ofmurders. Guns were more readily available, and more and more people had them. Ofcourse, the National Rifle Association tried to block widespread awareness ofthis fact, and the media enabled this misdirection because bald statisticsaren't as sexy as the narrative of an individual attack.Misdirection means ignoring the fact that millions don't have health insuranceand millions are malnourished. Glassner said, \"Mad cow is only a tiny risk. Only150 deaths compared to other food borne illnesses. The media misdirects us awayfrom 500,000 cases of salmonella food poisoning. They use an isolated incidentto wrongly profess a trend.\"Leaders create fear around their central issues, making them seem more urgentthan the things they're less interested in. Republicans create fear by sayingSocial Security will go bankrupt if they aren't allowed ro fix it, and Democratscreate fear by saying the Republican plan will just end Social Securityaltogether. Democrats create fear of guns, and Republicans tap into a fear thatthe government will take guns away from law-abiding citizens. DemocratsFALSE ALARMpersuade people that Republicans will take away civil liberties, and then theRepublicans enforce the Patriot Act to protect us, but make people feel afraidto show dissent.Bureaucrats use fear by playing Chicken Little. They can claim at every turnthat a disaster may be coming, thereby keeping their budgets high and avoidingblame should disaster really strike. Department of Homeland Security warningsmay be driven more by the need for higher congressional appropriations andself-justification in case of an attack, rather than actually preventing orminimizing an attack.Our ProtectorOn December 21, 2003, four days before Christmas, Tom Ridge, who served ashomeland security secretary during Bush's first term, had raised the terroralert status back to orange, which meant a high risk of a terrorist attack overthe remainder of the holiday season in the United States. There were severalreasons given for this announcement: the increased buzz and threats circulatingamong al-Qaeda members, the fact that this terrorist group tended to strike onan every-other-year basis, plus the logic that we were more vulnerable as acountry with increased travel taking place during the holiday season.Along with this announcement came the usual disclaimer—the MSNBC headline anchorsaid it was intended not to spread fear but to encourage preparation. Somehow wewould be sending a message back to al-Qaeda that we were ready for them.But no one out on the streets really knew how to conceptualize this. Wasal-Qaeda coming? When and where? The alert had been raised many times, but manyof us didn't know how to respond. We had gotten used to the warnings, but thepossibility of an attack could still cause some nervousness.Since 9/11, many of us have become more apprehensive. Like Dr. Sabban's rats,once alerted, we are more easily frightened a second time, or a third. Ofcourse, worrywarts in places like IdahoPLAYING POLITICS WITH FEARand Montana don't have New York and Washington's sense of vulnerability to beginwith, no matter how much cable news they watch.Many in the United States had a false sense of security before 9/11. With theexception of the War of 1812, our continent had never been invaded while theAmerican flag flew over it. The 9/11 attacks happened suddenly and opened us upto feelings of vulnerability that countries like Russia and Israel were moreaccustomed to. Over time, even if we gain a better perspective and learn toredefine our personal risk as low, still, the worldwide interconnection of ourmedia outlets via satellite and Internet practically assures that the bug dujour, or the scare of the moment, will instantly escalate into worldwide concernvia the media megaphone.The sense of fear in the United States today seems greater than at the height ofthe Cold War, when the Soviet Union was a more tangible threat, with an enormousarsenal of nuclear weapons aimed at us.Why? The greatest reason for the change is the growing fracturing and parcelingof information into hyped media sound bites. No matter how safe we are, all weneed to hear is the word danger or threat, and the cycle of worry starts. Whenone cycle is extinguished, another one takes its place.In the post-9/11 world, the only cable station that doesn't scare us is thecartoon channel, which lacks headlines or news updates of any kind. However, inJanuary 2004, I even noted on the cartoon channel a shift in the wrongdirection, when \"Grandpa\" on Hey, Arnold! told the other characters that they'dbetter \"watch out for weapons of mass destruction.\"Safety SpeakThe New York Police Department sent a memo to New York University Medical Centeron December 23, 2003. It was filled with the kinds of warnings quickly becomingubiquitous in New YorkFALSE ALARMCity. It was the new safety speak. It included sage advice on how to be on thelookout for a terrorist. The criteria for a suspected terrorist included someonewho wore baggy clothing or who exhibited nervousness or extreme concentration,tunnel vision or singular determination, and perspiration. At NYU MedicalCenter, this description might fit a typical medical student.Hyperattention to security and danger profiling spreads more worry than comfort,and there is no evidence that it increases actual safety one iota.New Year's Eve 2003With the holiday season approaching, terrorism fears were once again hyped.Homeland Security Secretary Ridge announced that he had good information that anattack was imminent, and we were back on orange alert nationwide. Here in NewYork City, we had never left orange, and we had long been used to seeing policewith sniffing dogs and even National Guardsmen in combat fatigues at theentrances to our tunnels and bridges.On Christmas Day 2003, Eric Lichtblau and Craig Smith of the New York Timesreported that officials were tightening airport security from Paris to LosAngeles. CNN advised its viewers to go about their usual holiday plans while atthe same time reporting that terrorists might once again attack a prominent U.S.target by hijacking an airplane.In France, Air France canceled six flights between Paris and Los Angeles at theurging of United States officials, who said they suspected that up to ahalf-dozen passengers on the flights had \"links to terrorism.\" In Chicago,officials imposed flight restrictions over downtown at the request of themayor's office, blocking small aircraft below three thousand feet for fear theSears Tower might be hit. Officials at Los Angeles International Airport bannedpassengers from being picked up or dropped off at the terminal curb. Theintelligence agencies were reportedly most concerned about flights originatingin France and Mexico based on terrorism intel-PLAYING POLITICS WITH FEARligence, or chatter, gleaned from electronic spying as well as informants.Jet fighters patrolled our skies and others were on alert, but rather than makeus feel safer, it caused many of us to worry.On December 31, Flight 490 from Mexico to the United States was canceled becauseAmerican officials felt it might be the target of an attack, and then on NewYear's Day, British Airways Flight 223, which was scheduled to embark for DullesAirport in Washington, D.C., was canceled after British government officialswarned the airline of security concerns, according to the New York Times. Thissame flight had been the subject of concern a day earlier, when it wasaccompanied to Dulles by F-16s, and the passengers were questioned upon landing.Again on Friday, January 2, 2004, Flight 223 was canceled and kept on the groundin London.On New Year's Eve, I was in Fort Lauderdale with my wife and two young children.We were supposed to depart for New York's LaGuardia airport at 8:30 p.m., butthe plane was held in Boston for \"security reasons.\" We were assigned anotherplane but had to wait for the pilots to arrive from Boston to fly us to NewYork. The Boston plane finally arrived at 11:15 p.m., but even after we boardedthe new plane, it was held until after midnight before departing. We were toldthat we were still waiting for the pilots, though I had seen them come off theBoston plane. It was clear to me—as well as to several other passengers—that wewere being held on the ground until after midnight while New York was beingwatched.This type of precaution, without being told the reasons behind it or theinformation that the government was acting on, caused a hum of nervousness topervade airports everywhere on New Year's Eve. Unease and uncertainty caused usto be afraid.Our government wanted its citizens to know that it was protecting us. But theway the information was being parceled out by the government followed by thejarring media announcements made us worry automatically. And the mure weworried, the more ourFALSE ALARMleaders maintained that we needed them to protect us from unseen dangers.No matter what the reason for the alerts, they made us worry far more than weneeded to in order to protect ourselves. We could ignore them, but we couldnever stop worrying entirely once the first fight-or-flight response had beentriggered.PreparationsIn early 2004, I discussed our readiness for terrorism with my neighbor Dr. LeonPachter, the head of the trauma service at New York University and Bellevue. Hehad stood outside Bellevue with me on September 11, 2001, waiting for thepotential survivors who never came, and he had since volunteered his time tohelp organize an emergency response system in New York City.\"Forget it,\" he said. \"Since September 11, there's been no real preparation.Doctors and so-called first responders are no more organized now than they wereback then.\"I shook my head. First the government and the media exaggerate a potentialthreat; then they try to show that they are protecting us from it; then wediscover that the protection is faulty, and we become even more afraid.It was a good thing that Dr. Pachter's comments weren't publicized. If the newsmedia got hold of quotes like his, it might cause yet another unnecessary panic.Instead, the New York Times headlined the opposite news on February 15, 2004,claiming that \"New York Police Take Broad Steps in Facing Terror.\" I was moreinclined to believe Pachter, especially since the Times was using mostly unnamedsources. This article attempted to show how extensive preparations were beingmade by the police in conjunction with \"city health officials\" and \"federalauthorities.\"Training reportedly involved potential plans to board cruise ships, and therewas a plan in the works to test the city's air forPLAYING POLITICS WITH FEARbiological agents, and to provide antibiotics and vaccines if necessary. Anotherdrill prepared the coroner's office for dealing with corpses contaminated fromchemical weapons.New sophisticated detection devices included a system that would detect thepresence of more than a hundred different viruses or bacteria within forty-fiveminutes. Since poor New York didn't yet have this latest technology, it wasforced to rely in the meantime on Biowatch, a system whereby ten \"nondescriptmonitors\" would \"sniff the air for fifteen lethal pathogens,\" with an alarmingtwenty-four-hour delay for processing results. Old-style radiation detectorswere reportedly being used throughout the city. Two hundred distribution centerswere also being planned so that as many as eight million people could receiveemergency treatment in five to ten days' time, relying on the federal stockpileof vaccines and drugs. If a quarantine should prove necessary, city healthofficials were ready \"to persuade New Yorkers exposed to a deadly infectiouspathogen to stay at home.\"But this lavish outdated display—even if it actually existed— was likely to beof little use. These science-fictionesque measures were designed for an almostinconceivable worst-case scenario. Instead of feeling protected, people I knewwho read the Times article immediately broke into a cold sweat.Old and Recurrent ThreatsOn Monday, August 2, 2004, a terror alert was issued that financial centers insome of our major cities, including New York, were under direct threat byal-Qaeda. Police presence increased visibly, traffic thickened, and peopleeverywhere wondered whether they were about to be attacked. President Bushpredictably announced, \"We are a country in danger. We are doing everything wecan to confront this danger.\"The alert was based on the computer files and related information uncoveredfollowing the arrest of an al-Qaeda operative in Pakistan.FALSE ALARMBy Tuesday it was determined that much of the information released was in factthree or four years old, and there was no evidence that a terror plot wasactually underway.The New York Times, the Washington Post, and other major newspapers, aftersplattering the initial concerns over their front pages on Monday, on Tuesdaysheepishly front-paged the qualifying information. And a Tuesday Times editorialread, \"But it's unfortunate that it is necessary to fight suspicions ofpolitical timing, suspicions the administration has sown by misleading thepublic on security.\"Once again the public appeared to have been thrown into a fight-or-flight modeunnecessarily. Once again, unlike animals, we were transmitting danger signalsbased on abstract information. Abstract risk assessment is an advantage forhumans over animals only as long as we can learn to use it accurately.Agenda-driven communication creates a problem with a basic mechanism such asfear. The al-Qaeda report was overpersonal-ized, the danger perceived was out ofproportion to the real risk, and the fear response was useless or evenmaladaptive.By Wednesday, government officials, including Tom Ridge, the secretary ofhomeland security at the time, tried to salvage the situation by saying thatal-Qaeda took a long time to size up and stalk a potential target. But by thistime, the public imagination was already diverted, though the fear of al-Qaedaremained just below the surface.In fact, in a final preelection ad, the Bush campaign cast the terrorist threatas menacing wolves prowling through a shadowy forest, and tried to capitalizeone last time on our fear. They knew well by this point that our attention hasan on-and-off switch, but our fear does not.DISASTERS: REAL OR IMAGINEDIf they can get you asking the wrong questions, they don't have to worry aboutthe answers.—Thomas PynchonIn August 2003,1 was working in my office in New York City when the lights wentout. The phones went dead too, and I silently counted off the minutes. At firstI thought this might be terrorism. I felt my way along the concrete-walledhallway down seven floors to the lobby of the building, where the doormen werelistening to their battery-powered radio. It soon became clear to them and meand almost everyone in the Northeast that this wasn't any sort of terroristattack, but the mother of all blackouts.I joined the crowd on First Avenue, and the feeling was warm and friendly,camaraderie offsetting fear and worry.Ways to Offset FearSince the blackout was a shared reality and wasn't simply speculative, like somany other hyped thrc its in the wake of 9/11, thereFALSE ALARMwere useful actions to be taken. Certain practical ideas helped people respondcalmly and without panic. The combination of no TV to hype the problem andsimple preparations at home worked to help people stay calm. Here are practicalprecautions that helped many people avoid panic:• It was useful for everyone to have available a land-line telephone that didnot require electricity.• If you weren't feeling well and you couldn't reach your physician, then it wasappropriate to call 911.• Opening the windows was prudent. In a power outage such as this it was wise tokeep well hydrated. You could easily become dehydrated without realizing it. Ifyour water supply was on an electrical pump and went off, you could use the iceand water in your refrigerator for several hours, as long as you avoided openingand closing the door frequently.• It was important to continue taking most regular medicines, especially thosefor heart problems and high blood pressure.Though the blackout of 2003 affected much of the Northeast, and a terroristattack would likely affect only a small part of the population, the sudden civicparalysis during a terrorist attack would probably be far worse. The public maybe stirred to greater hysteria if the full-court media press, includingtelevision and Internet, is available to egg them on. In terrorist attacks,panic is the greatest weapon.The blackout brought out the best in New Yorkers. People calmly shared food andwater on the stoops outside their darkened apartments. Since the blackoutneutralized our TV screens, for once we could not be whipped into a frenzy bytwenty-four-hour cable news reports.Is it a coincidence that a blackout is the only kind of disaster that can't beendlessly dissected on TV? It's hard to come to any conclu-DISASTERS: REAL OR IMAGINEDsion other than that, without the constant news crawl and the breathlessspeculation of news analysts, we just weren't as terrified.Instead of being riveted to a disaster-magnifying TV screen, many of usrediscovered our staircases. Several of my invalid patients who could not usestairs waited patiently in their apartments and wisely rationed their ice andwater, cooling themselves at regular intervals.We learned to distinguish the luxuries from the necessities. Reading bycandlelight in front of an open window, talking with your neighbor—as new habitsgo, these weren't all bad.In my own particular apartment complex, people gathered around the doormen whowere listening to the radio reports and giving us updates whenever we asked.Seeing them automatically take this role reminded me that doorpeople always havehad the comforting role of go-to people.An Organized Response TeamIronically, the power returned to Long Island twelve hours earlier than to manyparts of our powerhouse city. My wife and I collected our young children anddrove the two hours out to our Sag Harbor house, arriving there with our thawingperishables midday on Friday, the second day of the blackout. What we foundthere was a well-organized collection of emergency responders, ready to helpresidents make it through the emergency without excess fear.The Cove Deli, a tick on the odometer past my house, is an old-fashioned placeto go to in Sag Harbor for unspoken comfort on a dark night. Any conveniencestore can offer bright lights, but the bleached white glow, the constantelectrical hum, and the under-aged fidgety cashier who has read too manythrillers hardly offer comfort. The convenience store—because we have seen itthrough the eye of the security camera in too many crime movies and newsreports—is part of the culture of fear.FALSE ALARMIn our Cove Deli the woman behind the counter has bleached her hair half purplewith a streak of melon or mango, and she has tiny rings of silver displayed onearlobes and navel. Yet I feel confident that we can pass the time of day here,and ask about the weather and she'll know. She knows the neighborhood and itspeople, she is calm, and I know that in an emergency she'll know just how to gethold of the fire guys or the police guys or an ambulance. Feeling safe is allabout context. If you were to transplant her into the eerie luminescence of the7-Eleven, the feeling would be lost.The fire department is the basis for a massive premium hike on our homeowner'spolicy because it isn't a paid group. Nevertheless, these firefighters areavailable for community support, they serve pancake breakfasts on Sunday, andthey are razor-sharp responders in an emergency. These men are Sag Harbor's fearguardians, they help everyone feel more secure. It is their old-fashionedquality, not connected to time clocks, that defines them and reassures thecitizens. These groups are an endangered species, though they can still be foundin small towns throughout the country.In Sag Harbor the local oldies radio station, WLNG-FM, occupies a one-storybuilding on the cove. I never thought they were equipped for emergencybroadcasting, but they do have a generator. During the blackout, while the CoveDeli was handing out free coffee and doughnuts, the firetrucks were patrollingthe streets, and the radio station was broadcasting updates every fifteenminutes and telling people how to stay safe.Radio stations have traditionally played a crucial role in informing citizensand defusing panic. Unfortunately, the commercial rush to gobble up localstations and convert everything to centralized broadcasting can undermine thatrole. Of course, not all local-run stations provide calm and not all nationallysyndicated radio causes panic, but the problem of being out of touch with thecommunity that you're supposed to be informing can be disastrous. In January2002 in Minot, North Dakota, a terribleDISASTERS: REAL OR IMAGINEDaccident at a chemical plant released noxious ammonia gas into the air. Peopleholed up in their basements and awaited information about whether it was safe togo oat or not. There was supposed to be an emergency broadcast system in place,but it failed to work. Clear Channel, a national conglomerate, had bought up allthe local stations in Minot, and although spokesmen then and since have deniedculpability, they and only they were responsible for a radio blackout at a timeof great need. The absence of information at a crucial time was so frightening,it was difficult for people in Minot to feel safe after that.Why So Calm?On the second day of the blackout, with the power long restored to Sag Harborand the rest of eastern Long Island, I followed the cable news accounts of thestruggle to return power to the industrial northeast corridor. During the laterstages of the blackout, Con Ed was being asked to parcel out radio sound biteupdates that unreliably estimated when the power might come back on in the partsof New York City that were still affected.I recalled the blackout of 1965, the first of New York's three major blackouts,which was characterized by a ceremonial formality befitting disaster managementin those days. Con Ed was called by its full name, Consolidated Edison, withspokesmen who I imagined wore tight-fitting suits with starched collars, andthere were no sound bites, but rather clear and complete explanations about whatwas happening and when things might improve. Maybe I am romanticizing, but Irecall those radio updates as more comforting. Today's updates are generallyslick and more streamlined. WLNG is the exception.We have gadgeted up to the max—we have so many air conditioners, electricaloutlets, hair dryers, and blowers, we can no longer contemplate the source ofour power. Even our water and our phones are tied into the electrical grid thesedays. Our grid is out of date, it includes old equipment that was built for muchlessFALSE ALARMusage than it gets, but we are .oblivious, loading it up with every device wecan think of. It is as if by controlling our environment completely, we canmaintain our distance from the ultimate fear penetration—mortality recognition.But it is a false comfort. We simulate everlasting life with devices to keepus—artificially— from our fear of death.Ultimately the grim reaper will find us in our climate-controlled cars andhouses.Like many, I was most able to appreciate our country's excessive use of power onthe one day we had to do without it. Power is one of our false crutches. We areafraid to lose it. Given our increasing dependence on energy, one might expectthe sudden loss of electricity to be a focus of our fears. And yet the 2003blackout in the Northeast was met with relative calm. Why? One answer was theabsence of the usual media hype, an important catalyst of panic. Another answerwas that when we were compelled to forgo electricity, many of us learned wedidn't really need it.And this was why we weren't really afraid. The secret to the calm of theblackout was that we found the time to talk to each other and reassure eachother the way we did before the grid took over.Some pundits smartly postulated that we were calm only after we knew this wasn'ta terrorist act. Others insisted that fear fatigue over 9/11 had finally set inand that we were calm during the blackout simply because fear had exhausteditself. But this assertion was wrong. The next several panics would prove thiswasn't the case.The HurricaneIf I am correct that television whips us into a frenzy over the slightestinconvenience, and that TV's absence during the blackout allowed us to return toa more solid and supportive community structure, this theory was also borne outin reverse during the next \"catastrophe,\" a natural one, a month later. Thegreat stormDISASTERS: REAL OR IMAGINEDof September 2003, Hurricane Isabel, only rated a 2 on a scale of 5 by the timeit came inland, whereas Hurricane Floyd, in 1999, was a 5 and did a lot moredamage (over $6 billion in damage compared to $1 billion for Isabel). Yet Floydwasn't perceived with nearly as much panic. Areas that Isabel didn't even touch,such as New York, were cowering in her shadow, because TV news, back in fullthrottle this time, projected an evil menace. Both the forecasting and thereaction to the storm were exaggerated. Weathermen and correspondents appearedworried and were shown being blown about by the wind.This hyperbole was also present in many newspaper accounts, as print andbroadcast media combined to alarm us. Page 2 of the New York Daily News reportedit this way on September 19, 2003: \"Hurricane Isabel raced inland from NorthCarolina last night before weakening to a tropical storm, leaving at least eightpeople dead, more than 2.5 million people without power, some 1,500 planesgrounded and the nation's capital shut down.\"And page 1 of the New York Times on September 20, 2003, reported: \"HurricaneIsabel petered out over Canada last night, leaving a wide scar of destruction:nearly two dozen deaths, flooded cities in Virginia and Maryland, millions ofpeople without power and tens of thousands of fallen trees that punctured roofsand blocked roads from North Carolina to New Jersey.\"\"A wide scar of destruction\" was a hyperbolic phrase that simply didn't fit thefacts, no matter how many people were inconvenienced by the storm. And\"puncture\" was a painful word that a reader could too easily personalize.True, nationwide twenty-three people died because of Isabel, millions werewithout power for several days, and property damage was significant, affectingtens of millions, maybe more. People in the affected areas were right to takeprecautions, especially at a time when information was still evolving.But a comparison between the blackout and the hurricane in the Northeastsuggests that the reaction to the blackout was more orderly and less frenziedprecisely because television itself wasFALSE ALARMblacked out. Not only was the hurricane not a risky storm to many who feared it,but it wasn't even really a hurricane by the time it reached the Northeast. Yetworkers everywhere were going home early, the U.S. Congress had the day off, andthe D.C. subway system was closed.More than a thousand miles away from the storm, my patients were canceling theirappointments for fear of the weather. Yet the Metro section of the Timesreported the next day, \"For all the apocalyptic forecasting, Hurricane Isabelmoved through the New York region with more of a whimper than a bang . . . thefears of extensive flooding that prompted officials to declare emergencies andmuster rescue vehicles for low-lying areas proved groundless.\"Meanwhile, on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, where the storm really didcause some inconvenience, the overreaction was exponentially greater. The localpolice, to encourage recalcitrant citizens to depart, told people to write theirnames on their forearms in permanent marker to make their corpses easy toidentify. They also collected names of next of kin.Hurricane Isabel was personified by the news media as a massive potentialkiller, instead of the unthinking, unfeeling, rain and wind storm it was. It wastoo easy for John Doe on the street to accept the media spin as gospel andbecome unnecessarily frightened. Isabel was part of a fiction constructed by thenews coverage itself. Reporters would seek outside points of view from experts,but these comments were rapidly recast in the context of the larger story ofIsabel, by media definition a great consuming storm.The facts were there to interpret differently: it was downgraded to level 2 bythe time it hit North Carolina, weakened partly by a contrary gust of warm airwhile still at sea. Climbing up the coast, it was quickly reclassified as atropical storm. We saw the new designation, tropical storm, and yet we continuedto worry as the media encouraged this danger perception.Of the twenty-three people who died from Isabel, most were in car accidents, atiny minority challenging the power of the tropicalDISASTERS: REAL OR IMAGINEDstorm. An off-duty policeman in Long Beach, New York, where the storm neverreally took hold, died swimming through strong waves in the middle of the night.It would be more accurate to classify his foolish death as unrelated to Isabel.In serving as an authoritative source of information, while at the same timemagnifying risk, the mainstream media—especially television—prey on ourvulnerabilities and uncertainties, provoking us to be afraid. This is not to saythat the media can't play a positive role in a true disaster. Accuratecontextual forecasting can save many lives. In the wake of a true disaster,accurate reporting can also help people recover, while hype is overpersonalizedand wounds the public psyche. The recent tsunami in Asia was historic in termsof the extensive media coverage of the rescue effort, but it was also magnifiedto the point where people in California and elsewhere expected the next set ofmonster waves to mount their shores at any moment.False EvidenceJoey Reynolds, the host of a late-night talk show on WOR radio in New York, hasanointed fear \"False Evidence Assumed Risk.\" \"Fear,\" he said to me, \"occurs whenyou don't think you can get what you need.\" Reynolds said many people deal withtheir own fear of personal loss by making others afraid in their place. \"And nomatter how inaccurate, the greater the impact, the more powerful the scarerfeels.\"Reynolds is radio's version of the counter person at the deli, and he lullsthousands of anxious insomniacs to sleep every night with his peculiarlullabies. His guests are like guests in his living room, and he serves themfood and coffee as any generous host would.I asked Reynolds if he thought we could become used to this fear over time,become desensitized to it, and evolve into better-balanced human beings despiteour fragmented media-driven lives. He laughed his knowing cackle and said hedidn't see how we could.FALSE ALARMSpinning FearNarratives are employed by the mainstream media to advance a story, embodyingaspects of fiction in order to hold their audiences' attention. These narrativestend to be compatible with others already in circulation. According to BarryGlassner, prior to 2001, a \"sick society\" narrative predominated. In this story,heroes were hard to find, and villains were domestic. The story line wasultimately about the decline of Western civilization.Post-9/11, there was a new narrative. In this story, people were pullingtogether to fight a common enemy, villains were from foreign lands, andAmericans were the object of scorn of the rest of the world. In this narrative,former villains were now portrayed as heroes, including the previouslycriticized fire department and police.By the middle of 2004, the media were growing weary of the new narrative. Thecountry was dividing into factions, no longer pulling together, and our leaderswere once again perceived by many as villains worth discrediting, and Westerncivilization was once again seen as declining.Despite this shift in emphasis, one strategy remained the same throughout allthe narratives: newspapers, television, and radio continued to exaggerate minordangers.FINDING THINGS TO WORRY ABOUTWe are hard-wired in our brains to fear first, think second.—David Ropeik, director of risk communication at the Harvard Center for RiskAnalysisThe risk terrain has changed. As more of our sense of what threatens us comesfrom the news media and the Internet, we lose track of our former guides.Trustworthy mentors who put things in perspective for us have been largelyreplaced by the bright lights of computer and TV screens that offer infofragments, alarming us more often than they reassure. I call this new fearterrain the topography of worry. Go-to people have almost disappeared. We havelost the ability to assess risk. We worry so much about danger that doesn'texist that our ability to judge real danger is impaired. We see terrorists wherethere are none. But the terrorist we should fear the most comes disguised as oneof us, and we cannot recognize him.FALSE ALARMThe Prorer Use of FearIn 1997, Gavin de Becker published The Gift of Fear, a book about how to usefear properly. He described fears that protect. Perhaps most important, hewarned against the destructive power of prolonged states of unremitting fear.\"Far too many people are walking around in a constant state of vigilance, theirintuition misinformed about what really poses danger. It needn't be so. . . .Real fear is a signal intended to be very brief, a mere servant of intuition.\"Some of de Becker's examples are extreme. The experience of being stalked by amurderer, or of being famous and the vulnerable object of adoring fans, is notsomething that most of us can, or should try to, relate to. But many women havetried to break off a relationship only to have the jilted suitor stalk them.\"There's a lesson in real-life stalking cases. The fact that a romantic pursueris relentless doesn't mean you are special—it means he is troubled.\" This kindof fear radar is not hype but protective. If someone in an intimate relationshipfeels intuitively that he or she is at risk, it is often the case, especially ifthe partner has a history of violence. De Becker pointed out that a partner's\"justifications for violence\" and threats are always to be taken seriously.De Becker wrote convincingly that recognizing real danger is the key to realsafety. He told the story of a woman who had just been raped who somehow sensedthat she was about to be killed. De Becker called it a survival signal—when theperpetrator closed the window just when he said he was about to leave, thevictim's unconscious signaled her into a fight-or-flight mode, and she sneakedaway just as he went into her kitchen to find a knife. The closed window was asign that the perpetrator didn't want the noise of the murder to be overheard.Previous to this she had been submissive, controlled by the violence, but withthe closing of the window, her unconscious was alerted. With no time left, sherallied to take back control and escape.De Becker is an expert in telling the difference between \"a real warning andmere words.\" \"If your intuition is informed accu-FINDING THINGS TO WORRY ABOUTrately, the danger signal will sound when it should. If you come to trust thisfact, you'll not only be safer, but it will be possible to live life nearly freeof fear.\"In 2002, in the post-9/11 climate, de Becker wrote a follow-up book: Fear Less.He concluded that despite the terrorist attacks we could still feel safe, inpart by understanding our enemies were not \"superhuman,\" but \"merelyanti-human.\" \"Occasionally effective, to be sure, but our enemies are notpowerful or ubiquitous.\"Many of us tend to think of the world in terms of good guys and bad guys. Badguys help create our fears. Good guys help us feel protected. Unfortunately, ourconcern about bad guys is often blown out of proportion to the real danger theyrepresent.After 9/11, we went through an adjustment period. We recognized that violencecould happen to us. Many of us began to imagine worst-case scenarios involvingweapons and terrorists, or we were handed them by the media. Wrote de Becker,\"But if a person feels fear constantly, there is no signal left for when it'sreally needed. Thus, the person who chooses to worry all the time or topersistently chew on unwarranted fears is actually making himself less safe . .. trusting intuition is the exact opposite of living in fear. When you honorintuitive signals and evaluate them without denial, you can actually relax, evenin these troubled times.\"Post-9/11, the group of people who were covered by the debris of the fallingWorld Trade Center expanded to include practically the entire country, as wewere all bombarded by media images of destruction and fear of further terrorism.This fear was contagious. Many of us vacillated between feelings of disbeliefand panic. Hyped symptoms of posttraumatic stress that included helplessness,numbness, and withdrawal from daily activities lasted for weeks.The TV generation that grew up in America watching Wile £. Coyote zoomunhindered off countless cartoon cliffs in Road-runner episodes, and laterbecame watchers of building-crushing flicks such as The Towering Inferno andIndependence Day, experienced an initial detachment from the real events ofSeptember 11, 2001. To many baby boomers, the balls of fire and the thunderousFALSE ALARMcrash didn't seem real. But as the news media continued their focus, the horrorbegan to sink in, which helped fuel an outpouring of concern and generosity aspeople everywhere banded together. Yet the news coverage also caused countlesspeople who had lost no one to feel vulnerable and afraid. This wasn't trueposttraumatic stress, since most of us hadn't experienced the trauma directly,but many personalized it and felt helpless. It was only over time, by stickingto family, to work, to passions, that we began to live normal lives again.Dr. Rachel Yehuda, an expert on posttraumatic stress, said she thinks westruggled as a society in this period because we felt entitled to live atrauma-free life. We said, \"Why me?\" whereas \"in a previous generation, no onehad the expectation that something wouldn't happen to them—in those days, it was'Why not me?' Previously, no one thought that being exposed to a trauma was thatunusual.\""},{"pageContent":"\"Posttraumatic stress is a mismatch between what we think the world should belike, and what it is really like. We aren't prepared. In a culture where you'reexpecting people to hate you, you let go of it for a lot longer. In Europe, forexample, Jews always had the thought that a certain percentage wouldn't survivebecause of anti-Semitism. There was a lower expectation of peaceful existence,so the trauma of threat was less.\"Dr. Yehuda also indicated that many of our scientists and those who inform us dous a disservice by overdramatizing their concerns. This grandiosity is part ofwhat causes the public to over-perceive risks. \"We scientists can't toleratebeing cogs in a wheel. Technology allows us to look at things we never couldbefore. But we need to learn to be excited by what we do without telling apremature story. We can alarm people unnecessarily. And then we're stuck withour story, right or wrong.\"Assessing RiskWe need to learn how to see risk in perspective, without overreacting toimagined dangers. Unfortunately, there is no consensusFINDING THINGS TO WORRY ABOUTabout what constitutes proper risk assessment or the best way to accomplish it.There is disagreement about who is an expert on risk, and some authors don'ttrust so-called experts at all because of their hidden agendas.Published in 2002, David Ropeik and George Gray's book Risk is a practical guideintended to counter the hysteria caused by inaccurate public health reporting.Like de Becker, these authors believe that \"we live in a dangerous world. Yet itis also a world far safer in many ways than it has ever been. Life expectancy isup. Infant mortality is down. Diseases that only recently were mass killers havebeen all but eradicated. Advances in public health, medicine, environmentalregulation, food safety, and worker protection have dramatically reduced many ofthe major risks we faced just a few decades ago.\"Ropeik and Gray developed a risk meter, a way of converting uncertainty intocalculable risk. This risk meter assesses the likelihood of exposure to apotential danger as well as the consequences if you are one of the unluckyvictims. The list of risks is extensive. Accidents, alcohol, tobacco, andobesity top the list in terms of both prevalence and severity of outcome. On theother end of the spectrum, vaccines are deemed essentially safe, mad cow diseaseis too rare in humans to be a factor, mercury doesn't really affect most people,and pesticides have a minimal impact.The book attempts to reorient the reader. The authors would see dangersdemystified. Their goal was to cut the public loose from hype and decontaminateus from prior misconceptions.But Cass Sunstein, a professor of law at the University of Chicago, distrustsauthorities who approach us with a \"we know what's best for you\" attitude. In2002, Sunstein published the book Risk and Reason, in which he suggested that itis not the expert or official, but the populist/consumer advocate who generallyhas our best interests at heart. Sunstein would likely distrust Ropeik andGray's fear meters as simplistic and too easily politicized, preferring insteadthe judgment of the same consumerFALSE ALARMadvocates that Ropeik and Gray.might see as inaccurate. According to Sunstein,\"Populists insist that the very characterization of risks involves no simple'fact,' ... In the populist view . . . any judgment about risk is subjective ...for populists, ordinary intuitions have normative force.\"Like Ropeik and Gray, Sunstein also observed that information about risk waseasily distorted, but unlike the authors of Risk, Sunstein generally blamed thegovernment. He wrote, \"Public officials know that they might be severelypunished for downplaying a risk that is perceived as serious or for callingattention to a hazard that is perceived as trivial ... to avoid charges ofinsensi-tivity ... he [the public official] may make speeches and promotepolicies that convey deep concern about the very waste spill that he actuallyconsiders harmless.\" The effective politician rides the waves from one createddanger to the next: \"Thus people might be fearful, for a time, about somerisk—shark attacks, or air travel in the aftermath of a disaster—that producesno concern at all after a few months.\"In the 2002 book Risk Communication, Drs. Granger Morgan, Baruch Fischhoff, andtheir coauthors suggested the need to integrate common beliefs with facts aboutrisk. On the surface, this book seems to be an attempt to bring together thefacts of Ropeik and Gray with the public intuition of Sunstein. The people whoinform us need to consider \"how the public intuitively thinks about the risksand . . . which aspects of the scientific literature actually matter to thepublic. Then those topics must be presented in a balanced, credible, andcomprehensive manner.\"If this declaration seems idealistic, it is because it relies on an agenda-freepanel of public-minded experts. But learning to assess risk doesn't simply meanfinding the right expert to listen to. We also have to take responsibility forour own fear meters. As Bruce Schneier, a world-respected security expert, wrotein his 2003 book Beyond Fear, \"When you're living in fear, it's easy to letothers make decisions for you. ... To get beyond fear, you have to startthinking intelligently about the trade-offs you make. YouFINDING THINGS TO WORRY ABOUThave to start evaluating the risks you face.\" Taking responsibility for our ownfear meter sometimes means disregarding public pronouncements of risks, while atother times accepting them.But Schneier was concerned that we can too easily give up our freedom to ablanket authority that promises to handle our risk assessment for us butultimately doesn't make us more secure, in part because this authority may tendto magnify threats. Like Sun-stein, Schneier did not trust the usual experts andofficials to advise us or protect us.Wrote Schneier, \"We are told that we are in graver danger than ever, and that wemust change our lives in drastic and inconvenient ways in order to be secure. Weare told that we must sacrifice privacy and anonymity and accept restrictions onour actions. We are told that the police need new far-reaching investigativepowers, that domestic spying capabilities need to be instituted, and that wemust spy on each other. . . . But the reality is that most of the changes we'rebeing asked to endure won't result in good security. . . . Even in the worstneighborhoods, most people are safe. It's hard to find a terrorist, kidnapper,bank robber, because there simply aren't that many in our society.\"All the authors I have cited here are only partly right. We can't trust our riskexperts because their facts are amplified by the government, the media, andpublic advocates, each depending on different agendas. But this doesn't mean wecan automatically trust our intuition either, which, as de Becker wrote, is toooften \"misinformed.\" Any resolution of this dichotomy between misinformingexperts and misguided intuition must involve retraining in how to recognizedanger.Finding Things to FearOn September 24, 2003, Anne Applebaum addressed the American terrain of worry ina column titled \"Finding Things to Fear\" in the Washington Post. She too wasarguing against the wisdom of our unschooled intuition.FALSE ALARMShe described how we have miscalculated risks in the post-9/11 world because ofour continuing anxiety. \"After Sept. 11, 2001, thousands of people in thiscountry swore off airplanes and began driving cars, apparently believing thatcars are safer. In fact, the number of deaths on U.S. highways in a typicalyear—more than 40,000—is more than double the number of people who have died inall commercial airplane accidents in the past 40 years. To put it differently,the odds of being killed in a terrorist incident in 2002 were 1 in 9 million. Inthat same year, the odds of dying in a traffic accident were about 1 in 7,000.By taking the precaution of not flying, many people died.\"Indeed, we are far safer in America, but we feel more afraid. We Americans havedramatically reduced our risk in every area of life, and our life spans were 60percent longer in 2000 than in 1900. We have thousands of safety devices,including smoke detectors, circuit breakers, and air bags. We are protectedagainst everyday mishaps of all kinds. Yet if our fears aren't real, we inventthem.The flow of information about risk has grown steadily during the same period oftime that we have grown safer. Government officials, scientists, marketers, andthe media use risk as a way to get attention. We tend to believe people who tellus that we are in danger. But when a warning such as an orange alert provesfallacious, we are slow to lose faith in the authority who has warned us. Ittakes several false warnings before we begin to question a source. By that timeit is often too late, as our fear apparatus has already been triggered.The Good Guys—ThenWithout mentors, without people we can trust, we grow more fearful. Doctors areamong the groups of former good guys who have been discredited by our culture ofworry. At the outset of the twenty-first century, patients are frightened by thelatest technologies, but even more so by the impersonal and robotic way medicalinformation is sometimes delivered. In the context of today's fear-FINDING THINGS TO WORRY ABOUTprovoking parceling out of health factoids, a well-informed communicative caringphysician—a throwback to an earlier time in history—can make a big difference incalming fears and providing perspective.The television character Marcus Welby was a paradigm of the kind of physicianI'm referring to, who above all else offered a dose of reassurance andperspective to the dispensing of treatment. It is no accident that the Welby TVshow reruns faded from the screen over the years, and even with the propagationof cable stations, this old medical show is still rarely seen. It is no wonderthat ratings-obsessed TV got rid of Welby for being out-of-date, realizing thattoday's time-constrained doctors have too little in common with the hand-holdersof yesteryear.Marcus Welby, M.D., at the time a very popular medical drama set in middleAmerica, ran from 1969 to 1976 on ABC. Robert Young as Welby was a study inbedside manner. The creased brow of concern, the empathetic pat on the patient'sshoulder, these Welby trademarks delivered the message that a family doctorcould guide a patient caringly through life's crises. Marcus Welby, M.D. was aresponse to the beginning of the technological age. In an era that celebratedthe invention of coronary bypass surgery, a revolutionary procedure that didn'trequire hand-holding, Welby believed in comforting the patient as much as curingthe illness.In a movie that emphasized Welby's obsolescence, The Return of Marcus Welby, in1984, a hospital tried to cut the privileges of its oldest doctors, includingWelby. He argued ineffectively that a patient would be lost among the CTscanners, the MRIs, and the multitude of pills.In the worried post-9/11 world, there was a surge of volun-teerism amongphysicians that brought back memories of the old Welby house-call days.Unfortunately, this return to an era of physician guidance was short-lived, andwe all soon went back to rushing for clipped fees from one worried patient tothe next.But in 2005,1 believe we need to bring back the image of smiling old Doc Welby.In his world, there was less withholding ofFALSE ALARMinformation or ignoring the frightened patient. The doctor battled a puzzlingillness until the diagnosis was made, and the patient was attended to until heor she felt comfortable.The Good Guys—NowAs fear of illness connects directly to our central fear of death, there is acrucial need to comfort patients. But there are many obstacles to overcome. Theprocess promises to get harder the more patients an insurance company expectsdoctors to see in a shorter period of time. And for the patients, there is lesscomfort to be found in the doctor's office.The daily squeeze hit me hardest the morning I saw a likablesixty-eight-year-old patient of mine waving at me through my waiting-roomwindow. I'd been treating him for years, but he didn't have an appointment, andI barely recognized him with his newly bald head, yellowed skin, and shakinghands. My office staff wanted to turn him away because the day's schedule wasalready packed, but I sensed his desperation and made time for him. His cancerwas far more advanced than Azziz's, and in the examination room, he told me thathis oncologist had informed him bluntly that his cancer was incurable and thendismissed him. I was the man's internist, his gatekeeper to the medical world,and he had returned to me—not for expertise, but for simple warmth.I ended up spending an hour with him and told him that he could come in againanytime, with or without an appointment. I would do my best to arrangepalliative or comfort care by speaking with the oncologist or possibly helpingthe patient to change oncologists. Though his prognosis was abysmal, he lookedvisibly calmer for having someone to count on—and I felt good about this—untilthe swelling crowd in the waiting room reminded me that my other patients hadwhat in their eyes were equally important problems and equally urgent claims ona doctor's ever-shrinking time.FINDING THINGS TO WORRY ABOUTNot surprisingly, rushing doctors leads to panicked patients. \"I just want adoctor I can talk to,\" many say.There doesn't seem to be an easy solution. Mark Aaronson, a founding partner ofone of New York's top doctor-defending malpractice law firms, believes that thepressures of managed-care medicine help to create a threatening climate where\"the patient is looked upon, if not as an enemy, then as a potential lawsuit.\"\"What to do about it?\" I asked him.He said, \"You have to create an atmosphere that encourages patients to be openwith you, and where it's not inappropriate to present any problem.\"Struggling with their professional identity, many doctors try to find themselvesin the famed physicians' Hippocratic Oath, which says, in part, \"In every housewhere I come I will enter only for the good of my patients, keeping myself farfrom all intentional ill-doing and all seduction.\" An effective doctor has tomaintain integrity in order to be trusted rather than feared.The Bad Guys—NowThese days, though we are often afraid of people who don't directly threaten us,at the same time, in the rare instance when we encounter someone who is trulydangerous, we may not know how to identify him. With all the unnecessary worrywe experience, there is still no guarantee that the real bad guys won't slip byus. In fact, perhaps if we weren't casting such a wide safety net, we might bemore likely to notice a clear danger signal, like a pilot in training who sayshe doesn't need to know how to land.The good Arthur R. Droba, J.D., M.D., is an internist who performs insurancescreening physicals for the FAA in Sarasota, Florida. He examined the 9/11terrorist leader Mohammed Atta and okayed him to fly. Afterward, he couldn'tremember his infamous patient, though his nurse had heard him say he felt Attawas a \"bad man.\"Droba's friend Arne Kruithof is the forty-year-old director ofFALSE ALARMthe flight school in Sarasota that trained Ziyad Al-Jarrah, one of the hijackersof Flight 93. Kruithof found this Machiavellian pilot-to-be honest, hardworking,well mannered, and intelligent.Al-Jarrah's own father, the minister of social affairs in Lebanon, and hisuncle, the director of a large bank, said they couldn't believe he had done sucha thing.Terrorists are hard to recognize. They don't wear the mark of Cain on theirforeheads.Kruithof said he felt horrible about not seeing Al-Jarrah's evil. \"Germanintelligence had tracked him in Hamburg, meeting with Atta. He was inAfghanistan for a few weeks. He wasn't there on a charity mission.\"I suggested that there is also a Dostoyevskian phenomenon to consider, theoverintellectualization of political acts. In Crime and Punishment, theprotagonist Raskolnikov kills an aged woman to test his theory that someone whomakes others' lives miserable doesn't deserve to live.Kruithof considered the comparison between Raskolnikov and his fledgling pilot.\"When I looked into his eyes,\" he said finally, \"I saw someone intelligent,perhaps too intelligent for our society. Someone who is bitter and cold. Someonewho passes by an old man who can't walk anymore and decides the man should besubtracted from the equation for walking so slow. The cause was more importantthan the life.\"I asked Kruithof if there is some way to pick out a terrorist, someone whointends you great harm. He paused, considering my question. In America we seeterrorists everywhere we look, but he had known a real one.\"Al-Jarrah dressed well,\" he said. \"He looked European. Good social manners. Hewas hard to spot. He was slow at times, but he trained up to a commerciallevel.\"Kruithof sighed heavily. \"You think it's someone you like, who you used to hangout with. It's hard for the brain to accept what happened.\"FINDING THINGS TO WORRY ABOUTThe advisories are full of suggestions about how to protect oneself, how torecognize a likely suspect by the way he or she dresses or acts. But Kruithofwitnessed up close the danger that we just imagine. He, like the rest of us,lacked an accurate fear radar. Meanwhile the terrorists continue to generatefear with an impact that extends well beyond their actual numbers. It isterrorism that infects us, not the terrorists themselves. The shadows they caston us are longer than the shadows of real men.PROFITING FROM FEARTampering with prescription drugs could be a way for terrorists to launch anattack on Americans, according to acting Food and Drug AdministrationCommissioner Lester Crawford.—Associated Press report, August 11, 2004In the first years of the twenty-first century, we are filled with worry anddread in part because we have been taught to rely on false props to protect us.We tell one another that we have to look a certain way, eat certain foods, evenswallow certain pills, in order to remain healthy and safe. We rely on anelaborate system of danger signals that have inspired the creation of anelaborate system of safety signals. Since both sets of signals are ofteninaccurate, we are unnecessarily unsettled and then falsely reassured. Oursuperstitions fall apart as soon as we encounter the slightest contradiction toour controlled world.Aging and illness scare us because they are tied to the inevitability of deathand suffering, our ultimate fears. Advertisements in the media rely on thesefears to generate the need for products. These products feed billion-dollarindustries, which in turn foster dependencies to keep themselves in business. Weworship the illu-88PROFITING FROM FEARsions these products provide, and in so doing we think we can keep ourselvessafe.The Promise of PillsIn America, we pay outlandish prices for cosmetic surgeries and for ourmedications. In fact, we are willing to pay any price if it helps keep usinsulated from the inevitability of death. Manufacturers manipulate us byplaying to this notion of keeping us beyond harm. Medications that workperfectly well are stampeded into disuse by the magic-elixir claims of the newdrugs. These preparations are more expensive but often not worth the additionalcost.Europeans, in contrast, are not held hostage to the same extent. To cite oneimportant example, Europeans are often able to use their entire populations as acohort—a large group of patients with a common need—to compel drug manufacturersto charge far less than we pay here in the United States for the same drugs. Itis essentially a take-it-or-leave-it approach, fueled by the courage to say no.So while the drug companies are forced to sell close to the margin in Europe,they make up the difference in the cowardly American market, inflating ourdomestic drug prices by an additional 2 to 3 percent per year, according to IMSHealth, a market research firm in Fairfield, Connecticut.The governments of France, Italy, and Spain boldly use direct price controls,limiting prices at the launch of a product and later controlling the amount ofreimbursement once the drug is on the market. Spain and Britain also limitprofitability on a drug-by-drug basis. The U.S. House Committee on GovernmentReform, in a 2001 report on prescription drug prices, found that as a result ofcontrols, such drugs cost 31 percent to 48 percent less in Canada, France,Italy, Britain, Germany, and Japan than in the United States.In the contemporary American climate of \"me-too\" drugs, new drugs that lowerblood pressure or cholesterol or soothe the stomachFALSE ALARMcompete with older, satisfactory products in the same class. The advertisingploy is invariably a \"you can't do without this\" approach, with high pricessupposedly justified by the expense of research and development.What the drug companies don't say is that the availability of an excessivenumber of duplicate products, aggressively promoted, only increases theperception of need. And we hardly feel safer once we realize that sheer numbersdon't correspond to an increased ability to treat disease. The implicitrationale, if one product doesn't protect you from illness, why not try anotherone, is hardly comforting. With a new blockbuster drug, it isn't unusual for amanufacturer to budget $50 million to $100 million for advertising aimed atconsumers, according to Rx Insight, a consulting group that advises drugcompanies. In 2000, for example, Pfizer spent $89.5 million trying to convinceconsumers that Viagra was essential to their well-being.Meanwhile, tried and true antibiotics like penicillin and amoxicillin that costpennies are overlooked in favor of new brand-name drugs. Zithromax and Levaquin,to name two, are given out in doctors' offices to almost every nervous patientwith a cough. The ad-driven patients push for these expensive drugs, and doctorsreadily prescribe them.The United States and New Zealand are the only industrialized countries in theworld that haven't banned direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical advertising. WesternEurope has saved billions of dollars by not allowing this questionable form ofseduction.In America, extensive advertising has created a furor of religious zealsurrounding certain drugs. Every day I treat patients with ad-driven cravingsfor a drug.In the United States, Lipitor, which brought Pfizer revenues of $8.6 billionworldwide in 2001, cost $2.38 per 10-milligram tablet wholesale in 2003—that is,the cost to pharmacies. The same pill was sold to French pharmacists for 75cents. It cost 93 cents in Britain.PROFITING FROM FEARWhile the major drug companies are largely ineffective in dictating Europeanprices, from time to time they threaten to stop supplying the drugs, but theEuropean governments remain unafraid. In 2002, Germany's health ministry took a$200 million stipend from the world's largest drug companies so that it wouldn'tcut prescription drug prices 4 percent across the board. Germany took the moneyyet went ahead with the price cut anyway, and because 80 percent of prescriptiondrugs in that country are purchased by the national health insurance system, thedrug companies had no choice but to accept the ministry's terms.Europe accounts for just over 20 percent of the pharmaceutical industry's morethan $400 billion world market, according to IMS Health. The United Statesaccounts for 46 percent. But with our unregulated practices, driven by theAmerican consumer's fear of going without, we are the source of more than 60percent of the industry's profit. We are filling its coffers, rather than usingour collective influence to negotiate better prices. We could certainly buy alot more drugs at the prices Europeans pay for them.Beyond the astronomical prices for the latest drugs, there is the worry of doingwithout medicines altogether. Advertising creates a heightened need for thesedrugs, and then patients discover they can't afford them, and the fear grows.Many of my patients, living on a fixed income from Social Security and a smallpension, are perfect candidates for real prescription drug coverage. Manypatients would sleep better at night knowing they could afford at least the mostessential medicines.But the Medicare drug plan—approved at the end of 2003—is another example offalse reassurance causing yet more alarm once it is exposed as being inadequate.Under the new Medicare plan, patients are faced with high deductibles, $420 inyearly co-pays, and the prospect of $3,600 coming out of their pockets at topdollar prices just to receive $1,500 in coverage before more complete coveragekicks in. When I explained the details of the new plan, one patient simply shookhis head. \"Not for me, Doc,\" he said.FALSE ALARMThis poor paralyzed patient suffers from diabetes and hypertension, and herelies on the free samples in my closet to treat these conditions. When I runout of samples, his blood pressure shoots up. His blood sweetens and unsweetens,depending on whether I can offer him his diabetes pill or not.The new drug coverage merely serves to extract top-drawer prices from largergroups of clients who couldn't afford the medicines before. Since Medicare isn'tallowed to negotiate, the government will pay full price for the coverage theydo provide, and the patients will then have to pay cash prices for their drugswhen they reach the gap in coverage. Once patients realize this, they are boundto thrash around like fish out of water. In 2003 the New York Public InterestResearch Group (NYPIRG) published a survey of one hundred pharmacies, revealingthat cash consumers of prescription drugs paid 100 percent more on average fortheir medicines than the government paid for army or veteran supplies, and 130percent more than Canada paid. Joel Eichel, the chief pharmacist at BigelowPharmacy in New York City, validated NYPIRG's finding that cash customers paidthe highest prices for their drugs. Eichel cited as an example Lipitor, thecholesterol-lowering drug. In 2003, the government paid $41.12 for a month'ssupply of 10-milligram tablets. Eichel said that pharmacies paid just under $60for a month's supply, but the cash customer paid $85.30. Eichel admitted that\"cash customers are paying a price so that a retailer can make a profit.\"So here is a manufacturer's dream: a pocket-lining system that falselyreassures. A drug company's ability to charge an outrageous price is a testamentto the perceived indispensability of a drug. The more afraid we are to gowithout a drug, the more we are willing to pay for it.This ballooning process of fear-induced propaganda can be traced back to 1981.At that time, \"Ira Lassiter,\" a popular journalist who had been suffering fromarthritis of the hips for many years, saw the first television ad for apharmaceutical. This ad glamorized Motrin, one of the original arthritis drugs,and IraPROFITING FROM FEARbecame one of many who asked his physician at the time to prescribe it.\"The pill helped me,\" Ira said many years later. \"But I thought it was supposedto cure me. When it didn't cure me, I became even more worried about what myarthritis might do to me.\" This cycle of worry is at the heart of what is wrongwith the role of prescription drugs in modern medical practice.Once the process had started, it was difficult to stop. In February 2002 the NewEngland Journal of Medicine published a study showing that direct-to-consumeradvertising constituted 16 percent of drug promotion spending. At the same timethe National Institute for Health Care Management released a study showing that2001 drug costs were up 17.1 percent from the year before, with most of theincreases in four heavily advertised categories: arthritis, cholesterol,depression, and allergy. The Kaiser Family Foundation demonstrated anassociation between consumer advertising expenditures and drugs that weregrowing the fastest. The implication behind the advertising was that without acertain drug you couldn't be healthy, an essential fear tactic.In 1997 the FDA issued a series of feeble guidelines that allowed TV ads withonly a brief mention of side effects. According to Rx Insight, the drugcompanies refer to this as \"liberation day.\"After 1997 the drug companies struggled to create name recognition usingextensive television and magazine ads. Doctors found themselves compelled torespond to nervous ad-driven questions rather than those of fundamental medicalimportance. A report from UCLA in 2000 concluded that the effects of this wouldbe that \"we will have a world of aggressive, distrustful and only partiallyinformed patients and cowed physicians.\"Surveys by the FDA in 1999 and 2003, and by Kaiser in 2001, showed that between20 and 30 percent of consumers, or more than 50 million people, responded tothese drug ads by questioning their doctors. But the same studies revealed thatalmost 60 percent of consumers felt that the warnings of potential side effectscommunicated by these ads were inadequate. Here was theFALSE ALARMcycle of fear. When patients experienced the side effects of their \"nirvana\"pills, they became more frightened, as false reassurance over time ultimatelyled to more fear.Into the 1990s Ira Lassiter continued to suffer from arthritis of the hips, andhe first came to me for his medical care five years ago. Ira became caught inthe billion-dollar struggle between Merck and Pfizer over two drugs forarthritis, Vioxx and Celebrex. This minidrama played itself out in my office.Ira was a reasonable patient who readily followed a doctor's advice, yet theadvertising wars over prescription drugs confused and frightened him. He askedto switch from Motrin to Vioxx as the result of a TV ad, and I accommodated him.Then I reassured Ira when Vioxx's competitors first ran campaigns to discreditit, until it turned out that the association with heart disease was legitimate.Ira stopped the drug long before it was taken off the market in September 2004,and then he switched to Celebrex when Pfizer hyped it in the wake of Merck'sremoving Vioxx from the shelves. The Vioxx removal scared millions of arthritissufferers unnecessarily, as they careened back and forth from exaggeratedexpectations to worry that this pill might actually be harming them.This process continued in December, when studies showed an apparent increasedrisk of heart disease in patients with a prolonged use of Celebrex or naproxen(Aleve). Ira, like many of my patients, fled from one drug to the other and soonwas off both. The pendulum swung from panacea to panic, and drugs that weremisperceived as lifesavers instantly became villains.Of course the perception of risk was much greater than the real threat. Thedamning studies showed that a few people out of a thousand patients could be atrisk to suffer a heart attack while on one of these drugs. And the patients inthe studies had been taking high doses of the drug every day for several months,which was an extended use that didn't apply to most people who became afraid ofthe drug.The very day that Vioxx was removed from the market back inPROFITING FROM FEARSeptember 2004, a Pfizer representative was stationed in my office trying toconvert me to the Celebrex faith.\"Have you no shame?\" I asked her. \"Don't you realize that these drugs havesimilar effects?\"\"Celebrex doesn't have that problem,\" she retorted, without any scientificdocumentation to back up her assertion. When Celebrex advertising was pulled byPfizer in December, this drug rep never acknowledged her mistake, but simplymoved on to hyping the next product.Drug companies were trying to create a fear that the \"other guy\" would hurt youwhile only they could help you. Perhaps the most down and dirty advertising warwas occurring in the world of allergy. After years of sniffling miserably, manyof my patients had settled on Claritin (Schering-Plough) as the antihistaminethat provided the most relief while making them the least drowsy. But the patenton Claritin expired in 2002, and it went over the counter at one-third theprice, two major defeats for Schering after it had spent a fortune successfullymarketing this drug and turning it into a $3-billion-a-year product.Monopolizing the over-the-counter market for antihistamines might have been aconsolation, but Johnson & Johnson had already applied for approval of itsgeneric product and was beating Schering to the punch. So Schering developed amore potent drug, Clarinex, and began to knock its own product, Claritin, as notas effective. Schering also engaged in a multimedia billion-dollar advertisingface-off with other drug companies—in particular, Pfizer (Zyrtec) and Aventis(Allegra)—over their products. Each manufacturer was claiming that the otherguy's product wasn't as effective, made you sleepier, and had more side effects.The drug companies do their best to undermine their competitors and to instillfear in any patient who happens to be taking the other guy's product. In 2002the American Medical Association protested that the ads do nothing to educateeither patients or physicians. Consumer advocacy groups and even healthmaintenance organizationsFALSE ALARMlobbied Congress, but the drug company lobbyists outnumbered their oppositioneleven to one. The FDA turned a blind eye.\"I saw an ad for an antidepressant during half time of the Super Bowl,\" IraLassiter said. \"It showed a beautiful person smiling, saying how much themedicine helped. Soon you'll have people asking you for the drug who aren't evendepressed.\"\"Until they find out it ruins their sex lives, which they don't bother to say onTV,\" I replied.Ira thought this over. \"So then they'll ask you for another billion-dollar drug,Viagra, to compensate,\" he said, catching on to how the process works. \"You'llgrow dependent on the new pill too and be afraid to go without both.\"A victim of advertising, Ira tried one anti-inflammatory medicine after another.But his hips ached, no matter what drug I prescribed.\"The expensive new pills don't work any better than the cheap old pills, andthey may not be as safe,\" Ira concluded during one of his worst days, when hiships could interpret the humidity as well as any weather forecaster predictingrain. Ira was growing more and more cynical, and on the rare day when hissymptoms eased and he felt well, he would claim that medications had nothing todo with it.He would not consider hip surgery—probably because no hip prosthesis salesmancame to my office to soft-sell him through it.Despite his lack of success, Ira continued filling his gym bag with drug samplesfrom my supply closet. There were fewer arthritis drugs there now, but therewere still green boxes of Mobic, a newer nonsteroidal drug that had yet to beassociated with safety issues. The samples were free, and Ira was aself-proclaimed addict.On his most recent visit just before a trip out of town, Ira took samples of ared antibiotic to keep on hand for frequent sinus infections that I was alsohaving trouble treating. When he called me a few days later with what soundedlike another sinus infection, I told him to take the red antibiotic. When hecalled back to say he was feeling better, not only in terms of his sinuses, butalso his hips, I finally sensed a breakthrough.PROFITING FROM FEAR\"Which arthritis pill are you taking now?\" I asked eagerly.\"None of them.\"\"And your hips are better?\"I was ready to believe that his sinuses were better as a result of taking thered antibiotic. But I couldn't understand the sudden improvement in his hips.\"What are you taking besides the red pill?\"\"Nothing. Just an aspirin every four or five hours, for the cold.\"\"Aspirin? That must be what's helping your hips!\"It was Ira who had had a breakthrough; he had broken through his prescriptiondrug dependency.From that moment on, Ira would have nothing to do with any of the fancy pillsthat modern medicine or its sales representatives could offer him. Cured of hispenchant for the ads, he insisted on taking only aspirin for his hips. He wassurprised to find out how cheap aspirin was and how well it could work.In relying on his intuition, sometimes a patient is able to overcome anessential fear of illness that the glut of shiny pills continues to encourage. Irelearned an old lesson: often an old-fashioned remedy works better and is morecomforting to the patient than the latest hyped discovery.As for Ira's sinuses, I soon learned that the new chemical had not helped me tocure them either. It turned out his sinuses had cleared that night not from anystate-of-the-art, sports-car-red antibiotic but from the chicken soup and hottea the hotel bellhop had brought up to his room.The Antifear DrugFor a while after Ira's success I was smitten with aspirin, the old remedy, thesimple comfort. Occurring in nature, costing mere pennies, with no one to hypeit, aspirin is the antifear drug. It is useful without being misperceived as acure-all.The ancient Greeks used the bark of the willow tree to relieve pain and combatfever without knowing what it contained.FALSE ALARMMaimonides also wrote of these,effects in the twelfth century. But it wasn'tuntil the nineteenth century that Johann Buchner, a German chemist, isolated anactive glucoside from the bark, calling it salicin (after Salix, the Latin namefor the willow tree). Sodium salicylate then became a useful medication to treatpain, particularly joint aches.In 1897, Felix Hoffman, an employee at a German fabric-dyeing company known asBayer, sought a chemical to lessen the misery of his father's arthritis. He cameupon acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), produced by the company's chemists but thenignored. ASA proved to be quite effective for his father's pains, and it lackedthe bitter taste and some of the stomach upset of sodium salicylate.Bayer patented ASA and called it aspirin.The chemical compound in aspirin—acetylsalicylic acid—is closely related to thesalicylates found in fruit and vegetables. Berries are a good source. Herbs andspices and tea also contain high amounts.So it turns out the food we farmed and gathered back when we couldn't buyeverything in a store contained an essential chemical. Since the averageAmerican diet is now low in fruit and vegetables, aspirin takes its place.Aspirin's effectiveness at preventing heart attacks and strokes is tied to itsantiplatelet effects, the sticky blood components that initiate clots. Aspirinalso works as an anti-inflammatory agent, blocking enzymes cyclooxygenase 1 and2. These enzymes are necessary for the growth of intestinal cancer cells. Inseveral studies a 40 percent reduction in the incidence of colon cancer has beenshown in patients taking aspirin.Another landmark study in the May 2004 journal of the American MedicalAssociation found that women taking aspirin daily had a 26 percent lower risk ofdeveloping estrogen-stimulated tumors, the most common type of breast cancer.But aspirin is not a cure-all. It is poorly tolerated in patients with asthma orkidney disease. Stomach irritation and bleedingPROFITING FROM FEARare common side effects. Hemorrhagic stroke occurs in one in every thousandregular aspirin takers. The public can still too easily fall into that familiarcycle of hype and disappointment, followed by worry. No medical crutch can carrythe weight of all our illnesses, not even a basic remedy like aspirin.The renewed interest in aspirin comes at a time when medical props areoverglorified as tools to keep us from aging or getting sick. But even thisold-time remedy, which has turned out to have major uses never beforeconsidered, is not effective in calming our deepest fears.Vaccine FearsVaccine fears cut both ways. Sometimes we feel afraid of the disease, while atother times we feel afraid of the vaccine. The concept of disease protection canbe useful, if the protection offered is substantial. In fact, in the pastvaccines have helped public health scientists to eradicate or diminish thethreats of diseases such as smallpox and polio, thereby diminishing associatedfears.At other times, as with the flu vaccine shortage in the fall of 2004, we havecome to covet a vaccine as a health panacea even when it offers at best onlylimited protection against a disease.Sometimes, even while feeling protected, we have also been made to feel afraidof some of these same vaccines. Mercury-based vaccines like thimerosal, forexample, have been suspected of potential neurotoxicity for years without proof.Two large epidemiological studies in the United States and Denmark didn't find agreater risk of autism in children who received thimerosal-containing vaccines.Recently a study from Columbia University did find that a mercury preservativeused in vaccines may have caused some behavioral changes in a strain of mice.Still, showing that thimerosal or mercury-based vaccines can be associated withslight neurotoxicity in mice is not the same as proving an association withautism in humans.FALSE ALARMParents of autistic children naturally look for a cause-and-effect relationshipassociated with a potential threat. But what has been uncovered is not proof,especially at a time when the prevalence of autism appears to be increasing inpart due to improved diagnostic sensitivity.Vaccine manufacturers contribute to the hysteria by not screening their productscarefully enough. Even if thimerosal has not been shown to cause autism, itstill should have been removed as soon as some toxicity was shown. Instead,years of inaction contributed to a climate of fear. Despite the fact that avaccine should be pure, vaccine manufacturers have also stubbornly persisted inusing pooled bovine serum for their vaccines from regions of Europe where madcow disease has been endemic. The manufacturers' refusal to carefully vet theirproduct or to remove a questionable additive has fueled public distrust.Unfortunately, the sense that scientific rigor and caution are not alwaysapplied to vaccine manufacture translates too easily into a distrust of allvaccines. There is a tendency to generalize a fear of one vaccine to a fear ofevery vaccine. Fears of autism and mercury shouldn't automatically extend to adistrust of any product a drug company brings to market.Fear in Our FoodMany of us are obsessed with certain methods of dieting, adhering to elaborateregimes that will transform us into our ideal selves. The goal of eternal beautyand youth that drives us is connected to our fear of death, as if superstitiousritual could keep us beyond harm. A study in October 2003 revealed that simplydrinking eight glasses of water per day is just as good for losing weight as thecultlike ephedra, but of course water intake lacks the aura of self-sacrificethat is at the heart of modern dieting.All of our most popular religions include food fasts or restrictions as a methodof purging the soul. The Christians have Lent;PROFITING FROM FEARthe Jews, Yom Kippur; the Muslims, Ramadan. We punish ourselves for ourindiscretions. Our souls will rise, and later, if we are forgiven, we will befree from harm.Popular diets such as Atkins are diets of contrition—they play into a cycle ofpunishment and reward that centers on a phobia of carbohydrates.Carbohydrates are sinful foodstuffs under Atkins, and the mandate from thedietary gods is that carbs must be avoided at all costs. Atkins devotees fillplates with carcinogenic bacon, while sugar triggers their fear apparatus. It isas if verboten chocolate cake can somehow directly enter your coronary arteriesand stop your heart on the spot, whereas fried eggs cannot.Like fanatical religion, fanatical dieting means giving over control to thedirectives of a zealot. Dietary prophets twist the terminology of weight lossuntil theirs seems to be the only true road to salvation. Their books rise onthe best-seller lists as their followers become more and more fervent, feelingsafe and comfortable only when following the \"good word,\" and deeply afraid ofchoosing any other dietary path.Yet many, as they obsess over the numbers, lose sight of the good health that issupposed to accompany a slimmer body. And others even lose sight of the weight,getting lost in the compulsive ritual of the process, as though, like religion,the details of dieting can somehow protect you. For those unfortunate souls whofail, they can still seek protection from a more powerful prophet—the plasticsurgeon. The perils of obesity can be instantly circumvented. Liposuction orgastric stapling or even a simple tummy tuck represents a miracle cure for thosenewly converted to the cosmetic faith.From Antibiotic Safety to Pill DependencyJust a generation ago, when my parents were children, a single scratch on thearm could evolve into a life-threatening septic wound infection without theantibiotics available to stop it. ThisFALSE ALARMwas a true danger. Yet people.learned to live with this perilous risk, whichstatistically speaking, was still not an imminent threat to most people. A senseof relative safety kept people from panicking.The discovery of antibiotics went a long way toward making people feellegitimately safer when it came to infections. Unfortunately, it wasn't longbefore antibiotics became part of the inflated danger/protector cascade. A needis created by drug company ads for each new medication as if it is just aslifesaving as penicillin. We develop pill dependencies, because we are told howcrucial these pills are to our well-being—hormone replacement therapy is a primeexample of a supposed panacea that left a trail of fear when its true effectswere unmasked.Medications such as aspirin or Lipitor prevent countless premature deaths, butmost medications hyped as crucial really aren't. The overall result is apanicked, pill-popping public.We are afraid to grow old, afraid to get sick. Today's pills put only a thincoating over our ultimate fear of death. Pills and plastic surgery are used tokeep us looking and feeling like we imagine \"the beautiful people\" feel, for aslong as possible.The Real Danger of CigarettesOver the past half century, cancer has taken the place of infection in terms ofits reputation for striking people down in the midst of good health. Cancerpetrifies us. An earlier generation's worry about common infections has becomethis generation's fear of cancer.Even though we can control some of the risks for cancer, such as cigarettesmoke, diet, and environmental toxins, the way our ancestors might have avoidedcontaminated food and water, powerful industry and tobacco lobbies downplay thereal risks of toxins and cigarettes. Instead, the media play up pseudodangers,while the real toxins that threaten us are obscured. We becomePROFITING FROM FEARmore and more disoriented, afraid of going without pills that really don'tprotect us, not afraid enough of the poisons that put us at genuine risk.Lobbyists have tried to convince legislators that tobacco smoke in the airdoesn't threaten us, when in fact it contains thousands of different toxicchemicals including nicotine, carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, and sulfurdioxide. Secondhand smoke is the third leading preventable cause of death in theUnited States, killing at least fifty thousand nonsmokers every year. In reportsfrom the surgeon general, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the NationalResearch Council, environmental tobacco smoke is identified as a causativefactor in all respiratory illnesses including asthma, heart disease, pneumonia,and lung cancer.Though many of the toxic particles of cigarette smoke are simply the by-productsof a fire, they are found in much higher amounts in cigarette smoke than inemissions from fireplaces or gas stoves. Nevertheless, more public healthwarnings and restrictions are attached to heaters and grills than to cigarettes,another prime example of the public's attention being focused on the wrongdangers.There is a deep-rooted public resistance to thinking that familiar objects areperilous. We tend to believe that an invisible remote pathogen like SARS orsarin gas can infiltrate our air more easily than a common cigarette.Cigarettes are familiar props in our society. We saw them romanticized inmovies, television ads, and glossy magazines, before promoting cigarettes wasrestricted. We are still slow to accept the danger of casual exposure. Even ifmost people have now accepted that smoking itself is dangerous, secondhand smokeis still tied to the dreamy images of our youth, wafts of it tickling our faceson a moonlit night.People who are lulled into such a false sense of security are not brought fullyawake until they experience a sudden chest pain or the frightening feeling ofnot being able to catch their breath.FALSE ALARMWho to Turn To?When a person becomes seriously ill, a trusted doctor can be very helpful. He orshe can provide perspective on the illness, offering reassurance as well asproper context.Unfortunately, doctors aren't always trustworthy, and patients don't alwaystrust us. Without this kind of guidance, sudden illness is particularlyfrightening. It is a doctor's job to explain, yet many patients feel uninformedby their doctors. A study reported in the April 2004 Archives of InternalMedicine revealed that the majority of patients are interested in reviewingtheir medical chart because they are afraid that something is being kept fromthem. I rarely write notes in a patient's chart that I don't want them to beaware of, but my patients don't always believe this.Patients have a right to know, and the information physicians provide needs tobe understandable. Many of my patients worry about any lab or test result thatis red-marked as abnormal no matter how inconsequential I say that result is.Often, patients worry the most who don't feel well informed to begin with.We doctors do our patients a disservice when we aren't careful about the contextof the information we provide. We may exaggerate the level of danger to protectourselves from lawsuits in the event of an unlikely outcome.Many of the secrets of illness and health are being communicated to a patientdirectly by his own body. Doctors are most effective as guides when we listencarefully to patients' symptoms and help them put these symptoms in the contextof their illness in as straightforward a manner as possible. The more oblique weare, the more we hide behind a sanctimonious self-image, the less patients gaintrue perspective, and the more worried they become. We doctors can be fearedalong with the illness we are trying to treat.Part IIBUGS DU JOUR8ANTHRAXIf and when another attack on American soil occurs, however, everything we knowabout the psychology of fear suggests that it will lead to extreme public panicthat may be disproportionate to the actual casualties. The public respondsemotionally to remote but terrifying threats, and this leads us to make choicesabout security that are not always rational. . . . The vicious cycle at thispoint should be clear. The public fixates on low-probability but vivid risksbecause of images we absorb from television and from politicians.—Jeffrey Rosen, The Naked CrowdExactly a month after September 11, 2001, at a time when many of us feltvulnerable, a mysterious white powder began appearing in the mail rooms of majormedia outlets, from the National Enquirer in Boca Raton, Florida, to NBC News inNew York. Attacking media centers, the national nervous system, is an instantway to broadcast a message of panic.At first this message seemed to come right from the international terroristgroup that had just destroyed the World TradeFALSE ALARMCenter. And by the time this no longer seemed to be the case, we were alreadyafraid to open our mail. The anthrax scare—the disproportionate public reactionto a few letters—was a direct manifestation of our growing fear of terrorism.The anthrax scare established a precedent, a pattern by which we would convertour unease into a specific threat. Each new public health risk from this pointforward would reach the news media and initiate an overreaction on a nationwidebasis. The government provides the information, and the media announce it. If wegive our fear a name, we can feel that we are engaged in a plan to protectourselves from it. The first name we gave our fear after 9/11 was anthrax.Some of us understood that our perception had been warped by the built-inpublicity of the moment when the media centers were hit. But then there wasKathy Nguyen, a Vietnamese woman from the Bronx who wasn't in the media and whowasn't a national figure or a senator, but who was just opening her mail.Nguyen's untimely death from an anthrax letter was seen as a warning that itcould happen to any of us. This everyman scene affected only one person, but itwas enough to petrify the public. The media broadcast Nguyen's fate until peopleeverywhere were afraid.It would have been far better if the information had been contained. This wouldhave allowed our federal agencies to quietly prepare an integrated response toanthrax without alarming the public and inflating the risk before the facts wereknown.Ever since then, we have been sent reeling from one bug du jour to another. Themedia megaphone alerts each time, and we wait expectantly for the latest hypedvirus or bacteria to overtake us individually and collectively. When it doesn't,we forget and move on to the next bug. The media have no memory, nor do we, as aresult. We do not gain perspective from the news, and we build on eachoverreaction until we have created a universal fear epidemic. Our collectivesense of immunity is fragile, and we feel as threatened by the hyping of atropical storm as by the latest virus.ANTHRAXA Simple Nasal SwabOn a cold morning early in November 2001, a black Lincoln limousine awaited mein the first light. It would take me to CNBC studios in Fort Lee, New Jersey,just over the George Washington Bridge.Three weeks after the first anthrax letter appeared, I was going to CNBC to giveBob Sellers, then their morning anchor, an anthrax test on the air.\"If you have flu symptoms, and you think it could be anthrax, then it's almostcertainly the flu and not anthrax,\" I said to the camera. \"Anthrax is notcontagious. But the fear of anthrax is.\"I worried that by demonstrating the nasal swab test on the air, by swabbingSellers's nostril with this ridiculously long Q-tip swab, I was sending thewrong public message. Teaching people the right way to get tested for anthraxwas absurd, since the public risk of getting anthrax was infinitesimally low.To my surprise, when we were finished, Bob Sellers asked me if be had anythingto worry about. He explained that since NBC had been hit with the letter to TomBrokaw, the mail rooms at CNBC had been sealed, and everyone worried thatanthrax might be in their midst.Sellers's producers as well as his coanchor listened carefully as I told themthere was no evidence that they had any exposure to anthrax. They breathedeasier.I called Sellers two days later to tell him that his anthrax culture wasnegative. This CNBC visit was the first time I saw up close that some newspeopleactually believe what they are reporting. True, in this case Sellers had apersonal reason to be cautious, but I was also able to see that he lived withthe same hype and worry that he was pushing onto us.Even in the Internet age, the postal service serves as an important avenue ofcommunication. The anthrax letters undermined our sense of well-being byattacking this basic need to be connectedFALSE ALARMwith the world around us. A positive feature of our lives turned into a randomavenue of death. On top of this problem, the FBI and the CDC fumbled the anthraxinvestigation, contributing further to an erosion of our sense of safety. Inretrospect, anthrax turned out to be a minor eruption, with only twenty-twocases and five deaths. But the handling of the crisis, with its misinformationand distortion, contributed to a widespread panic out of proportion to the riskat the time.First we were told by the news media to be afraid of something that didn't trulythreaten us. Then, once we were worried, we saw that our federal agenciesweren't functioning effectively, which worried us further.What Is Anthrax?Anthrax is a type of bacteria that doesn't move and lives in a capsule. It usesoxygen for energy and produces dormant spores that are hard to kill and canremain in the environment for years. Anthrax affects mostly animals, and humanscan catch it mainly by contact with infected animals. In most humans, anthrax isa curable skin infection. There are hundreds of cases yearly in the Middle East.In the United States, there have been only three cases of naturally occurringanthrax reported between 1984 and 1993.In the 1970s, epidemics of anthrax occurred in the former Soviet Union atSverdlovsk due to a military accident, and on the farms of Zimbabwe due toanimal contagion when the vaccination program was stopped there because of war.Anthrax is not contagious but may be introduced into the skin of a victim viacuts or by biting flies. A red sore develops, which forms a black ulcer. Ininhalation anthrax, the spores are breathed directly into the lungs and carriedto the lymph nodes. A powerful toxin develops. Once in the bloodstream of aninhalation anthrax victim, the anthrax bacteria evade capture by white bloodcells, and they multiply. But anthrax may be cured with an early and aggressivecourse of antibiotics.ANTHRAXIn terms of bioterror, it is difficult to deploy anthrax on a large scalebecause of wind, and most of the anthrax in a bomb would be destroyed ondetonation. Anthrax spores can persist in the environment but can also beremoved by careful decontamination.The Anthrax FumbleWhen the first anthrax-laden envelopes were received in October 2001, the FBIfroze the Centers for Disease Control out of the high-profile investigation,according to CDC officials. That meant half the country's experts on bioattacks(the army employs the other half), and the only scientists with a specialinterest in public health were kept out of the loop. Then, to make mattersworse, the CDC spread information it had received secondhand. All this resultedin a fumbled response that put some postal and media workers at serious risk andscared the public. The sense of inadequate protection against an overhypedthreat contributed to the spread of panic.The main problem was that the Centers for Disease Control, the government agencycharged with protecting the public from disease, was never permitted to see orexamine the anthrax letters. Without access, the CDC experts could notaccurately assess the danger the letters posed.Consequently, the public could not be properly informed. This mismanagementultimately contributed to the growing fear when more people unexpectedlydeveloped anthrax. The CDC flip-flopped from downplaying the risk to wallowingin worst-case scenarios in part because it didn't have solid information. Thisuncertainty spread fear.The scare began on October 12, 2001, when NBC news anchor Tom Brokaw received ananthrax letter postmarked in Trenton, New Jersey. It was immediately turned overto the FBI. The CDC never examined it. Dr. Mitchell Cohen, the CDC's director ofbacterial diseases and liaison to the FBI, said he saw only photographs of it.On the basis of media accounts and conference callsFALSE ALARMwith the FBI, the CDC determined that the Brokaw letter was \"only risky to thosewho opened it.\" By October 18, 2001, though, several New Jersey postal workershad suspicious skin sores, and Teresa Heller, a West Trenton letter carrier, andRichard Morgano, a Hamilton postal worker, had confirmed cases of skin anthrax.New Jersey's Hamilton postal distribution center, which had processed the Brokawletter, was closed as a result of these cases, and hundreds of workers therewere given precautionary antibiotics. Had the FBI allowed the CDC to examine theBrokaw letter on October 12, the CDC would have been in a better position tomake assessments that might have led to an earlier closing of the Hamiltonfacility. The CDC might well have learned that this anthrax could spread beyondits envelope. Unfortunately, the FBI did not perform tests for leakage on theBrokaw letter. The CDC looked inept—watching TV for information like the rest ofus. The public's lack of confidence in our health officials is part of thereason we panicked. Once we realized that the CDC had underestimated the risk,many of us no longer trusted their statements, and we quickly overestimated therisk.A similar series of events occurred after Senator Tom Daschle's office receivedan anthrax letter on October 15, 2001. It had been handled by the Brentwoodpostal facility in Washington. Again, the CDC was not invited to examine theletter, and its doctors were unable to observe just how easily the anthrax itcontained could become airborne and spread. Nor could they run a test checkingfor cross-contamination by putting this envelope with other uncontaminatedenvelopes in a mail sorter.How was the CDC supposed to issue accurate directives if its doctors and labspecialists were kept away from the evidence? And when the authorities were onceagain found to be underestimating the danger, this again contributed to thepanic.All the anthrax letters were tested by the Bethesda-based U.S. Army MedicalResearch Institute on Infectious Disease. On October 16, 2001, microbiologistsat the army lab counted more than a billion spores in the Daschle envelope anddiscovered the fine militaryANTHRAXgrade of the powder, which should have alerted them right away to its potency.In a conference call that day with the FBI and the CDC, the army scientistsdescribed the powder as \"going poof,\" an indication it could become airborne.Yet, according to the CDC's Cohen, the army and FBI officials didn't expressconcern that this could lead to the spread of the more deadly inhaled form ofanthrax. In fact, Cohen said that the army scientists, having heard from FBIofficials that the Daschle letter was supposedly well sealed, predicted limitedspread—as they had with the Brokaw letter. Army scientists, who were notaccustomed to making public health proclamations, wrongly reassured the CDCwithout sufficiently testing the spread potential of this potent anthrax. TheCDC, in turn, blindly passed the information to the post office, claiming thatthere was no risk to postal employees and that mail-sorting equipment could bepresumed safe. The CDC based much of its information on the few previous casesof anthrax caught from animals.As with the Brokaw letter, the CDC wasn't given the opportunity to see firsthandthe powerful powder of the Daschle letter, which was already working its waythrough Brentwood by the time the actual letter hit Daschle's office. Armed withsuch knowledge, the CDC could have acted more quickly in examining postalworkers and providing antibiotics there. It might have even closed Brentwooddays earlier. But Brentwood continued to operate until October 21, 2001, and twoU.S. Postal Service workers there— Thomas Morris Jr. and Joseph Curseen Jr.—diedfrom inhaled exposure due to contaminated equipment. Their deaths helped provokethe widespread panic that ensued, in part because it again appeared that theCDC—our disease protector—had fumbled. But according to Cohen, the CDC \"basedour assumptions [concerning the Daschle letter] on limited epidemiologicalinformation from the letter to Tom Brokaw that the greatest risk was to thosewho opened the letters.\" This misinformation, based on speculation, wasn'tcorrected in time.The FBI also kept another piece of crucial evidence from the CDC. On October 19,2001, the New York Post turned over toFALSE ALARMthe bureau an anthrax letter it had received a week earlier. The letter had beenstored unopened by a mail room worker. Though this envelope was not unsealed,three Post employees—including the opinion editor—acquired skin anthrax fromhandling the letter, which seemed to spread skin anthrax to anyone who touchedit. Had the letter been shared with the CDC, its scientists could have testedseepage from the envelope and assessed the level of danger. If these cases hadbeen prevented, the hysteria might well have died out sooner.It wasn't until the last week in October 2001 that the FBI used DNA tracers andan electron microscope to discover that the anthrax could escape through tiny,50-micron holes in the envelope, and that it became airborne if the envelope wascompressed, shaken, or passed through a sorter. This knowledge, if availableearlier, could have informed the CDC's evaluation of the situation andreinforced its image as a reliable source of information. Instead, by the end ofOctober the public's imagination had been inflamed by the constant speculationthat this anthrax could turn up anywhere.In mid-November 2001, an envelope addressed to Senator Patrick Leahy andcontaining anthrax was discovered. Again the CDC wasn't included in the FBI-armyexamination, which once more showed an aggressive type of bacteria. The Leahyletter demonstrated leakage without a single lab test. As the letter was beingcarried from the FBI to the army lab, an embarrassingly large puddle of powderleaked from a hole in the envelope into the plastic bag containing it.By this time four possibly preventable anthrax deaths—including Kathy Nguyen onOctober 29 and Ottilie Lundgren on November 11—had already occurred as a resultof the mailings. Earlier precautions at the post office could have kept thedeadly cross-contaminated mailings from ever reaching the last two women whodied. Preventing these deaths could have significantly slowed the growinghysteria.Clearly, there were holes in the safety net. Here's how biode-fense was supposedto work: The army and the CDC had the onlyANTHRAXtwo top-response (Level D) microbiology laboratories in the country with theequipment and security clearance needed to study anthrax. When a federal crimeinvolving contagion occurred, as with the anthrax mailings, the FBIautomatically alerted the army lab. But the FBI had the power to expand thescope of the inquiry to include CDC experts. What was missed by one scientistmight be discovered by another. And while the army's primary concern wasbiowarfare, the CDC was concerned with public health issues. In fact, Dr. JulieGerberding, the CDC's then deputy director for infectious diseases (promotedafter the anthrax fumble in part because of her boss's poor handling of it),admitted to Senator Chuck Grassley's staff during their investigation that theanthrax should have been seen before the CDC offered public healthannouncements.While consulting for Grassley I determined that if the CDC was being left out,the postal service was being ignored. According to Deborah Wilhite, senior vicepresident for government relations at the postal service, \"The different focusesof law enforcement and health organizations resulted in parties speakingdifferent 'languages.'\"The FBI was in charge of this \"tower of babel\" team, and the army did thetesting, while the CDC, known around Capitol Hill as the Rodney Dangerfield offederal agencies, was on the wrong end of conference calls. In contrast to thereal Rodney Danger-field, who famously got no respect, the CDC did not complain.In the wake of the anthrax mailings, the CDC was to be more directly involved inbioterror defense planning. The new Department of Homeland Security intended toact as a liaison between the agencies. One could only hope that the FBI wouldbecome willing to cooperate, wouldn't automatically declare everything a crimescene, and wouldn't pirate away the evidence from other discerning scientificeyes.Anthrax was the prototype for overreaction based on inadequate information. Itset in motion a mode of public response that was always out of proportion to thepublic risk. After underestimatingFALSE ALARMthe anthrax risk to mail carriers and a few members of the media and public, theCDC never again wanted to be seen as underreact-ing. Instead, the CDCconsistently overreacted and scared us unnecessarily. Every potential infectionbecame an opportunity for a hyperbolic public health/media response. From theanthrax crisis onward, the CDC began to dramatize concerns at the earliest stageof a potential health crisis.The anthrax letters cost five lives (including tabloid photo editor RobertStevens of Boca Raton—the first death), with eighteen others sick andrecovering, while at the same time scaring millions of people who were at zerorisk.Fear for SaleThe CDC had helped administer antibiotics to thirty thousand postal, media, andgovernment workers who weren't anywhere near where the anthrax had been found.The antibiotic authorized for use, Cipro (three hundred dollars for a month'ssupply), was ten times more expensive than generic equivalents like doxycy-cline(thirty dollars for a month's supply), which had been tested and found to beequally effective against the anthrax bacteria. Examination of this particularanthrax strain revealed no drug resistance to any of these antibiotics, but theCDC wasn't told this by the army lab, and the more expensive Cipro continued tobe used.In the end, many more people got sick from the side effects of Cipro than fromthe noncontagious anthrax.In New York, state and city health departments relied blindly on the guidanceand the presence of the CDC. Expensive resources were marshaled to test largenumbers of the population, with no real reason to believe that this wasnecessary. Labs were readied to perform nasal swab testing of all who might havebeen exposed to anthrax and blood cultures on those who might already be sick.(The blood cultures could supposedly help distinguish anthrax from flu.) Theconfusion about testing—who to test, how to test,ANTHRAXhow many to test—typified the lack of knowledge and the lack of communicationbetween the CDC and the local agencies it was asked to inform.With the anthrax scare, the public perception of a potential catastrophe wasexacerbated by a growing awareness of governmental confusion, necessitating anadditional expenditure just to combat hysteria.Cipro ProfitsIn October 2001 every closet in my medical office was suddenly filled withsamples of ciprofloxacin. For over a week, every patient phone call I receivedand almost every patient visit to my office included a frantic request for thisordinary antibiotic, which was intended primarily for use with bladderinfections.Physicians as well as patients were stockpiling the drug. One of my patientsreturned home to his wife, and instead of reassuring her with news of his normaltest results, he bragged, \"I've got it, I've got it,\" brandishing his hoard ofCipro samples. Another patient called me from Philadelphia to ask whether sheshould take Cipro to prevent anthrax. \"No. Not unless you live inside theNational Enquirer building in Boca Raton,\" I replied. Five minutes later shecalled me back frantically—her neighbor was returning from Boca, wheeling herpossibly contaminated luggage down the hall—\"No,\" I groaned. \"No Cipro.\"The Cipro manufacturer was stoking this frenzy and playing into public hysteriaby promoting the drug. The drug reps dropped off hundreds of sample cartons atmy office without saying why, though I could see them frowning whenever theyheard me say, \"I am not prescribing Cipro to prevent anthrax.\"Why Cipro? What the drug company Bayer was not telling either patient or doctorwas that Cipro's usefulness for prevention was speculative. It had not beenshown to work better than other cheaper antibiotics like doxycycline or evengood old penicillin.FALSE ALARMWhich was not to say that any of these antibiotics should have been prescribed.If too many people took it, resistance would develop, rendering the antibioticless useful for common infections. Prolonged use of Cipro without a realtreatment target or reasonable endpoint would cause significant side effects ina large population. Insomnia affected 5 percent of Cipro users, a fact that wasof interest to the drug rep for Ambien who followed the Cipro rep into my officeduring the anthrax scare to encourage me to prescribe more sleeping pills.A drug company was making a public display, attaching itself to the exact fearthat was crippling us at the time. The well-dressed Cipro rep who visited myoffice, plying me with free lunches, was justifying the fear by acting as if hehad the only treatment for it. This was what the drug company knew best,parasitism. Just one month post-9/11, we found our dread exploited by a monoliththat couldn't resist an opportunity to make more money.Doctoring Anthrax FearAnthrax was scary because it could kill. Thinking about it was connected to afear of death.The urge to stockpile an antibiotic was a prophylaxis against the fear. But if Iallowed patients to have it, they would be more likely to take it unnecessarily,putting themselves at risk of side effects. If I prescribed it, I was condoningits use.The antidote for anthrax fear was knowledge, corrective information, but thistook time to work. In the meantime, back in the fall of 2001, people manifestedtheir fears by checking their mail carefully, washing frequently, and callingtheir doctors with their concerns.To calm short-term panic, sometimes it was necessary to administer tests toprove to a patient that she didn't have the disease. If this practice became toocommon, it would send the false message that more anthrax might be in theoffing.For those I couldn't reassure, for those who continued to believe they hadanthrax or insisted on medication for anthraxANTHRAXdespite all evidence to the contrary, I was compelled to admit defeat to the onecondition that could take hold in spite of any medical intervention. Fueledincessantly by speculation, this condition, the tool of terrorists, was the fearitself.By November 2001, twenty-two cases of anthrax seemed like twenty-two thousand tothe public. Hysteria, the true contagion, was sweeping the country like cropdusting. I was discussing this with an opinion editor at the New York Post whenI received a sudden e-mail back from him. \"Forget all the people overreacting,\"he wrote. \"Anthrax has hit my building and I have to get out.\"Finally, someone in real danger. I offered him antibiotics. He stubbornlydeclined, returning to work at the newspaper. Meanwhile, multitudes of otherswho had come nowhere near anthrax were stockpiling Cipro.Panic too easily blurred the distinction between the few at real risk and thevast majority who were at no risk. For a physician it was crucial to have arealistic concept of the likelihood of a disease's occurrence—I downplayedanthrax in 2001 precisely because I knew that the risk to my patients was solow.I e-mailed the Post editor again, stating my theory that physicians had todevelop reflexes to downplay worry in their patients.\"True. But I have a real reason to worry,\" he shot back.He was right. I again offered him prophylactic antibiotics.\"I'm not taking antibiotics when I'm not sick,\" was his reply. He reminded methat I was the one saying that people shouldn't be taking antibioticsneedlessly.\"But you're one of the few who need them,\" I wrote.Those who followed the news closely in late 2001 know the rest. He noticed a redmark on his forehead, a sore that soon turned the color of cigarette ash. He sawhis own doctor, and the biopsy came back positive for anthrax.He started on Cipro, but then he didn't want to take the whole sixty-day course.\"You must,\" I wrote in an e-mail. \"You're one of the few who really needsantibiotics.\"FALSE ALARM\"Okay,\" he replied. I'm not sure whether he completed the full sixty days, buthe did get better.The traditional reflexes of aggressive treatment when appropriate were just asimportant as the reflexes to counter undue fear.The anthrax panic in the United States continued for weeks. A patient who was aHolocaust survivor said the anthrax worries caused him to remember his feelingsof helplessness of long ago. Another patient complained that I was so busyasking about anthrax phobia that I almost forgot to treat her bronchitis.Several patients demanded flu shots—not because they needed them, which theydid, but because they were afraid to confuse the flu with the symptoms ofanthrax. I remember 2001 as the year when I first began to use flu shots tovaccinate against hysteria.He Sleeps with His Boots OnI barely recognized the patient, though he had been coming to see me for almostten years and I knew him well. It wasn't just that his appearance had changed,though the baseball cap pulled low over his eyes and the workman's shoes werenot his usual attire.Under the lights of my examination room, I realized that it was his manner thathad altered the most: formerly confident, even strident, now he leaned againstthe counter, not wanting to sit. He hunched over, wringing his hands, lookingtoward the window every few seconds.Seeing me, he seemed to calm, and I reminded him that the visit was a simplefollow-up for a prostate infection. He needed to leave a urine sample and hecould go, and I would call him in a few days with the results. He could stoptaking his Cipro.\"I've renewed it,\" he whispered, though his voice usually boomed.\"Why renew it? I gave you the refill in case the infection flared up again andyou couldn't reach me right away.\"\"Why should I stop now?\" And then came the words that were supposed to explaineverything: \"There's a war on.\"I could see him eyeing the closets in the examination room. WasANTHRAXhe wondering what medicines were there? I put my hand on his shoulder and welooked at each other. I realized that I had always treated this patient morelike a friend. He knew my home phone number; he was free to page me when Iwasn't on call. We liked to talk about sports. It was painful to consider thisnew source of tension that had come between us.In my consultation room I explained to the patient that the risks of taking thisexpensive antibiotic for an extended period far outweighed any benefit againstan unlikely microbe (the New York Post editor being by far the exception). Withprolonged use of the medicine this patient might develop diarrhea, rash, orinsomnia.\"Insomnia,\" he said. \"So what? I already can't sleep.\"I reviewed my office notes and saw that a few years before he'd had a briefspell of anxiety related to a problem at work. He had declined medication, andthe problem had resolved on its own.\"How about something to calm your nerves and help you sleep?\"The patient readily agreed this time. He was thirty-five and lived alone in awalk-up apartment six blocks from the World Trade Center site. He worked uptownat a communications firm and had been at work when the planes hit, but he hadsince returned to a smoky, soot-covered existence downtown, where he had to keepthe windows closed and his telephone hadn't worked for weeks. He told me hespent the night sitting in a chair, fully clothed, in case he had to leave at amoment's notice.I tried my best to reassure him. \"Nothing else is likely to happen right now.The risk of anthrax is extraordinarily low. Don't you believe me?\"\"Sure I believe you, Doc. But I just can't stop thinking about it.\"Across my desk I could see his bulky bag, bulging open with a gas mask. He saidhe carried it wherever he went. I tried not to look at it. \"Would you agree tosee a therapist?\"\"Are you saying I'm crazy?\"\"Of course not. I'm worried that your reaction is causing you pain.\"FALSE ALARM\"I can handle it. Let's talk about something more important. The vaccine foranthrax. Can you get it?\"\"It's not a very strong vaccine, and you can't get it here in America right now.If you insist on it, you can fly to England to get it.\"\"Are you crazy, Doc? Me get on a plane right now?\"The patient rose and headed to the front of the office. I felt that my \"plane\"suggestion, one month after September 11, had caused him to lose respect for me.\"Wait,\" I said. But he ignored me. He was heading for my supply closet at thefront of the office. Without hesitation, he began rummaging through it. Mynurse, who had never before seen a patient so boldly enter a private area of theoffice, seemed afraid to intervene. The patient knocked over pillboxes until hefound the antibiotic he was looking for, and then he stuffed it into his pocketsuntil my supply was exhausted. He left the office then, without saying goodbyeto anyone.I found myself ready to enter the hall after him, but my nurse wisely stoppedme. \"Let him go,\" she said.The New Safety NetJust assigning billions of dollars to the terrorism problem and spreading themoney around the country as was initiated by the federal government in thespring of 2002 did little more than spread the message that something might bein the offing.Provisions for a national stockpile of antibiotics and vaccines were wasteful.These items were perishable, and no biological agent was capable of spreadingthrough our populace overnight. Stockpiling was not a panacea; the country mighttemporarily feel more prepared psychologically, but to the tune of billions ofwasted dollars.In an op-ed in the Chicago Tribune in June 2002,1 wrote, \"But simply allottingmassive monies and card-shuffling various agencies does not ensure animpenetrable safety net.\"On June 29, 2002, the New York Times suddenly reported thatANTHRAXthe anthrax vaccine was being shifted to civilian uses amidst a sudden panic,with July 4 approaching, that a terrorist attack might be unleashed from Iraq,where \"well over 2,650 gallons of liquid anthrax\" were supposedly stored. Herein the United States, plans were hurriedly being made to stockpile the vaccinefor civilian use.But the vaccine was antiquated, cumbersome (requiring six doses), and not 100percent effective. It was also known for its flulike side effects. Other, moreeffective, better-tolerated vaccines were under investigation in Europe. Andthere was simply no evidence that anthrax was about to appear here.\"Yes, but should this vaccine be given to all Americans?\" Connie Chung asked meon CNN.\"I don't think that's necessary,\" I replied.The next day I received a scathing correspondence from the medical director ofthe vaccine manufacturer, Bioport, who stood to make great financial gains fromthe stockpiling of this vaccine. He protested that the vaccine was effective,not antiquated, and that its side effects were no different from those of anyother vaccine.He was wrong. The vaccine had been tested for effectiveness in a small group ofwool-gathering shepherds, not the general population. The data on side effectsclearly showed that at least 10 percent have muscle aches or flu symptoms—asignificant number when there is no anthrax in sight. Plus, the Bioport vaccinewas expensive, the federal supply price ($10.64) was expected to double, andcivilians would be paying a lot more.To Vaccinate or Not to Vaccinate?As a bug du jour, anthrax fell out of the spotlight after that July 4 scare,except for a brief mention as part of a lineup of possibilities with the firsttrumped-up terror alerts in late 2002 and early 2003. Then there was an anthraxgap until the last day of 2003, when the New York Times reported on page 1 theFDA announcement that the anthrax vaccine protected against the inhaled form ofthe bacteria. This FDA declaration aided government efforts to restartFALSE ALARMthe Pentagon's mandatory inoculation program for soldiers, which had beenstalled by a federal injunction. What was the truth here—was there newscientific evidence on the effectiveness of the old vaccine? Should soldiersgoing into battle take it?Mark S. Zaid, a lawyer who challenged the Pentagon's mandatory anthrax vaccineprogram, told the Times that the timing of the FDA announcement was driven bypolitics, not science. The FDA disagreed, claiming that numerous studies hadshown the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine against inhaled anthrax.The Wall Street Journal editorialized on January 2, 2004, that mandatoryvaccination for the military was the right thing to do. But the editorial alsorevealed that the FDA had admitted that there were \"too few inhalation anthraxcases to support an independent statistical analysis.\" The Journal arguedillogically that soldiers refusing the anthrax vaccine would weaken and endangertheir unit should the bacterium be used against them in battle, even thoughanthrax isn't contagious and none of it had been found in Iraq.The Journal called the FDA declaration \"a welcome blow to pseudoscientifichysteria.\" The editorial blamed the conspiracy mongers who had found a willingaudience in the media, stoking an increasingly scared society. \"A healthyapproach to science and risk is critical if we're going to protect ourselvesagainst threats going forward, especially those associated with bioterror.\"The Journal was right to caution against vaccine hysteria, but the editorial wasflawed. It was wrong to conflate a combat situation with the possibility ofcivilian bioterror. It was not clear, as the Journal suggested, that this wasone of our safest vaccines or that its use, even in the military, was crucial.In fact, this vaccine was still in the process of being tested by the CDC. Andbetter vaccines were under investigation, which the Journal failed to mention.A volunteer army is not a prison. It was difficult to fault the six recruits whorefused the vaccine. It was one thing to advise soldiers going overseas to takethis vaccine, it was quite another to force, or even frighten, every member ofthe military into taking it.INSECTS, POX, AND LETHAL GAS\"Watch out for weapons of mass destruction!\"—Grandpa, on Hey, Arnold! seen on Cartoon Network, January 2004West Nile VirusIn the summer of 2002, the New York Times's prominent coverage of West Nilevirus helped contribute to a growing perception that a huge epidemic might be inthe offing here in the United States. Dr. Lawrence K. Altman wrote in his column\"The Doctor's World\" on August 11, 2002, that \"as West Nile fever spreadsthrough the country ... a virus carves a new ecological niche in a hemispherewhere it has never been seen.\" The choice of words \"spreads through thecountry,\" \"carves,\" and \"hemisphere where it has never been seen\" exaggeratedthe extent of the disease. In fact, there were only 170 cases nationwide withonly 11 deaths at the time of his writing, though the article made it seem likea lot more.On August 16, 2002, Altman's front-page headline read \"Experts Expect Rapid Risein West Nile Virus Cases,\" and theFALSE ALARMlead stated, \"The number of cases of West Nile fever is expected to rise sharplyin the next week. ... If the current epidemic reflects experience, about 10percent of the cases will be fatal.\"Altman's and others' emphasis on fatalities helped provoke fear. West Nile didkill, but it was still a very rare disease. By this time, half the country wasscratching and overheating in fall clothing. People were afraid to go into theirbackyards, expecting to encounter either a dead bird or a killer mosquito. Dr.Lyle Peterson, an epidemiologist at the CDC who is an expert in insect-bornediseases, helped spread the panic by speculating that most patients werehospitalized due to brain swelling, when in fact most people afflicted suffereda mild flu or no symptoms at all.Anthrax narrowed the focus of our fear. After 9/11 we felt vulnerable to attack,and after anthrax we felt vulnerable to infectious agents. West Nile virus wasthe first bug du jour after anthrax, and the American public quickly transferredits unrealistic fear of the mail to a fear of mosquitoes. Each time we gave feara name, there was a hope we could control the threat and thereby control thefear. But with each media-driven infection, our fear was soon well out ofproportion to the actual risk. We had seen bird viruses of the same class(arboviruses) transmitted from the east to the west by mosquitoes before, yet wehad never responded with the trepidation we felt for West Nile virus. These wereviruses with a risk of sickness and death, but so were the other arbovirusesthat didn't scare us nearly as much as West Nile did.There were cases of West Nile virus in 1999, 2000, and 2001, but it wasn't untilafter anthrax drew our attention to bacteria and viruses in 2002 that we beganto worry about West Nile virus. The number of cases was on the rise, but hardlyenough to justify the sudden hysteria.What Is West Nile Virus?West Nile virus is transmitted among wild birds by the Culex pip-iens mosquito,otherwise known as the southern house mosquito.INSECTS, POX, AND LETHAL GASIt has traditionally been found in Africa, the Middle East, southern Europe, andAsia.In humans, it frequently causes a fever without involving the brain, though itoccasionally causes meningitis or brain swelling (encephalitis), especially inthe very young and the very old. It is commonly associated with muscle aches, arash on the trunk, headaches, and lymph node swelling, though most people whoare infected have only a mild flu or no symptoms at all.It is very difficult to catch West Nile virus, even in a region where it hasbeen found. Less than 1 percent of Culex mosquitoes in the area have it, andless than 1 percent of those humans bitten by the culprit mosquito becomeseriously ill.There is a vaccine that has been released for use in animals, and one is underinvestigation for use in humans. In the meantime, prevention of West Nile viruscases is best accomplished by removing stagnant water where mosquitoes breed.Sending trucks trundling up and down streets at night, puffing pesticide foginto the air, as was done in the summer of 2002, is an extreme overreaction,since it knocks down mosquito populations for only a few days while killingwildlife, including some insects that kill mosquitoes. Fogging also may injurehumans by aggravating asthma and other lung conditions. Much safer and moreeffective is larviciding, which attacks mosquito breeding sites and habitats.The virus was first discovered in Uganda in 1937, and the first urban epidemicoccurred in 1996 in Bucharest, Romania, with 393 cases, including 17 deaths. Thefirst North American case appeared in 1999, when 62 cases occurred in New YorkCity, 7 of which were fatal.Under a Sudden Media MicroscopeJohn Barry, a scholar at the Center for Bioenvironmental Research, wrote in anop-ed in the New York Times on August 10, 2002, that \"the emergence and spreadof any new disease is something to takeFALSE ALARMseriously, but the reaction to the West Nile virus has been characterized not byseriousness but by hysteria. There has been no rational discussion of the threatand no information given about the likely future course of the disease.\" He wenton to point out that it was really only a marginal threat and that it wassimilar to another mosquito-borne virus, St. Louis encephalitis, which had avariable number of cases every year, with a high of 1,967 in 1975. \"And yetthere has never been a national focus on this disease, no sudden expenditures oftens of millions of dollars, no media feeding frenzy and no talk of declaring astatewide emergency, as happened in Louisiana last week with the outbreak of theWest Nile virus.\"On August 13, 2002, the Chicago Tribune published an editorial, \"Fighting Fearand West Nile,\" which put it in the minority of newspapers that were notoverreacting to the overblown threat. The Tribune laudably stated that \"thealarm—bordering on hysteria—over West Nile virus has thrown many localcommunities into turmoil. Officials report fielding hundreds of phone calls fromworried homeowners who have spotted dead birds or who have been disturbed bymedia reports.\" The Tribune labeled Dr. Julie Gerberding, the director of theCDC, as part of the problem for calling the virus an \"emerging infectiousdisease epidemic,\" despite the fact that medical experts throughout the UnitedStates saw no reason to panic. The Tribune was rightfully more concerned aboutthe effects of the pesticide fogging than from the virus itself. By way ofcomparison, West Nile had killed eleven people so far that summer, whereas theflu kills thirty-six thousand per year.In a letter to the New York Times that August, I wrote, \"The West Nile virus hascaptured the public imagination. It causes a rash and other scary symptoms,including swollen lymph nodes, which other viruses in its class do not exhibit.Surely the virus can be contained through public health measures that have beenuseful in other similar outbreaks. If public information leads to more insectrepellent, longer sleeves and less stagnant water in our backyards, so much thebetter. But more worrisome is the attemptINSECTS, POX, AND LETHAL GASto treat our hysteria with spraying: how much toxic insecticide will it take tocalm our fears? ... As with anthrax, when 30,000 people were treated withantibiotics and only 22 people were afflicted, the greater problem with WestNile is panic.\"West Nile virus stayed in the headlines on the cable news networks and in thenewspapers on into early September. Four transplant recipients appeared to havereceived the virus from donors. This opened up the real possibility that WestNile virus could be transmitted by transfused blood, a prospect that was laterconfirmed.The cable news networks inflated this possibility hysterically, raising thequestion of whether our blood supply was safe. In fact, there was no rapid bloodscreening test for West Nile, but the blood supply was certainly safe. \"Bloodsupply\" is a misnomer, a panic-laden term, since it suggests that a bug cansomehow make its way from one donor into all our transfused blood. There is nosuch reality, as the rule is one donor, one recipient, with no large-scalepooling of transfused blood.Blood transfusions are often lifesaving, and the risks of getting any virus,especially West Nile, that way are very low. Malaria infects ninety-three peopleper year via blood transfusions, and millions every year overall, but malariawas not scaring us, because almost all of its killing took place overseas.Blood transfusion was not a new mode of transmission for West Nile. In fact, itwas expected, since mosquitoes take a blood meal when they bite someone.As of early September, there were still only six hundred cases of West Nilevirus nationwide with thirty-one deaths, though it felt like a lot more, thanksto the media coverage. But the fear began to die out as fall came and mosquitoseason ended.There was no media memory. As West Nile faded in the fall, no one at any networkor any newspaper thought to apologize for overstating the case. There were noretractions, no amendments, just simply no more front-page coverage and no moreheadlines on cable TV.FALSE ALARMThe following summer, 2003, .West Nile was having a slow season. It had infectedover ten thousand horses the year before and now there was an animal vaccine,but this was reported only in a small article in a back section of the WallStreet Journal.West Nile just wasn't on our list in 2003, and we didn't know whether it wasback with a vengeance or not. We no longer heard about how many it killed. Wewere back out in our backyards with our short sleeves and our stagnant water. Wewere thinking about SARS and then the great blackout, followed by the hurricane.In the meantime, West Nile virus made an appearance in the western Plainsstates, and the CDC reported 6,411 cases of it, with 134 deaths. But we were nolonger afraid of West Nile in 2003, and no one was paying attention. The mediaeye was focused elsewhere.SmallpoxMedicine depends on probabilities: the probability of a disease occurring, thelikelihood that it will spread or can be prevented, and the odds of a sideeffect coming from the prevention or treatment. A risk/benefit analysis weighsthe risk of a disease against the risk of the intervention.With smallpox, the greatest problem in the fall and winter of 2002 was anexaggerated sense of risk on all sides. The smallpox scare was a new category ofabsurd overreaction when compared with the previous public health hypes. Herewas a disease that was being hyped even though it hadn't made anyone sick in theUnited States in over fifty years. Yet the public had to contend with twoopposing fears: fear of smallpox and fear of the vaccine.True, in its day, smallpox was a debilitating disease that left disfiguringscars. When untreated, it had a 30 percent mortality rate. But it mainly spreadperson to person by inhaled droplet after a victim was already showing feversand obvious skin lesions and so was easily isolated. It had been fullyeradicated here in the United States in 1949, and from the entire planet in the1970s, when the immunization program ceased.INSECTS, POX, AND LETHAL GASNevertheless, in 2002, scientists and public health officials were talking aboutthe ravages of smallpox as if it were a current problem, a running commentarythat needlessly spread fear.Smallpox, the WeaponKen Alibek, the former deputy director of Biopreparat, the Soviet biologicalweapons apparatus, admitted to the existence of large amounts of smallpox in theformer Soviet Union, so there was reason to believe that some of the stockpiledvirus might have found its way into the hands of rogue dictators or terrorists.The risk of smallpox appearing in the United States was theoretical, yet themedia—followed by the public—grew rapidly afraid of it. The amorphous sense ofundefined danger contributed to the growing fear. David Goldston, a staffer onthe House Science Committee, pointed out to me in late 2002 that \"it's difficultto weigh the risks since the government hasn't given out information about therisks, even to the panel advising it on vaccination policy.\"In 1797, when Edward Jenner invented the first smallpox vaccine by injecting itsviral cousin, cowpox, into a human, he surely never dreamt his work would leadto a vaccination controversy more than two hundred years later. Yet in the fallof 2002 we were faced with a medical dilemma: should we vaccinate anyone againsta disease that didn't currently exist? With two vaccines made from killed viruson the horizon—one of which was undergoing trials at the National Institutes ofHealth—should we use the outdated and more dangerous live-virus vaccine at all?And if so, who should receive it? Was anyone truly at risk?The old live virus (Jennerian) vaccine had been quite useful at a time whenvaccination still made sense. \"It offers excellent protection,\" said Dr. MartinBlaser, an infectious disease specialist. \"It is the reason why smallpox is nolonger circulating in the world.\" This vaccine used a related virus (vaccinia)that was much weaker than smallpox but could occasionally cause skin problems,brainFALSE ALARMswelling, or could spread to patient contacts. It was also not safe to give itto someone who was either pregnant or without a working immune system.Few talked about the newer, killed-virus vaccines. One of these vaccines hadbeen given safely to over 300,000 people in Japan while smallpox was in theprocess of being eradicated there. The other—the vaccine the NIH wasstudying—had been given safely to 100,000 people in Turkey. The CDC Web sitelisted these facts, but then went on to call these vaccines untested. Were theonly tests that mattered to our scientists those that involved Americans? Workwas also proceeding on a third state-of-the-art recombinant vaccine, wheresmallpox DNA was produced using a bacteria such as E. coli. Recombinant vaccineswere generally the safest and were used for hepatitis and other viruses. It waslikely that one would soon be developed for smallpox.The smallpox fearmongers maintained that, if it did occur here in the UnitedStates, it would probably spread first within the hospitals that were attemptingto treat it. This was why during the smallpox hype of 2002, hospitals were atthe center of the controversy. Some wanted the old vaccine, but most wererefusing it. But of course it was difficult to apply any kind of meaningful riskanalysis to hospitals in the absence of actual smallpox. Lacking was a publichealth strategy to help the public see this theoretical risk in perspective.The Specter of an Ancient ScourgeAs an ancient scourge, smallpox captures the dark side of our imaginations.Schoolchildren learn of it as the first bioweapon, distributed in blankets toNative American tribes by British troops during the French and Indian wars ofthe 1750s.Yet in modern times smallpox never wiped out large populations at once the wayinfluenza did. Smallpox had always been containable by public health measures.The vaccination program of the 1960s was undertaken largely to eradicate thediseaseINSECTS, POX, AND LETHAL GASworldwide and not because there was looming risk to a particular group.The old smallpox vaccine has too many side effects to be used just to treatfear. The stockpiling of hundreds of thousands of doses of this old relic thatbegan in late 2002 was excessive and unjustified.By October of 2002, an absurd debate was raging about who should get thesmallpox vaccine and who shouldn't. The New York Times reported on October 16,2002, that \"a panel of specialists advising the government on smallpoxvaccinations recommended today offering the immunization to an estimatedhalf-million emergency room and other hospital workers because of thepossibility of a bioterrorist attack.\" This recommendation seemed arbitrarygiven that there was no reason to expect an imminent attack.Over the next few months, the debate continued to rage: fear of smallpox versusfear of the vaccine. Finally, on December 13, President Bush veered from hisprevious pronouncements and stated in a speech that he was not recommending theold smallpox vaccinations for the entire population.But at the end of 2002, the public was still riddled with unrealisticexpectations concerning smallpox. In mid-December the New England Journal ofMedicine released a survey showing that 65 percent of the population stillbelieved that everyone should be vaccinated now! It was unfortunate to have torespond to this hysteria by continuing to magnify the small risks of thevaccine, countering one set of fears with another.Before too much vaccinating could go on, smallpox faded from the limelightaltogether and was replaced by the next bug du jour. If we finally came to seesmallpox in perspective, it was only because something else took its place.Nine months later, in October 2003, a little-noticed article appeared in USAToday, entitled \"Smallpox Vaccination Plan 'Ceased.'\" Anita Manning reported,\"Less than a year after President Bush announced a smallpox vaccination plan toprotectFALSE ALARMAmericans in the event of a terrorist attack, a fraction of the expected numberof health workers have been immunized and the much ballyhooed program is dead inthe water.\"Ray Strikas, the director of smallpox preparedness and response at the CDC,issued this update. He believed that \"the pace of vaccinations had droppeddramatically in April after well-publicized reports of unexpected heart problemsassociated with the vaccine.\"So the CDC shipped 291,400 doses, but only 38,549 people were vaccinated, asignificant waste. In fact, the whole smallpox preparedness program costbillions of dollars. Homeland Security Department spokesman Brian Roehrkassesaid that the plan of vaccinating first responders had accomplished what it setout to do, but this seemed like a ridiculous assertion under the circumstances.Money foolishly spent was becoming an identifying feature of a bug du jour.Chemical WeaponsWith the war with Iraq fast approaching in early 2003, terror alerts beganappearing on our cable news screens like potholes on a high-speed highway. Theconcern was easy to trace: the Bush administration was focusing on the UNreports stating that large quantities of chemical and biological weapons wereunaccounted for in Iraq. The prevailing rhetoric lumped all these weaponstogether under the ominous banner \"Weapons of Mass Destruction,\" ignoring thegreat variance from one potential agent to the next.In a scenario analogous to that of the bug du jour, the Bush administrationcreated a link in early 2003 with our personal security here at home andsuggested that these weapons could somehow be smuggled over here in large enoughquantities to imperil our personal safety.But this was fear perception, not real risk. Our expectation was pushed to anall-time high. We were thousands of miles away, yet we were told we were undersiege. President Bush maintainedINSECTS, POX, AND LETHAL GASthat he would send the troops over there and eradicate the threat, eliminate thedanger, before more terrorists could come here and get us.In coordination with this expectation, the terror alerts began a month beforethe Iraq war.Clothes for the ThyroidWhile most of the focus in early 2003 was on chemical weapons, occasionallyfalse fears of nuclear terrorism were trumpeted. Bizarrely, this was accompaniedby an obsession with protecting the thyroid with potassium iodide pills. Scamcompanies were mass marketing and Internet spamming these pills—with theunsubstantiated claim that they had prevented thyroid cancer in Chernobyl insome children who had been serendipitously taking them at the time of thenuclear accident there.In the event of a nuclear attack or terrorist-provoked plant accident, thetheory is that if the thyroid fills up on potassium iodide, it won't have roomto take up radiation, and so will be partly protected from fallout. But morecrucial organs, including the heart, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and bonemarrow, will still be at risk. Taking this pill in the event of a nuclear attackor accident is like a man going out into a snowstorm wearing only a scarf.As with Cipro, with potassium iodide scams, people may hoard pills that theywill then be too quick to use.On Call for FearIn early February 2003, when the terror alert was elevated to orange for thefirst time, people were petrified, and the specter was rising of chemicalweapons threatening us from hidden places in Iraq.It was interesting the way the media helped to generate fear and then went abouttrying to rein it in, as though TV was simultaneously sensationalistic and inthe business of public service.FALSE ALARMThe NBC Today show's Ann .Curry told me intensely off camera that we needed togive effective advice to people feeling stress. On camera I suggested thatpeople forget about duct tape, antibiotics, and other specific preparations.Israel coped with daily terrorist threats by going about \"business as usual.\"Here in the United States people could continue with their regular dailyactivities, focus on things besides the alerts, which, over time, would seemless traumatic. If worry about losing everything caused people to cherish theirloved ones, I said, that at least was a good thing.In my medical office, I began receiving the same worried phone calls from mypatients that I had received during the fall of 2001. They told me they were notsleeping, were thinking constantly about bombs, or were rushing to buy emergencysupplies. In the months after September 11, many of my patients had desperatelysought gas masks and Cipro. In February 2003 these same patients were buyingduct tape and plastic sheeting.In Israel, most people are able to live relatively normal lives despite frequentsuicide bombings and constant military conflict. Statistically, a walk to thesupermarket in Israel is still far more likely to be uneventful than unsafe. Forthose in Israel who are well adjusted, the threat gradually begins to seem lessimminent and more in keeping with the statistical likelihood of terrorismactually taking place. But even Israel is not completely immune. The sense ofthreat remains just below the surface, and it wears at people's good health.In New York City in 2003, many people were more irritable or angry than usual.Such anxiety could come in different forms— including a racing heart, shortnessof breath, chest pain, or indigestion. Such patients needed to seek out theirphysicians for evaluation and perhaps sedatives.Risks and probabilities are the prime tools of the medical trade, used to assessthe chances of a certain disease occurring. In 2003, as the fear of terrorismlingered, these medical tools became more useful in countering the hype.INSECTS, POX, AND LETHAL GASChoose Your PoisonThe threat we face from chemical terrorist attacks has been greatly exaggerated.Nerve gas is very difficult to produce and to distribute; moreover, itdissipates rapidly. For example, sarin gas, when it was released in thejam-packed Tokyo subway system in 1995, spread a lot more fear than gas. (Only adozen people actually died during that attack.) Unfortunately, mediadescriptions of sarin as a colorless, odorless gas that causes visualdisturbance, seizures, and difficulty breathing cast it as a primal threat. Ithas an antidote—atropine, which has to be injected right away into the thigh orthe heart in order to be effective. But actually keeping atropine close at handjust in case of an attack is more likely to lead a person to accidentalself-injection rather than self-protection.VX gas stays around longer and can stick to the skin, enter the pores, and blockthe nerves—but it would be just about impossible for clouds of VX gas to blowthrough the streets. A delivery system that could expose a massive number ofcitizens to nerve gas without the gas being destroyed by heat or dissipated bywind simply doesn't exist. Duct tape and plastic sheets? To protect us fromwhat? How is a terrorist going to bring VX gas to my door?In early 2003, pictures of the old World War I killers, lewisite and mustardgas, blistering agents, were being spliced from our old high school historybooks and indiscriminately broadcast on our cable TV screens. Vats of theselethal gases had been found previously in Iraq, the worry went.Lewisite is colorless and smells like geraniums. Mustard gas is colorless andsmells like horseradish. They cause the eyes and the skin and the lungs to burn.There is an antidote (British anti-lewisite), and one can quickly flush the skinwith water or bleach. But who in the world needs this antidote?Fear causes us to mythologize these weapons, which have already taken onenlarged significance in our imagination because some have been used in the pastfor evil purposes.FALSE ALARMThe preparations for an imagined attack—unlikely as it is—create a great deal ofanxiety. And holding a gas mask or a roll of duct tape or a box of Cipro in yourhands does not provide reassurance to a rational person.\"When do I use this tape or this gas mask?\" my patients asked me in early 2003.\"You don't,\" I replied.Duct tape to keep out nerve gas is far more likely to lie idle than to protectsomeone. A chemical suit and gas mask offer 100 percent protection, but they mayalso suffocate you if used improperly.We fear terrorism in part because it is unpredictable. Cold War fears wereeasier to track and were tied to a single enormously visible enemy, the SovietUnion. During the forty-five years of the Cold War, we had time to adapt tothese fears and to build up psychological defenses to them. In contrast, thefear of terrorism is a fear with an ever-changing face.Talking over the radio about these trumped-up fears in the spring of 2003 had asurreal quality for me. Brian Lehrer's WNYC studio observed a library-likesilence for his hourlong show on terrorism fears. Mittenlike headphonesenveloped our ears as we spoke an inch away from the large felt microphones.It wasn't obvious to host and listeners, but human fear is too often basedsolely on our imaginations.Ask Doctor MarcReaders of my Ask Dr. Marc column in the Nation shared their obsessions with me:From Springdale, Pennsylvania: If a chemical or biological weapon were used inthe United States, how long would the agent persist in the environment* Wouldsealing windows and doors with plastic sheeting and duct tape keep the germs orchemicalsINSECTS, POX, AND LETHAL GASout long enough for the agent to be cleaned or diluted to nonlethal levels?Dr. Marc: Certainly, beware of a mailman in a full bodysuit and gas mask.Otherwise, I recommend going about your daily business. Chemical agents such assarin would dissipate in minutes on their own long before they reached yourduct-taped door. Even if by some unlucky miracle you were right nearby, yourbest bet would be to leave the area. As far as germs go, anthrax isn'tcontagious, smallpox spreads very slowly, and bubonic-plague infection requiresfleas. Homeland Security notwithstanding, I can't imagine a scenario where itwould be essential to duct tape yourself inside a room.From San Bruno, California: Assume that you could seal a 10' x 20' x 8' room sothat it's airtight, which as a general contractor I think I can do. How longwould it be before lack of oxygen or buildup of C0 2 becomes a problem for twopeople?Dr. Marc: C0 2 is such a noxious gas, maybe terrorists should consider it. Inthe airtight room you describe, C0 2 would overcome you in a matter of hours,long before a terrorist could reach you with sarin.From Durango, Colorado: If we were to create a \"safe room\" in our house withduct tape, etc., how would we determine when to come out, and how would we dealwith the contaminated environment from that point on?Dr. Marc: If you're concerned about a contaminated environment, well, we alreadylive in one, yet few of us have chosen to go into a \"safe room\" and live out ourlives there. Imagine what would happen if we all put our safe rooms together andmade a safe world.FALSE ALARMFrom an unidentified location:-Even asking what we should do to protectourselves against a chemical attack plays into Bush's fear-mongering agenda. Themore scared Americans are, the easier it will be to scrap civil liberties andprosecute the \"endless war\" Bush has talked about. I think acting as if thepossibility of a chemical attack is great enough to be discussed in the Nationactually unwittingly gives momentum to the Bush agenda.Dr. Marc: I'd argue that it's better to oppose the fearmongering than to ignoreit. Correcting misinformation, providing perspective, countering fear withprobability, and learning the real risks: these are treatments for the conditionof hysteria that our government has helped to foster. We are not powerless. Wecan resist being mobilized by fear, first, by realizing that isolated terroristacts can't defeat us and, second, by puncturing propaganda like the emptyballoon it is.The Guide to FearIn its 2003 manual New Yorker's Guide to Terrorism Preparedness and Response:Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear , the American Council ofScience and Health extended its worst-case scenarioing to chemical weapons.Lewisite, mustard, arsine, cyanide, phosgene, sarin, tabin, VX, and many morewere described in excruciating detail: what to do, what antidotes to take, howto protect oneself, all thoroughly described. Of course, in most cases therereally isn't much a person can do, which gave the manual a morbid tone.Manuals such as this one belong on the shelf, as they provoke fear and obsessivethinking about dangers that remain remote. Too much detailed informationinvariably carries with it the agenda that something is in the offing.Otherwise, what is the point of the manual? What is the point of gearing up,pulse rate rising, for something that either isn't going to happen or that wecan't do much about?INSECTS, POX, AND LETHAL GASInstead of relying on how-to manuals that provoke the public, preparation for anunlikely event should go on behind the scenes. Public health experts can helpour leaders stockpile real perspective instead of perishable antibiotics,vaccines, and preparation kits. Leaders and their scientific advisers need tolearn restraint; they need to stop justifying their programs by launchingcampaigns of hype that cause people to feel endangered all the time.SARSIt seemed . . . very easy to paint the worst-case scenario. I thought aboutthis, how our minds naturally jump to picture the negative outcome and stallthere. It is because the mind is frozen by fear, and fear overwhelms hope.—Jerome Groopman, M.D., The Anatomy of HopeIn April 2003 up rose SARS to grab the media megaphone. SARS, or Severe AcuteRespiratory Syndrome, brought the panic over a potential infection to a newlevel. The global health alert and travel advisories that were meant to inhibitthe dissemination of the virus also spread virulent fear by word of mouth.Public health agencies raised the stakes, then presumptively took credit for theresolution of the problem.The government sounded its note of preparedness, wanting to seem proactive inanother public panic situation where it was actually being reactive. The CDC,which had lost credibility with the anthrax bungle, rallied publicly with SARSand quarantined entire sections of the planet in response to a virus thatdemonstrated seven thousand cases worldwide. The CDC and the World142SARSHealth Organization (WHO) used fear to provoke compliance, talking aboutworst-case scenarios and viral mutations, and alarming the whole WesternHemisphere with a few cases that flew around a Toronto hotel.But no one died of SARS in the United States in 2003, and people eventually grewtired of hearing about it. The CDC and the World Health Organization hadrestricted travel to and from Asia and Toronto based on the assumption that airtravel could allow an emerging contagion to spread more easily. This theory wasneither proven nor disproven. In fact, historically, isolating an afflictedpatient has always been much more effective than quarantining a region. Thisprinciple had held true for plague, influenza, and many other contagiousthreats. People as they panic from an imposed quarantine can spread a bug. It ishuman nature to run away from perceived risk and human nature to make commonmistakes when engaged in overinflated, hypervigilant activity. People who faceheavy stigmatizing for being a suspected disease carrier are likely to losetheir common sense altogether.Nevertheless, when the incidence of SARS died down (as many emerging viruses haddone before it), the health organizations were quick to give the credit to theirworldwide advisory.The ChokeholdBack in early April 2003, President Bush granted Secretary of Health and HumanServices Tommy Thompson the right to quarantine for SARS, thus giving a nudge tothe trend that was spreading panic around the globe.In its more than fifty years of existence, the WHO had never before issued atravel advisory or enacted a global surveillance network, as it did with SARS.In the United States, meanwhile, the CDC was publicly analyzing everyconceivable case—another unprecedented reaction. SARS was a legitimate concern,but the response was being carried to an extreme. By April, the virus hadFALSE ALARMinfected about two thousand people worldwide and killed fewer than one hundred,compared to the yearly average influenza death toll of thirty-six thousand inthe United States alone.What was going on medically? The answer was complex, since the SARS corona viruswas a cousin to the common cold, which spreads easily via sneezing or eventouch. But whereas the cold was countered by most people's immune systems, SARSwas new so our bodies hadn't yet had time to produce antibodies to it.On the surface, a strong public health initiative seemed warranted. As JulieGerberding, the director of the CDC, pointed out in the New England Journal ofMedicine, the cooperation of the international scientific community inidentifying the corona virus as the culprit in a matter of weeks was veryimpressive. But Gerberding didn't stop with the scientists. She wrote: \"Evenmore impressive than the speed of scientific discovery in the global SARSoutbreak is the almost instantaneous communication and information exchange thathas supported every aspect of the response.\"But this was problematic. For the most part, the result of all thiscommunication was global panic and economic shutdown that seemed way out ofproportion to the real threat.Yes, the WHO pressure on the Chinese medical authorities to take their heads outof the sand, identify patients, and isolate true cases was impressive. Butbeyond the historically proven method of isolating infected patients, it wasdifficult to tell how much air travel and the mobility now available topeople—and their diseases—increased the mandate for regional embargo. This wasan issue to be considered, but it wasn't an automatic justification forplanetwide sequestration.The CDC appeared to be fully recovered from the public lambasting it hadreceived over anthrax back in 2001. It had given itself a new face, withGerberding as the new director giving speeches and press conferences at anunprecedented rate. SARS was a full-fledged international bug du jour, with newsand mediaSARScoverage beyond any predecessor. The WHO, which had never gotten involved inglobal tracking strategies to this extent before, was weighing in heavily onSARS. In part this was due to improved technology, greater scientificcooperation, and an increased interest in tracking infectious agents because ofconcern over possible bioterrorism.But neither organization was really used to the spotlight, and they weren'tconsidering sufficiently how their reactions might be perceived by a fragilepublic. There was too much emphasis on public statements and not as much onserological testing and antiviral strategies. SARS needed to be cured withlaboratory work, not press conferences. Panic over SARS was public health runamok. All the public posturing took SARS out of its proper context andcontributed to a scare that ultimately did more harm than the virus itself.By focusing only on the worst-case scenarios regarding the spread of SARS, theWorld Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control were in effectcontrolling the populace through fear. This helped to spread worldwide economichavoc— many estimates were that SARS cost over $30 billion to local economiesworldwide. Toronto was cut off by the WHO travel advisory throughout much ofApril 2003.Chinatowns were deserted in all the major cities, and people around the worldwere stigmatizing anyone who came from an Asian country.In contrast to the rest of Asia, Vietnam's careful and quiet isolating ofsuspected patients seemed to be behind its success in limiting the spread of thevirus. Quarantining hospitals where SARS had spread to health care workers, ordesignating certain centers as \"SARS hospitals,\" was at the upper limit of whatseemed reasonable. Monitoring of traffic from countries where SARS had beendiagnosed, or emphasizing careful precautions in such countries, was alsoreasonable but was not the same thing as frightening everyone who may havetraveled there or who wanted to do so.FALSE ALARMThe problem with AIDS information back in the 1980s had been the opposite kindof distortion: affected groups were marginalized, and the prevailing rhetorichad minimized the disease. With SARS, the propaganda was fear, suggesting thateveryone could get it overnight, which was far from the case. This notion had anegative impact on many people. Physician/essayist Abraham Verghese, writing inthe New York Times Magazine, attacked the transparent political agendas that hadbeen applied to bioter-ror preparation but made an invalid assumption that noneof this applied to SARS. Certainly, restricting movement was necessary with aknown killer, but with SARS, people were restricted throughout the spring of2003 just for having a cough. Many life insurance companies wouldn't grant aperson a policy if he'd been anywhere near Asia in the past month. This was avast overreaction.The distinction had to be made between the need for global control of a virusbefore it got out of hand and the political agenda of people wanting to justifytheir jobs and project themselves as soothsayers. The machinery for publicbroadcasting that had been set up for bioterror prevention was being usedindiscriminately for SARS. It was a blind assumption that speaking about SARSincessantly on TV would prevent its spread.Galvanizing FearThe greatest problem with SARS was that once again public health authoritieswere talking only in terms of worst-case scenarios, while striving to commitmassive resources to their agendas. If you approach people where they feel themost vulnerable, as with health care and disease, it is easier to sign them upfor a program purported to be in their interest. This is exactly what governmentofficials do with bioterror to whip up public support for their antiterrorprograms. Make people afraid, make people feel they need you to protect them,and they allow you free rein with your agenda.SARSFor SARS, fear was the central pathogen, where the risks of acquiring the newmutated cold virus were far less than the fear of being infected. Uncertaintyabout what the risk really was promoted the panic—seeing SARS in the news causedus to personalize it. We knew it came from an exotic animal in Asia, but weweren't sure which one, which scared us further.In reality, SARS was a garden-variety respiratory cold virus, nothing sexy,nothing sinister. It was unsettling to consider that all this attention paid toSARS took attention away from influenza and other proven killers. Worldwide,malaria, dengue, and AIDS were diseases that infected millions each year and forwhich the protections in place were woefully inadequate.Meanwhile, here in the United States panic from SARS replaced panic frombioterror, which replaced panic from West Nile virus. All this reactionrepresented resources being taken away from the yearly epidemics in order tofight the latest scare.True, there were some troublesome aspects to SARS. It was a potentiallylife-threatening infection to which we had zero immunity. And for SARS we had noready vaccine, like we did for the flu.The lead question in doctor's offices throughout April 2003 was what peopleshould do to protect themselves against SARS. The answer of course was to doabsolutely nothing. The best vaccine for SARS was information, seeing the newdisease in its context. At the time there were only thirty-five documented casesin the United States, and no one had died. We had to treat the perception thatwe could get SARS rather than any real risk of it. We needed to convert ouruncertainty to a realistic understanding of our chances of getting the disease,which were extremely low for any given individual. Overpersonalization of aminuscule risk spreads panic—and when people panic, they tend to take fewerprecautions.How did a person know if he had SARS? The answer was that if he had a fever,muscle aches, and difficulty breathing, he didnt have SARS, but he probably hadthe flu.FALSE ALARMA Fear of AsiansThe small waiting room in my office three blocks from New York UniversityMedical Center was just as congested as the rest of New York, with patientssitting practically on top of one another. As with the subway, it felt as ifgerms here might spread more quickly than at other places, and I alwayshalf-expected my patients to catch the bug their neighbor was harboring. Butwhether the risk of catching something from another patient was real orimagined, one thing was certain: the stress of living and working in the citymade it seem so. Added to this mix, in the spring of 2003 we had the seeminglytangible risk of SARS. My waiting room was filled with patients, all brimmingwith the same question.\"Could I have SARS?\" a patient blurted out. Unsolicited, an office secretaryreplied, \"You must ask the doctor.\" Meanwhile, the thirteen-inch television setin the middle of the room was playing all SARS all the time and updating mypatients on the virus every hour.An Asian American architect, \"Mr. Ho,\" had come to see me for the first time. Noone sat next to him in the waiting room, and when he coughed, the room emptiedout altogether.In my examination room, Mr. Ho announced that he had just returned from HongKong. He traveled to China and Hong Kong on business every few weeks, butbecause of the effect of the SARS scare on the economy there, he had lost hislatest architectural job and had had to come back. On the plane bringing himhome, he said, no one would sit with him.He came to me with a cough and symptoms of a cold, but no fever, no muscleaches, no difficulty breathing. Hearing this, I wanted to don a mask, but I puton gloves instead. My patient downplayed his symptoms, clearly realizing I—thedoctor—might be worried about SARS.\"It's just a cold,\" he said. \"It was going away, then it came back a little.It's only a tickle.\"Without saying the magic word, I reassured him that what heSARShad sounded not like something sinister but like simple bronchitis. I gave himan antibiotic and sent him home.Afterwards, I was suddenly nervous, thinking of my two young children. Doctorsare not immune to worries about contagion. In my case the concern didn't go awaycompletely until I had taken a shower and irrationally washed away thepsychological remnant of my fear. It was the same thing I used to do for AIDS inthe 1980s, scrubbing my hands after every encounter with every potential AIDSpatient.A week later, Ho returned to the office with a smile rather than a cough. Duringthat week, the specter of SARS had spread through the world more rapidly thaneven the disease itself. Though not a single new case had been reported in ourcity, New Yorkers were increasingly frightened and increasingly wary.Asia was more isolated than before, and Ho had no immediate prospect for workthere. Back in New York, he thought people were taking into account his Asianfeatures and avoiding him on the street. I could actually see this occurring inmy waiting room, where the other patients now deliberately avoided not only himbut anything he touched.So why was Ho smiling? In my consultation room he confessed that he had actuallybeen afraid he had SARS, but now that he knew he didn't, despite the fact thathe was not working, he believed his future was bright.SARS in New York CityNew Yorkers are a nervous bunch to begin with, and our doctors are no exception.Most of us, doctors and patients alike, are med ical Zeligs; like Woody Allen'scharacter, we take on the symptoms and even the personality of the latestthreat. The stress of living in an overcrowded city distorts perceptions in thedirection of fear.The scientific literature analyzing the health of our city's residents showsthat a disproportionately high percentage of New York teenagers suffer fromeating disorders related to a higherFALSE ALARMlevel of stress. The same literature shows that proportionately more adultssuffer from heart disease for the same reason. After studying this phenomenon,the journal Psychosomatic Medicine reported in 1999 that these conditions aredue to the strain of life in New York itself.New Yorkers try to compensate for the pressure we feel by paying more attentionto our symptoms, to every itch and twinge, as if this vigilance might protect usfrom an ever hostile environment. Our fear management is neurotic. Forever onthe verge of panic, we seek out doctors more often and try to use elaboratehealth care safety nets to protect us from the ultimate free fall. The Journalof Urban Health in December 2002 described how New York's megacity has built anelaborate health system.Our megacity also has more media than anywhere else, and so we are more quicklysaturated and prodded by the latest hype. We feel the strain earlier but then weuse our extensive safety net to become desensitized more quickly to the latestbug du jour, only to find ourselves right on the front lines of the next scare.It's a real roller-coaster ride.In the era of SARS fear, we eventually developed a new sort of schtick. ThoughNew Yorkers always cough and kvetch, I'd never heard so much nervous coughingbefore. We always seem to be on the verge of catching something, or if notactually catching something, at least complaining that we might. In the springof 2003, each raspy breath seemed more significant, each sniffling acquaintanceseemed ominously afflicted.My office phone rang continually with respiratory complaints. I knew better thanto counter these concerns with the bald statistic of zero deaths from SARS inthe United States. I didn't want to appear to be downplaying serious potentialrisk even if that risk was remote.After a month of SARS hype, New Yorkers began building up an immunity to thefear.According to the Centers for Disease Control, there were only two probable casesof SARS in New York City by May of 2003,SARScases that ultimately turned out not to be SARS. So our respiratory filtersjoined our gas masks and our stash of antibiotics in our tiny closets.SARS When the Smoke ClearedBy July of 2003, long after it had dropped off the headline news, it wasdetermined that SARS had infected 8,400 people, killing 774 worldwide, with 33probable U.S. cases and no deaths. After analyzing all the data from thisoutbreak, the WHO concluded that SARS is not spread easily through the air, butrequires large respiratory droplets.The Associated Press reported in October that fear over the possible return ofSARS was so great in the United States that even if it didn't appear, the CDCexpected emergency rooms to be swamped with suspected cases. They were concernedthat doctors with limited SARS experience could confuse early SARS with the flu.\"Whether the virus comes back this winter or not, we will be dealing with SARS,\"said Dr. James Hughes, the director of the National Center for InfectiousDiseases of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"When people startshowing up with respiratory diseases, physicians will be thinking of SARS. I cantell you we're more prepared than before,\" Hughes said. \"I think the globalcommunity can handle SARS if it's handled appropriately. I think enough lessonshave been learned\" in the previous outbreak. Research on a vaccine and antiviraltreatments were already underway.As of February 2004, the outbreak still hadn't happened, with only three casesin Asia and none on the North American continent. But the new viral bug du jourwas flu, not SARS. Hughes was wrong. By early 2004, SARS seemed like a distantmemory.We really don't know what stopped the SARS outbreak in spring 2003. It maysimply have run its course. It seems likely that hand washing and isolation ofinfected individuals helped, as theFALSE ALARMTimes suggested in an editorial in early November 2003. But there was no directevidence that the Times was right to conclude that \"such tactics, buttressed byquarantines and restricted air travel, stopped the epidemic last time.\"It clearly cost billions of dollars, and ironically, the Times editorial endedby reversing itself and cautioning the future use of aggressive tactics for SARSwith a \"recognition of the costs of any large-scale shutdown of normalactivities.\"But thanks to SARS hysteria, the apparatus was now in place for massiveworldwide overreactions. If a disease died down, the health organizations andthe media would take credit for its defeat without a true scientific study toprove they were right. If a disease seemed to get out of hand, the news mediawould continue to report it without ever acknowledging the way they—the media—were instantly altering the public's sense of risk.In China, Zhong Nanshan, a scientist who had dealt with the first SARS outbreak,had a more practical plan. He urged people just to avoid spitting in public andeating wild animals.11FLU\"The fear in the hearts of people just withered them,\" said Susanna Turner, ahospital volunteer. \"They were afraid to go out, afraid to do anything. ... Ifyou asked a neighbor for help, they wouldn't do so because they weren't takingany chances.\"—John Barry, The Great Influenza: The Epic Story of the Deadliest Plague inHistoryTV DocsIn early December 2003, TV and radio across the country relentlessly covered the\"flu outbreak.\" Practicing physicians appeared on multiple stations to respondto sudden concerns.Marvin Scott, the WB11 weekend anchor in New York, a man with a classic sonorousTV voice, a square chin, and the pockmarks of a veteran newsman, seemed insultedthat I didn't recognize him.He rushed into my pale blue consultation room on the winter-cold afternoon ofDecember 10 with his cameraman and his agenda ready. Some children had died, andhe seemed to want me to say that all parents should be concerned. His firstquestion was about what parents should be doing to protect their kids.FALSE ALARMI cautioned that parents shouldn't overreact. The sniffles your child complainedof might well be the common cold, whereas flu tends to manifest itself withsudden high fevers, chills, severe muscle aches, and headaches.\"Eleven children have died in one state,\" he said dramatically. \"The number isclimbing. Is this an epidemic?\"Scott's questions wouldn't go on TV, only my answers, wrapped together in asixty-second sound bite. It was important for me not to utter a single phrasethat might play into the hype. I told him that young deaths were clearly atragedy, but not an epidemic.\"Should parents be keeping their kids out of schools?\"\"Parents should be encouraging hand washing and should always keep sick kids athome. But flu is far from widespread enough to consider closing schools.\"\"What should parents do?\"\"All day long my office telephone rings with nervous parents wanting to get flushots for their kids.\" \"What do you tell them?\"\"I tell parents that flu shots are not strictly necessary unless their kids haveasthma or another chronic illness.\"By the time he left my office, Marvin Scott seemed calmer. He had a hype bias,but he was open to fresh facts.It was true that children were dying—twenty or thirty by December 12. How manythe total number would be wasn't yet known. Still, the danger to any of us orour kids remained far less than it seemed.Flu perception was far worse than the reality. Here is what I told my patients:schools closed for blizzards, not flurries. Our 2003 flu was a flurry, not astorm. Since we were on a heightened flu alert, we were likely to mistake everycough or sneeze for that bad bug, but doctors could usually tell whether theirpatients were overreacting or actually required immediate attention.FLUThe Yearly OutbreakBefore 2003, flu was an underappreciated ho-hum domestic killer. It wastraditionally robbed of the attention it deserved by the latest bug du jour.Thirty-six thousand people died of the flu in the United States yearly, but manydidn't get the vaccine who should have. In previous years, the flu simply didn'tworry enough people.In the fall of 2003, all of that changed overnight, as talking-head doctors toldTV viewers why they should worry: it was an earlier season then usual, a worseflu bug than usual, and the vaccine didn't really cover this flu, which appearedto be a killer of children. But the true epidemic was not from flu virus but flufear.The CDC and the WHO, now assuming the go-to position with every potentialcontagion, once again seized the media megaphone as soon as a few childrenstarted to die of flu in late November. I received hundreds of phone calls fromhealthy patients demanding the flu shot, a vaccine that was rapidly becomingscarce. One healthy young patient, whom I hadn't seen in over two years, calledurgently for a shot because her sister was afraid to let her visit the newbornbaby two days hence without one. I was able to slow her down only by pointingout that two days wasn't sufficient time for the shot to work. Even at theheight of the concern, no one knew whether the flu season was going to be anyworse than in prior years, when the media paid little attention.Scares One Group, Kills AnotherWhile 70 to 80 million had received the flu vaccine the year before in theUnited States, another 70 million were advised to receive it but didn't. Healthcare workers, those with respiratory or chronic illnesses, pregnant women, theelderly, and anyone who might come in close contact with the flu are on theCDC's recommended list to be vaccinated. Influenza affects 20 percent of theU.S. population in a given year, and over 200,000 people are hospitalized onFALSE ALARMaverage. The yearly flu vaccine is generally 40 to 60 percent effective atpreventing the flu."},{"pageContent":"The Centers for Disease Control reported 85 million doses of the vaccineavailable in 2003, as the vaccine manufacturers based their year's supply on theprevious year's usage. In 2002, they had had to discard over 10 million unuseddoses, and they weren't about to repeat that costly move in 2003. This way ofdetermining supply inevitably led to a shortage in a year when the devastatingdeaths were broadcast and hyped by the media. By early December 2003, peoplewere clamoring for the vaccine even as supplies of it ran short.The World Health Organization has a global influenza surveillance systeminvolving 112 regional influenza centers. These centers study the early patternsof the year's flu in Asia and South America. The WHO then makes its best guessof what the predominant strains would be here and makes up the vaccine for themost common serotypes. Unfortunately in 2003, the Fujian strain of influenza A,which was going to cause a lot of the havoc, wasn't included in the vaccinebecause of difficulty getting it to reproduce in the culture medium.Flu HistoryThe flu is an ancient scourge, tracing its origins back at least to the days ofHippocrates, who recorded an outbreak of an illness that began with a cough,followed by pneumonia and other symptoms, at Perinthus in ancient Greece in 400B.C.There were several pandemics (disease spreading widely over a large region) inthe eighteenth century, but the most massive outbreak ever occurred in 1918,when more people in the world died of the Spanish flu (50 million) than died inWorld War I, with over 600,000 deaths from the flu in the United States alone.In 1968, the Hong Kong flu killed 700,000 people worldwide, and this may wellhave set us up for the swine flu panic of 1976, when the outbreak wasn't large,but the rush vaccination programFLUled to 100,000 cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome, a form of paralysis. Luckily,the current version of the flu vaccine is much safer than the one used in 1976.A pandemic occurs when a new strain of influenza is created by mutation andspecies-jumping from bird or pig to human. Influenza experts agree that anotherpandemic is likely to happen at some point. Epidemiological models project thatin industrialized countries alone, the next such scourge is likely to result in57 million to 132 million outpatient visits and 1 million to 2.3 millionhospitalizations, and 280,000 to 650,000 deaths over less than two years, or atleast five to ten times what we tend to experience in an average flu year.However, these models don't take into sufficient account that a quicklydeveloped vaccine may slow spread. A \"herd immunity\" may also have occurred fromprior vaccination or exposure to similar flu strains.The impact of the next flu blight is likely to be greatest in developingcountries where health care resources are strained and the general population isweakened by poor health and nutrition. So the WHO and the CDC work at expandingthe flu surveillance and containment network.One reason for the potential panic out of proportion to the risk is that it isalmost impossible to predict when this pandemic might occur. The event occursonly about once in fifty years, but the more we see it discussed in the media,the more we personalize the uncertainty, convincing ourselves irrationally thatevery year will be the year.The Making of a Bug du JourBefore 2003, flu was underappreciated. It was a widely held, yet poorly actedupon, public health perception that we needed more vaccinations, more isolationof those who were sick, and more hand washing. When I first saw flu hit theheadlines, I hoped that the sudden attention would shed light on these basicprecautions. Unfortunately, the flu scare of 2003 did not necessarily lead toFALSE ALARMproper prevention, but as with all bugs du jour, it involved significantexpense.By mid-December, influenza had completed its transition from ho-hum killer towhopping bug du jour. By December 12, it was all over the Internet that the fluhad spread to all fifty states. Flu did this every year, though usually notuntil January, and in previous years most people who didn't have the flu paidlittle attention.Dr. Julie Gerberding, the director of the CDC, was the official spokesperson forthe flu, as she had been for every bug du jour since anthrax. She seemed to havegained at least some insight since SARS and was now attempting to be the voiceof reason. Still, as always, she addressed the phenomenon without acknowledgingthat the perception of a scourge was a media creation. \"I think what we'reseeing is a natural response to concerns about a serious flu season,\" she saidon December 12 on NBC's Today show. \"But we also need to remember that foralmost everyone, flu is not such a serious disease. We don't need to panic orassume that the worst-case scenario is going to happen to everyone. Most of uswill get through this fine,\" she said.Meanwhile, thousands all over the country lined up for flu shots wherever theycould find them, mostly in response to the spreading fear. The federalgovernment announced that it was scrambling to ship 100,000 adult vaccine dosesto combat the shortages, hoping to head off what they felt could become one ofthe worst flu outbreaks in years, and 150,000 child vaccines were expected inJanuary. The government, by wanting to show that it was preparing, helped spreadthe sense of urgency. Around the country, schools began to shut down. Emergencyrooms were filling with sick children, many of whom just had colds. Doctors'offices were forced to turn away droves of people seeking flu shots. An Internetpoll of 30,000 people reported 57 percent who said nothing more could be done,but 43 percent who felt this vaccine didn't offer adequate protection. Both ofthe vaccine manufacturers, Chiron and Aventis, had shipped their entire supply,though Aventis had set aside 250,000 doses that it was giving to the CDCFLUfor distribution. The CDC also managed to procure 375,000 more doses from GreatBritain.Gerberding said the CDC was recommending doctors give high-risk groups toppriority for shots.Despite the severity of the early outbreak, health experts were still not ableto predict just how bad the flu season would be! The season could still just bepeaking early.Surprise EndingIn mid-December, the government continued its rush to find extra vaccine doses(as it had in 1976) to help quell the panic it had helped to create. Dr. WaltOrenstein, the director of the CDC's National Immunization Program, fanned thefear flames by announcing that this was still looking like a bad flu season forchildren. Ninety-two children die in an average flu year. It was still too earlyto tell whether this number would be exceeded in the 2003-2004 season, thoughparents everywhere, fueled by media hype, continued to act like it.The buzz among doctors was that it was highly unusual for healthy children to bedying from this flu. This unscientific observation, though it concerned only afew dozen patients nationwide, helped to spread the panic. Then suddenly, thenews media stopped reporting on the flu. The CDC was just starting to use theword epidemic when the media showed its attention deficit and veered away.The flu willies of 2003 were actually treated inadvertently by the capture ofSaddam Hussein. On the morning of December 14, 2003, Paul Bremer, the U.S.administrator of Iraq, announced, \"Ladies and gentlemen, we got him.\" Themessage was that because this evil man had been captured, the world was bydefinition much safer. The news media broadcast this central message for morethan a week to the exclusion of any fear messages. The famous video footage ofSaddam's mouth yielding to a tongue depressor replaced all images of sickchildren lying on hospital gurneys. The sense of relief we felt carried over tomany aspects of our lives. WeFALSE ALARMwent through a \"feeling safe\" week and lumped the flu into the group of thingswe were automatically feeling safer from. Flu was displaced from the headlines,so we stopped thinking about it. It briefly seemed as if nothing deadly at allcould take place now that the world's worst monster was in custody.Seeing safety in these simplistic terms—that the world, with a broken-downSaddam snaked out of his hole, was suddenly safe where it hadn't been before—wasa distortion, a perversion of the facts. It was as if the military'saccomplishment was somehow a cure for all our ills, and for all potential ills,including influenza.In reality, we were no more and no less susceptible to the risk of this year'sflu than the day before Saddam's capture when the flu was all over the Internet,the Associated Press, and the top of the cable shows' news cycles 24/7. Thesudden transition from palpable panic to utter disregard served to underline theextent to which our fears were manipulated and were ultimately unrelated toactual dangers.\"There is no firm line dividing what's an epidemic and what's not an epidemic,\"Gerberding emphasized on December 19, when people were no longer listening. \"ButI think when you look at maps with widespread activity in thirty-six states, weregard it from a commonsense perspective as an epidemic.\" The CDC said itsemergency operations center had been up and running for two weeks, but ratherthan be alarmed by this announcement, the media barely covered it, and thosepeople who knew about it ignored it.Anthrax, West Nile virus, and SARS had driven people wild with worry whileactually killing fewer than a thousand people combined in the WesternHemisphere. Influenza, a proven killer of thirty-six thousand people per year inthe United States alone, was first ignored, then obsessed over, and then ignoredagain.If there was a silver lining to all this fear-induced distortion, it was thatincreased public awareness might help the health care system contain the flu inthe future—provided that some awareness of the real disease remained once theroving eye of the media had moved on.12COWS, BIRDS, AND HUMANSWhen it comes to scares, to paraphrase an old proverb, reports of exaggeratedrisks can be halfway around the world before the truth gets its boots on. . . .The key here is to make our own decisions based on science, not fear. ... If weonly spent as much time focusing on real, significant risks (for example,cigarette smoking, skipping our influenza vaccine, overexposure to sunlight,etc.) as we do to a minuscule risk like BSE in beef, our nation would be evenhealthier than we are today.—Dr. Elizabeth Whelan, president of the American Council on Science and Health,in the New York Sun, December 26, 2003Mad Cow DiseaseIn late December 2003, as the excitement and the safe feeling over the captureof Saddam Hussein were ebbing, a new bug du jour was surfacing. While at thetime we Americans tried to downplay terror, calling the multicolored alerts the\"boy who cried wolf,\"FALSE ALARMwe became instantly afraid of beef—all because of a single infected cow. Humanswere reacting like Esther Sabban's stressed rats; the suppression of one fearled to an exaggerated response to the next perceived danger that came along.Since 9/11, we have tended to panic over each conceivable contagion.With mad cow disease, we were getting a taste of our own medicine. For over adecade we had banned European beef from our shores, cautioned our people not toeat meat when they traveled there, and refused even to allow our travelers todonate blood when they returned here. In May 2003, when a single case of mad cowdisease appeared in Canada, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)immediately banned all Canadian cattle from crossing our border. Now, when asingle U.S. cow was discovered—after it had already been killed and used forbeef—to have mad cow disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE), over adozen other countries, including meat-careful Japan and Korea, banned our beef.The entire world was petrified of mad cow disease, for reasons that I willexplain later in this chapter. Canada quickly paid us back, banning our beefimmediately m much the same way we had banned theirs earlier in the year. TheUSDA wanted to claim that this sick cow had somehow crossed the border fromCanada into Washington State, but at first no one believed them. By the timethey managed to show that indeed this cow had infiltrated us from Alberta, itwas too late—hysteria had hit and we were branded.The New York Times, which had practically ignored the flu willies two weeksbefore, perhaps because they hadn't broken the story in the first place, was allover this one, front-paging it every day for most of the week, giving a historyof mad cow in Britain, tracing the effects on the meat industry, and detailingthe USDAs paltry attempts to safeguard the meat we ate.At the same time, cattle growers, industry representatives, and the agriculturesecretary, Ann Veneman, went out of their way to assure Americans of thecontinued safety of American beef. Their assurances were justified in terms ofthe extremely low risk of madCOWS, BIRDS, AND HUMANScow, though by the time the results came back on the few cows they did test forBSE, the cows had already been made into hamburgers and hot dogs that werezooming toward people's dinner plates.This single case of mad cow exposed the holes in the American system of meatproduction and disease testing. We were right to be concerned about the safetyof our beef, though we were misdirected toward mad cow disease. The sickHolstein that prompted the panic hadn't been able to walk, yet like so manyother downer cows, it hadn't been tested or banned before slaughter.Once again, discovering the holes in one of our protective nets helped make usfeel unsafe.In 2002, according to Secretary Veneman, the USDA inspected only 20,526 cattleout of a herd of 35 million. In contrast, Japan tested all its cows, 1.2 millionin 2002, and in Western Europe, they tested all cattle over two years old, allsick cattle, and a small screening percentage of healthy ones (10 million cowstested in 2002).On Christmas Eve 2003, the sudden hysteria over the mad cow case caused Tysonmeat packing and McDonald's to lose over 5 percent of their stock value in asingle day. Supermarkets removed meat from their shelves.What Is Mad Cow?At the heart of the problem was a tiny protein known as a prion, a protein thatcan mutate and misfold into a lethal form, eating away at the brain, causingmadness, wasting, and death. Dr. Stanley Prusiner discovered this agent in 1988and won a Nobel Prize for his work. He proposed that this particle is also aninfectious agent. Because it is an impossible-to-stop monotonic killer thatstarts off as an innocent protein, it has frightened the public despite beingextremely rare.Animals that eat infected tissues can contract the disease, setting off anepidemic when vegetarian animals are forced byFALSE ALARMhumans to eat one another via rendered meats. But these mis-folded proteins canalso arise spontaneously in cattle and other animals, including man, where therare disease of progressive dementia and muscle jerks is known asCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or CJD.Scrapies is the version of the disease in sheep, causing severe wasting andmadness. Unfortunately, sheep brains were part of the meal fed to cows in Europein the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the disease became endemic in cows.Because of the lag time of several years between contamination and infection,cases can be missed. Not every animal that has died a progressive demented deathhas been properly diagnosed. This uncertainty is part of what scares us.But the risk of acquiring mad cow disease from the meat we eat has always beenvery low because of a built-in protection that the news media has failed toemphasize. The direct transmission from animal to human involves crossing aneffective species barrier. This means that though there were several thousandinfected animals in Europe in the 1980s and early 1990s, and though millions ofhumans ate beef, the number of people known to have acquired mad cow from eatingbeef (known as variant CJD) was very small. Even though the United Kingdom had39,000 newly infected cows per year at peak, and 180,000 cases during the worstten-year period, which was 90 percent of the world's total, only 140 people haveactually been infected with the variant CJD so far, and 120 have died.But the media focus on the mystery and deadliness of the disease has made itseem like a lot more deaths.From Cow to Human: Fear in EuropeIn the 1990s, the British government responded to the growing epidemic amongcows by banning the use of meat-and-bone meal, and the number of cattle with madcow disease decreased dramatically.COWS, BIRDS, AND HUMANSBut in 1996, health officials in Great Britain became alarmed by the discoveryof an apparent link between mad cow disease in animals and a new variant of CJDin humans. Whereas the spontaneous human form of prion disease primarilyaffected the elderly, the new variant (vCJD) affected people in their late teensand twenties. In August 1996, a British coroner ruled that a twenty-year-oldBritish vegetarian who died from variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease caught itfrom eating beefburgers as a child, starting the nationwide panic.VCJD is a rapidly progressive disease—its symptoms include emotional distress orconfusion, and, ultimately, dementia, loss of muscle control, and death within ayear.The primitive fear of catching a fatal disease from an animal coupled with thehorror of the disease itself helped fuel the panic. Once isolated cases beganoccurring, worried people lost sight of the fact that the risk of catching thedisease on a person-by-person basis was still almost nonexistent.In the mid-1990s, responding to the growing panic, the European Union bannedBritain from exporting beef. In Britain, some restaurants struck red meat fromtheir menus, and many consumers refused to buy cow-based food even for theirpets. The sale of any beef attached to the bone, which could contain prions, wasoutlawed in Europe for several years.Even though the number of human cases remained quite small, the Britishgovernment felt compelled to put in place a variety of safety measures: itordered 4.5 million cattle destroyed, banned animal-component feed orfertilizer, and instituted the tracking and testing program.These measures paid off handsomely at least in terms of cows. In 2003 there wereonly 148 confirmed cases in cows, well down from a peak of 36,680 in 1992, whenone out of every twenty cows in Great Britain had the disease. The preventativeand regulatory measures helped to revive the industry. The European Union banagainst British beef was dropped in mid-1999.FALSE ALARMHowever, a four-thousand-page report released in 2000 found that the Britishgovernment had initially misled the public for a decade by failing to emphasizethe possibility that the disease could be passed on to humans. Once a caseappeared, this lack of information and preparation became the focus, rather thanthe limited risk. The public mistrust that resulted helped sustain the panic. Ittook several years before the systematic inspection of animals and thedecreasing numbers of afflicted cows helped to relieve the public's fears.The British experience illustrated how true diligence can diminish the public'sfear response while misinformation enhances it. If you could trust your leadersto begin with, you would be much less likely to engage your fear apparatusunnecessarily.Mad Cow ProductsOn this side of the ocean, beginning in 1989 the USDA banned the importation ofcows, sheep, and goats and their products from Great Britain, and from all ofEurope beginning in 1997. But outrageously, the FDA did not have similar successin banning these products from vaccines, soaps, and gel caps. The FDA has alsohad difficulty enforcing cow feed regulations here at home.In January 2004, Newsday's Kathleen Kerr reported that \"in the last six yearsthe FDA has sent 63 warning letters to companies involved in the cattle industrydetailing unsafe practices— ranging from sloppy clean-up methods in feed millsto improper labeling.\"At the same time, fetal calf serum from the United Kingdom has been used in theproduction of vaccines, including the period in the mid-1980s when the incidenceof BSE in calves was as high as 1 in 2,000. Since the sera from approximately1,500 calves are pooled together, this makes it theoretically possible that if 1in 2,000 calves was infected, any given serum pool might be infected.The FDA has stressed that the risks of getting mad cow disease from a bovineproduct are remote and strictly theoretical. But theCOWS, BIRDS, AND HUMANSsame FDA has shown an inability to effectively restrict bovine products. The FDArepeatedly recommends that vaccine manufacturers stop using bovine materialsfrom BSE-affected countries, but no one is listening. Furthermore, capsules usedin countless medications have been made using gelatin ground from cowbones—including those from countries where mad cow disease was endemic.Time has shown that our fear of mad cow disease was overblown, which wasfortunate, given the ineptitude of the food-protecting agencies struggling tosave us from it.Feeling Safe: Beyond the Numerical RiskOn December 31, 2003, the New York Times reported that the USDA had issued new,tougher regulations. Animals tested for BSE would no longer be marked \"inspectedand passed\" until test results were confirmed. This pending meat would not enterthe food supply. Downer cows, which were sick or could not walk, would also bebanned. The creation of a nationwide animal tracking system was planned.On January 2, 2004, Eric Schlosser, the author of Fast Food Nation, wrote anop-ed in the New York Times pointing out that Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman,who responded to the mad cow crisis by \"reassuring the world that American beefis safe,\" was also former director of public relations for the NationalCattlemen's Beef Association and was therefore quite biased. \"For too long theemphasis has been on commerce, at the expense of safety,\" Schlosser wrote.Further, despite the new regulations, there was still no plan on the part of theUSDA to begin the kind of large-scale beef-screening program as was in place inEurope or Japan. Schlosser recommended the creation of a new agency that wouldlack the USD As agenda of promoting American meat worldwide. The new agencywould be a real food safety agency.But as mad cow faded from the public consciousness, the American public began toreturn to its habit of indiscriminate beef consumption.FALSE ALARMFear could be positive if it led to more careful scrutiny of our beef. Fear of asingle cow infecting us isn't justified, but attention to the overall safety ofour beef is.Mad cow disease was now rare in cows and practically nonexistent in humans, butbacteria like £. coli were more prevalent and potentially risky. Unfortunately,news media overcome by hysteria weren't about to scratch below the surface toconsider the real danger.Bird FluBy the end of January 2004, it was clear that the human flu had peaked andpetered out. Ironically, it turned out to be a mild flu season. The CDC reportedthat this year's mismatched vaccine had not succeeded in diminishing flusymptoms. The disease had simply run its yearly course. Increased attention toinfluenza, of a less frenzied type, could be helpful in the future, but themedia-induced hysteria and the rush to vaccinate had not been productive.We bounced from one bug du jour to the next, without perspective, without even amemory of how the past bug du jour had suddenly and unceremoniously been dumpedfrom the media spotlight, deflating all its supposed dangers.By January 24, 2004, we suddenly began hearing about the avian flu, the newpotential bug du jour. After practically ignoring human flu, this time the NewYork Times provided extensive front-page coverage, creating a sense of immediacyand sweeping importance: \"The announcement, made by the Thai government onFriday, has deepened fears of a global epidemic if the virus combines withanother that can be transmitted from person to person.\"The Thai government had supposedly suppressed the information about the sickchickens for weeks in order to protect its poultry industry, as China hadsuppressed information about patients sick with SARS the year before to protecttourism. Once uncovered, suppression stoked fears.The City of New York Department of Health and MentalCOWS, BIRDS, AND HUMANSHygiene suddenly issued a new advisory on January 28, alerting health careproviders to widespread outbreaks of avian influenza A in domestic poultry andwild birds in ten countries in Asia, where by the beginning of February avianflu had infected over twenty humans among bird handlers and their relatives,killing fourteen people. If you'd traveled to Asia recently and returned to NewYork with respiratory symptoms, you were being asked to report to the healthdepartment. But human-to-human transmission was extremely unlikely. The viruswas routinely killed when a chicken was cooked. If this public health alertexpanded, panic was sure to result.A New York Times editorial on Friday, January 30, acknowledged that \"the threatto Americans is virtually nonexistent,\" but went on to state that \"healthofficials are rushing to prepare a seed virus for vaccine production, butfull-scale production could take months.\" The problem with this sort of rhetoricwas that while professing calm, it simultaneously spread fear. People couldwrongly conclude from this that something terrible might be in the offing. Hypebreeds fear, unless a person is trained to assess risk independently.Not on Our ShoresDespite the fact that not a single infected bird had escaped the Asiancontinent, Lee Jong-Wook, WHO director general, had also helped to spreadchicken phobia on January 28 with the statement \"This is a serious global threatto human health.\" In fact, the bird flu was not such a threat, despite being aserious disease in birds. We would all worry less if we understood thedifference between potential and actual risk.As an American bug du jour, the avian flu would not have the same fear impact asthe others did as long as it didn't jump to humans and cross the ocean. But ifit infected even a single American, we might then wrongly conclude that itthreatened all of us here.FALSE ALARMMeanwhile, over in Asia, the.virus was creating havoc, bringing up memories ofSARS even if the victims this time around were birds, with few people. Over 100million chickens, crows, and ducks died across Asia, mostly fromgovernment-ordered slaughters rather than from the disease. It was difficult toknow whether this much bird carnage was necessary in order to prevent asignificant spread to humans, or whether it was a way of treating the fear. Buteven as a protective gesture it backfired, as vivid television and newspaperimages of unprotected people throwing dead chickens into pits or stuffing themlive into sacks was enough to spread further hysteria and begin to causeeconomic shutdown, as it did with SARS.Here in the United States, thousands of chickens were being killed in Delawarefor another unrelated bird flu. (Ironically, China was now banning our chickensjust as Japan was banning our beef.)The excessive killing of birds was public health posturing, a gesture meant toshow us that we were being protected. But obviously, no scientific study hadbeen done to determine how many chickens needed to be killed to preventsignificant spread of a bird flu, even among birds.Another key factor keeping Americans from full-blown bird panic in early 2004was that we weren't yet ready to consider another influenza. We weredesensitized to flu viruses for the time being. According to Dr. Sabban, anexpert in stress models, it would take a different kind of bug to make ushysterical again so soon.Avian flu didn't quite capture our negative imagination. Asian birds didn'tscare us here the way exotic cats did with SARS. Exotic cats were unfamiliar andmade us feel uneasy, whereas Asian birds looked just like our own birds.But in Asia, avian flu pushed the SARS fear button. The Wall Street Journalprovided a stirring front-page headline on January 28, 2004: \"Bird-flu OutbreakRevives Concerns Stirred by SARS.\"COWS, BIRDS, AND HUMANSThis article described the poor public health conditions that had been the samefor SARS: \"animals and people living in close and sometimes unsanitary quarters;poor regulation of livestock; and ill-equipped public health workers hamstrungby local governments so anxious to avoid panic and economic pain that theiractions border on a coverup.\"Dr. Julie Gerberding of the CDC was quoted in the article, saying \"This could bea very serious problem if the epidemic in Asia is not contained.\" Which epidemicwas that? Was she trying to inflame us with the double-digit human deaths? Orperhaps she meant to say the \"chicken epidemic?\"The Journal backed up its front-page story with another story headlined\"Scientists Rush to Create Vaccine for Bird Flu—Just in Case.\" What was all thisrushing about?The Journal article provided the apparent answer in a box insert, \"Some expertsworry the virus could morph into a human superflu, as in the pandemic of1918-1920.\" Here was scary 1918, invoked again. And the ultimate drama: \"We haveto think about the potential for a significant population die-off,\" said Dr.David Fedson, formerly of the vaccine maker Aventis. Was Dr. Fedson beingmercenary or was he just going overboard? He was referring, after all, to thehuman population.Bird to HumanIn a March 2004 article published in Science, the Spanish flu of 1918, which hadinfected close to a billion people around the world, killing 50 million, wasdetermined to have made the jump from birds to humans by a slight change of thestructure of the spikelike molecules known as hemagglutinins by which the virusattaches itself to body cells.The 1918 Spanish flu pandemic is taken very seriously by epidemiologists, sinceit killed more people than any other single outbreak of disease, surpassing eventhe Black Death of the Middle Ages. In fact, it is thought that the virus playeda role in endingFALSE ALARMWorld War I, as soldiers were too sick to fight, and more men on both sides diedof flu than were killed by weapons.But the 2004 bird flu had a different molecular structure than the 1918 bug, andthere was no direct evidence that it was about to mutate and pass from human tohuman. Bringing the old scourge to light to scare the public into some kind of\"vigilance,\" when there was nothing definite in the offing, was problematic.Yet this was what John Barry, the author of The Great Influenza: The Epic Storyof the Deadliest Plague in History , urged everyone to do in his op-ed in USAToday on February 10, 2004. \"A public information effort must be launched toconvince people of the threat and heighten cooperation. From the perspectives ofpublic health and national security, the bird flu in Asia already should havethe full attention of every government in the world. The risks are too great todo otherwise.\" Cooperation among scientists was one thing. But \"to convincepeople of the threat\" meant to alarm them unnecessarily.Unbelievably, it was the television rather than the print media that seemed tobe sending a more reasoned message, for the first time I could point to sinceSeptember 11, 2001. The cable news coverage of the bird flu didn't appear to beas extensive as what the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal provided. Aproducer at CNN told me that they didn't \"want to appear to be sensationalizingthe story.\"But I suspected the lack of TV coverage had more to do with flu fatigue and lackof focus on other countries than it did with a sense of public responsibility.If the American public was ending up with the right perspective for once, it wasfor the wrong reasons.The Worldwide LaboratoryBy this time, great scientists studying the worldwide laboratory were becomingtoo interested in the latest bug in the news. WithCOWS, BIRDS, AND HUMANSpublicized contagions, our public health experts easily set aside the rigor oftheir training and fell into a trap of hype. Public health had gotten tooentangled with the media, and infectious disease experts had begun automaticallyusing the media megaphone to broadcast their message.It is true that an avian flu, if it morphs into a human-to-human virus, cancause another worldwide epidemic like the one in 1918. But many viruses andbacteria have the potential to harm, and it is up to public health agencies todistinguish between potential and actual. Disease information is contextual—itis never an all-or-nothing situation as portrayed in the news.Regardless, the CDC continued its public demonstrations of vigilance. Led by Dr.Gerberding, it responded quickly with multiple press conferences to each newperceived threat. This did a disservice to standard killers like malaria andAIDS, which infected and killed millions each year but were largely ignored.Public health resources were unjustly transferred to the latest potential threatin the news.The WHO had zoomed to the fore, with its new director Lee Jong-Wook embarrassingthe Thais for keeping their sick birds under wraps. But where was the sameeffort on behalf of the real killers, malaria and dengue, AIDS andschistosomiasis? And what about malnutrition? More people have died of hungerthan of all these diseases combined. Public health attention to the latestpotential killer instead of the known killers is not only an \"epidemic\" ofmisinformation, it is also a form of politically expedient job justification.Public health experts continued to use words like \"vigilance\" and \"rush to avaccine\" when describing a needed reaction to the bird flu. These were the samewords they used for SARS, and before that smallpox, and before that West Nilevirus. These aren't informative words; they don't give us any special insightinto a health risk, and they don't help us to distinguish a potential risk froman ongoing risk. Beyond misdirecting us away from realFALSE ALARMhealth risks, public health sound bites also provide wrong information. Clearly,an epidemiological need to track an emerging disease before it gets out of handis not the same thing as saying the entire public is already at risk.Part of the problem is that lab scientists who have never been trained in publicspeaking are suddenly clipped and quoted in the newspapers or thrust onto thetelevision screens and asked to provide three-minute descriptions of somethingthey may have spent a lifetime studying. There is a pressure to make it soundimportant or exciting, and this pressure leads easily to distortion andoverstatement.So we stockpiled millions of doses of smallpox vaccine in preparation for anattack that didn't come, to protect us against a bug that hadn't made anyonesick here since 1949. When the moment of fear and worry is upon us, our publichealth experts make us worry more. Unfortunately, in the case of smallpox, thesevaccines were perishable, and since hardly anyone agreed to take them, thismeant that millions of dollars worth of prevention had to be thrown away.The criteria for publishing a paper in a top scientific journal are stiff.Researchers have to study the requisite number of patients to make sure thestudy is statistically significant. Often studies are double-blind, which meansone can't know who receives which treatment ahead of time. There is a need forcareful controls, and all data must be checked and rechecked. No self-respectingscientist would have it any other way. Why should the criteria be less stringentwhen scientists inform the public about these same health issues?The Sequel: Flu Vaccine 2004In August 2004, Dr. Gerberding of the CDC stated that \"the time to be complacentabout the flu is over.\"Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute for Allergy and InfectiousDiseases, said on CNN, \"There is really aCOWS, BIRDS, AND HUMANSfull-court press going on now to develop\" flu vaccines that protect against manystrains of the virus, including the current bird flu. Fauci, a world leader ininfectious diseases, spoke with his usual gravitas, which unfortunately gave theimpression that an outbreak was looming.Without evidence, and with minimal risk, the cycle of worry was restarting, andit was using as an unwitting mouthpiece one of our most dedicated scientists.The Golden ShotIn fall 2004, the year's first flu-related death came not from the disease, butfrom an elderly woman who fell while waiting in line for the vaccine. Thisunfortunate event added to the annals of illness, where panic has always killedfar more than the disease that caused it. With the announcement that 50 millioninfluenza vaccines from the manufacturer Chiron wouldn't be available in theUnited States because of possible contamination, the CDC was put in an instantquandary, its credibility once again damaged. From pushing the yearly fluvaccine accelerator pedal, urging everyone to get a shot, they suddenly had toslam on the brakes, their reassurances, of course, sounding hollow.\"Take a deep breath, this is not an emergency,\" Dr. Gerberding said, trying tochange her persona instantly from apocalyptic to therapeutic.The sudden panic of people with fear memory from last year's flu, primed for theshot but now with nowhere to go for it, was likely to cause a stampede ofshot-seekers. The CDC had created a new monster. The frantic healthy folks couldeasily beat out the elderly short-of-breath patients who really need the vaccineto protect them from serious illness. The CDC's attempts to referee this problemwere bound to be ineffective.The whole flu-shot fiasco was an example of inadequate preparation coupled withoverinflated expectation and a fear of going without. One of the main reasonsthat a shortage like this couldFALSE ALARMoccur is that drug manufacturers are not anxious to produce vaccines in thefirst place. Vaccines are costly. Without a patent to uphold high prices, theprofit margins for generic vaccines are narrow. Plus, proper sterilizationmethods are quite expensive and cut into the profit margin further. Thechicken-egg culture medium still being used to produce vaccines needs to bereplaced by the latest in genetic engineering, but the changeover involvesanother billion-dollar expense.Forget altruism, or concern for patients—they are simply not part of the drugcompany equation. Drug companies are not eager to make a product they can't makea lot of money on.The only workable solution to prevent the panic of a sudden shortage is for thegovernment to step in and support and subsidize the manufacture of this vaccine.The plan of buying back unused vaccines isn't sufficient. It is far moreimportant to ensure production of an adequate number of vaccines in the firstplace.Instead, Congress only approved half of the $100 million requested in 2003 todevelop better flu vaccines and improve the distribution system.The British did not end up with the same kind of shortage despite the Chironmanufacturing disaster on their soil, because they rely on a diversity ofmanufacturers, and the government purchases the entire supply itself, so thepublic needn't worry.In contrast, in late October 2004, U.S. health authorities began scrambling tomake up some of our lost doses from other countries' stockpiles. Canada had 2million doses of surplus vaccine to make available for U.S. use, according toDavid Butler-Jones, Canada's public health officer. But there was difficultylicensing them for use in the United States in time for the 2004 flu season.There were six manufacturers in the world who produced 200 million doses forother nations in 2004, while only two, Chiron and Aventis, were entirelyresponsible for our 100 million doses.In Germany, there is not the same urgent push for the flu vaccine. A studycarried out by Berlin's Robert Koch Institute inCOWS, BIRDS, AND HUMANSNovember 2003 showed that the average influenza vaccination rate in Germany isonly 23.7 percent. The numbers are somewhat higher for those over sixty, butGermans overall appear to be less fearful of the flu than we are here in theUnited States, despite the fact that a comparable percentage, five to eightthousand people, die of the flu in Germany every year. In 2004, Germany had 20million doses of the vaccine available for its use, and didn't report ashortage.The difference in flu fear between countries may be cultural. A ninety-year-oldwoman I know in northern Germany not only doesn't believe in flu shots, but shebelieves in an ice-cold shower in the morning and open windows in the bedroomswithout heat even in the winter. Yet, she is no more irrational than those whobelieve the flu shot is a panacea.In the United States, the rush for the 2004 shot was based on fear, not onmedical science. The well-publicized scarcity created a sudden sense of need.And by the time the smoke cleared in January of yet another mild flu season,there was an embarrassing surplus of shots that people no longer wanted. By thistime the attention of the news media was diverted to the deadly tsunami on theother side of the world, and no one was thinking about the flu except for thefew who had it.Bioterror Instead of FluInstead of preparing for the flu, our government has been busy spending billionsof dollars stockpiling millions of doses of anthrax vaccine (with no use for itin the foreseeable future), and over two hundred thousand doses of smallpoxvaccine (without a single case occurring here since 1949). These actions havebeen taken at least partly so that Homeland Security can look like it takes thethreat of biological agents seriously. A bioterror attack would likely onlyaffect hundreds or, worst-case, thousands at once, yet the expensivepreparations are for millions of potential victims.FALSE ALARMBioport makes the only current anthrax vaccine, an unwieldy six-dose processthat many military recruits have complained gives them a flulike syndrome. Butfearing an anthrax attack since 2001, the U.S. government has contracted withthis company for 75 million doses of the vaccine. Since the vaccine isperishable, and there is no anthrax here, most of what is produced is thrownaway. Similarly, panicked over smallpox in 2002 and 2003, the governmentpurchased 291,400 doses of the antiquated live virus vaccines, discarding 90percent of them due to fear of side effects and lack of need.Meanwhile, the CDC has determined that at least 185 million Americans couldbenefit from flu vaccine, either because they are at risk of getting very sickor are in close contact with those who are.Yet with the shortage in 2004, the available supply of flu vaccine that year wasonly about 54 million doses. The CDC was soon begging Aventis to produce more,but the company made available only 1 million additional doses. Was this all itcould make, or all it would make? No one I spoke to at the manufacturer was ableto provide an answer.Instead of the government spending all its vaccine money on the production ofnearly useless bioterror vaccines, a more substantial flu subsidy could lead tothe consistent availability of at least 100 million doses, which would calmnerves and perhaps even save lives.Who Gets the Shot?The waiting room of my office was filling with frantic healthy patients who hadcome in without appointments, all yearning for the coveted 2004 vaccine. Myphone was ringing incessantly with the same question. Does he have it yet? Itold most callers no, though I had scrounged and begged my usual supplier forfive vials, enough for fifty of my sickest patients. But I didn't tell anyonethis, trying to avoid a stampede.The flu vaccine is useful, but it is not the key to good health. Plenty ofpeople make it through the winter safely without it.COWS, BIRDS, AND HUMANSMost of my patients would do fine without a shot in 2004, but knowing that therewas a scarcity had clouded people's reason.I offered my elderly and chronically ill patients a vaccine against pneumonia,which I had in ample supply, but even when they took it, they hardly seemedreassured by my observation that it was often pneumonia that made flu patientsthe sickest. The lucky few who did get the flu shot didn't flinch from theneedle puncture, but sighed with an almost palpable relief as the protectiveserum surged into their muscle. For the others I stressed hand washing andisolating those with the flu, but driven by the news, frantic shot seekersignored this calmer perspective.In 2004 I was bound by public health authorities to give the vaccine I did haveto the very old, the very young, the very sick, pregnant women, and health careworkers. This was a good policy, because I had so little.Within this policy, I set my own sub-policy—to give it only to those who alreadyhad an appointment and the sickest who called in. Like many other doctors, I hadset aside office visits in the early fall to give these vaccinations, and I hadneither enough appointments left nor flu shots for the panicked many.I reassured those who weren't at great risk, and I saved some of my fifty shotsfor my office staff, my pregnant wife, and my elderly parents. For the firsttime in years I was compelled to ration supplies, which caused me to properlyconsider which patients were most susceptible to serious infection.I declined to charge higher rates for giving an older patient the shot. Anunethical doctor could make money in a hurry under these panicked circumstances,but he could also go to jail for Medicare fraud.One night, I made a rare house call, taking a vial to Long Island. One of mychronically ill patients was an old friend who was housebound with a bad leg,and I drove out to see him. He was relieved to see the syringe, the alcohol pad,and, especially, the vial. But afterward, as I was getting ready to leave, hestopped me.FALSE ALARM\"Can my wife have one too?\" .On cue, she was standing in the doorway, a woman in her early fifties, eager fora flu shot, but not qualifying for one.\"No,\" I said. \"I can lose my license for giving this out to the wrong people.Think of the people who are really at risk.\"She was ready to give up, but he wasn't. \"Can't you make an exception?\" hepleaded.The tension was so great that I actually dropped the precious vial. I thought Iheard it crack when it hit the floor, and I felt certain I had broken it. Theyboth peered at me anxiously as I bent to pick up the magic elixir and retrievedit as it was rolling away. Luckily, the contents were intact.\"Okay,\" I said nervously. \"Maybe she qualifies. You're at high risk, and she's aclose contact. I can give her a shot.\"They sighed, thanked me repeatedly, more than they had the last time he wastreated successfully for pneumonia.I felt good, like a medical Robin Hood.It was only afterward, driving home, that I thought of my dwindling supply andconsidered a fragile wheezy patient with an office appointment a few weeks hencewho wouldn't be able to get a shot because of the one I'd just given away.Part IIIHEALING FEAR13THE FEAR PROPHETSGod is with me, I shall not fear.—Adon Olom prayerFear of the unknown and fear of death are primary fears, and they lead manypeople to religion. There is comfort to be found in the notion of a greaterbeing who controls destiny. If a person makes peace with his or her god, then aninner serenity may be achieved.Religion has worked well for many who struggle with deep questions that have noready answers. If a patient suddenly receives a terminal diagnosis, her faithmay sustain her through the harrowing process of dying.Christianity and Judaism have taught that fearing God is the way to deal withthe ultimate fear of death. We needn't fear death, instead we should revere God.A central passage in Jewish teachings states, \"Raisheet chochmah yiratAdonoy—The beginning of wisdom is the awe of God\" (Psalms 111:10).In Christian theology, the principle of a loving God driving out the fear of theworld is discussed in 1 John: \"God is love . . . there is no fear in love. Butperfect love drives out [worldly] fear, because fearFALSE ALARMhas to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love\" (1John 4:16b-18).In the name of God throughout history, rather than preaching love and devotion,religious leaders have often used threats of retribution to get their followersto conform. (If you don't follow these rules, you may burn in hell.) Withoutdoubt, religions can invoke fear as well as dispel it, but in times of tragedyand nervousness, many still turn to religion for comfort.But religious leaders are not always equipped to handle day-today worries,superstitions, or unrealistic fears. In today's climate of fragmented andmisguided information, an anxious alienated public may invoke spiritualplatitudes that are difficult to apply to worldly concerns.Priests, ministers, and rabbis are religion's go-to people, but they are notsoothsayers. Nevertheless, the more nervous people become, worried out ofproportion to real risks, frightened of hyped dangers, the more people presenttheir clergy with questions that men of the cloth may not always be able toanswer. God's representatives may grow weary, overwhelmed by their congregants'earthly panic.A RabbiAbout a month after Ephraim Azziz's operative date to remove the tiny cancer atthe top of his lung, I received a phone call on Saturday evening, just afterdusk. He had decided to call me at the conclusion of the Sabbath. His voice wasstill a hoarse whisper, not immediately recognizable.\"Thank you, doctor,\" he whispered. \"You found it very early. Stage IA. Thesethings usually kill you by the time they're found. But no lymph nodes. Nospread. I'm clean. Some chemo and hopefully I'm done. Thank God.\"I recalled showing his CT scan to my office mate, Dr. Madison, and how thedisorganization at NYU before his needle biopsy had led him to have his surgeryat the Memorial Sloan-KetteringTHE FEAR PROPHETSCancer Center. I hadn't expected to hear from him again after that.\"It's a good thing you came in when you did,\" I said, \"and we decided not towait on the CT scan. How are you feeling?\" \"I'm weak. Very weak.\"Two weeks later Azziz was back in my office examination room, covered withperspiration, breathing shallowly, and appearing fatigued. His hair had turned anew shade of gray, and his familiar tiny glasses were now crooked and greased.But a quick physical showed me that his vital signs were stable, his lungs wereclear, and he had a normal temperature.Despite his discomfort, it was clear to me that the purpose of his visit was notstrictly medical—he was still under the direct care of the surgeon, but he wascoming to me for reassurance.He was in too much pain to sit straight on my blue office couch, so he half-sat,half-lounged.\"Let me tell you something, doctor,\" he said. \"You are a man of science, notmysticism.\" His heavily accented voice added intrigue to his statement.\"I hope I am open-minded,\" I said.\"You know I am observant, a regular congregant at my synagogue. Do you know ofthe Rachamim? The mystical rabbis?\" \"The Kabbalists,\" I said, and he smiled.\"Twelve years ago a Kabbalistic rabbi, as you call it, told me that I wassupposed to die, but that God was going to have compassion on me. I've alwaysremembered that. Now, you know it was two weeks before Rosh Hashanah, two weeksbefore I was to be inscribed in the book of life for the year, a week before youordered the fateful CT scan, and I had a big fight with my wife. We came homefrom synagogue and she was upset. She said we had no life except the shul. Weargued about it, and I went out again, but I had nowhere else to go, so Ireturned to the synagogue. It was the end of Shabbat, and I saw that there was amystical rabbi there, famous from Israel, and there was a long line of peoplewaiting to hear what he had to say. I stood at the end of theFALSE ALARMline, and by the time he got to me it was very dark outside. When he saw me, Icould tell that he was startled. He told me that he was going to give me a newname, Mordecai.\" \"Why a new name?\"Azziz smiled slowly. \"It is a tradition. It signifies a new life. Right away, hewas telling me that I required a new identity. Sometimes things don't go right,he said. He said that he would write me a blessing on parchment and mail it tome from Israel.\"\"What happened?\"\"When I got the results of the CT scan, I knew this was what he had meant. Mywife said it was superstition, that these rabbis were just fortune-tellers, butI didn't agree. I telephoned the rabbi in Israel. I asked if he remembered me,and he did. I asked him what he saw, why he gave me another name. Here's what hesaid: 'In reincarnation, sometimes you come into this world with a sentence,something hanging over you from a previous life. But God gives you the means toundo that sentence, a medicine to treat it with. Your life has been spared,' themystical rabbi told me. 'God will have compassion on you and there will be a newlife for you, and everything will be okay.'\"I told him then the results of the CT scan, and he didn't seem surprised. Hesaid again that I would be okay. The day of the operation, his letter arrived,with the parchment and the blessing.\"We doctors had contributed to Azziz's well-being by discovering his cancer, thenproviding information that brought perspective and the hope appropriate withcancer that was found early. A doctor had swiftly removed the cancer with hisscalpel and brought the chance for a cure.But in the end Azziz was most comforted by the notion that both his illness andhis recovery had been preordained, knowable only by the prescient powers of themystical rabbis. Giving over control to their vision had helped him to make thedifficult transition from apparent health to life-threatening illness in a shortperiod of time. He'd been nervous and fearful, but he'd managed to cope.THE FEAR PROPHETSEmbracing this fateful view allowed him to take some of the responsibility awayfrom cigarettes. But tobacco deserved no such pardon. The virile Marlboro Manimages of smoking that corporate advertising had put over on us for so manyyears had a lot more to do with Azziz's cancer than the inevitability of fate.Azziz was experiencing a fear that eclipsed even the usual fear of disease.Images of organ-wrenching cancer deaths have imbued it with a stigma that isdifficult to face without becoming fatalistic. Azziz's fear was out ofproportion to the risk of even cancer, because of the Internet and media hypeand misinformation that had conditioned him. Cancer info-bites petrify people.It was unfortunate that the only relief for Azziz was to be found in thereassuring words and miraculous vision of an all-knowing mystic. In a world ofsuch isolation, these were the only tools Azziz could find to help him regainhis purpose.Two PriestsTwo priests were patients in my practice for several years, though I didn'tconnect them in my mind. They both served as chaplains to the New York City FireDepartment, but they rarely met at FDNY functions, and not once in my officewaiting room. They were different kinds of men. Father Mychal Judge, aFranciscan friar who lacked a parish, was a public figure who provided succor tofirefighters as well as to everyone from the homeless to the famous. He servedon soup lines and was also a regular guest at both Gracie Mansion and theClinton White House.A visit to my medical office from Judge meant a waiting room confessionalinvolving Judge and several of my patients. Getting him to confide in me wasn'tas easy. He accepted the samples of blood pressure medications I gave him, buthe didn't seem concerned for his health, only for the health of others. Judgesaid he was not afraid of getting sick or of dying.Father \"John Henderson,\" on the other hand, was a private man. He too had highblood pressure and accepted samples, butFALSE ALARMbeyond this, the similarity to Judge seemed to end. Henderson had his own parishin the heart of working man's Brooklyn; he was usually to be found in his studyreading, or in the rectory, or meeting with his congregants. He was involvedwith the fire department only when they called him, sometimes when Judge was outof town visiting various dignitaries, including the Clintons.Judge was not a favorite of Cardinal O'Connor, because Judge frequently upstagedhim—and there was the time when a bereaved widow insisted that Friar Judgerather than the cardinal perform the funeral services for her husband at St.Patrick's Cathedral.When Judge required sudden surgery for abdominal pain, he didn't show fear orworry, even after the surgeon took out a perfectly normal gall bladder and leftin a festering part of the colon. Judge went through the second surgery withoutplacing blame. He said he would ask God to forgive the surgeon's mistake. Judgewas a clear example of how a person could stay centered, not allowing hisperspective to be altered by panic.I was hoping that the day would come when I could reassure Father Judge the wayhe did others, but he didn't require it from me. When his insurance lapsed, hedidn't come to my office for many months, not wanting to accept my charity. Whenhe died suddenly in the World Trade Center rescue operations on 9/11, it waswith courage rather than fear.Surely Judge, if he had lived, would have remained a go-to person in ourhysteria-ridden times. While he was alive, he was a sponge for others' fear aswell as a role model for courage.The Fear CounselorAfter Father Judge died, Father Henderson became very busy. He was compelled toignore his own parish, taking Judge's prominent place amid complaints that thisunassuming padre was no Father Judge. Henderson was the first to admit it.But he had his own style, and he worked tirelessly through the evenings and lateinto the night calming the shocked and bereavedTHE FEAR PROPHETSsurvivors of 9/11, the families, and the firefighters. He officiated at many ofthe funerals, but because of his halting speech, it was lost on many whoattended just how eloquent his sermons were.Henderson lacked Judge's flamboyance, but not his purpose, and his faith salvedmany psychic wounds. He helped people who were frightened to retain control oftheir lives by continuing to work and care for their families. He encouragedpeople to stay within their usual patterns of living.I think that Henderson expected the complaints to slow down, as peoplereadjusted to the post-9/11 world. Instead, with a continued high volume ofcalls he began to grow more and more uneasy. He no longer slept well at night,and he frequently forgot to shave. He also began to question the nature of thecomplaints. People were worried about another attack, they were worried abouttoxins in the air, they were worried about every bug du jour, and they wereworried about their children's future. All this was understandable, butHenderson recognized that his role was transforming into that of a therapist.People were consulting him and needing to speak to him about worries that hadlittle to do with his being a priest.One night in April 2003, he returned home to his empty silent room at the churchrectory at 2 a.m., and as he lay in his bed sleeplessly thinking, an old regretpained him—he didn't have a family. His life was becoming a collection of thefrets and fears of his congregants.The next day, Henderson appeared in my office in the late afternoon without anappointment, just before my staff was about to leave for the day. Seeing one ofher favorite patients arrive bundled in an overcoat that was too heavy for themild spring weather, my office nurse quickly ushered him into one of theexamining rooms.Henderson didn't speak. His blood pressure was normal and his physical exam andEKG unremarkable. I told him to dress, and he followed me to my pale blue brickconsultation room. Sitting on the couch across from me, he stared out the windowtoward the Empire State Building.FALSE ALARM\"What's the matter, John?\" I asked. \"Why are you here?\" When he looked at me, hebegan wringing his hands until they reddened.\"I haven't been sleeping,\" he said slowly. \"Why not?\"\"I'm out all evening. The whole city is in a panic. They're geared up forsomething, but they don't know what it is or when it's going to come. They can'tseem to calm down.\"I wasn't sure whether he was referring to a specific scare. SARS was justbecoming \"newsworthy\" at the time of this office visit but wasn't yet in fullswing.\"Who is afraid?\"\"It's everyone. Not just the orphans and widows, not just the firefighters ortheir families. People stop me on the street: 'Father, can you help me?''Father, can I please talk to you?'\"\"What do you tell them?\"He smiled. We had known each other for many years, and he was comfortable withmy bluntness.\"Come on, Doc. You know what I tell them. I tell them to have faith. I tell themthat everything is beyond their control, that they have to give their worriesover to a merciful creator.\"\"Does this help them?\"\"It helps them. But does it help me?! I absorb this, and then I can't sleep atnight. I have my faith but it's not always enough. And what are they worriedabout? They worry about bombs and threats that haven't happened and may neverhappen. My parishioners, the firefighters, their families, their doubtsoverwhelm me. What am I supposed to do?\"This was more than he had said to me in all the years I'd known him. I'd metFather Henderson in 1993 following the stroke of his brother, Thomas, anaccomplished botanist. I'd cared for Thomas through a blood clot in his leg, twobouts of pneumonia, and ultimately, the pancreatic cancer in 1999 that took hislife. John brought his brother in his wheelchair to most of his doctors' visits.THE FEAR PROPHETSAt home, he injected him with morphine to control the pain. In the end, hehelped his brother accept his death.Even in the period of grief following this, John didn't appear as somber as hedid now.\"Are you depressed?\" I asked.He thought about it. \"No.\"\"Anxious, overwhelmed?\"\"That's more like it.\"\"I can give you a mild tranquilizer at night called Klonopin that will help youbreak the cycle. You might be a little sleepy from it in the morning, but a cupof coffee will counter that.\"He nodded that he would take the prescription.\"Father, do you know what you're afraid of?\"Henderson smiled.\"I'm not afraid of dying. Every day I pray for acceptance of my fate. But mostwho turn to me for help are afraid of dying. I think that's where theirvulnerability comes from. People are in a panic every day now, they feel out ofcontrol. Their specific fears may be made up by the politicians or the TV, butit feels real to them. And I think I am absorbing this worry. I absorb it byosmosis, and it becomes difficult for me to control.\"\"What do you do?\"He sighed. \"Back when I was a kid and something would frighten me, I remembercoming home alone at night and seeing my father sitting in the warm kitchen,reading his paper and drinking his tea the way he did every night to relax. Hewould just wink at me, and I would be reassured. The apprehension would be gone,knowing he was the last stop for me.\"\"What do you do now?\"\"I came here to see you today.\"Father Henderson stood up then, and we shook hands. \"Thanks, Doc,\" he said.\"I want to see you again in two weeks,\" I said. \"And don't reschedule.\"FALSE ALARMJohn wouldn't go for psychotherapy, but he continued to come to see me in thismanner, over several weeks. He rarely needed to take the Klonopin, and afterfive visits, he said he felt better.I was flattered, realizing that the earthly comfort John was seeking was simplyto know that he could confide in someone. In my office, where the staff treatedhim warmly, he could be diverted from the chaos of war anxiety. He had absorbedthe irrational fears until he was radioactive with them.Father Henderson and his enduring faith had always provided a haven for othersfrom fear. His parish was for many their only consolation. When he wasoverwhelmed, however, my office was his haven, like the kitchen of hischildhood. I served as a reminder of the comfort his father had provided onthose days when a son came home frightened on a dark night.The Fear ProphetOf all the speakers at the fear conference at the New School in February 2004,Tom Pyszczynski, the originator of terror management theory, was the mostunassuming, the most soft-spoken, and yet his central idea stayed with me mostvividly. His long white hair flowing to his shoulders like a postmodernwizard's, he spoke about all fear emanating from a central fear of death.If this is true for animals, it is truer for humans, who, like our animalpredecessors, can be instinctively petrified of death and, in addition, bepetrified by the contemplation of death. Pyszczynski, a psychologist, saw thebasic human need to sublimate this central fear in culture and society. But whenthe society we build for ourselves begins to deteriorate, as this one has, it nolonger absorbs our fears. Our safety net of information and communicated risk issuspect. We are frightened for our lives beyond any realistic danger by thosewe've appointed as our protectors.For many, faith is the only consolation. Faith takes the worry away andtransfers it to a higher Being who is controlling theTHE FEAR PROPHETSworld. Any sense of control we have is illusory. And yet, we obsess on controland fear its loss.These days our culture of worry is a growing weed that feeds on manufactureddangers and threatens to become its own cult. Traditional religion may not be amatch for it. Religion works best when it engages the unanswerable questions,where faith is paramount in coping with the uncertainty of death. But religionhas become overloaded with today's obsessive worry and no longer serves as areliable cure for fear.IS THERE A CURE FOR FEAR?I liberated myself from the fear by creating these works. Their creation had thepurpose of healing myself.—Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama in an interviewNor should we forget that courage is contagious, that it overcomes the silenceand fear that estrange people from one another.—Paul Rogat Loeb, The Impossible Will Take a Little While: A Citizen's Guide toHope in a Time of FearIf fear is no longer protective, if it has been transformed from an adaptivetool into a symptomatic illness, then we have to find a way to cure it.The spread of fear has reached epidemic proportions. The national mediabroadcast threats and warp our perspective. The sense of immediate danger ishighly contagious.To slow the spread of fear, it is necessary to \"vaccinate\" with194IS THERE A CURE FOR FEAR?reason those who aren't yet afflicted. A population that is slow to reacthysterically helps contain fear. But lasting immunity to the epidemic of fear isdifficult to attain. The biochemistry is built into our brains, waiting to betriggered.Once fear has been elicited, it is stored deep in the emotional memory, ready toemerge whenever the so-called danger recurs.In early 2004, months before she broke her leg, my daughter, Rebecca, was takinga bath. She was almost three years old, the time when the brain circuitrycompletes its wiring of the \"safety center\" in the prefrontal cortex. She hadnever before experienced the bubble effect, and when the Jacuzzi device in thetub turned on automatically, I was on the other side of the apartment. By thetime I rushed back to the tub, she was petrified, standing straight up, brightred from crying.For months afterward, she was afraid to take a bath at all. I tried to appeal toher newly working brain center to suppress the fear that this tub would alwaysbring the scary bubbles, but the fear response was too strong.This is the reality that we encounter in America in the twenty-first century.Once alerted, once afraid, it is hard to turn the switch back to the offposition. The news signals danger, and we instantly fear it. A person living ina small town in the heartland who watches cable news may experience the fearalmost as much as a big-city dweller who has an infinitely greater risk ofwitnessing terrorism up close. An absurd confirmation of this manufactured TVfear comes when Homeland Security allocates funds to protect people againstterrorism at a rate of 25 dollars per person in New York, and just over 60dollars per person in Wyoming (in 2004).Of course, one simple cure is to turn off the TV.A New EquationThere is no standard treatment for fear in part because the symptoms vary fromone person to the next. A person may feel destined to a certain bad outcome andhave a greater sense of forebodingFALSE ALARMbecause of a certain family tendency. Some people more easily trigger afight-or-flight flood of \"hormones than others.My wife's mother has a severe case of multiple sclerosis and has been confinedto a wheelchair for almost twenty years. Six years ago, my wife's brotherdeveloped a mild case of MS, and my wife then confided in me her fear,practically a conviction, that she would be next. Every time she brings up herperception that MS is her destiny, I try to counter it with the bald statisticthat only 4 percent of first-degree relatives are at risk for the disease.\"There is a 96 percent chance that you won't get it,\" I say, but for my wife, asfor many others, the perception rests with the 4 percent. Empathy for her motherand a natural tendency to personalize her experience create the fear and theconviction.Recurrent or unremitting fear has the same effect on the human body that runningan engine persistently at 80 to 100 mph has on a car. For a person who is alwayson the alert, who suffers from a too easily triggered and sustainedfight-or-flight response, the result is a burned-out body. Many illnesses aremore likely to occur as a result, including heart disease, cancer, stroke, anddepression. What we have most to fear are not the exotic diseases that scare us,but the ordinary killers such as heart attacks that develop as a result of ourunremitting worries.We are scaring ourselves about the wrong things in a way that is clearly aterrorist's delight. (We do much of their work for them.) In 2001, terroristskilled 2,978 people in the United States, including the 5 from anthrax, and wehave been obsessed with terrorism and the supposed risks ever since.Meanwhile, according to the CDC, in 2001 heart disease killed 700,142 here;cancer 553,768; accidents 101,537; and suicide 30,622. Murders (not including9/11) accounted for 17,330 deaths that year. The number of children who died intheir infancy in 2001 was 27,801, and their deaths were no less horrible orfrightening for those involved than the attack on the World Trade Center.Of course the societal impact of 9/11 was unmatched.IS THERE A CURE FOR FEAR?We need to be reeducated as a prerequisite to healing fear. We tend tooverpersonalize much of the information we receive. We need a new sense ofproportion to correct this.The Fear VaccineHow calm can a patient be these days?Can we be reeducated not to trigger our fear, or will there instead be a simplepill that cures us all, or a fear vaccine? Oh, how we love our miracle cures.In a study by Jonathan Kipnis et al. in Israel published in the Proceedings ofthe National Academy of Sciences in May 2004, the authors gave an immunologicalvaccine to mice in whom they had previously induced psychosis. This chemicalcocktail bolstered the nerve cells, and the state of panic and paranoia ended.The mice were once again able to perform their usual tasks.The implication of these results is that immunological \"vaccines\" could have arole in reversing fear. If this supposition proves to be true, instead oflearning healthier contexts, we will be able to obscure our hysteria withimmunology.Fear vaccines raise similar ethical issues as medicating an entire society withbeta blockers or other antianxiety treatments. As our fear grows, the reach forsoothing salves is typical of American consumerism. It is one thing to employsophisticated technologies to heal the sick, to control psychosis, or to bolstera nerve fiber in a troubled brain. It is another to bottle the latestpreventative and market it widely to treat all fear.A Chemical CureAs I discussed in chapter 2, Joe Ledoux has determined that fear memory in ratsis deeply rooted and predominates over other types of rational memory. Ledouxshowed that when rats are given the medicine anisomycin, their fear memory isblocked. BasedFALSE ALARMon these results, Roger Pitman,.a professor of psychiatry at Harvard, theorizedthat administering the beta-blocker drug propranolol can also block fear memoryand blunt the fight-or-flight response.In 2002, Pitman and his group looked at the effects of giving propranolol withinsix hours of a traumatic event (mostly car accidents). One month afterward, hewas able to determine a significantly lower incidence of posttraumatic stressdisorder than in the control group. Larry Cahill, at the Irvine, California,memory center, also tested the effects of propranolol on humans and found thatit prevented people from recalling a gory story better than a bland story.But blunting fear memory with medication is not the same thing as retraining thebrain. It seems fruitless to provoke fear unnecessarily and then have to developdrugs to reverse it.Or as the President's Council on Bioethics wrote in the 2003 book BeyondTherapy, \"Use of memory-blunters at the time of traumatic events could interferewith the normal psychic work . . . there is a danger that our newpharmacological remedies will keep us 'bright' or impassive in the face ofthings that ought to trouble, sadden, outrage, or inspire us—that our medicatedsouls will stay flat no matter what happens to us or around us.\"Descartes argued in The Passions of the Soul that \"all the harm they [thepassions] can cause consists in their fortifying and conserving those thoughtsmore than is needed, or in fortifying and conserving others which ought not tobe fixed there.\" Descartes was referring to the damaging effects of negativeemotions. He felt we could become obsessed with our own dark thoughts. Almostfour hundred years later, we as a society may be even more susceptible to thesefears.I described the work of Rachel Yehuda earlier in this book. Dr. Yehuda hasconcluded that PTSD is too much in vogue in a way that harms us. Many people whosimply read or hear about a trauma think they are suffering from it. Unnecessaryanguish is often an overreaction to another person's trauma. We stimulateIS THERE A CURE FOR FEAR?our voyeuristic suffering and then find we may have to medicate ourselves tocoo) down.Our fear-for-profit culture is too ready to latch on to the next drug toregulate us. Imagine the drug company ears pricking up to this new role for betablockers. The new drug company TV ad is sure to be, \"Are you stressed? Do youexperience posttraumatic stress? Try this ...\"Pills become our crutches. Drug ads and our popular culture teach us to treatour cholesterol with pills rather than diet; our obesity responds toamphetamines rather than exercise; we clog our coronary arteries thoughtlesslyand then \"Roto-Rooter\" them open. We come to depend on these treatments. We areafraid to do without them.This medication dependency is not that dissimilar to many of our other productdependencies. We deplete the world's oil reserves built from millions of yearsof organic decay, and pollute the skies with our engines. All because we areafraid of the dark, or the cold, or the heat. We lead temperature-controlled,environment-controlled lives. We are afraid of aging, so we plastic-surgerizeour bodies to the best approximation of youth that we can obtain.All this environmental control stems back to our ultimate fear of death. We hidebehind the illusion provided by technology, but ultimately, fear of death seepsthrough. True culture, art, philosophy, and science provide better depositoriesfor human angst. Religious faith can help us to cope with our fear of death, butit can also be misappropriated by superstitious fears, as demonstrated in thelast chapter.In twenty-first-century America, we worship the god of wealth. We medicateourselves with the emotional anesthesia of materialism, but our fears seep inand overtake us anyway.The Politics of UnhealingI attended Medical Grand Rounds at New York University in March 2004 given byDr. Julie Gerberding of the CDC. She spokeFALSE ALARMin a soft voice and appeared surprisingly nervous. Her cropped hair was the sameheavily hair-sprayed salt-and-pepper bonnet that comes across on the TV screen.In person her face seemed rounder, though she continued to speak in the samepointed sound bites.I watched her from the back of the auditorium. She said she was glad to be backamong white-coat clinicians, since this had been her own background beforejoining the CDC. It was clear to me that she saw herself as a kind of healer inthe public realm. The CDC was, after all, an agency intended to protect thepublic from health care dangers.Gerberding, rather than present herself strictly as a scientist, tried to actthe part of the head of a consumer-friendly group, a go-to person for publicconcerns. \"As scientists deal with data, the public deals with values. Our roleis to translate information into relevant knowledge that helps people makechoices.\" She seemed sincere. Her soft voice and mild gestures helped toemphasize her apparent concern.But Dr. Gerberding failed to consider that if the public was being hyped into apseudoconcern by the media, then the CDC's concentrated involvement and publicdeclarations also sent the wrong message. She said, \"Like with bird flu, we knowthere is a serious threat of it jumping to humans. But do we need to worry aboutit on a day to day basis? It's our job to worry. We will worry for you.\"Gerberding was not one to downplay sufficiently. Her public display of worryingalways made us worry more. In fact, she was now associated with these diseasesshe'd helped to hype—SARS, smallpox, West Nile, and anthrax. \"We were in a SARSmode,\" she said excitedly. \"The public health system was able to step up to theplate. The CDC was protecting people in a transforming world.\"This self-aggrandizing statement hadn't been proven. Had the CDC done more tocontain the disease, or more to extend the hype? How could the public trust Dr.Gerberding unless she was able to give us a true perspective on diseases,differentiating between those that kill and those with only the potential to doso?The same week that Gerberding was speaking at NYU, \"Plan toIS THERE A CURE FOR FEAR?Battle AIDS Worldwide Is Falling Short\" was a headline on the front page of theNew York Times. An unstated factor in the public health reality was the constantreshuffling of priorities away from AIDS and toward the bug du jour. The articlestated that \"three years after the United Nations declared a worldwide offensiveagainst AIDS and 14 months after President Bush promised $15 billion for AIDStreatment in poor countries, shortages of money and battles over patents havekept antiretroviral drugs from reaching more than 90 percent of the poor peoplewho need them.\"AIDS is a massive worldwide killer, but we just aren't as afraid of it here inthe United States as we should be. The media, informed by the CDC, the WHO, andother experts, stoke our latest bug du jour fear fires to the detriment of theworldwide AIDS epidemic.The CDC is not supposed to be a public relations firm for the government. It isa group of scientists, and when they talk too much about a trumped-up danger ithas the effect of validating it. Preventing fear means developing a strategythat emphasizes that you aren't going to get a disease just because someone elsea thousand miles away from you has gotten it. Preventing fear means learningthat if there are holes in the so-called safety net, it matters only if thethreat itself is real.Instead, we are too often warned about things that don't threaten us, while atthe same time, ho-hum killers that can really get us— the overuse of Tylenol andAdvil, for example—are being ignored in our medicine cabinets.Treating fear means gaining a real perspective on danger, redirecting ourattention to those diseases that really can kill us, and developing awell-reasoned response to these real threats.TerrorismDr. Pachter, my neighbor and the director of the trauma service at NYU/Bellevue,still does not believe that proper medical preparations are in place againstterrorism. I met him in the hallway between our apartments one evening in lateMarch 2004.FALSE ALARM\"Are we prepared?\" I asked. . \"Nope,\" he said. \"Who is in charge?\" \"No one,\" hesaid.Dr. Pachter speaks sparely, and is known around the hospital as a gruff surgeonwho is also a skilled craftsman. But I know him as a kind and deeply spiritualman. His eyes express his feelings even when he doesn't say anything. Oneafternoon he invited me into his apartment and without ceremony handed me abeautiful gift for my son Joshua.Dr. Pachter has been involved in trying to integrate our hospitals into anemergency response plan for a terrorist attack.\"All we talk about is terrorism,\" I said to him that evening in March. \"Everyoneworries and exaggerates it. Maybe if we were prepared, we'd feel calmer.\"\"None of the hospitals speak to each other. There is no system in place in termsof who would do what, where the patients would go. Nothing has changed sinceSeptember 11. At that time we had an array of stretchers lined up at ChelseaPiers downtown, but not a single respirator, and only one intubation kit. Abunch of volunteers standing around, not knowing what to do.\"\"Isn't it more organized now? Isn't there a strategy?\"\"More equipment, maybe. A strategy? No.\"Meetings took place, and the newspapers reported on them. But for a practicalman like Pachter, whose presence made me feel secure in our own little apartmentenclave, there was not a satisfactory medical safety net in place for New YorkCity in 2004. If a limited attack actually happened and we didn't respondeffectively, fear would become rampant.On April 4, 2004, a New York Times front-page article lent further credence toPachter's position, detailing the disagreements between the police, fire, andoffice of emergency management departments in New York City over who was reallyin charge. \"The city still lacks what many experts say is the most basic andessential tool for handling disasters: a formal agreement governingIS THERE A CURE FOR FEAR?what city agency will lead the response at the scene of any catastrophicaccident or terrorist strike.\"Less focus on the unlikely, less exaggeration of potential impact, but morebehind-the-scenes cooperation, would create a climate where, if something didhappen, we might not overreact to it as easily.Healing HypochondriacsLiving in a climate of fear, we are becoming a society of hypochondriacs. Manypeople worry excessively over the slightest symptom, often convinced that theyare sick. As Mary Duenwald wrote in the New York Times in March 2004, \"They makefrequent doctors' appointments, demand unnecessary tests and can drive theirfriends and relatives—not to mention their physicians—to distraction with aseemingly endless search for reassurance.\"According to the American Psychiatric Association, a hypochondriac is a patientwho fears that he has a serious disease for at least six months despite doctors'attempts to reassure him that he is healthy. This definition is beginning toapply to more and more of us.The ancient Greeks coined the term hypochondria to refer to melancholy symptomsthat they associated with certain organs in men beneath the rib cage. In women,symptoms of \"hysteria\" were related to problems with the womb. It wasn't untilthe seventeenth century that physicians began to realize that these fearsoriginated in the brain.At the end of the twentieth century, when Ledoux and others began to map ourfear circuitry, they uncovered the neural network of fear that involves thebody's organs as well as the brain. So the Greeks weren't completely wrong intheir beliefs.Can the process that leads to hypochondria be reversed? Dr. Arthur Barsky ofHarvard published a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association inMarch 2004 looking at the effect of teaching hypochondriacs to pay lessattention to their symptoms. The results were analyzed at six-month and one-yearintervals.FALSE ALARMPatients were taught to suspend.their usual ways of responding to their fears,which included searching the Internet, taking their own vital signs, andscheduling excessive doctors' appointments. Doctors were coached to see theirpatients only for regular appointments and not to schedule tests as a knee-jerkresponse.In this JAMA study, Barsky observed that patients receiving this therapy \"hadsignificantly lower levels of hypochondriacal symptoms, beliefs, and attitudes ... and health-related anxiety. They also had significantly less impairment of...activities of daily living.\"In my medical practice, I have observed that many patients who aren't thefull-blown hypochondriacs of Barsky's study share a fear of death that oftenoverwhelms their ability to reason. I have found that many of these patients dobetter when they keep a sense of control rather than have strict limits imposedon them. Over time, these limits may not decrease fear as Barsky's studysuggests. I have found that giving over this control to a physician iscomforting only when a patient feels that this is her choice. Many patients whoinsist on reviewing their blood test results become even more apprehensive if adoctor tries to withhold these results. Deconditioning may be somewhat helpful,but primitive emotions like fear will find new outlets unless dealt with on adeeper level.Recently, I had a visit from my patient \"Zeke,\" whose father had died from anabdominal aneurysm. All of Zeke's siblings were suddenly worried that they toohad aneurysms. I reassured Zeke that it didn't tend to run in families, whichhelped some. I listened to Zeke's abdomen and found no noisy bruits tocorrespond to an aneurysm, which reassured him further. Ultimately it took anabdominal ultrasound to completely reassure him that he didn't have an aneurysm,a test that Barsky might have considered excessive, but it did the trick. ThoughZeke wasn't a textbook hypochondriac, his fears were extended by grieving in away that required extra reassurance.Hypochondriacs are people with an excessive fear of death trans-IS THERE A CURE FOR FEAR?lated into a multitude of neuroses about life. We all have these fears, but forsome they are more overwhelming than for others. And illness isn't the onlydirect metaphor for death. Legal hypochondriacs are those of us who are alwayscalling our lawyers and worrying about the possibility of suing or being sued—Iam one of those people for whom a lawsuit represents death. Luckily, my lawyeris a close friend and doesn't charge for my calls.My wife is a financial hypochondriac, which means that she worries thateverything will cost more money that we have. For her, bankruptcy means death.Our accountant handles my wife's concerns but then sends us large bills for theservice, which worries her further.Mostly, we are becoming a society of hypochondriacs, not just for medicalreasons, but because of preoccupations in all aspects of our lives. We buildelaborate safety nets for the wrong things, and then we panic when these netsare found to be ineffective.Healing this rampant fear means all of us becoming our own filters forinformation, not simply parroting what we hear on TV. We need to bedeconditioned, decontaminated, and decompressed from the high-pressuremisinformation that is being shot into our brains. Once purged, once healed ofour programmed fears, and with the help of knowledgeable go-to people who reallycare about us, we can reappraise the safety of our lives.Antidotes for FearMacbeth: Canst thou not minister to a mind diseas'd,Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,Raze out the rooted troubles of the brain,And with some sweet oblivious antidote,Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuffWhich weighs upon the heart? Doctor: Therein the patientMust minister to himself.FALSE ALARMFor years, I have tried to help people handle their disease fears withoutknowing if I am succeeding or not. In studying the fear circuitry of the brain,I have now come to appreciate that teaching might not automatically lead tolearning. Fear is a deep-rooted emotion, difficult for the brain to control.Sometimes its triggering can't be avoided. My daughter's experience with thebubbles as well as with her broken leg educated me that if fear is unlearned, itis because a new emotion replaces it. This healing occurs at its own rate ofspeed and a parent, or a doctor, has little control over it.Fear is an important factor in illness that hasn't been well accounted for.Physical, as well as psychological, breakdown occurs at an accelerated rateunder the pressure of persistent fear. Science now has the brain-mapping andchemical-testing prowess to help determine exactly how this happens.Unfortunately, we still have a long way to go before we stop unnecessarilytriggering the fear circuit in the first place.Once triggered, fear is personal and too often intractable. People may fearanyone or anything they perceive as alien, from terrorism to atheism to crime todisease to noise. But all of this fear of the \"other\" ultimately stems from afear of obliteration or death.To conquer fear we must return it to its primitive place as an instinct. We muststop overpersonalizing it. We must regain our footing with regular sleep,regular meals, regular entertainment, regular exercise, and regular work. Wemust resist those who choose the wrong danger, hype the need to respond, andthen bungle the response—making the threat seem even more real. We must replaceour unreal fears with real courage.Curing a Midlife CrisisOne patient revealed to me how fear could be healed.\"Joel Enrand\" was suffering from depression, weight gain, high cholesterol, andelevated blood pressure. Many studies in the medical literature predicted theseconditions would get worse if left untreated.IS THERE A CURE FOR FEAR?Mr. Enrand was a police detective and had endured the stress of many undercoverinvestigations. He had just turned forty, and he planned to retire from thepolice force in five more years with a good pension. In the meantime, he wasfinding his job more and more difficult to perform. He had been married foralmost twenty years and his son was a young teenager.His mental deterioration may have been gradual, but it was during an officevisit in midsummer that I noticed the change. Formerly aclap-you-on-the-shoulder type, on this visit he was timid, speaking too softlyto be understood. His curly hair had become an untrimmed shrub, and the officescale recorded a thirty-pound weight gain on his muscular frame. I noticed thathis rough-skinned face and neck had reddened, which may have been from thedirect effect of stress hormones.\"I can't sleep,\" he said.\"Why not?\"\"Things aren't so good with my wife.\"He described a home situation that had devolved into screaming fights in frontof his son. She yelled at him for coming home late. He yelled at her foryelling. She accused him of being with other women. He denied it. My instinctwas to believe him.I suggested that he see a therapist for the anxiety. He refused, saying hewasn't crazy.I offered to treat his anxiety with Valium and Prozac. For his rising bloodpressure I had in mind Lisinopril, a pill that dilates arteries, and for hishigh cholesterol I offered the ever-popular Lipitor (my patient looked nothinglike the smiling healthy people advertising cholesterol drugs on TV). Once hisblood pressure was under control, I could add an amphetamine for his obesity,and if his blood pressure rose as a result, I would increase the blood pressuremedicine to compensate.He showed little interest in these suggestions.I was hoping that he would at least look to me to help him through this periodof stress. Instead, he stopped coming to his appointments altogether, and when Icalled him on the phone, itFALSE ALARMwas apparent that though he was suffering miserably, he wasn't about to listento me.I finally managed to convince him to see me one more time, and knowing thismight be his final visit, I knew I had to rethink my approach. Trying to forcehim onto medications only underlined his deterioration, offered him a crutch,and made him identify himself as sick. Perhaps he felt that if he admitted tothis weakness, he might break down altogether.During our next meeting, Enrand admitted that he had an overriding fear oflosing everything—his health, his job, his family. Most of all, with paralyzingmiddle-of-the-night bouts of sleepless fright, he was afraid he was losing hismind.\"You're not crazy,\" I said, and on hearing this, the tiny muscles around hiseyes relaxed.I realized then that fear was his illness, not the high blood pressure, obesity,or cholesterol that developed as a result. Perhaps his apprehension woulddiminish if he was able to continue his life and not lose what he feared losing.I watched him, offering nothing. I had no choice now but to allow him to remainin control, as bit by bit he reinstituted his disciplines. He continued working.He refused couples therapy, but I think he was reassured by the simple fact thathis wife stayed with him.He finally asked me for Valium to take in the middle of the night, as his onemedicine to break the cycle of worry. He began to admit he was depressed, but hestill wouldn't take an antidepressant. I think he took pride in fightingdepression without pills, and used this pride to help rebuild his self-esteem.In the mornings, he willed himself to jog three miles before work. He ate two tothree meals per day but didn't binge. He allowed himself two cigars per week,calling them his one vice.He missed many doctor's visits but called me every few weeks. When he did come,I examined him and recorded his improving blood pressure. I suspected I wasrecording the physiological effects of a diminishing fear. Mostly I just sat andtalked with him in my consultation room.IS THERE A CURE FOR FEAR?There was a correlation between his returning well-being and his personalgrooming. On the same visit where I noticed his hair was combed and trimmed inthe old fashion, he told me that things were better between him and his wife; hewas no longer sleeping on the couch; he was no longer staying out late at night.He began to enjoy his cronies at work again, the brief interludes of clowningand kidding. He talked with enthusiasm about tracking down the evidence that theDA needed to convict a notorious child molester.Six months after reluctantly agreeing to Enrand's method, I measured his bloodpressure and discovered it was back down to normal without treatment. My officescale indicated that he had lost thirty pounds over that time. His cholesterolwas back below 190. Now he was sleeping through the night without Valium.Looking at him sitting relaxed on the couch across from me, I knew that I wouldbe seeing him less often, whether I scheduled appointments for him or not.\"My courage is back, Doc,\" he said.He looked at me and I was glad to see the return of his purposeful expression.\"Things were happening to me. I latched onto the worry. I could feel it, like itwas real. It gripped me, and it grew.\" \"But you fought it?\"\"Just by sticking to routines, rituals, they replaced the doubts little bylittle. When I saw I was getting my life back, I started to enjoy the routines.\"Enrand hesitated. \"Most importantly,\" he said, \"I'd always wanted to be a dad,and I loved my son more than anything, and I knew I was responsible for him. Heneeded me, and I grew stronger by refusing to let go of him.\"Now that Enrand had passed through his midlife crisis, we both realized thathe'd been doing the doctoring. He'd learned to treat—not physical illness—butfear.In the end, his plan was far better than mine. He lost weight, his bloodpressure and cholesterol went down, and his spirits and hisFALSE ALARMmarriage improved. I suspected that his stress hormones, which were responsiblefor his high blood pressure and anxiety, were now diminished.I was merely a witness to this change, though I learned a big lesson. Committinghim to three or four new pills might have led me to the erroneous conclusionthat the medicines were responsible for his improvement, rather than hiscourage. And once started, how would I have known when to stop them?AFTERWORDWe cannot maintain our historic self-confidence as a people if we generatepublic panic.—Jimmy Carter, Boston, July 26, 2004The EventDriving south on the FDR Drive just after ten o'clock in the morning, I receivea page from my answering service, but I am unable to answer it because thecircuits are suddenly busy. I notice a line of ambulances from hospitals allover New York City exiting at Twenty-third Street, bound for Bellevue Hospital.They are not responding to 911 calls, but to one massive emergency moment.The bright red-and-white-striped ambulances of Metropolitan Hospital line upbehind the black-and-orange sleek emergency vans of New York Presbyterian,following the squat ice-cream-truck-looking EMS vehicles on a line to commandcentral, designated at Bellevue.When I reach the hospital, I find it transforming before my eyes into a majorMASH unit. The emergency room proper is designated for triage, the emergencyward is filling with gowned surgeons andAFTERWORDsurgical equipment intended for early stabilization of patients, and the secondfloor is being set aside for those with walk-in injuries.On floor six, formerly the rehab area, a team of skilled phle-botomists isassembling to draw blood and take blood donations. Off to the side, there is adecontamination area, with a variety of antidotes and full body suits.Upstairs, the ward residents are busily discharging all the stable patients tofree up beds for expected admissions.In a few hours the hospital will be almost emptied of its patients. Even the ICUis being cleared, as patients on respirators are moved to the wards, freeing upspace for the worst victims of a possible catastrophe.At the front area where the ambulances come in, doctors and nurses dressed inscrubs mill about expectantly. People I have known for years, who have undergonemany changes in job description, from primary care to administrator, even toretirement, now stand shoulder to shoulder, awaiting the potential patients.\"I haven't drawn blood in years,\" the director of ambulatory medical servicessays to me. \"But I'm ready.\"The AgenciesBellevue's CBPP (chemical and biological preparation program) is meeting hourly,trying to develop a strategy. The actual terrorist tool hasn't yet been divulgedeven to the Terrorism Response Units. All that the upper echelon at Bellevueknows is that a tip has been received by one of our federal intelligenceagencies, probably the FBI.CBPP does not include preparations for a nuclear attack. Perhaps this is becausethe devastation from even a suitcase bomb would be so great that Bellevue wouldsee few survivors. More likely, it is because the government has devoted most ofits rhetoric and resources to everything besides nuclear, and the media havebeen ignoring nuclear threats in the same way that they hypeAFTERWORDairports but not seaports. Anthrax and smallpox hype have set in motion a modeof response that is misdirected and heavily weighted toward biological weapons.The public has been taught to obsess on a created fear of bacterial and viralwarfare that is well out of proportion to the real risk. In the meantime, thereis no training for radiation poisoning in our emergency disaster program, nolead-lined fallout shelters in our survival plans. The federal and localgovernments beef up the military and the police, but our coast guard remainsundermanned, and our seaports are mostly undefended.The federal government has been frighteningly ineffective in keeping track ofnuclear material and weaponry around the world.Police with sniffing dogs and radiation detectors are suddenly everywhere, andthe police commissioner announces that people on the streets should avoid anyonewho looks the least bit suspicious.The Centers for Disease Control is concerned about possible contagion and ordersa quarantine—there will be no travel to or from Manhattan until further notice.The bridges and tunnels are closed. Masses attempt to cross the Brooklyn Bridgeand the Fifty-ninth Street Bridge to escape on foot, but they are stopped andpushed back by police barriers.The MediaThe major networks break into their soap operas with special news reports everytwenty minutes, while the cable networks carry complete live coverage. There isa news team from each network stationed outside command central at BellevueHospital. The news producers eye each passing physician trying to identify whois in charge.Disaster and terrorism experts are hired instantly as cable news analysts, andthey speculate on FOX, CNN, and MSNBC all through the day about the identity ofthe weapon of mass destruction. Flipping channels back and forth on the TV inBellevue'sAFTERWORDconcrete lobby, I can see there is no consensus. There are strong assertions forand against chemical, biological, or nuclear. Nuclear is mentioned, but more forcompleteness' sake than because any of the pundits or commentators are convincedthat this old foe is truly the \"weapon du jour.\"The news coverage shows continual shots of the harbor and the Statue of Liberty,transmitting the subliminal information that the nineteenth-century gift fromFrance remains a symbolic target.The police commissioner holds a press conference to announce that every possiblemethod is being used to catch the terrorists, though he can't disclose whatthese methods are or who the terrorists might be. The mayor repeats thisstatement in a clip that is shown over and over on all the stations. He isrunning for reelection next year, and though his popularity has been plummetingwith all the trouble in the public schools, his current robust appearance on TVmakes his handlers suddenly hopeful about his chances.The impending disaster's importance is defined by the cable media's decision tocover it 24/7. The politicians are lining up to be seen pontificating on thesignificance of the news.The ProfiteersPeople are becoming so afraid that they can't concentrate on their work. Thenews that the bridges and tunnels remain closed causes a great claustrophobicfright. Businesses close down and send their employees home. Schools are closedand children mill about in the parks and on the streets. The hardware stores areflooded with people buying gas masks, duct tape, and respiratory masks. Cipro isdisappearing from the shelves of all the pharmacies, though none of thepharmacists know where the customers have gotten the Cipro prescriptions soquickly. There is no time to check for forgeries.Roving gangs of consumers are desperate for these supplies, despite their lackof knowledge of which WMD this really is. A potassium iodide manufacturer isselling millions of pills overAFTERWORDthe Internet, despite the medicine's limited use—protecting only the thyroid—inthe event of a real nuclear attack.Sleeping pill and sedative manufacturers are gearing up for a serious boost totheir sales. In the meantime, pharmacies throughout the city have run out ofValium and Xanax, while supplies of other sedatives are running low.The OutcomeAs the day goes on and nothing further happens, it slowly begins to dawn onthose of us stationed at Bellevue Hospital that the onslaught of patients maynever come. In the meantime, the wail of ambulance sirens continues to echothrough the streets.At 2 p.m. the bridges and tunnels are reopened, which goes a long way to calmingthe traumatized masses. By the time the news media actually deliver the messagethat the report is a hoax, a fraudulent memo given to Homeland Security by anunreliable source, most people are already beyond the first blush of panic. Thishas been by far the worst of all the terror alerts, and it will keep peoplenervous for a long time. Too many \"boy who cried wolf\" reports will ultimatelycause people to disregard the initial report of a real attack, if a real attackever comes.At night, Bellevue is a ghost hospital, its emptied unlit rooms looming over astunned crowd on First Avenue. Bellevue's doctors and nurses are still huddledtogether unnecessarily in the hospital's vacant emergency room.Orson Welles RevisitedThe above events are a hoax, not only on the city of New York, but also on you,the careful reader of this volume. This fallacious terror warning has not yettaken place, but I believe it can happen just this way any day. We are allsuckers for a scary story, and too willing to believe one.On October 30, 1938, Halloween Eve, when Orson WellesAFTERWORDannounced on national radio .that \"the Martians are coming,\" it was too easilyaccepted as true. The original broadcast was produced by CBS and affiliates, andperformed by a single production company, the Mercury Theatre. The so-calledmass panic that resulted was nothing compared with what we deal with today.Since then, we have become far more gullible, relying as we do on hyperbolicnews reports and speeches that sound like they were written by someone onsteroids. It is a sad state of affairs when the public is constantly cowed,shocked and awed, manipulated to be afraid, then diverted from remembering thatnothing bad actually happened. The single note of terror, September 11, 2001, isplayed over and over to juice up the audience.Realizing that we are conned into being afraid is the first step toward learninga new set of skills to assess risk. Fear must be reserved for real danger. Eachstep away from false worry is a step toward true health.BIBLIOGRAPHYINTRODUCTION: THE FEAR EPIDEMICAllison, Graham.
