Civil Lib erties is not , however, a course on l aw. It is, instead, a course t hat has as i ts subject the rel ationshi p of l aw t o the m ost fundam ental sort s of quest ions about politics, m orality, an d human nature. In th is co urse o f 36 lectu res, we sh all see th at m ost o f th e serio us difficu lties (an d th ere are m any) in th e p olitics o f civ il lib erties arise fro m co nflicts b etween our co mmitm ents to two or m ore p ositiv e v alues. Th ere are, fo r ex am ple, inevitable and recurrent conflicts (despite our attem pts to ignore them ) between the values of liberty and equality. As Fel ix Frankfurt er once wrot e, t hese and ot her such confl icts are “what the Greeks t housands of y ears ago recogni zed as a t ragi c issue, nam ely the cl ash of ri ght s, not the cl ash of wrongs.” W e exam ine these cl ashes i n light of the broader philosophical and institutional problem s of th e constitutional order. I hope to show that constitutional “answers” to problem s like those of abortion, freedom of speech, and affirm ative action require a coherent understanding of the U.S. Constitution and of the assum ptions it m akes about hum an nature and the proper ends of governm ent and ci vil soci ety. We will, th erefo re, ex am ine th e d octrin al d evelopment o f sp ecific lib erties an d rig hts, su ch as d ue process an d privacy, the ultim ate denial of liberty entailed by the death penalty, freedom of speech and religion, and equal prot ect ion, but we shal l consi der t hem in a broader t heoret ical cont ext .

The course is divided into three s ections. W e begin with the institutiona l and interpretive foundations of the Am erican constitutional order. Our purpose here is to pr ovide students with background on the U.S. Suprem e Court and its ro le in th e co nstitu tio nal o rder, as well as an overview o f th e p rocess o f co nstitu tio nal in terp retatio n. In our first lect ure, for exam ple, we focus on t he organi zat ion, com posi tion, and deci sion-m aking aut hori ty of t he C ourt . In our second lecture, we take up the “why” and the “what” of constitutional interpretation. W e shall see that interpretation is both a choice and a necessity: a choice because we m ust choose am ong many diverse m ethods and strategies, and a burden because such choi ces are often difficult to justify or even to explain. In Lectures Three and Fo ur, we tak e up th e in tersectio n of Lectu res On e an d Two by co nsiderin g how an d wh y th e p ower o f co nstitu tio nal interp retatio n— and, hence, th e p ower to decid e th e m ost p ressin g issu es o f civ il lib erties—cam e to rest with th e Suprem e C ourt through t he m echani sm of judi cial revi ew. In the second section of the course, we begin our inquiry into the Bill of Right s. In every case that arises under the Bill of Rights, we m ust reconcile our desire for individual liberty with the need for public order, personal autonom y with th e n eed s o f th e co mmunity. Co nsidered in its to tality, an d not sim ply p rovisio n by provisio n, a b ill o f rig hts sketch es th e b road outlin es o f th e relatio nship between in dividual lib erty an d th e n eed s o f th e co mmunity. In th is larger sense, a bill of rights indicates how conflicts between liberty and co mmunity should be conceived and, to some ex ten t, reso lved. In our fifth lectu re, we co nsider th e h isto ry an d th eory o f th e Bill o f Rig hts. W as a b ill o f rights really necessary? And why, in itially, did its protections run only ag ainst the federal governm ent, not the states? In t he si xth l ect ure, we t ake up t he fasci nating doct rine of incorporatio n , or t he torturous and wi ndi ng road the Court followed to m ake the Bill of Rights applicable to state and lo cal governm ents—arguably a constitutional revol ution no l ess si gni ficant than t he Foundi ng i n Phi ladel phi a. In th e th ird an d, by far, th e larg est sectio n of th e course, com prising 30 l ect ures, we consi der t he indi vidual provisions of the Bill of Rights and the developm ent of several other specific lib erties. In deference to the Founders, we b egin with th e co nstitu tio nal rig ht to property.

W e start with speech. Am ong the issues we will consider will be the definition of speech, hate speech and fi ghting words, indecency and pornography , and freedom of associ ation. Our exam ination of t he rel igion cl auses l ikewi se includes quest ions concerni ng t he defi nition of rel igion, as wel l as consi dera tion of t he m eani ng of t he es tablishm ent and free exercise clauses and how they interact. In the final part of the course, we explore the m any intr icacies of the equal protecti on clause of the Fourteenth Am endm ent. W hen, if ever, does the equal protection clause allow the state to discrim inate on the basis of race? Is there a co nstitu tio nal d ifferen ce b etween m alig nant discrim inatio n, su ch as Jim Cro w laws, an d affirm ativ e actio n, or so-called “reverse discrim ination” ?

Scope: Thi s lect ure i ntroduces st udent s to the overal l them es of t he course and t o the m ethods and m aterials we will u se in our stu dy of civ il lib erties. W e begin with a m islead ingly sim ple q uestio n: W hat are civil lib erties ? There is not an easy or a single answer to this que stion. W e will see, too, I hope, that m ost of the serio us difficu lties (an d th ere are m any) in civ il lib erties arise fro m co nflicts b etween our co mmitm ents to two or m ore p ositiv e v alues. Th ere are, fo r ex am ple, in evitab le an d recu rren t co nflicts b etween th e v alues of liberty and equality. I hope to show that constitutional “answers” to su ch questions as abortion, freedom of speech, and affirm ative action require a coherent understanding of the Constitution and of the assum ptions i t m akes about hum an nat ure and t he proper ends of governm ent and ci vil soci ety. Outline I. We begin with an overview o f th is co urse an d th e k inds of questio ns it will ex plore. As we sh all see, th e Constitution is a wonderfully sparse yet com plex vision of the ideal polity. A. Part of t hat com plexity resul ts from the Founders’ com mitment to several com plementary but som etimes confl icting goal s. For exam ple, t here are i nevi table tensi ons bet ween t he Founders’ com mitment to dem ocracy and t o the prot ect ion of i ndi vidual libert ies. The prot ect ion of ci vil libert ies is one of t he cent ral purposes o f th e Co nstitu tio n, but it is n ot th e o nly o ne. B. In addition, a sophisticated unders tanding of the Constitution includes recognition of the assum ptions it makes about hum an nat ure and t he proper ends of gove rnm ent and ci vil soci ety. W e m ust ask: W hat overal l concept ion of l ibert ies, ri ght s, and governm ental powers m ost nearl y refl ect s and prom otes our best understanding of the Constitution? C. When we ask, “W hat are civil lib erties ?” we t hus ask a num ber of di ffe rent but rel ated quest ions—som e technical, som e philosophical. In a ddressing them , we will consult a num ber of different sources, including the Fed eralist Pa pers and the occasional work of m oral philo sophy, but for the m ost part, our source material will b e th e d ecisio ns of th e U.S. Su prem e Co urt. II. There are as m any approaches to th e field of civil liberties as there ar e professors who teach the m aterial. A. Som e professors, for exam ple, prefer to take a doctrin al approach to the m ateri al or an approach that focuses on the current state of the law. B. Other professors are grounded m ore in political science th an in law, and they are more inclined to teach about the Constitution and the Cour t as grounded fundam entally in politics or to treat the Court and constitu tio nal in terp retatio n as p olitical co nstru cts. C. As suggested by m y openi ng rem arks, m y approach is grounded funda mentally in political theory and the kind of cri tical inqui ry that is the hal lmark of a l iberal art s educat ion. In ot her words, I begi n wi th the assum ption that a course on civil liberties ought to dr aw on the skills and strengths that a liberal arts educat ion prom otes. 1. As taught in law school, constitutional law asks students to concentrate on technical rules and doctrines. In m y view, a course on civil liberties a nd the Bill of Rights ought to help students to think critically about the fundam ental pr inciples and policies of the cons titutional order. A liberal arts approach seeks to push such issues back to their foundation in social , m oral, and political theory, thus promptin g stu dents to en gage th e g reat issu es o f political life ad dressed by th e Co nstitu tio n an d constitu tio nal in terp retatio n. 2. Am ong these issues are questions about the m eani ng of justice and equality and, ultim ately, the meaning of Am erica itself. III. The com plexity of t he topi c, and t he great num ber and vari ety of sources we m ight consul t, m eans t hat we m ust make som e di fficul t choi ces about what we can cover and what we m ust om it in this course. A. First, we will lim it o ur co verag e to th e Bill o f Rig hts an d th e o ther am endments to th e Co nstitu tio n, or to what are typically called civil lib erties , not civil rights . 1. By civil rights , we m ean th ose rig hts estab lish ed by leg islatio n, not directly b y th e Co nstitu tio n itself. ©2006 The Teaching Com pany Lim ited Partnership 3"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 2. For exam ple, we will not have an opportunity to c over such areas as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or the Vot ing R ight s Act of 1975, even t hough bot h act s are of profound i mport ance. B. Sim ilarly, there are som e provisions in the Bill of Rights, such as the Second Am endm ent and the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Am endm ents, that we will not address. These am endm ents, although obviously im portant, are t ypical ly covered i n courses on cri minal proce dure and woul d requi re a ful l course of t heir own. C. Finally, we will not have room in th is course to consider rights that trace their source to international law or i nternat ional agreem ent s, though, of course, m any of t hose ri ght s are si milar in descri ption and cont ent to counterparts in the Am erican Bill of Rights. IV. On the other hand, there is m uch that we should and will cover in the next 35 lectures. A. We will b egin with an overview o f th e Bill o f Rig hts as a wh ole. As we will see, th e Bill o f Rig hts was n ot inevitab le. 1. The Philadelphia Convention, in fact , failed to subm it a bill of rights to the states for ratification. 2. There were m ultiple reasons for this failure, som e grounded in political theory and others in political strategy. B. We will also sp end so me tim e ex ploring th e d evelopment o f judicial review . 1. Th e co ncep t itself is n eith er in th e Bill o f Rig hts n or in th e Co nstitu tio n m ore g enerally, at least explicitly, but it is central to understanding the rela tionship between the Suprem e Court and the Bill of Right s. 2. We will also need to sp end so me tim e, th erefo re, d iscu ssin g th e h isto ry, co mpositio n, an d fu nctio ns of the U.S. Suprem e Court. C. Th ereafter, we will b egin to tak e up th e sp ecific lib erties in clu ded in th e Bill o f Rig hts an d other p arts o f the Co nstitu tio n, su ch as th e Fo urteen th Am endment. D. We begi n, fai rly convent ional ly, wi th an exam ination of t he ri ght to propert y. 1. At the Founding, property was perhaps the m ost significant of constitutional liberties. 2. In addition, we begin with property because the si gnificance of property has d eclined dram atically, or, I should say, its weight as a constituti onal liberty has declined substantially. E. Following property, I will take up the constitutional right to privacy. This shift is som ewhat unusual, but there are good reasons for t aking t his approach. 1. First , m ost of t he C ourt ’s earl y pri vacy cases i nvol ved propert y right s as wel l. 2. Second, I will argue that privacy m eans to our ge neration what property m ean t to earlier generations— that it serv es th e sam e kind of fu nctio n in th e co nstitu tio nal o rder. F. After privacy, we will take up the First Am endm ent. I have prepared several lectures j ust on the speech clauses and several on t he rel igion cl auses. 1. These m aterials are exceptionally com plex. W e will spend a fair am ount of tim e considering the doctrinal rules that govern speech, but in every case, I want to driv e the m aterials back to larger quest ions of t heory and pri nciple. 2. For exam ple, we will consider not only specific issues, including hate sp eech and pornography, but also the larger issues these and other topics raise, su ch as: W hat is th e d efin itio n of speech ? W hen, if ever, is it perm issible for the state to restrict speech, and for what reasons? 3. We will spend an equal am ount of tim e considering sim ilar questions when we take up freedom of relig ion. W hat is th e d efin itio n of relig ion ? W ho shoul d have t he aut hori ty to deci de? Is t here a constitu tio nally relev ant distin ctio n between th e freed om to believ e an d th e freed om to act o n belief? G. After we co nclude our treatm ent of th e First Am endment, we will sp end sev eral lectu res o n th e eq ual prot ect ion cl ause of t he Fourt eent h Am endm ent . 1. First, we will consider the various problem s in equal protection that ar e occasioned by racial discri minat ion. 2. Second, we will take up other areas of discrim inati on, such as discrim inati on based on gender, age, weal th, and sexual ori entation. ©2006 The Teaching Com pany Lim ited Partnership 4"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" Essentia l Rea ding : The Constitution of the United States, Article III.

Som e of the Founders, as we sh all see in this lecture, believed that a bill of rights was, at best , unnecessary and, at worst , ev en a th reat to lib erty. In th is l ect ure, we expl ore t he hi story of t he Bill of Rights, considering, first, whether and why a bill of rights wa s necessary and, second, why it took the fo rm it d id. As we saw in Lectu re On e, we will n ot be ab le to co nsider ev ery p rovisio n of th e Bill o f Rig hts, an d, sad ly, we will n ot be ab le to ad dress an y sin gle p rovisio n in as m uch depth as we m ight lik e. The First Am endm ent’s provisions on speech alone woul d m erit an entire course, as m ight the religious freedom clauses of t he sam e am endm ent . And m any of the topics we shall consider are not, strictly speaking, a part of the Bill of Rights proper. W e sha ll, for instance, spend a fa ir am ount of tim e with the due process and equal prot ect ion cl auses of t he Four teen th Am endment. Lik e th e First Am endment, th e Fo urteen th is a stap le o f m odern co nstitu tio nal litig atio n. Although it m ay seem peculiar to m odern sensibilities, one of the m ost im portant issues surrounding the Bill of Rights concerns its application: Does it protect citizens against the federal governm ent only or also agai nst the act ions of st ate governm ents? Thi s was t he issue i n the sem inal case of Ba rro n v. Ba ltimo re (1833), in which Chief Justice John Marshall, writing fo r the Court, concluded th at the Bill of Rights did not apply to the states. W e then consider whether and to what extent that decision was effectively overt urned by the passage of t he Fourt eent h Am endm ent and how t he C ourt approached t hat quest ion i n the y ears i mmediately fol lowing t he C ivil W ar. W e concl ude by consi deri ng t he doct rine of incorporatio n , or th e p rocess b y wh ich th e Su prem e Co urt, o ver tim e, fin ally m ade in dividual p rovisio ns of th e Bill o f Right s appl icabl e to the st ates by incorporat ing, or i ncludi ng, t hem in the due process cl ause of t he Fourt eent h Am endm ent . Outline I. The Constitution produced in Philadelphi a did not contain a bill of rights. I ndeed, the subject cam e up hardly at all at the convent ion. A. Its om ission becam e an im portant part of the ratifi cation debates. Eventually, several states m ade the addition of a bill of rights a key conditi on to their decision to ratify—known as conditional ratification . B. In other words, several states in sisted that they would not ratify the new Constitution without a bill of rights. A bill of rights thus becam e a precondition for the new Constitution. II. The dem ands for a bill of rights gave rise to an im por tant and sophisticated disc ussion about the nature and lim its o f rig hts in th e Am erican co nstitu tio nal o rder. A. Alexander Ham ilton and Jam es M adison, wri ting i n the Fed eralist Pa pers , arg ued th at a b ill o f rig hts was unnecessary, because the Constitution itself was a lim ited docum ent of enum erated powers. Ham ilton went so far as to suggest that a bill of rights “would even be dangerous.... For why declare that things shall not be done whi ch t here i s not power t o do? ” B. Madison argued, i n addi tion, t hat no l ist of l ibert ies coul d ever hope t o be com plete, and t his m ight lead governm ents to abridge liberties that were not explic itly listed as protected. Moreover, m ere “parchm ent barri ers,” he wrot e, coul d not prot ect libert y. 1. Th is is an in terestin g arg ument. If tak en to an ex trem e, its lo gic—th at wo rds alo ne will n ot lim it power—undercuts the constitutional enterprise. 2. On th e o ther h and, perhaps it is a m istak e to th ink of th e Co nstitu tio n or th e Bill o f Rig hts as “m ere parchm ent barri ers.” C. In co ntrast, an ti-Fed eralists arg ued th at a b ill o f rig hts wo uld do no harm , an d Jefferso n, in particu lar, argued t hat such a docum ent m ight have an i mport ant educat ional purpose. In addi tion, Jefferson argued that a b ill o f rig hts m ight put “a leg al ch eck ... in th e h ands of th e judiciary.” 1. Th is is a little iro nic—Jefferso n was q uite sk eptical o f judicial p ower, as we sh all see wh en we tak e up Marbury v. Madison (1803). ©2006 The Teaching Com pany Lim ited Partnership 6"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 2. Jefferson’s first argum ent—that a bill of rights m ight constitute a public rem inder of our com mitm ent to liberty—hints at a con ception of the Bill of Rights grounded in civic education. III. As he had prom ised in the ratifica tion debates, Madison subm itted a bill of rights to the very first Congress, and an am ended version was subm itted to th e states shortly thereafter and ratifie d in 1791. Before we consider the individual provisions of the Bill of Rights, we need to look at it as a whole. A. Co nsidered in its to tality, a b ill o f rig hts sk etch es th e b road outlin es o f th e relatio nship between lib erty an d community. A b ill o f rig hts is a b lueprint—less a list o f lib erties th an a v isio n of th e id eal relatio nship between lib erty an d co mmunity. B. In every case that arises under the Bill of Rights, we must reconcile our desire for individual liberty with the need for publ ic order, personal aut onom y wi th the needs of t he com muni ty. C. In th is co urse, we will ad dress th ose p rovisio ns in th e Bill o f Rig hts th at h ave ten ded to generate th e m ost cont roversy and case l aw. 1.

IV. Passage of the Bill of Rights did not quiet all controversy. The language of the am endm ents seem ed to leave open t he quest ion of whet her t hey appl ied t o the federal governm ent alone or al so t o the st ates. A. Inherent in this unresol ved ques tion were t wo very di fferent concept ions of l ibert y and com muni ty. B. Madison, for exam ple, thought the Bill of Rights ought to apply to bot h, because the federal and state governm ents were equal ly likely to threat en l ibert y. C. Most ant i-Federal ists, however, were m ore fearful of t hreat s by a rem ote federal governm ent. They believed the proxim ity of state a nd local governm ents to their citizen s m ade those governm ents less likely to abuse power. V. The Suprem e C ourt took up t his issue i n the very import ant case of Ba rro n v. Ba ltimo re (1833). A. Writing for the Court, Chief Justice John Marshall conc luded that the Bill of Rights applied only to the nat ional governm ent. 1. The Bill of Rights reflected the Founders’ fears that the new governm ent m ight exceed its powers. “Th e Co nstitu tio n was o rdained an d estab lish ed by th e p eople o f th e Un ited States fo r th em selv es ... and not for t he governm ent of t he indi vidual states.” 2. Im plicit in M arshal l’s deci sion i s a part icular underst andi ng about the rel ationshi p am ong t he nat ional governm ent, state governm ents, and citizens. B. Barron is an im portant case, in part because it m ade cl ear that the liberties contai ned in the Bill of Rights did not prot ect citizens agai nst act ions t aken by state governm ents. VI. Fol lowing t he C ivil W ar, C ongress rat ified t he Thi rteent h, Fourt eent h, and Fi fteent h Am endm ent s, or t he Reconst ruct ion Am endm ent s. Som e judges soon began t o ask whet her t hose am endm ent s, in part icular t he Fourteenth, should be underst ood as m aking the Bill of Rights applicable to states, thus overruling, at least in consequence, Barron .

DeShaney is im portant because it teaches about two other issu es co ncern ing th e b read th an d sco pe of th e Bill o f Rig hts.

W hat d oes it m ean to say th at a rig ht is g uaran teed ? Do es it m ean only that the governm ent m ay not interfere with the ri ght, save on certain conditions?

Here, t he C ourt rul ed t hat the due process cl ause of t he Fourt eent h Am endm ent prot ect s due process ri ght s onl y agai nst state act ors, not agai nst the act ions of pri vate persons. 1. We begi n wi th the fact s of t he DeShaney case, which are exceptionally tragic. a.

The l ect ure al so i ntroduces st udent s to the complex ities o f constitutional interpretation , whi ch m ay be defi ned as t he vari ous way s by whi ch judges and others seek to determ ine what the Constitution act ually m eans. W e begin w ith an obvious but vitally im portant question: W hy is constitutional interpretati on necessary? W e will consider the various sources and m ethods of constitutional interpretation, such as textu alism , originalism , doctrin alism , precedent , and structuralism . Th e d efin itio ns of th ese v ario us term s, we sh all see, are also open to dispute. W e will also fin d th at co nstitu tio nal arg uments m ay b e drawn fro m a v ariety o f possib le so urces. Outline I. Mu ch of th e Co nstitu tio n, at least wh en ap plied to hard cases, is su fficien tly v ague to req uire so me interp retatio n to get at its m ean ing. Co nsequently, wh at we call constitutional law is bet ter thought of as constitutional interpretation . There are at least three reasons for this vagueness. A. First, language i s alway s an i mperfect and i mpreci se m eans of com muni cat ion, and especi ally so when t he underl ying concept s, such as l ibert y, power, and au thori ty, are t hem sel ves cont roversi al and vague. B. Second, som etim es the Founders deliberately sought constitutional am biguity, in part because vague constitutional provisions allow fo r com prom ise and cooperation. C. Third, the Constitution is vague also because th e Founders knew that the docum ent would have to incorporate change over tim e. II. There are various m ethods and sources of constitutional inte rpretation. In this lecture, we will explore a few of the m ore com mon m ethods, i ncludi ng t he fol lowing: A. Textualism . 1. Text ual ism is a m ethod of i nterpret ation t hat suggest s that we consul t, first and, perhaps, l ast, the actual language of the Constitution. 2. As a m ethod, t his has obvi ous appeal , but it also suffers from a profound fl aw: In m ost cases, i t is the language i tself—i ts m addeni ng am bigui ty—t hat is the reason why we need t o interpret in the fi rst place. B. Founders’ Int ent/Original ism . 1. Som e justices suggest that in interpreting the C onstitution, we should look to the intentions of the Fram ers. Th is, to o, has an in tuitiv e ap peal, b ut th ere are p roblem s as well. 2. Which of t he Founders shoul d we consul t and why ? 3. Rem ember, to o, th at we h ave little ev idence o f wh at th ey in ten ded—the d ocumentary reco rds are sparse an d in complete. 4. There are also serious definiti onal difficulties: W ho, exactly, is a Founder? And shouldn’t we look to the rat ifying convent ions as wel l? 5. Som e justices, such as Scalia, have favored a sl ight ly di fferent approach, t ypical ly cal led originalism . Inst ead of seeki ng evi dence about intentions, ori ginalists ask us t o consi der and appl y the “ori ginal ” mean ings of vario us provisio ns of th e Co nstitu tio n. Balancing and Prudentialism Two other m ethods of constitutional interpretation m entioned but not exam ined in this lecture are bal anci ng and prudent ialism. In bal anci ng , judges wei gh one set of i nterest s or ri ght s agai nst anot her set of i nterest s or ri ght s. Thi s method i s oft en found i n Fi rst Am endm ent cases. So, for exam ple, i n such cases t he C ourt oft en speaks about the need to reconcile—or to balan ce—our com mitm ent to freedom of speech with other constitutional values, ©2006 The Teaching Com pany Lim ited Partnership 11"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" such as eq uality o r th e d ignity o f other p erso ns. Critics o f th is ap proach , su ch as Ju stice Fran kfurter, som etim es observe in response that the Constitution itself gives us no guidance about how to weigh or measure di fferent interest s, and t hus no way to bal ance t hem . Pru dentia lism counsels judges to avoid setti ng broad rules for future cases and offers a particular understanding of the lim ited role courts should play in a constitutional de mocracy. Justice Frankfurter often counsel ed such an approach, not ing for exam ple, i n the two Fl ag Sal ute Cases t hat judges m ust alway s be alert to the way s in whi ch exerci ses of judi cial power m ay be fundam entally undem ocrat ic. C. Do ctrin alism . 1. Doctrinal m ethods of interpretati on consider how various parts of the Constitution have been shaped by the C ourt ’s own juri sprudence. 2. As we shall see, nearly every area in civil libert ies has gi ven ri se t o a doct rine of one sort or anot her, and so me of our tim e in th is co urse will b e sp ent learn ing th ese d octrin es an d ev alu atin g th em . D. Precedent . 1. Closely related to the interpretive m ethod of doctrinalism is the m ethod of precedent. 2. When a court uses precedent, it sim ply refers to an earlier case, finding in it a rule or principle that governs t he current case as wel l. E. Struct ural ism . 1. Although i t m ay seem m ore com plex t han ot her m ethods of i nterpret ation, st ruct ural ism rest s on a sim ple p rincip le—th at o ne can fin d th e m ean ing of a p articu lar co nstitu tio nal p rincip le o nly b y read ing it ag ain st th e larg er co nstitu tio nal d ocument o r co ntext. 2. There are, as we shal l see, several vari ations of t his m ethod. III. Because so m uch of our work will consist of reading Suprem e Court decisions, we begin with an exam ination of th e Su prem e Co urt an d its ro le in th e co nstitu tio nal o rder. A. Perhaps surprisingly, the Constitution proper actually has very little to sa y about the m akeup of the federal court system in general and of the Suprem e Court in particular. Article III of the Constitution provides som e of t he skel etal m aterial, but m uch of t he operat ion and funct ioni ng of t he C ourt is a consequence of evol ution and change. B. A study of the Bill of Rights, then, is at least partly an inquiry into th e history of the Suprem e Court as an evolving in stitu tio n. IV. If we are to understand the Court, there are three ar eas we will need to expl ore in greater detail. A. First, we need to understand the com position of the C ourt; in particular, we need to know how the Court is staffed and t he process and cont roversi es surroundi ng nom inations t o the C ourt . B. Second, we need t o underst and t he nat ure and l imits of judi cial power, or what we shal l cal l jurisd ictio n , especially as derived from Ar ticle III of the Constitution. C. Thi rd, we need t o know how t he C ourt goes about the busi ness of sel ect ing whi ch cases t o hear and deci ding t hem . 1. Yo u can see ex actly wh at ru les th e Co urt u ses to assess wh eth er a case will b e heard at: http://www.suprem ecourt us.gov/ ctrul es/ctrul es.ht ml 2. Where t here i s confl ict am ong l ower court s over how t o rul e in a part icular case, t he C ourt m ay be more lik ely to tak e th e case an d to try to settle th at co nflict. 3. Although t here was an earl ier poi nt in the C ourt ’s hi story when t he C ourt was t heoret ical ly obl igated to hear cert ain ki nds of federal cases, t he C ourt ha s long si nce di scarded t hat, and now i ts di scret ion i s full. Th ere is n o set o f cases th at th e Co urt is g enuinely o blig ated to hear. 4. Acco rding to th e politica l questio n doctrin e , som e quest ions, i n their nat ure, are fundam entally political and not legal; and if a que stion is fundam entally political a nd not legal, then the Court m ay refuse to hear that case. 5. The Court som etim es says that it will not hear a case because the case is not “ripe” (the underlying controversy isn’t fully realized yet) or is “m oot” (the case dies before it can be heard, e.g., because the parties have reached an agreem ent) . More generally, the Court, indeed all federal courts, only decide concrete, “live” cases. ©2006 The Teaching Com pany Lim ited Partnership 12"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" Essentia l Rea ding : Kom mers, Fi nn, and Jacobsohn, American Constitutional Law , chapt ers 1–2.

M adison and Judicial Review Scope: This lecture introduces st udent s to the pract ice of judicial review , or t he aut hori ty of t he Suprem e C ourt and other federal courts to declare som e governm ental action unconstitutional. On som e accounts, the power o f judicial rev iew is th e co rnersto ne of th e Am erican co nstitu tio nal o rder. W heth er th is is tru e or not, this lecture will trace the early beginnings of the doctrine, beginning w ith Alexander Ham ilton’s defense of t he doct rine in Fed eralist no. 78. As we shal l see, m any of Ham ilton’s argum ent s were echoed in Chief Just ice John M arshal l’s opi nion for t he C ourt in the cel ebrat ed case of Marbury v. Madison (1803). In t his lect ure, we expl ore t he logi c of Marbury in greater d etail. W e will co nclude with criticism s of Marbury , especi ally as devel oped by Thom as Jefferson. In part icular, we consi der exact ly what ki nd of claim Marsh all m ade. Did he claim th at th e Su prem e Co urt is th e fin al, u ltim ate in terp reter o f th e Co nstitu tio n? Or d id he claim only th at th e Co urt m ust h ave at least an eq ual rig ht to in terp ret? Th is is still an open, co ntroversial q uestio n in co nstitu tio nal law. Do es th e Am erican system of judicial rev iew est ablish judi cial suprem acy , or does i t prom ote the latter underst andi ng, som etimes cal led departmen talism ? The l ect ure concl udes by suggest ing t hat there i s probabl y not a si ngl e cl ear answer t o the question, thus underscoring the com plex ity of the Am erican constitutional order. Outline I. Judicial review is o ne of th e co rnersto nes o f th e Am erican co nstitu tio nal o rder. A. Judicial rev iew, d efin ed in brief, is th e au thority o f a co urt to nullify an y law o r policy th at v iolates th e Co nstitu tio n. B. Judi cial revi ew i s not sy nony mous wi th constitutional review ; th e au thority to declare a law in compatib le with the Constitution need not be vested in courts or judges. 1. There is nothing in Article III, or any other part of the constitutional te xt, that clearly gives judges this authority. 2. Th e p ower o f co nstitu tio nal rev iew ex ists in other co nstitu tio nal d emocracies, su ch as Fran ce [v ia th e Conseil constitutionnel ], but it is not vest ed i n judges. II. Although there are colonial antecedents, the doctrine of judicial review in th e United States is largely the result of C hief Just ice John M arshal l’s opi nion for t he C ourt in the cel ebrat ed case of Marbury v. Madison (1803). A. As is true of so m any of the cases we will consid er, it is im portant to understand the political context of Marbury. At stake i n the case were di fferent vi sions of Am eri ca, as wel l as di fferent underst andi ngs about such i mport ant concept s as separat ion of powers and checks and bal ances. 1. We begi n wi th the presi dent ial elect ion of 1800 bet ween John Adam s and Thom as Jefferson and t he so-cal led “m idni ght ” judges appoi nted by Adam s in the last m oments of hi s presi dency . 2. Once i t was cl ear t hat the Federal ists had l ost cont rol of t he presi dency and C ongress t o the Jeffersonians, they reacted, in part, by “retreating,” in Jefferson’s term s, to the judiciary. As a part of this strategy, the Federalists created several new pos itions of “justices of the peace” for the District of Co lumbia, award ed to Fed eralists. 3. One of those j ustices of the peace was W illiam Mar bury, who sued the new secretary of state, Jam es Madison, t o get hi s appoi ntment. 4. The l awsui t invoked t he C ourt ’s “ori ginal ” juri sdi ction and was of such consequence t o lead t he new Congress t o cancel the C ourt ’s 1801–1802 t erm . B. Chief Just ice M arshal l wrot e the opi nion for t he C ourt . The opi nion hel d for M adison i nsofar as M arshal l rul ed t hat the C ourt di d not have juri sdi ction t o grant M arbury rel ief. B ut m ore broadl y, M arshal l claimed for the Court the extr aordinary authority to declare an act of Congress unconstitutional. C. Marshall’s opinion for the Court was deceptively sim ple: He declared that under the Constitution, “it is em phat ical ly the provi nce and dut y of t he judi cial depart ment to say what the law i s.” 1. Fro m th is an d other p rem ises, Marsh all reaso ned th at th e Co nstitu tio n’s statu s as “su prem e Law” m ust mean t hat it cont rol s inferi or act s and l aws and t hat judges, by warrant of t heir oat hs, t heir legal ©2006 The Teaching Com pany Lim ited Partnership 14"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" training, and t heir aut hori ty under Art icle III t o hear cases and cont roversi es, m ust have t he power of judicial review. 2. Marshal l offered several ot her just ificat ions for judi cial revi ew, but none goes t o the real issue i n the case. III. Marshall’s opinion for the Court, although celebrated by som e, m et with serious criticism from President Jefferson, as wel l as from som e ot her judges. A. President Jefferson, for exam ple, argued that Marsha ll’s opi nion el evat ed t he C our t from a branch separate but equal to a branch independent a nd superior. Jefferson even went so far as to call for the im peachm ent of federal judges who woul d dare t o di sal low act s of the coordi nat e and equal branches of t he federal governm ent. B. In another criticism , Judge John Gibson of the Pennsylvania Suprem e Court argued that the doctrine of check s an d balan ces weig hed ag ain st judicial rev iew. Ab uses o f th e Co nstitu tio n, he arg ued, co uld be forest alled by that sy stem and shoul d be correct ed, not by court s, but by the peopl e them sel ves i n their exerci se of soverei gn power. IV. Ch ief Ju stice Marsh all claim ed in Marbury that the Suprem e C ourt m ust have t he power of judi cial revi ew. B ut what exactly does that power entail? Two centuries after Marbury , judges and schol ars al ike cont inue t o disagree about bot h t he breadt h and t he dept h of t hat power. A. One underst andi ng of t he power suggest s a t heory known as judi cial supremacy , or the claim that in any conflict over the Constitution’s m eaning, judges’ interp retations should prevail over the interpretations of other branches. Som e passages and suggest ions i n Marbury v. Madison seem to support this account. Alexander Ham ilton had fi rst elaborat ed t his posi tion i n “Federal ist No. 78.” B. Anot her approach, however, suggest s that the C ourt claimed onl y a co-equal right to interpret the Co nstitu tio n fo r itself, n ot a b roader, m ore fin al in terp retiv e au thority. V. These two readings of Marbury gi ve ri se t o two very di fferent unde rst andi ngs about the power of judi cial rev iew an d, in deed , o f th e p roper ro le o f th e Su prem e Co urt in th e p olity. A. Judi cial supremacy underscores a constitutional order in which conflicts over constitutional m eaning are settled largely by judges. In Cooper v. Aaron (1958), the Court said, in effect , “W e are the final, ultim ate interp reter o f th e Co nstitu tio n.” B. Dep artmen talism , on the other hand, assum es that all bran ches have an ongoing and equal responsibility for determ ining what the Constitution m eans. This is , the Jeffersonian understandi ng: in cases of genuine conflict, th e b ranches m ust u ltim ately seek so me kind of political reso lutio n or political co mpromise am ongst them selves, and if they cannot reach a resoluti on, ultim ately, it will revert to the people to m ake these ki nds of deci sions C. Am erican constitutional history and ongoing practice teach us that neith er understanding of the power of judicial review is the “correct” one. 1.

In deed , th e o riginal tex t of th e Co nstitu tio n, before th ere was a Bill o f Rig hts, was riddl ed t hrough wi th prot ect ions for propert y. In t his lect ure, we ask why the Founders, Federal ists and ant i-Federal ists alike, were so i ntent on prot ect ing prope rty, and we begin to consider the m echanism s they devi sed for doi ng so. W hat di d t he Founders m ean by propert y ? As we revi ew t heir work and t he C ourt ’s earliest cases, we will see that the Founders’ conceptions of liberty and property were wonderfully rich and com plex. W e shal l see, t oo, t hat behi nd t hose c oncept ions were i mport ant underst andi ngs about what it means to be free, what it m eans to be a citizen, and what constitutes good govern ment and civic virtue. Am ong the cases we will explore are Calder v. Bull (1798), Fletcher v. Peck (1810), and Charl es Ri ver Bri dge v. Warren Bri dge (1837). Outline I. Before we t ake up our exam ination of part icular cases , th is m ay b e an ap propriate tim e to say a few wo rds about Suprem e C ourt opi nions and how t o read t hem . A. A judi cial opi nion i s bot h an act of expl anat ion and of persuasi on. B. Most opi nions purport to expl ain how t he judge or judges arri ved at a deci sion, usual ly by traci ng a seri es of quest ions, answers, and argum ent s from a set begi nni ng t o a seem ingl y inevi table end. In t his sense, a judicial opinion helps to ensure the accountability of power—a fundam ental constitutional im perative—by declaring in public the reasons why a case ha s been deci ded i n a part icular way . C. Every judi cial opi nion i s an exerci se i n persuasi on. Di fficult cases, at least, often adm it of m ore than one solutio n. 1. A judge who fai ls to say why hi s or her sol ution i s preferabl e to anot her, no l ess obvi ous, sol ution i s a judge who has failed to understand the difference betw een judicial power, or the capacity to reach a decision, and judicial authority—that is, the circum stances under which it is constitutionally appropriate to reach a decision. 2. Judi cial aut hori ty requi res an underst andi ng of t he proper nat ure and l imits of judi cial power i n a constitutional dem ocracy as well as an understanding of the reasons that a judge has a constitutional obl igation t o tell us why , to persuade us , that hi s or her sol ution i s superi or. D. There are ot her purposes t o opi nions, as wel l. [Not e: Opi nions al so have m ore t han one audi ence— sometim es th e litig ants alo ne, so metim es leg al sch olars, an d so metim es th e en tire p olity.] In ev ery case, then, st udent s shoul d read for t he fol lowing i nform ation: 1. Legal doct rine : W hat quest ion of l aw does t he case rai se? How do t he judges or just ices answer t hat questio n? W hat d octrin es o f law d o th ey u tilize o r fo rm ulate? Do es th eir an swer co nform to ex istin g leg al d octrin e o r does it ch ange it? 2. Institutional role : Alm ost every constitutional case decide d by the Suprem e Court involves som e question about the proper role of the Court in th e political process. W hat understanding of judicial power does the m ajority em brace? Does the opinion e nvision a broad or a narrow role for the power of judges? Does t hat vi sion rest on a part icular underst andi ng of dem ocrat ic theory and of t he aut hori ty of the com munity to govern itself thr ough the m eans of m ajoritarian politic s? Does it rest on a particular view about when judges shoul d prot ect indi vidual libert y from regul ation by a m ajori ty? 3. Methods and strategies of c onstitutional interpretation : Tran slatin g th e “m ajestic g eneralities” o f th e Constitution into a practical inst rum ent of governance requires inte rpretation. W hat m ethods and strategies of interpretation do th e judges em ploy? Do they explic itly acknowledge their choices? Do they just ify them ? W hat sort s of just ificat ions and evi dence does t he opi nion m arshal to support its argum ent? 4. Co mmen tary o n th e America n polity : As I said earlier, a course on constitutional law should be a com mentary on the m eaning of Am erica. Judicial opi nions can be a rich source for such com mentary. ©2006 The Teaching Com pany Lim ited Partnership 17"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" As y ou read t hem , consi der what an opi nion say s about Am eri can hi story , about cont em porary politics, about political theory, and about the su ccess or failure of the Am erican experim ent. II. The Pream ble to the Constitution includes am ong its purpos es to “secure the Blessings of Liberty.” Chief am ong those blessings and, hence, f oundational to the new constitutional or der was the protection of private propert y. A. When t he Founders spoke of propert y, they m eant not a si ngl e ri ght but , rat her, an expansi ve col lect ion of libert ies. These i ncluded t he ri ght to own propert y, as wel l as t he ri ght of propert ied m en t o part icipate in governance. 1. Indeed, t he prot ect ion of propert y was so i mport ant that the Founders i ncluded several provi sions i n the ori ginal text, includi ng Art icle I, sect ion 10, whi ch prohi bits ex post facto laws an d laws im pairin g the obl igation of cont ract s. 2. Nor can we ful ly appreci ate the si gni ficance of propert y wi thout underst andi ng how expansi ve the defi nition of propert y was. M adison, for exam ple, wrot e: “A m an has a propert y in hi s opi nions and the free com muni cat ion of t hose opi nions, and he al so has a propert y in hi s rel igious opi nions.” B. For t he Founders, as we shal l see, t he prot ect ion of l ibert y itself m eant prot ect ion for propert y, and, i ndeed, property was so metim es said to be th e first o bject o f lib erty. III. Why were t he Founders so i ntent on prot ect ing propert y? A. Most of t he Founders bel ieved t hat propert y was at risk under t he Art icles of C onfederat ion, i n part because the Articles had left property under the contro l of state governm ents, each of which set its own trad e an d tariff p olicies, as well as co ined its o wn m oney. B. Just as i mport ant, the Founders bel ieved, al bei t for different reasons, t hat ownershi p of propert y was t he key to hum an autonom y and dignity—Jefferson even drafted a constitutional provision for the Virginia state Co nstitu tio n, wh ich wo uld have given property to ev ery wh ite m ale wh o didn’t alread y p ossess it. IV. The Court’s early cases on property illustrate both its im portance and the com plexity of the Founders’ views about the definition of property a nd its role in civic society. A. In the case of Calder v. Bull (1798), t he C ourt consi dered t he ori gins of propert y and t he ext ent of t he state’s authority to regulate it. In this case, th e C ourt proffered a som ewhat narrow vi ew of t he ex post facto clau se, lim itin g it to crim inal m atters an d, th us, m aking it so mewh at less u sefu l as a m ech anism fo r prot ect ing propert y. 1. In t he C ourt ’s judgm ent , the ex post facto guarant ee appl ies onl y to m atters of cri minal law and procedure. 2. Elsewhere i n the opi nions, vari ous just ices wax el oquent ly about the import ance and pri ority of property, with one justice going so far as to s uggest that under no conditi ons m ay the state take propert y from A and gi ve i t to B. B. In Fletcher v. Peck (1810), on the other hand, the Court advan ced a definition of property that m ade it nearl y immune from regul ation. In t he C ourt ’s vi ew, propert y was so i mport ant that it was prot ect ed from governm ental regulation either by the Constitution or by “the very nature of things.” 1. The si gni ficance of t his language shoul d not be underest imated. C hief Just ice M arshal l seem s to argue that p roperty m ust b e a p rotected value ev en ab sen t a sp ecific co nstitu tio nal p rovisio n sayin g so . 2. In a separate concurri ng opinion, Justice W illiam Johnson went ev en further, claim ing that not even God [“t he Dei ty”] can vi olate the ri ght to propert y. C. Just over a quart er cent ury later, however, t he C ourt , wri ting i n Charl es Ri ver Bri dge v. Warren Bri dge Company (1837), advanced a very di fferent underst andi ng of propert y. Here, t he C ourt stressed t hat the com muni ty has an i nterest in pri vate propert y and t hat pri vate ri ght s m ust som etimes gi ve way to communal in terests. 1. There are im portant differences between Fletcher v. Peck and Charl es Ri ver Bri dge . First, Marsh all n o longer led the Court. He had been replaced by Chief Justice Roger Ta ney, in his own right a towering fig ure in Am erican co nstitu tio nal h isto ry. Un lik e Marsh all, Tan ey was less in clin ed to fav or natio nal interests o ver state in terests an d less in clin ed to elev ate in dividual lib erties o ver th e p ublic welfare. 2. In t his case, Taney found for t he owners of t he second bri dge—or agai nst the propert y interest — wri ting: “The object and end of al l governm ent is to prom ote the happi ness and prosperi ty of t he ©2006 The Teaching Com pany Lim ited Partnership 18"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" com muni ty.

Tan ey’s o pinion rested ex plicitly o n how a p articu lar d efin itio n of property wo uld eith er in hibit o r prom ote econom ic growt h and expansi on i n the new count ry. 4.

New York and Economic Due Process Scope: As we saw in th e last lectu re, th e Co urt’s p rotecti on for pri vate propert y has waxed and waned. In t his lecture, we trace property through the 20 th century, from the great case of Munn v. Illinois (1877) and t he rise of econom ic due process i n the infam ous case of Lo chner v. New Yo rk (1905) t o the fal l of t hat doctrin e in West Co ast Ho tel v. Pa rrish (1937). W e shal l see t hat at its hei ght , econom ic due process envisio ned a Su prem e Co urt ag gressiv ely co mmitted to th e p rotectio n of property. Th is co mmitm ent was prem ised on a particular understanding of property and of the proper role of the Court in a constitutional dem ocracy. W hen the Court turned away from Lochner , it turned away from these l arger underst andi ngs as wel l. The reject ion of econom ic due process t hus si gnal ed t he end of aggressi ve judi cial scrut iny of st ate and federal econom ic act ivity in favor of an approach that reduces t he rol e of court s in overseei ng t he regul ation of propert y and, i nstead, ent rust s such m atters t o legislatures. Outline I. Charl es Ri ver Bri dge in itiated an era in wh ich th e Co urt was less p rotectiv e o f property rig hts an d, in stead , focused on t he com munal interest in regul ating t hose ri ght s. A. Th is d octrin e was ratified in Munn v. Illinois (1877), whi ch i nvol ved a l awsui t concerni ng t he Grangers and t he owners of grai n si los in the st ate of Il linoi s.

Th e Co urt ru led th at th e p ublic in terest in th is case o verro de th e p roperty in terest an d th at th e p roperty, to th e ex ten t th at it was d edicated to a p ublic p urpose, was consequent ly subject to publ ic regul ation. 2. In response, t he owners argued t hat the det erm ination of a “reasonabl e rat e” for st orage shoul d be settled by judges. The Court ruled that for “abuses” in the regulation of privat e property, the aggrieved part ies m ust seek resol ution i n the legislature, not in the court s. Furt her, “For prot ect ion agai nst abuses by legislatures, t he peopl e m ust resort to the pol ls.” 3. Elaborat ing on t he publ ic use cl aim, Chief Just ice W aite wrot e: “Propert y becom es cl othed wi th a public in terest wh en it is u sed in a m anner to m ake it o f public co nsequence.” 4. Just ice Fi eld wrot e an i mport ant, sharpl y worded di ssent : “Thi s deci sion i s subversi ve of pri vate propert y.” B. Munn galvanized com mercial interests to organize in opposition to state re gulation of private property and to prom ote, i nstead, t he doct rine of l aissez-fai re econom ics. 1. Lai ssez-f aire economi cs , as we shall see, refers to a concep tion of the m arketplace that leaves it free from m ost state regul ation. 2. The Am eri can B ar Associ ation was form ed wi th the purpose of get ting t he C ourt to overrul e Munn . II. In the infam ous case Lo chner v. New Yo rk (1905), the Court em braced laissez-faire, ruling, under a doctrine known now as economi c due process , that court s m ust prot ect pr operty against “m ere m eddlesom e interferences” by the state. A. Lochner is infam ous, at least in part, because the m ajority claim ed that it could find “no reasonable ground” for t he st ate law i n quest ion. 1. The l aw i n quest ion, based on the pol ice pow er , limited t he num ber of hours bakers coul d work i n com merci al bakeri es. The C ourt found t hat this law i nterfered wi th the em ployer’s and t he em ployees’ right to cont ract . 2. Just ice Peckham ’s opi nion for t he m ajori ty invoked a t ype of argum ent lawy ers l ike to cal l “the parade of horrib les”: If we p erm it th e state to reg ulate th e wo rking co nditio ns of bakers, th en it will b e allowed t o regul ate the worki ng condi tion of al most every occupat ion. 3. The m ajori ty furt her cl aimed t hat the law coul d not be just ified on any “reasonabl e” ground. 4. To m ost critics, the Court appears sim ply to s ubstitute its judgm ent about sound public policy for the legislature’s assessm ent. B. In th is sen se, Lochner seem s the opposi te of Munn : Here, we have a Court determ ined to correct “abuses,” instead of counsel ing t he aggri eved i nterest s to resort to the pol ls. ©2006 The Teaching Com pany Lim ited Partnership 20"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" C. In a wel l-known di ssent , Just ice Hol mes argued t hat the C ourt had no busi ness deci ding t he case on an econom ic theory that was not in the Constitution proper. Holm es also announced that the Constitution “is made for peopl e of fundam entally di fferi ng vi ews....” D. Lochner is infam ous, in other words, because it appear s that the Court acted, not on the basis of an identifiable constitutional principl e, but, instead, on its own opinion about the utility, desirability, or wisdom of t he law. 1.

Lochner is also im portant because it stakes out a vision of the relationship between the individual and the com muni ty, a vi sion t hat rem inds us of t he C ourt ’s posi tion i n such cases as Fletcher v.

Pa rrish (1937), t he C ourt reject ed Lochner and t he doct rine of econom ic due process, or t he doct rine that judges m ust take speci al care t o prot ect propert y right s. A. Chief Justice Hughes, writing for the m ajority, specifi cally noted that the liber ty protected by the due process clause is a “liberty in a soci al organi zat ion whi ch requi res t he prot ect ion of l aws agai nst the evi ls that m enace the health, safety, m orals, and welfare of the people.” B. In ad ditio n, th e Co urt n oted, “Ev en if th e wisd om of th e p olicy ... is d ebatab le ... still th e leg islatu re is entitled to its judgm ent.” IV. How do we expl ain t he di fference bet ween Lochner and West Co ast Ho tel ? Between the two cases is the Great Depressi on, and t he C ourt took up West Co ast Ho tel in the m idst of t he cont roversy of Presi dent Roosevel t’s Court -packi ng pl an. A.

For the Founders, and throughout m uch of Am eri can hi story , the tensi on bet ween t hese t wo val ues m anifest s itself m ost clearl y in the Suprem e Court’s property cases. As we shall see in the next few lectures, these issues are not lim ited to quest ions of propert y but , instead, ext end t o the m ost fundam ental quest ions of what it m eans t o be an indi vidual and what it m eans t o be a m ember of a l arger com muni ty. Shoul d t he com muni ty have a say in det erm ining what right s, i f any , a wom an has t oward the fetus she carries? Is the m oral sense of the com muni ty reason enough t o prohi bit cert ain sexual pract ices? Im plicit in these quest ions, and i n the m any others surroundi ng “pri vacy ,” are fundam ental not ions about what it m eans t o be a person and what right s are, as well as questions about the nature and lim its of judicial power in findi ng or creating constitutional right s. Outline I. In t his lect ure, we begi n our st udy of t he C ourt ’s com plicat ed pri vacy juri sprudence. A. We begin with th e Co urt’s earliest p rivacy cases, alm ost all o f wh ich co ncern rig hts to privacy in th e marriage rel ationshi p. B. We will then turn to the abortion and reproductive ri ghts cases, followed in turn, by a series of cases invol ving fam ily right s. C. Thereaft er, we t ake up cases i nvol ving sexual pri vacy and sam e-sex m arriages. D. We will co nclude with th e so -called “rig ht-to -die” cases, wh ich also ad dress p rivacy issu es. II. Although we say these cases i nvol ve t he ri ght to pri vacy , in som e way s, this statem ent is m isleadi ng. The Court ’s pri vacy cases cover a wi de vari ety of di fferent ki nds of i ssues and i nterest s. A. It m ight be m ore accurate to say that these cases are about autonom y, or hum an personality, or self- determ inatio n. B. Before we address speci fic cases, however, we shoul d underst and som e of t he broader concept s associ ated with th e rig ht to privacy m ore g enerally. C. The fi rst of t hese i ssues i s simply this: W hy shoul d we t urn from the propert y cases t o the pri vacy cases? 1. Thi s transi tion i s unconvent ional , but there are at least two good reasons for approachi ng t he m aterial in th is fash ion. a. First is a reason grounded i n hi stori cal conveni ence. The C ourt ’s earl iest pri vacy cases al most alway s invol ved a propert y interest as wel l. b. Second, property and privacy are sim ilar in that bot h ultim ately refer to larger questions about the nat ure of what it m eans t o be a person and what it m eans t o seek t he good l ife in com muni ty wi th others. 2. Like the right to property, cases involving the constitutional right to privacy and related interests raise import ant and com plex i ssues concerni ng t he boundari es bet ween l ibert y and com muni ty.

Th us, at a certain lev el o f ab stractio n, th e k inds of issu es we co nfro nted in th e p roperty lin e o f cases will occupy us with the privacy cases. E. There is, however, also an im portant diffe rence between the two lines of case law. 1. Un lik e p roperty, wh ich is clearly teth ered to th e co nstitu tio nal tex t, th e rig ht to privacy is p erhaps less obviously grounded in the Constitution. 2. There i s room for di sagreem ent here—m uch depends on how narrowl y or broadl y we read t he text or even what we choose to “include” in the definition of the Constitution. IV. There i s anot her i ssue we shoul d addre ss before we m ove t o speci fic cases. Earl ier in the course, i n Lect ure 2, we considered the case of Pal ko v. C onnect icut (1937). A. In Palko , the Court adopted the doctrine of selective incorporation, through which som e parts of the Bill of Rights becam e applicable to the states. 1. In particu lar, th ose p arts o f th e Bill o f Rig hts th at are “im plicit in th e co ncep t o f ordered lib erty” ap ply to the st ate governm ents. 2. At b otto m, Palko stan ds fo r th e claim th at so me parts o f th e Bill o f Rig hts are m ore im portan t th an others. Som e right s, t o use m ore cont em porary language, are “fundam ental,” and ot hers are not . 3. It is easy to criticize such claim s, but we need to fully understand them to appreciate the Court’s work in the field of privacy. B. When t he C ourt repudi ated Lochner , it d ecid ed th at th e test to use in assessin g th e co nstitu tio nality o f “econom ic” legislation, or policies that touch property, is the rationality te st. And as we saw, the definition of ratio nality is extrem ely elastic. C. No w co nnect th is test with th e d ecisio n in Palko . Palko tells u s th at th ere are two classes o f co nstitu tio nal right s—t he fundam ental and t he nonfundam ental. Prope rty is nonfundam ental and, hence, warrant s the ratio nality test. D. Fundam ental rights, however, receive m ore aggressive judicial scrutiny. When a right is fundam ental, such as privacy, as we shall see, the Court as ks: Is th e state’s in terest “co mpellin g”? 1. Not e how di fferent —how m uch m ore searchi ng—t his test, the comp ellin g sta te in terest test , is th an the sim ple ratio nality test. 2. Consider, for exam ple, a state that wants to prohibit abortions in a ll instances. It will not be enough for the state to ad vance a ratio nal set o f reaso ns fo r its d ecisio n. In stead , th e Co urt will req uire th e state to produce a com pelling reason. E. What ki nds of reasons are com pelling? 1. Can th e state ad vance a co mpellin g in terest in reg ulatin g th e sex ual activ ities o f sam e-sex partn ers? To answer t his, we m ust be abl e to art iculate the st ate’s i nterest s in a fai r am ount of det ail. 2. Woul d a st ate interest grounded i n expr essi ons of rel igious fai th be enough? 3. Woul d an i nterest grounded i n concern for publ ic heal th fare bet ter? 4. It is im portan t to rem ember th at states p ossess th e p olice p ower, trad itio nally d efin ed as th e p ower to protect the “health, safety, welf are, and m orals of society.” F. Consequently, it is often perfectly legitim ate for th e state to regulate indivi dual conduct on the basis of some larg er co mmunal in terest, an d so metim es, th at in terest ex ten ds to th e m oral sen sibilities o f th e community. G. But to say that an interest is legitim ate is not to say that it is, nece ssarily, com pelling. As we read the cases on privacy, th en, try to id entify p recisely wh at in tere st the state seeks to advance and what gravity we shoul d at tach t o that interest .

A. In hi s di ssent , Just ice B randei s argued for a m ore expansi ve concept ion of pri vacy , one l argel y free of propert y. B.

In 1890, Brandeis had written, with his law partner (S am uel D. W arren) in Boston, a fam ous article in the Harvard Law Review proposi ng t hat there shoul d be a ri ght to pri vacy . III. The Court did not act on Brandeis’s sugge stion until the 1960s. In the landm ark case of Griswo ld v.

No w, retu rning to Griswo ld , we see a fai r am ount of di sagreem ent wi thin the C ourt and a wi de vari ety of concurri ng and di ssent ing opi nions. A. In this case, Justice Douglas, writing for the m ajority, concluded that the Constitution does protect a privacy right of one kind or another. Again, I say of “one kind or another” b ecause the opinion is unclear about the preci se l ocat ion of t he ri ght and, i ndeed, uncl ear about the nat ure of t he ri ght . 1. In part icular, Dougl as decl ined t o find pri vacy in the Fourt h Am endm ent alone or i n any singl e constitutional provision. Instead, he found it in the “p enum bras and em anations ” of several different constitu tio nal p rovisio ns. 2. The ri ght to pri vacy , in ot her words, resul ts from the confl uence of a num ber of m ore speci fic constitu tio nal p rovisio ns. 3. In addition, Douglas wrote: “W e d eal with a right of privacy older th an the Bill of Rights. To allow the state to regul ate the sacred preci nct s of t he m arital bedroom woul d be repul sive t o the not ions of pri vacy surroundi ng t he m arital rel ationshi p.” B. Anot her uncert ainty concerns t he act ual di mensi on, or breadt h, of t he ri ght in Griswo ld . In som e places, the Court speaks about a broad ri ght to pri vacy , but in ot hers, i t seem s to focus on t he narrower cat egory of “m arital” p rivacy. C. Th e issu e was settled in th e su bsequent case o f Eisenst adt v. Bai rd (1972), i n whi ch t he C ourt concl uded that th e rig ht to privacy “m ust b e th e sam e for m arried and unm arried alike.” V. In an i nterest ing concurri ng opi nion, Just ice Gol dberg sought hel p in est ablishing t he pri vacy right from the Ninth Am endm ent . A. The Ninth, he argues, tells us that there m ust be im plicit constitutional right s beyond those specifically articu lated in th e Bill o f Rig hts. B. In response, Justice Black accused Goldberg of Lo chnerizing—of using the Ni nth as a way of sim ply reading into the Constitution protecti on of those rights that are im portant to judges or society, even though there is n o secu re co nstitu tio nal warran t fo r d oing so . VI. There are i mport ant di ssent s in Griswo ld . As t he di ssent s observed, t he C our t seem ed to create the right of privacy fro m th e scarcest o f co nstitu tio nal m aterials. A. As Justice Black wrote, “I like m y privacy as well as t he next one, but I am nevert hel ess com pelled t o adm it that the governm ent has a right to invade it unless prohibited by som e specific constitutional provi sion.” B. Justice Stewart v oiced an other im portan t criticism : Ab sen t an y clear co nstitu tio nal d irectiv e, th e Co urt’s “creation of the right to privacy represents an unwa rrant ed judi cial intrusi on i nto the powers of st ate legislatures.” VII.

Of course, dissents to Roe extend well beyond the courts, and we shall expl ore the social and political consequences of Roe , as well. Outline I. Roe invol ved a chal lenge t o a Texas st atute that prohi bited abort ion at any poi nt in a pregnancy except to save the life of t he m other. In 1970, Jane R oe (a pse udony m) was 25, unm arri ed, and pregnant . She fi led a class act ion lawsu it, ask ing th e co urt to declare th e statu te u nconstitu tio nal as a v iolatio n of her rig ht to privacy. A. The case m ight have been di sm issed on grounds of m oot ness or ri peness, t wo i mport ant doct rines desi gned to prom ote the prudent ial use of judi cial power. B. A com panion case, Doe v. Bolton , present ed a chal lenge t o a Georgi a st atute that requi red al l abort ions t o be approved by a “hospi tal abort ion com mittee.” II. In hi s opi nion for t he m ajori ty (7–2), Just ice B lackm un agreed t hat the ri ght to pri vacy , what ever i ts source, i s “broad enough t o encom pass a wom an’s deci sion whet her or not to term inate a pregnancy .” A. Note that Blackm un was not precise about where th e right to privacy is lo cated in the Constitution. B. Equal ly import ant, B lackm un offered no support at all for hi s concl usion—hardl y sel f-evi dent —t hat the right includes a deci sion t o term inate a pregnancy . He wrot e: “Thi s ri ght of pri vacy , whet her i t be found i n the Fourt eent h Am endm ent ’s concept of personal liberty, as we feel it is, or as the District Court det erm ined, i n the Ni nth Am endm ent ’s reservat ion of right s to the peopl e, i s broad enough t o encom pass a wom an’s deci sion whet her or not to term inate a pregnancy .” 1. This is an im portant point. It is not enough to establish, in this case, that the Constitution includes a rig ht to privacy, if it d oes. 2. The cri tical next step i s to show t hat such a ri ght includes t his part icular set of deci sions or conduct — and t he m ajori ty offers no support at all for t he concl usion t hat it does. III. Although t he C ourt concl uded t hat there i s a ri ght to pri vacy and t hat the ri ght is broad enough t o encom pass a deci sion t o term inate a pregnancy , the C ourt also denied the claim that su ch a right is absolute. A. Consequently, there are tim es when the state’s interests in regulating or prohibiting abortions will be strong enough t o overcom e the ri ght . B. Ori ginally, the st ate of Texas acknowl edged t hat one of t he reasons why the st ate prohi bited abort ion was to reinforce what it called a “Victo rian sense” of social m orality a bout proper sexual conduct; however, the state refused to articulate that or to press that as a reason before the Suprem e Court.

We cont inue our exam ination of t he consequences of Roe in th is lectu re b y ex ploring litig atio n after Roe . The most recent cases involving abortion and reproductive autonom y have highli ghted the issues of judicial power and accountability. As we saw last tim e, Roe di d not com pletely prohi bit the states from regulating abortion, and in the decade following Roe , the Court was called upon to determ ine the constitutionality of a great variety of such rest rictions. For exam ple, in Planned Parent hood of Mi ssouri v. Danf ort h (1976), t he Court struck down a st ate law requi ring m inors t o obt ain t he consent of t heir parent s and wi ves of t heir husbands before an ab ortio n. In m any of th ese cases, th e Co urt b egan to criticize th e lo gic o f Roe . Som e judges, not abl y Just ice Scal ia, al so cam pai gned for t he reversal of Roe . The Court considered a direct challen ge to Roe in the import ant and cont roversi al case of Planned Parent hood of Sout heast ern Pennsyl vani a v. C asey (1992), but the C ourt coul d not find a m ajori ty to overrul e Roe . Th e Co urt’s in tern al divisions continue to m anifest them selves, as we shall see wh en we take up the recent decision in Stenberg v. C arhart (2000), i n whi ch t he C ourt addressed Ne braska’s ban on part ial-birth abort ions. Outline I. Roe did not settle the debate over the C onstitution and abortion. Instead, it ina ugurated a debate that has lasted more t han 30 y ears and shows no si gn of di minishi ng. A. This is partly because the Court acknowledged in Roe that there is room for state regulation in the area of abort ions. The quest ions i nevi tably were redrawn to det erm ine whi ch st ate regul ations coul d pass constitu tio nal m uster an d wh ich were u nconstitu tio nal in frin gements o n a wo man’s co nstitu tio nal rig ht to privacy. Under the fram ework, a state m ay regulate an ab ortio n wh en it h as a co mpellin g in terest. B. In Planned Parent hood v. Danf ort h (1976), t he C ourt struck down a st ate regul ation t hat requi red m inors to obt ain t he consent of t heir parent s and wi ves t o obt ain t he consent of t heir husbands before an abort ion. C. In Planned Parent hood v. Ashcrof t (1983), the Court appeared to m odify its position by sustaining a parent al consent statute for “unem anci pated” m inors, provi ded t here was a provi sion t hat allowed som e minors al ternat ively to obt ain a judge’s approval . II. In Akron v. Akron C enter f or Reproduct ive Heat h (1983), t he C ourt reaffi rm ed i ts broad com mitment to Roe . In a st rongl y worded di ssent , Just ice O’C onnor argued t hat the “ Roe fram ewo rk ... is clearly o n a co llisio n co urse with itself....” A. What O’C onnor refers t o is a probl em concerni ng t he two “t imelines” we saw i n Roe. The fi rst timeline concerned fetal viability. That point was different in 1983 than in 1973, thus illustrating a larger problem : Advances in m edical technology m ean t that the point of viability would inevitability be pushed closer and closer t o the poi nt of concept ion. B. In cont rast , the second l ine—t he line concerni ng m aternal heal th—was al so undergoi ng change dri ven by medical technol ogy . Advances i n technol ogy m ade i t safer t o conduct abort ions l ater and l ater in the pregnancy . C. Th us, th e state’s ab ility to reg ulate a p regnancy was sim ultan eously b eing pushed back to th e m oment of concept ion and forward t o the m oment of bi rth. D. Six y ears l ater, C hief Just ice R ehnqui st advanced a si milar com plaint [in Webst er v. Reproduct ive Heal th Services ], not ing t hat the trimest er fram ework adopt ed i n Roe is “hardl y consi stent wi th the not ion of a Co nstitu tio n cast in general term s....” E. The Akron Court could m uster only a plura lity, but the opinion is im portant b ecause a plurality of j ustices seem ed prepared to rule, in contrast to Roe , that a st ate’s i nterest in pot ent ial life began not at the poi nt of viability b ut at th e p oint of co ncep tio n. 1. Scalia, who accused the Court of ac ting irresponsibly by not overruling Roe out right , not ed t he significance of the potential change. 2. Justice Black mun was eq ually d istressed , notin g th at a “ch ill win d blows. I d issen t.” ©2006 The Teaching Com pany Lim ited Partnership 33"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" III. Th e Co urt’s tu rm oil o ver Roe cont inued i n the si gni ficant case of Planned Parent hood v. C asey (1992). Agai n, the C ourt coul d not m uster a m ajori ty opi nion. A. Justice O’Connor wrote for a three- person plurality. She rejected the governm ent’s invitation to overrule Roe , instead explaining at great le ngth why the Court’s reliance on pr ecedent and concern for its own legitim acy counseled a reaffirm ation of Roe ’s cent ral hol ding. 1. O’C onnor began by not ing: Li bert y finds no refuge i n a juri sprudence of doubt . Aft er consi deri ng t he fundam ental quest ions resolved by Roe , p rincip les o f in stitu tio nal in teg rity an d th e ru le o f stare decisis , we are led to concl ude t his: The essent ial hol ding of Roe v. Wade shoul d be ret ained. 2. She cont inued: A deci sion t o overrul e Roe woul d address error, i f error t here was, at the cost of bot h profound and unnecessary d amage to th e Co urt’s leg itim acy an d to th e n atio n’s co mmitm ent to th e ru le o f law.” 3. In response, Just ice Scal ia sai d: I cannot agree wi th, indeed, I am appal led by , the C ourt ’s suggest ion t hat the deci sion whet her t o stand by an erroneous constituti onal decision m ust be strongly in fluenced—against overruling, no less—by the substantial and continuing pub lic opposition the decision has generated. 4. He cont inued: That is appal ling. The C ourt ’s deci sion, presum abl y, shoul d be governed by onl y one fact or, and that factor should be to get the Constitution right, and if getting it right m eans that we acknowledge that we got it wrong once before, then so be it, because our constitutional obligation is to th e Co nstitu tio n itself, n ot to our own co nstitu tio nal in teg rity.... Roe has created a national politics plagued by abortion pr otests, national abortion lobby ing, and abortion m arches on Congress. B. Although the plurality did not overrule Roe , it di d m ake pot ent ially subst antial changes i n the regul atory fram ework governi ng abort ions. 1. For exam ple, the plurality seem ed to eschew the fundam ental right/c om pelling state interest fram ewo rk in fav or of an im portan t or a su bstan tial lib erty in terest (a n ew categ ory o f lib erty) an d a rul e that perm its states t o regul ate abort ions at an y poi nt in a pregnancy , so l ong as such regul ations are not an “undue burden” on t he wom an’s ri ght . 2. One difficulty is that the plura lity did not define “undue burden.” C. Justice Blackm un, concurring in pa rt and dissenting in pa rt, praised the plurality opinion as an “act of perso nal co urage an d co nstitu tio nal p rincip le.” D. In co ntrast, Ju stice Scalia, d issen tin g, arg ued th at to praise th e p lurality o pinion as an act o f “statesm anship” was “n othing less th an Orwellian ”: “Th e issu e is wh eth er it [ab ortio n] is a lib erty protected by th e Co nstitu tio n of th e Un ited States. I am su re it is n ot.” IV. As a p ractical m atter, o ne co nsequence o f th e Co urt’s in ability to m uster a m ajority o pinion in Akron or, later, in Ca sey is a co ntin ued an d co ntentio us ro le fo r th e Co urt in overseein g th e p olitics o f ab ortio n. A. The new “undue burden” st andard, for exam ple, seem s to m any observers an open i nvi tation for st ates t o cont inue t o test out new regul ations on abort ion. B. One such recent case is Stenberg v. C arhart (2000), in which the Cour t declared unconstitutional Nebraska’s ban on part ial-birth abort ions. Once agai n, however, t he C ourt proved i tself deepl y di vided. The case produced no l ess t han ei ght separat e opi nions. 1. Justice Scalia wro te, “To day’s d ecisio n, th at th e Co nstitu tio n prevents th e p rohibitio n of a h orrib le mode of abortion, will be greeted by a fi restorm of controversy, as well it should.” 2. If Stenberg is a guide for future cases, then we should assum e, I think, that those future cases will show a C ourt as deepl y di vided as t his one. C. These are issues of politics, not necessarily or sim ply issues of law—and issues of politics are what it mean s to liv e in a co nstitu tio nal d emocracy. ©2006 The Teaching Com pany Lim ited Partnership 34"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" Essentia l Rea ding : Planned Parent hood of Mi ssouri v.

Th ere are, fo r ex am ple, inevitable and recurrent conflicts (despite our attem pts to ignore them ) between the values of liberty and equality. As Fel ix Frankfurt er once wrot e, t hese and ot her such confl icts are “what the Greeks t housands of y ears ago recogni zed as a t ragi c issue, nam ely the cl ash of ri ght s, not the cl ash of wrongs.” W e exam ine these cl ashes i n light of the broader philosophical and institutional problem s of th e constitutional order. I hope to show that constitutional “answers” to problem s like those of abortion, freedom of speech, and affirm ative action require a coherent understanding of the U.S. Constitution and of the assum ptions it m akes about hum an nature and the proper ends of governm ent and ci vil soci ety. We will, th erefo re, ex am ine th e d octrin al d evelopment o f sp ecific lib erties an d rig hts, su ch as d ue process an d privacy, the ultim ate denial of liberty entailed by the death penalty, freedom of speech and religion, and equal prot ect ion, but we shal l consi der t hem in a broader t heoret ical cont ext .

The course is divided into three s ections. W e begin with the institutiona l and interpretive foundations of the Am erican constitutional order. Our purpose here is to pr ovide students with background on the U.S. Suprem e Court and its ro le in th e co nstitu tio nal o rder, as well as an overview o f th e p rocess o f co nstitu tio nal in terp retatio n. In our first lect ure, for exam ple, we focus on t he organi zat ion, com posi tion, and deci sion-m aking aut hori ty of t he C ourt . In our second lecture, we take up the “why” and the “what” of constitutional interpretation. W e shall see that interpretation is both a choice and a necessity: a choice because we m ust choose am ong many diverse m ethods and strategies, and a burden because such choi ces are often difficult to justify or even to explain. In Lectures Three and Fo ur, we tak e up th e in tersectio n of Lectu res On e an d Two by co nsiderin g how an d wh y th e p ower o f co nstitu tio nal interp retatio n— and, hence, th e p ower to decid e th e m ost p ressin g issu es o f civ il lib erties—cam e to rest with th e Suprem e C ourt through t he m echani sm of judi cial revi ew. In the second section of the course, we begin our inquiry into the Bill of Right s. In every case that arises under the Bill of Rights, we m ust reconcile our desire for individual liberty with the need for public order, personal autonom y with th e n eed s o f th e co mmunity. Co nsidered in its to tality, an d not sim ply p rovisio n by provisio n, a b ill o f rig hts sketch es th e b road outlin es o f th e relatio nship between in dividual lib erty an d th e n eed s o f th e co mmunity. In th is larger sense, a bill of rights indicates how conflicts between liberty and co mmunity should be conceived and, to some ex ten t, reso lved. In our fifth lectu re, we co nsider th e h isto ry an d th eory o f th e Bill o f Rig hts. W as a b ill o f rights really necessary? And why, in itially, did its protections run only ag ainst the federal governm ent, not the states? In t he si xth l ect ure, we t ake up t he fasci nating doct rine of incorporatio n , or t he torturous and wi ndi ng road the Court followed to m ake the Bill of Rights applicable to state and lo cal governm ents—arguably a constitutional revol ution no l ess si gni ficant than t he Foundi ng i n Phi ladel phi a. In th e th ird an d, by far, th e larg est sectio n of th e course, com prising 30 l ect ures, we consi der t he indi vidual provisions of the Bill of Rights and the developm ent of several other specific lib erties.

A. In its plurality decision, the Court wrote that a governm ent action that “int rudes on choices concerning fam ily living arrangem ents” m ust be subject to careful scrut iny. B.

Lawrence (2003), t his time hol ding t hat “Li bert y presum es an aut onom y of sel f that includes ... cert ain intimate conduct .” The C ourt ’s deci sion i n Lawrence , lik e its earlier d ecisio n in Bowers , provoked cont roversy bot h on and off t he C ourt , cont roversy that once agai n revol ves around great q uestio ns of m orality an d judicial p ower. Outline I. In this lecture, we continue our exam ination of the constitutional right to privacy. Our cases involve an area of profound im portance and com plexity: hum an sexuality. A. Does the Constitution, perhaps through a right of priv acy, protect certain kinds of sexual behavior? If so, whi ch ones and why ? B. It is im portan t to rem ember h ere, as with th e o ther k inds of privacy cases we have considered, that there is alway s som e tensi on bet ween t he indi vidual right and the co mmunity’s in terests in reg ulatin g th ose rig hts. II. It is im portant to rem ember, too, that the issues in these cases are m ade even m ore com plicated because they also i nvol ve i mport ant issues about the limits of judi cial power. A. Such concerns arise in part because , again, the constitutional text has little if anything to say directly about such m atters. Consequently, constitutional interpreta tion has to struggle with fam iliar questions—about how broadl y or narrowl y to read t he text and about when, i f ever, i t is appropri ate for judges t o go bey ond the tex t itself. B. As we shall see, the Court’s work in this area has been especially sens itive to issues about judicial power and t he use of subst antive due process. III. All these issues cam e into pl ay in the im portant case of Bowers v. Hardwick (1986), i n whi ch t he C ourt first addressed so-cal led “unconven tional sexual pract ices.” In Bowers , th e Co urt ru led th at th e rig ht to privacy d oes not prohi bit states from m aking consensual sodom y be tween sam e-sex part ners a cri minal offense. A. Writing for t he C ourt , Just ice W hite concl uded, “There is no fundam ental right [of] hom osexual s to engage in sodom y.” 1. Justice W hite reasoned that the C ourt’s earlier privacy cases did not r each so far and that protection for hom osexual act ivity is “not deepl y root ed i n this nat ion’s hi story and t radi tions.” 2. In addi tion, Just ice W hite voi ced concerns about the limited rol e of court s in a dem ocracy . The C ourt should be reluctant “to expand the substantive reach of the Due Process Clause,” he wrote, because in doi ng so, “t he Judi ciary necessari ly takes t o itself furt her aut hori ty to govern t he count ry.” B. In an i mpassi oned di ssent , Just ice B lackm un descri bed t he pri vacy interest in very di fferent term s, argui ng that this case was l ess about sodom y than t he ri ght to be l et alone and sel f-det erm inat ion. C. Bowers is im portant in part because it dem onstrated ag ain that the Court has b een unable to develop a method or procedure for det erm ining what “pri vacy ” includes or excl udes. ©2006 The Teaching Com pany Lim ited Partnership 5"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" D. Bowers is im portant, too, because it dem onstrated that cases involving priv acy rights are profoundly influenced by how one charact eri zes t he interest s invol ved i n any speci fic case. These, i n turn, m ay be influenced by the C ourt ’s underst andi ng about the nat ure and l imits of i ts own power, as wel l as by larger visions about the rel ationshi p of t he indi vidual to soci ety. IV. Th e sam e issu es were still v ery m uch aliv e 1 7 years later, in Lawrence v. Texas (2003). A. In t his case, t he C ourt struck down a Texas l aw t hat prohi bited sodom y bet ween sam e-sex part ners. Unl ike the Georgi a law, however, t he Texas st atute di d not crim inalize the sam e acts when perform ed by het erosexual s. B. Writing for a 6 − 3 m ajori ty, Just ice Kennedy sai d, “Li bert y presum es an aut onom y of sel f that includes freedom of t hought , bel ief, expressi on, and cert ain intimate conduct .” 1. The m ajori ty thus concl uded t hat the descri ption i n Bowers of t he ri ght of pri vacy as a ri ght to sodom y had profoundl y m ischaract eri zed t he libert y interest in this case and t hat Bowers m ust, therefore, be overrul ed. 2. The m ajority opinion discussed at som e length when precedent shoul d control a decision and when it may be overrul ed. C. In a strongly worded dissent, Justi ce Scalia accused the m ajority of taki ng sides in a “culture war” that was better left to th e d emocratic p rocess an d th at th reaten ed a “m assi ve di srupt ion of t he current soci al order.” 1.

Responding to the m ajority’s discussion of precedent, Justice Scalia wrote: “I do not m yself believe in rigid adherence [to preceden t], but I do believe that we should be consistent rather than m anipulative in invoking [precedent].” V. Like so m any of t he C ourt ’s privacy cases, the decisions in Bowers and Lawrence provoked a st orm of bot h support and criticism in society at large. In that sense, Justice Scalia m ay well have been correct when he predi cted “m assi ve soci al di srupt ion.” Fol lowing Lawrence , for exam ple, som e m embers of C ongress have spoken openly about ways to discipline the Court.

As y ou know by now, t here i s a great deal of m aterial we m ust cover i n this course, and i n every lect ure are several cases and i ssues t hat dem and our at tention. Ev ery once i n awhi le, however, I t hink we woul d do wel l to narrow our focus by exam ining just one i ssu e and just a few cases in greater detail. A. In t his lect ure, t hen, I woul d l ike to take up a part icular pri vacy issue and consi der i t at lengt h: Does t he rig ht to privacy o ffer so me degree o f co nstitu tio nal p rotectio n fo r sam e-sex m arriag es? B. We sh all see th at th e U.S. Su prem e Co urt h as yet to ad dress th is q uestio n directly, b ut th ere are sev eral opi nions, bot h federal and st ate, t hat are rel evant to the quest ion. II. Agai n, no deci sion by the U.S. Suprem e C ourt di rect ly addresses this question, but there are a few cases that might bear on i t. A. For exam ple, in Loving v. Virginia (1967), t he C ourt rul ed t hat a Vi rgi nia statute that prohi bited i nterraci al marriages was a vi olation of t he fundam ental right to m arriage and of t he equal prot ect ion cl ause of t he Fourt eent h Am endm ent . 1. It is interesting that the Court identified two distinct constitutional grounds upon which the law could be i nval idated—t he fundam ental right to m arry and equal prot ect ion. 2. As we shal l see i n Lect ures Thi rty-Two t hrough Thi rty-Fi ve, t he equal prot ect ion argum ent can be made ent irely independent ly of t he fundam ental right s argum ent . B. In Romer v. Evans (1996), the Court invalidated an am endm ent to the Colorado Constitution that barred local governm ents from adopt ing ordi nances t hat prohi bited di scri minat ion agai nst hom osexual s. 1. Th e m ajority co ncluded th at th e am endment co uld not su rvive th e ratio nality test th at we ex plored in earlier lectures. 2. Al though Romer was deci ded on equal prot ect ion grounds, t here are aspect s of t he C ourt ’s m ajori ty opi nion t hat m ight be of rel evance t o the fundam ental right s quest ion as wel l. C. As we saw in Lecture Fourteen, in Lawrence v. Texas (2003), t he C ourt struck down a Texas l aw t hat prohi bited sodom y bet ween sam e-sex part ners. Unl ike the Georgi a law, however, t he Texas st atute di d not crim inalize the sam e acts when perform ed by het erosexual s. 1. Writing for a 6 − 3 m ajori ty, Just ice Kennedy sai d, “Li bert y presum es an aut onom y of sel f that includes freedom of t hought , bel ief, expressi on, and cert ain intimate conduct .” 2. One m ust wonder i f that sam e libert y includes t he ri ght to m arry the part ner of one’s choi ce. 3. Lawrence is also relevant because, at least in the opini on of m any observers, the Court seem ed to use a heightened fo rm of ratio nality, a so mewh at m ore ag gressiv e versio n of th e ratio nality test. ©2006 The Teaching Com pany Lim ited Partnership 7"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" 4. There was al so an i mport ant di ssent in Romer from Justice Scalia. He wrote: The Court has m istaken a Kulturkampf fo r a fit o f sp ite. Th e co nstitu tio nal am endment b efore u s here [he m eans the Colorado am endm ent] is not th e m anifestation of a “bare ... desire to harm ” hom osexual s, but is rat her a m odest attempt by seem ingl y tolerant Coloradoans t o preserve trad itio nal sex ual m ores ag ain st th e effo rts o f a p olitically p owerfu l m inority to rev ise th ose m ores through t he use of t he laws. D. In addi tion t o the foregoi ng cases, several states have adopt ed st atutes, som etimes cal led Defense of Marriage Acts, that typically define m arriage as an institution reserved to heterosexual couples. There is also a federal versi on, t he Defense of M arriage Act , or DOM A. III. Although t he C ourt has y et to say , this issue has been a m atter of except ional cont roversy since at least the earl y 1990s, when t he Suprem e C ourt of Hawai i rul ed t hat the st ate’s ban on such m arriages vi olated t he Hawai ian state co nstitu tio n. A. In the controversial case of Baehr v. Lewin (1993), the state Suprem e Court ruled that such prohibitions were a vi olation of t he equal prot ect ion cl ause. The c ourt in part rel ied on a U.S. Suprem e C ourt deci sion, Loving v. Virginia (1967), which had ruled that st ate prohibitions of interracial marriages violated the equal prot ect ion cl ause and t he fundam ental right to m arriage, prot ect ed under t he due process cl ause. In 1997, however, v oters in Hawaii p assed an am endment to th e state co nstitu tio n giving th e leg islatu re th e rig ht to lim it m arriag e to m ale-fem ale p artn ers. B. Six years later, in Baker v. Vermont (1999), t he Verm ont Suprem e C ourt rul ed t hat the Verm ont Co nstitu tio n req uires eq uality o f treatm ent between hetero sex ual an d sam e-sex m arriag es. Th e Verm ont legislature responded by passi ng a l aw offeri ng such coupl es “ci vil uni ons” wi th all the benefi ts that attach to m arriage, i ncludi ng t he ri ght to adopt chi ldren, t o own real est ate, and t o di spose of one’s est ate. C. In 2003, t he M assachuset ts Suprem e C ourt , in the cont roversi al case of Goodri dge v. Mass. Depart ment of Pu blic Hea lth (2003), ruled that a prohibition against sam e-sex m arriages violated both the fundam ental right to m arriage and the right to equa l protection under the state constitution. IV. The federal governm ent has al so t aken up t he issue of sam e-sex m arriages, not abl y wi th the passage of t he Defense of Marriage Act (1996), which prohibits federal r ecognition of sam e-sex m arriag es and allows states to refuse t o recogni ze such m arriages perform ed i n ot her st ates. A. Thirty-nine states have enacted sim ilar laws, but many have been challenge d on constitutional grounds. In particu lar, litig ants h ave claim ed th at su ch laws v iolate th e “fu ll faith an d cred it” p rovisio n of Article IV, Sect ion 1, whi ch general ly requi res st ate court s to honor judi cial rul ings and deci sions i n ot her st ates. B. Doubts about the constitutionality of DOMA and its counterparts in the states have led som e, including Presid ent Geo rge W . Bu sh, to call fo r a co nstitu tio nal am endment b arrin g sam e-sex m arriag es. V. No w, h aving rev iewed th e relev ant case law, let’s tu rn to a co nstitu tio nal an alysis o f sam e-sex m arriag e. A. Im agine that the Suprem e Court takes up such a case, and for purposes of analysis, im agine that the Court restricts its an alysis to th e p rivacy and subst antive due process i ssues. 1. Our fi rst inqui ry, probabl y, shoul d concern whet her such a ri ght exi sts and whet her i t is fundam ental. 2. We m ight use t he Palko test to ad dress th is q uestio n: Is th e rig ht to sam e-sex m arriag e “im plicit in th e concept of ordered l ibert y”? 3. Or we m ight use the test advanced by Justice Scalia : Is su ch a rig ht one th at is trad itio nally p rotected as a part of Am eri can hi story , or i s it root ed i n the nat ion’s hi story and t radi tion? 4. The answer, under ei ther t est, is not as obvi ous at it m ight first seem . 5. What is obvious, though, is that m any if not all of the justices w ill introduce another factor into the analysis—th at issu e, o f co urse, is wh eth er, in th e ab sen ce o f an y clear co nstitu tio nal g uidance, th e Court shoul d even undert ake t o resol ve the issue or, i nstead, shoul d l eave i t to the dem ocrat ic process to reso lve. ©2006 The Teaching Com pany Lim ited Partnership 8"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" B.

The issue has com e to the Court before, and each tim e, the Court has avoided com ing to a definitive decision about whether there is a constitutionally protected right to die or how far it m ight extend. A. In Cruzan v. Di rect or, Mi ssouri Dept . of Heal th (1990), t he C ourt consi dered t he case of Nancy Cruzan. 1. In t his case, Nancy Cruzan suffered a severe brai n i njury in a car crash i n January 1983. Al though she survi ved t he crash, her brai n was depri ved of oxy gen for at least 12 m inut es, and t he doct ors advi sed Cruzan’s parent s that she woul d never regai n cons ciousness. Her parent s approved t he insert ion of a feedi ng t ube t o keep her al ive. 2. In 1988, a st ate court grant ed C ruzan’s parent s perm issi on t o rem ove t he feedi ng t ube. The st ate appeal ed t o the M issouri Suprem e C ourt , whi ch revers ed the lower court. The Cruzans appealed to the U.S. Suprem e C ourt . B. In hi s opi nion for t he m ajori ty, C hief Just ice R ehnqui st assum ed but di d not deci de “t hat the Uni ted St ates Co nstitu tio n wo uld grant a co mpeten t p erso n a co nstitu tio nally p rotected rig ht to refu se lifesav ing hydrat ion and nut rition.” 1. Please not e that the C hief had not deci ded any thing about the part iculars of t his case just yet. ©2006 The Teaching Com pany Lim ited Partnership 10"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" 2. Inst ead, he had post ulated, for purposes of argum ent , that a com petent indi vidual m ight have a constitu tio nally p rotected rig ht to refu se certain kinds of lifesav ing treatm ents. C. In this case, however, Nancy Cruzan was in a vegetative state and, ther efore, not com petent. Hence, the question was whether the state of Missouri m ay re quire “clear and convinci ng evidence” of Nancy’s wish es b efore p erm ittin g her su rro gates—h er p aren ts—to m ake a d ecisio n fo r h er. D. The m ajori ty uphel d the evi dent iary requi rem ent, not ing t hat M issouri had t wo di stinct interest s it sought to prot ect . 1. First , M issouri had an i nterest in “the prot ect ion and preservat ion of hum an l ife, and t here can be no gainsayin g th is in terest.” 2. Second, M issouri had a “m ore part icular i nterest ” in prot ect ing “t he personal elem ent ” of t he profound choice b etween life an d death , an d “No t all in competen t p atien ts will h ave lo ved ones av ailab le to serve as surrogate decisionm akers.” E. In a sharply worded concurrence, Justice Scalia sounde d a fam iliar them e about the role of courts in such matters: “W hile I agree wi th the C ourt ’s anal ysis today ... I woul d have preferred t hat we announce, clearl y and prom ptly, that the federal court s have no busi ness i n this field....” F. In di ssent , Just ices B rennan, M arshal l, and B lackm un ar gued: “Nancy Cruzan has a fundam ental right to be free of unwant ed art ificial nut rition and hy drat ion,” and t he st ate’s i nterest s were not suffi cient ly strong t o overcom e that right . G. As y ou read t he vari ous opi nions i n the Cruzan case, I’d l ike y ou t o consi der t he fol lowing quest ion: W hat, preci sel y, is the poi nt of di sagreem ent bet ween t he m ajori ty and di ssent ing opi nions? 1. Both sets of opinions, I m ight s uggest, are willing to at least consid er the possibility of a fundam ental right . 2. And, t o a cert ain ext ent, there i s agreem ent about the sort s of i nterest s the st ate seeks t o address. 3. The disagreem ent, then, m ight be in how the vari ous opinions try to “balance” these diverse sets of interests. III. In 1996, just six y ears aft er Cruzan , two l ower federal court s ext ended t he logi c of t he case t o prohi bit states fro m en actin g laws th at p rohibited doctors fro m prescrib ing leth al d oses o f m edicatio n to term inally ill p atien ts who had request ed t he prescri ption. A. In one case, ari sing from W ashi ngt on St ate, t he court struck down t he law on t he ground t hat it vi olated a fundam ental right of pri vacy prot ect ed by the due process cl ause. In t he ot her, a federal court struck down a New York St ate law on equal prot ect ion grounds, fi ndi ng t hat the st ate coul d not di stingui sh bet ween a term inally ill p atien t’s rig ht to refu se treatm ent an d a rig ht to physician -assisted su icid e. B. In Vacco v. Quill (1997), t he U.S. Suprem e C ourt overrul ed t he equal prot ect ion case, fi ndi ng i nstead: “On their faces, neither New York’s ban on assisting suic ide nor its statutes perm itting patients to refuse medical treatm ent treat anyone diffe rent ly than any one el se or draw di stinctions bet ween persons.” C. In Washi ngt on v. Gl ucksberg (1997), t he C ourt wei ghed a l ibert y of “personal choi ce by a m entally competen t, term inally ill ad ult to co mmit p hysician -assisted su icid e” ag ain st “o ur Natio n’s h isto ry, leg al tradi tions, and pract ices.” 1. The C ourt concl uded t hat bans agai nst sui cide and assi sted sui cide are “l ongst andi ng expressi ons of the States’ co mmitm ent to th e p rotectio n an d preserv atio n of human life.” Un willin g to fin d a fundam ental right, the Court then we ighed the liberty against the stat e’s interest using the rationality test. The Court had little difficult in identifying a num ber of rational state inte rests that would support the ban. 2. On t he ot her hand, t he m ajori ty opi nion by Chief Just ice R ehnqui st di d suggest that the st rengt h of t he lib erty in terest m ight be differen t in other cases. As a co nsequence, th e issu e is n ot fin ally settled . 3. It is import ant, too, t o consi der som e aspect s of Just ice O’C onnor’s concurri ng opi nion, i n part because she raises a fam iliar concern about the role of courts in addressing these kinds of issues. She wro te: “Th ere is n o reaso n to th ink th at th e d emocratic p rocess will n ot strik e th e p roper b alan ce between th e in terests o f term inally-ill, co mpeten t in dividuals an d th e state’s in terest in protectin g th ose who m ight seek t o end l ife m istakenl y or under pressure.” ©2006 The Teaching Com pany Lim ited Partnership 11"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" 4.

In the past few lectures, we have explored issues under the rubric of a constitutional right to privacy or substan tiv e d ue process th at g o to th e h eart o f wh at it m ean s to be a h uman being an d to liv e in co mmunity with others. A. In so doi ng, we have opened up quest ions about the rel ationshi p bet ween sel f and soci ety. B. In t his lect ure, we consi der perhaps t he m ost profound versi on of t hose quest ions: the deat h penal ty. C. Am ong t he issues we m ust consi der are, fi rst , the m echani cs of t he deat h penal ty and, second, t he quest ion of who act ual ly get s the deat h penal ty, why , and how oft en. II. Is t he deat h penal ty a vi olation of t he Ei ght h Am endm ent ’s prohi bition of cruel and unusual puni shm ents? In this lectu re, we will see th at a m ajority o f th e Co urt h as n ever ru led th at it d oes v iolate th e Eig hth Am endment. On t he ot her hand, m ost of t he just ices have agreed wi th an observat ion by Just ice St ewart , who once wrot e, “deat h i s di fferent .” A. We take up the death penalty here because these cases , like the privacy cases we have just explored, raise troubl ing and awe-i nspi ring quest ions about the m eani ng of l ife, about the rel ationshi p bet ween t he indi vidual and soci ety, and about the proper l imits of judi cial power. B. And l ike the pri vacy cases, t he onl y enduri ng and st abl e feat ure of t he C ourt ’s work i n this area has been the persi stence and i ntensi ty of di sagreem ent , bot h wi thin the C ourt and i n soci ety m ore general ly. III. The current juri sprudence begi ns wi th the C ourt ’s deci sion i n Furman v. Georgi a in 1972. A. A sharpl y di vided C ourt concl uded t hat Georgi a’s deat h penal ty sy stem di d vi olate the Ei ght h Am endm ent but coul d not agree why . Every m ember of t he C ourt issued an opi nion. B. Two justices—Bren nan an d Marsh all—co ncluded th at th e d eath penalty is b y defin itio n unconstitu tio nal. C. Three ot her just ices—Dougl as, W hite, and St ew art — concl uded t hat the Georgi a schem e was unconstitutional because it gave the sentencing authority (in this case, the j ury) too m uch discretion. D. Just ice St ewart wrot e: “The penal ty of deat h di ffers from all ot her form s of cri minal puni shm ent, not in degree, but in ki nd. It is uni que i n its absol ute renunci ation of al l that is em bodi ed i n our concept of hum ani ty.” ©2006 The Teaching Com pany Lim ited Partnership 13"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" E. In a separate opinion, Chief Jus tice Burger sounded a them e that should be fam iliar: “Since there is no majori ty of t he C ourt , the fut ure of capi tal puni shm ent in this count ry is in limbo. If t oday ’s opi nions dem onst rate not hing el se, t hey starkl y show t hat this is an area where legislatures can act far m ore effectively than Courts.” F. The ot her four just ices di ssent ed. G. Fo llo win g Furman , well over 30 states adopted ne w death penalty laws. The inability of the Court to find a majori ty voi ce for i ts m ajori ty judgm ent in Furman m eant that, as a practical m atter, the lower federal and state courts were left without an y clear guidance about when the d eath penalty m ight pass constitutional mu ster. IV. In Gregg v. Georgi a (1976), t he C ourt agai n consi dered t he deat h penal ty, and agai n i t coul d not find a m ajori ty voice. W ritin g fo r a p lurality, Ju stice Stewart co ncluded th at m andatory d eath sch emes wo uld be unconstitutional. He went on to lim it a state’s ability to im pose death by im posing a num ber of conditions on the process, i ncludi ng a suggest ion t hat the C ourt ’s concerns m ight be al leviated i f states adopt ed “a bi furcat ed proceeding.” A. Just ice St ewart also not ed t hat opponent s of t he deat h penal ty m ust bear “a heavy burden” i n attacki ng t he “judgm ent of t he represent atives of t he peopl e.” B. Nevert hel ess, t he C ourt di d at tach a num ber of condi tions t o the deat h penal ty. The best known of t hese i s the requi rem ent of bifurcated proceedings , whi ch m eans onl y that there m ust be separat e heari ngs t o determ ine g uilt an d sen tencin g. C. In an i mpassi oned di ssent , Just ice B rennan chal lenged t he m ajori ty’s deference t o the peopl e, not ing, “Thi s Co urt in escap ably h as th e d uty, as th e u ltim ate arb iter o f th e m ean ing of th e Co nstitu tio n, to say wh eth er ‘m oral concept s’ requi re us t o hol d t hat the deat h penal ty is cruel and unusual .” D. Gregg , lik e Furman before it, initiated another round of st ate experim entation with death penalty procedures. V. Who get s the deat h penal ty? As far back as Furman , som e just ices had argued t hat the deat h penal ty is raci ally biased. A. In 2002, t here were just over 300 persons on deat h ro w i n the Uni ted St ates. M ore t han 98% were m ale, 56% were whi te, 35% were bl ack, 7% were Hi spani c, and 2% were of ot her raci al backgrounds. W hat, if anything, do these num bers tells us about race and the death penalty? B. In McCleskey v. Kemp (1987), the Court considered an academ ic study that had conc luded that African- Am ericans who m urdered white victim s were substantia lly m ore likely to receive the death penalty than whites who m urdered blacks. 1. The Court concluded that “at m ost ... the evidence presented indicates a discrepancy that appears to correlate with race. Apparent disp arities in sentencing are an inevitabl e part of our crim inal j ustice system .” 2. Moreover, Justice Powell sounded fam iliar them es about the reach of judicial power, noting that such “argum ent s are best present ed t o the legislative bodi es.” VI. What is the state of d eat h penal ty juri sprudence? McCleskey suggest s a C ourt that stresses deference t o the dem ocrat ic process. A. On th e o ther h and, in two other cases, th e Co urt ap peared m ore willin g to open th e su bstan tiv e issu es invol ved i n som e ki nds of deat h penal ty cases. 1. In Atkins v. Virginia (2002), t he C ourt concl uded t hat states m ay not execut e indi vidual s found t o be mentally retard ed. 2. In Roper v. Si mmons (2005), t he C ourt rul ed t hat the deat h penal ty m ay not be appl ied t o m inors under the age of 18. 3. In Herrera v. Co llin s (1993), the Court considered a claim of “actual innocence,” or a claim by a pri soner, i n ot her words, t hat he coul d proffer real evi dence of hi s act ual innocence. ©2006 The Teaching Com pany Lim ited Partnership 14"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" 4. In reject ing t he cl aim, the C ourt concl uded, “A pri soner’s cl aim of act ual innocence st andi ng al one i s not sufficient grounds for relief, becau se federal courts do not sit to co rrect factual errors. They sit to correct co nstitu tio nal v iolatio ns.” B. What are we to m ake of the death penalty if, as seem s likely, we som etim es execute individuals who are, in fact , innocent ? Consi der t wo addi tional quot es: 1. The fi rst is an opi nion by Just ice B lackm un i n Ca llin s v. Co llin s (1994): From this day forward, I no l onger shal l tinker wi th the m achi nery of deat h.

The second i s a response, i n the sam e case, from Just ice Scal ia: “B lackm un’s opi nion,” he wrot e, “often refers to in tellectu al, m oral, an d perso nal p ercept ions, but never t o the text and t radi tion of t he Constitution. It is the latter rather than the form er that ought to control.” C. Finally, we should note that in m any of the Court’s m ost recent deat h penalty cases, the justices have begun to argue about when, if ever, our Court shoul d draw on the constitutional jurisprudence of other count ries. 1. Just ice B reyer, for exam ple, has seem ed open t o such i nqui ries. 2.

In t his lect ure, we consi der what the Founders m ay have m eant when they sought to prot ect speech and the equally im portant question of wh y th ey sought to protect speech. A.

In deed , o ne asp ect o r an other o f th e First Am endment will b e th e fo cus o f our atten tio n fo r the next 11 lectures, and even then, we can only hope to scratch the surface. B. What if the historical record c ould show us what the Founders m eant by freedom of speech? Is it so clear in th e 2 1 st cent ury that we shoul d rest rict the m eani ng of t he Fi rst Am endm ent to an 18 th -century underst andi ng? C. As we have seen in nearly ever y lecture, the Constitution’s m eaning has changed over tim e, and with each change, the am endm ent—or, rather, its jurispruden ce—seem s to have becom e ever m ore com plicated. 1. There are m any reasons for this com plexity, including the centrality of freedom of speech and religion to co nstitu tio nal d emocracy, as well as th e Co nstitu tio n’s relativ e silen ce o n m atters p ertain ing to speech. 2. As we have seen in earlier lectures, too, cases and conflicts concerning freedom of speech raise im portant and intractable issues about the nature of constitutional interpretation and the lim its of judicial authority. II. Why did the Founders single out speech and religion for special protection? There is no single answer to this quest ion. A. Som e of t he just ificat ions advanced, bot h by the F ounders and by court s charged wi th m aking sense of t he First Am endment, in clu de: 1. The cl ose rel ationshi p bet ween t he free exchange of i deas and dem ocrat ic sel f-governance. 2.

We should take up each of the foregoing justifi cations for freedom of speech in m ore detail. A. The fi rst argum ent is prem ised on t he dem ands of sel f-governm ent. 1. The cl aim, whi ch m ight seem obvi ous, i s that represent ative dem ocracy woul d not be possi ble wi thout the free exchange of ideas. This fr ee exchange is partly about the ability of citizens to debate the merits of vari ous publ ic pol icies and m atters of publ ic import . 2. Bu t it is also critical to th e fr ee exchange of inform ation between citizens and their representatives. 3. It is im portant to note that this defense of speech —like all of the others we shall consider—does not extend, necessarily, to all form s of speech and expre ssion. W e m ight say, on this defense, that it is only “political” speech (however we de fine it) that m ust be protected. 4. Consider a brief exam ple—the case of Moore v. City of East Cleveland (1977) t hat we t ook up i n the privacy lectures. It was clear that the case raised fa mily/p riv acy issu es, b ut it also raised issu es th at might fal l under t he rubri c of freedom of associ ation. 5. One justice, Justice Stewart, ar gued preci sel y this and went on t o not e that freedom of associ ation should extend only to associations that are political in nature. 6. Of course, the obvious response to this line of argum ent is to open the question of definition. Is it clear that th e fam ily is n ot political? B. The second argum ent for freedom of expression rest s on its centrality to hum an personality and self- devel opm ent . 1. Th e id ea h ere is th at th e d evelopment an d flo urish ing of th e h uman perso nality m ust m ean th at we are free t o hol d a wi de array of i deas and bel iefs, t hat we m ust b e ab le to try th em on, even if they are noxi ous t o ot hers. 2. If t here are i deas we m ay not hol d or express, t hen there m ay be som e avenues for self-developm ent that are closed. C. A t hird argum ent for freedom of expressi on i s the argum ent from truth. 1. Many form s of this defense trace their origin to John Stuart Mill’s On Liberty (1859). It rest s on t he assum ption that truth is m ost likely to em erge from a free m arketplace of ideas. The antidote for bad speech, it is thus said, is m ore speech. 2. There are, of course, a num ber of i nterest ing quest ions t hat fol low from this approach, such as: W hat do we do i f we fi nd t ruth? D. There are a num ber of ot her defenses of freedom of expression that we shall see in the following lectures. 1. On e is so metim es called th e checking theory , or the idea that speech is a check against governm ental power or bad speech. 2. A second i s the so-cal led safety va lve th eory , which rests on the claim that freedom of speech acts as a safet y val ve for what m ight ot herwi se be vi olent act ion agai nst the st ate or ot her persons. IV. Of all these different justifications for free dom of expression, which did the Founders em brace? A. The answer is that they em braced all of them , in various degr ees and in various com binations. B. It is im portan t to rem ember, wh en we tak e up sp ecifi c issues and cases, that, for the m ost part, we have very little evidence of what the Founders intended. V. It is worth noting, too, that th e First Am endm ent prohibits only laws curtailing freedom of speech, not speech itself. A.

For the sake of what values or interests would governm ent be justified in lim iting speech?

Are there tim es when we m ight not want to prot ect it? When is the nation entitled to protect its elf against speech that advocates illegal act ion or, arguabl y, endangers t he securi ty of t he Uni ted States? As we shall see in this lecture, the United States has wrest led wi th this quest ion from its incept ion, begi nni ng wi th the Al ien and Sedi tion Act of 1798, through the Espionage Act of 1917, and m ost recen tly, in the USA Patriot Act. W e begin with the wel l-known case of Schenck v. Uni ted St ates (1919), i n whi ch t he C ourt penned t he fam ous “cl ear and present danger” t est. Over t he y ears, t he test has undergone vari ous form ulations, from the “bad t endency ” test in Gitlo w v. New Yo rk (1925) t o the “i nci tement” test elaborat ed i n Brandenburg v. Ohi o (1969), but in all of t hem , the underl ying i ssues have been t he sam e: How deep does our com mitment to freedom of speech run, and who should balance the com peting dem ands of the First Am endm ent and national security? Outline I. As we saw in the last lecture, the reasons we protect speech are com plex. Are ther e tim es when we m ight not want to prot ect it? When is the nation entitled to protect itself ag ainst speech that advocates illegal action or, arguabl y, endangers t he securi ty of t he Uni ted St ates? Are there tim es when, the First Am endm ent notwithstanding, we should not protect any and all form s of speech? Th is question has pla gued the nation since the Foundi ng. A. Som e schol ars, for exam ple, have argued t hat the Founders i ntended t o prohi bit the pri or censorshi p of t he press but perhaps not seditious libel or a written co mmunication critical of the governm ent or the state. B. The Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 illustrate the l ongstanding tendency of the state to seek to stifle criticism , as well as th e in ten se co ntroversy an d back lash th at su ch effo rts typ ically g enerate. II. The C ourt ’s consi derat ion of such i ssues st art s wi th the import ant deci sion i n Schenck v. Uni ted St ates (1919). A. In Schenck , the Court upheld the Espionage Act of 1917, whic h m ade it illegal for individuals, in this case, to distrib ute p amphlets th at en couraged resistan ce to m ilitary p roscrip tio n. B. Som etim es the Court insists that there are different kinds of speech , and som e kinds are of greater constitu tio nal weig ht. 1. The Court has often suggested, for exam ple, that political speech goes to very core of the First Am endm ent and, t hus, warrant s great prot ect ion. 2. If that is true, then consider the kind of speech at issue in this case: Schenck is protesting perhaps the most political of actions—war—and m aking an argum ent based upon the Constitution itself. C. Schenck is critical to the developm ent of First Am endm ent doctrine because it introduced the well-known “clear and present danger” test. Holm es wrote: The charact er of every act depends upon t he ci rcum stances i n whi ch i t is done. The quest ion i n every case is whether the words are used in such circum stances and are of su ch a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will br ing about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent. It is a quest ion of proxi mity and degree. D. It is worth noting that the clear and present danger test is not necessa rily a standard that protects speech; instead , th e test is larg ely co ntentless. 1. In Schenck , for exam ple, t he defendant s were convi cted si mply for di stribut ing pam phl ets—i t is difficu lt to im agine th at th ere was m uch of a su bstan tial th reat to proscrip tio n in particu lar o r to th e war effort in general. 2. Th e critical q uestio n, th en, is less th e test th an wh o gets to ap ply it. ©2006 The Teaching Com pany Lim ited Partnership 19"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" III. In later cases, the Court continued to reform ulate the cl ear and present danger test, som etim es in ways that were more protective of speech and, at other tim es, more sym pathetic to gove rnm ental regulation. A. In Gitlo w v. New Yo rk (1925), t he C ourt rel axed t he test, transform ing i t into the so-cal led “bad t endency ” test. Th e Co urt su stain ed th e ap plicatio n of a New Yo rk crim inal an arch y law to political strik es. 1. In so doing, the Court sim ply accepted the judgm ent of the New York legislature that certain words, in and of t hem sel ves, t ended t o present a danger. The C ourt wrot e: “A si ngl e revol utionary spark m ay kindl e a fi re t hat, sm olderi ng for a t ime, m ay burst into a sweepi ng and dest ruct ive confl agrat ion.” 2. In an i mport ant di ssent , Just ices Hol mes and B randei s argued t hat the cl ear and present danger t est requi red an act ual and im mediate threat. B. In Wh itn ey v. Ca lifo rnia (1927), Justice Brandeis, writing for the Court, argued in contrast to Gitlo w : “Th e fact that speech is likely to result in som e violence is not enough to justify its suppression. There m ust be the p robability o f serio us in jury to th e State.” [ Supplementary note : On th e o ther h and, in th e m idst o f th e Co ld W ar, th e Co urt seem ed to reassu me th e deferent ial post ure i t had adopt ed i n Gitlo w . In Denni s v. Uni ted St ates (1951), for exam ple, t he C ourt ruled that the First Am endm ent does not m ake the governm ent helpless “in the face of preparation for revol ution,” no m atter how far off i t m ight be.] C. Fin ally, in Brandenburg v. Ohi o (1969), t he C ourt , fol lowing suggest ions i n Yat es v. Uni ted St ates (1957) and Noto v. Uni ted St ates (1961), reform ulated t he cl ear and present danger t est once agai n. In i ts current form ula, the test prohibits the suppression of speech “ex cept where such advocacy is directed to inciting or produci ng i mminent lawless act ion and i s likely to incite or produce such act ion.” IV. Although the decision seem s m ore protective of sp eech than som e of the Court’s earlier efforts, Brandenburg is not without its own difficulties. A. Such term s as advocacy , incitemen t , and likely to in cite are suffi cient ly vague t o requi re i nterpret ation, and judges m ay vary on how m uch em phasi s they gi ve t o one part of t he test or anot her. B. The illegal advocacy cases, therefore, raise the perennial issues of when the state m ay act to protect itself and how far it m ay g o in restrictin g civ il lib erty in th e p ursuit o f secu rity. C. These i ssues di d not di e wi th the end of t he C old War. Instead, they are the heart of current confl icts surroundi ng part s of t he USA Pat riot Act and t he war on t errori sm . V. The illegal advocacy cases raise fam iliar issues about how to weigh com peting interests in constitutional cases and about when judges shoul d defer to m ajoritarian judgm ents. Th ese issues extend well beyond the illegal advocacy cases. A. Co nsider a h ypothetical set o f issu es: W hat if a p olitical p arty ch allen ged th e v ery leg itim acy o f th e governm ent of t he Uni ted St ates? B. In other wo rds, im agine a p olitical p arty co mmitted to th e d estru ctio n of rep resen tativ e d emocracy in th e Uni ted St ates but one t hat denunci ates vi olence. C. Can we prohibit such speech—unquestionably political in content—without r unning afoul of the First Am endm ent ? D.

S hould those reasons also influence how we defi ne speech ? In t he next four l ect ures, we t ake up t horny quest ions about the m eani ng of speech and expression, about what we m ight include in the am bit of the First Am endm ent, and what we might choose to leave unprotected because it is not “really” speech. The C ourt has l ong recogni zed t hat the distinction between conduct and cont ent can be elusive, particular ly when “speech” and “nonspeech” elem ent s uni te in a si ngl e course of act ion. Any act ion, such as burni ng a draft card or a fl ag, or hangi ng an effi gy, or weari ng an arm band, m ight be m otivated by an expressi ve purpose. In t his lect ure, we consi der how the Court has handled sym bolic speech and expressive conduct. In Uni ted St ates v. O’Bri en (1968), the C ourt devel oped a four-part test for det erm ining t he val idity of governm ental act ions t hat regul ate expressive conduct. As we shall see, however, the test is not always easy to apply and does little to help us underst and t he m ost vexi ng of i ssues: W hat is speech , what is conduct , and what is the difference? Outline I. In our last lecture, we saw that the Schenck/ Brandenburg line of cases is very com plicated doctrin ally. Bu t at no point did anyone argue that the cases did not involve sp eech at all. In other words, in Schenck , Brandenburg , Gitlo w , Denni s , Yates , and that entire line of inte rnal or illegal advocacy cases, we all agreed, without even really having to ask, that there was actually speech involved in those cases. A. In the next four lectures, however , we take up thorny and difficult questions about th e very definitions of speech and expression , or about what we m ight want to include i n the am bit of t he Fi rst Am endm ent and what we m ight choose to leave unprotected because it is not “rea lly” speech, whatever speech m eans. B. The C ourt has l ong recogni zed, as we shal l see i n this lect ure, t hat there i s a di stinction bet ween conduct and content, and that that distinc tion can be elusive, particularly wh en there are “speech” and “nonspeech” elem ents that unite in a single course of action. II. Man y defin itio nal issu es h aunt th e First Am endment. Perh aps th e m ost in tractab le o f th ese d efin itio nal issu es is misleadi ngl y strai ght forward: W hat is speech ? Th is is a to pic th at will o ccu py us fo r sev eral lectu res. A. In th is lectu re, we co nsider th e q uestio n in its m ost b asic sen se: Is th ere a d ifferen ce, co nstitu tio nally, between speech and conduct? B. The Court has long held that som e things that seem plainly to be speech, such as obscenity, are som etim es not prot ect ed. On t he ot her hand, som e things t hat m ight seem to be conduct , such as sl eepi ng i n a park, might be expressi ve and, t hus, prot ect ed. C. And there are the cases in which the distinction i s bl urred—such as weari ng an arm band t o prot est a war or carrying a placard in a union strike. In these cases, the conduct, or activity, seem s m otivated by an expressi ve purpose. III. The C ourt has creat ed a com plicat ed set of t ests to govern t he area of symbolic speech or expressi ve conduct . In the leading case of Uni ted St ates v. O’Bri en (1968), t he C ourt devel oped a four-part test for revi ewi ng t he constitutionality of legislation regulating expre ssive conduct. A. O’Brien invol ved a person who had burned hi s draft regi strat ion card i n a publ ic prot est agai nst the Vietnam W ar. A federal statute m ade it a crim e to destroy a draft card. B. Accordi ng t o the C ourt , the st atute at issue was cont ent neut ral . Its pri mary purpose, i n ot her words, was t o protect the integrity of the regist ration system , not to suppress speech . The Court tries to distinguish between cont ent -based and cont ent -neut ral rest rictions on conduct . C. Because the legislation was content ne utral, the Court did not subject it to strict scrutiny. Instead, the Court offered a m ulti-pronged test. A cont ent-neutral law is constitutional: 1. If it is o therwise j ustifiab le as with in th e leg itim ate p owers o f th e state. 2. If i t furt hers an i mport ant governm ental interest . ©2006 The Teaching Com pany Lim ited Partnership 22"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" 3. If that interest is unrelated to the suppression of speech and if the in cidental restric tion on speech is no greater than necessary to further that interest. D. The basi c test, then, i s this: If a governm ental act ion regul ating conduct is intended t o suppress t he message, the restriction m ust be subjected to strict scrutiny. 1. There are difficulties with this test. The m ost obvious is that it is often difficult to determ ine legislative intent or purpose. 2. Anot her di fficul ty is defi nitional : How can we know whet her t he act ivity or behavi or i s expressi ve? 3. The Court addressed this question at least in part, noting: “W e cannot accept the view that an apparently lim itless variety of conduct can be labe led ‘speech’ whenever the person engaging in the conduct intends t hereby to express an i dea.” E. Th ere is an other d ifficu lty with O’Brien . The C ourt rul ed t hat the governm ent’s st ated purpose i n maintaining the integrity of the dr aft system was sufficiently im portant to overcom e the speech interest. The C ourt also hi nts that a part of i ts concl usion rest s on t he idea t hat there were ot her m ethods of com munication open to the plaintiff. The Court will begin to build on that suggestion in later cases. F. Fin ally, the O’Brien Court shoul d rem ind us of t he doct rine of com ity. Co mity is th e p rincip le th at o ne branch of governm ent owes t he ot her branches a great deal of respect . How i s it invol ved i n O’Brien ? 1. The governm ent stated that it had no hostility to O’Br ien or his m essage. Com ity holds that the Court must respect this claim , absent any di rect evidence that would contravene it. 2. Why is com ity import ant? The pri nciple is grounded i n larger consi derat ions of separat ion of powers. IV. The O’Brien test is not always easy to apply. More troubl esom e, however, is that it does little to help us underst and t he m ost vexi ng of i ssues: W hat is speech , what is conduct , and what is the difference? The Court’s consi derat ion of subsequent cases m ay hel p us t o get a handl e on t he di stinction. A. In Tinker v. Des Moines (1969), t he C ourt consi dered a case i n whi ch several student s at a publ ic school were suspended for weari ng bl ack arm bands t o oppose t he war i n Vi etnam . B. In his opinion for the Court, Justice Fortas described this conduct as “akin to pure speech.” C. Consequent ly, “In order for t he St ate to just ify the prohi bition of a part icular expressi on of opi nion, i t m ust be ab le to sh ow th at its actio n was cau sed by so mething m ore t han a m ere desi re t o avoi d t he di scom fort and unpleasantness that always accom pany an unpopular viewpoint.” D. Fort as concl uded by not ing, “In our sy stem , st ate-operat ed school s m ay not be enclaves of to talitarian ism .” E. The case generat ed an i mpassi oned di ssent by Just ice B lack, who wrot e: “Assum ing t he C ourt is correct in holding that the conduct of wearing arm bands for the purpose of conveying political ideas is protected by the First Am endm ent, the crucial rem aining questi ons are whether students and teachers m ay use the schools at their whim , as a platform for the exercise of free speech.” F. Tinker suggests a wide range of First Am endm ent free dom s for students in public schools, but, in recent years, t he C ourt has been m ore sy mpathet ic to the cl aims of school offi cials who argue t hat limits on expressi on are necessary to m aintain school di sci pline and t he integri ty of t he curri cul um. V. Two years later, in Co hen v.

Writing for the Court, Justice Harlan ruled that the convic tion violated Cohen’s fr eedom of speech, noting, “It is, nevert hel ess, oft en t rue t hat one m an’s vul gari ty is another’s ly ric. In fact , words are often chosen as much fo r th eir em otiv e as th eir co gnitiv e fo rce.” 1. Recal l our di scussi on of O’Brien .

For exam ple, in Lecture Nineteen, we e xplored the so-called internal secu rity or subversive speech cases, and in Lecture Twenty, we took up the pr oblem s of sym bolic speech and expr essive conduct. In both areas, as we saw, t he C ourt has const ruct ed a com plicat ed juri sprudence, a jurisprudence that centers on a variety of doctrinal tests, such as the clear and present danger doct rine or t he four-part O’Brien test for regulating sym bolic speech. And im plicit in both areas of inqui ry was also a problem of definition: W hat is speech ? What isn ’t? We will follow the sam e course in this lecture, where we ask: Is pornography speech? This is, in m any way s, al so a quest ion of defi nition. And t he C ourt ’s effort s to provi de such a defi nition have si milarly resu lted in a set o f doctrin al tests th at we will n eed to co nsider. In Miller v. Ca lifo rnia (1973), t he C ourt provided som e support for the effort s of state and local governm ents “to m aintain a decent society,” developing a three-part test desi gned to distinguish between protect ed speech and the “crass com mercial expl oitation of sex.” Si nce Miller , the C ourt has cont inued t o struggl e, however, wi th the probl em of definition. As we shall see, too, the Court’s recent efforts to define pornography and indecency have been furt her com plicat ed by the rapi d advance of t echnol ogy . Thus, i n Ren o v. America n Civil Lib erties Un ion (1997), the Court found unconstitutional two key provisi ons of the Com munications Decency Act of 1996 designed to prevent m inors from indecent and paten tly offensive com munications on the Internet. In Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition (2002), t he C ourt struck down a part of t he C hild Pornography Protection Act that regulated “virtu al child pornography.” Finally, we w ill conclude by returning to the quest ion t hat undergi rds every Fi rst Am endm ent case: W hat do we do i f the val ues t hat inform the Fi rst Am endment co nflict with other v alues, su ch as eq uality o r human dignity? Outline I. The C ourt ’s m odern obsceni ty juri sprudence begi ns wi th Rot h v. Uni ted St ates (1957), i n whi ch t he C ourt reaffi rm ed t he rul e that obsceni ty is unprot ect ed by the Fi rst Am endm ent . A. The justices on the Roth Court , however, coul d not agree on a defi nition of obsceni ty . 1.

Bu t im plicit in th e h isto ry o f th e First Am endm ent is the reject ion of obsceni ty as ut terly wi thout redeem ing soci al import ance.” 2. Critics obj ect: W ho is the Court to determ ine which kinds of speech have “redeem ing social im portance”? W here does the Constitution give the Court any guidance about which kinds of speech merit prot ect ion and whi ch do not ? B. In a separate opinion, Justice Ha rlan accused the m ajority of beggi ng the question. W hat question was that? The defi nition of pornography itself, we m ight say . 1. Just ice Harl an wrot e: “W e deal wi th hi ghl y em otional , not rat ional , quest ions. To m any, the Song of Solom on is obscene. I do not think we, the judges, were ever given the constitutional power to m ake defin itio ns of obscen ity.

Note here how Justice Harlan has com bined the ques tion of defi nition wi th anot her of t he them es t hat runs throughout our course—the power of judges to decide constitutional questions and the issue of what should be left to the political pr ocess or to the people them selves.

Fem inist legal theory has argued that all form s of pornography are deeply political because they em brace the subordination of wom en. 4.

G. One of the best exam ples of this new approach is in the case of Barnes v. Glen Theater , deci ded i n 1991. 1. In this case, the Court sustained an Indiana public decency statute as applied to nude dancing as a form of entertainm ent. 2.

B. In hi s m ajori ty opi nion, Just ice St evens rul ed t hat a federal law prohi biting i ntentional transm issi on of obscene or indecent m essages to m inors is unconstitu tional. In distinguishi ng the case from others involving indecent m aterial on television and radio, th e Court observed that the Internet is “a unique and whol ly new m edium of worl dwi de com muni cat ion.” 1. The first key question would seem to be: In what ways is the Internet unique? Is it unique because, unl ike som e ot her broadcast m edia, t he resource i s “unl imited”? 2. Is it unique because it transce nds state or national boundaries? C. More recently, in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition (2002), t he C ourt struck down a part of t he C hild Pornography Prot ect ion Act that regul ated “vi rtual chi ld pornography .” 1. Of course, a cent ral probl em here was t he inherent am bigui ty in such a prohi bition. 2. However, the state’s efforts to pr otect chi ldren on t he Int ernet m ight survi ve in ot her cont ext s if the governm ent can overcom e that am bigui ty. D.

These questions are im portant because they highlight the tension between our commitm ent to freed om of ex pressio n an d our co llectiv e in terest in protectin g su ch values as civ ility, so cial morality, and public order.

When, if ever, m ay society lim it speech because the expression in question is racist, bigoted, or hateful? May society lim it speech because it offends or tarnishes cherished national sym bol s, such as the flag? The Suprem e Court has struggled with each of th ese issues in the last few decades , and like its work in other First Am endm ent issues, t he deci sions hi ghl ight the tensi on bet ween l ibert y and com muni ty. II. Although such concept s as hate speech may seem of recent vintage, the Cour t has a long history in such areas. In two early cases, for exam ple, the Court tried to ba lance speech rights against a com munity’s interest in prohibiting offensive speech. One of these was Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire , deci ded i n 1942. However, I begin with a later case, Beauharnais v. Illinois (1952), because it dealt with r acially offensive speech. As it turns out, the Court’s m ost recent hate speech cases also often involve race, so I think it best to begin and end on t hat topi c. A. In Beauharnais v. Illinois (1952), the Court considered the constituti onality of a statute that m ade it a crim e to defam e any class of persons based on race or creed as “crim inal, unchaste, or lacking in virtue....” 1. In uphol ding t he st atute, t he m ajori ty not ed t hat it woul d be “arrant dogm atism” for t he C ourt to deny a state legislature the authority to pr otect society against such attacks. 2. It is import ant to not e that we m ight descri be t he co nflict h ere as b etween our co mmitm ents to freed om of speech and to equality, as well as between individual and com munity. 3. In t his case, t hen, t he C ourt wei ghed t he bal ance i n favor of com muni ty, but it recogni zed t hat in ot her cases, the balance m ight be struck differently. 4. In an im portant dissent, Justice D ouglas wrote: “Intem perate speech is the distinctive characteristic of man. Hotheads blow off and release destructive en ergy in the process. So it h as b een fro m th e beginning, so it will be throughout tim e. The Fram ers of the Constitution knew hum an nature as well as we do.” This seem s to recall the safety valve de fense of freedom of expressi on t hat we consi dered in an earlier lecture. B. I m entioned an earl ier case t hat laid som e of t he groundwork for Beauharnai s . In the im portant case of Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire (1942), t he C ourt consi dered a New Ham pshi re st atute that forbade t he use of “any offensi ve, deri sive, or annoy ing word t o any other person ... wi th an i ntent to deri de, offend, or annoy hi m.” 1. The fact s invol ved a Jehovah’s W itness, C hapl insky , who m ade a seri es of i nflam matory rem arks i n public in Ro chester, New Ham pshire. 2. A local police officer arrested Chapl insky , who had cal led t he offi cer a “God-dam ned racketeer” and a “fascist.” C. In hi s opi nion for t he C ourt , Just ice M urphy not ed t hat the Fi rst Am endm ent does not prot ect “fi ght ing words,” or words that tend “by their very utterance” to injure or to “i ncite to an im mediate breach of the peace.” 1. What would it m ean to say that a word “by its very utterance” tends to injure or incite a breach of peace? ©2006 The Teaching Com pany Lim ited Partnership 29"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" 2. Justice Murphy elaborated: “There are certain we ll-defined and narrowly lim ited classes of speech, the prevention and prohibition of whic h have never been thought to raise any constitutional problem . These include the lewd and the obscene, the prof ane, t he libelous, and t he insul ting or ‘fi ght ing’ words....” 3. The C ourt not ed t hat fight ing words “cont ribut e not hing t o the expressi on of i deas or t ruth” and t hat their v alue is o utweig hed by so ciety’s in terest in “o rder an d m orality.” 4. In this case, then, the Court e xplicitly m easured the speech agains t a particular theory about why speech is valuable in a dem ocracy. It m easured it, too, against our co llective interests in other values, such as “o rder an d m orality,” th e p reventio n of harm to others, o r perhaps, th e p romotio n of human digni ty. 5. Final ly, we shoul d ask i f there i s som e standard t hat allows us t o di stingui sh fi ght ing from nonfi ght ing words. The Court suggested that context w ould be a critical part of such a test. III. Cont ext was al so i mport ant in our next case. In Texas v. Johnson (1989), t he C ourt consi dered anot her ki nd of offensi ve expressi on—t he burni ng of an Am eri can fl ag. A. In a 5–4 opi nion, a di vided C ourt struck down a Texas st atute that prohi bited t he “desecrat ion of venerat ed objects,” such as a U.S. flag. In this case, a m an ha d burned t he fl ag i n prot est at the R epubl ican Nat ional Convent ion i n Dal las. B. In his opinion for the Court, Justi ce Brennan overturned the conviction because, in seeking to preserve the integri ty of t he fl ag as a sy mbol of nat ional uni ty, Texas had t read di rect ly on t he cont ent of t he intended message: “If t here i s a bedrock pri nciple underl ying t he Fi rst Am endm ent , it is that the governm ent m ay not prohibit expression of an idea sim ply because soci ety finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.” C. In dissent, Chief Justice Rehnquist de nied that the flag burning was an “essential part of any exposition of ideas” and, indeed, com pared it instead to “an inarticulate grunt.” In add itio n, th e Ch ief arg ued th at th e act convey ed not hing t hat “coul d not have been convey ed a nd was not convey ed just as forceful ly in a dozen different way s.” D. In a separat e di ssent , Just ice St evens not ed, “t he val ue of t he fl ag as a sy mbol cannot be m easured.” E. It is import ant, too, t o consi der a part of Just ice Kennedy ’s ext raordi nary concurri ng opi nion. W hat is import ant is not so m uch what it has t o say about the Fi rst Am endm ent , but rat her what it say s about one of the great them es—or, i f you prefer, one of t he great unanswered quest ions—of t his course: Do t he just ices just m ake i t up? Just ice Kennedy wrot e: “The hard fact is that som etimes we m ust m ake deci sions we do not like. W e m ake them because they are right—right in the sense that the law and the Constitution as we see them com pel the result.” IV. The C ourt revi sited Chapl insky ’s fi ght ing words doct rine in the import ant case of R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul (1992), a case that recalls, in som e ways, Beauharnai s . A. In th is case, th e Co urt ad dressed th e co nstitu tio nality o f a St. Pau l ordinance th at fo rbade p lacin g “o n public o r private p roperty a sym bol, o bject, ap pellatio n, ch aracterizatio n, or graffiti, in clu ding, but not limited t o, a burni ng cross or Nazi swast ika, whi ch one knows or has reasonabl e grounds t o know arouses anger, alarm , or resentm ent in others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, or gender.” B. The C ourt was unani mous i n striking down t he law, but the C ourt coul d m uster onl y a bare m ajori ty of 5–4 in favor of an opinion by Justice Scalia that found the statute unconstitutional as view poi nt di scri minat ion . In Justice Scalia’s opinion, the statute was unconstitutional because it prohibited only certain kinds of fight ing words but not all fight ing words. 1. Thi s am ount ed t o a ki nd of censorshi p, Just ice Scal ia wrot e. Agai n, we som etimes refer t o this as view poi nt di scri minat ion . 2. Th ere is, also , a p rincip le o f eq uality im plied by a p rohibitio n on viewp oint discrim inatio n. 3. Final ly, Just ice Scal ia also argued, “An ordi nance not limited t o the favored t opi cs ... woul d have precisely the sam e beneficial effect.” C. In a subsequent case, Virg inia v. Bla ck (2003), t he C ourt uphel d a Vi rgi nia statute that provi ded for enhanced crim inal penalties in cases involving racial “hate crim es.” Th e difference between that case and R.A.V. , wrot e Just ice O’C onnor, was t hat the st atute in Virg inia was directed to conduct, not speech. ©2006 The Teaching Com pany Lim ited Partnership 30"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" 1. Justice O’Connor wrote: “The Fi rst Am endm ent perm its Virginia to outlaw cross burning, because burni ng a cross i s a part icularl y vi rul ent form of i ntimidation.” 2. One m ight respond that this does not square ly face up to Justice Scalia’s opinion in R.A.V. or to th e question of whether such acti ons should be considered speech, no m atter how offensive. V. These cases rem ind us that speech m ay not be shut dow n sim ply because it offends or shocks. But they m ay also show that the traditional rationa les for protecting speech m ay be less pe rsuasive when the point is not so much about the com munication of ideas and is instead m ore about the vilification a nd intim idation of others.

Does the argum ent that freedom of speech is a necessary m echanism for the discove ry of truth require such to lerance, for exam ple?

Outline I. We typically think of freedom of sp eech as involving the right to speak our m inds, to say or express what we bel ieve. B ut shoul d i t also i nclude t he ri ght to be si lent—not in the cri minal sense, but in the sense t hat the st ate may not com pel us t o say what we m ight not bel ieve? A. Such cases ari se m ore frequent ly than one m ight imagine. Every day , thousands of st udent s reci te pl edges as school begi ns.

So metim es su ch oaths im plicate freed om of relig ion issues, as we shall see in Lectures Twenty-Five through Twenty-Seven, but they also rais e freedom of speech claim s, as well. II. Before we t ake up t hese i ssues, t his is an appropri ate poi nt to refl ect on fundam entals. A. We began our st udy of t he Fi rst Am endm ent by consi deri ng t he di fferent just ificat ions we can advance for prot ect ing freedom of expressi on. B. We then m oved to a discussion of som e specifi c First Am endm ent issues, such as illegal advocacy, pornography, and hate speech. C. We can say, I think, that no m atter what the specific issue, som e basic them es or principles are always present. 1. First , there i s the probl em of defi nition. 2. Second, we confront a wi de vari ety of doct rinal tool s and form ulas, t hough we m ay wonder how m uch they assist in reaching decisions. 3.

The probl em is: W hich branch of governm ent shoul d be ent rust ed wi th such wei ght y m atters? III. In Ta lley v.

But we shoul d consider, too, what kinds of interests m ight lie behind a governm ental regulation prohibiti ng anonym ous speech. IV. The Court’s m ost fam ous cases involving com pelled speech, however, ha ve not addressed the question of anonym ous speech but, instead, have considered the c onstitutionality of state laws requiring schoolchildren to salu te th e flag an d recite the Pledge of Allegiance. A. In the first of these cases, Min ersville v. Go bitis (1940), the Court upheld the constitutionality of the flag sal ute as an exerci se of t he st ate’s use of t he pol ice power t o prom ote pat riotism am ong t he st udent s. The Gobitis children, Jehovah’s W itnesses, were e xpelled after they refused to say the pledge. B. Writing for t he C ourt , Just ice Frankfurt er agreed t hat “every possi ble leeway shoul d be gi ven t o the cl aims of rel igious fai th” but nevert hel ess uphel d the school ’s requi rem ents. 1. Frankfurt er not ed, “The st ate’s i nterest is inferi or t o none.... Nat ional uni ty is the basi s of nat ional security.” 2. Frankfurter also struck a fam iliar chord about th e necessity for judicial deference to legislative aut hori ty as a cent ral feat ure of dem ocrat ic sel f-governance. C. Go bitis unl eashed a wave of persecut ion agai nst the W itnesses; the Justice Departm ent, for exam ple, recorded several cases of l ynchi ng and cast rations. D. The C ourt reopened t he issue t hree years later in the case of West Virg inia v. Ba rnette (1943). Thi s time, the C ourt changed i ts m ind, concl udi ng t hat a com pul sory pl edge “i nvades t he sphere of i ntellect and spi rit wh ich it is th e p urpose o f th e First Am endment ... to reserv e fro m all o fficial co ntrol.” E. In hi s opi nion for t he C ourt , Just ice Jackson began by not ing, “One’s ri ght to life, l ibert y, and propert y, to free speech, a free press, freedom of worship and a ssem bly, and other fundam ental rights m ay not be submitted to vote. Th ey d epend on th e o utcome of no electio n.” 1. This claim is fundam entally at odds with the claim made by Felix Frankfurter, writing for a m ajority in Min ersville . 2. Jackson cont inued: “The freedom assert ed by these appellees does n ot bring th em in to co llisio n with right s assert ed by any ot her i ndi vidual . Nor i s there any quest ion i n this case t hat their behavi or i s peaceable and orderly. The sole conflict is betw een authority and the ri ghts of the individual.” F. Just ice Jackson has descri bed t he confl ict in a part icular way . But we m ight rem ember t hat the com muni ty does have an i nterest in this case—t he prom otion of pat riotism, for exam ple—and we m ight wonder i f the First Am endm ent gi ves us any real gui dance about how t o wei gh t he bal ance. G. It is h ere th at we see th e im portan ce o f Jack son’s in sisten ce th at: “Th e very p urpose o f a Bill o f Rig hts was to withdraw certain subjects from th e vicissitudes of political controvers y, to place them beyond the reach of m ajorities....” H. Jackson cont inued: “Freedom to di ffer i s not limited t o things t hat do not m atter m uch.... The t est of [freedom ] is the ri ght to di ffer as t o things t hat touch t he heart of t he exi sting order.” The case, he wrot e, “is m ade difficult not because the principles of its d ecision are obscure, but because the flag involved is our own.” I. In a strongly worded and em otional dissent, Justi ce Frankfurter (who had written the m ajority opinion in Min ersville ) began, “One who belongs to the m ost vilified and persecuted m inority in history is not likely to be in sen sitiv e to th e freed oms g uaran teed by our Co nstitu tio n.” 1. Frankfurter also noted, in the sam e vein, “W ere m y purely personal a ttitude relevant, I should wholeheartedly associate m yself with the genera l lib ertarian views in th e Co urt’s o pinion.” 2. Why tell u s th at? W hy d oes it m atter wh at h is p ersonal opi nion woul d be? Just ice Frankfurt er rem inds us that there is a difference between a judge’s appeal to his or her own personal identity or personal set of beliefs an d th e o blig atio n to in terp ret th e Co nstitu tio n.

In part, this is because the First Am endm ent includes not one but two guarant ees desi gned t o prot ect rel igious freedom —t he est ablishm ent clause and the free exerci se cl ause.

M oreover, t he Founders e ither deci ded not to or negl ect ed t o gi ve us a defi nition of esta blish ment and free exercise and even of relig ion itself. Finally, in recent years a sharply divided Court has hinted at sweep ing changes in the long-settled doctr ines that m ake up freedom of rel igion juri sprudence. Outline I. Ev ery p olity m ust reco ncile th e d emands of relig ious faith (an d denial) with th e b eliefs o f others, as well as with th e co llectiv e welfare o f th e co mmunity. A. In th e Un ited States, th e p aram eters o f th is co nflict are sk etch ed out by th e relig ion clau ses o f th e First Am endm ent. This am endm ent, as m ost folks know, has two critical com ponents: 1. The fi rst is the est ablishm ent clause, whi ch provi des t hat “C ongress shal l m ake no l aw respect ing an estab lish ment o f relig ion.” 2. The second provi des t hat Congress shal l not prohi bit the “free exerci se” of rel igion. 3. We shall see that these two provisions have occas ioned an astonishingly co mplex and often confusing juri sprudence. 4. Som etim es, that confusion is directly traceable to the existence of the two cl auses—they do not always wo rk in tan dem, an d in deed , th ey so metim es seem to pull in differen t directio ns. B. There are ot her provi sions as wel l, m ost not abl y Art icle VI, whi ch provi des t hat there shal l be no rel igious test as a q ualificatio n fo r p ublic o ffice. C. We should note, however, that thes e prohibitions applied only to the fe deral governm ent until well into the 20 th cent ury, when t he rel igion cl auses were i ncorporat ed t hrough t he Fourt eent h Am endm ent . At the time of t he Foundi ng, for exam ple, m any states had est ablished rel igions and requi red rel igious oat hs for publ ic office. 1. As a consequence, alm ost all of the Co urt’s wo rk in th is area is fro m th e 2 0 th century. 2.

For exam ple, shoul d student s be al lowed t o pray at the begi nni ng of a sc hool day or at a school -sponsored event , such as a graduat ion? 1. How are we to decide such cases? Neith er th e estab lish ment clau se n or the free exercise clause clearly settles th e m atter. 2. In ot her words, we need som e interpret ive m ethod t o det erm ine the answer. C. Second, under what conditions, if any, should the com munity be perm itted to regulate or prohibit the religious beliefs of individual citi zens or religious groups? Should parent s, for exam ple, be perm itted to withhol d from their chi ldren cert ain types of m edical treat ments, such as bl ood t ransfusi ons, i f such treatm ents violate their faith? 1. These, t oo, are not m ere abst ract ions. There are hundreds of such cases, and i n m ost, if not all, of our choi ces t hey have profound consequences. 2. Justice Felix Frankfurter once referred to such clas hes as “great tragedies,” as conflicts not between right and wrong but bet ween com peting concept ions of what is good and what is right . III. Before we t ake up speci fic cases and i ssues, we shoul d consi der, at a hi gher l evel of abst ract ion, what the religion clauses were intended to accom plish. A. I don’t m ean so m uch t hat we shoul d engage i n a search for t he Fram ers’ i ntent.

One possi ble purpose i s to rem ove rel igion as a source of ci vil confl ict. The cl auses do t his, we m ight argue, insofar as they im muni ze religion from state control. C. They m ay also do i t by encouragi ng and prom oting rel igious pl ural ism. 1. By one survey , there are m ore t han 200 m ajor rel igious denom inations i n the Uni ted St ates and scores of so-cal led “m inor” fai ths. 2. The exi stence of so m any rel igions m ay hel p to keep any one of t hem from est ablishing a foot hol d i n the governm ent, but it also i ncreases t he opport uni ty for confl ict am ong t hem .

A. As we shal l see, t hese confl icts are especi ally pronounced i n the rel igion cases. B. It m ight be, however, that if we characterize the re ligion cases as just another exam ple of this larger tension, we m ight m iss som ething unique about religion as a constitutional liberty. C. Consider this question, for exam ple: Given that speech and expression are already protected, what was the need t o include t wo guarant ees for freedom of rel igion i n the Fi rst Am endm ent ? 1. One m ight argue t hat m ost, if not all, expressi ons of rel igious fai th woul d be prot ect ed under t he speech clauses. 2. Indeed, som e cases about rel igious freedom seem as t hough t hey were deci ded on ot her grounds, such as Min ersville and Ba rnette . D. Som e scholars and judges have argued that our inab ility or unwillingness to articulate a clear distinction between speech and religion reflects a failure to unde rstand how or why the Founders took special care to prot ect rel igion. V. Of course, another difficulty we will encounter will also seem fam iliar and is suggested by the foregoing issue. What is the defi nition of relig ion ? A. As we shal l see, t he C ourt ’s defi nition has changed dram atical ly over t he y ears, but at no t ime has t he Court been abl e to com e up wi th a com prehensi ve, uni versal defi nition. 1.

How does Justice Field know that this is the correct constitutional definition of relig ion ? 6. In a case deci ded al most a cent ury later, t his time invol ving t he Am ish, t he C ourt agai n st ruggl ed wi th questions about definition. In Wi sconsi n v.

One possibility is that the courts should decide, but there are profound dangers here. 2. A second possibility is to let indi viduals decide for them selves, but this, too, has several dangers, includi ng t he obvi ous one of abuse. VI. Final ly, we shal l see over t he next fe w lectures that few areas in civil lib erties are in as m uch tu rm oil as religion. In recent years, the Court has hinted at substantial and far-reach ing changes in long-settled rules and doctrin es. A.

Civil Lib erties is not , however, a course on l aw. It is, instead, a course t hat has as i ts subject the rel ationshi p of l aw t o the m ost fundam ental sort s of quest ions about politics, m orality, an d human nature. In th is co urse o f 36 lectu res, we sh all see th at m ost o f th e serio us difficu lties (an d th ere are m any) in th e p olitics o f civ il lib erties arise fro m co nflicts b etween our co mmitm ents to two or m ore p ositiv e v alues. Th ere are, fo r ex am ple, inevitable and recurrent conflicts (despite our attem pts to ignore them ) between the values of liberty and equality. As Fel ix Frankfurt er once wrot e, t hese and ot her such confl icts are “what the Greeks t housands of y ears ago recogni zed as a t ragi c issue, nam ely the cl ash of ri ght s, not the cl ash of wrongs.” W e exam ine these cl ashes i n light of the broader philosophical and institutional problem s of th e constitutional order. I hope to show that constitutional “answers” to problem s like those of abortion, freedom of speech, and affirm ative action require a coherent understanding of the Constitution and of the assum ptions it m akes about hum an nature and the proper ends of governm ent and ci vil soci ety. We will, th erefo re, ex am ine th e d octrin al d evelopment o f sp ecific lib erties an d rig hts, su ch as d ue process an d privacy, the ultim ate denial of liberty entailed by the death penalty, freedom of speech and religion, and equal prot ect ion, but we shal l consi der t hem in a broader t heoret ical cont ext .

The course is divided into three s ections. W e begin with the institutiona l and interpretive foundations of the Am erican constitutional order. Our purpose here is to provide students with backgr ound on the Suprem e Court and its ro le in th e co nstitu tio nal o rder, as well as an overview o f th e p rocess o f co nstitu tio nal in terp retatio n. In our first lect ure, for exam ple, we focus on t he organi zat ion, com posi tion, and deci sion-m aking aut hori ty of t he C ourt . In our second lecture, we take up the “why” a nd the “what” of constitutional interpreta tion. W e shall see that interpretation is both a choice and a necessity: a choice because we m ust choose am ong m any diverse m ethods and strategies and a burden because such choices are often di fficult to justify or even to explain. In Lectures Three and Four, we take up th e in tersectio n of Lectu res On e an d Two by co nsiderin g how an d wh y th e p ower o f co nstitu tio nal interp retatio n—and, hence, th e p ower to decid e th e m ost p ressin g issu es o f civ il lib erties—cam e to rest with th e Suprem e C ourt through t he m echani sm of judi cial revi ew. In the second section of the course, we begin our inquiry into the Bill of Right s. In every case that arises under the Bill of Rights, we m ust reconcile our desire for individual liberty with the need for public order, personal autonom y with th e n eed s o f th e co mmunity. Co nsidered in its to tality, an d not sim ply p rovisio n by provisio n, a b ill o f rig hts sketch es th e b road outlin es o f th e relatio nship between in dividual lib erty an d th e n eed s o f th e co mmunity. In th is larger sense, a bill of rights indicates how conflicts between liberty and co mmunity should be conceived and, to some ex ten t, reso lved. In our fifth lectu re, we co nsider th e h isto ry an d th eory o f th e Bill o f Rig hts. W as a b ill o f rights really necessary? And why, in itially, did its protections run only ag ainst the federal governm ent, not the states? In t he si xth l ect ure, we t ake up t he fasci nating doct rine of incorporatio n , or t he torturous and wi ndi ng road the Court followed to m ake the Bill of Rights applicable to state and lo cal governm ents—arguably a constitutional revol ution no l ess si gni ficant than t he Foundi ng i n Phi ladel phi a. In th e th ird an d, by far, th e larg est sectio n of th e course, com prising 30 l ect ures, we consi der t he indi vidual provisions of the Bill of Rights and the developm ent of several other specific lib erties.

Outline I. In t his lect ure, we st art our exam ination of t he est ablishm ent clause. As we shal l see, t he nat ion’s publ ic school s have l ong been a cent ral stagi ng poi nt for t he est ablishm ent clause. A. Thi s shoul d not be a surpri se. As Just ice R utledge once observed: Two great dri ves are const antly in m otion t o abri dge, i n the nam e of educat ion, t he com plete di vision of rel igion and ci vil aut hori ty.... One i s to introduce rel igious educat ion and observances i nto the publ ic school s. The ot her, t o obt ain publ ic funds for t he ai d and support of vari ous pri vate rel igious school s. B. There i s anot her reason why we shoul d not be surpri sed about the intersect ion of t he est ablishm ent clause and public schools. Until fairly recently, well into the 20 th cent ury, pri mary school educat ion i n the Uni ted States was largely a private affair, not in the hands of t he st ate but , rat her, a funct ion of churches and church organi zat ions. II. Som e of the earliest and still m ost controversial religion cases involve the role of prayer in the classroom . A. In En gel v. Vita le (1962), the Court invalidated a practice in Ne w York schools of reciting a short prayer at the begi nni ng of t he school day . B. In hi s m ajori ty opi nion, Just ice B lack concl uded t hat the establishm ent clause m ust at least m ean that it “is no part of t he busi ness of governm ent to com pose offi cial pray ers for any group of t he Am eri can peopl e....” C. Just ice B lack cont inued: “W e think t hat by usi ng t he publ ic school sy stem to encourage t he reci tation of the Regent ’s pray er, t he St ate of New York has adopt ed a pract ice whol ly inconsi stent wi th the Estab lish ment Clau se.” 1. The state had argued that the prayer was nondenom inational and, thus, presented no constitutional difficulty because it preferre d no religion over another. 2. The C ourt responded t hat it was t he si mple presence of t he st ate’s i nvol vem ent that was rel evant : “The Est ablishm ent Clause st ands as an expressi on of pri nciple on t he part of t he Founders t hat rel igion i s too personal , too sacred, t oo hol y” to perm it state regul ation i n this area. D. Just ice St ewart wrot e a st rongl y worded di ssent : I think this decision is wrong. I cannot see how an o fficial religion is estab lished by letting those who want to say a pray er say it. On t he cont rary , I t hink t hat to deny the wi sh of t hese school chi ldren t o joi n in reci ting t his pray er i s to deny them the opport uni ty of shari ng i n the spi ritual heri tage of t he nat ion. E. Im plicit in these t wo opi nions, I woul d suggest , are f undam entally di fferent concept ions of rel igion i n general . Just ice B lack’s opi nion for t he C ourt underscores the “pri vat eness” of rel igious fai th, or t he way in ©2006 The Teaching Com pany Lim ited Partnership 3"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" whi ch fai th and aut onom y are i ntertwined. Just ice St ewart , in cont rast , not es how i mport ant publ ic expressi ons of fai th can be. III. In a second case, Abi ngt on v. Schempp (1963), t he C ourt inval idated B ible readi ngs and t he reci tation of t he Lord’s Pray er i n publ ic school classroom s. A. In bot h cases, t he C ourt concl uded t hat the chal lenge d pract ices had no val id secul ar purpose and, t hus, could not stan d. Ho wev er, th e stu dy of relig ion, an d ev en th e Bib le, wo uld be co nstitu tio nally p erm issib le “when present ed object ively as part of a secul ar program of educat ion.” B. Engel and Schempp initiated a volatile public debate on the role of prayer in the schools that shows no sign of abat ing nearl y 50 y ears l ater. 1. Many school s, especi ally in part s of t he Sout h, have l ong i gnored t he C ourt ’s rul ings. 2. The rol e of pray er i n school s has been a pronounced i ssue i n several presi dent ial cam pai gns. 3. For exam ple, i n 1964, B arry Gol dwat er argued, “The C ourt rul ed agai nst God.” 4. U.S. Represent ative George Andrews (D-Al a.) com plained, “They put the Negroes i n school s and now they have dri ven God out .” IV. The cont inui ng cont roversy over pray er i n school s has al so kept these cases on t he C ourt ’s agenda. Three m ore recent cases have provoked intense debate both inside the Court and in the public square. A. In Wallace v. Jaffree (1985), t he C ourt struck down an Al abam a law t hat m andat ed a one-m inut e “m om ent of silence” at the beginning of the sc hool day. Relying heavily on the legi slative history on this particular statute, a m ajori ty concl uded t hat the purpose of t he law was t o prom ote rel igion. Presum abl y, a m oment of silen ce d esig ned to fu rth er a secu lar p urpose wo uld be co nstitu tio nally p erm issib le. 1. This case is central to the establis hm ent clause, not sim ply because of the m oment of silence issue, but because in it, the Chief Justice proffered a fundam entally different approach to thinking about the meani ng and purpose of t he est ablishm ent clause. 2. On t he ot her hand, i t m ay be t hat the m ore i mmediate aspect s of Wallace are less sig nifican t in lig ht of Lee v. Weisman , our next case. B. In Lee v. Weisman (1992), the Court considered the c onstitutionality of a recitation of a “nondenom inational ” pray er at a hi gh school graduat ion cerem ony . In hi s opi nion for t he C ourt , Just ice Kennedy argued t hat although at tendance at the cerem ony was vol unt ary as a m atter of l aw, i n pract ice, t he event was of “singular im portance” and the “objec ting student had no real alternative to avoid.” 1. Consequently, the prayer was unconstitutional, becau se “No holding by this Court suggests that a school can persuade or com pel a st udent to part icipate in a rel igious exerci se.” 2. Just ice Kennedy cont inued: The l essons of t he Fi rst Am endm ent are as urgent in the m odern worl d as t he 18 th century when it was written. One tim eless lesson is that if citi zens are subjected to state-sponsored religious exerci ses, t he St ate di savows i ts own dut y to guard and respect that sphere of i nvi olabl e conscience and belief which is the m ark of a free people. 3. The C ourt also t ook up t he issue of “coerci on,” or t he cl aim that student s m ight feel coerced by the state in to particip atin g in su ch ex pressio ns of faith . As we saw, th is issu e lo omed larg e in th e Co urt’s first school pray er cases. 4. In di ssent , Just ice Scal ia rem inded t he C ourt , “The history and t radi tion of our Nat ion are repl ete wi th public cerem onies featu ring prayers o f th anksgiving an d petitio n.... Fro m our Natio n’s o rigin, p rayer has been a prom inent part of governm ental cerem oni es and procl amations.” 5. He t hen cont inued: “Today ’s opi nion shows m ore forceful ly than vol um es of argum ent ation why our Nat ion’s prot ect ion, why our Nat ion’s com mitment to pray er t hrough t he Fi rst Am endm ent m ust be em braced by citizens, perhap s even m ore than judges.” 6. Justice Scalia also tried to refram e th e b asic p osture of the case, noting, “The reader has been told much i n this case about the personal interest s of M r. W eisman and hi s daught er, t he pl aintiff, and very little about the personal interests of the other side.” He continues: “They are not inconsequential. Church and St ate woul d not be such a di fficul t subject if rel igion were, as t he C ourt ’s approach t hinks it to be, som e purel y personal avocat ion t hat can be i ndul ged ent irely in secret , like pornography in the pri vacy of one’s room . For m ost bel ievers, i t is not that and has never been.” ©2006 The Teaching Com pany Lim ited Partnership 4"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":" 7. Just ice Scal ia concl uded: “One can bel ieve i n the effect iveness of such publ ic worshi p, or one can deprecate and deride it. But the longstanding Am eri can tradition of prayer at official cerem onies displ ays wi th unm istakabl e cl ari ty that the Est ablishm ent Clause does not forbi d the governm ent to accom modate it.” C. Fin ally, in Sant a Fe v. Doe (2000), the Court struck down a school di strict policy that perm itted students to lead a pray er before hi gh school foot bal l gam es. V. Anot her area i nvol ving t he est ablishm ent clause and publ ic school s where t he C ourt has been act ive concerns the use of publ ic m oni es and ot her ki nds of publ ic support for pri vate school s. A. We begi n wi th the landm ark case of Everson v. Board of Educat ion (1947), i n whi ch t he C ourt insisted t hat the establishm ent clause envisions a strict “w all of separat ion” bet ween church and st ate. B. In t his case, t he C ourt nevert hel ess went on t o uphol d a st ate program that used publ ic funds t o provi de transport ation of st udent s to parochi al school s. 1. The pri mary purpose of t he fundi ng, t he C ourt argued, was secul ar and i ntended t o benefi t the school chi ldren, not the school or t he rel igion i n quest ion, t hus gi ving ri se t o the child benefit th eory . 2. The “wall of separation” reference in Everson rem ains deepl y cont roversi al, bot h on and off t he C ourt . C. On e year later, in McCo llu m v. Illin ois (1948), the Court struck down a program perm itting public school student s to attend weekl y rel igious cl asses on school prem ises. In cont rast to Everson , the C ourt concl uded, the prim ary purpose of the “released time” program was not secul ar. D. Since Everson and McCollum , the C ourt has produced an ast oni shi ngl y com plex body of case l aw, som etimes uphol ding st ate ai d, as i n the case of st ate subsi dies for books and t ests, and i n ot her cases condem ning it, as in subsidies for teacher salaries and field trips. E. In Mitch ell v. Helms (2000), t he C ourt approved a federal program that provi ded ai d for school di stricts that purchased curri cul ar m aterials and l ent them to pri vate school s. F. Mitch ell was fol lowed by the import ant case of Zel man v.

Scope: In the previous lecture, we addressed the cases of Everson and Jaffree in light of t he C ourt ’s school pray er juri sprudence. As we shal l see here, however, t hese two cases are al so a useful introduct ion t o anot her, perhaps larger issue that has troubl ed the Court in recent years: Does the establishm ent clause require governm ent neutrality to all form s of religious belief and nonbelief, or does it sim ply prohibit the governm ent from favori ng one rel igion over anot her? The C ourt in Everson adopted the form er position, sometim es called th e strict sep aratio nist p ositio n . In recent years, though, several m embers of the Court have reject ed i t in favor of t he so-cal led acco mmo datio nist p ositio n , wh ich wo uld allo w at least so me form s of non-preferent ial governm ental aid t o rel igion. Anot her and rel ated cont roversy concerns doct rine. In t he wel l-known case of Lemon v. K urtzman (1971), t he C ourt devel oped a t hree-part test for distinguishing between establishm ent and nonestablishm ent. In recent years, however, there has been subst antial di vision wi thin the C ourt about whet her and when t o use t he Lemon test, and som e justices, notably O’Connor, have proposed alte rnatives. Behind both positions, we sh all see, are different visions about the proper rel ationshi p bet ween church and st ate. Outline I. As we saw in Lecture Twenty-Five, in Everson v. Board of Educat ion (1947), t he C ourt insisted t hat the establishm ent clause envisions a strict “wa ll of separat ion” bet ween church and st ate. A. The m etaphor was t aken from a wel l-known l etter by Thom as Jefferson [fi rst cited by the Suprem e C ourt , alb eit with a less strict v iew o f sep aratio n, in Reynol ds v. Uni ted St ates in 1878] . B. The posi tion adopt ed by the C ourt in Everson is known as t he strict sep aratio nist p ositio n . It dom inated the Court ’s underst andi ng of t he est ablishm ent clause for just about 40 y ears aft er Everson . C. Not withstandi ng i ts doct rinal dom inance, t here was al way s di sagreem ent wi thin the C ourt about just how strict the separation between c hurch and state really was. R ecall, for exam ple, that in Everson itself, th e doct rine di d not precl ude st ate ai d t o parochi al school s, a resul t that prom pted Just ice Jackson, di ssent ing, to note: “The case which irresistibly com es to m ind ... is that of Julia who, according to Byron’s reports, ‘wh isperin g “I will n ever co nsent,”—co nsented .’” II. In Lemon v. K urtzman (1971), t he C ourt adopt ed a form al three-part test for est ablishm ent cases. A. Go vernmental aid will p ass co nstitu tio nal m uster if: 1. It has a val id secul ar purpose. 2. Its pri mary effect is nei ther t o advance nor i nhi bit rel igion. 3. It does not lead t o “excessi ve governm ent ent angl em ent ” wi th rel igion. B. The Lemon test has been the prim ary analytical tool for several decades, but several m embers of the Court have expressed di ssat isfact ion wi th the test. III. In a few subsequent cases, som e m embers of t he C our t attacked t he st rict separat ioni st underst andi ng of t he establishm ent clause. The leading case is Wallace v. Jaffree (1985), whi ch we covered i n Lect ure Twent y-Fi ve. Jaffree , you will recall, involved an Alabam a statute that established a m oment of silence at the beginning of the school day . A. Just ice St evens, wri ting for t he C ourt , struck t he st atute. B ut for our purposes, t he opi nion i s signi ficant because in it, Chief Justice Rehnqui st wrote long and eloquently in a dissenting opinion a bout the strict separat ioni st posi tion. B. Calling appeals to the Jeffersonian wall “a m istak en understanding of constitu tional history,” Rehnquist went on t o concl ude t hat such an underst andi ng of the Fi rst Am endm ent was “hi ghl y simplified” and a faul ty basi s for t he C ourt ’s juri sprudence. C. In his own review of constitutiona l history, Rehnquist concluded that the Founders were not opposed to state ai d t o rel igion, provi ded such ai d was not itself di scri minat ory bet ween and am ong rel igions. The establishm ent clause “did not re quire governm ent neutrality between religion and irreligion, nor did it prohi bit the Federal Governm ent from provi ding nondi scri minat ory aid t o rel igion.” ©2006 The Teaching Com pany Lim ited Partnership 7"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":" D.

W e begin in this l ecture with the Court’s earliest cas es, m any of whi ch concerned t he rel igious bel iefs and pract ices of t he fl edgl ing M orm on C hurch. In Reynol ds v.

Hi aleah (1993), i nvol ving ani mal sacri fices as a part of a rel igious cerem ony . Outline I. The free exercise clause is an essential part of our First Am endm ent freedom s, if only because constitutional dem ocracy seem s to require freedom of conscience. A. Like freedom of speech, therefore, the free exercise clause has as one of its prim ary purposes protecting individual autonom y and right s of conscience, partly an inherita nce from the political philosophy of John Locke. B. In part because expression and relig ion are so closely tied, however, m any of the cases that involve free exercise issues are decided on th e basis of the speech clauses. II. This purpose, coupled with the language of the constituti onal text, m eans that there is at least one undisputed underst andi ng of t he free exerci se cl ause: A. The st ate m ay not puni sh i ndi vidual s for hol ding or reject ing part icular rel igious bel iefs. B. If th ere is an ab solute rig ht in Am erican co nstitu tio nal law, it is th is rig ht to believ e wh atev er o ne wan ts. It is difficult to im agine any situation in which a state governm ent c ould have the constitutional authority to puni sh an i ndi vidual simply on t he basi s of bel ief al one. III. On the other hand, as we have seen, the exercise of individual freedom s always takes place in a larger com muni ty. One m ay bel ieve what ever one want s, but once we act on our bel iefs, we becom e m ore l ikely to run up agai nst the bel iefs of ot hers or t he interest s of t he com muni ty. A. At what poi nt shoul d a cl aim of free exerci se excuse pract ices t hat implicat e the interest s of ot hers? Thi s is the cent ral quest ion i n m ost free exerci se cases and wi th whi ch t he C ourt has st ruggl ed si nce i t first took up such cases in the late 19 th century. B. In Reynol ds v. Uni ted St ates (1878), the Court considered the cons titutionality of a congressional statute that prohi bited pol ygam y in U.S. t erritories. The l aw was di rect ed agai nst the M orm ons, who had m igrat ed to Ut ah t o avoi d rel igious persecut ion. C. In Davis v. Beason (1890), t he C ourt uphel d anot her ant i-Morm on st atute.

The C ourt had no di fficul ty uphol ding t he law. In response t o M orm on cl aims that the law deni ed t hem free exerci se, t he C ourt , speaki ng t hrough Just ice Fi eld, observed: “B igam y and pol ygam y are cri mes by the laws of al l civilized and C hristian count ries. They tend t o dest roy the puri ty of t he m arriage relation, to disturb the peace of fam ilies, to degrade wom an and to debase m an.” 2.

Although i t m ay seem clear, t he bel ief-conduct di stinction i s not the onl y avai lable readi ng of t he free exercise clause nor necessarily the m ost obvious one. In addition, the line between belief and conduct may not be so easy to find i n any part icular case. IV. The bel ief-act ion di stinction, so prom inent in the M orm on cases, rem ains a part of t he C ourt ’s doct rinal tool chest. A. As we saw, t he di stinction was a part of Just ice Frankfurt er’s opi nion for t he C ourt in Min ersville , for exam ple. An d, as we sh all see in Lectu re Twen ty-Eig ht, th e Co urt still calls o n it fro m tim e to tim e. B. But the distinction is just one way to strike the balance between liberty and com munity. In m ore recent cases, t he C ourt has devel oped di fferent fram eworks. C. In Church of the Lukumi Babal u Aye, Inc. v. Hi aleah (1993), the Court considered the constitutionality of a muni cipal ordi nance, adopt ed i n an em ergency sessi on, t hat prohi bited t he ri tual sacri fice of ani mals “not for t he pri mary purpose of food consum ption.” The ordi nance was di rect ed agai nst a Sant eri an church, wh ich co mbines elem ents o f Cath olicism an d so me trad itio nal African relig ious practices, in clu ding ritu al anim al sacrifice. D. In st riking t he ordi nance, t he C ourt , in an opi nion by Just ice Kennedy , not ed t hat city offi cials had not act ed neut ral ly—i n ot her words, t he law t hey passed was not neut ral toward rel igion—i n pursui t of som e larger secul ar end, but instead, t he law had as i ts ve ry purpose “t he suppressi on of rel igion” and “ani mosi ty to Sant eri a adherent s and t heir rel igious pract ices.” 1. Just ice Kennedy wrot e: “Our revi ew confi rms that the laws i n quest ion were enact ed by offi cials who did not underst and, fai led t o percei ve, or chose t o ignore t he fact that their offi cial act ions vi olated t he natio n’s essen tial co mmitm ent to relig ious freed om.” 2. Recal l that the fi rst prong of t he Lemon test requi res t hat the purpose of a governm ental regul ation at issue m ust be secular in nature. Only rarely will the state fail to pass the first prong, but this is one of the cases. As Just ice Kennedy concl uded, “The r ecord in this case com pels the conclusion that suppressi on of t he cent ral elem ent of t he Sant eri a worshi p servi ce was t he object of t he ordi nance.” 3. Thus, “Legi slators m ay not devi se m echani sms, overt or di sgui sed, desi gned t o persecut e or oppress a relig ion or its p ractices. Th e laws h ere in questio n were en acted co ntrary to th ese co nstitu tio nal principles, and they are void.” E. One m ight concl ude t hat Hialeah is an easy case—no m atter the doctrinal test one uses, whether the Lemon test or one’s underst andi ng of t he free exerci se cl ause m ore general ly, a governm ental pol icy speci fical ly and ex plicitly d esig ned to burden a p articu lar relig ion m ust b e unconstitu tio nal. 1. In other words, the Hialeah law failed a basic com mand of the free ex ercise clause: that the state m ust be neut ral toward rel igion. 2. But questions about whether neut rality should be the rule—and what it requires—prom pted a heated exchange am ong t he just ices, especi ally bet ween Jus tices Kennedy and Sout er and, t o a l esser ext ent, Scalia. 3. Justice Souter, for exam ple, wrote: “A law that is religion neutral on its face or in its purpose m ay lack neutrality in its effect b y fo rbidding so mething th at relig ion req uires” o r, altern ativ ely, b y “req uirin g something th at relig ion fo rbids.... A secu lar law, ap plicab le to all, th at p rohibits co nsumptio n of alcohol, for exam ple, will affect m embers of religions that require the use of wine” in their services. He went on to use a specific ex am ple: “W ithout an exception for sacram ental wine, Prohibition m ay fail th e test o f relig ion neutrality.” 4. We m ight call such an account of neutrality “form al,” in that neutrality m eans t o m ake no account for rel igion.

The sam e is true in the area of fr ee exercise. In this lecture, we consider one such change. Im agine a law that is evid ently n eutral to ward th e ex ercise o f relig ion—say, a law requi ring al l bui ldings t o have fi re escapes or a l aw t hat prohi bits the consum ption of cert ain ki nds of drugs. Shoul d a cl aim of free exerci se excuse som e indi vidual s from the appl icat ion of t hese ot herwi se “neutral” laws? For m any y ears, following the case of Sherbert v. Verner (1963), t he C ourt rul ed t hat the free exercise clause did com pel an exem ption, unless the state could advance a “com pelling reason” that ought to precl ude such an exem ption. In Empl oyment Di vision v. Smi th (1990), however, t he C ourt reversed t his posi tion, rul ing i n an opi nion by Just ice Scalia that the free exerci se cl ause does not requi re the state to “accom modate” a claim of free exercise. Of course, the Court left intact the rule requiring a com pelling i nterest in those cases when t he st ates do seek t o purposeful ly burden rel igion di rect ly.

Outline I. As we have seen in the last two lectures, in m ost free exercise cases, we encounter a fam iliar tension, the conflict b etween th e d emands of lib erty an d th e n eed s o f th e co mmunity. A. These kinds of conflicts are especially pronounced in free exercise cases, in part because it is here, m ore than anywhere else, that constitutionalism prizes i ndividual autonom y in m atters of faith. But acting on faith often im plicates th e rig hts an d lib erties o f others. B. In every case, t herefore, t he C ourt struggl es wi th a basi c quest ion: how t o wei gh t he bal ance bet ween lib erty an d co mmunity? C. The C ourt has devel oped di fferent doct rinal tool s to he lp it wei gh t he bal ance. It is import ant to recogni ze that behi nd t he tool s are basi c assum ptions and di ffere nt vi sions of hum an di gni ty, indi vidual freedom , and the nat ure of our shared publ ic life. II. On e o f th ese to ols, as we saw in Lectu re Twen ty-Sev en, is th e b elief-actio n distin ctio n. On e o f th e d ifficu lties with this doct rine, however, i s that on i ts own, i t tells us al most not hing about when and why the st ate m ay regul ate rel igious act ions or about how t o wei gh t he bal ance bet ween l ibert y and com muni ty in such cases. III. Before we take up the Court’s recent work, however, we should note that the c onstruction of constitutional meani ng i s an ent erpri se not confi ned t o the C ourt alone. As we shal l see i n this lect ure i n part icular, C ongress and th e ex ecu tiv e b ranch also play im portan t ro les in th e p rotectio n of civ il lib erties an d in th e larg er en terp rise of co nstitu tio nal in terp retatio n. IV. In the im portant case of Sherbert v. Verner (1963), t he C ourt advanced a rul e desi gned t o tip the scal e in favor of relig ious lib erty. A. The C ourt rul ed t hat a st ate regul ation t hat is neut ral toward rel igion i n purpose, but nonet heless “su bstan tially b urdens” a relig ious practice, m ust b e justified by a “co mpellin g state in terest.” Th is test is the sam e one t he C ourt uses i n fundam ental right s cases, such as pri vacy cases. B. In th is case, th e Co urt ru led unconstitu tio nal a state law th at d enied Sh erb ert u nemploym ent co mpensatio n because, as a Seventh Day Adventist, she refused to accept a job that required her to work on Saturdays. The l aw di d not singl e out rel igion as a reason for t he deni al of benefi ts, but it di d, t he C ourt concl uded, have a “subst antial” effect on her rel igious pract ices. C. Writing for t he C ourt , Just ice B rennan sai d, “The rul ing by the st ate forces her t o choose bet ween following the precepts of her religion and forfeiting be nefits, on the one hand, and abandoning one of the precepts of her religion to accept benefits, on the othe r hand.” The burden on Sherbert is having to choose between the precepts of her faith and unem ploym ent com pensation. ©2006 The Teaching Com pany Lim ited Partnership 12"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":" D.

In this case, the state’s interests, presum ably, are fiscal responsibility and adm inistrative convenience. 2. Th e Co urt h as rep eated ly h eld th at n eith er in terest is co mpellin g. G. Final ly, we shoul d reopen t he ques tion we addressed i n our l ast lect ure. How shoul d we underst and t he secu lar reg ulatio n ru le in lig ht of th e co ncep t o f neutrality in free ex ercise? 1. It seem s m ost lik ely th at th e secu lar reg ulatio n ru le p oints to a co ncep tio n of su bstan tiv e, in stead of form al, n eutrality. 2. But to ful ly underst and t he issue, we m ust also i nqui re i nto the purposes of t he free exerci se cl ause. If one purpose is to protect an indi vidual’s right to believe, then wh ich conception of neutrality should we adopt? Perhaps, we m ight argue , we should adopt a position of form al neutrality, which m ight lead us to th ink th at Sherbert was decided incorrectly. 3. But anot her way to underst and t he cl ause i s to see i n it a purpose t o prom ote rel igious di versi ty and com munities of believers. On this understanding, Sherbert m ay be correctly decided. V. The Suprem e C ourt overrul ed Sherbert (an d th e so -called “secu lar reg ulatio n” ru le) in th e im portan t an d cont roversi al case of Empl oyment Di vision v. Smi th (1990). A. Just ice Scal ia, wri ting for t he m ajori ty, descri bed t he case: “R espondent s in the present case cont end t hat their religious m otivation for using peyote places them beyond the reach of the crim inal law that is not specifically directed at their religious practice.” B. Just ice Scal ia cont inued by argui ng: “To m ake an i ndi vidual ’s obl igation t o obey such a l aw cont ingent upon the law’s coincidence with his religious beliefs, except where the State’s interest is ‘com pelling,’ ... contrad icts b oth co nstitu tio nal trad itio n an d co mmon sen se.” 1. Thi s, of course, i s preci sel y what the secul ar regul ation rul e requi res. 2. Acco rding to Ju stice Scalia, h owever, th is ru le d efies “co mmon sen se” an d “co nstitu tio nal trad itio n.” C. He cont inued i n hi s opi nion t o overrul e Sherbert and to replace it with a new ru le: The free exercise clause does not require the state to “accom moda te” a claim of free exercise. In other words, in cases where the state regul ation does not purposeful ly burden rel igion, t he st ate need no l onger dem onst rate that there i s a com pelling state interest. D. Instead , th e state n eed only sh ow th at th e law is “ratio nal,” th us recallin g th e ratio nal b asis test th e Co urt uses i n cases of nonfundam ental right s. E. Of co urse, th e Co urt left in tact th e ru le req uirin g a com pelling interest in those cases where the states do seek t o purposeful ly burden rel igion di rect ly. F. The deci sion prom pted a st rongl y worded di ssent by Just ice B lackm un, who not ed, “Thi s C ourt over t he years painstakingly has developed a consistent and exacting standard.... Until today, I thought this was a settled an d in violate p rincip le.” G. Other criticism s of the new rule suggest that it m ay be fundam entally hostile to the purpose of the free exercise clause because it fails to account for the harm actually done to com munities of faith.

Scope: In a great m any cases, the religion clauses work in tandem to secure religious freedom . In som e cases, however, t hey appear t o be at odds. As Just ice St ewart not ed i n Abi ngt on v.

As we have seen, t he two rel igion cl auses oft en work toget her t o offer a wi de-rangi ng set of prot ect ions for rel igious freedom . A. In som e cases, however, the establis hm ent and free exercise clauses appear to be in som e tension with each other. B. In “the Peyote Case” [ Empl oyment Di vision v. Smi th , 1990] , for exam ple, t he C ourt rul ed t hat the st ate need not m ake an exem ption for t he use of pey ote in rel igious cerem oni es. W hat if the C ourt had rul ed otherwise, holding that the free exer cise clause dem ands such an exem ption? W oul d such an exem ption, presum ably required by the free exerci se clause, run afoul of the estab lishm ent clause, because it tends to establish the Native Am erican Church? C. Justice Stewart also observed, for exam ple, in Abi ngt on v. Schempp (1963), t hat the dem ands of free exercise m ight som etim es require governm ental accom modation, but any such accom modation m ight implicat e the est ablishm ent clause. He wrot e “A l onel y sol dier st ationed at som e faraway out post coul d surel y com plain that a governm ent whi ch di d not provi de hi m the opport uni ty for personal gui dance was ... prohi biting t he free exerci se of hi s rel igion.” II. In such i nstances, shoul d our ai m be t o reconci le the cl auses as best we can? Or, al ternat ively, shoul d we gi ve each full expression even if they appear to conflict? A. We mu st reme mb er, as I have stressed before, that these issues are not just abst ract ions. C onsi der, for exam ple, the case of Wi sconsi n v. Yoder (1972). In t his case, W isconsi n requi red al l chi ldren t o attend school until the age of 16. The m embers of an Old Orde r Am ish sect refused to send their 14- and 15-year- old chi ldren t o publ ic school s. 1. One m ight descri be t he cl aims adva nced by the Am ish in several ways. W e m ight see the claim as a versi on of a parent al libert y to di rect the upbri ngi ng of t heir chi ldren. 2. Altern ativ ely, we m ight describ e th is as a classic free exercise claim . B. The C ourt ’s deci sion t o exem pt the Am ish from com pul sory attendance l aws m ight be a fai r readi ng of t he free exercise clause. But doesn’t a special exem ption for the Am ish from these otherwise general and universal laws tend to “advance” religion? C. Chief Just ice B urger began hi s opi nion for t he C ourt by not ing, “Provi ding publ ic school s ranks at the very apex of the function of the state.” 1. Chief Justice Burger starts with this point because there can be little doubt that this is an im portant and substan tial state in terest. 2. Would such an interest, however, be com pelling? There is little doubt that the Court would find the provi sion of publ ic educat ion a com pelling st ate interest in the abst ract , but here, t he interest m ight be more narrow—we woul d ask, does t he st ate have a com pelling i nterest in provi ding t hese chi ldren with a publ ic educat ion bet ween t he ages of 13 and 16? ©2006 The Teaching Com pany Lim ited Partnership 15"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":" D.

One underst andi ng, we saw, i s that the purpose of t he cl ause i s to est ablish a pri nciple of form al neutrality and to protect an individual right to free dom of belief or nonbelief. 2. Another understanding of free exercise , however, sees a purpose to protect com munities of faith and to prom ote the fl ouri shing of rel igion i n Am eri can soci ety. 3.

In part icular, t he C ourt ’s di scussi on about the negat ive effect s of exposure t o secul ar cul ture on t he bel iefs of Am ish chi ldren recal ls the second purpose we descri bed. F. Chief Just ice B urger t hus concl uded: “A st ate’s i nterest in uni versal educat ion, however hi ghl y we rank i t, is not totally free from a bal anci ng process when i t impinges on fundam ental right s interest s, such as t hose specifically protected by the Free Ex ercise Clause.” The task, first, is to balance these com peting constitutional interests. Moreover, we m ust balan ce them using a constitutional calculus—it is not enough for a judge si mply to announce t hat one val ue ranks hi gher t han anot her. G. In a dissent, Justice Douglas argued that the m ajority ’s decision was flawed because it failed to consider the constitutional interests of the Am ish children. He argued that the Court’s d ecision failed to account for those children who m ight want to leave their com munities but would be inhibited from doing so without a proper or com plete publ ic school educat ion. III. No w we can retu rn to th e issu e we b egan with : Do es th e exem ption for t he Am ish, whet her requi red by the free exercise clause or not, offe nd the establishm ent clause? A. Som e judges, such as C hief Just ice R ehnqui st, have not ed t hat any confl ict bet ween t he two cl auses i s an art ifice of judi cial deci sions t hat have defi ned one or bot h of t he cl auses, especi ally the est ablishm ent clause, t oo broadl y. 1. Chief Justice Rehnquist likewise suggested that if we adopt an accom modationist perspective of the est ablishm ent clause, i nstead of a st rict separat ion perspect ive, m any of t hese probl em s woul d disappear. (See Lecture Twenty-Six.) 2. Thi s, however, m ight pri vilege rel igion over i rrel igion and, i n so doi ng, cont radi ct one of t he cent ral purposes of t he Fi rst Am endm ent : to prot ect our com mitment to indi vidual aut onom y in m atters of bel ief and nonbel ief. B. This should rem ind us that constitutional interpretati on is a com plex and difficult enterprise and that it nearly always involves questions th at reach beyond the specifics of any particular case or decision. C. Anot her approach m ight be t o insist, as som e schol ars and judges have, t hat we adopt a si ngl e st andard of neutrality for bot h cl auses. Thi s m ight resul t, however, i n real hardshi ps for som e rel igions. And t hat m ight confl ict wi th one of t he underl ying purposes of t he rel igion cl auses: to prom ote rel igious di versi ty. D. The key issue, from a perspective concerned with constitutional interpre tation, m ust be the necessity of grounding one approach or the other in the Constituti on itself.

Outline I. “W e hol d t hese t ruths t o be sel f-evi dent ,” wrot e Thom as Jefferson, “that all m en are created equal.” Yet these ringing words from the Declaration of Independence were found nowhere in the Constitution ratified in 1789.

When C ongress sought to ban t he furt her i ntroduct ion of sl aves i nto M issouri —a sl ave t erritory—as a condition of statehood, a m ajor conflict erupted, in whic h several Southern states threatened to secede. C. The conflict was resolved by the Missouri Com prom ise of 1820, which adm itted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state and prevented slavery in the Loui siana Terri tory nort h of l atitude 36° 30' . D. Th e co mpromise was sh ort-liv ed an d was fin ally scu ttled in th e im portan t case o f Dred Scot t v. Sandf ord (1856 sessi on; deci ded 1857). VI.

The deci sion t urned t echni cal ly on whet her Scot t was a ci tizen and, t hus, had t he ri ght to sue hi s owner i n a federal court . C. Chief Just ice R oger Taney opens t he m ajori ty opi nion wi th the fol lowing: “The quest ion i s simply this: Can a Negro, whose ancest ors were i mport ed i nto this count ry, and sol d as sl aves, becom e a m ember of t he political com munity form ed and brought into existe nce by the Constitution of the United States? ” D.

The decision of that questi on belonged to the political or lawm aking power....” E. Co ming to th e m erits o f th e case, Tan ey co ncluded th at wh en th e Co nstitu tio n was ratified , African Am ericans, slaves or not, were not citizens. W as Sc ott—or any of the slaves—a citizen? “W e think they are not, and that they are not include d, and were not intended to be in cluded, under the word ‘citizens’ in the Constitution ... On the contrary, they were at that tim e”—he m eant the Founding—“considered as a subordi nat e and i nferi or cl ass of bei ngs.” And he cont inued; this “subordi nate, inferi or cl ass of bei ngs,” he wrote, is “... altogether unfit to a ssociate with the white race ... and so far inferior that they had no rights whi ch t he whi te m an was bound t o respect .” ©2006 The Teaching Com pany Lim ited Partnership 19"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" F.

Consequen tly, Congress could not interfere with the slave trade because to do so woul d vi olate the propert y right s of sl ave owners. Thi s had t he effect of renderi ng t he M issouri Co mpromise—th e last g reat p olitical effo rt to settle th e slav ery q uestio n—unconstitu tio nal. G.

The Court’s decision thus reopened f undam ental questions about the constitutional order, including questions about the nature of citizenship and com munity. A. It also reopened questions about constitutional interpretation and judicial power. In his 1861 inaugural address, President Lincoln, sounding a Jeffersonian them e, said, “I do not forget the position assum ed by some, th at co nstitu tio nal q uestio ns are to be decid ed by th e Su prem e Co urt....” B. He cont inued, however, by observi ng, “At the sam e time, t he candi d ci tizen m ust confess t hat if the pol icy of the governm ent ... is to be irre vocably fixed by decisions of the Suprem e Court ... the people will have ceased to be their own rulers....” C. Th e im plicatio ns of th is p ositio n are sev eral. 1. First, the position recalls the Jeffersonian stan ce on institutional responsibility for constitutional interp retatio n— that o f departm entalism , in wh ich th e Co urt is n ot necessarily en tru sted with fin al authority to in terp ret th e Co nstitu tio n. 2. Second, it suggests, explicitly, that all actors take an oath to support the Constitution, and that oath does not m ean, necessarily, that other actors m ust accept the Court’s interpretation about what the Co nstitu tio n m ean s o r req uires. VIII. Th e Co nstitu tio n did not co ntain an ex plicit g uaran tee o f leg al eq uality u ntil, fo llo win g th e co nclusio n of th e Civil W ar, t he Fourt eent h Am endm ent was rat ified i n 1868. A. Aft er the war, C ongress adopt ed t he R econst ruct ion Am endm ent s—t he Thi rteent h, whi ch prohi bits slavery ; the Fourt eent h, whi ch guarant ees due proce ss of l aws and equal prot ect ion; and t he Fi fteent h, which provides that the right to vot e cannot be abridged on the basis of race, color, or previous condition of servi tude. B. The Fourteenth guarantees: “No State shall m ake or enforce any law whi ch shal l ... deny to any person ... the equal prot ect ion of t he law.” C ongressm an John B ingham , who draft ed i t, expl ained t hat the Fourt eent h Am endm ent rests on “the great dem ocratic idea that all men, before t he law, are equal in respect of t hose right s of person whi ch God gi ves and no m an m ay right ful ly take away ....” C.

In another series of decisions, the Court restricted the reach of the Fifteenth Am endm ent by upholding literacy tests, p oll tax es, an d wh ite p rim aries. II. In the infam ous case of Plessy v.

Hom er Pl essy , wi th the support of l ocal civil right s organi zat ions, brought a t est case to ch allen ge th e co nstitu tio nality o f th e law. A. Writin g fo r th e Co urt, Ju stice Bro wn said : The object of the am endm ent [the Fourteenth] was undoubtedly to enforce the ab solute equality of the two races before the law, but in the nature of things it could not have been intended to abolish distinctions based upon color, or to enforce soci al, as distinguished fro m political equality, or a com mingling of the two races upon te rm s unsatisfactory to either. B. Th e Co urt th us ag reed th at th e p urpose o f th e eq ual p rotectio n clau se was to guaran tee th e leg al eq uality o f the races. 1.

If this be so, it is not by reason of anything found in the act, but solely because the colored race chooses to put that const ruct ion upon i t. And likewise, “If one race be inferior to the other so cially, the Constitution of th e United States cannot put them on the sam e plane.” F. In a well-known dissent, Justice Harlan wrote, “[I]n view of the Constitution, in the eye of the law, there is in this country no superior, dom inant, ruling class of citizens... .

The hope was t hat the enormous co st to th e states o f providing genuinely eq ual facilities wo uld ev entually d estro y seg regatio n. C. The first significant victory for the NAACP LDF was in the im portant case of Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada (1938). M issouri , whi ch l acked a separat e law school for bl acks, had deni ed Gai nes, a bl ack m an, adm ission to its whites-only law school.

The C ourt found t his vi olated t he equal prot ect ion cl ause, but the deci sion di d not di rect ly chal lenge t he rulin g in Plessy . E. The NAACP continued its attack in Sweatt v. Pa inter (1950). In t his case, t he st ate of Texas m aintained a separat e law school for bl acks. Thi s time, t he NAACP i ntroduced expert testimony , foreshadowi ng Brown , that sep arate facilities were in heren tly u nequal, ev en if th e state o therwise eq ualized physical reso urces— whi ch, of course, i t had not done i n this case. F. Critical to the C ourt ’s opi nion and, event ually, to the end of Plessy was the Court’s willingness in this case to consider intangible inequalities be tween the two schools, such as di fferences in prestige and academ ic reput ation. IV. Sw eat t presaged the fall of separate but equal, but th e doctrine had not y et been discarded. The NAACP knew ful l wel l that segregat ion had a powerful em otional appeal fo r so me wh ites, esp ecially in the field of elem entary educat ion. A.

The Court also noted that the separa tion of children by race “generates a feeling of inferiority” in m inority school chi ldren “t hat m ay affect their heart s and m inds i n a way unl ikely ever t o be undone.” D. In a decision the following year, Brown II , the C ourt consi dered a quest ion i t had l eft open i n Brow n I : How were t he nat ion’s school s to implem ent Brow n I ?

Nearly 100 congressm en signed a resolution conde mning the decision as a “clear abuse of judicial power.” C. There was also m uch scholarly and academ ic criticism of the decision.

A. Th e Co urt ad dressed th is issu e th e fo llo win g year in Brow n II . Here, t he C ourt ordered school s to desegregate “with a ll deliberate speed.” B. Whatever t he intended m eani ng of t his vague com mand, in practice, it encouraged Southern states, in particu lar, to fin d ways to fo restall th eir co mplian ce. And, as a practical consequence, there are pockets of de f acto subst antial school segregat ion even t oday , though not de j ure discri minat ion. C.

Before Brown , m ost of t he C ourt ’s equal prot ect ion juri sprudence t ended t o focus on st atutory classi ficat ions that were cl earl y invi dious i n purpose or effect . A. Rem ember that the Court uses the co mpellin g state in terest test in cases where the classification is suspect. 1. Remember, under t he ol d Plessy rule, racial discrim ination woul d not offend the Constitution so long as it was ratio nal. 2. Under t he new t est, however, raci al di scri mination offends t he equal prot ect ion cl ause unl ess i t furthers a com pelling state interest. B. Affirm ative action program s, however, raise som ewhat different problem s because they seek to compensate fo r th e effects o f histo ric d iscrim inatio n ag ain st m inorities. 1. Do es th e “co mpensato ry” p urpose o f su ch program s co nstitu te a co mpellin g state in terest? 2. Alternat ively, does t he rem edial or beni gn purpose of t hese pol icies suggest the need for a speci al judi cial test under t he equal prot ect ion cl ause? C. The C ourt has st ruggl ed wi th these quest ions for m any years, and as we shal l see, judi cial effort s to deal with quest ions concerni ng affi rm ative act ion reopen i mport ant and recurrent quest ions about the m eani ng of equality and about the proper role of judges in a constitutional dem ocracy. 1. In ot her words, our quest ion becom es whet her affi rm ative act ion program s advance a com pelling st ate interest , or an i nterest so st rong t hat it overcom es t he di scri minat ion perpet rat ed by the program itself. 2. Behind t he doct rinal issue, of course, i s a t horny quest ion of m oral phi losophy and basi c just ice: When, if ever, is it perm issible for the st ate to discrim inate on the basis of race? III. Th e Co urt’s first su bstan tial effo rt to deal with th ese q uestio ns was in Reg ents o f th e Un iversity o f Ca lifo rnia v. Bakke (1978). A. Bakke, a whi te m an, was t wice deni ed adm issi on t o the m edical school at the Uni versi ty of C aliforni a at Davi s.

B. The Court concluded that the Davi s program was unconstitutional. But the Court did not say that race is alway s a prohi bited fact or i n adm issi ons deci sions. ©2006 The Teaching Com pany Lim ited Partnership 26"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":" C. Four just ices, i n an opi nion by Just ice St evens, argued t hat the pl an vi olated t he C ivil Right s Act of 1964 but did not reach the constitutional question. D. Four ot her just ices, i n an opi nion by Just ice B renna n, concl uded t hat the pl an sat isfied bot h t he C ivil Right s Act and t he equal prot ect ion cl ause. Just ice B rennan argued t hat affi rm ative act ions i n general shoul d not be subject to strict scrut iny but , instead, hel d to a l ess dem andi ng “i nterm ediate” st andard. E. The critical opinion in the case was a concurrence by Ju stice Powell, who agreed w ith the Stevens bloc that the pl an vi olated t he C ivil Right s Act . But Powel l also concl uded t hat the pl an was a vi olation of t he Fourt eent h Am endm ent . F. In Powell’s view, a program that prefers “m em bers of any one group for no reason other than race or eth nic o rigin” is d iscrim inatio n “fo r its o wn sak e” an d unconstitu tio nal. 1. He not ed, t oo, t hat not withstandi ng t he al leged purpose of t he program , “i t m ay not alway s be cl ear that a so-called ‘preference’ is benign.” 2. Continuing, he argued, “Nothing in the Constitution supports the notion that individuals m ay be asked to suffer ot herwi se imperm issi ble burdens si mply to enhance t he soci etal standi ng of ot hers.” 3. Powel l went on: “Second, preferent ial program s m ay onl y rei nforce com mon st ereot ypes hol ding t hat certain groups are unable to achieve success w ithout special protecti on.” He continued: By h itch ing th e m ean ing of th e Eq ual Pro tectio n Clau se to th ese tran sito ry co nsideratio ns, we wo uld be holding, as a co nstitu tio nal p rincip le, th at j udicial scru tin y o f classificatio ns to uching on racial and ethnic backgrounds m ay vary depending on the ebb a nd flow of political forces. G. Nevertheless, Justice Powell did not say that th e use of race in university adm issions is always unconstitutional. Som etim es, he wrote, race m ay be a “plus” in an applicant’s file. H. Final ly, Just ice Powel l, unl ike the B rennan bl oc, argued that raci al di scri minat ion i s alway s m alignant and, hence, m ust be judged by the st rict scrut iny test. IV. Much like Brown before it, Bakke in itiated a fierce d ebate o ver th e m erits an d co nstitu tio nality o f affirm ativ e act ion pl ans. A. In a seri es of deci sions handed down bet ween 1978 and 1995, t he C ourt seem ed unabl e to agree on even the m ost basi c ki nds of quest ions. M uch of t he debat e cent ered on whet her “beni gn” racial classifications shoul d be subject ed t o the sam e scrut iny as i nvi dious cl assi ficat ions. B. For exam ple, t he C ourt rul ed t hat strict scrut iny shoul d be appl ied t o affi rm ative act ion program s adopt ed by city and st ate governm ents but seem ed t o suggest that the less dem andi ng i nterm edi ate standard was appropri ate for program s adopt ed by the federal governm ent. C. In m ost of t hese cases, t he C ourt seem ed t o argue about m atters of doct rine—t he just ices, i n ot her words, argued about whet her t hey shoul d appl y strict scrut iny or an i nterm edi ate standard of revi ew. V. Two cases decided in 2003 m ay finally have settled the doctrinal issues, but they will do little to settle the underlying constitutional and ethical issues that su rround affirm ative action. A. Befo re we tak e up th ese cases in detail, it is im portan t to rem ember th at th ese ap paren t doctrin al d isputes mask m ore fundam ental disagreem ents about the m ean ing and nature of equality as a constitutional ideal. 1. For exam ple, one m ight understand equality as a com mitm ent to equality of opportunity. 2. Alternatively, we m ight understand the concept as a com mitm ent to a substantive equality of condition or posi tion. 3. We should ask how these alternative understandings about the m eaning of equality influence our approach t o affi rm ative act ion program s. B. In Gru tter v. Bo llin ger (2003), t he fi rst of t wo cases prom pted by affi rm ative act ion program s at the Uni versi ty of M ichi gan, t he C ourt rul ed 5–4 t hat strict scrut iny appl ies to all affi rm ative act ion program s. 1. Nevertheless, the Court upheld the constitutionality of the law school’s program , because the program was “n arro wly tailo red ” to ach iev e a co mpellin g state in terest in th e attain ment of racial d iversity. 2. Un lik e th e in flex ible p rogram in Bakke , the C ourt rul ed, t he law school program was “hi ghl y indi vidual ized” and “gave seri ous consi derat ion t o all the ways an applicant m ight contribute to a diverse educat ional envi ronm ent .” ©2006 The Teaching Com pany Lim ited Partnership 27"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" 3.

In th is lectu re, we tak e up one su ch area—th at o f discri minat ion on t he basi s of gender. Di scri minat ion on t he basi s of sex has a l ong hi story in the Uni ted States. Throughout m uch of t hat hi story , the C ourt has t aken a hands-off approach, rul ing on m ore t han one occasion that discrim ination on the ba sis of gender did not vi olate equal protection unless it was arbitrary or i rrat ional . In 1971, however, t he C ourt began t o re view gender di scri minat ion m ore aggressi vel y. Hence, in Reed v. Reed (1971), the Court found unconstitutional an Ida ho statute preferring m en to wom en in the adm inistration of a decedent’s esta te. Just two years later, in Front iero v. Ri chardson (1973), a plurality of the Court suggested that gender should be treated like race and, thus, subject to strict scrutiny as a suspect classification. Later Courts, however , proved reluctant to em brace strict scrutiny for gender classifications. Outline I. I suggest ed i n Lect ure Thi rty-Two t hat Gru tter and Gratz m ay h ave settled so me of th e d octrin al issu es in th e debat e over affi rm ative act ion. A. Bu t ev en so , affirm ativ e actio n still g ives rise to a wid e variety o f co nstitu tio nal co ncern s. B. For exam ple, i n hi s import ant di ssent in Gru tter , Just ice Thom as wrot e, quot ing Frederi ck Dougl ass, “‘W hat I ask for t he negro i s not benevol ence, not pi ty, not sy mpathy, but simply just ice.’” He cont inued: “Li ke Dougl ass, I bel ieve bl acks can achi eve i n every avenue of Am eri can l ife wi thout the m eddl ing of uni versi ty adm inistrat ors.” C. Anot her poi nt of cont roversy concerns Just ice O’C onnor’s opi nion i n Gru tter , where she wrote: “It has been 25 years since Justice Powell first approved the us e of race to further an interest in student body diversity....” Sh e co ntin ued: “W e ex pect th at 2 5 years fro m now, th e u se o f racial p referen ces will n o longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.” D. Just ice Thom as responded: “I agree wi th the C ourt ’s hol ding t hat raci al di scri minat ion i n hi gher educat ion adm issions will be illegal in 25 years.... I believe that the Law School’s current use of race violates the Equal Protection Clause and that the Constitution m eans the sam e thing today as it will in 300 m onths.” II. Like classifications based on race, gender classifications ha ve a long history in the United States. And, as with raci al classi ficat ions, for a l ong t ime, Am eri can court s refused t o recogni ze t hat gender cl assi ficat ions oft en do little m ore th an restate an d reify o utdated an d pernicio us stereo typ es. A. In Bradw ell v. St ate of Illinoi s (1873), for exam ple, t he C ourt uphel d the st ate’s rul e that prohi bited wom en fro m practicin g law. Ju st two years later, th e Co urt p erem ptorily d ism issed th e claim th at wo men have a constitu tio nal rig ht to vote in Mi nor v. Happerset t (1875). B. Women achi eved t he ri ght to vot e in 1920 wi th the adopt ion of t he Ni net eent h Am endm ent , but , in m ost ways, wo men were still su bject to unequal treatm ent in th e law. In Hoyt v. Florida (1961), for exam ple, t he Court unani mousl y rul ed t hat a Fl ori da law prohi biting wom en from servi ng on juri es di d not vi olate the equal prot ect ion cl ause. C. Like i ts cases on raci al di scri minat ion, t he C ourt ’s ear ly gender cases often seem ed to reflect larger social and cultural understandings about the m ean ing of race or gender in society. D. The Court’s treatm ent of gender cases is sim ilar to th e Court’s treatm ent of race in another respect as well: Both lines of cases involve im portant questions a bout the m eaning of equality and about the lim its of judi cial power. E. The Court’s gender cases, then, like its race cases, of ten turn on disputes about when and why the Court ought to upset deci sions undert aken by popul arl y elect ed l egislatures. III. The C ourt ’s m odern gender cases begi n i n 1971, i n the case of Reed v. Reed (1971). A. In Reed , a unanim ous Court found unconstitutional an Ida ho statute preferring m en to wom en in the adm inistration of a decedent’s estate. ©2006 The Teaching Com pany Lim ited Partnership 29"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":" B. In i ts deci sion, t he C ourt sai d simply that the Idaho l aw was “t he very ki nd of arbi trary legislative choi ce forbidden” by the Constitution. Im plicit, of course, is an understanding about the reach of judicial power vis-à-vi s the legislature. 1. The C ourt ’s use of t he word arbi trary m ight suggest that this part icular st atute woul d fai l to sat isfy even th e b asic ratio nality test. 2. But there are ot her part s of t he opi nion t hat seem to cal l for a hi gher degree of judi cial scrut iny. IV. Left unspecified in Reed was the doctrinal question of whether ge nder classifications, like race, should be subject to strict scrutiny. A. The C ourt took up t he doct rinal quest ion i n Front iero v. Ri chardson (1973). In t his case, t he C ourt inval idated a federal law deny ing servi cewom en benefi ts gi ven t o m ales. B.

W e agree....” 1. Thi s woul d m ean t hat gender cl assi ficat ions woul d be subject to the st rict scrut iny/com pelling st ate interest test. 2. However, the standard was a dopted only by a plurality of the Court, not a m ajority. C. Before we t ake up t he ot her opi nions i n the case, we shoul d consi der why som e classi ficat ions m ight be suspect—we should, in other words, tr y to identify the reasons that m ake a classification, such as race, suspect, then determ ine whether those reasons a ppl y wi th equal force t o gender cl assi ficat ions. 1. The Court has often said, first, that racial classifications are suspect because there is a long history of raci al di scri minat ion in th e Un ited States. 2. Racial classifications are also susp ect, the Court has ruled, because it is difficult to im agine situations in whi ch t he st ate m ight di scri minat e for reasons t hat are not stereot ypical or i nvi dious. 3. The Court has also argued that race is an im mutabl e characteristic, one that cannot be changed and one that is bey ond t he cont rol of t he indi vidual . D. Part o f th e p lurality o pinion in Fro ntiero is dedi cat ed t o a di scussi on of whet her and t o what ext ent these sam e consi derat ions appl y to gender discri minat ion. Just ice B rennan st ated: “W ith th ese co nsideratio ns in mind, we can onl y concl ude t hat classi ficat ions based on sex are i nherent ly suspect , and m ust, therefore, be subjected to strict judicial scrutiny.” E. Justices Po well, Black mun, an d Stewart ag reed th at th e d enial in th is case was u nconstitu tio nal b ut disagreed wi th the st atem ent that gender cl assi ficat ions shoul d be suspect and, t hus, t ested agai nst strict scru tin y. F. Justice Powell also argued that th e plurality’s decision was ill tim ed, because the Equal Rights Am endm ent was still pending in the states: “The Equal Rights Am endm ent, which if adopted will resolve the substance of this precise question, has been approved by the Congress and subm itted for ratification by the States.” If passed, he noted, “It will represen t the will of the people accom plished in the m anner prescribed by the Constitution.” If not, judges would be well advised to follow m ajoritari an sentim ents unless they are irrat ional or arbi trary . He concl uded: “B y act ing pr em aturely and unnecessarily, as I view it, the Court assum ed a decisional responsibility at the very tim e when state legislatures , functioning within the tradi tional dem ocrat ic process, are debat ing t he proposed Am endm ent .” G.

Moreover, it should rem ind us that constitutional interpre tation always involves an elem ent of judgm ent . Outline I. As we saw in Lectu re Th irty-Th ree, a p lurality o f th e Co urt in Reed argued t hat classi ficat ions based on gender ought to receive strict scrutiny. A. A m ajority o f th e Co urt, h owever, n ever ag reed to su ch a ru le. Ultim ately, th ose justices arg uing fo r th e middl e ground—Powel l, Blackm un, St ewart , and St evens—m anaged t o persuade a m ajori ty of t he C ourt to rej ect th e p lurality o pinion in Reed , as wel l as t he di ssent ing posi tion occupi ed by Just ice R ehnqui st. B. In Craig v. Boren (1976), a m ajority settled on an interm edia te test for gender cl assifications. Calling gender classifications quasi - or sem i-suspect, the Court announced: “To withstand constitutional challenge, previ ous cases est ablish t hat classi ficat ions by ge nder m ust serve i mport ant governm ental object ives and must be subst antially rel ated t o achi evem ent of t hose object ives.” 1. The C ourt thus adopt ed what we som etimes cal l an i nterm edi ate-tier revi ew. Thi s interm edi ate tier, reserv ed fo r “sem i-” o r “q uasi-” su spect classes, req uires m ore th an ratio nality b ut does n ot req uire that the state’s interest be com pelling. 2. In th is p articu lar case, th e Co urt co ncluded th at th e state in terest co uld not pass th is in term ediate test. C. Cra ig poi nts to anot her i ssue t hat hi des behi nd t he quest ion regardi ng st andards of revi ew. The discri minat ion i n Cra ig was di rect ed agai nst m ales. Is t his ki nd of di scri minat ion di fferent , as a constitu tio nal m atter, th an discrim inatio n ag ain st wo men? 1. We m ight , in general , attempt to di stingui sh bet ween suspect classes and suspect cla ssifica tio ns . 2. Discrim ination against a suspect class would encom pass discrim ination, for exam ple, against trad itio nally d isfav ored m inorities—su ch as African Am erican s, o ne m ight arg ue, o r wo men. If we adopt this approach, we m ight well decide that th ere is an im portant constitutional difference between discri minat ion di rect ed agai nst wom en and t hat di rect ed agai nst m en. 3. Altern ativ ely, we m ight be m ore co ncern ed with su spect classificatio ns—o r classificatio ns th at u tilize race or gender no m atter who is harm ed or helped. In such cases, we m ight argue, the constitutional harm consi sts in the very use of a raci al or gender classification. In these cas es, the sam e standard of revi ew shoul d appl y no m atter the purpose or t he effect of t he cl assi ficat ion. D. In an i mport ant concurrence, Just ice Stevens objected to the new test. “The re i s,” he wrot e, “onl y one equal prot ect ion cl ause. It requi res every St ate to govern i mpartially. It does not di rect the court s to appl y one standard of revi ew i n som e cases and a di fferent standard i n ot her cases.” E. In di ssent , Just ice R ehnqui st argued t hat the m ajori ty deci sion was “object ionabl e on t wo grounds.” 1. First , Rehnqui st not ed t hat the di scri minat ion i n this case was di rect ed agai nst m en. 2. Second, R ehnqui st object ed t o the enunci ation of t he new st andard “wi thout citation t o any source.” In addi tion, Just ice R ehnqui st observed t hat the test was suffi cient ly elast ic to allow, i ndeed, woul d necessitate judges to m ake “subjective judgm ents” that are best left to the political branches. ©2006 The Teaching Com pany Lim ited Partnership 32"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":" II.

A series of cases decided after Cra ig seem s to dem onstrate the “accord ion-like” character of the test. B. In Mi chael M. v. Superi or C ourt of Sonoma C ount y (1981), Chief Justice Rehnqui st, writing for a plurality, upheld the constitutionality of a statutory rape law that punished m ales for e ngaging in unlawful sexual intercourse wi th underage fem ales but not fem ales so engaged wi th underage m ales. 1. Accordi ng t o Chief Just ice R ehnqui st, the law was subst antially rel ated t o the st ate’s st rong i nterest in preventin g illeg itim ate teen age p regnancies. 2. Just ices B rennan, W hite, and M arshal l di ssent ed, argui ng t hat the law was based on “out moded sexual stereotypes.” C. In Mi ssi ssi ppi Uni versi ty for Women v. Hogan (1982), on t he ot her hand, t he C ourt struck down an adm issi ons pol icy that excl uded m ales from ent ering t he nursi ng school . D. Although he norm ally vot ed wi th Just ices B rennan, W hite, and M arshal l, this time, Just ice B lackm un dissen ted, writin g, “I h ave co me to su spect th at it is easy to go to o far with rig id ru les in th is area o f claimed sex di scri minat ion.” E. In a second uni versi ty-rel ated case, Un ited States v. Virg inia (1996), t he C ourt inval idated t he Vi rgi nia Military In stitu te’s m ales-o nly ad missio ns policy. 1. Writin g fo r th e m ajority, Ju stice Gin sburg rej ected VMI’s claim th at its sin gle-sex in stitu tio n contributed to diversity in educa tional approaches, largely because the state had not provided sim ilar educational opportunities for wom en. 2.

Ginsburg’s l anguage i s a bi t confusi ng: Schol ars wonder i f this is simply a rest atem ent of t he m iddl e tier o r wh eth er it wo rks a su bstan tial ch ange in th e test. 4. Just ice Gi nsburg al so addressed t he underl ying di scri minat ion, not ing, “However l iberal ly this pl an serves t he st ate’s sons, i t m akes no provi sion what ever for her daught ers. That is not equal prot ect ion.” 5. In an im portan t dissen t, Ju stice Scalia raised a n umber o f fam iliar issu es. He b egan by notin g, “To day, the Co urt sh uts d own an in stitu tio n th at h as serv ed th e p eople o f th e Co mmonwealth of Virg inia with pri de and di stinction for over a cent ury and a hal f.” He cont inued, “M uch of t he C ourt ’s opi nion i s devot ed t o deprecat ing t he cl osed-m indedness of our forebears wi th regard t o wom en’s educat ion.

Justice Scalia also addressed th e issue of l evel s of revi ew: I have no probl em wi th a sy stem of abst ract tests such as rat ional basi s, i nterm edi ate, and st rict scrut iny (though I t hink we can do bet ter than appl ying st rict scrut iny and i nterm edi ate scrut iny whenever we feel like it). Such form ulas are essential to evalua ting whet her t he new rest rictions that a changi ng soci ety const antly imposes upon pri vate conduct com port wi th that “equal protection” our society has always accorded in the past.

Scope: The Court’s equal protection jurisp rudence extends far beyond race a nd gender. In the early 1970s, for exam ple, t he C ourt began t o revi ew cases i nvol ving resi dent aliens and t hose i nvol ving cl assi ficat ions based on econom ic status. In bot h, t he C ourt refused t o appl y strict scrut iny. As we shal l see i n this lect ure, the C ourt has l ikewi se refused t o ext end st rict scrut iny to cases i nvol ving di scri minat ion on t he basi s of sexual orientation, m ental or physi cal incapacity, illegitim acy, and age. And although the justices continue to bi cker over st andards of revi ew, t here does app ear to be an overarching trend: Except for cases involving race and gender, the Court’s ge neral posture in equal protection cas es is that of deference to the majori tarian preferences expressed t hrough t he dem ocrat ic process. Outline I. As we saw i n Lect ures Thi rty-Two t hrough Thi rty-Four , one of t he defi ning feat ures of t he C ourt ’s equal prot ect ion juri sprudence has been t he ext ensi on of t he cl ause bey ond cases t hat turn on raci al classi ficat ions t o other areas of di scri minat ion, i ncludi ng gender. A. We saw, t oo, t hat the C ourt has devel oped an equa l prot ect ion juri sprudence t hat is const ruct ed around t he not ion t hat di fferent ki nds of cl assi ficat ions wa rrant di fferent degrees of judi cial scrut iny. B. At this poi nt in the course, we appear t o have t hree t iers of revi ew: 1. For so-called suspect classifications, such as race, the Court uses strict scrutiny. 2. For sem i-suspect classi ficat ions, such as gender, t he C ourt uses t he interm edi ate test, whi ch requi res the state to ad vance an im portan t an d su bstan tial in terest. 3. For nonsuspect classifications, th e Court uses the rationality test. II. In this lecture, we take up cases involving the equal protec tion clause and classifica tions based on disability, econom ic status, age, sexual ori entation, and al ienage. A. In each of these areas, the Court ha s considered a fam iliar question: W hat standard of review—strict, interm edi ate, or rat ional basi s—shoul d i t use t o assess t he st ate’s act ion? B. We shall see, too, that som e justices appear anxious to replace the “tier” analysis with som e other set of doct rinal tool s. III. In Harper v. Vi rgi nia Board of El ect ions (1966), t he C ourt not ed, “l ines drawn on t he basi s of weal th or property, like those of race ... are traditionally disfavored.” A. Such l anguage m ight suggest that weal th classi ficat ions are suspect , but it is import ant to not e that the Court had not yet ful ly art iculated t he concept s of t iers of revi ew. B. Whatever the im port of Harper , in the leading case of San Ant oni o v. Rodri guez (1973), t he C ourt decl ared that econom ic classi ficat ions are subject onl y to the rat ional basi s test. San Ant oni o is an im portan t case, in large m easure because the m ajority devoted a good d eal of discussion to i ssues about constitutional interp retatio n an d th e lim its o f judicial p ower. 1. Thi s case i nvol ved a Texas schem e for t he fundi ng of publ ic school s that was a com plicat ed m ix of local propert y taxes and st ate subsi dies. The pl aintiffs chal lenged t he schem e, cl aiming t hat impoveri shed school di stricts suffered di scri minat ion based on t heir fi nanci al status. 2. Just ice Powel l concl uded t hat the econom ic classi ficat ion i nvol ved i n the case di d not trigger heightened judicial scru tin y an d m ust, in stead , b e su bject to th e ratio nality test. 3. Po well n oted th at it was d ifficu lt in th is case to attach an y certain ty to th e “class” h arm ed by th e financi ng schem e. W eal th classi ficat ions, he argued, are perm eable, and such concepts as poor and poverty are inherently subjective. 4. In addi tion, Just ice Powel l argued t hat, unl ike ot her equal prot ect ion cases, here t here was “no absolute d eprivatio n” of th e in terest claim ed. Th e claim , in stead , was th at th e q uality o f ed ucatio n suffered , not th at th ere was a d enial alto gether o f th e lib erty in terest. 5. For Powel l, then, t he case reduced t o the quest ion: Is t he school propert y fundi ng sy stem “rat ional ” in a co nstitu tio nal sen se?

In Romer v. Evans (1996), the Court did strike an am endm ent to the Colorado Constitution that barred local governm ents from enforci ng regul ations t hat grant ed prot ect ed m inori ty status t o hom osexual s. A. But the C ourt di d not find t hat sexual ori entation t riggered hi gher scrut iny under t he equal prot ect ion clau se.

In th is case, h owever, th e ratio nality test seem ed to req uire m ore th an it h ad in th e p ast. On ce ag ain , th e Court’s equal protection analysis ra ised issues about the tier analysis and the integrity of constitutional interp retatio n. V. In Tri mble v. Gordon (1977), the Court invalidated an Illinois st atute that disadvantaged nonm arital children. Th e Co urt refu sed to utilize strict scru tin y fo r th is classificatio n, but it d id seem to utilize th e in term ediate standard of revi ew. VI. The C ourt consi dered cl assi ficat ions based on m ental handi cap i n the case of Cleburne v. C leburne Li ving Cen ter (1985). A. The C ourt struck a resi dent ial zoni ng rest riction t hat di scri minat ed agai nst the m entally handi capped. B. Writin g fo r th e Co urt, Ju stice W hite said , “W e co nclude, for several reasons, t hat the court of appeal s erred in hol ding m ental ret ardat ion a quasi -suspect classi ficat ion.” 1. Thi s represent s a cl ear deci sion t o put the cl assi ficat ion i nto the nonsuspect cat egory , thus t riggeri ng ratio nality rev iew. 2. One of t he reasons for t his deci sion i s the fol lowing observat ion by the C ourt : Because m ental retardation is a characteristic that the governm ent m ay legitim ately take into account in a wide range of d ecisions, and because both State and Federal governm ents have recently com mitted them selves to assisting the retarded, we w ill not presum e that any given leg islativ e actio n ... is ro oted in co nsideratio ns th at th e Co nstitu tio n will n ot to lerate.” 3. Interestin gly, h owever, h aving estab lish ed th at ratio nality is th e co rrect test, th e Co urt co ncluded: “Th e short o f it is th at req uirin g th e p erm it in th is case ap pears to us to rest o n an irratio nal p rejudice ag ain st the m entally retard ed.” C. Although the Court applied the rationa lity test, m any observers thought th e test, in its application, was clo ser to in term ediate scru tin y. D. An y am biguity in Cleburne , h owever, was settled in Heller v. Doe (1993), i n whi ch t he C ourt , in an opinion by Justice Ke nnedy, clearly applied the rationality test in upholding a Kentuc ky statute providing for the involuntary com mitm ent of m entally ill persons. VII. Fin ally, in Massachusetts Board of Retirement v. Murgia (1977), t he C ourt uphel d a st ate law t hat requi red police officers to retire at age 50. A. Th e Co urt ag ain utilized th e ratio nality stan dard, n otin g th at a su spect class is o ne “sad dled with su ch disab ilities, o r su bjected to su ch a h isto ry o f purposefu l unequal treatm ent, o r releg ated to su ch a p ositio n of political p owerlessn ess as to co mmand ex trao rdinary p rotectio n fro m th e m ajoritarian political p rocess.” B.

Two trends em erge from this com plicated thicket of cases. A. First, as a g eneral ru le, th e Co urt h as p roven unwillin g at all to ad d to th e categ ory o f su spect classificatio ns. Th e Co urt h as p roven alm ost as u nwillin g to ad d to th e categ ory o f sem i-su spect.

Other justices, notably Justice Marsha ll, have agreed t hat a t wo-t ier or t hree-t ier approach i s “out dat ed and intellectually disingenuous.” W riting in Murgia , Marshall called for a “sliding-scale” approach, in which the standard of review would be specifically tailored for each case, co mmensurate with the nature of the classi ficat ion and t he burden i t imposes on t he indi vidual . D. In sharp contrast, Justice Stevens has argued i nstead for a si ngl e st andard of revi ew t o appl y in all equal prot ect ion cases. As we saw i n Cra ig , Ju stice Stev ens u rged th e ad optio n of a sin gle stan dard of ratio nality. In Cleburne , however, he suggested that the ra tionality test m ight have m ore bite than it has had in the past: “th e wo rd ‘ratio nal’—fo r m e at least—in clu des elem ents o f leg itim acy an d neutrality.” E.

B. If we are to resolve such cases in ways faithful to the Constitution, then, we need som e understanding of the entire Constitution and som e understanding of the valu es it seeks to advance. Cases cannot be resolved by simple appeal s to one provi sion or anot her or by taking provi sions and cases out of cont ext . III. As we have seen, som e issues seem to tr anscend specific cases and controversies. A.

In m any in stan ces, th ese two values seem to pull in different di rect ions. B ut they also poi nt to a shared value, because behind both values is a vision of the hum an person th at stresses our equal m oral worth and our shared hum an di gni ty. C.

Alternatively, som e understandings, perhaps closer to the Frankfurter position and to departm ental theories of constitutional interpretation, suggest that constitutional values are best preserved when citizens have an ongoing and direct sense of res ponsibility for the Constitution.
