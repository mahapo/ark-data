W e read Am erican books and saw American film s, and a common phrase in those days was \"to be as rich and as wise as an A merican\". What happened?\" 2 An American m ight have been asked som ething sim ilar by a Guate malan, an Indonesian or a Cuban during the ten years previous, or by a Uruguayan, a Chilean or a Greek in the decade sub sequent. Th e rem arkable internation al goodwill and credib ility enjoyed by the United States at the clos e of the Second World W ar was dissipated country-by-country, intervention-by-interve ntion. The opportunity to build the war- ravaged world anew, to lay the foun dations fo r peace, p rosp erity and jus tice, co llaps ed under the awful weight of anti-com munis m. The weight had been accum ulating for som e tim e; indeed, since Day One of the Russian Revolution. By the summer of 1918 som e 13,000 Am erican troops could be found in the newly-born Union of Soviet So cialist Republics. Two years and thousands of casualties late r, the A merican troo ps lef t, having failed in their m ission to \"strangle at its birth \" the Bolshevik s tate, as W inston Church ill pu t it. 3 The young Churchill was Great Britain' s Minister for W ar and Air during this period. Increasingly, it was he who directed the invasion of the Soviet Union by the Allies (Grea t Britain, the US, France, Japan an d severa l othe r nations ) on the side of th e counter-revolutionary \"White Ar my\". Years later, Churchill the historian was to record his views of this singular affair for posterity: Were t hey [the Allies] at war with Sov iet Ru ssia ? Certain ly n ot; bu t th ey sho t So viet Russi ans at sight . The y stood as i nvaders on Russi an s oil. They armed t he enem ies of t he Sovi et G overnm ent. The y bl ocka ded i ts port s, a nd sun k its battlesh ips. They earn estly d esired and sch emed its d ownfall. Bu t war—sh ocking! Interfere nce—sham e! It was , they re peated , a m atter of indiffe rence to them how Ru ssian s settled th eir own intern al affai rs. Th ey were im partial—Ban g! 4 What was there about this Bolshevik Revolution that so alarm ed the m ost powerful nations in the world? W hat drove the m to invade a land whose soldie rs had recen tly fought alongsid e them for over three years and suffered m ore casualties th an any other country on either side of the W orld W ar? The Bolsheviks had had the audacity to m ake a separate p eace with G erm any in order to take leave of a war they regarded as imperialist and not in any way their war, and to try and rebuild a terribly weary and devastated Russia. But the Bolsheviks had displayed the far greater audacity of ove rthr owing a capita list- feudal system and procla im ing the first soc ialist sta te in the history of the world. Th is was uppityness writ incred ibly large. This was th e crim e the Allies h ad to punish, the viru s which had to b e eradicated lest it spread to their own people. 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The invasion did not achieve its imm ediate purpose, but its consequences were nonetheless profound and persist to the present day. P rofessor D.F. Flem ing, the Vanderbilt University h istor ian of the Cold W ar, has noted: Fo r th e Am erican peop le t he co sm ic trag edy o f th e i nterven tio ns in Ru ssia do es not exist, or i t was a n uni mportant incident long forgot ten.

W e do know, however, the nature of a Soviet Unio n attacked in its crad le, raised alon e in an extr em ely hostile world, and, when it m anaged to survive to adulthood, overrun by the Nazi war machine with the blessings of the W estern powers. The resulting in securities an d fears have inevitably led to deform ities of character not unlike that found in an individual raised in a sim ilar life- threatening m anner. We in the West are never allowed to forg et the political shortcom ings (real and bogus) of t he Soviet Union; at the sa me time we are never rem inded of the history which lies behind it. The anti-communist prop aganda cam paign began even earlier than the m ilitary interven tio n. Before th e year 1918 was over, express ions in the vein of \"Red Peril\", \"the Bolsh evik assau lt on civi lization\", and \"m enace to world by Reds is seen\" had becom e commonplace in the pages of the New York Times . During Feb ruary an d March 1919 , a US Senate Jud iciary Subcommittee held heatings before which many \"Bolshevik horror stories \" were presented. The character of som e of the testim ony c an be gauged by the headline in the usually sedate Times of 12 February 1919: DESCRIBE HORRORS UNDER RED RULE. R.E. S IMONS AND W .W.

Historian Frederick Lewis Schum an has writt en: \"The net result of these hearings ... was to picture Soviet Russ ia as a kind of bedlam inhabited by abject slaves com pletely at th e m ercy of an organ izati on of hom icidal m aniacs whose purpose was to destroy all traces of civi lization and carry th e nation back to b arbarism .\" 7 Liter ally no story abou t the Bolsh eviks was too contrived, too bizarre, too grotesque, or too perverted to be printed and widely believed—from wom en being nationalized to babies being ea ten (as the early pagans believ ed the Christians guilty of devouring their children; the sam e was believed of the jews in the Middle Ages). The story about wom en with all the lurid c onnotations of state property, com pulsory 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"marriage, \"f ree love\", etc. \"was b road casted over the country through a thousand channels,\" wrote Schum an, \"and perhaps did more than anything else to stam p the Russian Communists in the m inds of m ost American citizens as crim inal perv erts \". 8 This tale continued to receive g reat currency even after the State Departm ent was obliged to announce that it was a fraud. (That th e Soviets eat their babies was still being taught by the John Birch Society to its la rge audience at leas t as late as 1978.) 9 By the end of 1919, when the defeat of th e Allies and the White Arm y appeared like ly, the New York Times treated its readers to headli nes and sto ries such as the following: 30 Dec . 1919: \"Reds See k War W ith Am erica\" 9 Ja n. 1920: \"' Official qua rtets' describe the Bolshe vist m enace in the Middle East as om inous\" 11 Jan . 19 20 : \"Allied officials and diplomats [env isag e] a possib le inv asion of Eu rop e\" 13 Jan . 19 20 : \"Allied diplomatic circles\" fear an invasion of Persia 16 Ja n. 1920: A page -one he adl ine, ei ght co lumns wi de: \"Britain Facing War With Red s, Calls C ouncil In Paris.\" \"Well-inform ed di plom ats\" expect both a m ilitary inva sion of E urope an d a S oviet adva nce i nto Eastern a nd S outher n Asi a. Th e following m orning , ho wev er, we co uld read : \"No War With Russia, Allies To Trad e With Her\" 7 Fe b. 1920: \"Reds R aising Arm y To At tack India\" 11 Feb . 19 20 : \"Fear Th at B olsh eviki Will No w In vad e Japan ese Territ ory\" Readers of the New York Times were ask ed to believ e tha t all the se invasion s were to co me from a nation tha t was shatte red as few nations in history have been; a nation still recovering from a horrendous world war; in extreme chaos from a funda mental social revolution that w as barely off the ground; engage d in a brutal civil war against forces backed by the m ajor pow ers of the world; its industries, never advanced to begin with, in a sham bles; and th e country in the throes of a fa mine t hat was to leav e m any m illio ns dead bef ore it subsid ed. In 1920, Th e New Repu blic m agazine presented a lengthy analysis of the news coverage by the New York Times of the Russian Revolution and the intervention. Am ongst much else, it observed that in th e tw o years following the Nove mber 1917 revolution, the Times had sta ted no less than 91 tim es that \"the Sovi ets were n earing their rope' s end or ac tually had reached it.\" 10 If this was reality as presented by th e United States' \"newspaper of record\", one can im agine only with dism ay the witch' s brew the rest of the nation' s newspapers w ere feeding to th eir readers. This, then, was the Am erican people' s first experien ce of a new social phenom enon that had com e upon the world, their introductory education about the Soviet Union and this thing called \"comm unism \". The students have never recovered from the lesson. Neither has the Soviet Union. The m ilitary inte rventio n cam e to an end but, with the sole and par tial exception of the Second W orld War period, the propa ganda offensive has never let up. In 1943 Life m agazine devoted an entire issue in honor of the Soviet Union' s ac com plishm ents, going fat beyond what was dem anded by the need for wartim e solidarity, going so far as to call Len in \"perh aps the grea test ma n of mo dern time s\". 11 Two years later, however, with Harry Trum an sitting in the W hite House, such f rate rnity ha d no chanc e of surviving. T rum an, after all, was the m an who, the day after the Nazis invad ed the Soviet Union, said: \"If we s ee that Germ any is winning, we ought to help Russia, and i f Russia is winning, we ought to help Germ any, and that way let them kill as m any as possible, although I don't want to s ee Hitle r victo rious in any circum stances.\" 12 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Much propaganda m ileage has been squeezed ou t of the Sov iet-Germ an treaty of 1939, m ade possible only by entirely ignoring th e fact that the Russians were force d into th e pac t by the rep eated ref usal of th e W estern powers, particularly the United States and Great Britain, to unite with Mosco w in a stan d agains t Hitler; 13 as th ey likewise ref used to com e to the aid of th e socialist-oriented Spanish governm ent under siege by the Germ an, Italian and Spanish fasc ists beginning in 1936. St alin realized that if the W est wouldn' t save Spain, they cer tainly wouldn' t save the Soviet Union. From the Red Scare of the 1920s to the McCarthyism of the 1950s to the Reagan Crusade against the Evil Em pire of the 1980s , the Am erican people have been subjected to a relentless anti- communist indoctrination. It is im bibe d with their mother' s m ilk, pictured in their com ic books, spelled out in their school books; their daily paper offe rs them headlines that tell them all they n eed to know; m inisters find serm ons in it, politicians a te elected with it, and Reader's Digest becom es rich on it. The fiercely-held conviction inevitably produced by this insidious assault upon the intellect is that a gr eat dam nation has been unleas hed upon the w orld, possibly by the devil him self, but in the form of peopl e; p eople no t m otivated by the sam e needs, feats, em otions, and personal m orality th at go vern others of the species, but people engaged in a n extrem ely cleve r, m onolith ic, in ter nationa l con spiracy ded icated to taking over the world and enslaving i t; for reasons no t always clear perhaps, but evil needs no motivation s ave evil its elf. Moreove r, any appearance o r claim by these people to be rational hum an beings seeking a better kind of world or society is a sham , a cover-up, to delude others, and proof only of their clev erness; th e rep ression and cruelties which have tak en place in th e Soviet Unio n are fore ver proof of th e bankr uptcy of virtue and the evil intentions of these people in whichever country they m ay be found, under whatever nam e they m ay call them selves : and, most im portant of all, the only choice open to anyone in the United Sta tes is betwe en the Am erican W ay of Life and the Soviet W ay of Life, that nothing lies betw een or beyond these two ways of m aking t he world. This is how it looks to the simple fo lk of Am erica. One finds that the sophisticated, when pro bed slightly beneat h the surface of th eir academ ic languag e, see it exa ctly th e sam e way. To the m ind carefully brought to adulthood in the United States, the truths of anti- communis m are self-evident, as self -evident as the flatness o f the world once was to an earlier m ind; as the Russian people believed tha t the v ictims of Stalin' s purges wer e truly guilty of treason. The foregoing slice of Am erican history m ust be taken into account if one is to make sense of the vagaries of Am erican fo reign policy since the end of W orld W ar II, specifically the record, as presented in this book, of what the US m ilitary and the CI A and other branches of the US governm ent have done to the peoples of the world. In 1918, the barons of Am erican capital needed no reason for their war against communis m other than the threat to their wealth and privilege, although their opposition was expressed in term s of m oral indignation. During the period between the two worl d wars, US gunboa t diplom acy operated in the Carib bean to m ake \"The Am erican La ke\" safe for the fortunes of United Fruit and W.R. Grace & Co., at the sam e tim e taking care to warn of \" the Bolshevik threat\" to all that is decen t from the likes of Nicaraguan rebel Augusto Sandino. By the end of the Second W orld W ar, every Am erican past the age of 40 had been subjected to som e 25 ye ars of anti-comm unist radiation, the averag e incubation period needed to p roduce a malignan cy. Anti-comm unism had developed a life of its own, independent of its capitalist father. Increa sing ly, in th e pos t-wa r period, m iddle-aged 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Washington policy m akers and diplom ats saw the world ou t there as on e com posed of \"communists\" and \"anti-comm unists\", whethe r of nations, move ments or individuals. This com ic-strip vision of the world, wi th righteous A merican superm en fighting communist evil everyw here, had graduated fr om a cynical propaganda exercise to a moral im perative of US foreign policy. Even the concept of \"non-comm unis t\", im plying som e m eas ure of neutrality, has generally been accorded scant legitim acy in this paradigm . John Foster Dulles, one of the m ajor architects of post-war US forei gn policy, expressed this succinctly in his typically simple, moralistic wa y: \"For us there are two so rts of people in the world: there are those who are Christians and suppor t free enterprise and there are the others.\" 14 As several of the case studies in th e pres ent ho ok conf irm , Dulles pu t that creed into rigid practice. The word \"comm unist\" (as well as \"Marxis t\") has been so overused and so abused by Am erican leaders an d the m edia as to rende r it virtually m eaningl ess. (The Left has done the sam e to the word \"fascist\".) But merely having a nam e for something—witches or flying sau cers—attach es a certain credence to it. At the same tim e, the Am erican public , as we have seen, has been soundly conditioned to react Pavlovianly to the term : it means, still, the worst excesses of Stalin, from wholesale purges to Siberian slave-labor cam ps; it m eans, as Mic hael Paren ti has observed, that \"Classi c Marxis t-Len inist predictions [concerning world revolution] are treated as statem ents of inten t directing all present-day com munist actions .\" 15 It m eans \"us\" against \"them \". And \"them \" can m ean a peasan t in the Ph ilippin es, a m ural-painte r in N icar agua, a legally-e lected pr im e m inister in British Guiana, or a European intellec tual, a Ca mbodian neutralist, an African nationa list—all, som ehow, part of the same monolithic conspira cy; each, in som e way, a th reat to the Am erican W ay of Life; no land too sm all, too poor, or too far away to pose such a threat, the \"communist threat\". The cases presented in this book illus trate th at it has been largely irrelevant whether the particular targets of interventi on—be they individuals , po litica l par ties, move ments or governments—called them selves \"communist\" or not. It has m attered little whethe r they were scholar s of diale ctical m aterialism or had never heard of Karl Marx; whether they were atheists or priest s; whether a strong and influential Communist Party was in the picture or not; whether the governm ent ha d com e into being through violent revolution or peaceful elections ... all have been targets, all \"communists\". It has m atter ed still less that the Soviet KGB was in the pictu re. The assertion has been frequently voiced that the CIA carries o ut its dir ty tricks larg ely in reac tio n to operations of the KGB which have been \"even dirtier\". This is a lie m ade out of whole cloth. There m ay be an is olated incident of su ch i n the course of the CIA' s life, but it has kept itself well hidden. The relationship betwee n the two s inister agen cies is m arked by fratern izatio n and respect for fello w professio nals m ore th an by hand-to-hand combat. Form er CIA officer John Stockwell has written: Actu ally, at least in m ore ro utin e op erations , case offi cers m ost fear the US ambassador a nd his staff, then rest ric tive headqua rters cable s, then curious, gossip y neighbo rs in the lo cal co mm unity, a s potential th reats to operation s.

Last o f all is the KGB —in m y twelv e years of case officeri ng I never sa w o r he ard of a si tuation i n whi ch t he K GB attacked or obs tructed a CIA ope ration. 16 Stockwell a dds that the various inte lligenc e services do not w ant their world to be \"com plicated\" by m urde ring each other. 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"It isn't done . If a C IA case officer ha s a fl at tire i n the da rk of ni ght on a lonel y roa d, he will not hesitate to accept a ri de from a KGB officer—likely the two wo uld det our to some bar f or a dri nk toget her. In fact C IA a nd K GB officers ent ertain eac h ot her fre que ntly in their hom es. The CIA' s files are full of mention of suc h rel ations hips in almost ever y Af rican station. 17 Proponents of \"fighting fire with fire\" com e perilously close at tim es to arguing that if the KGB, for exam ple, had a ha nd in the overthrow of the Czechoslovak governm ent in 1968, it is OK for the CIA to have a hand in the overthrow of the Chilean governm ent in 1973. It' s as if the destruc tion of dem ocracy by the KGB deposits funds in a bank account from which the C IA is then justified in making withdrawals. What then has been th e thread co mmon to the diverse targets of Am erican intervention which has brought down upon the m the wrath, and often t he firepower, of the world' s most powerful nation? In virt ually every case involving the Third W orld described in this book, it ha s been, in one form or a nother, a policy of \"self- determ ination\": the desire, born of perceived need and principle, to pursue a path of developm ent independent of US foreign policy objectives. Most commonly, this has been m anifested in (a) the am bition to fr ee them selves from econom ic and political subservience to th e United States; (b ) the re fusal to m inim ize rela tions with the soc ialist bloc, or suppress the lef t at hom e, or welcom e an Am erican m ilitary installation on their soil; in shor t, a ref usal to be a paw n in the Co ld W ar; or (c) th e atte mpt to alter or replace a governm ent which held to neither of these aspirations; i.e., a government supported by the United States. It cannot be em phasized too strongly that such a policy of independence has been viewed and expressed by num erous Third W orld leaders and revolutionaries as one not to be equated by definition to anti-Am ericanism or pro-communis m, but as sim ply a determ ination to m aintain a position of neut rality and non- alignm ent vis-a-vis the two superpowers . Tim e and tim e again, however, it w ill b e seen that the United State s was not prepared to live with this proposition.

Accordingly , if Ronald Reagan were to con ced e that th e masses of El Salvador have every good reason to rise up against their god-awful exis tence, it would bring into question his accusation, and the rationale for US interven tion, that it is principally (only? ) the Soviet Union a nd its Cuban and Nicaraguan allies w ho instigate the Salvadoreans: that seem ingly m agical power of comm unists ever ywhere who, with a twist of their red wrist, ca n tran sform peaceful, happy people into furious guerrillas.

In pres enting the interventions in this m anner, I am declarin g that Am erican foreign polic y is what Am erican foreign policy does. Excerpts from the Introduction, 1995 edition In 1993, I cam e across a review of a book about people who deny that the Nazi Holocaust actually occu rred. I wrote to the auth or, a university professo r, telling her that her book made m e wonder whether she knew th at an American holocaust had taken place, and that the d enial of it put the denial of the Nazi o ne to sham e. So broad and deep is the d enial of the Am erican holocaus t, 1 said, that the denye rs are not even aware that the cla imers or their c laim exist. Yet, a few m illion people ha ve died in the Am erican h olocaus t and m any m ore m illions ha ve been con dem ned to lives of m isery and tor ture as a re sult of US interventi ons extending from China and Greece in the 1940s to Afghanistan and Iraq in the 1990s. I en closed a listing of these interventions , which is of course the s ubject of the present book. In m y letter I also offered to exchan ge a copy of the earlier edition of m y book for a copy of hers, but she wrote back infor ming me that sh e w as not in a p osition to do so. And that was all she said. Sh e m ade no comm ent whatsoever about the rem ainder of my letter— the part dealing with denying the Am erican holocaust—not even to acknowledge that I had raised the m atter. The irony of a scholar on the subject of denying the Nazi Holocaust engaging in such denial about the Am erican holocaust was classic indeed. I was puzzled why the good pr ofessor had bothered to respond at all. Clearly, if my thesis could receive such a non-response from such a person, I and my thesis faced an extrem ely steep uphill s trugg le. In the 193 0s, and again after the w ar in the 1940s and ' 50s, anti-comm unists of various stripes in the United States tried their best to expose the crim es of the Soviet Un ion, such as the purge trials and the m ass murders. But a strange thing happened. The truth did not seem to ma tter. Am erican Communists and fellow travelers continued to support the Krem lin. Even allowing for the exaggeration and disinform ation regular ly disbursed by the anti-communists which dam aged their credibility, the continued ignorance and/or denial by the Am erican lef tists is re markable. At the clos e of the Se cond W orld W ar, wh en the vic toriou s Allies dis covered the Germ an concentr ation c amps, in som e cases Germ an citize ns f rom nearby towns were brought to the cam p to com e face-to-face with the institu tio n, the pile s of corpses, and the still- liv ing skele tal people; some of the res pectab le burghers were even forced to bury the dead.

W hat if all the ni ce, clean-cut, wholes om e Am erican boys who dropped an infinite tonnage of bombs, on a dozen different count ries, on people they knew nothing about— characters in a video ga me—had to com e down t o earth and look upon and smell the burning flesh? 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"It has becom e convent ional wisdom that it was the re lentlessly tough anti- communist policies of the Reag an Adm inistration, with its h eated-up arm s race, that led to the co llap se and reform ation of the Soviet Union and its satellites.

When R onald Reagan vis ited East Berlin, the people there cheered him and thanked him \"for his role in liberating the East\". Even m any lef tist analys ts, par ticu larly those of a conspiracy bent, are believers. But this view is not universally held; nor should it be. Long the leading Soviet expert on the Unite d States, Georgi Arbatov, head of the Moscow-based Institute for th e Study of the U.S.A. and Canada, wrote his m emoirs i n 1992. A Los Angeles Times book review by Robert Scheer summ ed up a portion of it: Arb atov understoo d all coo well th e failin gs of Soviet to talitarian ism in compariso n to th e econ omy a nd politics o f the West.

Gorbach ev' s close adviser, Aleksandr Yakovlev, when asked whether th e Reagan adm inist ratio n's higher m ilitary spending, combined with its \"E vil Em pire\" rhetoric, f orced th e Soviet Union into a m ore concilia tory position, responded: It p layed no role.

However, on this question we don' t have to rely on the opinion of any individual, Russian or Am erican. We merely have to look at the historical facts. From the late 1940s to around the m id-1960s , it was an Am erican policy objective to instigate the downfall of the Sovi et govern ment as well as several Eastern European regim es. Many hundreds of Russian exiles were organized, trained and equipped by the CIA, then sneaked back into their h omeland to set up espio nage rings, to stir up armed political struggle, and to carry out acts of assassination and sabotage, such as derailing 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"trains, wrecking bridges, da maging arm s factories and power plants, and so on. The Soviet governm ent, which captured m any of these m en, was of course fully aware of who was behind all this. Com pared to this policy , that of the R eagan adm inistration could be categorized as one of virtual capitulation. Yet what we re the fruits of this ultra-tough anti- communist policy? Repeated serious confront ations between the United States and the Soviet Union in Berlin, Cuba and elsewhere, the Soviet interventions into Hungary and Czechoslovakia, creation of the W arsaw Pact (in direct reaction to NATO), no glasnost , no perestroika , only pervasive suspicion, cynicism and hostility on both sides. It turned out that the Russians were human afte r all—they responded to toughness with toughness. And the corollary: there was for ma ny years a close correlation between the am icability of US-Soviet relation s and the num ber of Jews allowed to emigra te f rom the Soviet Union. 28 Softness produced softness. If there' s anyone to attribut e the changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe to, both the beneficial ones and those questi onable, it is of course Mikhail Gorbachev and the ac tiv ists he inspir ed. It should be rem embered that Re agan was in office for over four years before Gorbachev cam e t o power, and Thatcher for six years, but in that period of tim e nothing of any significance in the way of Soviet reform took place despite Rea gan' s and Thatche r's unrem itting m alice toward th e communist sta te.

This argum ent breaks up on the rocks of a single ques tion, w hich was all one had to ask back then: W hy would the Soviets wa nt to invade Western Europe or bom b the United States ? They clearly had n othing to gain by such actions ex cept the almost certain destruction of their country, whic h they were painstakingly rebuilding once again after the devastation of the war. By the 1980s, the question that still dare d not be asked had given birth to a $300 billion m ilitary budget and Star W ars.

Both the Am ericans and the Germ ans believed their own propaganda, or pretended to. In reading Mein Kampf , one is struck by the fa ct that a significant part of what Hitler wrote about Jews reads v ery m uch like an Am erican anti-communist writing about communists: He starts with the prem ise that the Jews (co mmunists) ar e evil and want to dom inate the world; then, any behavi or which appears to contradict this is regarded as sim ply a ploy to fool people and further their ev il ends; this behavior is always part of a conspiracy and m any people ar e taken in. He ascr ibes to the Jews gr eat, alm ost m ystical, power to m anipulate socie ties and econom ies. He blames Jews for the ills aris ing from the industrial revo lution, e .g., class div ision s and hatred . He decries the Jews' internationalism and lack of national patriotism . There were of course those Cold Warrior s whos e take on th e Krem lin was tha t its master plan for world dom ination was nothi ng so gross as an invasion of W estern Europe or dropping bombs on the United Stat es.

It was just unfortuna te that Adolf turned out to be such a megalom aniac and turned W est as well. But that war was over. These Am ericans were now to have their day in every corner of the world. The ink on the Japanese surrender treaty was hardly dry when the United Sta tes began to use the Ja panese so ldiers still in China along side Am erican troops in a joint effort against the Chin ese comm unists.

G eneralissim o Chiang Kai-shek would be Washington' s m an. He headed what passed for a central governm ent in China. T he Office of Strategic Services (OSS, forerunner of the CIA) estim ated that the bulk of Chiang' s m ilitary effort had been directed ag ainst the c omm unists rathe r th an the Japanese. He had also done his best to block the cooperation between the Reds and the Am ericans. Now his army contained Japanese units and his regim e wa s full of officials who had collaborated with the Japanese and served in their puppet governm ent. 2 But no matter. The Generalissimo was as anti-comm unist as they com e. Moreover, he w as a born Am erican client. His forces would be properly trained and equipped to do battle with the m en of Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai. President Trum an was up front about what he described as \"using the Japanese to hold off the Communists\": It was perfectly clear to us that if we t old the Jap anese t o lay do wn their arm s im mediately and m arch t o the seab oar d, the ent ire c ount ry w oul d be t aken ove r by the C ommuni sts.

The official Un ited States explanation for the presence of its m ilitary was that they were there to dis arm and repatriate th e Japanese. Though this task was indeed carried out eventuall y, it was secondary to the m ilitary' s political function, as Trum an' s statem ent c ited above m akes abundantly cleat. The Am erican soldiers in China began to protest about not being sent hom e, a com plaint echoed round the world by other GI s kept overseas for pol itical (usually anti- communist) purposes. \"T hey ask m e, too, why they 're here,\" said a Marine lieutenant in China at Christm as-tim e, 1945. \"As an officer I am supposed to tell them, but you can't tell a m an that he' s here to disarm Japane se when he' s guar ding th e sa me railway with [ar med] Japanese.\" 10 Strangely enough, the United States attem pted to m ediate in the civil war; this, while being an active, powerful participant on one side. In January 1946, President Trum an, apparently recognizing that it was ei ther com promise with the communists or see all of China fall under their sway, sent Ge neral George Marshall to try and arrange a cease-fire and som e kind of unspecified co alitio n governm ent. W hile som e te mporary success was achieved in an on — a nd — off truce, the idea of a coalition governm ent was doom ed to failure, as unlikely as a m arriage between the Czar and th e Bolshevik s. As the historian D.F.

At about this sam e tim e, the Flying Tigers began to operate. The legendary Am erican air squadron under the l eadership of General Claire Chennault had fought for the Chinese against the Japanese before and during the world war.

It had not been only the onslaught of Chiang' s communist foes, but the hostility of the Chinese peopl e at large to his ty ranny, his wanton cruelty, and the ex traordinary corruption an d decadence of his entire bureaucratic and socia l system . By contrast, the large areas under com munist administration were m odels of honesty, progress and fairness; enti re divisions of the Generali ssim o's forces defected to the communists. Am erican political and military leaders had no illusions about the nature and quality of Chiang' s rule. The Na tion alist f orces, said Gener al David Ba rr, head of the US Military Missi on in China, were under \"th e world' s worst lead ersh ip\". 14 The Generalissim o, his cohorts and soldiers fled to the offshore island of Taiwan (Form osa). They had prepared their entry tw o years ea rlier by terro riz ing the island ers into subm ission—a m assacre which took the lives of as m any as 28,000 people. 15 Prior to the Nationalists' escape to the island, the US governm ent entertained no doubts that Taiwan was a part of China. Afterward, uncer tainty beg an to cr eep in to the m inds of Washington officials. T he crisis was reso lved in a rem arkably sim ple m anner: the US agreed with Chiang that the prope r way to view the situation was not that Taiwa n belonged to China, but that Taiwan was China. And so it was called. In the wake of the co mmunist success, China scholar F elix Greene observed, \"Am ericans sim ply could not bring them selves to believe that the Chinese, however rotten their leadership, could have preferred a comm unist governm ent.\" 16 It m ust have been the handiwork of a conspi racy, an international conspir acy, at the control panel of which sat, not unexpectedly, the Soviet Uni on. The evidence for this, however, was thin to th e poin t of tran sparency. Ind eed, ever since Stalin' s credo of \"socialism in one country\" won out over Trotsky' s internationa lism in the 1920s, the Russians had sided with Chiang m ore than with Mao, advising the latter m ore than once to dissolve his arm y and join Chiang' s governm ent. 17 Particu larly in the pos t-W orld W ar II y ears, when the Soviet Union was faced with its own stag gering crisis of rec onstru ction, d id it not relish the prospect of having to help li ft the world' s most populous nation into the modern age. In 1947, General Marshall stated pu blicly that he knew of no evidence that the Chinese communists were being supported by the USSR. 18 But in the United States this did not prevent the rise of an entire m ythology of how the US had \"los t\" C hina: Sov iet inte rvention, State Departm ent communists, W hite House cowards, m ilitary and diplom atic folly, co mmunist dupes and fellow-travelers in the m edia ... treachery everywhere ... The Trum an adm inistration, said Senato r Joseph McCarthy with characteristic charm , was com posed of \"egg-sucking phony liberals\" who protected the \"Comm unists and queers\" who had \"sold Chin a in to atheistic slavery\". 19 Yet, short of an all-out invasion of th e country by large numbers of Am erican troops, it is difficult to see wh at m ore the US governm ent could have done to prevent Chiang' s downfall. Even after Chiang fled to Taiwan, th e Unite d States pursued a cam paign of relentless assa ults against the communist governm ent, despite a request from Chou En-lai for aid and friendship. The Red leader saw no practical or ideo log ical bar to this. 20 Instead, the United States evidently conspired to assassinate Chou on several occasions. 21 22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Many Nationalist soldiers had taken refuge in northern Burm a in the great exodus of 1949, much to the displeasure of the Bur mese Governm ent.

In one in stance, in April 1951, a few thousand troops, accompanied by CIA advisers and supplied by air dro ps from American C46s and C47s, crossed the border into China' s Yunnan province, but they were driven back by the communists in les s than a week.

On th e Chinese b order tw o greater battles were raging: in Korea and Vietnam . It was the hope of the United States to force the Chinese to divert troops and military res ources away from these areas. The infant People' s Republic of China was undergoing a terrible test. In between raids on China, the \"Chinats\" (as distingui shed from the \"Chicom s\") found tim e to clash frequently with Bur mese troops, indulge in banditry, and becom e the opium barons of T he Golden Triangle, that slice of land encom passing parts of Bur ma, Laos and Thailand which was the world' s largest source of opium and heroin. CIA pilots flew the stuff all over, to secu re the cooperation of those in Thailand w ho were im portant to the military operation, as a favor to their Nationalist clients, perhaps even for the money, and, ironically, to serve as cover for their m ore illicit activ ities. The Chinats in Bur ma kept up their harassm ent of the Chicom s until 1961 and the CIA continu ed to supply them m ilitarily, bu t at s ome point the Agency began to ph ase itself out of a m ore direct involvem ent. W hen the CIA, in response to repeated protests by the Bur mese Governm ent to th e United St ates and th e United Na tions, put pressure on the Chinats to leave Bur ma, Chiang respond ed by threatening to expose the Agency's covert support of his troops there. A t an earlier s tage, th e CIA had entertained the hope that the Chinese would be provoked into atta cking Burm a, t hereby forcing the strictly neutral Burm ese to seek salvation in the W estern cam p. 22 In January 1961, the Chinese did jus t tha t, but as p art of a combined f orce with the B urm ese to overwhelm the Nationalists' m ain base and m ark finis to their Burm ese adventure.

In Nove mber 1952, two CI A officers, John Downey and Richard Fectea u, who had been engaged in flying these team s in a nd dropping supplies to them , were shot down and c aptured by the communists. Two years passed before Peki ng announced the capture and sentencing of the two m en. The State Departm ent broke its own two-year silence with indignation, claim ing that the two men had been civilian employees of the US Departm ent of the Ar my in Japan who were presum ed lost on a flight from Korea to Japan. \"How they cam e into the hands of the Chinese Communi sts is unknown to the United States ... the continued wrongful detention of these Am eri can citizens furnishes further proof of the Chinese Comm unist regim e's disregard for accepted practices o f internatio nal conduct.\" 26 Fecteau was released in Decem ber 1971, s hortly before President Nixon' s trip to China; Downey was not freed until March 1973, soon after Nixon publicly acknowledged him to be a CIA offic er.

The fact that the C omm unists had been the single m ost active anti-fascist group in Italy during the war, undergoing ruthless persecution, while the Christian Dem ocrat governm ent of 1948 and other el ectoral opponents on the right were riddled through with collaborators, m onarchist s and plain unreconstructed fa scists ... this too would be ignored; indeed, turned around. It w as now a matter of Communist \"dictatorship\" vs. their adversaries' love of \"freedom\"; this was presum ed a prio ri. As one exam ple, a group of Am erican congressm en visite d Italy in summe r 1947 and casually and arbitrarily concluded that \"The country is und er great pressure from within and without to veer to th e lef t and ad opt a to tal itarian- collective nation al organiz ation .\" 2 To m ake any of this at all c redib le, the whole picture had to be pushed and squeezed in to the fram e of The American W ay of Life vs. The Soviet Way of Life, a specious p roposition w hich m ust have com e as som ewhat of a shock to leftis ts who regarded them selves as Italian and neither Russian nor Am erican. In February 1948, after non-Communist m inisters in Czechoslov akia had boycotted cabinet m eetings over a dispute concerning police hi ring practices, the Communist governm ent dissolved th e coalition cabinet and took sole po wer. The Voice of America pointed to th is event rep eatedly, as a warning to the Italian people of the fate 27"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"awaiting th em if Italy \" went Communist\" (and used as well by anti-communists for decades afterward as a prim e exa mple of co mmunist duplicity). Yet, by all appearances, the Italian Christian Democrat governm ent and the Am erican governm ent had conspired the prev ious year in an even more blatant usurpation of power. In January 1947, when Italian Prem ier Al cide de Gasperi visited W ashington at the United States' invitation, his overriding co ncern was to plead for crucial financial assistance for his war-torn, im poverished c ountry. Am erican officials m ay have had a different priority. Three days after re turning to Italy, de Gasp eri un expec tedly dissolv ed his cabinet, which included se veral Communists and Socialists. The press repo rted that many people in Italy believed that de Gasper i's action wa s re lated to his visit to the United States and was aim ed at decreasing le ftist, pr incip ally Co mm uni st, influence in the governm ent. After two weeks of tortuous de lay, the form ation of a center or center- right governm ent sought by de Gasperi proved in feasible; the new cabinet still included Communists and Socialists a lthough the left had lost key positions, notably the ministries of foreign affairs and finance. From this point until May, when de Gasperi' s deputy, Ivan Lom bardo, led a mission to Washington to renew the request for aid, prom ised loans were \"frozen\" by the United S tates for reasons not very clear. On several occasions during this period the Ita lian lef t asser ted the ir be lief th at the aid was being held up pending the ouster of lef tists f rom the cabinet. The New Y ork Times was m oved to note that, \"Som e observers here feel tha t a furthe r L eftward swing in It aly would retard aid.\" As m atters tu rned out, the day Lombardo arrived in W ashington, de Gasperi again dissolved his entire cabinet and suggested that the new cabinet would manage without the benefit of lef tist members. This was indeed what occurred, and over the ensu ing few months, exceeding ly generous Am erican financial ai d flowed into Italy, in addition to the cancellation of the nation 's $1 billi on debt to the United Sta tes. 3 At the very sam e ti me, France, wh ich was also heavily dependent upon Am erican financial aid, ousted all its Communist m inisters as well. In this case the re was an immediate rationale: th e refusal of the Comm unist ministers to support Prem ier Ram adier in a vote of confidence over a wage freeze. Despite th is, the ouster was regard ed as a \"surp rise\" and considered \"b old\" in France, and opinion w as widespread that Am erican loans were being used, or woul d be used, to force France to align w ith the US. Said Ram adier: \"A little of our in dependence is d eparting fro m us with each loan we obtain.\" 4 As the last m onth of th e 1948 election cam paign began, Time m agazine pronounced the possible leftist victory to be \"the brink of catastrophe\". 5 \"It was prim arily this fear,\" W illiam Co lby, form er Director of the CIA, has written, \"that had led to the form ation of th e Offi ce of Policy Coordination, which gave the CIA th e capab ility to undertake covert p olitical, pro paganda, an d param ilitary operations in the first place. \" 6 But covert operations, as far as is known, played a rela tive ly minor role in the Am erica n cam paign to break the back of the Italian lef t.

But they also provided another dram atic ex ample of the liberating effects of a w orld war: the en crusted ways of the Greek old guard were cas t aside; in th eir p lace arose communitie s which ha d at leas t the sem blance of being run by the loca l re sid ents, inchoate in stitu tion s a nd m echanism s which m ight have been the precurso r of a regenerated Greek society after the war; e ducation, perhaps geared toward propaganda, but for the illiterate education nonetheless; fighting battalions of wome n, housewives called upon for the first tim e to act indepe ndently of their husbands' control ... a phenom enon which spread irrepressibly unt il EAM cam e to num ber som e one to two million Greeks out of a population of seven m illio n. 2 This was hardly the kind of social or der des igned to calm the ulcers of the British old guard (W inston Church ill for one ) who had lo ng rega rded Greece as their private m anor. The Great Man was determ ined that the Greek king s hould be restored to his rightful place, with all tha t th at im plie d, and the British m ilita ry in Greece lost no tim e in installing a governm ent dedicated to that end. Monarchists, quislings, and conservatives of all stripes found them selves in positions of political pow er, predom inant in the new Greek army and police; m embers of EAM/ELAS found them selves dead or in prison. 3 In the ea rly days of the world war, when def eating the Na zis was the Allies' over whelming purpose, Churchill h ad ref erred to ELAS as \"those ga llant guer rilla s\", and ELAS' s supporters had welcomed the Brit ish in early Novem ber 1944 with a sign reading, \"We Greet the Brav e English Arm y. ...

(The British Fo reign Secretary, E rnest Bevin, acknowledged in August 1946 that there were 228 ex-m embers of the Nazi Securi ty Battalions—whose main task had been to track down Greek resistance fighters and Jews—on active service in the new Greek arm y.) 5 Further support for the ca mpaign against ELAS ca me from the US Air Force and Navy which transported more than two British divisions into Greece.'

Th ere is disagreement am ongst historians as to whether ELAS had been m ilita rily def eated or whether the Communists in the EL AS and EAM hierarchy had received the word from Stalin to lay down the gun. If the latter were the case, it would have been consistent w ith th e noted agreem ent between Stalin and Churchill in October 1944, whereby sphere s of influence in Eastern Europe w ere allocated between the two powe rs. In th is cynical (as Chur chill acknowledged) Monopoly g ame Britain had landed on Greece.

The Communists had wrenched Stalin' s strangulating hand from their throats, for their v ery su rviva l was at stake and everyt hing that they believed in.

Washington officials well knew that their ne w client governm ent was so venal and so abusive of hum an ri ghts that even confirm ed Am erican anti- communists were appalled. Stewart Alsop for one. On 23 February 1947 the noted journalist had cabled from Athens that m ost of the Greek politicians had \"no higher am bition tha n to tas te th e prof itab le deligh ts of a free econo my at Am erican expense\". 15 The sam e year, an Am erican investigating team found huge supplies of food aid rotting in warehouses at a tim e when an estim ated 75 percent of Greek children were suffering from m alnutrition. 16 So difficult was it to gloss over this pictu re, that Pres ident Trum an, in his address to Congress in March 194 7 aski ng for aid to Greece based on the Greek \"reques t\" (th e \"Trum an Doctrine \" sp eech), attempted to pre -empt critic ism by adm itting that the Greek government was \"not perfect\" and that \"it has m ade m istakes\". Yet, som ehow, by som e ideological alchem y best known to the president, the regim e in Athens was \"dem ocratic\", its oppon ents the fam iliar \"terrorists\". 17 There was no m ention of the Soviet Uni on in this particular speech, bu t tha t was to be th e relen tless ref rain of th e Am eri can rationale over the next 2 1/2 years: the Russians were instigating the Gr eek leftists so as to kidna p yet another \"free\" country and drag it kicking and scr eam ing behind the Iron Curtain. The neighboring Communist states of Bulgaria, Albania, and particularly Yugoslavia, in part m otivated by old territ orial claim s against Greece, did aid the insurgents by allowing them import ant sa nctuary behind their borders and furnishing them with m ilitary sup plies (whether subs tantial or m erely token in am ount is a debatable question). The USSR, however, in the person of Joseph St alin, was adam antly opposed to assisting the Greek \"com rades\".

(Signi ficant quantities had also been shipped to the Greek governm ent by the US while the British ran the show.] By t he end of the year, th e Gr eek m ilitary was being entirely sup ported by A merican aid, down to and including its clothing and food.

The Mission, re lated Br itish m ilitary writer Major Edgar O'Ballance, \"took a tough line and insisted tha t all its re comm endations be carried into effect, at o nce and in full\". 20 Eventually, m ore than 250 Am erican ar my officers were in the country, m any assigne d to Greek arm y divisions to ensure com pliance with directives; others operated at the brigade level; another 200 or so US Air Force an d Navy personnel were also on active duty in Greece.

W oodhous e, the Brit ish colonel and historian who served in Greece du ring the m id-1940s, \"an d the th eoretical line between ad vice, inte llig ence and com bat was a narro w one.\" 22 The Greek lef tists held out f or th ree ter rible ye ars. Despite losses of m any tens of thousands, they were always able to replenish their forces , even increase their num ber. But by October 1949, foreseeing nothing but m ore loss of lives to a vastly superio r des truction-m achine, the gu errillas anno unced over their radio a \"cease fire\". It was the end of the civil war. The extent of Am erican hegem ony over Greece from 1947 onwards can scarcely be exaggerated. W e have seen Ma rshall' s dire ctives to Griswold, and the Am erican managem ent of the m ilitary cam paign. There were m any other m anifestations of the sam e phenom enon, of which the following are a sam ple: In Septem ber 1947, Vice-Prim e Minister C onstantine Tsaldaris agreed to the dissolution of the governm ent and the creati on of a new ruling coalition. In doing so, said the New York Ti mes, Tsaldaris had \"surrendered to the de sires of Dwight P. Griswold ... of [US] Ambassador MacVeagh, and also of the King\". 23 Before Tsal dari s addressed th e Greek leg islatu re on th e m atter, MacVeagh stepped in to m ake a change to the sp eech. 24 Over the next several y ears, each o f the frequent changes of prim e m inister cam e about only after considerable Am erican input, if not outright dem and. 25 One exam ple of the latter occurred in 1950 when then Am erican Am bassador Henry Grady 36"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"sent a letter to Prim e Minis ter Venizelo s th reatening to c ut of f US aid if he f ailed to carry out a governm ent reorganization. Ve nizelos was compelled to step down. 26 The Am erican in fluence was felt in rega rd to ot her high positions in Greek society as w ell. Andreas Papandreou, later to become prim e m inister him self, has written of this period that \"Cab inet m embers and arm y-generals, political party leaders and m embers of the Establishm ent, all m ade open references to Am erican wishes or views in order to jus tify or to account for their own actions or posi-tions.\" 27 Before undertaking a new crackdown on dissidents in July 1947, Gree k authorities first approached Am bassador Macveagh. The ambassador infor med them that the US governm ent would have no objectio n to \"preventive m easures if they were considered necessary\". Reassured, the Gr eeks w ent ahead and rounded up 4,000 people in one week. 28 An exam ple of what co uld land a Greek c itize n in p rison is the c ase of the EAM m ember who received an 18-m onth se ntence for printing rem arks deem ed insulting to Dwight Griswold. He had referr ed to the Am erican as \"th e official representative of a foreign country\". 29 \"In the econom ic sphere,\" Andreas Papandreou noted, the United States \"exercised alm ost dictatorial control during the early f ifties requir ing th at the signa ture of the chief of the U.S. Econom ic Mission ap pear alongside that of the Greek Minister of Co-ordination on any im portant docum ents.\" 30 Earlier, American m anagem ent of the econom y m ay have been even tighter. A memorandum from Athens dated 17 Nove mber 1947, from the Am erican Mission to Aid Greece to the State Departm ent in W ashi ngton, read in part: \"we have estab lish ed practical control ... over national budget, taxation, currency issuance, price and wage policies, and state econom ic planning, as we ll as over im ports and exports, the issuance of f oreign exchange and the direc tion of m ilita ry recons truction and relief expenditures.\" 31 There was, moreover, the creation of a new internal security agency, nam ed and m odeled after the CIA (KYP i n Greek). Before long, KYP was carrying out all the endearing practices of secret po lice ev erywhere, including system atic torture. By the early 1950s, Greece had been m olded into a suprem ely reliable ally - client of the United States. It was staunchly anti- communist and well integrated into the NATO system. It sent troops to Korea to s upport the United States' pretence that it w as not sim ply an Am erican war. It is safe to say that had the left co me to power, Greece would have been much more independent of the United States. Gr eece would likely have been independent as well of the Soviet Union, to whom the Greek left owed nothing. Like Yugoslavia, which is also free of a common border with th e U SSR, Greece would have been frie ndly towards the Russians, but independent. When, in 1964, there cam e to power in Greece a governm ent which entertained the novel id ea th at Greece wa s a sovereign nation, the U nited States and its Greek cohorts, as we shall see, quickly an d effectively stam ped out the heresy. 37"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"4.

Af ter the Sp anish had be en driven out of the Philippi nes in 1898 by a com bined action of th e United States and the Filip inos, Spain ag reed to \"c ede\" (that is, se ll) the islands to the United States for $20 m illio n. But the Filip inos, who had already proclaim ed their own independent republic, di d not take kindly to being treated like a plot of uninhabited real estate. Accordi ngly, an Am erican force num bering at least 50,000 proceeded to instill in th e pop ulation a pro per appr eciation of their status. Thus did Am erica' s longest-lasting and most conspicuous colony ever come into being. Nearly ha lf a centu ry la ter, the US Arm y again landed in the Philipp ines to f ind a nationalist m ove ment fighting against a co mmon enem y, t his tim e the Japanese. W hile com batting the Japanese during 1945, the Am erican m ilitary took m any measures aimed at quashing this resistance arm y, the Huks (a shortening of Hukbalahap-\"People' s Ar my Against Japan\" in Tagalog). Am erican fo rces disarm ed m any Huk units, rem oved the local governm ents whic h the Huks had esta blished, and arrested and imprisoned m any of their high-ranking mem bers as well as l ead ers of the Philipp ine Communist Party .

Others in W ashington and Manila, whose reflexes were less knee-jerk, but m ote cyn ical, recogn ized that the Huk move ment, if its growing influence was not checked, would lead to sweeping reform s of Philipp ine s ociety. The centerp iece of the Huk political program was land reform, a crying need in this largely agricu ltu ral society. (On occasi on, US officials would pay lip-serv ice to the concept, but during SO years of Am erican occupation, nothing of the sort had been carried out.) The other side of the Huk coin was industrialization, which the United States had long thwarted in order to provi de Am erican industries with a veritable playground in the Philippines. From the Huks ' point of view, such changes were but prologue to raising the islanders from th eir state of backwardness, from illiteracy, grinding poverty, and the diseases of povert y like tuberculosis a nd beri-beri. \"The Communist Hukbalahap rebellion, \" repo rted the New York Tim es, \"is generally regarded as an outgrowth of the m isery and discontent am ong the peasants of Central Luzon [the m ain island].\" 4 A study prepared years later for the US Ar my ec hoed this sentim ent, stating that the Huks' \"m ain i mpetus was peasant grievances, not Leninist designs\". 5 Nevertheless, the Huk move ment was unm istakably a thr eat to the ne o-colon ial condition of the Philippines, the Am erican s phere of influence, and those Philippine inte rests which benef ited from the status quo . By the end of 1945, four m onths after the close of W orld War II, the United States was train ing and equipping a force of 50,000 Filipino soldiers for the Cold War. 6 In testim ony before a congression al comm ittee, Major General W illiam Arnold of the US Ar my candidly stated that this progr am was \"essen tial f or the m aintenance of inte rnal ord er, not f or extern al dif ficulties a t all\". 7 None of the congressm en present publicly expressed any reservation about the international propriety of such a foreign policy. At the sam e tim e, Am erican sold ier s were kept on in the Philipp ines, an d in at least one infantry division com bat training was re-established. This led to vociferous protests and de monstrations by the GIs w ho wa nted only to go hom e. The inauguration of com bat training, the New York Tim es di sclosed, was \"interpreted by soldiers and certain Filip ino newspap ers as the pr epara tion for the repression of possible uprisings in the Philippines by disgruntled farm tenant gr oups.\" The story added th at the sold ier s had a lot to sa y \"on the subjec t of Am erican a rmed intervention in China and the Netherlands Indies [Indo nesia],\" which was occurring at the sam e time. 8 To what e xtent Am erican m ilitary personnel participated directly in the suppress ion of dissident groups in th e Philipp ines after th e war is no t kno wn. The Huks, though no t tru sting Philipp ine and US authorities en ough to voluntarily surrender their arm s, did test the good faith of the governm ent by taking part in the April 1946 national elections as part of a \"Dem ocratic Alliance\" of liberal and socialis t peasant po litical groups. (Philipp ine independence was scheduled for three months later—the Fourth of July to be ex act.) As m atters turned out, the commander-in- chief of the Huks, Luis Taruc, and s evera l othe r Alliance m embers and ref orm -m inded candidates who won el ection to Congress (three to the Senate and seven to the House] 39"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"were not allowed to take their seats under th e transparent fiction th at coercion had been used to influence voters. No investigation or review of the cases had even been carried out by the appropriate body, the Electoral Tribunal. 9 (Two years late r, Taru c wa s tem porarily allowed to take his seat when he cam e to Manila to di scuss a ceasefire with the governm ent.) The purpose of denying these candidates th eir seats was eq ually tran sparent: the governm ent was thus able to push through Congress the controversial Philippine-US Trade Act—passed by two votes more than required in the House, and by nothing to spare in the Senate—which yielded to th e United States bountif ul privileges and concessions in the Philippine economy, including \"equal rights ... in the developm ent of the nation' s natural resources and th e operation of its public utilities\". 10 This \"par ity \" provision w as eventually extended to ever y sector of the Philippine econom y. 11 The debasem ent of the electoral process was followed by a wave of heavy bruta lity aga inst the peas ants ca rried out by the m ilitary, th e police, and landlo rd go on squads. According to Luis Taruc, in the m onths following the election, peasant villages were destroyed, m ore than 500 peasants and their leaders killed, and about three time s that num ber jailed, tortured, m aimed or m issing. The Huks and others felt they had little alternative b ut to take up arm s once again. 12 Independence was not likely to change m uch of significan ce. Am erican h istorian George E.T aylor, of impeccable establishm ent creden tials, in a book which bears the indication of CIA spons orship, was yet m oved to state that independence \"was m arked by lavish expression s of mutual good will, by partly fulfilled pro mises, and by a restoration of the old relationship in al most everything except in nam e. ...

A 1947 agr eem ent provided sites for 23 US m ilitary bases in the country. The agreem ent was to last for 99 y ears. It stip ulated that Am erican s ervicem en who comm itted crim es outside the base s while on duty cou ld be tr ied only by Am erican military trib unals ins ide the bases. By the terms of a com panion m ilita ry assis tanc e pact, the Ph ilipp ine gov ernm ent was prohibited from pur chasing so much as a bullet from any arm s source other than the US, except with Am erican app roval. Such a state of affairs, neces sarily invo lving training, m aintenance an d spare parts , m ade the Philipp ine m ilitary extrem ely dependent upon their Am erican counterparts. Further, no foreigners other than Am ericans were perm itted to perform any function for or with the Philipp ine arm ed for ces without the approval of the United States. 14 By early 1950, the United States had provided the Philippines with over $200 million of m ilitary equ ipm ent and supplies, a rem arkable sum for that tim e, and was in addition to the constr uction of v arious m ilitary f acilitie s. 15 The Joint US Military Advisory Group (JUS-MAG) reorganized th e Philipp ine intellig ence capability and defense departm ent, put its chosen m an, Ra mon Magsaysay, at its head, and for med the Philipp ine a rmy into batta lion com bat te am s trained f or co unter- insurg ency warf are. 16 The Philipp ines was to be a laboratory expe rim ent for this unconven tional type of com bat. The m ethods and the term inology, such as \"search-and-destroy\" and \"pacif icatio n\", were la ter to b ecom e infam ous in Vietnam . By Septem ber, when Lt. Col. Edward G. Lansdale arr ived in the Philipp ines, the civil war had all the m arkings of a long, draw n-out affair, with victory not in sight for eithe r side. Ostensibly, Lansdale wa s just a noth er Am erican m ilitary adv iser attached to JUSMAG, but in actuality he was the head of CIA cla ndestine and param ilitary 40"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"operations in the country. His apparent success in the Philippines was to m ake hi m a recognized authority in counter-insurgency. In his later rem iniscences about this pe riod in his life, Lansdale relates his surprise at hearing fro m infor med Filipino civilian friend s about ho w repress ive the Quirino gov ernm ent was, that its atro cities m atched those of (or attributed to) the Huks, that the gov ernm ent was \"rotten with corrup tio n\" (down to the polic em an in the str eet, Lansdale observed on his own), that Quirino him self had been elected the previous year through \"extensive fraud\", and that \"the Huks w ere right\", they we re the \"wave of the future\", and violence was the only way for th e people to get a governm ent of their own. (The police, wrote a correspondent for the Saturday Evening Post, were \"bands of uniform ed t hieves and rapists, m ore feared than bandits ... th e ar my was little better.\") 17 Lansdale was undeterred. He had com e to do a j ob. Accordingly, he told hi mself that if the Huks took over th ere would only be another f orm of injustice by another privileged few, backed by even crueller for ce. By the next chapter, he had convinced him self that he was work ing on the s ide of those comm itted to \"def end h uman libe rty in the Philippines\". 18 As a for mer advertising m an, Lansdale was no stranger to the use of m arket research, motivation techniques, m edia, and deception. In CIA parlance, such arts fall under the heading of \"psychological warfare\" . To this end, Lansdale fashioned a unit called the Civil Affairs Office. Its activiti es were based on the prem ise—one both new and suspect to m ost American m ilitary officers —that a pop ular guerrilla arm y cannot be defeated by force alone. Lansdale' s team conducted a careful study of the superstitions of the Filip ino peasants living in Huk areas: their lore, ta boos, and m yths were exam ined for clues to the appropriate appeals that could wean th em from supporting the insurgents. In one operation, Lansdale' s men flew over these areas in a sm all plane hidden by a cloud cover and broadcast in Tagalog m ysterious cu rses on any villagers who dared to give the Huks food or shelter. The tac tic reportedly succeeded into starving som e Huk units into surrende r. 19 Another Lansdale-initiated \"psywar\" opera tion played on the s uperstitious dread in the Philippine countryside of the asuang , a m ythical v ampire. A psywar squ ad entered a to wn and plan ted rum ors that an asuang lived in the neighboring hill where the Huks were based, a location from which governm ent forces were anxious to have them out. Two nights later, after giving the rum ors tim e to circulate am ong Huk sym pathizers in the to wn and m ake their wa y up the hill, the psyw ar squad laid an am bush for the rebels along a trail used by them . W hen a Huk pat rol passed, the am bushers silently snatched the last m an, punctured his neck va mpire-fashion with two holes, held his body by the heels until the blood drained out, and put the corpse back on the tra il. W hen the Huks, as superstitious as any other Filip ino s, discovere d the bloodless com rade, they fled from the region. 20 Lansdale re gular ly held \"cof fee klatsches \" with Filipino of ficials and m ilitary personnel in which new ideas were freely tosse d back and forth, a la a Madison Avenue brain session. Out of this cam e the Econom ic Developm ent Corps to lure Huks with a program of resettlem ent on their own patch of farm land, with tools, seeds, cash loans, etc. It was an undertaking wholly inadequate to the land problem , and t he num ber that responded was very modest, but like other ps ywar techniques, a principal goal was to steal from the enem y hi s m ost persuasive argum ents. 21 Among other tact ics introduced or refined by Lansdale were: production of film s and radio broadcasts to explain and justify governm ent actions; inf iltration of gover nment agents into the ranks of the Huks to provide inform ation and sow dissension; attem pts to m odify the behavior of 41"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"governm ent soldiers so as to curtail their a buse of people in rural areas (for the H uks had long followed an explicit code of pr oper conduct towards the peasants, with punishm ent m eted out to violators), but on oth er occasions, governm ent sold iers were allowed to run am ok in villages—disguised as H uks. 22 This last, revealed L.

The high- point of this effort was the election to the presidency, in 1953, of Ramon Mags aysay, the cooperative for mer defense departm ent head. Lansdale, it was said, \"invented\" Magsaysay. 25 His CIA front organizations— such as the National Mo vem ent f or Free Elect ions—ran the Filip ino' s ca mpaign with all the license, i mpunity, and m oney that one would expect from the De mocratic or Republican National Committees operating in the US, or perhaps m ore to the point, Mayor Dale y opera ting in Chic ago . Yet the New York Tim es, in an edito ria l, was moved to refer to the Philippines as \"dem ocracy' s showcase in Asia.\" 26 The CIA, on one occasion, drug ged the drinks of Magsaysay' s opponent, incum bent president Elpido Quirino, before he gave a speech so that he would appear incoherent. On another occasion, when Ma gsaysay insisted on deliv ering a speech which had been written by a Filipino inst ead of one written by Lansdale' s team, Lansdale reacted in a rage, fi nally hitting the presidential candidate so hard that he knocked him out. 27 Magsaysay won the election, but not befo re the CIA had smuggled in guns for use in a cou p in case their m an lost. 28 Once Magsaysay was in office, the C IA wrote h is speeches, carefully gu ided his foreign policy, and used its pr ess \"assets \" (paid editors an d journalists) to provide hi m with a constant claque of support for his dom estic program s and his involvem ent in the US-directed anti-communist crus ade in southe ast Asia, as well as to attack anti-US newspaper colum nists. So beholden was Ma gsaysay to the United States, disclosed presidential assistant Sherm an Ada ms, that he \"sent word to Eisenhower that he would do anything the United States wanted him to do—even though his own foreign m inister took the opposite view\". 29 42"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"One inventive practice of the CIA on beha lf of Magsaysay was later picked up by Agency stations in a num ber of other Thir d World countries.

Everything we' ve com e to love a nd cherish about Vietnam ha d its forerunner in Korea: the support of a co rrupt tyranny, the atrocities, th e napalm , the m ass slaughter of civilians, the cities an d villages laid to waste, the calculate d m anagem ent of the news, the sabo tag ing of peace talks. But th e Am eri can people were convinced that the war i n Korea was an unam biguous case of one c ountry invading another without provocation. A case of the bad guys attacking the good guys who were being saved by the even better guys; none of the historical, political and m oral uncertainty that was the dilemm a of Vietnam . The Korean War was seen to have begun in a specific m anner: North K orea attacked South Korea in the early morni ng of 25 June 1950; wh ile Vietnam ... no one seem ed to know how it all began, or when, or why. And there was little in the way of a ccusations about Am erican \"im perialism \" in Korea. The United States, after all, was figh ting as part of a United Nations Ar my. What was there to protest about? And of course there was McCarthyism , so prevalent in the early 1950s, which further serv ed to inhibit protest. There were, in f act, rather dif ferent inte rpre tatio ns to be m ade of what the war was all about, how it was being conducte d, even how it began, but these quickly succum bed to the heat of war fever. Shortly after the close of the Second World War, the Soviet Union and the United States occupied Korea in order to expel the defeated Japanese. A de marcation line between the Russian and Am erican forces was set up along the 38th Parallel. The creation of this line in no way had the expl icit o r im plicit in tention of establishing two separate countries, but the co ld war was soon to intrude. Both power s ins isted th at unification of North and S outh w as the principal and desired goal. However, they al so des ired to se e this ca rried o ut in their o wn ideological im age, and settled thereby in to a routine of proposal an d counter-proposal, accusation and counter-accusation, generously interm ixed with dev iousn ess, and p roduced noth ing in the way of an agreem ent during the ensuing years. Although both Moscow and Washington and their hand-picked Korean leaders were no t always disp leased abou t the division of the country (on the grounds that half a countr y was better than none), officials an d citiz ens o f both sides continued to genuinely call f or unif ication on a regular basis. That Korea was still one country, with uni fication still the goal, at the tim e the war began, was underscored by the chief US de legate to the UN, Warren Austin, in a statem ent he m ade shortly afterwards: The a rtificial bar rier which has divided North a nd South K orea has no basi s for existen ce eith er in law or in reason .

The North Korean Governm ent has claim ed that in 1949 alone, the South Korean army or poli ce perpetrated 2,617 arm ed incursions into the North to carry out m urder, kidnapping, pilla ge and arson for the purpose of causing social disorder and unrest, as well as to increas e the com bat capabilities o f the invaders. At tim es, stated the Pyongyang governm ent, thousands of soldiers were involved in a single b attle with m any casualties res ulting. 2 A State Departm ent offi cial, Am bassado r-at-larg e Philip C.

When you go to th is bou nd ary, as I did ... you see t roop m ove ments, f ortifications, an d pri soners of war . 3 Seen in this context, th e question of who fired the first shot on 25 June 1950 takes on a much reduced air of signif icance. As it is, the North Korean version of events is that their invasion was provoked by two da ys of bom bardm ent by the South Koreans, on the 23rd and 24th, followed by a surprise S outh Korean attack acro ss the border o n the 25th ag ainst the w estern town of H aeju and other p laces. Anno uncem ent of the Southern attack was broadcast over the Nort h's radio later in the m orning of the 25th. Contrary to general belief at the tim e, no United Nations group—neither the UN Milita ry Observer Grou p in the f ield nor the UN Commiss ion on Korea in Seoul— witnessed, or claim ed to have witnessed, the outbr eak o f hostilities. The Obser ver Group' s field trip along the Parallel ended on 23 June. Its statem ents about what took place afterward are eith er speculatio n or base d o n inform ation receiv ed from the South Korean governm ent or the US m ilitary. Moreover, early in the morning of the 26t h, the South Korean Office of Public Inform ation announced that Southern forces had indeed captured the North Korean town of Haeju. The announcem ent stated that the attack had occurred that same morning, but an Am erican m ilitary s tatus repor t as of nightfall on the 25th notes that all Southern territory west of the Im jin River had been los t to a depth of at least three m iles inside the border except in the ar ea of the Haeju \"counter attack\". In eithe r ca se, such a m ilitary vic tory on the part of the Southern f orces is extrem ely difficult to reconcile with the o fficial W estern account, m aintained to this day, that has the North Korean army sweepi ng south in a devastating surprise attack, taking control of everything that lay before it, and forcing South Korean troops to evacuate further sou th. Subsequently, the South Korean governm ent denied that its capture of Haeju had actually taken place, blam ing the original announcem ent, apparently, on an exaggera tin g m ili-ta ty off icer. One histor ian has ascrib ed the alle gedly incor rect announcem ent to \"an error due to poor communications, plus an attem pt to stiffen South Korean res istan ce by claim ing a victo ry\". W hatever actually lay behind the announcem ent, it is ev ident th at very litt le relian ce, if any, can be placed u pon statem ents m ade by the South Korean gove rnment concerning the start of the war. 4 There were, in fact, rep orts in the We stern press of the attack on Haeju which made no m ention of the South Korean governm ent's announcem ent, and which appear to be independent confirm ations of t he event.

On the 25th, Am erican writer John G unther was in Japan preparing his biography of General Douglas MacArthur. As he recounts in the book, he was playing tourist in the town of Nikko with \"two im por tant m embers\" of the Am erican occupation, when \"one of these was called unexpectedly to the telephone. He cam e back a nd whispered, ' A big story has just broken.

Gunther explains: \"The m essage m ay have been garbled in transm ission. Nobody knew anything m uch at headquarters the first few hours, and probably people were taken in by th e blatant, co rrosiv e lies of the North Korean radio.\" 5 There is so mething a little incong ruous about the picture o f Am erican m ilitary and diplom atic p ersonnel, practicing anti -communists each one, being taken in on so im portant a m atter by communist lies—blatant ones no less. The head of South Korea, Syngm an Rhee, had often expressed his desire and readin ess to com pel the unification of Korea by force. On 26 June the New York Ti mes rem inded its readers that \"on a num ber of occasions, Dr. Rhee has ind icated that h is arm y would have taken the offensive if W ashington had given the consent.\" The newspaper noted also that before the war began: \"The warlike talk strangely [had] alm ost all co me from South Korean leaders. \" Rhee m ay have had good reason for provoki ng a full-scale war apart from the issue of unif ication. On 30 May, elections for the National Assem bly were held in the South in which Rhee' s party suffered a heavy setback and lo st control of the assem bly. Like countless statesm en before and after hi m, Rhee m ay have decided to play the war card to rally support for his shaky rule. A la bor adviser attached to the Am erican aid mission in South Korea, Stanley Earl, resigned in July, expressing the opinion that the South Korean governm ent was \"an oppressive re gim e\" which \"did very little to help the people\" and that \"an internal South Korean rebellion against the Rhee Government would have occurred if the forces of North Korea had not invaded\". 6 Soviet leader Nikita Kh rushchev, in his rem iniscences, m akes it plain that the North Koreans had contemplated an invasion of the South for som e tim e and he reports their actual invasion without any m ention of provocation on that day.

For exam ple, Nor th Korean leader Kim Il-sung m et with Stalin to discuss Kim' s desire \"to prod S outh Korea with the point of a bayonet\". The book then states unam biguously: \"Kim went hom e and then returned to Moscow when he had worked everything out.\" In the tran script, however, Khrush chev says: \"In my opinion, either the date of his return was set, or he was to inform us as soon as he finished preparing all of his ideas.

The resolution was approved, although there were argum ents that \"this was a fight between Koreans\" and should be treated as a civil war, and a suggestion from th e Egyptian delegate that the word \"unprovoked\" should be dropped in view of the longstanding hostilitie s between the two Koreas. 8 Yugoslavia insisted as well that \"there se em ed to be lack of precise inform ation that cou ld enable the C ouncil to p in responsib ility \", and proposed that North Korea be invited to present its side of the story. 9 This was not done. (Three months later, the Soviet foreign m inister put fo rward a m otion that the UN hear representatives from both sides. This, too, was voted down, by a m argin of 46 to 6, because of North Korea' s \"aggression\", and it was decided to exte nd an invitation to South Korea alone.) 10 On the 27th, the Security Council recomm ended that m embers of the United Nations furnish assistance to South Korea \"as m ay be ne cessary to repel the arm ed attack\".

The Council m ade its historic decision with the barest of inform ation ava ilab le to it, and all of it d erived f rom and selected by only one side of the conflict. Th is was, as journalist I.F . Stone put it, \"neither honorable nor wise\". It should be kept in m ind that in 1950 the United Nations was in no way a neutral or balanced organization. The grea t m ajority of m embers were nations very dependent upon the United States for econom ic recovery or developm ent. There was no Third W orld bloc which years later pursued a UN policy m uch m ore independent of the United States. And only four countries of th e Soviet bloc were m embers at the tim e, none on the Security Council. 12 Neither could UN Secretary- General Trygve L ie, of Norway, be regarded as neutral in the m idst of cold war controvers y.

It further requested \"the United States to des ignate th e co mmander of such forces.\" 17 This would be the redoubtable MacArthur. It was to be an Am erican show. Milita ry personnel of som e 16 other countries took part in one way or another but, with the exception of the South Koreans, there could be little doubt as to their true stat us or function. E isenhower later wrote in his memoirs that when he was conside ring US milita ry inte rve ntion in Vie tnam in 1954, also as part of a \"coalition\", he recognized that the burden of the operation would fall on the United States, but \"the token forces suppl ied by these other nations, as in Korea, would lend real m oral standing to a venture that otherwise could be m ade to appear as a brutal example of im perialism \" (emphasis added). 18 The war, and a brutal one it was indeed, was fought ostensibly in defense of the Syngm an Rhee regim e. Outside of books published by various South K orean governm ents, it is rather difficult to find a kind word for the m an the United States brought back to Korea in 1945 after decades of exile in America during the Japanese occupation of his country. Flown into Korea in one of MacArthur' s airplanes, Rhee was soon m aneuvered into a position of prom inence and authority by the US Ar my Military Governm ent in Korea (U SAMGIK). In the proc ess, Am erican officials had to suppress a provisional governm ent, the Korean People' s Republic, that was the outgrowth of a num ber of regional governing com mittees se t up by prom inent Koreans and which had already begun to carry out adm inistrative tasks, such as food distribution and keeping order. The KPR' s offer of its services to the arriving Am ericans was dism issed out of hand. Despite its comm unis t-sounding nam e, the KPR included a number of conservatives; indeed, R hee him self had been given the leading position of chairm an. Rhee and the other conservatives, m ost of whom were still abroad when chos en, perhaps did not welco me the honor because the KPR, on balance, w as probably too lef tist for their taste s, as it was f or the higher ec helons of the USAMGIK. But af ter 35 years under the Japanese, any group or governm ent set up to undo the effects of colonialism had to have a revolutionary tinge to it. It was the conserv ative s in Korea who had collaborated with th e Japanese; leftists and other nationalists who had struggled ag ainst th em ; the m ake-up of the KPR necessarily reflected th is, and it w as reportedly more popular than any other political grouping. 19 Whatever the political leanings o r in tentions of the KPR, by denying it any \"authority, status or form \", 20 the USAMGIK was regulatin g Korean politica l lif e as if the country were a defeated enem y and not a friendly state liberated from a comm on foe and with a right to independence and self-determ ination. 48"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"The significance of shunting aside the KPR went beyond this.

Another reason ha s been suggested: to prevent the Korean People' s Republic from assum ing a m easure of power. 25 And while the North soon im ple mented wi desp read and effectiv e land reform and at least for mal equality for wom en, the Rhee regim e rem ained hostile to th ese ideals. Two years later, it en acted a land reform m easure, but this app lied only to f ormer Japanese property. A 1949 law to covet other ho ldings was not enforced at all, and the abuse of land tenants continue d in both old and new for ms. 26 Public resentm ent against the US/Rhee adm inistration was aroused because of these po licies as well as b ecau se of the supp ression of the KPR and som e very question able elections. So relu ctan t was Rhee to allow an ho nest election , that by early 1950 he had becom e enough of an em barrassmen t to the United States for W ashington officials to threaten to cut off aid if he faile d to do so and also im prove the state of civil liberties. Apparently because of th is pressu re, th e elections held on May 30 were fair enough to allow \" moderate\" elem ents to participate, and, as m entioned earlier, the Rhee governm ent was decisively repudiated. 27 The resentm ent was m anifested in the fo rm of frequent rebellions, including som e guerrilla warfare in the hills, from 1946 to the beginning of the war, and even during the war. The rebellions were di sm issed by the governm ent as \"comm unist- inspired\" an d repressed accord ingly, but, as Joh n Gunther o bserved, \"It can be safely said that in the eyes of Hodge [the comma nder of US forces in Korea] and Rhee, particularly at the beginning, almost a ny Korean not an ex treme rightist was a communist and potential traitor.\" 28 General Hodge evidently perm itted US troops to take part in the rep ression. Mark Gayn, a correspondent in Korea fo r the Chicago Sun, wrote that Am erican soldiers \"fired on crowds, conducted m ass arre sts, com bed the hills f or suspects, and organized posses of Korean rightists, c onstabulary and police for m ass raids.\" 29 Gayn rela ted tha t one of Hodge' s politica l adviser s as sured him (Gayn) that Rhee was not a fascist: \"He is two cen turies before fascism —a pure Bourbon.\" 30 49"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Describing the governm ent's anti-gue rrilla campaign in 1948, pro-Western political scientist John Kie-Chiang Oh of Ma rquette University has written: \"In these cam paigns, the civil liberties of countless persons were often ignored. Frequently, hapless villagers, suspected of aiding the guerillas, were summ arily executed.\" 31 A year la ter, when a comm ittee of the Nationa l Ass embly launched an investigatio n of collabo rator s, Rhee had his police raid the Assem bly: 22 people w ere arrested, of whom 16 were later found to have suffered either broken ribs, skull injuries or broken eardrum s. 32 At the tim e of the outbreak of war in June 1950, there were an estim ated 14,000 political prisoners in South Korean jails. 33 Even during the height of the war, in February 1951, reported Professor Oh, there was the \"Koch' ang Incident\", again involving suspicion of aiding guerrillas, \"in which about six hundred m en and wom en, young and old, were herded into a narrow valley and mowed down with m achine guns by a South Korean arm y unit.\" 34 Throughout the war, a continuous b arrag e of accusations was leveled by each side at the other, charging the enemy with engaging in all m anner of barbarity and atrocity, against troops, prisoners of war, and civilian s alike, in every pa rt of the country (each s ide o ccupied the other' s territory at tim es), try ing to outdo each other in a v erbal war of superlatives alm ost as heated as th e com bat. In the United States this produced a body of popular m yths, not unlike those em erging from other wars which are widely supported at hom e. (By contrast, during the Vietnam War the inclin ation of myths t o flourish was regularly countered by num erous educated protestors who carefully researched the origins of the war, monitore d its conduct, and public ized studies sharply at varian ce with th e official version(s), ev entua lly inf luenc ing the m ass m edia to do the sam e.) There was, for exam ple, the consen sus that the brutality of the war in Korea must be laid overwhelm ingly on the doorstep of the North Koreans.

The New York Times reported a \"wave of [South Korean] Governm ent execu tions in Seoul\" in Dece mber 1950.36 Re ne Cutforth, a correspondent for the BBC in Kor ea, later wrote of \"t he shooting without trial of civilians, designated by the police as ' communist' . These executions were done, usually at dawn, on any patch of waste gr ound where you could dig a trench and line up a row of prisoners in front of it.\" 37 And Gregory Henderson, a US diplom at who served seven years in Korea in the 1940s and ' 50s , has stated that \"probably over 100,000 we re killed witho ut any tr ial whatsoever \" by Rh ee' s forces in the South during the war. 38 Following s ome of the m assacres of civilian s in the South, the Rhee gov ernm ent turned around and attributed them to Northern troops.

At the same tim e, the CIA repor tedly was targeting a single individual for term ination —North Korean leade r Kim II Sung. W ashington sent a C herokee Indian, code-nam ed Buffalo, to Hans V. Tofte, a CI A o fficer sta tio ned in Japan, after Buffalo had agreed to serve as Ki m II Sun g's assassi n. Buf falo was to rece ive a cons ider able am ount of money if his m issi on succeeded. It obviously did not, and nothing further has been revealed about the incident. 40 Another widely-he ld b elief in the United States dur ing the war was that Am erican prisoners in North Korean cam ps were dying off lik e flies because of Communist neglect and cruelty. The flam es of this very em oti onal issue were fanned by the tendency of US officials to exaggera te the num bers involved. During Nove mber 1951, for exam ple—long before the end of the war—Am erican m ilitary announcem ents put the count of POW deaths at between 5,000 and 8,000. 41 However, an extensive study com pleted by the US Ar my two years af ter the war revealed that the POW death toll for the entire war was 2,730 ( out of 7,190 held in camps; an unknown num ber of other p rison ers nev er m ade it to th e cam ps, being sho t in the fie ld b ecause of the inconvenience of dealing with them in the m idst of com bat, a practice engaged in by both sides). The study concluded that \"there was evid ence that the high death rate was not due prim arily to Communist m altreatm ent... it could be accounted for largely by the ignorance or the callousness of the prisoners themselves.\" 42 \"Callousness\" refers here to the soldiers' lack of morale and collectiv e spirit. Although not m entioned in the study, the North Koreans, on s everal occas ions, clai med that m any Am erican POW s also died in the c amps as a resu lt o f the heavy US bom bing. The study of course could never begin to ca tch up with all the scare headlines to which the Western world had been treated for three y ears. Obscured as well was th e fact that sever al tim es as m any Comm unist p risoners had died in US/South Korean cam ps— halfway through the w ar the o fficial figure stood at 6,600 43 —though these cam ps did hold m any more prisoners than those in the North. The Am erican public w as also con vinced, and probably still is, that the North Koreans an d Chinese h ad \"brainwashed\" US s oldiers. This sto ry aros e to explain the fact that as m any as 30 percen t of Am erican POWs had collaborated with the enem y in one way or another, and \"one m an i n every sev en, or m ore than thirte en per cent, w as guilty of serious collabo ration—writing dis loya l tracts ... o r agreeing to s py or organ ize for the Communists af ter the wa r.\" 44 Another reason the brainwashing them e was prom oted by W ashington was to increase the likelihood that statem ents m ade by returning prisoners which questioned the official version of the war would be discounted. 51"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"In the words of Yale psychiatrist R obe rt J. Lifton, brainwashing was popularly held to be an \"all-powerful, irresistible, unfathom able, and m agical m ethod of achieving total control ove r the hum an m ind.\" 45 Although the CIA experim ented, beginning in the 1950s, to develop just such a m agic, neither they nor the No rth Koreans or Chinese ever possessed it. The Agency began its \"behavior-control\" or \"m ind-control\" experim ents on hum an s ubjects (probably suspected double agents), using dr ugs and hypnosis, in Japan in July 1950, shortly afte r the beginning of the Korean W ar. In October, they apparently used North Korean prisoners of war as subjects. 46 In 1975, a US Navy psychologist, Lt. Com . Thom as Narut, re vealed that his na val work inclu ded estab lish ing how to induce servicemen who m ay not be naturally incline d to kill, to do so under certain conditions. He referred to these m en using the words \"hitm en\" and \"assas sin\". Narut adde d that conv icted m urderers as well had been released from military pr isons to beco me assassins. 47 Brainwashing, said the Ar my study, \"has becom e a catch phrase, used for so many things that it no longer has any preci se m eaning\" and \"a precise m eaning is necessa ry in this c ase. 48 The pri soners , as far as Arm y psy chiatrists have bee n able to di sco ver, w ere not sub ject ed to anything that coul d p rope rly be cal led brai nwas hing.

This could reflect eith er a greater Communist resentm ent about the use of such a weapon, or a need to produce som e kind of corroborat ion of a false or questionable claim . Am erican servicem en were also s ubject ed to politica l ind octr ination by their jailers. He re is how the US Arm y saw it: In t he i ndoctrinat ion l ect ures, the C ommuni sts fre que ntly di spl ayed global chart s dotted with ou r military b ases, th e n ames of wh ich were of course kno wn to m any of t he ca ptives. \"See t hose bases ?\" the i nstructor w oul d say , tappi ng them on t he chart with his poi nter. \"They are Am erican —fu ll o f war materiel.

The extended a nd bitter negotiations gave rise to another pervasive Western belief—that it was predominantly Communist in transigence, duplicity, and lack of peaceful intentions which frus trated the talks and prolonged the war. This is a lengthy and entangled chapter of the Korean W ar story, but one does not have to probe too deeply to dis cover th e u nrem arkable fact tha t th e barr ier s were erected by the anti-Communist side as we ll.

Did Korea or China or any other foreign power send in an arm y to slaughter Am ericans, chargin g Lincoln with aggression? Why did the United States choose to wage full-scale war in Korea? Only a year earlier, in 1949, in the Arab-Is raeli fighting in Palestine an d in the India-Pakistani war over Kashmir, the United Nations, with Am eri can support, had intervened to m ediate an arm istice, not to send in an arm y to take sides and expand the fighting.

Albania 1949-1953 The proper English spy \"To sim ultaneously plan and sabotage this ill-fated venture m ust have been a severe test of his energy and ingenuit y,\" wrote one of Kim Philby' s biographers. 1 The venture was the clandestine attem pt, be gun in 1949, by the United S tates and Great Britain to overthrow the pro-Soviet regim e of Enver Hoxha through guerrilla-fomented uprisings. It end ed in disaster, in part b ecaus e th e Russ ian s had app arently b een alerted by Philby, the proper Englishm an who had gone to all the right schools and penetrated the highest rank s of British and Am erican intelligence, though he had been a Soviet s py since the age of 21. Philby had moved to Washington the year before to act as the Britis h Secret Inte llig ence Service (S IS} liaison to the CIA. In that capac ity he served as a co-dire ctor of the CIA-SIS task force engaged in plan ning the Albanian operation. The choice had fallen upon Albania because it was regarded as the m ost vulnerable of the socialist states, the sm allest and the w eakest, not sharing a border with the Soviet Union, isolate d between a U S-contro lled Greece and a Yugoslav ia that was a renegad e from the Soviet bloc. Mo reo ver, a recent agreem ent between the Soviet Union and Albania involved aid for Albania in return for a Soviet rig ht to build a subm arine base with d irect acces s to the Mediterranean. 2 By the rules and logic of the cold-war board gam e, this was a m ove the United S tate s was obliged to thw art. 54"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"The task force began by recruiting scat tered Albanian ém igrés who were living in Italy, Greece and elsewhere.

Am erican planes and balloons dropped propaganda leaf lets and goods as well, such item s in scarce supp ly in Albania as flour, halva h, needles, and razor blades, along with a note announc ing that they were a gift from the \"Albanian National Liberation F ront\" 5 —another instance of the subtle \"m arketing\" touch that the CIA, born and raised in Am erica, was to br ing to so m any of its operations. In outline, the plan, or the hope, was for the guerrillas to m ake for their old hom e regions and try to stir up an ti-Soviet and a nti-Comm unist sen tim ents, eventu ally leading to uprisings. They were to distri bute propaganda, obtain political, econom ic and military info rm ation, engage in sabo tage, recruit individuals into cells, an d supply them with equip ment. Later inf usions of m en a nd m aterial would expand these cells into \"centers of resistance\". 6 Cold-war conventional wisdom dictated ch at the m asses of Eastern Europ e were waiting to be sparked into ope n reb ellion f or the ir freedom . Even if this were the c ase, the choice of ignition was highly dubious, for the guerrillas included a mongst their num bers m any who sup ported a rein stitu tion of the Albanian m onarchy in the person of the r eac tion ary King Zo g, then in exile, and others who had collabo rated with the Italian fascists or Nazis during their wartim e occupations of Albania. To be sure, there were those of r epub lican and dem ocratic le anings in the various ém igré comm ittees as well, but Stat e Departm ent papers, later declassified, reveal that prom inent Albanian co llabo rato rs played leading roles in the f orm ation of these committees. These were individuals the State Departm ent characterized as hav ing \"som ewhat checkered\" political backgrounds who \"m ight sooner or later occasion em barrassment to th is g overnm ent\". They we re adm itted to the United States over the Departm ent's objections because of \"inte llig ence consideratio ns\". One of the checke red gentlem en was Xhafer Deva, m inister of in terior during the Ita lian occupation, who had been responsible for deporta tions of \"Jews, Comm unists, partisans and suspicious persons\" (as a captu red Nazi report put it) to exterm ination cam ps in Poland. 7 In the name of the CI A-funded National Committee for a Free Albania, a powerful underground radio station began broa dcasting inside the country, calling for the nation' s liberation from the Soviet Uni on. In early 1951, several reports cam e out of Albania of open organized resistance and uprisings. 8 To what extent these happenings were a cons equence of the W estern inf iltra tion a nd agita tion is im possible to dete rm ine. Overall, the cam paign had little to show for its efforts.

Philby, referring to th e CIA- SIS task force m embers' habit of poking fun at Albanian s, wrote: \"Even in our m ore serious m oments, we Anglo-Saxons never forgot that our agents were just down from the trees.\" 9 So lax was security that New York Times correspondent C yrus I.. Sulzberger filed several dispatches from the Medite rranean area touching upon the intervention which required virtually no read ing between the lines. 10 (The articles carried no attention-grabbing headlines, there wa s no public comm ent about them from Washington, no reporters asked governm ent officials any embarrassing questions ... ergo: a \"non-event\" for Am ericans.) Despite one failure after another, and without good reason to expect anything different in the future, th e operation conti nued u ntil the spring of 1953, resulting in the death or imprisonm ent of hundreds of men. It was not simply the obsession with chopping off one of Stalin' s fingers. Professiona l prestige and careers had been invested, a visible success was needed to \"recoup pa st losses\" and \"jus tify earlier decisions\". 11 And the m en who were being lost were, after all, only Albanians, who spoke not a word of the Queen' s English, and did not yet walk upright properly. There was, however, th e danger of the ac tion escalating into conf lict with the Soviet Union. The Soviets did in fact send som e new fi ghter planes to Albania, presum ably in the hope that they could shoot down the foreign aircraft m aking drops. 12 The operation could not fail to remind Stalin, Hoxha, and the entire socialist bloc of another W estern intervention 30 years earlier in the Soviet Union. It could only serve to make the m yet m ore \"paranoid\" about W ester n intentions and convince them to turn the screw of internal s ecur ity yet tigh ter. Indeed, every now and again over the ensuing years, Hoxha m entioned the Am erican and Br itish \"invasion\" and used it to justify his policy of isolation. 13 In the early 1960s, Hoxha him self did what the CIA and SIS had failed to do: He pulled Albania out of the Soviet orbit. The Albanian leader purged pro-Soviet officials in his governm ent and aligned his country w ith China. There was no m ilitary retaliation on the part of the USSR. In the m id-1970s, Hoxha forsook China as well. 7. Eastern Europe 1948-1956 Operation Splinter Factor Jozef Swiatlo surfaced at a p ress c onference in W ashington on 28 Septem ber 1954.

The OSS aided the operation financially; the Communists in turn were an excellent source of inform ation about happenings in Europe of interest to Washington and its allies. Toward the end of the war, Field indu ced Dulles to provide Am erican support for a project which placed agents in various European countries to prepare the way for the advan cing Allied troops. The m en chosen by Field, unsurpris ingly, were all Communists and their placem ent in certain Eastern European countries helped them to get their hands on the reins of power long be fore non-Communist forces were able to regroup and organize them selves. It could be concluded from this that Allen Dulles had been duped. Moreover, the OSS, under Dulles' s direction and again with Field involved, had financed the publica tion of a clande stine n ewspaper inside Germ any; anti -fascis t and left-wing, the paper was called Neues Deutschland , and imm ediately u pon lib eration becam e the official newspaper of the Ea st Germ an Comm unist Party. Af ter the war these inc idents served as jokes which intelligen ce servic es of both East and West could and did appreciate. Before long, the joke fell heavily upon Noel Field. In 1949 when Field visited Poland he wa s regarded with grave suspicion by Polish autho rities. He was seen to have worked during the war in a positio n which could easily have been a front for W estern espi onage, a position which brought him into regular contact with senior Communist Party m embers; and he had, after all, worked closely with Allen Dulles, fa mous already as a spym aster, and the brother of John Foster Dulles, pro minent in W ashington off icial circles and already m aking his calls for the \"liberation\" of the Soviet bloc nations. At the tim e of Field' s arrival in Po land, Jozef Swiatlo was looking to implicate Jakub Berman, a high party and state official whom Swia tlo was suspicious of and detested. It was his failure to convince the Po lish president to act against Berm an that reportedly drove Swiatlo to try to defect th e year before. When Noel Field wrote to Berm an asking his help in obtaining a job in Eastern Europe, Sw iatlo learn ed of the letter and saw his chance to nail Berm an. But first N oel Field had to be establ ished as an Am erican spy. Given the circum stantial ev idence pointing in that dire ction, that would not be too difficult for a man of Swiatlo' s high position and low ch aracter. Of course, if Field really was working with US intelligence, S wiatlo couldn' t ve ry well be exposing him si nce the Polish security officer was no w him self an Am erican agent. Accordingly, he sent his first message to the CIA, describing his plan a bou t Berm an and Field and the harm it could do to the Communist Party in Poland. He concluded with: \"A ny objections?\" 57"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Allen Dulles had none. His reactio n to Sw iatlo 's message was one of pleasure and am usem ent. The tim e had com e to settle accounts with Noel Field. More im portantly, Dulles sa w that Swiatlo, us ing Noel Field, \"the Am erican spy\", as a bludgeon could knock off countless leading Communist officials in the Soviet bloc. It could put the whole of the bl oc in to a state of acute paranoia and set off a wave of repression and Stalinist tyranny that could even tually lead to upris ings. Dulles called his plan: Operation Splin ter Factor. Thus it was that Jozef Swiatlo was direc ted to f ind spies ev erywhere in Eastern Europe. He would uncover Am erican plots and British p lots , \"Trotsky ist\" conspirac ies and \"Titoist\" conspiracies. He woul d report to Soviet secret-police chief Lavrenti Beria him self that at the center of the vast ne twork was a m an na med Noel Haviland Field. Field was arrested and wound up i n a pris on in Hungary, as did his wife Herta when she cam e looking for hi m. And when his brother Herm ann Field sought to track down the two of them , he m et the sam e fate in Poland. Swiatlo was in a un ique position to c arry ou t Ope ration Splin ter Facto r. N ot only did he have the aut hority and command, he had the file s on countless C omm unist Party members in the blo c cou ntries. Any connecti on they had had with Noel Field, anything that Field had done, could be interpreted to show the hand of Americ an intelligence or an act of real or potential subversion of the socialist stat es. The Soviets, and Stalin him self, were extrem ely interested in th e \"Fieldists\". Noel Field had known almost everyone w ho was anyone in the Soviet bloc. just in ca se the level of paranoia in th e infant, insecure gov ernm ents of Eastern Europe was not high enough, a CIA double agent would \"corr oborate\" a vital piece of inform ation, or introduce the ri ght rum or at the right tim e; or the Agency' s Radio Free Europe would broadcast certain tantalizi ng, seem ingly-coded m essages; or the CIA would direct the writing of letters from \"Eas t European expatria tes\" in the United States to leading C omm unists in their homelands, containing just the bit of inform ation, or the phrase, caref ully designed to lift th e eyebrows of a security of ficer. Many of th e vic tim s of Swiatlo' s purges were people who had spent the war years in the W est rathe r than in th e Sovi et Union and thus had crossed Field' s path. These were people who tended to be m ore natio nalis t Communists, who wanted to put greater distance between their countries a nd the Soviet Union, as Tito had done in Yugoslavia, and who favored a m ore liberal regim e at hom e. Dulles brushed aside the argum ent that these were peopl e to be supported, not elim inated. He fe lt that they were potentially the m ore dangerous to the W est because if their form of Communis m were allowed to gain a foothold in Eastern Europe then Comm unis m m ight becom e respec table and acc epted; p articu larly with Italy and F rance threatening to v ote Communists into power, Communism had to be shown at its worst. There were hundreds of trials all over Eastern Europe—\"show trials\" and lesser specta cles— in which the nam e of Noel Fie ld played an im portant part. W hat Operation Splinter Factor began soon took on a life of its own: following the arrest of a highly- placed p erso n, others fell under susp icion because they kn ew him or had been appoin ted by hi m; or any other connection to an arre sted person m ight serve to implicate som e unlucky soul. Jozef Swiatlo had his counter part in Czechoslovakia, a m an fi rm ly entrenched in the upper ru ngs of the Czech security appara tus. The m an, whose name is no t kno wn, had been recruited by General Reinhard Gehle n, the for mer Nazi in telligence chief who went to wor k for the CIA af ter the war. When, in October 1956, the uprising in Hungary occurred, th ese m en, according to the CIA, were not used because they we re no t yet ready.1 4 But the Agency did send 58"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"its agents in Budapest into action to join the r ebels and help organize them .15 In the meanti me, RFE was exhorting the Hungarian people to continue their resistance, offering tactical advic e, and im plying that Am erican m ilitary assis tance w as on the wa y. It never cam e. There is no evidence that Operation Splinter Factor co ntributed to the Hungarian uprising or to the earlier ones in Poland a nd East Germ any. Nonetheless, the CIA could point to all the cold-war, an ti-Communist prop aganda point s it had won because of the witch hunts in the East, the hum an cost notwithstanding. Czechoslovakia was the worst case. By 1951 a n unbelievable 169,000 card- carry ing m embers of the Czech Communist Part y had been arrested— ten percen t of the entire m embership. There were tens of thousands m ore in Poland, Hungary, East Germ any, a nd Bulgaria. Hundreds were put to death, others died in prison or went insane. 2 After Swiatlo defected in Decem ber 1953, Ea st European in telligence services cam e to realize that he had been working fo r the other side all along. Four weeks after Swiatlo held his W ashington press conference, the Polish governm ent announced that it was releasing Herm ann Field because investig ation had revealed th at the charges wh ich had been brought against him by \"a n Am erican agent and provocateur\", Jozef Swiatlo, were \"baseless\". 3 Field was later paid $50,000 f or his im prisonm ent as well as having his convalescence at a sanitorium paid for. 4 Three week s after Herm ann Field's release, Noel and Herta Field were freed in Hungary. The governm ent in Budapest stated th at it could not justify the charges against them . 5 They were also com pensated a nd chose to rem ain in Hungary. Once Noel Field had been officially declared innocent, the cases of countless others in East Europe had to be reviewed. Fi rst in trick les, th en in rushes , the prisone rs were released. By 1956 the vast m ajority stood outside prison walls. Throughout the decade following th e war, the CIA was fa nning the flam es of discontent in Eastern Europe in m any ways ot her than Operation Splinter Facto r. R adio Free Europe (RFE, cf. Soviet Union chapte r), broadcasting from W est Germ any, never missed a (dirty) trick. In January 1952, for exam ple, after RFE learned that Czechoslovakia was planning to devalue it s currency, it w arned the population, thus stim ulating a nation-wide buying panic. 6 RFE' s comm entaries abou t various Eu rop ean Communists were described by Blanche W iesen Cook in her study of the period, The Declassified Eisenhower. She wrote that the broadcasts: invo lved a wi de ran ge of person al cr iticis m, tawd ry an d slan derous attack s ran ging f rom rum ors of brutality and t orture , to corruption, a nd t o madness, per version, an d vi ce.

Needless to say, the born-again hum anitarian made no m ention of Splinter Factor or his double role, although som e of his broadcasts reportedly shook up the Polish secu rity system for the better. 8 Any way the US could stir up tro uble and nu isance ... su pporting op position groups in Rum ania 9 ... setting up an underground radio station in Bulgaria 10 ... dropping propaganda from balloons over Hungary, Czec hoslovakia, and Poland (on one day in August 1951 alone, 11,000 balloon s carrying 1 3 m illion leaflets) 11 ... dr opping people as 59"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"well: f our Am erican air men, presum ably intelligence oper ative s, landing in Hungary 12 ...

Germany 1950s Everything from juvenile delinquency to terrorism Within a period of 30 ye ars and two world wars with Germ any, the Soviet Union suffered m ore than 40 million dead and w ounded, enorm ous devastation to its land, and its cities razed to the ground. At the close of the Second W orld W ar, the Russians w ere not kindly disposed tow ard the Germ an people. W ith their own country to rebuild, they placed the reconstruction of Ger many fa r down on their list of priorities. The United States em erged from the war with relatively m inor casualties and its territory completely un scathed. It was ready, willing and ab le to devote itself to its main prior ity in E urope: the b uilding of an anti-C ommunist bulw ark in the West, particularly in the strategic location of Ger many. In 1945, form er Secretary of State Dean Acheson has written, official Am erican policy was explic itly \" to bri ng hom e to the Germ ans that they could not escape the suffering they had brought upon them selves ... [and] to control [the] Germ an economy to ... prevent any higher standard of living than in neighboring nations.\" 1 \"From the outset,\" Acheson added, US offi cials in Germ any believed this plan \"to be unworkable\". 2 Acheson did not explain what lay behind this prognosis, but its correctness soon becam e apparent for th ree dis tinct reasons : (1) influential Am erican business and financial leaders, som e of them occ upying im portan t gov ernm ent positions, h ad too great a stake in a highly-industrialized Ger many (usually dating back to before the war) to allow the country to sink to the depths that som e Am erican policy-m akers advocated as punishm ent; (2) a revitalized W est Germ any was seen as an indispensable m eans of com batting Soviet influ ence in the Eastern sect or of the country, if not in all of Eastern Europe. W est Germ any was to becom e \"the showcase of W estern dem ocracy\"— dram atic, living proof of the superiority of cap italism over socialism ; (3) in Am erican conservative circles, an d som e lib eral ones as well, wherein a S oviet invasion of Western Europe rem ained perpetually imm inent, the idea of tying West Germ any's industrial hands was one which ca me perilous ly close to being \"soft on c omm unis m\", if not worse. 3 Dwight Eisenhower echoed this last sentim ent when he later wrote: Had certai n officials in the Roose velt adm inistrat ion h ad t heir way , Germ any wo uld ha ve be en far wo rse o ff, f or there w ere those wh o adv ocat ed the fl oodi ng of t he R uhr mines, t he w recki ng o f Ger man fact ories, and t he re ducing of Germ any from an i ndustrial to an a gricul tural nat ion.

At the sam e tim e, the Soviet Union was pouring m assive econom ic assistance out of East Germ any. The Soviets dism antle d and m oved back hom e entire factories with large amounts of equipm ent and m achin ery, and thousands of m iles of railroad track. W hen added to war reparations, the to ll r eached into th e bi llions of dollars. By the early 1950s, though social services, em ploym ent, and cultural life in East Germ any were on a par or superior to that in W est Germ any, the W estern sector had the edge in tho se are as of prosper ity with the most sex appeal: salaries were higher, the eating was better, consum er goods more avai lable, and the neon lights em blazoned the nights along the Kurfürstendamm. Am erican cold warriors , however, as if dis conte nt with the ga me score or with leaving so much to chance, instituted a crude cam paign of sabotage and subversion against East Germ any designed to throw th e econom ic and adm inistrative m achinery out of gear. The CIA and other US intelligen ce and m ilitary services in W est Germ any (with oc cas ional he lp f rom the like s of British , inte lligenc e and the W est German police) recruited, equipped, trained and fina nced Germ an activist groups and individuals of W est and East. Finding recruits for such a crusade was n ot difficult, for in post-war Germ any, a nti-communism lived on as the on ly respectable ves tige of Naziism . The m ost active of these groups, which went by the nam e of Fighting Group Against Inh umanity, ad mitted that it h ad r eceived financial suppo rt from the Ford Foundation and the West Berlin governm ent. 5 Subsequently, an East Berlin news magazine published a copy of a letter from the Ford Foundation confirm ing a grant of $150,000 to the National Comm ittee for a Free Europe \"so th at it, in turn, could supp ort the hum anitarian activities of ' The Fighting Group Against Inhum anity' .\" 6 The Nation al! Comm ittee for a Free Europe, in turn, was a CIA front organization which also ran Radio Free Europe. 7 The Association of Political Refugees from the East, and the Investigating Comm ittee of Freedom -m inded Jurists of the S oviet Zone, were two of the other groups involved in the cam paign against East Ge rm any. The actions carried out by these operatives ran the spectrum from juvenile delinquency to terrorism ; anything \"to m ake the comm ies look bad\".

Although many hundreds of the American ag ents were caught and tried by Eas t Germ any, the ease with which they could pass back and forth between the two sectors and infiltrate different enterprises w ithout any language barrier prov ided opportunities for the CIA unm atched anywhere else in Eastern Europe. Throughout the 1950s, the East Germ ans and the Soviet Union repeatedly lodged complaints with the Soviets' erstwhile allies in the West and with the United Nations about specific sabotage and espionage activ ities and called f or the closure of the offices in West Germany they claim ed were responsible, and for which they provided nam es and addresses. Inevitably the East Ge rm ans began to tighten up entry into the country from the W est. The W est also bedevile d the East with a vigorous cam pai gn of recruiting East Germ an professionals and skilled workers. Ev entually, this led to a s evere labo r and production crisis in the East, and in A ugust 1961, to the building of the infam ous Berlin Wall. While staging their commando attack s upon East Germ any, Am erican authorities and their Germ an agents were a pparently convinced that the Soviet Union had belligerent designs upon W est Germ any; perhaps a textbook case of projection. On 8 October 1952, the Minister-President of the W est Germ an state of Hesse, Georg August Zinn, disclosed that the United States had created a secret civilian arm y in his state for the purpose of resisting a R ussian invasion. This force of between 1,000 and 2,000 m en belonged to the so-called \"T echnical Service\" of the Germ an Youth Federation, th e latter characterized by the New York Tim es as \"a Right-wing youth group frequently charged with extrem ist activities\" (a ref erence to the ter rorist tactics desc ribed a bov e). The s talwarts of th e Technical Serv ice were hardly youths, however, for almost all appeared to be between 35 and 50 and most, said Zinn, were \"form er officers of t he Luft waffe, the W ehrm acht and t he S.S. [Hitler' s Black-sh irts]\". For m ore than a year they had received Am erican tr aining in infantry weapons and explosives and \"political instruction\" in sm all groups at a secluded site in the countrys ide and at a US m ilitary ins tallation. The intellig ence wing o f the Technical Serv ice, the s tate president revealed, had drawn up lists and card indexes of persons w ho were to be \"put out of the way\" when the Soviet tanks began to roll.

It was this m urder that led to the exposure of the entire operation. The United States adm itted its role in the creation and training of the guerrilla arm y, but denied any involvem ent in the \"illeg al, internal, and politic al acti vities\" of t he organization. But Zinn reported that the Am ericans had learned of the plotting in May and had not actually diss olved the group until Septem ber, the sa me m ont h that German Security Police arrested a num ber of the gr oup' s leaders. At som e point, the Am erican who directed the training courses. Ster ling Garwood, had been \"supplied with carbon copies of the card -ind ex entries \". It app ears that at no tim e did US authorities communicate anything of this m atter to the W est Germ an Governm ent. As the affair turned out, those who had b een attested were q uickly released and the United States thwarted any further inve stigation in th is the Am erican Zone of occupied G erm any. Commented Herr Zinn: \"The only legal explanation for these releases can be that the p eople in Karlsruhe [t he Federal Court] declared that they acted upon Am erican direction.\" 9 To add to the f uror, the nationa l leader of the Social Democrats accused the United States of financing an oppo sition g roup to infiltrate and underm ine his party. Erich Ollenhauer, whose nam e had also a ppeared on th e Technical Service' s lis t, im plied that Am erican \"clandestine\" agen cies were behind th e plot despite the disapproval of high-ranking US offic ials. 10 The revelations about the secret army a nd its hit-list resulted in a storm of ridicule and denunciatio n falling up on the Unit ed States from m any quarters in West Germ any.

Iran 1953 Making it safe for the King of Kings \"So this is how we get rid of that madm an Mossadegh,\" announced John Foster Dulles to a group of t op W ashington policy m akers one day in June 1953. 1 The Secretary of State held in his hand a plan of operation to overthro w th e prim e m inister of Iran prepared by Kerm it (Ki m) Rooseve lt of the CIA. There was scarcely any discussion amongst the high-powered m en in the room , no probing questions, no legal or eth ical iss ues raised. \"This was a grave decision to have m ade,\" Roosevelt later wrote. \"It involved trem endous risk. Surely it deserved thorough exam ination, the closest consideration, som ewhere at the very highest level. It had not received such thought at this m eeting. In 63"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"fact, I was morally certain that alm ost half of those present, if they had felt f ree o r had the courage to speak, would ha ve opposed the undertaking.\" 2 Roosevelt, the grandson of Theodore and distant cousin of Franklin, was expressing surprise m ore than disappointm ent at glim psing Am erican foreign-policy- making undressed. The original initiative to oust Mossadegh had com e from the British, for the eld erly Iran ian leader ha d spear headed the parliam entary m ove ment to nationa lize the British -owne d Anglo-Iranian Oil Com pany (AIOC), the sole oil com pany operating in Iran, In March 1951, the bill for n ationalization was passed, and at the end of April Mossadegh was elected prim e m inister by a lar ge m ajority of Parliam ent, On 1 May, nationalization went in to effect. The Iranian people, Mossadegh declared, \"w ere opening a hidden Tr easure upon which lies a dragon\". 3 As the pr im e m inister had antic ipate d, the British did not tak e th e national Nation grace-fully, though it was supported unani mously by the Iranian parliam ent and by the overwhelm ing m ajority of the Irani an people for reasons of both econom ic justice and national pride. The Mossadegh governm ent tried to do all the right things to placa te the British : It offered to set aside 25 percen t of the net prof its of the oil operation as com pensa tion; it guaranteed th e saf ety and the jobs of the British em ployees; it was willin g to sell its oil wit hout disturbance to the tidy control system s o dear to the hearts of the in ternational oil giants. But the British would have none of it. What they wanted was their oil co mpany back. And they wanted Mos sadegh' s head. A servant does not affront his lord with im punity. A m ilita ry show of force by the British nav y was f ollo wed by a r uthless international econom ic blockade an d boycott, and a freezing of Iranian assets which brought Iran' s oil exports and foreign trade to a virtual standstill, plunged the already im poverished country into near destitu tion, an d m ade paym ent of any com pensa tio n im possible. Nonetheless, and long after th ey had m oved to oust Mossadegh, the British dem anded c ompensation not only for the physical assets of the AIOC, but for the value of their enterprise in devel oping the oil fields; a request im possible to meet, and, in the eyes of Iran ian nationalists, som ething which decades of huge British p rofits had p aid for m any tim es over. The British attem pt at econom ic strangulat ion of Iran could not have gotten off the ground without the active co-operation and support of the Trum an and Eisenhower adm inistrations and Am erican oil com panies . At the sam e ti me, the Truman adm inistration argued with the British that Mossadegh' s collapse could open the door to the proverbial comm uni st takeover. 4 W hen the British were late r expe lled f rom Iran, however, they had no alternativ e but to turn to the United States for ass istan ce in toppling Mossadegh. In Nove mber 1952, the Churchill governm ent approached Roosevelt, the de facto head of the CIA' s Middle East di vision, who told the British that he felt that there was \"n o chance to win approval from the outgoing adm inistration of Trum an and Acheson. The new Republicans, however, m ight be quite different.\" 5 John Foster Dulles was certainly different . The apocalyptic anti-comm unist saw in Mossad egh the ep itom e of all that he detested in the Third W orld: unequivocal neutra lism in the co ld w ar, to ler ance of Co mmunists, and disrespect for free ent erprise, as dem onstrated by the oil nationalization. (Iro nically, in recent years Great Britain had nationalized several of its ow n basic industries, and the go vernm ent was the m ajority owner of th e AIOC.) To the likes of John Foster Dulles, the eccentric Dr. Mohammed Mossadegh was indeed a m adm an. And when th e Secretary of State co nsidered further that Iran was a nation exceeding ly rich in th e liquid gold, and that it sh ared a bo rder with the Soviet Union more than 1,000 m iles long, he was not unduly plagued by indecision as to whether the Iranian prim e m inister should finally re tire from public life. 64"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"As matters turned out, the overthrow of Mossadegh in August 1953 was m uch more an Am erican operation than a British one.

He called his book Countercoup to press hom e the idea that the CIA coup was staged only to prev ent a tak eover of power by the Iranian Communist Party (The Tudeh) closely backed by the Soviet Uni on. Roos evelt was thus arguing that Mossadegh had to be rem oved to prevent a Comm unist takeover, whereas the Truma n adm inistration had felt that Mossadegh had to be kept in pow er to prevent one.

Mossadegh' s \"increasing dependence on the Soviet Union\" ... \"the hand of the Tude h, and behind them the Russians, is showing m ore openly every day\" ... \"Russi an backing of the Tudeh and Tudeh backing of [Mos sadegh] becam e ever more obvious\" ... the Soviet Union was \"ever m ore active in Iran. Their control over Tudeh leadership was growing stronger all the tim e. It was exercised often a nd, to our eyes, with deliberate ostentation\" ... 6 But none of this subversive and threateni ng activity was, apparently, ever open, obvious, or ostentatious enough to provide Roosevelt with a single example he could im part to a curious reader. In actuality, although the Tudeh P arty m ore or less faithfully followed the fluctuating Moscow line on Ira n, the relation of the party to Mossadegh was m uch mote com plex than Roosevelt and o ther cold-war chroniclers have m ade it out to be. The Tudeh felt very am biguous about the wealt hy, eccentric, land-owning prim e m inister who, nonetheless, was standing up to im perial ism. Dean Acheson, Trum an' s Secretary of State, described Mossadegh as \"essen tially a rich, reactionary, feudal-m inded Persian\", 7 hardly your typical Communi st Party fellow-traveler. On occasion the Tudeh had supported Mo ssadegh' s policies; m ore often it had attacked th em bitterly, and in one inst ance, o n 15 July 1951, a Tudeh-sponsored dem onstration was brutally suppressed by Mo ssadegh, resulting in som e 100 deaths and 500 injured. The Iranian leader, moreover, had cam paigned successfully against lingering Soviet occupation of northern Iran after W orld War II, and in October 1947 had led Parliam ent in its reje ction of a governm ent proposal th at a joint Irano-Soviet oil com pany be set up to exploit the oil of northern Iran. 8 What, indeed, did Mossadegh have to gain by relinquishing a ny of his power to the Tudeh and/or the Soviet Union? The idea tha t the Russ ians even des ired the Tud eh to take power is no m ore than speculation. There was just as much evidence, or as little, to conclude that the Russians, once again, we re more concerned a bout their relationship with W estern governm ents than with the fate of a local Communist Party in a country outside the s ocialist b loc of Eastern E urope. A secret State Departm ent intelligen ce report, dated 9 January 1953, in the closing days of the Trum an adm inistrati on, stated that Mossadegh had not sought any alliance with the Tudeh, and that \"The m ajor opposition to the National Front 65"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"[Mossadegh's governing coalition] arises from the vested in terests, on th e one hand, and the Tudeh P arty on the other.\" 9 The Tudeh Party had been declared illeg al in 1949 and Mossadegh had not lifted that ban although he allowed the party to operate openly, at le ast to som e extent because of his democratic convictions, and had appointed some Tudeh sym pathizers to governm ent posts. Many of the Tudeh' s objectives parallel ed those espoused by the National Front, the State Departm ent report observed, but \"An open Tudeh m ove for power ... would probably unite independents and non-Comm uni sts of all po litical leanings and would result ... in energetic efforts to destroy Tudeh by force.\" 10 The Nationa l Front itself was a coalition of highly diverse political and religious elem ents including right-wing anti-communi sts, held together by respect for Mossadegh' s personal character and honest y, and by nationalistic sentiments, particularly in regard to the nationalization of oil. In 1979, when he was asked about this State Departm ent report, Ker mit Roosevelt replied: \"I don' t know what to m ake of that ... Loy Henderson [US am bassador to Iran in 1953] thought that th ere w as a serious danger that Mossadegh was going to, in effect, place Iran under Soviet dom ination.\" 11 Though he was the principal moving force behind the coup, Roosevelt was now passing the buck, and to a m an who, as we shall see in the Middle East chapter, was given to alarm ist statem ents about \"communist takeovers\". One can but wonder w hat Roosevelt, or anyone else, m ade of a statem ent by John Foster Dulles before a Senate comm ittee in July 1953, when the op eration to oust Mossadegh was already in process. The Secret ary of State, the press reported, testified \"that there was ' no substantial evidence' to ind icate th at Iran was coo perating with Russia. On the whole, he added, Moslem opposition to communism is predom inant, although at tim es the Iranian Governm ent appears to rely for support on the Tudeh party, which is comm uni stic.\" l2 The young Shah of Iran had been relegated to little m ore than a passive role by Mossadegh and the Iran ian politica l process. His power had been whittled away to the point where he was \"incapable of indepe ndent action\", noted the State Departm ent inte llig ence report. Mos sadegh was pressing f or contro l of the arm ed f orces and m ore say over expenditures of the royal court, a nd th e inexperien ced and ind ecis ive Shah— the \"Kin g of Kings\"—w as reluctant to open ly oppose th e prim e m inister because of the latter' s popularity- The actual s equence of events instig ated by Roo sevelt which culm inated in the Shah' s ascendancy appears rather sim ple in hindsight, even naive, and owed not a little to luck. The first step was to reas sure the Sh ah that Eisenhower and Churchill were behind him in his stru ggle f or power with Mossadegh an d were willing to provide whatever military and political support he needed. Roosevelt did not actually know what Eisenhower felt, or even knew, about th e operation and went so far as to fabricate a m essage from the president to the S hah express ing his encou ragem ent. 13 At the same time, the Shah was persua ded t o issue r oyal decrees d ismissing Mossadegh as prim e minister and replacing him with one Fazlollah Z ahedi, a general who had been im prisoned during the war by the British f or collabo ration with the Nazis. 14 Late in the night of 14/15 August, th e Shah' s em issary delivered the royal decree to Mossadegh' s hom e, which was guarded by troops. Not surprisingly, he was received very coolly and did not get in to see th e prim e m inister. Instead, he was obliged to leave the decree with a se rvant who signed a receip t for th e pie ce of p aper d ism issing his m aster from power. Equally unsurpris ing, Mossadegh did not abdicate. The prime 66"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"minister, who m aintained that only Parliam ent could dismiss him , delivered a radio broadcast the following m orning in which he stated that the Shah, encouraged by \"foreign elem ents\", had attem pted a coup d'etat . Mossadegh then declared that h e was, therefore, compelled to cake full power unto him self. He denounced Zahedi as a traitor and sought to have him arrested, but the ge neral had been hidden by Roosevelt' s team . The Shah, fe aring all was lost, fled with his queen to Rom e via Baghdad without so m uch as packing a suitcase. Un deterre d, R oosevelt went ahead and directed the mimeographing of copies of the royal decrees for distribution to th e public, and sent two of his I rania n agents to important m ilitary co mmanders to s eek the ir sup port. It appe ars that th is cru cial m atter was lef t to the last minute, alm ost as an afterthought. Indeed, one of the two Iranians had been recruited for the cause only the sam e day, and it was only he who succeeded in winning a comm itment of military sup port from an Iranian colo nel who had tanks and arm ored cars under his command. 15 Beginning on 16 August, a m ass demonstr ation arranged by the National Front, supporting Mossadegh and attacking the Shah a nd the United States, took place in the capital city, Teheran. Ro osevelt characterizes the dem onstrators sim ply as \"the Tudeh, with strong Russian encouragem ent\", once ag ain failing to offer any evidence to su pport his assertion . The New Y ork Times referred to them as \"Tude h partisans and Nationalist extrem ists\", the latte r term being one wh ich could have applied to individuals com prising a wide range of politic al leaning s. 16 Am ong the dem onstrators there were as we ll a num ber of i ndividuals working for the CIA. According to Richard Cottam , an Am erican academ ic and author reportedly in the em ploy of the Agency in Teheran at th is tim e, these agents were s ent \"into the s treets to act as if they were T udeh. They were more than just provocateurs, they were shock troops, who acted as if they were Tudeh people throwing rocks at mosques and priests\", the purpose of which wa s to stam p the Tudeh and, by im plication, Mossadegh as being anti-religion. 17 During the dem onstrations, the Tudeh ra ised their f amiliar dem and f or the creation of a dem ocratic republic. They app ealed to Mossadegh to form a united front and to provide them with arm s to defend against th e cou p, but the prim e m inister refused. 18 Instead, on 18 August he ordered the po lice and arm y to put an end to the Tudeh de monstrations which they did with considerable force. According to the accounts of Roosevelt and Am bassador Henders on, Mossadegh took this step as a result of a meetin g with Henderson in which th e ambassador com plained of the extrem e harassm ent being suffered by US citizens at the hands of the Iranians. It is left unclear by both of the Am ericans how much of th is harassm ent was real and how muc h manufactured by the m for the occasion. In any event, Henderson told Mossadegh that unless it ceased, he would be obliged to order all Am erican s to leav e Iran at on ce. Mossadegh, says Henderson, begged him not to do this for an Am erican evacuation would m ake it appear that his governm ent was unable to control the country, although at the sam e tim e the prime m inister w as accus ing the CIA of being beh ind the issuan ce of the royal decrees. 19 (The Tudeh newspaper at this tim e was dem anding the expulsion of \"interventionist\" Am erican diplom ats.) 20 Whatever Mossadegh' s motivation, his action was again in sharp contradiction to the idea tha t he was in allianc e with the Tude h or that the party was in a position to grab the reins of power. Indeed, the Tudeh did not take to the streets again. The following day, 19 August, Roosevelt' s Iranian agents staged a parade through Teh eran. W ith a fund of som e one m illion dollars having been estab lished in a saf e in the Am erican e mbassy, the \"extrem ely com petent professional ' organizers' ,\" as Roosevelt called them , had no difficulty in buying them selves a m ob, probably using 67"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"but a sm all fraction of the fund. (The various accounts of the CIA role in Iran have the Agency spending from $10,000 to $19 m illion to overthro w Mossadegh. The larger am ounts are based on reports that the CIA e ngaged in heavy bribery of m embers of Parliam ent and other influential Iranians to enlist their support against the prim e minister.) Soon a line of people could be seen com ing out of the an cient b azaar, led by circus and athletic perform ers to attract the public. The m archers were waving banners, shouting \"L ong live the Shah!\" Along the edges of the procession, m en were passing out Iranian currency adorned w ith a portra it of the Shah. The dem ons trators gathered followers as they went, people joining and picking up the chants, undoubtedly for a myriad of political and personal reasons. The balance of psychology had swung against Mossadegh. Along the way, som e m atchers broke ra nks to attack the offices of pro- Mossadegh newspapers and political parries , Tudeh and governm ent offices. Presently, a voice broke in over the radio in T eheran anno uncing that \"The Shah' s instruction that Mossadegh be dism issed has been carried out. The new Prim e Minister, Fazlollah Zahedi, is now in office. And His Im perial Majesty is on his way hom e!\" This was a lie, or a \"pre -tru th\" as R oos evelt suggested. Only then did he go to fetch Zahedi from his hiding place. On the way, he happened to run into the comm ander of the air force who was am ong the m arching throng. Roosevelt told the officer to ge t hold of a tank in which to carry Zahedi to Mossadegh' s house in proper fashion. 21 Kerm it Roosevelt would have the r eader be liev e that a t this point it was all over but the shouting and the cham pagne he was soon to uncork: Mossadegh had fled, Zahedi had assum ed power, the Shah had been notified to return—a dram atic, joyful, and peaceful trium ph of popular will. Inexplicab ly, he neglects to m ention at all that in the streets of Teheran and in front of Mo ssadegh' s house t hat day, a nine-hour battle raged, with soldiers loyal to Mossadegh on one side and those supporting Zahedi and the Shah on the other. Som e 300 people were reported killed and hundreds more wounded before Mossadegh' s defenders finally succum bed. 22 Roosevelt also fails to m ention any c ontribution of the B ritish to the whole operation, which considerably irritated th e m en in MI6, the CIA' s counterpart, w ho claim that th ey, as well as AIOC staff, local businessm en and other Iranians, had indeed played a role in the events. But they have been tight-lipped about what that role was precis ely. 23 The US Mi litary Mission in Iran also claim ed a role in the action, as Major General George C. Stewart late r testified before Congress: Now, when t his crisis cam e on and the th ing was abou t to co llap se, we violated our norm al cri teria an d am ong the ot her things we did, we provided the a rmy im mediately on a n em erg ency basi s, blank ets, b oots, un iforms, electr ic gene rat ors, a nd m edical sup plies t hat pe rmitted an d cre ated t he at mosph ere i n whi ch t hey could s upport the Sha h ...

By his own adm ission, he was in clo se contact with the Agency in Teheran a nd even aided them in their operation. 25 Earlier in the year, the New York Times had noted that \"prevailing opinion am ong detached observers in Teheran\" was that \"Mossadegh is the most popular politician in the country\". During a period of m ore than 40 years in public life, Mossadegh had \"acquired a reputa tion as an honest patriot\". 26 In July, the State Dep artm ent Director of Iranian Affairs had testified that \"Mossadegh has such trem endous control ove r the m asses of people that it would be very difficult to throw him out.\" 27 A few days later, \"at least 100,000\" peopl e filled the street s of Teheran to express strong anti-US and an ti-Shah sentim ents. Though sponsored by the Tudeh, the turnout far exceeded any estim ate of party adh erents. 28 But popularity and m asses, of the unarm ed kind, counted for little, f or in the final ana lysis what Teh eran witnes sed wa s a m ilitary sho wdown carr ied ou t on both sides by soldiers obediently following the orders of a handful of offi cer s, som e of whom were staking their careers and am bitions on c hoosing the winning side: som e had a more ideolog ical comm itment. The New York Times characterized the sudd en reversal of Mossadegh' s fortunes as \"nothing m ote than a m utiny ... agai nst pro-Mossadegh officers\" by \"the lower ranks\" who reve red the Shah, had brutally quelled the dem onstrations the day before, but refuse d to do the sam e on 19 August, and instead turned ag ain st their officers. 29 What connection Roosevelt and his agents had with any of the pro-Shah officers beforehand is not clear. In an interview given at about the sam e tim e that he finished his book, Roosevelt stated that a num ber of pro-Sh ah officers were given refuge in the CIA com pound adjoining the US Embassy at the tim e the Shah fled to Rom e. 30 But inasm uch as Roosevelt m entions not a word of this ra the r im portant a nd inter esting developm ent in his book, it m ust be regarded as yet another of hi s assertions to be approached with caution . In any event, it m ay be that the 19 August dem onstration organized by Roosevelt' s team was ju st th e en cou tagem ent an d spark the se of ficers w ere wa iting for. Yet, if so, it f urther illus trates how much Roosevelt had left to chance. In light of all the questionable, cont radictory, and devious statem ents which em anated at tim es from John Foster Dulles, Kerm it Roosevelt, Loy Henderson and other Am erican officials, what conclusions can be drawn about Am erican m otivation in the toppling of Mossadegh? The consequences of the coup m ay offer the best guide. For the next 25 years, the Shah of Iran stood fast as the United States' closest ally in the Third W orld, to a degr ee that would have shocked the independent and neutral Mos sadegh. The Shah literally placed hi s country at the disposal of US m ilitary and intelligence organizations to be used as a cold-war weapon, a window and a door to the Soviet Union—electronic listening and ra dar posts were set up near the Soviet border; American aircraft used Iran as a base to launch survei llance flights over the Soviet Union; espionage agents were inf iltrated across the border; various Am erican military installa tions dotted the Iran ian lands cap e. Ir an was viewed as a vita l link in the chain being forged by the United States to \"contain \" the Soviet Union. In a telegram to the British Acting Fore ign Secr etar y in September, Dulles said: \" I thin k if we can in 69"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"coordination m ove quickly and effectively in Iran we would close the most dangerous gap in the line from Europe to South Asia.\" 31 In February 1955, Iran becam e a m embe r of the Baghdad Pact, set up by the United States, in Dulles' s words, \"to create a solid band of resistance agains t the Soviet Union\". 32 One year af ter the coup, th e Iranian governm ent com pleted a contract with an international consortium of oil companies. Amongst Iran' s new foreign partners, the British lost the exclus ive rights th ey had en joyed previously, being reduc ed now to 40 percent. Another 40 percent now went to Am eric an oil f irm s, the re mainder to other countries. T he British, however, received an extrem ely generous com pensation for their for mer property. 33 In 1958, Kerm it Roosevelt left the CIA and presently went to work for Gulf Oil Co., one of the Am erican oil firm s in the consortium . In this position, Roosevelt was director of Gulfs relations with the US governm ent and foreign governm ents, and ha d occasion to deal with the Shah. In 1960, Gulf appointed him a vice president. Subsequently, Roosevelt form ed a consul ting firm , Downs and Roosevelt, which, between 1967 and 1970, reportedly received $116,000 a year above expenses for its efforts on behalf of the Iranian governm ent. Another client, the No rthrop Corporation, a Los Angeles-based aerospace com pany, paid Roosevelt $75,000 a year to aid in its sales to Ir an, Sau di Arabia and other countries. 34 (See the Midd le East chap ter for Roosevelt' s CIA connection with King Saud of Sa udi Arabia.) Another American m ember of the new c onsortium was Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey (now Exxon), a clien t of Su lliv an and Crom well, the New York law firm of which John Foster Dulles had long been the senior m ember. Brother Allen, Director of the CIA, had also been a m ember of the fir m. 35 Syndicated colum nist Jack Anderson reported so me years later that the R ockefelle r fam ily, who controll ed S tandard Oil and Chase Manhattan Bank, had \"helped arrange the CIA coup that brought down Mossadegh\". Anderson listed a number of ways in which the Shah d emonstrated his gratitude to the Rockef ellers, including heavy de posits of his personal fortune in Chase Manhattan, and housing developm ents in Iran built by a Rockefeller fam ily com pany. 36 The standard \"textbook \" account o f what took place in Iran in 1953 is that— whatever else one m ight say for or a gains t the operation—the United States saved Iran from a Soviet/Comm uni st takeover. Yet, dur ing the two years of Am erican and British subversion of a bordering country, the Sovi et Union did nothing that would support such a prem ise. When the British Navy staged the larges t concentration of its forces since W orld W ar II in Iranian waters, the S oviets took no belligerent steps; nor when Great Britain instituted draconian internati onal sanctions which left Iran in a deep econom ic crisis and extrem ely vulnerable, did the oil fields \"fall hostage\" to the Bolshevik Menace; this, despite \"the whole of the Tudeh P arty at its disposal\" as agents, as Roosevelt put it. 37 Not even in the face of the coup, with its im print of foreign hand s, did Moscow m ake a threatening move; neith er did Mossadegh at any point ask for Russian help. One year later, however, the New York Times could editorialize that \"Moscow ... counted its chickens bef ore they were hatched and thought that Iran would be the next 'People' s Dem ocracy.\" At th e sam e ti me, the newspaper warned, with surprising arrogan ce, that \"und erd evel oped countries with rich resources now have an object lesson in the heavy cost that m ust be paid by one of their num ber which goes berserk with fanatical nationalism.\" 38 A decade later, Allen Dulles solemnly stared that comm unism had \"achieved control of the governmental apparatus\" in Iran. 39 And a decade after that, Fortune magazine, to cite one of m any examples, ke pt the story alive by writing that Mossad egh 70"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"\"plotted with the Communist party of Ira n, the Tudeh, to overthrow S hah Mohamm ed Reza Pahlev i and hook u p with the S oviet Union. \" 40 And what of the Iranian people? What did being \"saved from communi sm \" do for them ? For the preponderance of the popul ation, life under the Shah was a grim tableau of grinding poverty, pol ice terror, and torture. Thou sands were executed in the nam e of fighting communism . Diss ent was crushed from the outset of the new regime with Am erican assistance. Kennett L ove wrote that he believed that CIA officer George Carroll, whom he kne w personally, worked with General Farhat Dadsetan, the new military gov ernor of Te heran, \"on prepar ation s for the ver y ef ficient s mothering o f a potentially dangerous d issiden t m ovem ent em anating from the bazaar area and the Tudeh in the first two weeks of November, 1953\". 41 The notorious Iranian secret police, SAVAK, created und er the guid ance of the CIA and Israel, 42 spread its tentacles all over the world to punish Iranian dissidents. According to a form er CIA analyst on Iran, SAVAK was instru cted in torture techniqu es b y the Agency. 43 Am nesty International summ ed up the situation in 1976 by noting that Iran had the \"highest rate of d eath penalties in th e wo rld, no valid system of civilian courts and a history of torture whic h is beyond belief. No country in the world has a worse record in hum an rights than Iran.\" 44 When to th is is added a level of cor ruption that \" star tled even the m ost hardened observers of Middle Eastern thievery\", 45 it is understandable that the Shah needed his huge m ilitary and police force, m aintained by unusually large US aid and training program s, 46 to keep the lid down for as long as he did. Said Senator Hubert Hum phr ey, apparen tly with som e surpris e: Do y ou know what the head of t he I ranian Arm y told one of o ur peopl e? He sai d the Arm y was in goo d sh ape, th ank s to U.S. aid — it was no w cap able of coping with th e ci vilian popu latio n. Th at Arm y isn't g oing to fig ht th e R ussi ans. It's planning to fight the Ira nian peopl e. 47 Where force m ight fail, the CIA turned to its most trusted weapon—money. To insure support for the Shah, or at least th e absence of dissent, the Agency began m aking paym ents to Iran ian religious leaders, alwa ys a capricious bunch. The paym ents to the ayatollahs and m ullahs began in 1953 a nd continued regularly until 1977 when Presiden t Carte r abruptly halted the m. One \"inform ed intelligence sour ce\" estim ated that the am ount paid reached as m uch as $400 million a year; others thought that figure too high, which it certainly seem s to be. The cut-off of funds to the holy m en, it is believed, was one of the elem ents which pr ecipitated the beginning of the end for the King of Kings. 48 10.

Dwight Eisenhower, John Foster Dulles and Allen Dulles had decided that the legally-elected governm ent of Jacobo Arbenz was \"communist\", therefore m ust go; and go it did, in June 1954.

Before the revolution of 1944, whi ch overthrew the Ubic o dictatorship, \"far m laborers had been roped together by the Army for delivery to the low-land farms where they were kept in debt slavery by the landowners.\" 11 The expropriation of large tracts of unc ultivated acreage which was distributed to approximately 100,000 landless peasants, the im prove ment in union rights for the workers, and other social reform s, were the reasons Arbenz ha d won the support of Communists and other le ftists, whic h was no more th an to be expected. W hen Arbe nz was criticized for accepting Comm unist suppo rt, he challenged his crit ics to prove their good faith by backing his reform s them selves . They failed to do so, thus revealing where the ba sis of their c riticism lay. 12 The party form ed by the Communi sts, the Guatem alan Labor Party, held four seats in Congress, the s mallest com pone nt of Arbenz' s ruling coalition which commanded a total of 51 seats in the 1953-54 legislature. 13 Communists held several im portant sub-cabin et posts but none was ever appointed to the cabinet. In ad dition, there were Communists em ployed in the bureaucracy, par ticular ly in th e adm inistra tion of land reform. 14 Lacking anything of substance they c ould accuse the Guatem alan left of, Washington officials were reduced to c ondem nation by sem antics. Thus, communists, unlike normal hum an beings, did not take jobs in the gov ern ment—they \"inf iltra ted\" the governm ent. Communists did not support a part icular program — they \"exploited\" it. Communists did not back Arbenz—they \"used\" him . Moreover, communist s \"controlled\" the labor move ment and land reform —but what type of person is it who devotes himself in an under-d eveloped country to furtheri ng the welfare of workers and peasants ? None other th an the typ e that W ashington calls \"communist\". The basic idea behind the em ploym ent of such language—which was standard Western fare throughout the cold war—was to deny the idea that communists could be people sincerely concern ed about social chan ge.

Both adm inistrations were pressured by executives of United Fruit Company, much of whose vast and uncultivated land in G uatem ala had been expropriated by the Arbenz governm ent as part of the land re form program . The com pany wanted nearly $16 m illion for the lan d, the gov ernm ent was offering $525,000, United Fru it's o wn declared valuation for tax purposes. 17 United Fru it functioned in Guatemala as a state with in a state. It ow ned the country' s telephone and telegraph facilities, adm inistered its only im portant Atlantic harbor, and monopolized its bana na exports. A subsidiary of the com pany owned nearl y every m ile of railroad track in the count ry. T he fruit company' s influence am ongst Washington' s power elite was equally i mpressi ve. On a busi ness and/or personal level, it had close ties to the Dulles brothers, various State Department officials, congressm en, the Am erican Am bassador to the United Nations, and others. Anne Whitm an, the wife of the company' s public relations direct or, was President Eisenhower' s personal secretary. Under-secretary of State (and for merly Directo r of the CIA) W alter Bedell Sm ith was seeking an executive p osition with United Fru it a t the sa me tim e he was helping to plan the coup. He was later na med to the com pany' s board of directors. 18 Under Arbenz, Guatemala constructed an Atlantic port and a highway to com pete with United Fruit' s holdings, and bui lt a hydro-electric pl ant to offer cheaper energy than the US-controlled electricity m onopoly. Arbenz' s strategy w as to lim it the power of foreign companies through dire ct com petition rather than through nationalization, a policy not feasible of c ourse when it cam e to a fixed quantity like land. In his inaugural addre ss, Arbenz stated that: Fo reign cap ital will always be welco me as long as it adj usts to lo cal con dition s, rem ains always subo rdinate to Gu atem alan laws, coo perat es with th e eco nomic development of th e co un try, and strictly abstain s fro m in tervening in the n ation 's social and po litical life. 19 This hardly describ ed United Fruit' s role in Guatem ala. Amongst m uch else, the com pany ha d persistently endeavored to frustrate Arbenz' s refor m program s, discredit him and his governm ent, and induce his downfall. Arbenz was, according ly, wary of m ultinatio nals and co uld not be said to welcom e them into his country with open arm s. This attitud e, his expropriation of United Fruit' s land, and his \"tolerance of co mmunists\" were more than enough to m ake him a m arked m an in Washington.

In March 1953, the CIA approached di sgruntled right-wing officers in the Guatem alan arm y and arranged to se nd them arms. United Fruit donated $64,000 in cash. The following m onth, uprisings broke out in several towns but were quickly put down by loyal troops. The rebels were put on tr ial and rev ealed the f ruit com pany' s role in the plot, but not the CIA' s. 20 The Eisenhower adm inistration resolved to do the job right the next tim e around. With cynical glee, almost an entire year was spent in painst aking, step-by-step preparation for the overthrow of Jac obo Arbenz Guzm an. Of the m ajor CIA undertakings, few have been as well docum ented as has the coup in Guatem ala. W ith the release of m any form erly classified governm ent papers, the following story ha s em erged. 21 Headquarters for the operation were esta blished in Opa Locka, Florida, on the outskirts of Miam i. The Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza lent/leased his country out as a site for an airstrip and for hundr eds of m en—Guatem alan exiles and US and Central American m ercenaries—to receive training in the use of weapons and radio broadcas ting , as well as in the fine arts of sabotage and dem olition. Thirty airplan es were ass igned for use in the \"Liberation\" , stationed in Nicaragua, Honduras and the Canal Zone, to be flown by American pilo ts. The Can al Zone was set as ide as a weapons depot from which arm s were graduall y distributed to the rebels who were to assem ble in Honduras under the comm and of Colonel C arlos Castillo Arm as be fore crossing into Guatem ala. Soviet-m arked weap ons were also gathered for the purpose of planting them inside Guatem ala before the i nvasion to reinforce US charges of Russian intervention. And, as importan t as arm s, it turn ed out, hidd en radio transm itters were placed in an d around the perim eter o f Guate mala, includ ing o ne in the US Em bassy. An attem pt was m ade to blow up the tr ains carrying the Czech weapo ns from port-s ide to Guatem ala City; however, a to rrential downp our rend ere d the d eton ators useless, wh ereupon the CIA param ilitary squ ad opened fire on one train, k illing a Guatem alan soldier and wounding three others; but the convoy of trains m ade it safe ly to its destination. After the Czech ship had arriv ed in Gu atem ala, Eisenhower ordered the stopping of \"suspicio us foreign-flag vessels on the high s eas off Guat em ala to exam ine cargo\". 22 The State Departm ent's legal adviser wrot e a brief which concl uded in no uncertain term s that \"Such action would constitute a viol ation of intern ationa l law.\" No m atter. At least two foreign vessels were stopped and searched, one French and one Dutch. It w as because of such actions by the British that the United States had fought the W ar of 1812. The Guatemalan m ilitary cam e in for special attention. The US ostentatiously signed m utual security treatie s with Honduras and Nicaragua , both countries hostile to Arbenz, and dispatched large shipments of ar ms to them in the hope that this would signal a clear enough threat to the Guatem alan military to persuade it to withdraw its support of Arbenz. Addition ally, the US Na vy dispatched two submarines from Key West, saying only that they we re going \"south\". Several days later, th e Air Force, a mid considerable fanfare, sent three B-36 bo mbers on a \"courtesy call\" to Nicaragua. The CIA also m ade a close study of the records of m embers of the Guatem alan officer corps and offered bribes to som e of them . One of the Agency 's clandestine radio stations bro adcast app eals aim ed at m ilitary m en, as well as others, to jo in the libe ration move ment. The station reported that Arbenz was secretly p lanning to disband or disarm 75"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"the arm ed forces and rep lace it with a people' s militia. CIA p lanes dropp ed leaflets over Guatem ala carrying the s ame m essage. Eventually, at Am bassador Peurifoy' s ur ging, a group of high -ranking officers called on Arbenz to ask that he dism iss all communists who held posts in his adm inistration. The president assured them tha t the communists did not represent a danger, that they did not run the governm ent, and that it would be undem ocratic to dism iss them. At a second m eeting, the offi cers also dem anded that A rbenz reject the crea tion of the \"people' s m ilitia\". At one point, the CIA offerred Arbenz hi mself a large sum of money, which was rejected. The m oney, which was deposited in a Swiss bank, presum ably was offered to induce Arbenz to abdicate or to serve as a m eans of later claim ing he was corrupt. On the econom ic front, contingency plans were m ade f or such th ings a s cutting off Guatem alan credit abroad, disrupting its o il supplies, and causing a run on its foreign reserv es. 23 But it was on the propaganda front th at Am erican ingenuity shone at its brightest. In asm uch as the Guatem alan govern ment was being overth rown because it was comm unist, the fact of its communism would have to be i mpressed upon the rest of Latin Am erica. Acco rdingly, the US Info rmation Agency (USIA) began to place unattributed artic les in f orei gn newspapers labeling particular Guatem alan officials a s communist and referring to various act ions by the Guatem alan governm ent as \"communist-inspired\". In the few weeks prio r to Arbenz's fall alone, m ore than 200 articles about Guatem ala were written and placed in scores of Latin Am erican newspapers. Em ploying a m ethod which was to becom e a standard CIA/USIA fea ture all over Latin Am erica an d elsewhere, as we sha ll see, articles placed in on e country were picked up by newspapers in other countries, either as a result of CI A paym ent or unwitting ly because the sto ry was of interest. Bes ides the obv ious advantag e of multiply ing the potential audienc e, the tactic gave the ap pearanc e th at independ ent world opinion was taking a certain stand a nd further obscured the Am erican connection. The USIA also distributed m ore t han 100,000 copies of a pa mphlet entitled \"Chronology of Communism in Guatem ala\" throughout the hem isphere, as well as 27,000 copies of anti-comm unist cartoons and posters. The Am erican propaganda agency, m oreover, produced three film s on Gu atem ala, with predictable content, and newsreels f avorable to th e United St ates for showing free in cinem as. Francis Cardinal Spellm an of Ne w York, a prelate possessed of anti- communis m, a m an who feared social change more than he feared God, was visited by the CIA. Would his Reverence arrange CIA contact with Archbishop Mariano Rossell Arellano of Guatem ala? The Cardinal would be delighted. Thus it cam e to pass that on 9 April 1954, a pastoral letter was read in Guat em alan Catholic churches calling to the attention of the congreg ations the presence in the country of a devil called communi sm and dem anding that the people \"ris e as a sing le m an agai nst th is en emy of God and country\", or at least not rally in Arbenz' s defense. To appreciate the value of this, one must rem ember that Gu atem ala' s peasant cl ass was not only highly religious, but that very few of them were able to read, and so could receive th e Lord 's W ord only in this manner. For those who could read, m any thousands of pa mphlets carrying the Archbishop' s m essage were air-dropped around the country. In May, the CIA covertly sponsored a \"C ongress Against Soviet Intervention in Latin Am erica\" in M exico City. Th e sam e m onth, Som oza ca lled in the d iplom atic corps in Nicaragua and told them , his voice shaking with anger, that his police had discovered a secret Soviet shipm ent of ar ms (which had been planted by the CIA) near the Pacific Coast, and suggested that the comm unists wanted to convert Nicaragua into 76"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"\"a new Korean situ atio n\". A f ew weeks la ter, an unm arked plane parachuted arm s with Soviet m arkings onto G uatem ala' s coast. On such fare did the people of Latin Am erica dine for decades. By such tactics were they educated about \"communism \". In late January 1954 the operation appeared to have suffered a serious setback when photostat copies of Liberation docum ents found their way into Arbenz' s hands. A few days later, Guatem ala' s newspapers publ ished copies of correspondence signed by Castillo Annas, Som oza and others under ba nner headlin es. T he docum ents revealed the existence of som e of the st aging, training and invasion pl ans, involving, amongst others, the \"Governm ent of the North\". 24 The State Departm ent labeled the accusa tions of a US role \"rid iculous and untrue\" and said it would not comment furthe r because it d id not wish to give them a dignity they did not deserve. Said a Depart ment spokesperson: \"It is the policy of the United States not to in terf ere in th e in tern al af fairs of other na tions. This policy has repeatedly been reaffirmed unde r the present administration.\" Time m agazine gave no credence whatsoever to the possibility of Am erican involvem ent in such a plot, concluding that the whole expose had been \"m asterm inded in Moscow\". 25 The New Yo rk Times was not so openly cynical, but its story gave no indication that the re might be any truth to th e m atter. \"Latin Am erican observers in New York,\" reported the newspaper, \"said the ' plot' char ges savored of comm uni st in fluence.\" Th is article was followed imm ediately on the page by one headed \"Red Labor Chiefs Meet. Guatem alan Confederation Opens Its Congress\". 26 And the CIA continued with its p reparations as if nothing had happened. The offensive began in ear nest on 18 June with pl anes dropping leaflets over Guatem ala dem anding that Arbenz resign imm ediately or else vari ous sites would be bom bed. CIA radio stations broadcast sim ilar m essages. That afternoon, the planes return ed to m achine-gun houses near m ilitary b arracks, dro p fragm entation bom bs and straf e th e Nationa l Palac e. Over the following week, the air attack s continued daily—st rafing or bom bing ports, f uel tanks, amm unition dum ps, m ilitary barra cks, th e Interna tio nal a irpo rt, a school, and several cities; nine persons, incl uding a three-year-old girl, were reported wounded; an unknown num ber of houses were set afire by incendiary explosives. During one night-tim e raid, a tape record ing of a bomb attack was played over loudspeakers set up on the roof of the US Embassy to heighten the anxiety of the capital' s residents. W hen Arbenz went on th e air to try and calm the public' s fear, the CIA radio team jammed the broadcast. Meanwhile, the Agency' s arm y had cro ssed into Guatem ala from Honduras and captur ed a f ew towns, b ut its prog ress in the face of resistan ce by th e G uatem alan ar my was unspectacular. On the broadcasts of the CIA' s \"Voice of Liberation\" the picture w as different: T he rebels w ere everywhere and ad vancing; they were of large num bers and picking up volunteers as they m arched; wa r and upheaval in all corn ers; fearso me battles and m ajor defeats for the Guatem alan arm y. Some of these broadcas ts were transm itted over regu lar public and even m ilitary channels, serving to convince some of Arbenz' s officers that the reports were genui ne. In the sam e way, the CIA was able to answer real m ilitary m essages with fake responses. All m anner of disinfor mation was spread and rum ors fom ented; dummy parachute drops were m ade in sca ttered a reas to heighten the belief that a m ajor invas ion was tak ing place. 27 77"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"United Fruit Com pany' s publicity office circ ulated photographs to journalists of mutilated b odies abou t to be bur ied in a m ass grave as a n exam ple of the atroc ities comm itted by the Arbenz regim e.

Th om as McCann of the com pany' s publicity office later revealed th at he had no idea what the photos represented; \"They could just as easily have been th e victim s of e ither side—or of an earthquake. The point is, they were widely accepted for what they were purported to be—victim s of communism . In a sim ilar vein, W ashington of ficial s reported on political arrests and censorship in Guatem ala without reference to the fact that the governm ent was under siege (let alone who was behi nd the siege), that suspected plotters and saboteurs were the bulk of those being arrest ed, or that, overall, the Arbe nz adm inistration had a fine record on civil lib erties. The perf ormance of th e Am erican pr ess in this re gard was little bette r. The prim ary purpose of the bom bing and the m any for ms of disinform ation was to m ake it appear th at military d efenses were cru mbling, that resis tance was futile, thus provoking confusion and division in the Guat em alan arm ed forces and causing som e elem ents to turn against Arbenz. The ps ychological warfare conducted over the radio was directed by E. Howard Hunt, later of Water gate f ame, and David Atlee Phillips, a newcom er to the CIA. When Phillips was first approached about the assignm ent, he asked his superior, T racy Barnes, in all innoc ence, \"But Arbenz became President in a free election. W hat right do we have to he lp someone topple his government and throw him out of office? \" \"For a m oment,\" wrote Phillips later, \"I detected in his face a flicker of concern, a doubt, the reactions of a sensitive m an.\" Bu t Barnes quickly recovered and repeated the party line about th e Soviets establis hing \"an easily expandable beachhead \" i n Central Americ a. 28 Phillips never looked back. W hen he reti red from the CIA in the m id-1970s, he founded the Association of Re tired Intelligence Officers, an organization form ed to counteract the flood of unfavor able publicity sw eeping over the Agency at the tim e. Am erican jo urnalists rep orting on th e even ts in Guatem ala continued to exhibit neithe r an investig ativ e inclina tion nor a health y conspirac y m entality. But what was obscure to the US press was patently obvious to large num bers of Latin Am ericans . Heated protests against the United States brok e out during this week in June in at least eleven countries and was echoed by the gove rnm ents of Ec uador, Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile w hich condemned Am erican \"intervention\" and \"aggression\". Life m agazine noted th ese pro tests by observing that \"world comm unism was efficiently u sing the Guatem alan show to strike a blow at the U.S.\" It scoffed at the id ea that W ashington was behind the revolt. 29 Newsweek reported that W ashington \"officials inte rpre ted\" the ou tcry \"as an ind ication of the depth of Red penetration into the Am ericas\". 30 A State D epartm ent mem o at the tim e, however, priv ately acknowledged that m uch of the protest em anate d from non-comm unist and even pro-Am erican moderates. 31 On 21 and 22 June, Guatem alan Foreign Min ister Toriello m ade impassioned appeals to the United Nations for help in re solving the cr isis.

Agency planes were dis patched to d rop se veral harm less bombs on Honduran te rrito ry. The Honduran governm ent then com plained to the UN and the Organization of Am erican States, claim ing that the co untry had been attacked by Guatem alan plan es. 34 Arbenz finally received an ul tim atum from certain arm y officers : Res ign or they would com e to an agreem ent with the i nvaders. The CIA and Am bassador Peurifoy ha d been offerin g paym ents to officers to defect, and one army comma nder reportedly accepted $60,000 to surrender his troops. W ith his back to the wall, Arbenz m ade an attem pt to arm civilian s upporters to fight for the governm ent, but array officers blo cked the disbursem ent of weapons. The Guatem alan president knew that the end was near. The Voice o f Liberation m eanwhile was pr oclaim ing that two large and heavily arm ed columns of invaders were m oving to wards Guatem ala City. As the hours passed, the further advance of the m ythical forces was announced, while Castillo Ar mas and his sm all band had actually not progressed ve ry far from the Honduran border. The Am erican disinform ation and rum or offensiv e continued in other ways as well, and Arbenz, with no one he could trust to give him accurate inform ation, could no longer be certain th at there wasn' t at le ast som e tru th to th e radio bu lletins. Nothing would be allowed to th reaten the v ictory so near at hand: A British freighter docked in Guatem ala and suspected of having arrived with fuel for Arbenz' s military veh icles, was b ombed and s unk by a CIA plane after the crew h ad been warned to f lee. It tu rned out tha t the ship ha d co me to Guatem ala to pick up a cargo of coffee and cotton. A desperate Toriello p leaded repeatedly with Am bassador Pe urifoy to call off the bom bings, offering even to reopen nego tiations about United Fruit' s com pensation. In a long cable to John Foster Dulles, the fore ign m inister described the aerial attacks on the civilian population, expressed his country 's defenselessness against the bom bings, and appealed to the United States to use its good offices to put an end to them . In what must have been a deeply hum iliatin g task, Tori ello stated all of this without a hint that the United States was, or coul d be, a party to any of it. The pleas were not sim ply too late. They had always been too late. The Castillo Arm as forc es could not have defea ted the m uch larg er Guatem alan array, but the air a ttac ks, com bined with th e belief in the invincib ility of the enemy, persuaded Guatem alan m ilitary officers to force Arbenz to resign.

He then sent a sim ple cable to CIA headquarters in Fl orida: \"We have been doubled-crossed.

Castillo Arm as, whose anti-comm unism the United States could trus t, was soon the new leader of Guate mala. The propaganda show was not yet over. At the behest of th e CIA, Guatem alan military officers of th e new regim e took fore ign correspon dents on a tour of Arbenz' s for mer residence where they could see for them selves room s filled with school textbooks published in ... ye s, the Soviet Union. The New York Times correspondent, Paul Kennedy, considered to be strongly an ti-Arbenz, concluded that the \"books had been planted\" and did not bother to report the story. 37 Time made no m ention of the books either, but som ehow cam e upon the stor y that m obs had plundered Arbenz's hom e and found \"stacks of co mmunist propaganda and four bags of earth, one each from Russia, China, Siberia and Mongolia. \" 38 Time 's article m ade it clear enough that it now knew of the Am erican ro le in Arbenz' s downfall (a lthough certainly not the ful l story), but the m agazine had nothing to sa y about the propriety of overthrowing a dem ocratically elected governm ent by force. Castillo Arm as celebrated the liberation of Guatem ala in various ways. In July alone, thousands were arrested on suspicion of communist activity. Many were tortured or killed. In August a law was passed and a comm ittee set up which could declare anyone a communist, with no right of appeal . Those so declared could be arbitrarily arrested for up to six m onths, could not own a radio or hold public office. W ithin four months the comm ittee had registered 72,000 na mes. A comm ittee official said it was aim ing for 200,000.39 Further im plem entation of the agrarian reform law was stopped and all expropriations of land already carried out were declared invalid. 40 United Fruit Com pany not only received all its land b ack, but the governm ent banned the banana workers' unions as well. Moreover, seven em ployees of the com pany who had been active labor organizers were found myster iously m urdered in Guatem ala City. 41 The new regim e also disenfranchised th ree-qu arters of Guatem ala' s voters by barring illiterates f rom the elec tor al ro lls and outlawed all po litic al parties, la bor confederations and peasant organizations.

In cables he exchanged with Am bassador Peurifoy, Dulles insisted that the governm ent arrest those Guatem alans who had taken refuge in foreign em bassies and that \"cri minal charges\" be brought against them to prevent them leaving the country, charges such as \"having been covert Moscow agents\". The Secretary of State argued that communists should be auto matically d enied the rig ht of asylum because they were connected with an international c onspiracy. The only way they should be allowed to leave, he asserted, wa s if they agreed to be sent to the Soviet Union. But Castillo Arm as refused to accede to Dulles' s wishes on this particular issue , influenced perhaps by the fact that he, as well as som e of his colleagues, had bee n granted political asylum in an em bass y at one time or another. 44 One of those who sought asylum in th e Argentine Em bassy was a 25-year-old Argentine doctor nam ed Ernesto \"C he\" Gu evara. Guevara, who had been living in Guatem ala since som etime in 1953, had tried to spark arm ed resistance to the invading forces, but without any su ccess. Guev ara' s experience in Guatem ala had a profound effect upon his political consciousness.

On 30 June, while the dust was still se ttling, Dulles summ ed up the situation in Guatem ala in a speech which was a m onum ent to coldwarsp eak: [The e vents in Guatem ala] ex pos e the ev il pu rpo se of th e Krem lin to destro y th e inter- Am erican system ... ha ving gaine d cont rol of wha t they call the m ass organizat ions , [t he c ommuni sts] moved o n to take o ver the o fficial press an d radi o of the Guat em alan Gove rnment.

The large influx of questionable characters com plicated the agency' s job of surveillance and forced it to increas e its staff.\" 5 The CIA' s problem s with Figueres actually went som ewhat deeper. Costa Rica was a haven for hundreds of exiles fleeing fr om various Latin Am erican right-wing dictatorsh ips , such as in the Dom inican Republic, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, and Figueres was providing groups of them with m aterial and m oral support in their plans t o overthrow these regim es. 6 To Figueres, th is w as entire ly in keeping with his an ti- tota litarian belief s, dire cted aga inst the lef t as well as the right.

Syria 1956-1957 Purchasing a new government \"Neutrality,\" proclaim ed John Foster Du lles in 1956, \"has incr easingly become an obsolete conception, and, except under ve ry exceptional circum stances, it is an immoral and shortsighted conception.\" 1 The short-sightedness of the neutralist gove rnm ent lay perhaps in its inability to perceive that its neutralism would lead to J ohn F oster Dulles attem pting to overthrow it. Syria was not behaving like W ashingt on thought a Third World governm ent should. For one thing, it was the only state in the area to refuse all US econom ic or military as sistance. Dam ascus did no t m uch care f or the strin gs which ca me attached— the ac ceptan ce of m ilitar y aid us ually m eant th e presenc e of Am erican military advis ers and technicians; furthermore, the US Mutu al S ecurity Act of 1955 specified that the recip ient co untry ag ree to m ake a contribu tion to \"the defensive strength of the free world\", and declared it US policy \"to encou rage the efforts of other free nations ... to foster priv ate initia tive a nd com petition [ i.e., capitalism ].\" 2 Another difficulty posed by Syria was th at, although its governm ents of recent years had been m ore or less conservative and had refrained from unpleasant leftist habits like nationa lizing Am erican-owned companies, US officials — suffering from what m ight be called anti-communist para noia or being victim s of their own propaganda—consistently saw the m ost om inous handwritings on the walls. To appreciate this, one has to re ad some of the form erly-secret-now-declas sified docu ment s of the National Security Counc il (NSC), based in part on reports received from the Am erican embassy in Dam ascus during 1955 and 1956 ... \"If the popular leftward trend in Syria continues over any c onsiderable period, there is a real danger th at Syria will fall com pletely und er lef t-wing co ntrol e ith er by coup or usurpation of a uthority\" ... \"the f undamental anti-U S and anti-West orientation of the Syrians is stimulated by inevitab le politica l his trionics abou t the Palestine problem \" ... \"Four successiv e short- lived g overnm ents in Syria have perm itted continuous and increasing Commu nist activities\" ... \"the Communists support the lef tist cliques [in] the arm y\" ... \"apathy towards Communis m on the part of politicians and arm y officers\" is a threat to security ... \"the Arab Socialist Resurrectionist Party (ASRP)\" and \"the Com munist Party of Syri a are capable of bri nging about further deter iora tion of Syrian inte rnal security\" ... danger of ASRP \" coup d'etat \" and \"increased Communist penetra tion of government and army\" ... \"Of all the Arab states 84"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Syria is at the presen t tim e the m ost wholeh eartedly devoted to a neutralist policy wit h strong anti-Western overtone s\" ... \"If the present trend continues there is a strong possibility that a Communist-dom inated Syri a will re sult, thr eaten ing the peac e and stability of the area and endangering the achie vem ent of out objectives in the Near East\" ... we \"should give priority consideration to developing courses of action in the Neat East des igned to af fect the s itua tio n in Syria and to recomm ending specific s teps to com bat communist subversion\" ... 3 It would appear tha t the idea of m ilitary men who were lef tist and/or apa thetic to communists must truly have b een an incongruous phenom enon to the American official mind. But nowhere in any of the docum ents is there m ention of the leftists/Communists/ASRP having in fact done anything illegal or wicked, although the language employed is sim ilar to what we sa w in the Guatem ala ch apter: These people don' t join anything, they \"infiltrate\", they \"penetrate\"; they \"control\", they' re \"opportunistic\". In actuality, the behavior described is like that of other political anim als: try ing to inf luence key sectors of the socie ty and win allie s. But to the m en holding positions of responsibility in the National Security Council and the State Departm ent, the evil intent an d danger of such people was so self-evident as not to require articulation. There is on e exception, perhaps ex pressed to e xplain away an uncomfortab le observation: In fact , the C ommuni st Part y does not ap pear to ha ve as its immediate o bjective seizu re of power. Rath er it seek s to destro y natio nal unity, Co streng then suppo rt for Soviet policies and oppos ition to Western policies and to exacerbate tensions in the Arab world. It has m ade si gnificant progress coward these objective s. 4 There is no indication of what the au thor had in m ind by \"national unity\". A leftist-oriented or communist-dom inat ed Syrian government, reasoned the US am bassador to Syria, Jam es Moose, Jr., woul d clearly th reaten Am erican interes ts in neighboring Turkey, wh ich, in tu rn, could outfl ank all the states of th e NATO alliance, and so forth and so on. 5 It was clear that since the Syri an governm ent could not be relied upon to do anything about this m ajor im pending disaster, som ething would have to be done about the Syrian governm ent. To this we a dd the usua l Middle -Eas tern intr igue : in th is ca se, Iraq p lottin g with the British to topple the governm ents in both Syria and Nasser' s Egypt; the British pressuring the Am ericans to join the consp iracy; 6 and the CIA com prom ising—leave Nasser alone, at least fo r the tim e being, and we' ll do som ething about Syria. 7 An i mplausible scenario, scandalous, but in the tim e-honored tradition of the Middle East. The British were ol d hands at it. Dulles and th e Am ericans, still exu lting in their king-m aking in Iran, were looking to fu rther rem ake the oil reg ion in their o wn im age. Wilbur Crane Eveland w as a staff mem ber of the National S ecurity Council, the high-level inter-agency group in Washington which, in theory, m onitors and controls CIA clandestine activities. Because of Eveland' s background and experien ce in the Middle East, the CIA had asked th at he be lent to the Agency for a series of assignm ents there. Archibald Roosevelt was, like his cous in Kerm it Roosevelt, a high ly-placed official of the CIA; both were gra ndsons of Teddy. Kerm it had m asterm inded the overthrow of the Iranian governm ent in 1953. Archie had fond hopes of doing the same in Syria. Michail Bey Ilyan had once served as Sy ria' s foreign m inister. In 1956 he was the leader of the conservative Populist Party. 85"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"At a m eeting of these thr ee m en in Da mascus, Syria on 1 July 1956, as describe d by Eveland in his m emoirs, Roosevelt asked Ilyan \"what would be needed to give the Syrian conservatives enough control to purge the communists and their leftist sym pathizers. Ilyan responded by ticking off nam es and places: the radio stations in Da mascus and Aleppo; a few key senior o fficers; and enough m oney to buy newspapers now in Egyptian and Saudi hands.\" \"Roosevelt probed further. Could these thi ngs, he asked Ilyan, be done with U.S. money and assets alone, with no other W ester n or Near Eastern country involved? \" \"W ithout question, Ilyan re plied, nodding gravely.\" On 26 July, Egyptian President G amal Abdul Nasser announced that his governm ent was taking over the operation of th e Suez Canal. The reac tion of the British and French was swift and inflam ed. The Unite d States was less openly hostile, though it was critical and Egyptian governm ent funds in the US were frozen. This unexpected inciden t put a crim p in the CIA' s plans, fo r—as Ilyan explained to Eveland in despair— Nasser was now the hero of the Arab world, and collabora tio n with any Western power to overthrow an Arab governm ent was politically indefensible. Eventually the coup was scheduled for 25 October. The logistics, as outlined by Ilyan, called for senior colone ls in th e Syrian a rmy to: take cont rol of Dam ascus, Al eppo, H oms, and Ham ah. The f rontier p osts wi th Jor dan, Ira q, a nd Leba non w oul d al so be ca ptured i n order to seal Sy ria's b orders until th e rad io statio ns an nou nced that a new gov ern ment h ad tak en over und er Colonel Ka bbani, who woul d place arm ored units at key positions t hroughout Dam ascu s. Once co ntrol h ad b een estab lish ed, Ilyan wou ld inform th e civ ilian s he' d sel ect ed that they were t o fo rm a new g ove rnment, but in orde r to av oid l eaks none of th em wou ld b e to ld until ju st a week before th e cou p. For this operation, m oney would have to change hands. Ilyan asked for and received half a m illion Syrian poun ds (a pproxim ately $167,000). The Syrian further stipulated that to guarantee the ir particip ation the Syr ian plotters would require assurance from the highest level of the Am erican governm ent that the US would both back the coup and immediately grant recogn ition to the new governm ent. This, Ilyan explained, could be communicated as follows: in April, Pres ident Eis enhower had s aid that the United States would oppose aggres sion in the Middle East, hut not without congressional approval. Could th e president repeat this statem ent, in light of the Suez crisis, he asked, on a specified date when Ilyan' s colleagues w ould be told to expect it? Eisenhower' s words would provide the guarantees they were seeking. An affir mative reply to Ilyan' s plan a rrived in D amascus from Washington the next day. A proper occasion for the requested statem ent would have to be found and Secretary D ulles would be the one to use it . The schem e was for Dulles to m ake public reference to Eisenhower' s statem ent between 16 and 18 October, thus giving Ilyan the week he needed to assemble his civilian team . Before long, John Foster Dulles held a pre ss conference. In light of recent Israeli attacks on Jordan, one of the reporters pres ent asked whether the United States m ight com e to Jordan' s aid per \"our declaration of April 9\". Yes, replied the Secretary of State, repe ating the ref erence to th e April statem ent. The date was 16 October. But following close on the heels of this was a m essage from Ilyan in Da mascus to Eveland in Beirut postponing the date of the coup for five days to 30 October because Colonel Kabbani had told Ilyan th at his people weren' t quite ready. The postpo nem ent was crucial. E arly in the m orning of the 30th, a very distraught Michail Ilyan appeared at Eveland' s door. \"L ast night ,\" he cried, \"the Israelis 86"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"invaded Egypt and are right now heading for the Suez Canal! How could you have asked us to overthrow our governm ent at th e exact m oment when Israel started a war with an Arab state?\" 8 The leftist-trend-in-Syria bell continue d to ring in W ashington. In January 1957, wrote Pres ident Eisenh ower late r, CIA Director Alien Dulles \"sub mitted reports indica ting that th e new Syrian Cabinet was or iented to the lef t\". 9 Two m onths later, Dulles prepared a \"Situ ation Report o n Syria\" in which he wrote of an \"increasing trend toward a decidedly leftist, pro-S oviet governm ent\". Dulles was concerned with \"organized lef tist of ficers belong ing to th e Ara b Socialist Resurrec tion Party\" . 10 That sam e m onth, a State Departm ent internal docum ent stated: Th e B ritish are b eliev ed to favo r activ e stimulatio n of a ch ang e in th e presen t regi me in Sy ria, i n an ef fort to assure a p ro-West ern o rientation on t he part of future Syrian go vernments. ... Th e Un ited St ates sh ares th e con cern of th e British Go vernm ent over the situ ation in Syria. 11 Then, in June, an internal Departm ent of De fense m emorandum spoke of a possible \"lef tist coup \". This was to be carri ed ou t, accord ing to the m emo, against \"the lef tist Syria n Governm ent\". 12 Thus it was that in Beirut and Damasc us, CIA officers were trying their hands again at stag e-m anaging a Syrian cou p. On th is o ccasion, Kerm it Roosevelt, rather than cousin Archibald, was pulling the strings. He arranged for one Howard (\"Rocky\"! Stone to be transferred to Dam ascus from the S uda n to be sure that the \"engineering\" was done by a \"pro\". Stone was, at thirty-two, already a legend in the CIA' s clandestine service as the m an who had helped Ki m R oosevelt overthrow the Iranian government four years earlier, though what Stone' s pr ecise contribution was has remained obscure. The proposed beneficiary of this particul ar plot was to be Adib Shishakly, for mer right-wing dictator of Syria, living covertly in Lebanon. Shishakly' s for mer chief of security, Colonel Ib rahim Husseini, now Syrian m ilita ry a ttach e in Rom e, was secretly slipped into Lebanon under cover of a CIA-fabricated passport. Husseini was then to be smuggled across the Syrian borde r in the trunk of a US diplom atic car in order to m eet with key Syrian CIA agents and provide assurances that S hishakly would com e back to rule once Syria' s governm ent had been overthrown. But the coup was exposed before it ever got off the ground. Syrian arm y officers who had been assign ed m ajor roles in the oper ation wa lke d into the o ffice of Syria' s head of inte llig ence, Co lonel Sa rra j, turned in their b ribe money and nam ed the CIA officers who had paid them . Lieut. Col. R obert Molloy, the Am erican arm y attache, Francis J eton, a career CIA officer, officially V ice Consul at the US Embassy, and the legenda ry H oward Ston e, with the title of Seco nd Secretary for Political Affairs, were all declared personae -non gratae and expelled from the country in August. Col. Molloy was determined to leav e Syria in style. As his car appro ached the Lebanese border, he ran his Syrian m otorcyc le escort off the road and shouted to the fallen rider that \"Colonel Sa rraj and his commie friends\" should be told that Molloy would \"beat the shit out of the m with one ha nd tied behind his back if they ever crossed his path again.\" The Syrian governm ent announcem ent which accom panied the expulsion order stated that S tone had first m ade contact wi th the outlawed Social Nation alis t Party a nd then with the arm y officers.

The Am bassador pointed out that Huss eini had not been in Syria since 20 July and his passport showed no indi cation that he had been out of Italy s ince that tim e. The State Departm ent categorized the Syri an charge as \"co mplete fabrication s\" and retaliated by expelling the Syrian am bassador and a Second Secr etary and recalling the Am erican a mbassador from Syri a.

Presiden t Eisenhower, recalling the inciden t in h is m emoirs, offered no d enial to the accusation. His sole comm ent on the ex pulsions was: \"The entire action was shrouded in m ystery but the suspicion wa s strong that the Comm unists had taken control of the governm ent. Moreover, we had fresh reports that arm s were being sent into Syria from the Soviet bloc.\" 16 Syria' s neutralism /\" leftism \" continued to obsess the United States. Five years later, when John F.

This was a piece of paper, like the Trum an Doctrine and the M onroe Doctrine before it, whereby the U S governm ent conferred upon the US governm ent the rem arkable and enviable right to intervene militarily in other coun tries. W ith the str oke of a pen, the Middle Eas t was added to Europe and the W estern hem isphere as Am erica' s field of play. The resolution stated th at \"the United States regards as vital to the national interest and world peace the pres ervation of the indepen dence and integrity of the nations of the Middle East.\" Yet, during this very period, as we have seen, the CIA initiated its operation to overthr ow the government of Syria. 88"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"The business part of the reso lution w as contained in the succinct declaration that the United States \"is prepared to use arm ed forces to as sist\" any Middle East country \"requesting assistance against arm ed a ggression from any country controlled by international comm unis m\".

In April, King Hussein of Jordan di sm issed his prim e m inister, Suleim an Nabulsi, am idst rum ors, apparently we ll-founded, of a coup against the King encouraged by Egypt and Syria and Palestinia ns living in Jordan. It was the turning point in an ongoing conflict between the pro- West policy of Hussein and the neutralist leanings of the Nabulsi regim e. Nabulsi had ann ounced tha t in lin e with his policy of neutralism , Jordan would develop closet re lations with the Soviet Union and accept Soviet aid if offered. At the sam e tim e, he rejected Am erican aid becaus e, he said, the United States had inform ed hi m that econom ic aid would be wit hheld unless Jordan \"severs its ties with E gypt\" and \"consents to settlem ent of Pale stinian refugees in Jordan\", a charge d enied by th e State Depa rtm ent. Nabulsi added the c omm entary that \"communism is not dangerous to the Arabs\". Hussein, conversely, accused \"internati onal communis m and its followers\" of direct responsibility for \"efforts to destroy my country\". W hen pressed f or the specifics of his accusation, he d eclined to prov ide any.

He d eclared martial law, purged th e governm ent and m ilita ry of pro-N asser and leftist tendencies, and abolished all political opposit ion. Jordan soon returned to a state of relative calm . The United States, however, seized upon Hussein' s use of the expression \"international comm uni sm \" to justify rushing units of the Sixth Flee t to the eas tern Mediterranean—a super aircraft carrier, two cruisers, and 15 destroyers, followed shortly by a variety of other na val vessels and a battalion of marines which put ashore in Lebanon—to \"prepare for possible fu ture intervention in Jordan\". 2 Despite the fact that nothing resem bling \"arm ed aggression from any country contro lled b y internatio nal comm unism \" ha d taken place, the State Departm ent openly invited the King to invoke the E isenhower Doctrine. 3 But Hussein, who had not even requested the show of force, refused, knowing that such a m ove would only add fuel to the fires already raging in Jordanian po litical life.

The United States chose to see som ething om inous in this although it was a state of affa irs engendered in no sm all m easure by John Fost er Dulles, as we saw in the previous chapter. Am erican antipathy toward Syria was heightened in Augus t following the Syrian governm ent's exposure of the CI A-directed plot to overthrow it. Washington officials an d the Am erican m edia s ettled e asily into the p ractice of ref erring to Syria as a \"Soviet sa tellite \" or \"quasi-s ate llite \". This was not altogether objective or spontaneous re porting. Kennett Love, a New York Times correspondent in close contact to the CIA (see Iran chapter), later disclosed som e of the background: The US Em bassy in Syria connive d at false r epo rts issued in Washingto n and Lo ndon through diplom atic and press c hannel s to the e ffect that R ussian arm s were pouring into the Sy rian port of Lat akia, that \"not m ore t han 123 M igs\" had arri ved i n Sy ria, and t hat Li eut enant C olonel Ab del Ha meed Serra j, head of Syrian in telligen ce, had taken ov er con trol in a Co mm unist-in spired coup .

Sy ria was quiet but worried l est the propaga nda presage a ne w coup d'etat or a West ern-bac ked invasi on. 5 As if to further convince any rem aining skeptics, Eisenhower dispatched a personal em issary, Loy Henderson, on a to ur of the Middle East. Henderson, not surprisingly, retu rned w ith the con clusion th at \"there was a fear in all Midd le E ast countries that the Soviets m ight be able to topple the regim es in each of their countrie s through exploiting th e crisis in Syria\". 6 He gave no indication as to whether the Syrians them selves thought they were going through a crisis. As an indication of how artificial we re the crises announced by the White House, how arbitrary w ere the doom sday pr onouncem ents about the S oviet Union, let us consider the following from a De partm ent of Defense internal m emorandum of June 1957, about two m onths before Hende rson went to the Middle East: Th e USSR h as sh own no in ten tio n of direct in terv ention in an y of th e prev ious Mid -Eastern crises, and we b eliev e it is un lik ely th at th ey wou ld interv ene, directly, to a ssure the s uccess of a leftist c oup in Syria. 7 In early Septem ber, the day after He nderson returned, th e United States announced that the S ixth Fleet was once again being sent to the Mediterranean and that arm s and other m ilitary equipm ent were being rushed to J ordan, Lebanon, Iraq and 90"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Turkey. A few days later, Saudi Arabia was added to the list. The Soviet Union replied with arm s shipm ents to Syria, Egypt and Ye men. The Syrian governm ent accused the US of sending warships dose to her coast in an \"open ch alleng e\" and said that u nidentifi ed planes had been fl ying constantly over the Latakia area day and night for four days, Latakia bein g the seaport where Soviet ships arrived. Syria further claim ed that the US had \"incited\" Turkey to concentrate an estim ated 50,000 soldiers on Syria' s border. Th e Syrians ridiculed th e explanation that the Turkish troops were only on m aneuvers. E isenhower later wrote th at the troops were at th e borde r with \" a re adiness to ac t\" and that th e United S tates had alrea dy assured the leaders of Turkey, Iraq and Jordan that if th ey \"felt it neces sary to take action s against aggression by the Syrian government, the Unit ed States would undertake to expedite shipm ents of ar ms already comm itted to the Middle Eastern countries and, further, would replace losses as quickly as possible. \" The president had no quarrel with the idea that such a ction m ight b e taken to repel, in his words, the \"anticipated aggression\" of Syria, for it would thus be \"basically defensive in nature\" (emphasis added). 8 The Am erican role here m ay have been m ore ac tive than Eisenhower suggests. One of his advisers, Emm et John Hughes, ha s written of how Unde r-Secretary of State Christian Herter, later to repl ace an ailing John Foster Dulles as Secretary, \"reviewed in rueful detail. .. som e recent clum sy clandestine Am erican atte mpts to spur Turkish forces to do som e vague kind of battle with Syria\". 9 Dulles g ave the im pression in pub lic rem arks that the United States was a nxious to som ehow invoke the Eisenhower Doctrine, pr esum ably as a \"justification\" for taking further action against S yria. But he could not offer any explanat ion of how this was possible. Certainly Syria was not going to m ake the necess ary request. The only solution lay in Syria attacking another Arab country which would then request American ass istance. This appears to be one rati onale behind the flurry of military and diplom atic activ ity d irected at Syria by the US. A study carried out for the Pentagon som e years later concluded that in \"the 1957 Syrian crisis ... W ashington seem[ed] to seek th e in itial use of force by target\" 10 (em phasis added; \"' target\" refers to Syria). Throughout this period, W ashington offici als alternated between striving to enlis t testimonials from other Arab nation s th at Syria was indeed a v ariety of So viet satellite and a threat to the region, and assuring the wo rld that the United S tates had received a profusion of just such test im ony. But Jordan, Iraq and S audi Arabia all denied that they felt threatened by Syria. Egypt, Syria' s closest ally, of course concurred. At the heig ht of the “crisis”, Ki ng Hussein of Jordan left for a vacatio n in Europe. The Iraqi prem ier declared that his country and Syria had arrived at a \"com plete understanding\". And King Saud of Saudi Arabia, in a m essage to Eisenhower, said that US concern over Syria was \"exaggerated\" and asked th e presid ent for \"rene wed assurances that the United St ates would refrain from any interf eren ce in th e inte rnal affairs of Arab states\". Saud added that \"e fforts to overturn the Syrian regim e would merely m ake the Syrian s m ore am enable to Soviet influence\", a view shared by several observers on all sides.

The next day, Syria, which had no desire to isolate itself from the W est, sim ilarly m oderated its tone by declaring that the Am erican warships had been 15 m iles offshore and had continued \"quietly on their way\". 11 It appears that during this sam e restless year of 1957, the United States w as also engaged in a plot to overthrow Nasser and his troublesom e nationalism, although the details are rather sketchy. In January, when King Saud and Iraqi Crown Prince Abdul Illah were in New York at the United Natio ns, they were approach ed by CIA Director Allen Dulles and one of his top aides, Kerm it Roosevelt, with of fers of CIA covert planning and funding t o topple the Egyptian l eader whose radical rhetoric, inchoate though it w as, was seen by the r oyal visitors as a th reat to the very idea of m onarchy. Nasser and other arm y officers had ove rthrown King Farouk of Egypt in 1952. Ironically, Kerm it Roosevelt and the CIA have tr adition ally been g iven c redit f or som ehow e ngineering this coup. However, it is by no means certain th at they actually carried th is out. 12 \"Abdul Illah,\" wrote E veland, \"ins isted on British participation in anything covert, but the Saudis had severed relations with Britain an d ref used. As a result, the CIA dealt separately with each: agreeing to fund King Saud' s part in a new area scheme to oppose Nasser and elim inate his influence in Syria; and to the sam e objective, coordinating in Beirut a covert w orking gr oup com posed of representatives of the British, Ir aqi, Jordanian, and Lebanes e inte lligenc e services.\" 13 The conspiracy is next picked up in mid-spring at the hom e of Ghosn Zogby in Beirut. Zogby, of Leba nese ancestry, was the chief of the CIA Beirut station. He and Kerm it Roosevelt, who was stayin g with him, hosted several conferences of the clandestine planners. \"S o obvious,\" Eveland continued, \"were their ' covert' gyrations, with British, Iraqi, Jordanian and Lebane se liaison personnel com ing and going nightly, that the Egyptian am bassador in Lebanon was reportedly taking bets on when and whe re the next U.S. coup would take place.\" At one of these meetings , the m an from the British Secr et In telligen ce Service ( SIS) inf ormed the ga thering that te am s had been fielded to assassinate Nasser. Shortly afterwards, Eveland learned from a CIA official that John Foster Dulles, as well as h is brothe r Allen, had dir ected R oose velt to work with the British to brin g down Nasser. Roosevelt now spoke in term s of a \"palace revolution\" in E gypt. 14 From this point on we' re f ishing in murky water s, for the ev ents which followed produced more questions than answers. W ith the six countries named above, plus Turkey and Israel apparently getting in on th e a ct, and le ss th an com plete trust and lo ve existing am ongst the various governm ents, a hos t of plots, sub-pl ots and side plots inevitably sprang to life; at tim es it borde red on low com edy, though som e would c all it no m ote than norm al Middle East \"diplom acy\". Between July 1957 and October 1958, the Egyptian and Syrian governments and media announced the uncovering of what a ppear to be at least eight separate conspiracies to overthrow one or the other gov ernm ent, to assass inate Nasser, and /or prevent the expected merger of the two countries. Saudi Arabia, Iraq and the United States were most often nam ed as c onspirato rs, but from the enta nglement of intrig ue which surfaced it is virtually im possible to unravel th e particular threads of the US role. 15 92"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Typical of the farcical goings-on, it seem s that at least one of the plots to assassinate Nasser arose from the Dulles brot hers taking E isenhower' s rem ark that he hoped \"the Nasser problem could be elim inated \" to be an order for assassination, w hen the president, so the story goes, was m erely referring to im proved US-Egyptian relations. U pon realizin g the error, Secr etary Dulles ord ered the operation to cease. 16 (Three years later, Allen Dulles was again to \"m isinterpret\" a rem ark by Eisenhower as an order to assassinate P atrice Lum umba of the Congo.) Official American prono uncem ents during this entire period would have had the world believ e that the S oviet Union was the eminence grise behind the strife in Jordan, the \"crisis\" in Syria, and unrest generally in the Middle E ast; tha t the So viet aim was to dom inate th e area, while the sole p urpose of US policy wa s to repe l th is Soviet thr ust and m aintain the \"indep endence\" of the Arab nations. Yet, on three sep arate occas ions during 1957—in February, April and Septem ber—the Soviet Union called for a four - power (US, USSR, Great Brita in and France) declaration renouncing the use of for ce and interference in th e internal affairs of the Middle Eastern countries. The February appeal had additionally calle d for a four-power em bargo on arm s shipm ents to the region, withdrawal of all foreign troops, liquidation of all foreign bases, and a conference to reach a g eneral M iddle East settlem ent. The Soviet strategy was clearly to neut ralize the Midd le East, to re move the threat it had long felt from the potenti ally hostile control of the oil region by, trad ition ally , France and Great Britain, and now the United States, which sought to fill the \"power vacuum \" left by the decline of the two European nations as Middle East powers. History does not relate what a Middle East free from bi g-power m anipulation would have been like, for neither France, Gr eat Br itain, nor the Unit ed St ates was am enable to even callin g the Soviet \"bluff\", if that was what it was. The New York Tim es summ arized the attitude of the three W estern nations to the fi rst two overtures as one that \"deprecated the Soviet proposals as efforts to gain recognition of a Soviet right to a direc t voice in the a ffairs of the Middle East. They have told the Russians to take up their com plaints through the United Nations.\" Following the Septem ber proposal, John Fost er Dulles, replying to a question at a press conference, said that \"the United Stat es is skeptical o f these arran gem ents with the Soviet Union for ' hands-off. What they are apt to m ean is our han ds off and their hands under the table.\" This appears to be the only public comment the US government saw f it to make on the m atter. 17 It m ay be in struc tive to specula te up on th e rea ction of the W estern na tio ns if the Soviet Union had announced a \"Khrushchev Do ctrine\", ceding to itself the sam e scope of action in the Middle East as that stipulated in the Eisenhower Doctrine. In January 1958, Syria and Egypt announced their plans to unite, form ing the new nation of the United Arab Republic (UAR). The initiative for the merger h ad come from Syria who was motiva ted in no sm all pa rt by her fear of further Am erican power plays against her. Ironically, under the m erger arrangem ent, the Communist Party, already outlawed in Egypt, was dissolved in Sy ria, an objective which a year and a half of CIA cove rt activity had failed to achieve. Two weeks after the birth of the U AR, a nd in direct response to it, Iraq and Jordan formed the Arab Union, with the Un ited States acting as midwife. This union was short lived, for in July a bloody c oup in Iraq overthrew the m onarchy, the new regim e establishing a republic and prom ptly renouncing the pact. The trum pets of Ar mageddon could once m ore be heard distinctly in the Oval Office. \"T his som ber turn 93"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"of events,\" wrote Eisenhower in his m emoirs, \"could, without vigorous response on our part, resu lt in a com plete elim ination of Wes tern influence in the Middle East.\" 18 Although the presiden t would not be so crass as to mention a concern about oil, his anxiety attack was likely brought on by the fact that one of the greatest oil reserves in the world was now under rule of a governm ent which m ight well prove to be not as pliable an ally as the previous regi me, and too independent of W ashington. The tim e for a m ere sh ow of force was over. The very next day, the m arines, along with the Am erican navy and air force, we re sent in—not to Iraq, but to Lebanon. Of all the Arab states, L ebanon was easily the United States' closest ally. She alone had supported the Eisenhower Doctrine with any e nthusiasm or unequivocally echoed W ashington' s panic about S yria. To be more precis e, it was th e pres iden t of Lebanon, Cam ille Chamoun, and the foreign m inister, Charles Malik, a Harvard Ph.D. in philosophy, who had put all their cold-war eg gs into th e Am erican b asket. Cham oun had am ple reason to be beholden to the United States. The C IA apparen tly played a role in his 1952 election, 19 and in 1957 the Agency furnishe d generous sum s of m oney to Cha moun to use in support of candidates in th e Cha mber of Deputies (P arliam ent) June elections who would back him and, presum abl y, US policies. Funds were also provided to specifically oppose, as punishm ent, those candidates who had resigned in protest over Cha moun' s adherence to the Eisenhower Doctrine. As is custom ary in suc h operations, the CIA se nt an \"election specialist\" along with the m oney to Beirut to assist in the planning. Am eric an officials in W ashington and Lebanon proceeded on the assumption, they told each other, that Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia would also intervene fina ncia lly in the ele ction s. The Am erican am bassador to L ebanon, Donald Heath, argu ed as well, apparently without ironic intention, that \"W ith both the president and the ne w cham ber of deputies supporting Am erican p rinciples, we' d also have a d emonstration that rep resen tative dem ocracy could work\" in the Middle East. To what extent the Am erican funding he lped, or even how the m oney was spent, is not known, but the result was a landslide for pro-governm ent deputies; so m uch so, that it caused considerable protest with in Lebanon, including the charge that Chamoun had stacked the parliam ent in order to am end the constitution to pe rm it him to seek a n otherwise prohibited second six-year term of offi ce the following year. 20 By late April 1958, tensions in L ebanon had reached b ursting po int. The inordinate pro-Am erican orie ntation of Cha moun' s governm ent and his refusal to dispel rum ors that he would seek a seco nd term incensed both Lebanese nationalists and advocates of the Arab nationalism , which Nasser was prom oting throughout the Middle East. Dem ands were made that th e governm ent return to the strict neu trality provided for in the National Pact of 1943 at the tim e of Lebanon' s declaration of independence from France. A rash of m ilitant dem onstrations, bom bings and clashes with police took place, and when, in early May, the editor of an anti-governm ent newspaper was m urdered, arm ed rebellion broke out in several parts of the country, and US Infor mation Age ncy libraries in Tripoli and Beirut were sacke d. Lebanon contained all the m akings of a civil war. \"Behind everything,\" wrote Eisenhower, \"was out deep-seated conviction that the Communists were princi pally responsible for the trouble and that President Cha moun was m otivated only by a st rong feeling of patriotism.\" The president did not clarify who or what he m eant by \"Communists\". However, in the next paragraph he refers, without expl anation, to the Soviet Union as \"stirring up 94"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"trouble\" in the Middle E ast. A nd on the following page, the ol d soldier writes that \"there was no doubt in our m inds\" about Cha moun' s charge that \"Egypt and Syria had been instig ating the revolt and arm ing the rebels\". 21 In the m idst of the fighting, John F oster Dulles announced that he perceived \"inte rnation al comm unism \" as the s ource of the conf lict and for the thir d tim e in a year the Sixth Fleet was dis patched to the easte rn Mediterranean; pol ice s upplies to help quell rioters, as well as tanks and other heavy equipm ent, were airlifted to Lebanon. At a subsequent news conference, Dulles dec lared that e ven if inter nationa l communis m were not involved, the Eisenhower Doctrine w as still applicable because one of its provisions stated that \"the indepe ndence of these countries is vital to peace and the na tional in tere st of the Unite d States. \" \"T hat is certainly a m andate,\" he said, \"to do som ethin g if we think that out p eace a nd vital interes ts are endangered from any quarter.\" 22 Thus did one of the authors of th e doctrine bestow upon him self a m andate. Egypt and Syria, from all accounts, suppor ted the rebels' cause with arm s, m en and m oney, in addition to inflamm atory radio broadcasts from Cairo, although the extent of the m aterial support is difficult to establish. A UN Observation Group went to Lebanon in June at the request of Foreign Minister Malik an d reported that they found no evidence of UAR intervention of any significance. A second UN report in July confirm ed this finding. It is open to questi on, however, what degree of reliance can be placed upon these repo rts, dealing as they do with so thorny an evaluatio n and issued by a body in the business of prom oting com prom ise. In any event, the issue was whether the conflict in Lebanon represented a legitim ate, h ome-grown civil war, o r whether it was the doing of the proverbial \"outside agitators\". On this point, histor ian Richard Barner has observed: No doubt the Obse rvation G roup did m inimize t he ext ent of U AR part icipation. Bu t essen tially th ey were correct. Nasse r was trying to exp loit th e po litical turm oil in Leb anon, but he di d not creat e it. Leba non, which had alway s abounde d in clande stine arsenal s and arm s market s, di d not need f orei gn wea pons for its domestic v iolence. Eg yptian in terv ention was n eith er th e stim ulus no r th e mainstay of the civil strife. Once a gain a governm ent that had l ost the po we r to rule effectiv ely was blam ing its failure on fo reig n ag ents. 23 President Eisenhower—continuing his flip -flop thinking on the issue—wrote that it now seem ed that Nasser \"would be just as happy to see a tem porary end to the struggle ... and contacted our governm ent and o ffered to attem pt to use his influence to end the trouble.\" 24 Ca mille Chamoun had sacrificed Lebanon' s independence an d neutrality on the alta r of pers onal am bitio n and the ex tensiv e Am erican aid tha t der ived f rom subscribing to the Eisenhower Doctrine. Lebanese Mu slim s, who comprised m ost of Cha moun's oppositio n, were also g alled that the Chtistian presiden t h ad once ag ain placed the country outside the m ainstream of the Ar ab world, as he had done in 1956 when he ref used to b reak re latio ns with Fra nce and Great Britain following their inv asion of Egypt.

Although scattered fighting, at tim es heavy, was continuing in Lebanon, it was the coup in Iraq on 14 July that tipped the scales in favor of Cha moun m aking the for mal request for m ilitary assis tance and the United Stat es imm ediately granting it. A CIA report of a plot against King Hussein of Jordan at about the sam e time heightened even further W ashington's seem ingly unceasing sen se of ur gency about the Middle East. Cha moun had, by this tim e, already announced his intention to step down from office when his term expired in S eptem ber. He was now concerned about Am erican forces helping him to stay alive until that date, a s well as the ir tak ing ac tion again st the rebels. For the previous two m onths, fear of assassination had kept him constantly inside the presiden tial palace, never so m uch as a pproach ing a window. The m urder of the Iraqi king and prim e m inister during th e coup was not designed to m ake hi m feel more secure. The Eisenhower Doctrine was put into m otion not only in the face of widespread oppositio n to it with in Lebanon, bu t in dis regard of the fact that, even by the doctrine's own dubious provisions, the situation in Leba non did not qualify: It could hardly be claim ed that Lebanon had suffered \"arm ed a ggression from any country controlled by international comm unism \". If further ev idence of this were needed , it was provided by veteran diplom at Robert Murphy who was sent to Lebanon by Eisenhower a few days after the US troops had landed. Murphy conclu ded, he later wrote, that \"communis m was playing no direct or substant ial p art in the ins urrec tion \". 26 Yet, Eisenhower could write that the Am erican Government \"was moving in accord with the prov isio ns of the Middle East Resolution [Eisenhower Doctrine], b ut if the conf lict expanded in to som ething that th e R esolution did not cover, I would, given tim e, go to the Congres s for additio nal authorization\". 27 Apparently the president d id not place to o m uch weight on John Foster Du lles having already determ ined that the Resolution' s m andate was open-ended. Thus it was that Am erican m ilitary forces were d ispatched to Lebanon. Som e 70 naval vessels and hundreds of aircraft took pa rt in the operation, m any rem aining as part of the visible Am erican presence.

By August 13, their num ber cam e to 1 4,000, m ore than the entire Lebanese Ar my and gendarm erie com bined. 28 \"In m y [radio-TV] address,\" wrote Eise nhower, \"I had been careful to use the term 'stationed in' Leba non rather than ' invading' .\" 29 This was likely a distinc tion lost upon m any Lebanese, both high and low, support ers of the rebels and supporters of the governm ent, including governm ent tank forces who were prepared to block the entrance into Be irut of US troop s; on ly th e last-m inute intercession on the spot by the Am erican am bassador m ay have averted an arm ed clash. 30 At a m eeting between Robert Mur phy and Lebanese C omm ander-in-Chief General Faud Chehab—related by Evela nd who was briefed by Murphy afterwards— the Am erican diplom at was warned that the Lebanese people were \"restless, resentf ul, and determ ined that Cham oun should resign and U.S. troops leave at once.

The authors of the Pentagon study referred to earlier concluded that \"A balanced assessm ent of U.S. behavior in the Lebanon cr isis is m ade difficult by the suspicion that the outcom e m ight have been m uch the sa me if the United States had done nothing. Even Eisenhower expressed som e doubt on this score.\" 33 Am erican interven tion agains t the new Iraqi governm ent was m ore covert. A secret p lan for a jo int US-Turkish inva sion of the country, code-nam ed Operation CANNON-BONE, was draf ted by the US joint Chie fs of Staf f shortly a fter the cou p in 1958. Reportedly, only Soviet threats to interc ede on Iraq' s side forced W ashington to hold back. But in 1960, the United States began to fund the Kurdish guerrillas in Iraq who were fighting for a m easure of a utonom y. 34 At the sam e tim e, the Iraqis, under Bri g. General Abdul Karim Kasse m, started to work towards the creation of an international organization to counter the power of the Western oil monopolies. This was to becom e OPEC, and was not receiv ed with joy in certain W estern quarters. In February 1960, the Near East Division of the CI A's clandes tine servic es req uested tha t the Ag ency f ind a way to \"incapacitate\" Kassem for \"prom oting Soviet bloc politi cal inte rests in Iraq \". \"W e do not consciously seek 97"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"subject' s perm anent removal from the scene, \" said the Near East Divis ion. \"W e also do not object should this complication develop.\" As matters turned out, the CIA maile d a m onogr ammed handkerchief containing an \"in capacitating agen t\" to Kas sem from an As ian country. If th e Iraq i leader d id in fact receive it, it certainly didn' t kill him . That was left to his own countrym en who executed h im three years later. 35 The significance of the Lebanese interven tion, as well as the shows o f force em ployed in regard to Jordan and S yria, extended beyond the imm ediate outcom es. In the period before and af ter the interven tion, E isenhower, Dulles and other W ashington officials of fered num erous dif ferent justif ica tio ns f or the Am erican m ilitary ac tion in Lebanon: protecting Am erican lives; protec ting Am erican property; the Eisenhowe r Doctrine, w ith var ious interpr etation s; Leba nese sovereignty, integrity, independence, etc.; US national interest; world p eace; co llective self-defense; ju stice; internatio nal law; law and order; fighting \"Nasseri sm \" ... the need to \"do som ething\" ... 36 In summ ing up the af fair in h is m emoirs, pres ident Eis enhower seem ed to se ttle upon one rationale in particular , and this is probably the cl osest to the truth of the matter. This was to put the world— and sp ecifically the Sov iet Union and Nasser—on notice that the United S tates had virtually unlim ited powe r, that this power could be transported to any corner of the world with great speed, that it c ould and would be use d to deal dec isively with any situa tio n with which the United States was dissatisf ied, f or whatever reason. 37 At the sam e tim e, it was a m essage to the British and the Fre nch that th ere was only one Western superpower in the post-war world, and that their days as great powers in the Lands of Oil were over. 14.

A few months ear lier, in May, Sukarno had m ade an im passioned speech bef ore the US Congre ss asking for more understanding of the problem s and needs of developing nations like his own. 2 The ensuing Am erican cam paign to unseat the flam boyant leader of the fifth most populous nation in the world was to run the gam ut from large-scale m ilitary maneuvers to seedy sexual intrigue. The previous year, Sukarno had orga nized the Bandung Conference as an answer to th e Southeas t Asia Treaty Orga niza tio n (SEATO), the US-c reated po litica l- military a lliance of are a sta tes to \"conta in co mmunism \". In the Ind onesian c ity of Bandung, the doctrine of neutralism had b een proclaim ed as the faith of the underdeveloped world. To the m en of the CI A station in Indonesi a the conference was heresy, so much so that their thoughts turned toward assassination as a m eans of sabotaging it. In 1975, the Senate com mittee which was i nvestigating the CIA heard testim ony that Agency officers statione d in an East Asian country had suggested that an East 98"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Asian leader be assassinated \"to disrupt an impending Communist [sic] Conference in 1955\". 3 (In all likelihood, the leader referred to was either Sukarno or Chou En-lai of China.) But, said the comm ittee, cooler heads prevailed at CIA headquarters in Washington and the suggestion was firm ly rejected. Nevertheless, a plane carrying eight members of the Chinese delegation, a Vietnam ese, and two E uropean journalists to the Bandung Conference crashed under mysterious circum stances. The Ch inese gov ernm ent claim ed that it was an ac t of sabotage carried out by the US and Taiwan, a m isfired effo rt to m urder Chou En-lai. The chartered Air India plane had take n off from Hong Kong on 11 A pril 1955 and crashed in the South China Sea. Chou En-lai was scheduled to be on another chartered Air India flight a day or two later. The Chinese governm ent, citing what it said were press reports from the Times of India , stated that the cras h was caused by two time bom bs apparently placed aboard the plan e in Hong Kong. A clockwork m echanis m wa s later recovered from the wrecked airliner and the Hong Kong police called it a case of \"carefully planned m ass murder\". M onths later, British police in Hong Kong announced that they were se eking a Chinese Nationa list for conspira cy to cause the crash, bu t th at he had fled to Taiwan. 4 In 1967 a curious little book a ppeared in India, entitled I W as a CIA Agent in India , by John Discoe S mith, an American. Pub lished by the Communist Party of India, it was b ased on ar ticles written by S mith f or Literaturnaya Gazeta in Moscow after he had defected to the Soviet Union around 1960. Sm ith, born in Quincy, Mass, in 1926, wrote that he had been a communications tec hnician and co de clerk at the US Em bassy in New Del hi in 1955, perform ing t asks for the CIA as well. One of these tasks was t o delive r a p ackage to a Chinese Nationa list which Sm ith late r lea rned, he claim ed, contained the two tim e bom bs used to blow up the Air Ind ia plan e. Th e veracity o f Sm ith' s account cannot be determ ined, although his em ploym ent at the US Embassy in New Delhi from 1954 to 1959 is confirm ed by the State Depar tment Biog rap hic Register . 5 Elsewhere the Senate co mmittee rep orted that it had \"received som e evidence of CIA involvem ent in plans to assassinate Pr esident Sukarno of Indonesia\", and that the planning had proceeded to the point of iden tifying an agent whom it was believ ed m ight be recruited for the job. 6 (The comm ittee noted that at one tim e, those at the CIA who were concerned with possibl e assassinations and appropr iate m ethods were known inte rnally as the \"Hea lth Altera tion C omm ittee\".) To add to the concern of Am erican leader s, Sukarno had m ade trips to the Soviet Union and China (though to the White House as well), he had purchased arm s from Eastern European countries (but only after being turned down by the United States), 7 he had nationalized m any private holdings of th e Dutch, and, perhaps m ost disturbing of all, the Indonesian Communist Party (PK1) had m ade i mpressive gains electorally and in union-o rganizing, thus earning an importa nt ro le in the coalition gov ern ment. It was a fam iliar Third W orld scenario, and th e reaction o f W ashington policy- makers was equally fam iliar. Once again, they were unable, or unwilling , to distinguish nationa lism from pro-communism , neutra lism from wickedness. By any def inition of the word, Sukarno was no communist. He was an Indonesian nationalist and a \"Sukarnoist\" who had crushed the PKI forces in 1948 after the independence struggle had been w on. 8 He ran what was largely his own s how by granting concessions to both the PKI and the Arm y, balancing one against th e other. As to excludi ng th e PKI, with its more than o ne m illion m embers, from the governm ent, Sukarno declared: \"I can' t and won' t ride a three-legged horse.\" 9 99"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"To the United States, ho wever, Sukarno' s balancing act was too precariou s to be left to the vagaries of the Indonesian politic al process.

Intervention there would be. It would not be the first. In 1955, during the national election cam paign in Indonesia, the CIA had given a m illion dollars to the Mas jumi party, a centris t coalition of Muslim organizations, in a losing bid to th wart Sukarno' s Nationali st Party as well as the PKI. According to for mer CIA offi cer Joseph Burkholder Sm ith, the project \"provided for com plete write-off of the funds, that is, no dem and for a detailed accounting of how the funds were spent was requ ired.

It was not difficult to find Indonesian co lleagues- in-a rms f or there already existed a clique of arm y officers and others who, for personal am bitions and because they dis liked the influential position of the PKI, want ed Sukar no out, or at least out of their particular islands.

The m anner in which the Agency went about obtaining this approval is a textbook exam ple of how the CIA som etim es determ ines Am erican foreign policy. Joseph Burkholder Smith, who was in charge of the Agency' s Indonesian desk in Washington from m id-1956 to early 1958, has described the process in his m emoirs: Instead of first proposing the plan to W ashington for approval, where \"prem ature mention ... m ight get it shot down\"... we be gan to fe ed the State and De fense de partm ents intelligence t hat no one could deny was a useful contribution to unde rst andi ng Indonesi a.

This wa s all we needed to convince John Foster Dulles finally that he had the wrong m an in Indonesia. The wheels began to turn to rem ove this last stum bling block in the way of our operation.\" 12 John Allison, wrote Sm ith, was not a great adm irer of the CIA to begin with. And in early 1958, after less than a year in the pos t, he was replaced as am bassador by Howar d Jones, whose selection \"pleased\" the C IA Indonesia staff. 13 100"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"On 30 Nove mber 1957, several hand grenades were tossed at Sukarno as he was leaving a school.

The CIA in Indonesia had no id ea who was responsible, but it quickly put out the story that the PKI was behind it \"a t th e suggestion of their Soviet c ontacts in order to m ake it appear that Sukarno' s opponents were wild and desperate m en\". As it turned out, the culprits were a Muslim group not as sociated with the PKI or with the Agency' s m ilitary plotters. 14 The issue of Sukarno' s supposed hand-in -glove relationshi p with Communists was pushed at every opportuni ty.

W hen scrutiny of available po rno films (suppl ied by the C hief of Police of Los Angeles) f ailed to turn up a couple w ho could pass for Sukar no ( dark a nd bald) and a beautiful blonde Russian wom an, the CIA undertook to produce its own films, \"the v ery films w ith w hich the S oviets w ere blackmaili ng Sukarno\".

Maheu' s fil m starred an actor who rese mbled Sukarno. The ultim ate fate of the fil m, which was entitled \"Happy Days\", has not be en reported. 16 In other parts of the worl d, at other times , the CIA has done better in this line of work, having produced sex fil ms of target subjects caught in flagrante delicto who had been lured to Agenc y sa fe-houses by fe male age nts. In 1960, Col . Truma n Smith, US Army Ret., writing in Reader's Di gest about the KGB, declared : \"It is d ifficult for most of us to appreciate its menace, as its m ethod s are s o debased as to be all but beyond th e com prehension of any norm al person with a sense of right and wrong.\" One of t he KG B methods the good colonel found so debased was the m aking of sex fil ms to be used as blackm ail. \"People depraved enough to employ such m ethods,\" he wrote, \"find not hing di stasteful in more violent m ethods.\" 17 Sex could be used at hom e as well to further the goals of Am erican foreign policy.

Operation Gladio The rationale behind it was your standa rd cold-war parano ia: There' s a good chance the Russians will launc h an unprovoked invasion of Western Europe. And if they defeated the W estern arm ies and forced the m to f lee, certa in people had to rem ain behind to harass the Russians with guerrilla wa rfare and sabotage, and act as liaiso ns with those abroad. The \"stay-behinds\" would be provided with funds, weapons, communication equipment and training exer cises. The planning for this covert param ilita ry network, c ode-nam ed \"Operation G ladio\" (Italian for \"sword\"!, began in 1949, invol ving i nitially the British, the Ame ricans and t he Belgians. It eventua lly established units in eve ry non-communist country in Europe—includi ng Greece and Turke y and neutral Swe den a nd Switzerland— with the ap parent ex ceptions of Ir eland and Finland. The question of whethe r the units were m ore under the control of national governm ents or NATO re mains purposely unc lear, although from an oper ational point of view, it appears that the CIA and v arious ot her intelligence servi ces were calling the shots. As matters turned out, in the comp lete absence of any Rus sian invasi ons, the operation was used al most exclusively to in flict political damage upon domestic leftist mo vements. The Gla dio story broke in Italy in t he fall of 1990, ste mmi ng from a j udici al investigation into a 1972 car -bombi ng whic h di scovere d that the explosi ves ha d c ome from one of the 139 secr et w eapons depots kept for Gladio's forces in Italy.

What held th em toget her was o ne ide ological co mmon denominat or: extre me rightis m.\" As in Ger many (see Ger many chapt er), th e Italian operation was closely tied to terrorists. A for mer Gladio agent, R oberto Cavallero, went public to ch arge th at th ere wa s a direct link between Gladio and Italy' s wave of terrorist bom bings in t he 1970s and early 1980s which left at leas t 300 dead. He said that Glad io had trained him and many others \"to prepare groups which, in the event of an advanc e by left wing forces in our country, would fill the s treets, creating a situat ion of such tension as to require m ilitary intervention.\" Cava llero was of course referring to elec toral adva nce s of the Ita lian Communist Party, not a n invasion by the Soviet Union. The single worst terrorist action was the bombing at the Bologna railway station in August 1980 which cla imed 86 live s.

He is apparently under the prot ective wing of MI6 (Britain's CI A) for whom he ha s provi ded valuable intell igence. The kidnapping and murder in 1978 of Aldo Moro, the leader of t he Chri stian Dem ocrats, which was attributed to the Red Brigades, appears now to have also been the work of Gladio agents p rovocateurs who inf iltrated the organization. Just prior to h is abduction, Moro had announced his intention to enter into a governmental coalition with the Communist Party. In Belgium, in 1983, to convinc e the public that a security crisis existed, Gladio operatives as well as police officers staged a series of see mingly random shootings in superm arkets which, wh ether in tended or not, led to several d eaths. A year later, a party of US Marines par achuted in to Belg ium with the in tention o f attack ing a police station.

British Guiana 1953-1964 The CIA's international labor mafia For a period of 11 years, two of t he oldest dem ocracies in the world, Great Brita in and the United States, went to grea t len gths to prev ent a dem ocratically ele cted leader from occupying his office. The m an was Dr. Cheddi Jagan. The gra ndson of indentured imm igrants from India, Jagan had become a dentist in the United States, then returned to his native Guiana. In 1953, at the age of 35, he and th e People' s Progressive Parry (PPP) were elected by a large m ajority to head the governm ent of the British colony. Jagan' s victory was due in part to the f act that Indians com prised about 46 percent of the population; those of African origin made up about 36 percent. The PPP' s program in office was hardly revolutionary. It encouraged foreign investm ent in the m ining sectors w hile attem pting to institute liber al reform s such as strengthening the rights of unionists and tenant f arm ers, creating a public school syste m that would lessen church control of edu cation, and rem oving a ban on the im port of \"undesirable\" publications, film s and records. But the Brit ish Conservative government was not disp osed to live with such p olicies advocated by a m an who talked suspiciously like a so cia list. Th e gov ernm ent and the Britis h m edia, as well as the Am erican m edia, subjected th e Jagan administration to a cam paign of red-s care accusation s and plain lies 107"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"in the fashion of Senator McCar thy whose -is m was then ail the rag e in the Un ited States. Four and a half m onths after Jagan took offic e, the governm ent of W inston Churchill flung him out.

At the sam e ti me, the barristers drew up som e papers which the Qu een signed, so it was alt n ice and lega l. 1 \"Her Majesty' s Government,\" said th e British Co lonia l Secretary during a debate in Par liam ent, \" are not prepar ed to tole rate th e setting up of Co mmunist states in the British Com monwealth.\" 2 The Am erican attitude toward th is s lap in the face of dem ocracy can be surm ise d by the refusal of the US governm ent to allow Jagan to pass in transit through the United States when he tried to book a flight to London to attend the parliam entary debate. According to Jagan, Pan Am would not even sell him a ticket. (Pan Am has a l ong history of collabo ration with the CIA, a practic e initiated b y the airline' s presiden t, Juan Trippe, th e s on-in- law of Roosevelt' s Secretary of State, Edwar d R. Stettin ius.) 3 By this tim e the CIA ha d already go tten its foot in the door of the British Guiana labor movement , by me ans of the marriage of the Agency to the American Federation of Labor in the United St ates. One of the early offs prings of this uni on was the Inter- American R egional Labor Organization (ORIT from the Spanish). In the early 1950s, ORIT w as instrum ental the conversion of the leading confeder ation of unions in Guiana, the Trades Union Council , from a militant labor organization t o a vehicle of anti-commu nis m. Wrote Sera fino Ro mua ldi, at one tim e the head of AIFLD (see below) and a long-tim e CIA collaborator: \"Since m y first visit to British Guiana in 1951, I did everything in m y power to strengthen the de mocratic [i.e., anti-communist] trade union forces oppos ed to hi m [Jagan].\" 4 This was to have serious repercussions for Jagan in later years. In 1957, running on a pr ogra m similar to th at of four years e arlier, Jagan won t he election again. Following this, the British dee med it wiser to em ploy m ore subtle methods for his rem ova l and the CIA was brought into the picture, one of the rare instances in which the Agency has been of ficially allowed to operate in a British bailiw ick. The C IA has done so, uno fficially, on nu merous o ccasions, to the displeasur e of British authorities. The C IA set to w ork to fortify tho se uni ons whi ch alrea dy te nded s ome what toward support of Jagan's le ading political opponent, Forb es Burnham of the People 's Nati onal Congre ss. O ne of t he mos t impor tant of t hese wa s the civil s ervants ' uni on, dom inated by blacks. Consequently, the C IA turned to P ublic Service s Internation al (P SI) in L ondon, an international trade union sec retariat for governm ent e mploye es, one of the international networks w hich exist to export the union know-h ow of advanced industrial countries to l ess-develope d countries. Accor ding t o a study undertaken by The Sunday Times of London, by 1958 the PSI's \"finances were low, and its stocks were low with its own par ent body, t he International Confeder ation of Free Trade Uni ons [s et up by the CI A in 1949 to ri val t he Soviet-i nflue nced Worl d Federati on of Trade Un ions ]. It ne eded a succe ss of some kind. The f inancial crisis was resolved, quite sudd enly, by the PSI 's m ain Am erican aff iliate uni on, the Ameri can Federation of St ate, County and Municipal Em ployees (A FSC ME).\" AFSCME's bos s, Dr Ar nol d Zander , told the PSI executive that he had \" been s hopping\" and had found a donor. \"The spoils were m odes t at first-on ly a couple of thousand pounds in 1958. It was, the kind donor had said, for Latin Am erica. The m oney went towards a PSI 108"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"'recruiting drive' in the northern countries of Latin America by one William Doherty, Jr., a m an w ith som e previous acquaintance of the C IA.\" (Doherty was later to becom e the Executive Director of the American Institu te for Free Labor Development, the CIA' s principal labor orga nization in Latin America.) \"The donor was presumably pleased, because next year, 1959, Zander was able to tell the PSI that his union was opening a full-tim e Latin American section in the PSI' s behalf. T he P SI was charm ed.\" The PSI' s represen tativ e, said Zan der, would be W illiam Howard McCabe (a CIA. labor apprentice). The Times continued: McCabe, a stocky, bullet-headed American, appeared to have no previous union history, but the PSI liked him . When he cam e to its m eetings, he distri buted cigarette lighters and photographs of hi mself doling out food par cels to the peasants. The lighters and the parcels were both inscribed \"with the complim ents of the PSI\". 5 In 1967, in the wake of num erous revela tions about CIA covert financing, the new head of AFSCME adm itted that the uni on had been heavily funded by the Agency until 1964 through a founda tion conduit (see Appe ndix I). It was revealed that AFSCME's International Affairs Depart ment, whi ch had been responsi ble for the British Guiana operation, had actually been run by two CIA \"aides\". 6 CIA work within Third World unions Typically involves a considerable educational ef fort, the basic prem ise of which is that all solu tions will co me to working people unde r a syste m of free enterprise, cl ass co-operation and collective bargaining, and by opposing com munism in co llaboration w ith m anagement and governm ent, unless, of cou rse, th e g overnment, as in this case, is itself \"communist\". The most prom ising students, those perhaps m arked as future l eaders, are singled out to be sent to CIA schools in the United Sta tes for further education. The CI A, s aid The S unday Times , also \"appears to have had a good deal of success in encouraging politicians to break away from Jaga n’s party an d governm ent. Their technique of financi ng sympathetic figures was to t ake out hea vy insurance policies f or them .\" 7 During the 1961 election ca mpaign, the CIA' s ongoing program was augm ented by a d hoc operations from other American qua rters. The US Inform ation Service took the most unusual step of showing its film s, depicting the evils of Castroism and communis m, on street c orners of British Gu iana. And the Christian Anti-Communist Crusade brought its traveling road show down and spent a reported $76,000 on electoral propaganda which lived up to the organization' s na me. 8 One historian has described this as \"a que stiona ble activity for a pri vate or ganiz ation, which the State Depart ment di d nothing to discourage\" . 9 On the other hand, the a ctivities of US government agencies in British Guiana were no less questionable. Despite t he orchestrated cam paign di rected against hi m, Jaga n was re-ele cted by a com fortable m ajority of legislative seats, though with only a plurality of the popular vote. In October, at his request, Jagan was r eceived at the W hite House in W ashington. He had come to talk about assistance f or his development pr ogra m. Pre sident Ke nne dy and his advisers, howe ver, we re interested in determ ining where Jaga n stood on the political spectrum be fore granting any aid. O ddly, the meeting, as described by Kenne dy aide Ar thur Schlesinger, Jr. who was present, see med to be c onducte d as if the Ke nne dy men were totally unaware of American de stabilization activities in British Guiana. To Jagan' s expressed esteem for the politics of British Labour leader Aneurin Bevan, those in the room \"all responded agreeably\". 109"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"To Jagan' s professed socialism , Kennedy asserted that “W e are not engaged in a crusade to force private enterp rise on part s of th e world where it is not relevant”. But when J agan, perhaps naively, mentioned his adm iration for the scholarly, lef tist jo urnal, Monthly Review, it a ppears that he cross ed an ideological line, which silently and effectively s ealed his country' s fate. \"Jagan,\" wr ote Schlesinger later, \"was unquestionably som e sor t of “Marxism.” 10 No economic aid was given to British Guiana while Jagan rem ained in power, and the Kennedy adm inistration p ressured th e British to delay granting the country its inde pendence, which had been scheduled to occur within the next year or two. 11 Not until 1966, when Jagan no longer held office, did Br itish Guiana becom e the independent nation of G uyana. In February 1962, the CIA helped to or ganize and financ e anti-Jagan protests which used the newly a nnounced budget as a pretext. The resulting strikes, riots and arson w ere wholly out of proportion to the alleged instigation. A Commonwe alth Commission of Enquiry l ater concluded (perhaps to the discomfort of the British Coloni al Office which had appointed it) that: Th ere is very little d oub t th at, desp ite t he loud pro testation s of th e tr ades un ion lead ers to the con trary, political affin ities an d asp iration s played a larg e part in sh aping their po licy and form ulating their pro gramme o f offering resistan ce t o the budg et and m aking a determined effor t to change the governm ent in office. 12 The CIA arranged, as it has on sim ilar oc casions, for North Am erican and Latin American la bor organiza tions, with which it ha d close ties, to support the strikers with mes sages of solidarity and food, t hus enha nci ng the a ppe arance of a genuine la bor struggle. The agency als o cont rived for previously unheard-of radio stations to go on the air and for newspapers to print false st ories about approaching Cuban war ships. 13 The cente rpiece of th e CIA' s program in Britis h Guiana w as the general s trik e (so called, although its support was considerably less than total) which began in Apr il 1963. It lasted for 80 da ys, the longe st general strike in history, it is said. 14 This strike, as in 1962, was called by th e Trades Union Council (TUC) which, as we have see n, was a me mber in good standi ng of the CI A's International labor m afia . The head o f th e T UC was one R ichard Is hm ael who had be en trained in the US at t he CIA's Am erican Institute for Free Labor De velopment along with other Guianese labor officials. The strike period was marke d by repeat ed act s of vi olenc e and provocation, including att acks on Jagan' s wi fe and som e of his m inisters. Ishm ael hi msel f wa s later cited in a secret British police report as having been part of a terrorist gro up which had carried out bom bings and arson attacks agai nst governm ent buildings during the strike. 15 No action was taken agains t Ish mael and others in this group by British authori ties who missed no opportunity to exacer bate the explosive situation, hoping t hat it would culm inate in Jagal’s downfall. Meanwhile, CIA a gents were giving \"a dvice to local union leaders on how to organize and sustain\" the strike, the New York Times subsequently reported. \"They als o provi ded funds and food supplies to keep the strikers going and m edical supplies for pro- Burnham workers injure d in the tur moil. At one point, one of the agents even served as a member of a bargaining comm ittee from a Guiana dike workers 1 union that was negotiating with Dr. Jagan.\" This agent was later denounced by Jagan a nd forbidde n to enter the co untry. 16 This is probably a reference to Ge ne Meakins, one of the CIA' s main labor operatives, who ha d been servi ng as public relations advisor and e ducation offic er 110"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"to the TUC.

Am erican oil companies provided a furthe r example of the multitude of resources the US can bring to bear upon a given targ et. The companies co-operated with the strikers by refusing to provide petroleum , forcing Jagan to appeal to Cuba for oil. During Jagan' s rem aining year in office, in the face of a general US econom ic em bargo, he turned in creas ingly to th e Soviet bloc. This practice of course provided amm unition to thos e c ritics of Jag an in Br itish Guiana, th e United S tates and Gre at Brita in w ho insisted that he was a communist and thus fr aught with all the dangers that commun ists are fraught with. The strike was m aintaine d prim arily by bl ack sup porters of F orbes Burnh am and by e mployers who locked out m any of Jaga n's Indian supporters. This inevitably exacerb ated the already existi ng racial ten sion s, although The Sunday Times asserted that the \"racial split was fairly am icable until the 1963 strike divided the country\" . Eventually, the tension broke out into bl oodshed leaving hundreds dead and wounded and \"a legacy of racial bitterness\". 19 Jagan was certainly aware, to som e extent at least, of what was transpiring around him during the general strike. After it was over he charged that: Th e Un ited St ates, in sp ite of pro testatio ns to th e con trary by so me of its lead ers, is n ot prep ared to perm it a So cialist g over nment or a g overnm ent committed to drastic and basic refo rm s to ex ist in th is h emisp here, ev en wh en th is g overn ment has been freely elected ... It is all to o clear that th e Un ited States will o nly suppo rt a dem ocrat ic gove rnment if it fa vors a classic private e nterprise syste m. 20 In an a ttem pt to surm ount the hurd le of US obsession with the Soviet Union and \"another Cuba in the Wester n hem isphere\", Jagan proposed that British Guiana be \"neutralized\" by an agreem ent between the Un ited States and the Soviet Union, as the two powers had done in the case of Austria. Officials in W ashington had no comm ent on the suggestion. 21 Cheddi Jagan' s governm ent m anaged to survive all the provocations and hum iliations . W ith elections on the agenda for 1964, the British and their Am erican cousins turned once again to the gentlem anly way of the pen. The British Colonial Secretary, Duncan Sandys, who had been a leading party to the British-CIA agreement concern ing Jagan, ci ted the strike and general unrest as proof that Jagan could not run the country or offe r the stability that the British governm ent required for British Guiana to be granted it s independence. (Sandys was the founder, in 1948, of The European Movem ent, a CI A-funded cold-war organization.) 22 111"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"This was, of course, a contrived position. Syndicated Am erican colum nist Drew Pearson, writing about the m eeting betw een Presiden t Kennedy and British P rime Minis ter Macm illan in the summ er of 1963, stated that \"th e m ain thing they agreed on was that the British would ref use to grant independence to Guiana because of a general strike against pr o-Communi st Pr ime M inister, Cheddi Jagan. That strike was secretly inspir ed by a combina tion of U.S. Centra l In telligence m oney and Britis h intelligenc e. It gave London the excuse it wanted.\" 23 The excuse was used f urther to ju stif y an amendm ent to the Br itish Guiana constitution providing for a system of pr oportional representation in the election, a system that appeared certain to co nvert J agan' s m ajority of legisla tiv e seats in to a plurality. Su bsequently, the British-appoint ed G overnor of British Guiana announced that he would not be bound to call on the l eader of the largest party to form a governm ent if it did not have a m ajority of seat s, a procedure in striki ng contrast to that followed in Great Britain. When, in October 1964, the Labour Party succeeded the Conservative P arty to power in Great Britain, Jagan had hopes that the conspiracy directed against him would be squashed, for several high-ranking Labour leaders had stated publ icly, and to Jagan personally, their opposition to the underhanded a nd anti-dem ocratic policy of their Conservative Party foes. W ithin days of taking office, however, the Labour P arty dashed these hopes. 24 \"Bowing to United States wishes,\" the New York Times disclosed, the Labour Party \"ru led out ear ly in dependence f or British Guiana\" and was going ahead with the proportional representation elections. Secretar y of State Dean Rusk, it was reported, had left the new British Foreign Secretary, Pa trick Gordon-W alker, \"in no doubt that the United Sta tes would r esist a r ise of Britis h Guiana as an independ ent Castro-type state\". 25 On a p revious occasion, Rusk had urged Gord on-W alker' s Conservative predece ssor, Lord Hom e, to suspend the British Guiana constitu tion aga in and \"rever t to direct colonial governm ent\". 26 The intensive Am erican lobbying effort against British Guiana (the actual cam paign of subversion aside), led Conserva tive MP and form er Colonial Secretary, Iain M acleo d, to observ e in the Ho use of Commons: \"There is an irony which we all recognize in the fact of Am erica urging us all over the world towards colonial freedom except when it app roach es her own d oorstep. \" 27 The day before the election of 7 Dec ember, a letter appeared in a British Guiana newspaper—a bogus pro-Communist letter, a tactic the CIA has used successfully the world over. The letter was purportedly writ ten by Jagan' s wif e Janet to Comm unist Party m embers, in which she stated: \" We can take comfort in th e thought that the P NC [Burnha m's party] will not be able to stay in p ower long .. . our communist com rades abroad will continue to help us win eventual total victory.\" Ms. Jagan quickly retorted th at she would not be so stup id as to write a letter like that, bu t, as in all s uch cas es, the dis claim er trailed wea kly and too late beh ind the accusation. 28 As expected, Jagan won only a plurality of the legislative seats, 24 of 53. The governor then called upon Forbes Burnham , who had com e in second, to for m a new governm ent. Burnha m had also been na med as a terrorist in the British police report referred to earlier, as had severa l of his new governm ent m inisters. Jagan refused to resign.

Soviet Union late 1940s to 1960s From spy planes to book publi shing Inform ation ... hundreds of young Am erican s and ém igré Russians gave their lives so that the United States cou ld am ass as much inform ation as pos sible abou t the Soviet Union ... alm ost any inform ation at al l about the land Church ill had described as \"a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigm a\". There is no evidence, ho wever, that any of the infor mation colle cted ev er saved any lives, or served any other useful purpose for the world. Today, tons of files stuffed with reports, volum es of com puter printouts, tapes, phot ographs, etc., lie in filing cabinets, gathering dust in warehouses in the United States and West Germ any. Probably a good part of the m aterial has al ready been shredded. Much of it has never been looked at, and never will b e. Beginning in the late 19 40s, the US m ilitary, th e CIA and th e Nationa l S ecurity Agency regul arly sent ai rcraft along the borders of the Sovi et Union to colle ct v isual, photograph ic and electronic data of a m ilitary or industrial nature, p articu larly to do with Soviet m issile and nucle ar capability. The increasingl y sophisticated planes and equipm ent, as well as satellites, subm arines, and electronic listening posts in Turkey and Iran, produced vast amounts of computer input. At tim es, the planes would unintentionally drift over Soviet territory. At other tim es, they would do so intentionally in order to photograph a particular target, or to activate radar installations so as to capture their signals, or to evaluate the re action of Soviet ground defenses against an 113"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"attack. It was a dangero us gam e of aerial \"chicken\" and on m any occasions the planes were m et by anti-aircraft fire or Soviet fighter planes. In both 1950 and 1951, an espionage airplane with a crew of ten was shot down, with no survivors. In 1969, a crew of 31 was lost, this tim e to No rth Korean fighters over the Sea of Japan. D uring the intervening years, there w ere do zens of air incid ents involving A merican aircraft and Comm unist firepower, aris ing from hundreds, if not thousands, of espionage flights. Som e of the spy planes m ade it safely back to base (which m ight be Turkey, Iran, Greece, Pakist an, Japan or Norway) after being attack ed, and even hit; others were downed with loss of life or with c rew m embers captured by the Soviets. 1 There has been considerable confusion concerning the number and the fate of US airm en captured by the Soviets after their planes m ade forced la ndings or were shot down during the 1950s and ' 60s. Russian presiden t Boris Yeltsin stated in 1992 that nine US planes had been shot down in the early 1950s and twelve Am erican survivors had been he ld p risoner, th eir ultim ate f ate no t yet discovered. Five m onths later, Dm itri Volkogonov, for mer Soviet general and co-c hairm an of a Russian-U S comm ission investigatin g the whole question of m issing Am eric ans, told a US Senate comm ittee that 730 airm en had been captured on cold war s py flights, their fate likewise unclear. 2 The m ost notable of th ese inciden ts wa s of course the downing of the U-2 piloted by Francis Gary Powers on 1 Ma y 1960. The ultra high-flying U-2 had been developed b ecause of the vulnerability to b eing shot do wn of planes f lying at norm al altitu des. The disappearance of Powers and his U-2 som ewh ere in the Soviet Unio n ensnared the United States governm ent publicly in an enta nglem ent of a false cover story, denials, and am endm ents to de nials. Finally, when the Russians presented Powers and his plane to the world, President Eisenhower had no alternative but to adm it the truth. He pointedly added, however, that flights such as the U-2' s we re \"distasteful but vital\", given the Russian \"fetish of secrecy and concealm ent\". 3 One of Eisenhower' s advisers, Emm et John Hughes, was later to observe that it thus took the adm inistration only six days \"to transfor m an unthinkable falsehood into a sovereign right.\" 4 On several occasions, the United States pro tested to the Soviet Unio n about Soviet attacks on Am erican planes which we re not actually over Soviet territory, but over the Sea of Japan, for exam ple. Though enga ged in espionage, such flights, strictly speaking, appear to be accepta ble under international law. The m ost serious repercussion of the w hole U-2 af fair was that it do om ed to failure the Eisenhower-Khrushchev summ it meeting which took place two weeks later in Paris, and upon which so m uch hope for p eace and detente had been placed by peop le all over the world. Was the U-2 affair the unfortunate accident of tim ing that history has m ade it out to be? Col. L. Fletcher Prouty, US Air For ce, Ret. has suggested otherwise. From 1955 to 1963, Prouty served as th e liaison between the CIA a nd the Pentagon on m atters concern ing m ilitary sup port of \"sp ecial operations\". In his book, The Secret Team, Prouty suggests that the CIA and c ertain of the Agency' s colleagues in the Pentagon sabotaged th is par ticu lar U-2 flight, the last one scheduled before the summ it. They did this, presum ably, because they did not relish a lessening of cold -war tensions, their raison d'être. The m ethod em ployed, Prouty surm ises, was rem arkably sim ple. The U-2' s engine needed infusions of liquid hydrogen to m aintain the plane' s incr edible altitu de, which placed it outside the range of Soviet firepower an d interc epto r airc raft. If the hydrogen container were only partly filled upon takeoff from Turkey, it would be 114"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"sim ply a matte r of tim e—calcu lable to co incide with th e plane b eing over Sov iet terr ito ry—b efore the U -2 was f orced to de sce nd to a lo wer altitud e. At this p oint, whether the plane was shot down or Powers bailed out, a llowing it to crash, is not certain. The Soviet Union cl aim ed that it had shot down the U-2 at its norm al hi gh altitude with a rocket , but this was probably a falsehood bor n of four years of frustrating failure to shoot a single U-2 from the sky. In any event, the Russians were able to present to the world a partially intact spy pla ne along with a fully intact spy p ilot, com plete with all m anne r of incrim inating pa pers on him , and an unused suicide needle. The presen ce of identification pap ers was no oversight, says Prouty: deliberately, \"neith er p ilo t not plane were sanitized on this flight as was required on other flights\". 5 Powers, in his book, doesn' t discuss the liq uid hydrogen at ad. He believed his plane was disabled and forced to descend by the shock waves of a Soviet near-m iss. But he recounts technical problem s with the plane ev en before the presum ed near-m iss. 6 In light of the furor rais ed by the sh ooting down of a South Korean com mercial airliner by the Soviet U nion in 1983, wh ich the Russians claim ed was spying, it i s interesting to note that Prouty also makes m ention of the United States at one tim e using \"a seem ingly clean national comm ercial airlin e\" of an unspecified foreign country \"t o do som e ca mera spying or other clandestine project\". 7 To the Russians, the sp y planes were m ore than sim ply a violation of their air space, and they rejected the notion p ut forth by the US that the flights w ere ju st ano ther for m of espionage—\"intelligence collection activities are p racticed by all coun tries \", said W ashington. 8 (At the tim e there had been no indi cation of Soviet flights over the United States.) 9 The Russians viewed the flights as particularly provocative because airplanes are a m eans of conducting warfare, th ey can be considered as the beginning of hostilities, and m ay even be carry ing bom bs. The Russians could not forget that the Nazis had p receded their invasion o f the S oviet Union with frequent reconnaissan ce overflights. Neither could they forget that in A pril 1958, US planes carrying nuclear bom bs had flown over the Arctic in the dire ctio n of the USSR due to a f alse warning signal on A merican radar. The planes were called back when only two hours flying tim e separated them from the Soviet Union. 10 No Am erican plane dropped bombs on th e S oviet Union but m any of them dropped m en assigned to carry out hostile missions. The m en who fell from the sky were Russians who had em igrated to the W est where they were recruited by the CI A and other W estern intelligence organizations. The leading émigré organization was known a s National Alliance of Russian Solidarists, or the National Union of Labor (NTS). It was com posed largely of two distinct groups: the sons of the Russians who had gone to the W est following the revolution, and those Russians who, through circum stance or choice, had wound up in Western Europe at the close of the Sec ond World W ar. Mem bers of both groups ha d collaborated with the N azis during the war. Although NTS was genera lly classified in the right wing of the various ém igré orga niz ations, the ir coll aboration had been motivated m ore by anti- Stalin ism than by pro-N azi sen tim ents. NTS was based prim arily in W est Germ any where, throughout the 1950s, the CIA was the organization' s chief benefactor, often its sole support. At a CIA school set up in Germ any, under the im posing nam e of the Institute for the Study of the USSR, as well as at schools in Great Britain and the United Stat es, the Agency provided N TS members with extens ive tra ining bef ore airdr opp ing them into Soviet te rritory. The m en landed on their native soil elaborately equipped, with everything from weapons to collapsible bicycles, frogm en suits, and rubbe r m ats for crossing electrically-charged barbed-wire fences. 115"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"The Russians were returned to their hom eland for a variety of reasons: to gather intelligence about m ilitary a nd techn ological ins tallations ; co mmit assassinations ; obtain curren t sam ples of id entification docum ents; as sist W estern agents to es cape; eng age in sabotage, for which they were well trained (m ethods of derailing trains and wrecking bridges, actions against arm s factories and power plants, etc. ); o r instigate armed political struggle against Communist rule by linking up with resistance movem ents—a wholly unre alistic goa l given the f eeble sta te of such m ove ments, but one which some NTS fanatics swore by. It will never be known just how m any m en the CIA infiltrated into the Soviet Union, not only by air but by border crossi ngs and by boat as well; many hundreds at least. As to their fate ... the Soviet Union published a book in 1961 called Caught In the Act (=CIA), in which were listed the nam es and other details of about two dozen inf iltrato rs the Russians claim ed to have captured, often alm ost i mmediately upon arriv al. Some were executed, others received prison sentences, one allegedly was an individual who had taken part in a m ass ex ecution of Jews in Germ an- occupied So viet territory. The book assert s that there were m any more ca ught who were not listed. This may have been a self -serving state ment, but it was a relatively sim ple m atter f or the Russians to inf iltra te the ém igrés' ranks in W estern Europe and le arn the entire operation. The CIA, to be sure, was not naive about this practice. The Agency went so far as to torture suspected defectors in Muni ch—using such esoteric m ethods as applying turpentine to a m an's t esticles or sealing som eone in a room and playing Indonesian music at dea fening levels until h e cr acked. 11 The Russians further claim ed that som e of those sm uggled in were f urnished with special radio beaco ns to guide planes where to land oth er agents, an d which could also be used to direct US bom bers in the even t of war. Som e of the ém igrés m ade it back to W estern Eu rope with th eir b its and pieces of infor mation, or after attem pting to catty out som e other assignm ent. Others, provided with a complete se t of necessary docum ents, were instru cted to integ rate th em selves back into Soviet society and becom e \"agent s in place\". S till others, caught up in the em otions of being \"hom e\", turned them selves in—once again, \"the hum an factor\", which no amount of training or ind octrination can necessarily circum vent. 12 No Am erican operation agains t the Soviet Union would be com plete without its propaganda side: bringing the gos pel to the h eath en, in a m yriad of ways that displayed the cr eativity of the CIA and its team of ém igrés. Novel m echanism s were developed to enable airplanes and balloons to drop anti-Communist literature over the S oviet Union. W hen the wind was right, countless leaflets and pam phlets were scattered across the land; or q uantities of litera ture w ere floated downstream in waterproof packages. Soviet citizens com ing to the W est were m et at every turn by NTS people handing out their newspapers and m agazines in Russian and Ukrainia n. To f acilitate contact, NTS at tim es engaged in black m arket operations and opened sm all shops which catered to Russians at cheap prices. From North Africa to Scan dinavia, the CI A network confronted Soviet seam en, tourists, o fficials, athletes, even Soviet soldiers in East Germ any, to present them with the Truth as seen by the \"Free W orld\", as well as to pry inform ation from them, to induce them to defect, or to re cruit them as spies. Hotel room s were searched, phones tapped, bribes o ffered, or blackm ail threatened in attempts to reach these ends. Actions were also undertaken to entrap or provoke Soviet diplom atic personnel so as to cause their expulsion and/or emba rrass the Soviet Union. 15 116"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"The propaganda offensive led the US governm ent into the book publishing business. U nder a variety of arrangem ents with Am erican and foreign publishers, distributors, literary agents and authors, the CIA and the United Sta tes Inf orm ation Agency (USIA) produced, subsidized or sponsored \"well over a thousand books\" by 1967 which were deem ed to serve a propaganda need. 14 Many of the books were sold in the United Stares as w ell as abroad. None bore any i ndication of US governm ent involvem ent. Of som e, said the USIA, \" We cont rol the things from the very idea down to the f inal edited m anuscrip t.\" 15 Som e books were published, and at tim es written, only after the USIA or the CIA agreed to purchase a large number of c opies.

W ith th e exception of the last, the stations were ostensibly private organizations financed by \"gif ts\" f rom Americ an corporations, nickel- and-dim e donations from the Am erican public , and other private sources. In actuality, the CIA covertly funded alm ost all of th e costs until 1971 ; exposure of the Agency' s role in 1967 (although it had been widely assum ed long before then) led to Congress eventually institu ting op en governmental finan cing of the stations. The stations served the purpos e of filling in so me of the gaps and correcting the falsehoods of the Communist m edia, but coul d not escape presenti ng a picture of the world, both East and W est, shot through with their own om issions and distortions. Their mission in life was to emphasize w hatever could m ake the Comm unist regim es look bad. \"To many in the CIA,\" wrote Victo r M arche tti, form er senior of ficial of the Agency, \"the prim ary value of the radios wa s to sow discontent in Eastern Europe and, in the process, to weaken the comm unist governm ents\". 18 Many of the Russians who worked for the various stations, which broadcast at length about freedom , de mocracy and other human itarian concerns, were later identified by the US J ustic e Depar tment as m embers of Hitle r's notorio us Einsatzgruppen, which rounded up and killed num erous jews in the S oviet Union.

Germ an war crim inals as well were em ployed by the CIA in a variety of anti-Soviet operations. 19 By every account, the sundry program s to collect strategic infor mation about the Soviet Union, particularly via infiltration into the country and encountering Soviet nationals in the W est, were a singular flop. The infor mation reported was usually trivial, spotty, garb led, or out- of-date. W orse, it was of ten em bellished, if not out-and- out fabricated. Many post-war ém igrés in W estern Europe m ade their living in the inform ation business. It was their most sal eable commodity. From a real or fictitious meeting with a Soviet citizen they w ould prep are a report which was often just ordinary facts with a bit of political color added on. At tim es, as m any as four versions of the report would be produced, differi ng in style and quantity of \"facts\"; written by four dif ferent pe ople, the r eports would then be sold separately to US, British, French and West Germ an intelligence agencies.

N TS looked good, and the files grew thick. 20 The CIA' s Russian files in W ashingt on, m eanwhile, approached m ountainous proportions with the data acquired from openi ng m ail between the Soviet Union and the United States, a practice begun in the earl y 1950s and continued at least into the 1970s. 21 (Said a Post Office counsel in 1979: \"I f there was no national security mail cover program , the FBI m ight be inhibited in finding out if a na tion was planning war against us.\") 22 Form er CIA officer Harry Rositzk e, who was closely invo lved with anti-Soviet opera tions a fter the war, late r wrote that the prim ary task of the ém igrés inf iltrated into the Soviet Union during the early years—and the sam e could probably be said of the spy-plane s—was to pr ovide \"ea rly warning\" o f a Soviet m ilitary of fensive ag ain st the West, an invasion which, in the m inds of cold-warriors in the Am erican governm ent, appeared perpetually \"imminent\". This a pprehension was reminiscent of the alarms sounded following the Russian Revolution (s ee Introduction to the Origin al Edition ) and sim ilarly f lourished desp ite the fact o f a Russia recently devas tated by a major war and hardly in a position to undertake a m ilita ry operation of any such m agnitude. Nevertheless, wrote R ositzke, \"It was offici ally estim ated tha t Sov iet f orces were capable of reaching the Englis h Channel in a m atter of week s. ... It was an axiom in Washington that Stalin was plotting war. When would it com e?\" He pointed out , however, th at \"The m ere exis tence of radio-equipped agents on Soviet terrain with no early warnings to report had som e cautiona ry value in te mpering the war scare am ong the m ilitary estim ators a t the heigh t of the Cold W ar.\" 23 A secret report of the National S ecuri ty Resources Board of January 1951 warned: \"A s things are now going, by 1953 if not 1952, the Soviet aggressors will assum e complete con trol of the world situa tion. \" 24 Rositzke, although a co mmitted anti-Comm unist, recogn ized the unreality of such thinking.

A W hite House m emorandum , prepared af ter the 1953 election, reported that \"Neither the Moscow war stick nor the Am erican econom ic carrot was being visibly brandished overthe voters in this election.\" 1 Covert funding was the name of the gam e. Victor Marchetti, form er executive assis tant to the Deputy Director of the CIA, has revealed th at in the 195 0s the Agen cy \"spen t so me $20 to $30 m illion a year, o r m aybe more, to finance its program s in Italy.\" Expenditures in the 1960s, he added, cam e to about $10 million annually. 2 The CIA itself has adm itted that between 1948 and 1968, it paid a total of $65,150,000 to the Christian Dem ocrats and other pa rties, to labor groups, and to a wide variety of other organizations in Italy. 3 It also spent an undisclosed am ount in support of magazines and book publishers and other m eans of news and opinion m anipulation, such as planting news item s in non-Am erican m edia around the world which cast unfavorable light upon communis m, then arrangi ng for these stories to be reprinted in friendly Italian publications. 4 It is not known when, if ever, the CIA ended its practice of fundi ng anti- Communist groups in Italy. Internal Agency docum ents of 1972 reveal contributions of som e $10 m illion to political patties, aff iliated organ izations, and 2t indiv idual candida tes in the p arliamentar y elections of that year. 5 At le ast $6 m illio n was pass ed to political leaders for the June 1976 elections. 6 And in the 19 80s, CIA Directo r W illiam Casey arran ged f or Saudi Arabia to pay $2 m illion to prev ent the Communists f rom achiev ing electoral gains in Italy. 7 Moreover, the largest oil com pany in the United States, Exx on Corp., ad mitted that between 1963 and 1972 it had m ade polit ical contributions to the Christian De mocrats and several o ther Italian political parties to taling $46 million to $49 m illion. Mobil Oil Corp. also contributed to the Ital ian electo ral process to the tune of an average $500,000 a year from 1970 throug h 1973.

Inasm uch as politic al advertising is not allowed on Italian television, the US Ambassador to Switzerland, Nathaniel Da vis, arranged for the purchase of large blocks of tim e on Monte Carlo TV to pr esen t a daily \"n ews\" commentary by the editorial staff of the Milan newspaper Il Giornale Nuovo, which was clo sely as sociated with the CIA. It was this newspaper that , in May 1981, set in m otion chat particular piece of international d isinform ation known as \"The KGB Plot to Kill the Pope\". Another Italian newspaper, the Da ily America n of Rom e, for decades the country' s leading English-language paper, was for a long period in the 1950s to the ' 70s partly owned and/or m anaged by the CIA. \" We 'had' at least one newspaper in every foreign cap ital at auy given tim e,\" the CIA ad mitted in 1977, referr ing to papers owned outrigh t or heavily subs idized, or in filtra ted suf ficien tly to h ave stor ies printed which were useful to the Agency or suppress those it found detrim ental. 10 Am bassador Davis also arranged f or news item s which had been placed in various new spapers by the Agency to be r ead on Monte Carlo TV and Swiss TV, both of which were received in Italy. The progr am s were produced in Milan by Franklin J. Tonnini of the US Diplom atic Corps, and Michael Ledeen, a reporter w ith // Giornal e Nuovo. 11 (Ledeen, an Am erican, was later a consu ltan t to th e Reagan adm inistration and a senior fellow at the co nserva tive think-tank of Georgetown University in W ashington, the Center for Strategic a nd International Studies.) The relen tless f ight against the Ita lian Co mmunist Party took som e novel twists. One, in the 1950s, was the brainchild of Am erican Am bassador Clare Booth Luce. The celebrated Ms. Luce (playwright and wife of Time magazine publisher Henry Luce) decided to m ake it known that no US Depa rtm ent of De fense procurem ent contracts would be awarded to Italian firm s whose em ployees had voted to be represented by the Communist-controlled labor union. In the case of Fiat, th is had dram atic results: T he Communist union' s share of the vote pr om ptly fe ll from 60 to 38 percent. 12 Then there was the case of Cardina l Giovanni Battista Montini, another beneficiary of CIA largesse. The paym ents m ade to him reveal som ething of the Agency' s mechanis tic thinking abo ut why pe ople becom e radicals. It seem s that the good Cardinal was prom oting orphanages in Italy during the 1950s and 1960s and, says Victor Marchetti, \"The thinking was that if such institutions were adequately supported, many young people would be able to live well there and so would not one day fall into Communist hands.\" 13 The Cardinal, as a Monsignor , had been involved with the Vatican' s operation to smuggle Nazis to fr eedom after W orld W ar II. He had a long history of association with W estern governm ents and their intelligence agencies.

In his account of that period he justifies this program on the grounds of supporting \"dem ocracy\" or \"center dem ocracy \" and preventing Italy from becom ing a Soviet satellite. Colby percei ved all virtue and truth to be bunched closely around the center of th e political s pectrum , and the Italian Communist Party to be an ex trem ist organiz ation comm itted to abolishin g dem ocracy and creating a society m odeled after the (worst?) excesses of Stalinist Russia.

Colby, after all, took pains to point out his libe ral leaning s. These were m en unable to view the Italian Com munist Party in its indigenous po litical context, but only as a \"national security\" thr eat to the United Sta tes and NATO. Yet, all those years, the party was proceed ing along a path revisionist enough to make Lenin tu rn in his grave if he were in one. The path was m arked by billboards proclaim ing the \"dem ocratic advance to socialism \" and the \"national ro ad to socialism \", the abandonm ent of \"the dictatorship of the proletariat\" and the denunciatio n of th e Soviet inv asio n of Czechoslovakia. The party pushed its \"nation al\" role as responsible opposition, p articipated in \"the drive for productivity \", affirm ed i ts support for a m ultiparty system and for\" Italy rem aining in the Common Market and in NATO, and was se cond to none in its condemnation of any for m of terrorism . On m any occasions, it was the p rincip al po litical force in city governm ents including Rom e, Florence and Ve nice, without any noticeable return to barbarism , and was a de facto participan t in the runn ing of the I talian s tate.

Vietnam 1950-1973 The hearts and minds circus Contrary to repeated statem ents by Wash ington officials during the 1960s that the United S tate s did not inte rvene in Viet nam until, and only because, \"North Vie tnam invaded South Vietnam \", the US was deeply and continually involved in that woeful (and from the year 1950 onwards. The initia l, fatef ul s tep was the decis ion to m ake larg e-sca le ship ments of military equ ipm ent (tan ks, tr anspor t planes, etc. ) to the F rench in Vie tnam in the spr ing and summ er of 1950. In April, S ecretary of State Dean Acheson had told French officials that the United St ates governm ent was set agains t France negotiating with their Northern-b ased Vietnam ese foes, the Vietm inh 1 (also spelled Viet Minh or Viet-Minh: the nam e was short for League for the In dependence of Vietnam , a broadly-based nationalist move ment led by Communists). W ashington was not particularly sym pathetic to France' s endeavor to regain control of its colony of 100 years and had vacillated o n the issu e, but th e rise to pow er of the Comm unists in China the prev ious autum n had tipped the scale in f avor of supporting the French. To the Truma n adm inistration, the prospect of another Commu nist governm ent in Asia was intolerable. There was a secondary consideration as well at the tim e: the need to persuade a reluctant F rance to sup port Am erican plans to include Germ any in West European defense organizations. During W orld W ar II, the Japanese had di splaced the French. Upon the defeat of Japan, the Vietm inh took power in the North, while the British occupied the South, but soon turned it back to the French. Said French G eneral Jean Leclerc in S eptem ber 1945: \"I didn' t com e back to Indochina to gi ve Indochina back to the Indochinese.\" 2 Subsequently, the French em phasized that they were fig hting for th e \"free world\" agains t com munism , a claim m ade in no sm all pa rt to pe rsuade the U nited States to incre ase its aid to them . Am erican bom bers, m ilitary advisers and technicians by the hundreds were to follow the f irst aid sh ipments, and over the nex t few years direc t Am erican m ilitar y aid to the French war effort ran to about a bil lion dollars a year. By 1954, the authorized aid had reached the sum of $1.4 billion and consti tuted 78 percent of the French budget for the war. 3 The extensive written histor y of the Am erican role in Indochina produced by the Defense Departm ent, later to be known as \"The Pentagon Papers\", concluded that the decision to provide aid to Fr ance \"d irectly invo lved\" the United States in Vietnam and \"set\" the cou rse for future Am erican policy. 4 There had been another path open. In 1945 and 1946, Vietminh leader Ho Chi Minh had written a t lea st eigh t le tters to President Trum an and the State Departm ent asking for Am erica' s help in winning Vietna mese independence from the French. He wrote that world peace was being endangered b y French efforts to recon quer Indoch ina and he requested that the \"four powers\" (US, USSR, China, and Great B ritain) interv ene in order to m ediate a fair settlem ent and br ing the Indochinese issue before the United Nations. 5 (This was a rem arkable repeat of history. In 1919, following the First W orld War, Ho Chi Minh had appealed to US Secretary of State Robert Lansing for Am erica' s help in achieving basic civi l liberties and an im provem ent in the living conditions for the colonial subjects of French I ndochina. This plea, too, was ignored.) 6 122"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Despite the f act that Ho Chi Minh and hi s followers had worked closely with the Am erican OSS (the forerunner of the CIA) during the recently ended w orld war, w hile the French authorities in I ndochina had collabor ated with the Japa nese, the United States failed to answer any of the letters, did not reveal that it had received them , and eventually sided with the Fr ench. In 1950, part of the public ly stated rationale for the Am erican position was that Ho Chi Minh was not really a \"genuine nationalist\" but rather a tool of \"internationa l communism \", a conclusion th at could be re ached only by deliberately ignoring the totali ty of his life' s work. He and the Vietm inh had, in fact, been long -tim e adm irers of the United States . H o trusted the US m ore than he did the Soviet Union and reportedly had a picture of George W ashington and a copy of the Am erican Declaration of Independence on his desk. According to a former OSS officer, Ho sought his advice on fra ming the Vietm inh 's own declaration of independence. The actual declaration of 1945 begins with the fa miliar \"All m en are created equal. They are endowed by their Creator with certain inalie nable rights, among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\" 7 But it was the French who were to r eceive A merica' s blessing. Ho C hi Minh was, after all, som e kind of comm uni st. The United States viewed the French strugg le in Vietn am and their own concurrent intervention in Korea as two links in the chain aim ed at \"containing\" China. Washington was adam antly opposed to the Fr ench negotiating an end to the war which would leave the Vietm inh in power, in the north ern part of the country, and, at the same tim e, free the Chinese to concentrate exclus ively on their K orean border. In 1952, the US exerted strong pressure upon France not to pursue peace feel ers extended by the Vietm inh, and a French delegation, scheduled to m eet with Vietm inh negotiators in Bur ma, was hastily recalled to Paris. Bernard Fall, the renowned French sc holar on Indochina, believed that the canceled negotiations \"could perh aps have bro ught about a cease-fire on a far more acceptable b asis\" for th e French \"tha n the one obtained two years late r in the shadow of crushing m ilitary defeat\". 8 Subsequently, to keep the French fr om negotiating with the Vietm inh, the United States used the threat of a cessati on of their subs tan tial econom ic and m ilitary aid. 9 (This prom pted a French newspaper to comment that \"the Indochina W ar has becom e France' s num ber one dollar-earning export\".) 10 In Nove mber 1953, the om nipresent CIA airline, CAT, hel ped the French air force airlift 16,000 m en into a fort ified base the French had es tablished in a valley in the North called Dien Bien Phu. When the garrison was later surrounded and cut off by the Vietm inh, CAT pilots, flying US Air Force C-119s, often through anti-aircraft fire, delive red su pplies to the beleague red French f orces, in th is th eir W aterloo . 11 By 1954, the New York Times could report that \"The French Air Force is now alm ost entirely equipp ed with A merican planes.\" 12 The United S tates had also constructed a number of airfields, ports and highways in Indochina to facilitate the war effort, som e of which Am erican forces were to m ake use of in the ir late r wars in th at area. In April 19 54, when a French m ilitary de feat was apparen t and negotiations at Geneva were scheduled, the National Security Council urged President E isenhower \"to inform Paris that F rench acquiescen ce in a Communist take-over of Indochina would bear on its status as one of the Big Th ree\" and that \"U.S. aid to France would autom atically cease\". 13 A Council paper recomm ended that \"It be U.S. policy to accept nothing short of a m ilitary victory in Indo-China\" and th at the \"U.S. actively oppose any negotiated 123"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"settlem ents in Indo-China at Geneva\". The C ouncil stated further that, if necessary, the US should consider continuing the war without French participation. 14 The Eisenhower adm inistration had for som e tim e very seri ously considered comm itting Am erican c ombat troop s to Vietna m. Apparently this m ove was not made only because of uncertainty abou t congressi onal approval and the refusal of other countries to send even a token force, as they had done in Korea, to rem ove t he appearan ce of a purely Am erican o peration. 15 \"We are con fronted by an unfortun ate fact,\" lam ented Secretary of State John Fo ster Dulles at a 1954 Cabinet m eeting. \"Most of the countries of the world do not share our view that Communi st control of any governm ent anywhere is in itself a danger and a threat.\" 16 In May, the Chairm an of the Joint C hief s of Staff, Adm iral Arthur Radford, sent a m emorandum to Defense Secretary Char les W ilson on \"Studies W ith Respect to Possible U.S. Actions Regarding Indochina\" which stated that \"The e mploym ent of atom ic weapons is co ntem plated in the even t that su ch course ap pears m ilitarily advantageous.\" 17 (General Charles W illoughby, MacArthur 's director of intelligence, put it a bit more poetically when he advocated the use of atom ic bom bs \"to create a belt of scorched earth acros s th e avenues of comm uni sm to block the Asiatic hordes\".) 18 By this tim e, two Am erican aircraft car riers equipped with atom ic weapons had been ordered into the G ulf of Tonki n, in the North of Vietnam , 19 and Dulles is, in f act, reported to have offered his F rench counterpart, Ge orges Bidault, atom ic bom bs to save Dien Bien P hu. Bidault was oblig ed to point out to Dulles th at the use of atom ic bombs in a war of such close arm ed conflict would destroy the F rench troops as well as the Vietm inh. 20 Dulles regularly denounced Ch ina, in the ultra-sanc tim onious m anner he was known for, for assisting the Vietm inh, as if the Chinese had no caus e or right to be alarm ed about an an ti-comm unist m ilitary cru sade taking place scant m iles from their border. As the Geneva conference appro ached, a CIA propaganda team in Singa pore began to dissem inate fabricated news item s to advance th e idea th at \"the Chinese were giving full arm ed support to the Viet-Minh\" a nd to \"identify\" the Viet-Minh \"with the world Communist m ovem ent\". The CIA believed that such stories would strengthen the non-Comm unist side at the Geneva talks. 21 Joseph Burkholder Sm ith was a CIA officer in Singapore. His \"press asset\" was one Li Huan Li, an experien ced lo cal journ alist. It is ins tructive to no te the m ethod em ployed in the creation and dissem ination of one such news report abou t th e Chines e. After Sm ith and Li had m ade up their stor y, Li attended the regular press conference held by the British High Comm issioner in Singapore, Malcolm MacDonald. At the conference, Li m entioned the rep ort a nd asked the Commissioner if he had any comment. As expected, MacDonald had nothing to say about it one way or the other. The result was the f ollo wing news item : MORE CHINESE SUP PLIES AND TROOPS SP OTTE D E N ROUTE T O HAIPHONG.

The Geneva conference, on 20 J uly 1954, put a for mal end to the war i n Vietnam . The United States was alone in re fusing to sign the Final Declaration, purely because it was peeved at the negotia ted settlem ent, which precluded any further m ilita ry effort to defeat the Vietm inh. There had been ample indication of Am erican displeasure with the whole process well before the end of the conference. Two weeks earlier, for exam ple, President Eisenhower had declared at a news conference: \"I will not be a party to any treaty that m akes anybody a slave; now that is all there is to it.\" 23 But the US did issue a \"unilater al dec laration\" in which it agre ed to \"refrain from the threat or the use of force to disturb\" the accords. 24 The letter and the spirit of the ceas efir e ag reem ent and th e Final Declaration looked forward to a Vietnam free from any m ilitary p resen ce other than Vietnam ese or French, and free from any aggressive opera tion s. However, while the conference was still in se ssion in Jun e, the Un ited States began assem bling a pa ram ilitary team in side Vietnam .

The Geneva Accords specified that el ections under interna tional supervision were to be held in July 1956, with \"consulta tions\" to prepare for th em to be held \"from 20 July 1955 onwards\". The United States, in its unilateral declaration, had reiterated this pledg e: \"In the cas e of nations now divide d against th eir will, we shall continu e to seek to achieve unity through free elections supervised by the United Nations to insure that they are conducted f airly.\" The elections were never held. On 16 July 1955, four days before the consultations were scheduled to begin, Pr esident Ngo Dinh Die m of South Vietna m issued a s tatem ent that m ade it cleat that he had no intentio n of engaging in the consultation s, m uch less the e lection s. 28 Three days later, N orth Vietnam sent Diem a for mal note calling for the talks, but Diem rem ained fir m in his position. Efforts by France and Great Britain to persuad e Diem to begin the talk s were to no avail. The reason for Diem's intransigen ce is well known. He, like P resident Eisenhower and John Foster Dulles, knew that Ho Chi Minh would be a certain winner of any national e lectio ns. A CIA Nationa l I ntelligenc e Estim ate in the au tumn concluded that the Diem regim e (which Lansdale him self called \"fascistic\") 29 \"almost certainly w ould not be able to defeat the communists in country-w ide elections.\" 50 Later, E isen hower was to write in h is m emo irs: \"I have never talked or corresponded with a person knowledgeable in Indochinese a ffairs who did not agree that had elections been held as of the ti me of the fighti ng, possibly 80 percent of the population would have voted for the Communist Ho Chi Minh as their lead er rather than Chief of State Bao Dai.\" 31 (The la tter was Diem' s predece ssor. ) The study of the Pentagon papers cited \"State Departm ent cables and National Security Council m emorandum s indicating that the Eisenhower Adm inistration wished to postpone the elections as long as possi ble and communicated its f eelings to Mr. Diem .\" 32 This was support that Diem could not have done without, for, as the P entagon historians point out: \"Without the threat of U.S. interven tion, South Vietnam could not have refused to even discuss the elec tions called for in 1956 under the Geneva settlem ent without being imm ediat ely overrun by the Vietm inh arm ies.\" 33 The public statem ents of Diem and Dulle s spoke only of their concern that the elections w ould not be \"free\", which served to obscure the f act that Ho Chi Minh did not need to resort to fraud in order to win, as well as igno ring the ann ouncem ents of both the United Nations and th e International Control Comm ission (set up in Vietnam by the Geneva Accords) that they we re ready to superv ise the elections. In any even t, Diem' s comm itment to free elections m ay be surm ised from a referendum he held in October 1955 in Sout h Vietnam to invest his regim e with a sem blance of legality, in which he received 98.2 percen t of the vote. Life magazine later reported that Die m's American advisers had told him that a 60 percent margin would be quite sufficient and would look better, \"but Diem insisted on 98 percent\". 34 With the elections canceled, th e nati on still divided, and Diem with his \"m andate\" free to continue his heavy, tyranni cal rule, the turn to violence in South Vietnam becam e inevitable. As if in knowledge of a nd preparation for this, the United States s ent 350 additional m ilitary m en to Saigon in May 1956, an \"exam ple of the U.S. ignoring\" the Geneva Accords, stated the Pentagon study. 35 Shortly af terwards, Dulles conf ided to a 126"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"colleague: \"W e have a clean base there now, without a tain t of colonialism.

If W ashington had been willin g t o accept such change— w hich th ey have always routinely and disparaging ly dism issed as \"socialist\"—there would have been no need to cancel the elections or to support Diem, no need for intervention in the first place. There was, cons equently, no way the United States could avoid being seen by the peopl e o f Vietnam as other than the n ewest im perialis t occupie rs, f ollowing in the f ootst eps of first th e Chinese, then the French, then the Jap anese, th en the French again.

To the m en who walked the corridors of power in W ashington, to the military men in the field, Indochina—nay, southeas t Asia—was a single, large battlefield. Troops of South Vietnam were used in La os and Cam bodi a. Troops of Thailand were used in Laos, Ca mbodia and South Vietnam . Thailand and the Philipp ines were used as bases from which to bomb the three countries of Indochina. Military officers in Sout h Vietnam, Thailand, and Taiwan were trained at Am erican schools in the Philipp ines. CIA-supported forces carried out incursions and invasions into China from Laos, Bur ma and Taiwan. When there was a (m uch-publicized] paus e in the bom bing of North Vietnam , more Am erican planes were thus availab le to increase the bom bing of Laos. And s o it went. From 1955 to 1959, Michigan State University, under a US governm ent contract, con ducted a covert police traini ng program for the South Vietnam ese. W ith the full knowledge of c ertain MSU officials, five CIA operatives were concealed in the staff of the program and carried on the uni versity' s payroll as its em ployees. By the term s of a 1957 law, drawn up by the MSU gr oup, every Vietnam ese 15 years and older was required to register with the govern ment and carry ID cards. Anyone caught without the proper identific ation was considered as a National Liberation Front (Vietcong) suspect and subject to im prisonm ent or worse.

The United States app eared to retreat in th e face of this unorthodox public diplom acy. The State Departm ent sent a coupl e of rather conciliatory m essages which nullified a threatened cu t-off of certain ec onom ic aid and in cluded this rem arkable piece of altruism : \"The only aim of Am erican pol icy to Cam bodi a is to help her strengthen and defend her independence.\" T wo days before the national congress convened, Thailand and South Vietnam opened their front iers. The lo cal d ispute s which th e two countries had cited as the reasons for the blockade had not been resolved at all. 2 The m easures taken against Cam bodia we re counter-productive. Not only did Sihanouk continue to attack SEATO, but he es tablished relations w ith the Soviet Union and Poland and accepted aid from China. He praised th e latter lav ishly f or tre ating Ca mbodia as an equal and for providing aid without all the strings which, he felt, came attached to Am erican aid. 3 Such behavior should not obscure the fact that Sihanouk was as genuine a neutralist as one could be in such a highly pol arized region of the world in the m idst of the cold w ar. He did not shy away fr om denouncing China, North Vietnam or communis m on a number of occasions when he felt that Cam bodia' s security or neutrality was being threatened. \"I foresee pe rfectly well,\" he said at one tim e, \"the collapse of an independent and neutral Cambodia after the com plete trium ph of Communism in Laos and South Vietnam .'\" 1 In May 1957, a National Security Council (NSC| paper acknowledged that \"the United States has been unable to influence Ca mbodia in the direction of a stable [i.e., pro-W estern] governm ent and non-invol vem ent in the communist bloc.\" 5 The following year, five battalions of Saigon troops, suppor ted by aircraft, crossed the Ca mbodian border again, penetrat ed to a depth of alm ost 10 m iles and began putting up new boundary m arkers.

It was perh aps without preceden t that a coun try receiving Am erican aid volun tarily repudiated it. But Sihanouk held strong feeli ngs on the subject.

However, Sihanouk then went on the radio and proceeded to denounce th e bom bings. 20 Opportunist that he often revealed him self to be, Sihanouk was nonetheless truly caught between the devil and the deep blue sea, and by the late 1960s his predicam ent had com pelled him to resume Am erican aid and re -estab lish d iplom atic relations with the Uni ted St ates. Despite all the im pulsiveness of his personality and policies, Sihanouk's neutralist high-wire balancing act did successfully shield his country from the worst of the devastation that was sweeping through th e land and people of Vietnam and Laos. Ca mbodia had its own Communist insurgen ts, the Khm er Rouge, who surely would have unleashed a full-scale civ il war if f aced with a Cambodian governm ent nestled comf ortably in the Am erican cam p. This is precisely what later cam e to pass following the overthro w of Sihanouk and his replacem ent by Lon Nol who was closely tied to the Uni ted St ates. In March 1969, the situation began to change dram atically. Under the new Am erican presiden t, Richard Nixo n, and National Secur ity Af fairs adviser He nry Kissinger, the isolated and lim ited attacks across the Ca mbodian border became sustained, large-scale B-52 bom bings—\"carpet bom bings\", in the euphem istic language so dear to th e hear ts of m ilitary m en. Over the next 14 m onths, no less than 3,630 B-52 bom bing raids were flown over Cam bodia. 21 To escape the onslaught, the Vi etnam ese Comm unists m oved their 136"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"bases further inside the country. T he B-52s of course followed, with a concom itant increase in civilian casualties. The Nixon adm inistration artfully played dow n the nature and extent of these bom bings, going so far as to falsify m ilitary records, and was larg ely successful in keeping it all a secret from the Am erican public, the press and Congress. 22 Not until 1973, in the m idst of the Watergate revelati ons, did a fuller story begin to em erge. It was f requently a rgued that the Un ited States had ev ery right to attack Ca mbodia because of its use as a sanctuary by Am erica' s foes in Vietn am.

The n ext day, the Cambodian army called in an Am erican spotter plane and S outh Vietnam ese artillery during a sweep of a Vietcong sanctuary by a batt alion of Cambodian troops inside Cambodia. The New York Times declared that \"The battle ap peared to b e the most determ ined Cam bodian ef fort y et to drive the Vietcong out of border areas.\" 32 The Great Cam bodian W ar had begun. It was to persist for five terrible years. The enem y confronting the United S tates and its Saigon and Phnom Penh allies was now not sim ply the North Vietna mese and the Vietcong. The Cam bodian Communists—the Khmer Rouge—under the leader ship of Pol Pot, had entered the conflict, as had sundry Ca mbodi an supporters of Prince Sihanouk. On 30 April 1970, the first full-scale Am erican invasion of the new war was launched. It produced a vast ou tcry of protest in the Unit ed States, rocking university cam puses from coast to coast. Perh aps the most ex trao rdin ary reaction was the an gry resignations of four men fr om Henry Kissinger' s Nationa l Security C ouncil staff, including Roger Morris. (Kissinger labeled th e resignation s as \"th e co wardice of the Eastern esta blishm ent\".) 33 By the end of May, scores of villages had been reduced to rubble and ashes by US air power; the long train of Ca mbodi an refugees had begun their m arch. Three years and m ore than a hundred thous and tons of bombs later, 27 January 1973 to be precise, an agreem ent was signed in Paris pu tting an end to a decad e of Am erican warfare in Vietnam . The bom bing of Cam bodia, however, continued. Prior to the Paris agreem ent, the offi cial position of the Nixon adm inistration, repeatedly asserted, was that the sole pur pose of bom bing Cam bodia was to protect Am erican lives in Vietn am. Yet now, th e US not only did not cease the bom bing, it increased it, in a last desperate attem pt to keep the Khm er Rouge from com ing to power. During March, April and May, the t onnage of bombs unloosed over Cam bodia was m ore than double that of the entire prev ious year. The society' s traditional economy had vanished. The old Cam bodia wa s being destroyed forever. Under increasing pressure from Congr ess, the Nixon adm inistration finally ended the b ombing in August. More than two m illion Cambodians had been m ade hom eless.

The ground war had been carried out becau se the Pathet Lao were led by people whom the State Department categorized as \"com munist\", no more, no less. The Pathet Lao (re)tu rned to warfare because of their experiences in \"working within th e s ystem \". In 1957 the Pathet Lao (\"Lao nation\") held two m inisterial posts in the coalition \"governm ent of national union\".

The left was now altogether exclud ed from the government, and the elections scheduled for Decem ber were canceled. 8 If this wasn' t enough to disenchant th e Pathet Lao or anyone else with the Laotian political process, there was, in the late 1950s and eariy 1960s , the spectacle of a continuous parade of coups and counter-c oups, of m en ove rthrown winding up in the new governm ent, and r egim es headed by m en w ho had sided with the French in their war against Indochinese independence, while the Pathet Lao had fought against the colonia lists. 9 There were as well governm ent-rigged elections, with the CIA stuffing ballot boxes; 10 different regim es-cum -warlords gove rning simultaneously from different \"capitals\", their arm ies fighting each other, switching allies and enem ies when it suited them ; hundreds of m illions of US dollars pouring into a tiny kingdom which was 99 percen t agricultu ral, with an econo my ba sed more on barter th an money, the result being \"unim aginable bribery, graft, currency m anipulation and waste\". 11 The CIA and the State Departm ent alone could take credit for engineering coups, throu gh force, bribery or other pressure s, at least once in each of the years 195 8, 1959 and 1960, if not in others. 12 \"By m erely withholding the m onthly paym ent to the troops,\" wrote Roger Hilsm an (whose career encom passed both agencies, perhaps covertly simultaneously), \"the United States could create the conditions f or toppling any Lao governm ent whose policies it opposed.

Souphanouvong insisted that neither he nor the P athet Lao were comm unist, but were ra ther \"ultra -na tion alist\". 14 Crucial to u nderstand ing his statements, of course, is the question of exactly what he meant by th e term \"communist\". This is not clear, but neither is it clear what the Stare Departm ent m eant when it referred to him as such. The Pathet L ao were the only sizable group in the country serious about social change, a characteristic which of course tends to induce W ashington officials to apply the communist label. In August 1960, Kong Le, a m ilitary offi cer with his o wn troop following, staged a coup and set up a neutralist gove rnm ent under S ouvanna Phoum a, rejecting Pathet Lao help. 15 But when this g overnm ent becam e a casualty of a CIA coup in Decem ber, Kong Le allied him self with the Pa thet Lao; later he tu rned to the United States for aid and fought against the Pathet Lao.

The CIA was over- extended, and, unlike the m otley band of Asians assem bled by the Agency, the soldiers of the Pathet Lao had som e idea of what th ey were fighting for. The Soviet Union, aware of what the United States w as doing in Laos, even if the Am erican public was not, was alarm ed by the establishm ent of a pro-Am erican governm ent in the country, and acceded to a co ld-w ar knee-reflex by se nding m ilitary supplies to the Pathet L ao, though nothing rem otely on the order of the US commit ment. 24 Beginning in the early 1960s, the North Vietnam ese were aiding them as well. Hanoi' s ove rriding interest in Laos was not necessarily th e creation of a Comm uni st state, but th e prev ention of a bellig erent govern ment on its border. In J anuary 1961, the New York Times reported that \"Many W estern diplom ats in Vientian e [capita l of La os] ... feel the Communists would have been c ontent to leave Laos alone provided she rem ained neutral and outside the Unit ed States sphere of influence.\" 25 Hanoi was c oncerned no t only by the Am erican p olitica l and m ilitary ope rations in Laos, but by the actions of US Special Fo rces team s which were entering North Vietnam to engage in espiona ge, sabotage, and assassination, 26 and by the bom bings of the country being carried out by the US Air Force 27 at a tim e when the war in So uth Vietnam wa s still but a shadow of what was to com e. Later, as the wars in Vietnam and Laos became intertwined, Laos form ed part of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, the p rincipal route by which Hanoi supplied its com rades in South Vietnam , and the North Vietnam ese fought to protect it as w ell as atta cking Am erican radar installations in L aos used to aid US bom bing of North Vietnam . The nature and extent of North Vietnam' s aid to the Pa thet Lao bef ore th is period is difficult to ascertain from W ester n sources, becau se such charges typically em anated from the Laotian governm ent or the State Departm ent.

On the East day of 1960, the Laotian governm ent announced to the w orld that seven battalions of North Vietnam ese troops had invaded the count ry. By all accounts, and by the u tter lack of evidence, this claim as well cannot be taken seriously. 30 And in 1962, reported B ernard Fall, the re nowned French scholar on Indochina: After a battle between governm ent forces and th e Pathet Lao, in spite of the fact that Col. Edwin Elder, th e Am erican commander in the area of the battle , imm ediately stated that there w as \"no evi dence t o show that C hinese or [Nor th] Vietn amese h ad particip ated in th e attack \", th e Lao tian s—and mu ch of t he U.S. press, and official W ashingt on with them —immediately cla imed that they we re again fac ed with a large -scale \"fo reign invasi on\" . 31 Shortly after Kennedy becam e president in Jan uary 1961, he m ade a sustain ed diplo matic ef fort to es tablish a c oaliti on governm ent in Laos , precisely what the Eisenhower adm inistration and the CIA had done their best to sabotage. Although he som etimes fell back on conventional cold-war rhetoric when speaking of Laos, one part of John F. Kennedy realized th e absurdity of fighting for the backward country, a land he considered not \"worthy of enga ging the attention of great powers\". 32 Soviet Prem ier Khrushchev, for his part, was reportedly \"bored \" with the question of Laos, and irritabl y asked Kennedy' s e missary why W ashington bothered so m uch about the country. 33 Eventually, in July 1962, a m ulti-na tion conference in Geneva signed an agreem ent for a coalition governm ent in Laos . But in the mountains and the plains of the country, this was no longer a viable op tion. The CIA had too much tim e, effort, material and em otion invested in its Secret Army; it was the best war the Agency had going anyw here; it was great adventure. And the Pathet Lao were m uch strong er n ow than a few years earlier. They were not about to buy such shopworn, suspect goods again, although everyone we nt through the m otions. Both sides regularly accused each other of violating the agreem ent, and not without justification. The Nort h Vietnam ese, for exam ple, di d not withdraw all of their troops from Laos, while the US left behind all m anner of m ilitary person nel, Am erican and Asian, who rem ained under AID and other civilian cover, but this was nonetheless a violation of the agreem ent. Moreover, Christopher Robbins, in his study of Air Am erica, has noted that US \"Military ad visers and CIA personnel m oved across the border into Thailand, w here they w ere flow n in every day [to Laos] like comm uters by Ait Am erica, whose entire helicopter operation was based in Udorn [Thailand].\" 34 Air Am erica, by the early 1970s, had no less than 4,000 em ploye es in Thailand. 35 Thus it was that the fighting dragged on, though only sporadically. In April 1964, the coalition governm ent, such as it was, was overthrown by the right wing, with the CIA' s man Phoum i Nosavan e merging as part of a rightist governm ent headed by the perennial survivor Souvanna Phoum a to give it a neutralist fig leaf. 36 The Pathet Lao were once again lef t out in the co ld.

During the night of 12-13 August 1959, a boat landed on the northern coast of Haiti with a reported 30 m en, Haitians and C uba ns and pe rha ps othe rs ab oard. The men had set sail from Cuba som e 50 m iles aw ay. Their purpose was to overthrow the tyrannical H aitian governm ent, a regim e w hose secret police, it was said, outnum bere d its arm y. In short order, the raidi ng party, equipped with hea vy weapons, captured a sm all arm y post and began to recruit and arm villa gers f or the cause. 2 The governm ent reported that about 200 pe rsons had joined them. 3 Haitian exile s in Ve nezuela, in an apparently coordinated effort, broadcast app eals to their coun trym en to aid the invaders. They set at 120 the number of m en who had la nded in Haiti, although this appears to be an exaggeration. 4 The initial reaction of th e Duvalier g overnm ent was one of panic, and the police began rounding up oppositio n sym pathizers. 5 It was at this poin t that the US m ilitary m ission, in Haiti to trai n Duv alier' s forces, stepp ed in. The Am ericans institu ted an air and sea reco nnaissa nce to locate the rebels. Haitian soldiers, accom panied by US Marines, were air lifted to the area and went into the f ield to d o battle with them . 6 Two other US Navy planes and a helicopter arrived from Puerto Rico. 7 According to their co mmander, Col- R obert Debs Hei nl, Jr., the Am erican Marines too k part in th e figh ting, which lasted until 22 August. 8 The outcom e was a com plete rout of the rebel forces.

Another r eport, ref erred to in th e Ne w York Times, stated that there were ten Haitians and two Venezuel ans amongst the 30 invaders. 9 The latter ratio is probably closer to the truth, for there was a considerab le num ber of Haitian exiles liv ing in Cuba, m any of whom had gained m ilita ry exper ience during th e recent Cuban revolu tion ; for obviou s reason s of intern ation al politics and fighting ince ntive, such m en were the m ost lik ely candidates to be part of an invasion of their hom eland. The Castro governm ent readily ad mitted th at the raiding party had com e from Cuba but denied that the gove rnm ent had known or approved of it. T his claim would seem rather suspect were it not for the fact that the Cuban coast guard had thwarted a sim ilar undertaking in A pril. 10 The f irst mem bers of the Am erica n m ilita ry m ission had arriv ed in Haiti in January, largely in response to another invasi on attem pt the previous Ju ly (orig inating probably in the Dom inican Re public). Regardless of all th e horror stories about the Haitian r egim e— such as the one Col. Heinl te lls of his 12-year-o ld son being arres ted when he wa s overheard expressing sym pathy for a group of hungry peasants he saw— Duvalier was W ashington' s m an. Aft er all was sa id and done, he coul d be counted upon to keep his Black nation, which was us ually accorded the honor of being Latin Am erica' s poorest, from turning Red. Heinl ha s recounted the instru ctions he received from a State Departm ent U nder Secretary in January: Colonel, th e mo st important way you ca n support our objectives in Haiti is to help keep Duvalier in power so he can serv e ou t his full term in o ffice, and may be a little long er than th at if ever yth ing works out .\" The Kennedy adm inistration, which cam e to power in January 1961, had little use for Papa Doc, and supported his overthrow as well as his possible assassination. According to the late r testim ony of CIA official W alter Elder b efore a Senate investigatin g comm ittee, the Agen cy f urnishe d arm s to Haitian d issidents s eeking to topple the dictator. E lder added that whil e the assassination of Duvalier was not contem plated, the arm s were provided \"to help [the diss idents] take what m easures were deem ed necessary to rep lace the gov ernm ent,\" and it was rea lized, he said, that Duvalier might be killed in the course of the overthrow. 12 But as Cuba increasing ly becam e the United S tates' bete noire, the CIA' s great obses sion, Washington' s policy ch anged. Haiti' s cooperation was needed for the success of US efforts to have Cuba expelled from the Organization of Am erican States in 1963. From that point on, Duvalier enjoyed the full diplom atic and econom ic support of the US. When t he Haitian leader died o n 12 April 1971, the American Am bassador Clin ton Knox was the only diplom at present at the midnight swearing-in of 19-year-old Jean- Claude \"Baby Doc\" Duvalier as the n ew Presid ent for Life, who was to receive th e same econom ic, political and m ilitary sup port as had \"Papa Doc\", with only the occasion al hiccup of a protest from W ashington when th e level of repression becam e difficult to ignore. 13 23.

On the beaches a nd in the jungles of Guatemala, Nicarag ua and Florida, the Bay of Pigs invasion was being rehearsed. On the 13th of the m onth, f ive days af ter Kennedy' s victory, Guatem alan m ilita ry personnel broke out in arm ed rebellion ag ainst the governm ent of General Miguel Ydigoras F uentes, seiz ing two m ilitary b ases and the p ort city of Puerto Ba rrios. Reports of the number of o fficers involved in the uprising vary from 45 to 120, the latter figure rep resenting alm ost half th e Guatem alan Arm y's officer corps. The officers commanded as m any as 3,000 troops, a significant percentage of the armed forces. Their goals, it later developed, were m ore nationalis tic than ideolo gical. The o fficers were fed up with the corruption in the Ydigotas regim e and in the army, and were particularly incensed about the use of th eir country by a foreign power as a springboard for an invasion of Cuba, some of the m being adm irers of Fidel Castro for his nationalist polic ies. On e of the diss ident of ficer s la ter ch aracterized the Am erican training base in Guatem ala as \"a shameful violation of our national sovereig nty. And why was it perm itted ? Because our governm ent is a puppet. \" 1 The rebellio n was crushed within a m atter of da ys, reportedly by the sole power of the Guatem alan Air Force. Som e years later, a different pi cture was to em erge. The rebels were a force to be reckoned with. The ease with which they had taken over the two garrisons and the real possibility of their m utiny spread ing to other b ases set alarm s ringing at th e CIA base, a large coffee plantation in a remote corner of southwestern Guatem ala, where th e Agency and the US Air Force were trainin g the arm y of Cuban exiles who were to launc h the attack upon th eir hom eland. The CIA feared, and rightly so, that a new regim e would send them , the Cubans, and the whole operation packing. In W ashington, President Eisenhower ordered US naval and air units to patrol the Caribbean coast and \"shoot if necessary\" to prevent any \"comm unist-led\" invasion of Guatem ala or Nicaragu a. 2 Eisenhower, like Ydigoras, sa w the hand of international communis m, particularly Cuba, behind the uprising, although no evidence of this wa s ever presented. 3 It was all m ost iro nic in light of th e fact that it was th e conspiracy of the two lead ers to overth row C uba th at was on e o f the reasons for the uprising; and that the US naval fleet ordered into action was deployed from Guantanam o Naval Base in Cuba, an Am erican m ilita ry installa tion pres ent in that cou ntry again st the vocif erous objections of the Cuban governm ent. In Guatem ala, m eanwhile, the CIA decide d upo n a solution to the dile mma that was both rem arkably simple and close at hand: Am erican and Cuban pilots took off from their training ground and bom bed a nd strafed rebel headquarters outside Guatem ala City, and bom bed the town a nd airfield of Puerto Barrios. Caught com pletely by surprise, and def enseless ag ainst this superior force, the rebels' insurrection collap sed. 4 Back at the coffee plantation, the C IA resum ed the function which had been so rudely interrupted, the preparation for the overthrow of the Cuban governm ent. No announcem ent about the bom bings was m ade in W ashington, nor did a report appear in th e Am erican press. The CIA actions were probably not widely known about in Guatem ala either, but it becam e public knowledge that President Ydig oras had ask ed W ashington for the naval and air supp ort, and h ad even ins tructed the Guatem alan Ambassador in W ashington to \"Get in touch immediately with [Ass istant S ecretary of State for Inter-A merican Affairs] Thom as Mann to coordinate your action.\" 5 Thus it was that the Guatemalan pres ide nt, needing afterward to distance him self a little from so m uch Yanqui protection, was 147"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"moved to state that cou ntries lik e Guatem ala are at a disad vantage because \"Cuba is a sate llite of powerf ul Russia\", bu t \"w e are no t a s atellite of th e United Sta tes.\" 6 The final irony was that som e of the di ssident officers w ho went into hiding becam e m ore radicalized by their experien ce. During their revolt they had spu rned offers of support from some of the peasan ts—though this would necessarily have been very lim ited in any cas e—because fighting fo r social ch ange was not at all what the officers had in m ind at the tim e. But as f ugitive s, thrown into greater c ontact with the peasants, th ey eventually cam e to be m ove d by the peasants' pressing need for land and for a way o ut of their wretched ex isten ce. 7 In 1962, several of th e officers were to em erge as leaders of a g uerrilla m ovem ent which incorporated \"Novem ber Thirteen \" as part of its nam e. In their opening statem ent, the guerrillas declared : Dem ocracy va nishe d from our c ount ry long ago. No people can live i n a co untry whe re t here is no dem ocracy. That is wh y the dem and for cha nges i s m ounting i n our c ountry . We can no lon ger carry on in th is way.

For if W ashingt on could casually do away with an elected governm ent in Guatem ala, as it had in 1954, it could be m oved by a guerrilla army only as rocks by waves or the m oon by howling wolves. 24. France/Algeria 1960s L'etat, c'est la CIA When John F. Kennedy assum ed office in January 1961, he was confronted with a CIA at the z enith of its power and c redib ilit y. In the Agency' s first 14 years, no formal congres sion al inv estigation of it had ta ken place, nor h ad any \"watchd og\" comm ittee been established; four investigations of th e CIA by independent task forces during this period had ensured that everythi ng r elating to th ings cover t remained just tha t; with the exception of the U-2 incident the year befo re, no page-one embarrassm ents, scandals, or known failures; what had received a m easur e of publicity—the coups in Guatem ala and Iran—were widely regarded as CIA succes s stories. White House denials and a com pliant m edia had kept the Agency' s misadventure in Indonesia in 1958 from the public scrutiny it deserved. It is probable that the C IA had m ore staff officers overseas, under offi cial and unoffi cial covers, th an the State Departm ent, and this in ad dition to its countless p aid agents. Often the CIA Chief of Station had b een in a particular country longer than the Am erican ambassador, had m ore money at hi s disposal, and exerted more influence. When it suited their purposes, Agency officers would com pletely bypass the am bassador and norm al protocol to deal direc tly with th e co untry' s head of state an d other high officials. The CIA had its own m ilitary cap abilities , in cluding its o wn air f orce; f or all intents and purposes, its own foreign serv ice with, indeed, its own foreign policy, though never at cross-purposes with funda mental US cold-war, anti-communist ideology and goals. 148"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Seem ingly without fear of exposur e or condemnation, the Agency felt free to carry out sundry Dr. Strangelove experim ents involving control of the hum an m ind a nd all m anner of biochem ical weapons, including the release of huge a mounts of bacteria into th e air in the United States whic h resulted in m uch illnes s and a number of death s. It was all very heady stu ff for the of ficer s of the CIA, playing their m en's gam es with their boys' toys. They recognized scarcely any lim itation upon their freedom of action. British colonial governors they were, and all the world was India. Then, in m id-April, cam e the disaster at the Bay of Pigs in Cuba. The international repercussions had barely be gun to subside when the Agency was again catapu lted into world h eadlin es. On 22 April four French generals in Algeria seized power in an attem pt to m aintain the country' s union with France. The putsch, which held out but four days, was a direct confr onta tion with Fr ench Presid ent Charle s de Gaulle, who had dram atically proclaim ed a policy leading \"not to an Algeria governed from France, but to an A lgerian Algeria\". The next day, the leftist Italian newspaper, II Paese, stated that \"It is not by chance that som e people in Pa ris are accus ing the Am erican secret s ervice headed by Allen Dulles of having participated in th e plot of the four ' ultra' generals.\" 1 Whet her Il Paese was the orig inal s ource of th is charge rem ains a m ystery. Dulles him self later wrote tha t the Ita lian daily was \"one of the first to launc h it\" ( emphasis added). He expressed the opini on t hat \"This pa rticular my th was a Communist plant, pure and simple.\" 2 The New York Times reported tha t the tum ors appa rently began circulating by word of m outh on the day of the putsch , 3 a report echoed by the Washington Star which added that som e of the rum ors were launc hed \"by m inor officials at the Elysée Palace itself\" who gave reporters \"to understand that the generals' plot wa s backed by strongly anti-comm unist e lem ents in the United State s Governm ent and m ilita ry se rvices. \" 4 Whatever its origins, the story spread rapidly around the world, and the French Foreign Of fice ref used to ref ute th e allega tion , Le Monde asserted in a front-p age edito ria l on 28 April tha t \"th e behavior of the U nited S tates during th e recent crisis was not par ticu larly skillf ul. It seem s estab lished that Am erican agents more or less encouraged Challe [the leader of th e putsch ] ... President Kennedy, of course, knew nothing of all this.\" 5 Reports f rom all sourc es were in agreem ent that if the CIA had ind eed been involved in the putsch, it had been so for two reasons: (11 the concern that if Algeria were granted its independence, \"communists\" would soon com e to power, being those in the ranks of the National Liberation Front (NLF) which had been fighting the French Arm y in Algeria f or sev eral ye ars— the legend ary Battle of Algiers. I t was with the NLF that d e Gaulle was ex pected to n egotia te a settlem ent; ( 2) the hop e that it wo uld precip itate the downfall of de Gaulle, an e nd desired because the French P residen t was a major stumbling block to US aspirations concerning NATO: a mong other things, he refused to incorporate French troo ps in to an integ rated m ilitary co mmand, and he opposed exclusive Am erican control over the alliance' s nuclear weapons.

F anciful as this m ay sound, the fact rem ains that the French governm ent took the possibility seri ously—French Prem ier Michel Debré went on television to warn the nation of an imm inent paratroop invasion of the Paris area and to urge m ass oppositio n. 6 Reaction in the Am erican press to the a llega tio ns had an u nmistakably m otley quality.

Sulzberger, who had been the m an at the New York Times clo sest to the CIA since its founding, stated flatly th at \"No Am erican in Algeria had to do with any insurrectional leader ... No consular em ployee saw any rebel.\" (A few days later, though, Secretary of State Dean Rusk disclose d that an em issary of the rebellious French generals had visited the US Consulat e in Algiers to reque st aid but had been summarily rebuffed.) The affair, wrote Sulzberger, was \"a delib erate effort to poison Franco-Am erican relationships\" begun in Moscow but abetted by \"anti-Am erican French officials\" and \"naive persons in W ashington ... When one checks, one finds all this began in a Moscow lzv estia article April 25.\" 10 This last, as we have seen, was incorrect. Dean of American co lumnists, W alter Lippm ann, who had seen de Gaulle in Paris shortly before the putsch, wrote: the reas on why the Frenc h Gove rnm ent ha s not really excul pated the CIA of encouragi ng t he Alge rian rebel gene rals is th at it was alread y so ang ry with th e CIA for m eddlin g in Fren ch in tern al po litics.

Som e French officials eventually declared the m atter to be cl osed, though they still failed to exp licitly rule o ut the a lleg ations abou t Am erican in volvem ent. 12 In early May 1961, L'E xpress, the widely-read French liberal week ly, published what was perhaps the f irst detailed account of the m ysterious affair.

Krief noted that Challe, despite an overweening ambiti on, was very cautious and serious-m inded: \"All the pe ople who know him well, are deeply convinced that he had been encouraged by the CIA to go ahead.\" At a luncheon in W ashington the previous year, Jacques S oustelle, the for mer Governor-G eneral of Algeria who had m ade public his disagreem ent with de Gaulle' s Algeria policy, had m et with CI A officials, in cluding Richar d Bissell, head of covert operations. Soustelle co nvinced the Agency o fficials, acco rding to Krie f, that Algeria would becom e, through de Gaulle' s blundering, \"a Soviet base\". This luncheon becam e som ething of a cause célebre in the speculation concerning the CIA' s possible role. The New York Times and others reported th at it had been give n by the Agency for Soustelle. 15 US officials, however, insisted that the luncheon had been arranged by som eone at the Fren ch Em bassy at Soustelle' s request. This French official, they said, had been present throughout the m eet ing an d thus there could have been no dark conspiracy. 16 W hy the French Em bassy would host a luncheon for a prom inent and bitter foe of de Gaulle, a m an who only two months earlier had been kicked out of de Gaulle' s cab inet for his \"ultra\" sym pathies, was not explained. Nor, for that m atter, why in proto col-m inded W ashington of all p laces , the CIA would attend. In any event, it seem s som ewhat fatuous to im ply that this was the only chance Soustelle and the C IA had to talk during his stay in the United States, which lasted more than a week. A clandestine m eeting in Madrid also received wide curren cy within the controversy. Krief dates it 12 April 1961, and describes it as a m eeting of \"various foreign agents, including m embers of the CIA and the Algiers conspirators, w ho disclosed their plans to the CIA m en\". The Americans were reported to have angrily com plained that de Gaulle' s policy was \"p aralyzing NATO a nd rendering the defense of Europe im possible\", and assured the generals th at if they an d their follo wers succeeded, Washington would recognize the new Alge rian G overnm ent within 48 hours. It m ay well be that th e French Govern ment did have evidence of the CIA's com plicity. But in the unnatural world of international diplom acy, this would not necessarily lead to an unam biguous public announcem ent. Such a m ove could result in an open confrontation between France and th e United States, a predicam ent both si des could be expected to take pains to avoid. Moreover, it m ight put the French in the position of having to do som ething about it. And what could they do? Breaking relations with the United States w as not a realistic op tion; neither were the French in any position to retaliate econom ically or m ilitarily. But Fren ch lead ers were too ang ry to s imply let the m atter pass into obscurity. Thus, to com plete the hypothetical scenario, they took the backdoor approach with all its shortcom ings. In a sim ilar vein, the United States k new that the Russians, for at leas t o ne year, were intercepting telephone calls in the US of governm ent and congressional officials, but said no thing publicly because it was unab le to end the practice for technical reasons. 17 And this concerned an \"enem y\", not an ally.

Ecuador 1960-1963 A textbook of dirty tricks If the Guinness Book of World Records included a category for \"cynicism \", one could suggest the CIA' s creation of \"leftis t\" organizations which condem ned pove rty, disease, illiteracy, capitalism , and the Unit ed States in o rder to attr act comm itted militants an d their m oney away f rom legitim ate lef tist o rganization s. The tiny nation of Ecuador in the early 1960s was, as it rem ains today, a classic of banana-republic underdevelopm ent; virtually at the bottom of the econom ic heap in South Am erica; a society in which one per cen t of the population received an income com parable to United States upper-class standards, while two-thirds of the people had an average fa mily incom e of about ten dol lars per m onth—people simply outside the money econom y, with little socia l in tegra tion or participa tion in the natio nal lif e; a ta le told m any tim es in Latin Am erica. In Septem ber 1960, a new governm ent headed by Jose Maria Velasco Ibarra cam e to power. Velasco had won a decisive elec toral victory, running on a vaguely liberal, populist, som ething-for-everyone platform . He was no Fidel Castro, he was not even a socialist, but he earned the wrath of th e US State Departm ent and the CIA by his unyield ing oppositio n to the two stated prio rities of American policy in Ecuad or: breaking relations with Cuba, and clam ping down hard on activists of the Comm unis t Party and those to their left. Over the next three ye ars, in pursu it of those goals, the CIA lef t as little as possible to chance. A veritable textbook on co vert subversion techni ques unfolded. In its pages co uld be found the following, based u pon the exp erien ces of Philip Agee, a CIA officer who spent th is period in Ecuador. 1 Alm ost all p olitica l org anizat ions of si gni ficance, fro m the far l eft to the far ri ght , were infiltrated, often at the highest levels. Am ongst ot her reasons, the left was infiltrated to channel young radicals aw ay from support to Cuba and from anti- Am ericanism ; the right, to instigate and co -ordinate activities along the lines of CIA priorities. If, at a po int in tim e, there wa s no organization that a ppea red well-su ited to serve a particular need, then one would be created. Or a new group of \"concerned citizens\" would appear, fronted with noted personalities, which m ight place a series of notices in lead ing newspapers denouncing the penetration of the governm ent by the ex trem e left and dem anding a break with Cuba. Or one of the noted person alities w ould deliver a sp eech prep ared by the CIA, and then a newspaper editor, or a well-k nown columnist, would praise it, both gentlem en being on the CIA payroll. Som e of these fronts had an actual existe nce; for others, ev en their exis tence was phoney. On one occasion, the CIA Officer who had created th e non-existent \"Ecuadorean Anti-Communist Front\" was surprise d to read in his m orning paper that a real organization with that nam e had b een founded. He changed the nam e of his organization to \"Ecuadorean Anti-Communist Action\". 153"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Wooing the working class cam e in for special em phasis.

Union leaders were invited to attend var ious classes conducted by the CIA in Ecuador or in the United S tates, all expenses paid, in order to im part to them the dangers of co mm unis m to the union m ove me nt and to select potential ag ents. This effort was not without its irony either. CIA agents would som etim es jealou sly vie with eac h other f or the best position s in these CIA -cre ated lab or organizations; and at tim es Ecuadorean orga nizations would m eet in \"international conferences\" with CIA labor fronts from other countries, with alm ost all of the participan ts blissf ully un aware of who was who or what was what. In Ecuador, as throughout m ost of La tin Am erica, the Agency planted phoney anti-comm unist news item s in co-operati ng newspapers. These item s would then be picked up by other CIA stations in Latin Am erica and dissem inated through a CIA- owned news agency, a CIA-owned radio statio n, or through countle ss journalists being paid on a piece-work ba sis, in add ition to the ite m being picked up unwitting ly by other media, including those in the United St ates.

In virtually every departm ent of the Ecuadorean governm ent could be found m en occupying p osition s, hig h and low, who colla borated with the CIA for money and/or their own particular m otivation. At one poi nt, the Agency could count am ongst thi s num ber the m en who we re second an d third in power in the country. These governm ent agents would receive th e benefits of inform ation obtained by the CIA through electronic eavesdropping or other m eans, enabling them to gain prestige and prom otion, or consolidate their current position in th e rough-and-tum ble of Ecuadorean politics. A high-rank ing m inister o f lef tist te ndencies, on the other hand, would be the target of a stea dy stream of negative propaganda from any or all sourc es in the CIA ars enal; staged dem onstrations agai nst him would further increase the pressure on the president to replace him . The Post master-General, along with other post office e mployees, all mem bers in good standing of the CIA Payrol l Club, regularly sent m ail a rriving from Cuba and the Soviet bloc to the Agency for its perusal, while custom s officials and the Directo r of Imm igration kept the Agency posted on w ho went to or cam e from Cuba.

These docum ents, publicized as m uch as possible, m ight include instruct ions on \"how to inte nsify h atred betwe en classe s\", or som e provocativ e lan guage de signe d to cause a split in Co mmunist Party ranks. Generally, the docum ents \"verified\" the worst fears of the public about communist plans to take over Ecuador under th e m asterm inding of Cuba or the Soviet Union; at th e sam e tim e, perhaps, implicat ing an im portant Ecuadorean leftist whose head th e A gency was af ter.

CIA-supported activities were carried out without the knowledge of the Am erican am bassador. W hen the Cuban Em bassy publicly charged the Agency with involvem ent in var ious a nti-Cuban a ctiv ities, th e Am erican ambassador issued a s tatem ent that \"h ad every one in the [CIA] stati on sm iling\".

Velasco was forced to resign and was replaced by Vice-president Carlos Ju lio Arosem ana. There were at th is tim e two prim e candidates for th e vice-p residency. One was the vice-president of the Senate, a CIA agent. The other w as the recto r of Cent ral University, a political moderate. The da y that Congress convened to m ake their choi ce, a notice appeared in a m orning paper announcing support for the rector by the Comm unist Party and a m ilitant leftist youth organization. The notice had been placed by a colum nist for the newspaper who was the principal propaganda agent for the CIA' s Qu ito station. The rector was com promised rather badly, the denials cam e too late, a nd the CIA m an won. His Age ncy salary was increased from $700 to $1,000 a m onth. Arosem ana soon prov ed no m ore accep tab le to the C IA than Velasco. All operations continued, particularly the cam paign to break relations with Cuba, which Arosem ana steadfastly refused to do. The deadlock was broken in March 1962 when a military garrison, led b y Col. Aurelio Nara njo, gave Arosem ana 72 hours to s end the Cubans packing and fire the leftist Minister of Labor. (There is no need to point out here who Naranjo' s financial benefactor was. ] Arosem ana complied with the ultim atum, booting ou t the Czech and Polish delegations as well at the behest of the new cab inet which had been forced upon him .

The Congo 1960-1964 The assassinati on of Patrice Lumumba Within days of its independence fro m Belgium on 30 June 1960, the land long known as the Belgian C ongo, and later as Zaire, was engulfed in strife and chaos as multiple in dividuals, tribes, and politi cal groups stru ggled for dom inance or independence. For the next several years the world press chroni cled the train of Congolese governm ents, the endless confusion of personalities and conspiracies, exotic place nam es like Stanleyville and Leopoldville, shocking sto ries of European hostag es and white m ercenaries, the brutality and the violence from all qua rte rs with its ra cist overtones. Into th is disorder th e W estern po wers were \"naturally\" drawn, principally Belgium to protec t its v ast m ineral investm ents, and the United States, m indful of t he fabulous wealth as well, and obsessed, as usual, with fighting \"communism \".

The C IA station in the Congo cabled Washington in August that \"E mbassy and station believe Congo experiencing classic comm unist effort [to] takeover governm ent.\" CIA Director Allen Dulles warned of a \"communist takeover of the Congo with disastrous consequences ... for the interests of the free world\". At the sam e tim e, Dulles authorized a crash-program fund of up to $100,000 to re place the existing government of Patric e Lum umba with a \"p ro-w estern g roup \". 1 It's not known what criteria the CIA applied to determ ine that Lumum ba's governm ent was going comm unist, but we do know how the Washington Post arrived a t the sam e conclusion: 156"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":" Western di plomats see ... th e part [of the Congo] controlled by volatile Prem ier Patrice Lu mumba slid ing slowly but surely in to the Co mmunist b loc. ...

On 11 July, the province of Katanga—hom e to the bulk of the Congo's copper, cobalt, uranium , gold, and other m ineral we alth—announced that it was seceding. Belgium , the princ ipal o wner of this f abulous wealth, never had any intention of giving up real control of the c ountry, and it now supported the m ove for Katanga's independence, perceiving the advantage of having its investm ents house d in their own little country, not acco untable to nor payi ng taxes to the central governm ent in Leopoldville. Katanga, moreover, was led by Moise Tshom be, a m an e mine ntly accomm odat ing to, and respectful of, whites and their investm ents. The Eisenhower adm inistration supported the Belgian m ilitary intervention on behalf of Katanga; indeed, the Am erican embassy had pr eviously requested such intervention. Influencing this policy, in addi tion to W ashington' s id eological aversion to Lum umba, was the fact th at a n umber of prom inent adm inistration officials had financial tie s to the Ka tanga wealth. 6 The Belgian intervention, which was a ve ry violent one, was denounced harshly by the Soviet Union, as well as m any countries from the Afro-Asian bloc, leading the UN Security Council on the 14th to authorize th e withdrawal of Belg ian troops and their repla cem ent by a Unite d Nations military f orce.

Unable to put down this up rising on his own, as well as one in another province, Lumum ba ha d appealed to the United Nations as well as the United States to supply him with trans port for his troops. W hen they both refused, he turned to the Soviet Union for a id, and received it, 8 though m ilitary success still eluded him . The Congo was in turmoil in m any places. In the m idst of it, on 5 Septem ber, President Joseph Kasavubu suddenly dism issed Lum umba a s prim e m inister—a step of very debatable legality, taken with much Am erican en couragem ent and assis tance, as Kasavubu \"sat at the feet of the CIA m en\". 9 The action w as taken, said the Church comm ittee later, \"despite the strong support for Lumum ba in the Congolese Parliam ent.\" 10 During the early 1960s, accord ing to a high ly-p laced CIA executiv e, th e Agency \"regularly bought and sold C ongolese politicians\". 11 US diplom atic sources subsequently confirm ed that Kasa vubu was am ongst the recipients. 12 Ha mm arskjold publicly endorsed the dism issal before the S ecurity Council, and when Lum umba tried to broadcast his case to the Congolese people, UN forces closed the radio station.

But he could taste th e fruits of his victory for onl y a few days, for on the 14th, arm y strongm an Joseph Mobutu too k power in a m ilitary coup designed by the United States.

The virus, which was supposed to produce a fatal disease indigenous to the Congo area of Africa, was transported via diplom atic pouch. 14 In 1975, th e Church comm ittee went on reco rd with the conclus ion that Allen Dulles had ordered L umumba's assassin atio n as \"an urgent and prim e objective\" (Dulles' s words). 15 After hearing the testim ony of severa l officials who believed that the order to kill the African lead er had em anated originally from President E isenhower, the comm ittee decided th at there was a \"reason able inf erenc e\" that th is was indeed the case. 16 As m atters evolved in the Congo, t he virus was never used, for the CI A's Congo station was unable to com e up with \"a secure enough agent with the right access\" to Lum umba before the potency of the biol ogical m aterial was no longer reliable.' 7 The Church comm ittee observed, however, that the CIA station in Leopoldville cont inued t o maintain cl ose cont act wi th C ongol ese w ho e xpresse d a desi re t o assassinate L umumba.

A 28 November CIA cable indicates that the Agency was involved in tracking down the charism atic Congo leader. The cable spoke of the CIA station worki ng with the Congolese gove rnm ent to get the roads blocked and troops alerted to clos e a possible escape route of Lum umba' s. 20 The United States had also been invol ved in the takeover of governm ent by Mobutu—whom author and CIA-confidant A ndrew Tully described as having been \"discovered\" by the CIA. 21 Mobutu detain ed Lu mum ba until 17 January 1961 when he transferred his prisoner into the hands of Moise Tshom be of Katanga province , Lum umba's bitter enem y. Lum umba was assass inated th e same day. In 1978, form er CIA Africa specialist John Stockwell related in his book how a ranking Agency officer had told him of driving around with Lum umba's body in the trunk of his car, \"trying to de cide w hat to do with it\". 22 W hat he did do with it has not yet been m ade public. During the period of Lumum ba's imprisonm ent, US diplom ats in the Congo were pursuing a policy of \"deploring\" his beatings and trying to secure \"hu mane treatment\" for him , albeit due to \"cons ider ations of in ternational opinion and not from tender feelings toward him \". 23 The imm ediate and the long-term effect of Lum umba' s m urder was to m ake him the m artyr and sym bol of anti-im peria l ism all over Af rica and elsewhere in the Th ird World which such Am erican officials had feared.

By the end of the m ont h, Gizenga was as well, and sim ultaneously, the leader of a rebel force that had set up a regim e in the Stanle yville area which it pr oclaim ed as the legitim ate governm ent of the entire Congo.

A subsequent CIA m emorandum was apparently paying tribute to this when it stat ed: \"The U.N. and the United States, in closely coordinated ac tivities, play ed essential roles in this significant success over Gizenga.\" 32 In January 1962, United Nations forces with strong Am erican backing ousted Gizenga and his followers from Stanleyville, and a year late r finally forced Tshom be t o end his secession in Katanga.

The next day, the Departm ent said that the flights would stop, after having obtained assurances from \"other arm s of the [U.S1 Governm ent\", although it still held to the position that the m atter was one between the Congolese governm ent and civilian individuals who were not violating Am erican law. 38 The Congolese ag ains t whom this array of m ilitary m ight was brought to b ear were a coalition of forces.

Mu ch chaos followed, and the repo rts are conflicting, but it appears that m ore than 2,000 hostages were rescued, in the process of which the fleeing rebels m assacred about 100 others and dragged several hundred more into the bush.

It would reinforce a big deve lopm ent plan announced this m orning in collaboration with the U nited States, Britain and West Germ any.\" 46 The collapse of the rebels' stronghold in Stanleyville m arked the beginning of the end for their cause. By spring 1965 their fortune was in sharp decline, and the arrival of about 100 Cuban revolutionaries, amongst w hom was Che Guevara him self, had no known effect upon the course of events. Several months later, Guevara returned to Cuba in disgust at the low level of revolutionary zeal exhibi ted by the Congolese guerrillas and the lo cal populace. 47 The conclu ding tun e for th e m usical chairs was played in Novem ber, when Joseph Mobutu overthrew Tshom be and Ka savubu. Mobutu, later to adopt the name Mobutu Sese Seko, has ruled with a h eavy dictatorial hand ever since. In th e final analy sis, it m attered preci ous little to the interes ts of the US governm ent whether the forces it had helped defeat were really \"c omm uni st\" or not, by whatever definition. The working prem ise was that there was now fixed in power, over a m ore-or-less unified Congo, a m an who would be m ore co-operative with the CIA in its African adventures an d with W estern capit al, and less ac cessible to th e socia list bloc, than the likes of Lumumba, Gizenga, et al. would have been.

Am bassador Cam pos pointed out to them that it was \"quite inappropriate\" for the Unite d States \"to try to inf luence the com position of the cabinet.\" 5 Attorney-General Robert Kennedy met with Goulart and expressed his uneasiness about the Brazilian president allowing \"comm unists\" to ho ld positions in governm ent agencies. (Bobby was presum ably acting on th e old and very deep-seated Am erican belief that once you welcom e one or two comm unists into your parlor, they take over the whole house and sign the deed over to Moscow.) Goul art did no t see this as a danger. He r eplied that h e was in f ull control of the situa tion, late r rem arking to Campos that it was as if he had been told that he had no capacity for judging the m en around him . 6 The Am erican Defense Attache in Brazil, Col. Vernon Walters, reported that Goulart sho wed f avoritism towards \"ultra-n ation alist\" m ilita ry of ficers over \"pro -U.S.\" officers. Goulart saw it as pr om oting those officers who appear ed to be most loyal to his government. He was, as it happens, very concerned about Am erican-encouraged military cou ps and said s o explic itly to Presiden t Kennedy. 7 Goulart considered purchasing helicopt ers from Poland because W ashington was delaying on his request to purchase them fr om the United States. Am bass ador Gordon told him that he \"could not expect the United States to like it\". 8 The Goulart adm inistration, m oreover, pass ed a law lim iting the am ount of profits multinationa ls could tr ansm it out of the country, and a subsidia ry of ITT was nationalized. Com pensation for the takeover was slow in com ing bec ause of Brazil' s precarious financial position, but these were the only significant actions taken against US corporate interes ts.

No Brazilian official was at th e airp ort th e n ext day to see t he en voy o ff. 13 Quadros, who had been elected by a record m argin, was, like Goularr, accused of seeking to set up a dictatorship because he sought to put teeth into m easures unpopular with the oligarchy, the m ilitary, an d/or the United States, as well as pu rsuing a \"p ro- communist\" foreign policy. After but seven months in office he suddenly resigned, reportedly under m ilitary pressu re, if not outright threat. In his letter of resignation, he blam ed his predicam ent on \"reactio naries \" and \"the am bitio ns of groups of individu als, som e of whom are foreigners ... the te rrible forces that arose against m e.\" 14 A few m ont hs later, Quadros reapp eared, to deliver a speech in which he nam ed Berle, Cabot, and US Tr easury Secretary D ouglas Dillon as b eing am ong those who had contributed to his downfall. Di llon, he said, sought to m ix foreign policy with Brazil's needs for foreign credits. 15 (Both Berle and Cabot had been advocates of the 1954 overthrow of Guatem ala n President Arbenz, whose sins, in W ashington' s eyes, were much the s ame as thos e Goular t was now guilty of .) 16 At the same tim e, Quadros announced his intention to lead a \"people' s crusade\" against the \"reactionaries, the corrupt and the Comm unists\". 17 As Quadros's vice p resid ent, Goulart su cceeded to the presid ency in Aug ust 1961 despite a virtual coup an d civil war initiated by s egm ents of the m ilitary to block him because he was seen as som e sort of dangerous radical. Only the interv ention of loyalist military units and other supporters of the c onstitutional process allo wed Goulart to take offi ce. 18 The m ilitary op position to Goulart aros e, it should be noted, b efore he had the opportunity to exhibit his alle ged tendencies toward dictator ship. Indeed, as early as 1954, the m ilitary had de monstrated its antip athy toward hi m by forcing Pres ident Vargas t o fire hi m fro m hi s position as Minister of Labor. 19 The Am erican doubts about Goulart also predated his pr esidency. In 1960, when Goulart was elected vice president, \"concern at the State D epartm ent and the Pe ntagon turned to pani c\" according to an Am erican official who served in Brazil. 20 Goulart tr ied to con tinu e Quadros' s i ndependent foreign policy. His governm ent went ahead with resum ption of relations with socialist countri es, and at a m eeting of the Organizatio n of Am erican States in Decem ber 1961 Brazil abstain ed on a vote to ho ld a special session aim ed at discussing \"the C uban problem \", and stood strongly opposed t o sanctions against the Castro governm ent. 21 A fe w m onths later, sp eaking be for e the US Congress, Goulart affirm ed Brazil' s right to take its own stand on som e of the cold-war issues.

The am bassador also met with form er president Juscelino Kubitschek to urge him to take a stronge r po sition again st Goulart and to us e his considerable influence to \"swing a large congressional group and thereby influence the legitim acy issue\". 46 Of the Am erican conting ency m easures, i ndicatio ns are that it was the naval show of force—which, it turned out, included an aircraft carrier, destroyers, and guided missiles— which m ost encouraged the Brazili an m ilitary plotters or convinced th ose still waver ing in the ir co mmitm ent. 47 Another ac tor in the un folding dra ma was the Am erican In stitu te f or F ree Labo r Developm ent.

In May 1963, the AIFLD founded t he Instituto Cultural Trabalho in Brazil which, over the next few years, gave courses to more than 7,000 union leaders and m embers. 48 Other Brazilians went to th e United States for train ing.

Indecision and cold feet intervened, however, and what m ight have revers ed the cours e of events in stead cam e to nought. Other m ilitary units loyal to Goulart took actions elsewher e, but these too fizzled out. 52 Here and there a scattering of workers went, out on strike; several short-lived, im potent demonstration s took place, but there was little else. A number of labor leaders and radicals were rounded up on the orders of certain state governors; those who were opposed to what was happening were not prepared for violent resistance; in one incident a group of students staged a protest—som e charged up the stairs of an Army organization, but the guard fired into their midst, killing tw o of them and forcing the others to fall back. 53 Most people counted on loyal arm ed for ces to do their dut y, or waited for the word from Goulart. Goulart, however, was unw illing to give the call f or a civil war ; he did not want to be responsible, he said, fo r bloodshed am ongst Brazilians, and fled t o Uruguay. 54 Lincoln Gordon cabled Washington the good news, suggesting the \"avoidance of a jubilant posture\". He described the coup as \"a great victory for the free world\", adding, in a rem ark that m ight have had difficulty getting past the lips of even John Foster Dulles, that without the coup there could have been a \"total loss to the West of all South Am erican Republics\". Following a victory parade in Rio on 2 April by those pleased with the coup—a March of Fa mily with God for Liberty—Gordon infor med the State Departm ent that the \"only unfortunate not e was the obviously lim ited participation in the m arch of the lower classes.\" 55 His cable work done, the form er Ha rvard pr ofessor turned his attention back to trying to persuade the Brazilian Congress to bestow a seal of \" legitim acy\" upon the new government 56 Two years later, Gordon was to be questioned by a senator during hearings to consider his nom ination as Secretary of St ate for Inter-Am erican Affairs. \"I am particularly concerned,\" said the senator, \"w ith the part you m ay have played, if any, in encouraging, prom oting, or causing that overthrow.\" Said Lincoln Gordon: \"The answer to that , senator, is very simple. The movem ent which overthrew President Goulart was a purely, 100 percent—not 99.44—but 100 percent purely Brazilian m ove ment. Neither the Am erican Em bassy nor I personally played any p art in the p rocess whats oever.\" 57 Gordon' s boss, Dean Rusk, was not any more forthright. W hen asked about Cuban charges that the United States was behind the cou p, the Secretary of Stat e responded: \"W ell, there is just not one iota of truth in this. It's just not so in any w ay, shape, or form.\" 58 While Attorney General Robert Kennedy' s view of the affair, stated to Gordon, was: \"W ell, Goulart got what was co ming to him .

Moreover, the So viet Union was scarcely in the pictu re. Early in 1964, reported a Brazilian newspaper, Russian leader Khrushchev told the Brazilian Comm unist Party that the Soviet governm ent did not wish either to give financial aid to the Goulart regim e or to ta ngle w ith th e Unite d States ove r the coun try . 62 In his rem iniscences—albeit, as m entioned ea rlier, not m eant to be a serious work of history—Khrushchev does not give an index reference to Brazil. A year after the coup, trade between Br azil and the USSR was running at $120 million per year and a Brazilian mission was planning to go to Moscow to explore Soviet willingness to provide a m ajor industrial plant. 63 The following year, the Russians in vited th e ne w Brazilian presiden t-to-be, General Costa e Silv a, to visit th e Soviet Union. 64 During the entire life of the m ilitary dict atorsh ip, extend ing into the 1980 s, Brazil and the Soviet bloc engaged in extensiv e trade and econom ic cooperation, reaching billions of dollars per year and including the building of several large hydroelectric plants in Brazil. A sim ilar econom ic relationship existed be tween the Soviet bloc and the Argen tine m ilitary dictatorsh ip of 1976-83, so m uch so that in 198 2, when Soviet leader Brezhnev died, the Ar gentine governm ent declared a national day of m ourning. 65 It was only by ignoring facts like these during the cold war that the anti- communist propagand a m achine of the United States could preach about the International Comm unist Conspi racy and claim that the cou p in Braz il had saved the country from communism .

It is a measure of the ultim ate cynicism of the Peruv ian and Am erican m ilitary authoritie s th at soldiers were stationed outside their hom e ar eas to lessen their resis tance when the order was given to shoot. 14 But it all worked. It worked so well that m ore than a decade was to pass before desperate men took to arm s again in Peru. 29. Dominican Republic 1960-1966 Saving democracy from communism by getting ri d of democracy On the night of 30 Ma y 1961, Ge neraliss im o Rafael Trujillo, m ass murderer, tortu rer p ar excellence, absolute dictator, was shot to death on a hi ghway in the outsk irts of the capital city, Ciudad Trujillo. The assass ination s et off a chain of ev ents over the next five years which featured sustained and rem arkably gross inte rvention into the in terna l af fairs of the Dom inican Republic by the United States, the li kes of which had not been seen in L atin Am erica since the heyday of Am erican gunboat diplom acy.

This historic event seem ed to suggest th at support of right-wing governments m ight no longer be the best way of checking the ri se of revolutionary m ovem ents in Latin Am erica, but rather m ight be fostering th em . Indeed, in June a force of Dom inican exiles launched an invasion of their hom eland from Cuba. Although the invasion was a com plete failure, it could only serve to he ighten W ashington' s concern about who was swimming around in \"T he Am erican Lake\". \"'Batista is to Castro as Trujillo is to ___' was the im plicit assum ption, and Washington wanted to ensure that it coul d help fill in the bl ank,\" is the way one analysis formulated the problem . \"As a result , the United States began to cast about for a way to get rid of Trujillo and at the sa me time to en sure a respons ible successor. \" 1 Ironically, it was to Trujillo' s Dom inican Republic that Batista had fled. The decis ion to topp le Trujillo was re inf orced in ea rly 196 0 when the United States sought to organize hem ispheric opposit ion to the Castro regim e. This policy ran head-on in to the fa miliar accusation that the United States opposed only leftist governm ents, never those of the right, no m atter how tyrannical. The close association with Trujillo, widely regarded as Washingt on' s \"protege\", was proving increasingly to be an em bar rassm ent. The circum stances we re such that Presid ent Eisenhower was led to observe that \"It' s certai n that American public opinion won' t condemn Castro until we have m oved against Trujillo.\" 2 (The president' s apparent belief in the independence of the Am erican m ind m ay have been overly generous, for Washi ngton w as supporting right-wing dicta torsh ips in Guatem ala, Nicaragua , Haiti and e lsewhere be fore and af ter Trujillo' s assassination, yet th e American public fell readily into line in condem ning Castro.) As early as 1958, the then-CIA chief of station in the Dom inican Republic, Lear Reed, along with several Dom inicans, had plotted an a ssassina tio n of Trujillo, one which never got off the ground. 3 What the Agency' s m otivation was, an d whether it was acting on its own or at the behest of hi gher echelons in Washington, is not known. However, in February 1960 the National Security Council' s Special Group in Washington gave consideration to a program of covert aid to an ti-Trujillo Do minicans. 4 Two months later, Eisenhower approved a c ontingency plan which provided, in part, that if the situation dete riora ted still f urther: \"the United States would imm ediately take politica l action to rem ove Trujillo f rom th e Dom inican Republic as so on as a suitable successor regim e can be induced to take ove r with the assurance of U.S. political, econom ic, and—if neces sary—m ilitary sup port.\" 5 Seem ingly unaware of the currents swirling abo ut him , Trujillo continued to live up to his gangster reputation. In June, his he nchm en blew up a car carrying Venezuelan President Rom ulo Betancourt, an outspoken critic of the Dom inican dictator. A s a result, W ashington cam e under renewed pressure from several of the more dem ocratic Caribbean countries for action ag ain st Trujill o. Betancourt, who had survived the b last, told US Secretary of State Christian He rter: \"If you don' t elim inate him , we wil l invade.\" 6 For a full year, the d issidents and v arious Am erican officials played clo ak-and- dagger games: There w ere m eetings in New York and W ashington, in Ciudad Trujillo and Venezuela; Am ericans living in the Dom inican Republic were enlisted for the cause by the CIA; schem es to overthrow T rujillo we re drawn up at differe nt times by the S tate Departm ent, the CIA, and the dissidents , som e approved by the Special Group.

Several of the requests were approved by the State Departm ent or the CIA; support for the dissident s was regularly reiterated at hi gh levels of the US governm ent ... yet, after all was said and done, none of the ambitious plans was ev en attem pted (the actual ass assination w as essentially a spur-of-the-m oment i mprovise d affair), only three pistols and three carbin es were ever pass ed to th e an ti-T rujillist as, and it is n ot cer tain th at any of th ese guns were used in the assassination.' In the final analys is, th e m ost signif icant aid rec eived by the diss idents from the United States was the as surance that the \"C olossus to the N orth\" would not intervene militarily to prevent the assass inatio n and would support them afterward s if they s et up a \"suitable\" governm ent. In Latin Am erica this is virtually a sine qua non for such undertakings, notably in the Dom inican Republ ic where American m arines have landed on four separate occasions in this centu ry, the last intervention having created a centralized Dom inican National Guard whic h the US placed under the control of a young officer it had trained nam ed Rafael Trujillo. The gap between the word and the deed of the Am erican governm ent concerning the assassination appears to have been th e consequence of a growing uncertainty in Washington about what would actu ally cake place in the wake of Trujillo' s dem ise— would a pro-Castro regim e emerge from the chaos? A secondary consideration, perhaps, was a reluctance to engage in political assassinat ion, both as a m atter of policy and as a desire to avoid, as one State Departm ent official put it, \"f urther tarnishing in the eyes of the world\" of the \"U.S. moral posture\". 8 This was particula rly the expre ssed f eeling of President John Kennedy and others in his adm inistration who had assum ed office in January 1961, although they we re later to undertake seve ral assassination attempts against Castro. The dism al failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion in April further dam pened the enthusiasm of W ashington offi cials for Caribbean adven tures (except against Cuba in revenge) and induced them to request a postponem ent of the assassination. The plotters, however, were well past the point of no return. The Dom inicans who pulled the triggers and the ir fellow co nspira tors w ere in no way revolutionaries. They cam e from the ranks of the conservative, privileged sectors of Dom inican society and were bound together pr im arily by an intense loathing of Trujillo, a personal vendetta—each of them, or som eone close to them , had s uffered a deep hum ilia tion at the h ands of the diabolical dictato r, if not tor ture or m urder.

As Kennedy put it: \"Balag uer is our only tool. The anticomm unist liberals aren' t strong enough. W e m ust use ou r influence to take Balaguer along the road to dem ocracy.\" 11 Just how comm itted John F . Ke nnedy was to democracy in the Dom inican Republic we shall p resen tly see. To m ake certain that th e Dom inicans got the message, a US naval task force of eight ships with 1,800 Marines aboard ap peared off the Dom inican coast on 19 Novem ber, just outs ide the three -mile lim it but in plain sight of Ciudad Trujillo. Spanish-language broadcasts from the offshor e ships warned that the Marines were prepared to com e ashore; while o verhead, Am erican jet fighters s treaked along the coastline. Brigad ier Ge neral Pedro Rodriguez Echevarr ía, a key m ilita ry f igure, was persuaded by the United States to put as ide any plans for a coup he m ay have been harboring and to suppo rt the Am erican act ion. Rodriguez proceeded— whether of his own initiative is not clear—to order the bom bing of the air base outside th e cap ital where Trujillistas had been m assing troops.

W ashington then turned around and issued another stern warning to General Rodr igu ez, threatene d Dom inican leaders with a large loss of aid if they supported a coup, and mounted another naval show-of-force to help other military officers block the genera l's attem pt to seiz e power. 1 - 1 While a seven-m an \"Council of State\" then adm inistered the affairs of governm ent, the US cont inued to treat the Dom inican Republic as its private experim ent in the prevention of communis m. The Am erican Am bassador, John Bartlow Martin, pressed the Council to curb left-wing activ ity. B y his own adm issi on, Martin urged the use of \"m ethods once used by the police in Chicago\": harassm ent of suspects by repeated arrests, m idnight raids on their hom es, beatings, etc. 14 When street disturbances erupted, US Attorney General Robert Kennedy arranged for riot-control equipm ent to be se nt to Santo Domingo (the original nam e of the cap ital, now restored). The equ ipm ent came com plete with two Spanish-speaking Los Angeles detectives to im part to their Do minican counterparts the fine art of quelling such uprisings that they had acquired in the Mexican barrios of east Lo s Angeles. In a few weeks. Am bassador Martin could report that the Council had \"rew on the streets, thanks a lmost entire ly to those two d etec tives \". 15 This riot-control unit rem ained as a pe rm anent part of the Santo Dom ingo police force. Known as the Cascos Blancos (white helm ets), they cam e to be much hated by the populace. Shortly afterwards, the US military underto ok a long-range program to transform the country' s arm ed forces into what was hoped would be an efficient anti- guerrilla organization, though gue rrillas were as rare on the Caribbean island as members of the Trujillo f amily. 16 Finally, in Decem ber 1962, electio ns were held, under term s dictated in large part by Ambassador Martin to the two m ajor candidates. His purpose was to introduce into the Do minican Republic som e of the f eat ures that Am ericans regard as necessary to a viab le an d dem ocratic electo ral s ystem , but Martin' s fiat was inescapably a highly condescending intrusion into the affair s of a supposedly sovereign nation. His instructions extended down to the level of what the loser should say in his concession speech. Further, under an \"Em ergency Law\", th e United States and the Council arranged for the deportation of som e 125 Trujillistas an d \"Castro c omm unists\" to the United States, from where they were no t a llowed to lea ve until af ter th e e lectio n in o rder \"to help m aintain stability so elections could be held\". 17 The winner, and first m ore-or-le ss-dem ocratically elected presiden t of the Dom inican Republic since 1924, was Juan Bosc h, a writer w ho had spent m any years in exile while Trujillo reigne d. Here at last was K ennedy' s liberal anti-communist, non- military and legally elected by a co mfortable majority as well. Bosch' s governm ent was to be the long-sought-after \"showcase of de mocracy\" that would put the lie to Fidel Castro. He was given the grand treatm ent in Washington shortly before he took office in February 1963. Bosch was true to his beliefs. He called for land reform , including transferring som e private land to the public sector as required; low-rent housing; m odest nationalization of business; an am bitious pr oject of public works, serving m ass needs more than vested inter ests; a r eduction in th e import of luxu ry item s; at the sam e tim e, he favored incentiv es to private en terprise and was open to foreign investm ent provided it was not excessively exploitative of the count ry—all in all, standard elem ents in the 179"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"program of any liberal Third World leader serious about social change.

L and reform and nationalization ar e always touchy issues in W ashington, the stuff that \"creeping socialism \" is m ade of. I n severa l quarters of the US press Bosch was red- baited and com pared with Castro, an d the Dom inican Repub lic with Cuba. (Castro, f or his part, branded Bosch a \"Yankee puppet\".) Some of the press criticism was clearly orchestrated, in the m anner of m any CIA ca mpaigns. 18 In both the United States and the Dom inican Republic, th e accusation s m ost frequently cast at Bosch were the o nes typically used against Latin A merican lea ders who do not vigorously suppress the left (cf. Arbenz and Goulart): Bosch was allow ing \"communists\" to \"infiltrate\" into the country and into the governm ent, and he was not countering \"communist subversio n\", the latter referring to no m ore than instances of people standing up for thei r long-denied ri ghts. W rote a reporter for the Miami News : \"Comm unist penetra tion of the Dom inican Republic is p rogressing w ith inc redib le speed and efficiency.\" He did not, however , nam e a single communist in the Bosch governm ent. As it happens, the reporter, Hal Hendrix, was a valuable press asset and a \"secret operative\" of the CIA in the 1960s. 19 The CIA m ade a furthe r contribution to the anti-Bosch atm osphere. Am bassador Martin has reported that the Agency \"gave rum ors [about communists in the Dom inican Republic] a credibility far hi gher than 1 would have ... In reporting a Castro /Communist plot, however w ildly im plausible, it is obviously safer to evaluate it as 'could be true' than as nonsense.\" 20 John F. Kennedy also soured on Bosch, particularly for his refusal to crack down on radic als. Said the p resident to Ambassador Martin one day: I'm won deri ng if the day m ight not come when he'd [B osc h] like to get rid of some of th e left.

Sa m Halper, for mer Caribbean Bureau Chief of Time magazine, later repo rted that the military co up ousting Bosch went into action \"as soon as they got a wink from the U.S. Pentagon\". 22 In July, a group of officers formally presented Bosch with a statem ent of principie-cu m-ultim atum : Their loyalty to his regim e was condition ed up on his adoption of a policy of rigorous and -communism . Bos ch reacted by going on television and delive ring a lectur e abo ut the apolitical ro le req uired of the m ilita ry in a dem ocratic society, surely an occu lt subject to th ese products of 31 years of Trujillo ism.

Cuba 1959 to 1980s The unforgivable revolution The existence of a revolutio nary socialist governm ent w ith growing ties to the Soviet Union only 90 m iles away, insisted the United States Governm ent, was a situation which no self-respecting superpow er should tolerate, and in 1961 it undertoo k an invasion of Cuba. But less tha n 50 m iles from the Soviet Un ion sat Pakistan, a close ally of the United States, a m ember since 1955 of th e South-East Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), the US-crea ted anti-com munist al liance. On the very border of the Soviet Union was Iran, an even closer ally of the Unite d State s, with its relen tless e lectronic listening po sts, aer ial s urveillanc e, and inf iltr ation into Russian ter ritor y by American agents. And alongside Iran, also bordering the S oviet Union, was Turkey, a m ember of the Russians' mortal enemy, NATO, since 1951. In 1962 during the \"Cuban Missile Crisis\", W ashington, seem ingly in a state of near-p anic, infor med the world that the Russians were installing \"offensive\" m issiles in Cuba. The US prom ptly instituted a \"quara ntine\" of the island—a powerful show of naval and m arine forces in the C aribbean would stop and search all vessels heading towards Cuba; any found to contain m ilitary cargo would be forced to tu rn back. The United States, how ever, had m issiles and bomber bases already in place in Turkey and other m issiles in W estern Europe pointed toward the Soviet Union.

W hen the Israelis bom bed PLO headquarters in Tunis in 1985, Ronald Reagan expressed his approval. The president asserted that nation s have the ri ght to retaliate against ter roris t attack s \"as long as you pick out th e people responsible\". 5 But if Cuba had dropped bom bs on any of the headquarters of the anti-Castro exiles in Miam i or New Jerse y, Ronald Reagan would likel y have gone to war, though for 25 years the Castro governm ent had been on the receiving end of an extraordinary series of terrorist attacks carried out in Cuba , in the United States, and in other countries by the exiles and their CIA m entors. (W e sh all not discuss the consequences of Cuba bom bing CIA headquarters.) Bom bing and strafing attack s of Cuba by planes base d in th e United Sta tes began in October 1959, if not before. 6 In early 1960, there were several fire-bom b air raids on Cu ban cane fields and sugar m ills, in which Am erican pilo ts als o took part—at leas t three of whom died in cras hes, while two others were captured. The State Departm ent acknowledg ed that on e plane which crashed, k illing two Am ericans, had taken of f from Florid a, but insis ted tha t it was again st the wish es of the US governm ent. 7 In March a French freighter un loadi ng m unitions from Belgium exploded in Havana taking 75 lives and injuring 200, som e of whom subsequently died.

Over 100 exiles died in the attack. Close to 1,200 others were ta ken prisoner by the Cubans. It was later revealed that four Am erican pilots flyi ng f or the CIA had lost their liv es a s well. 9 The Bay of Pigs assault had relied heav ily on the Cuban people rising up to join the invaders, 10 but this was not to be the case. As it was, the leade rship and ranks of the exile forces were riddled with for mer s upporters and henchm en of Fulgencio Batista, the dictator overthrown by Castro, and woul d not have been welcomed back by the Cuban people under any circum stances. Despite the fact tha t the Kennedy ad ministration was acutely em barrassed by the unm itigated def eat—ind eed, because of it—a cam paign of sm aller-scale attacks upon Cuba was initiated alm ost imm edia tely.

So unyielding has the em bargo been that w hen Cuba was hard hit by a hurri cane in October 1963, and Casa Cuba, a New York social club, rais ed a large quan tity of clothing for relie f, the United States refused to grant it an export license on the grounds that such sh ipm ent was \"contrary to the national inte rest\". 14 Moreover, pressure was brought to bear upon other countries to conform to the em bargo, and goods destined for Cuba were sabotaged: m achinery dam aged, chem icals added to lubricating fluids to cause rapid wear on diesel engines, a manufacturer in West Ger many paid to produce ball-bearings off-center, a nother to do the sam e with balanced wheel gears—\"You' re talking about big m oney,\" said a CIA officer involve d in the sabotage efforts, \"when you ask a m anufac turer to go along with you on that kind of project because he h as to reset h is whole m old.

The Japanese sh ip was able to continue on, but the cargo ship was beached on its sid e; the buses would have to be \"written off\", said the Leyland com pany. In the leading British newspapers it was just an accident story. 16 In the New York Times it was not even reported.

Six we eks later, an outbre ak of the d iseas e in Cuba forced the slaughter of 500,000 pigs to prevent a nationwide anim al epidem ic. The outbreak, th e first ever in the W estern hem isphere, was called the \"m ost alarm ing event\" of the year by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization. 23 Ten year s la ter, the ta rget m ay well have been human being s, as an ep idem ic of dengue fever swept th e Cuban island.

As of 1969, som e 550 students, from 36 countries, had com pleted courses at the US Army' s Che mical S chool at Fort McClellan, Alabam a. The CBW instruction w as provided to the students under the guise of \"defense\" against such weapon s—just as in Vietnam , as we have seen, tortu re was taught. A s will be described in th e chapter on Uruguay, the manufacture and use of bom bs was taught under the cover of combating terrorist bom bings. 30 The ingenu ity which we nt in to the c hem ical and biological warfare against Cuba was apparen t in som e of the do zens of plan s to assass inate or hum iliate Fidel Castr o. Devised by the CIA or Cuban exiles, with the cooperation of Am erican m afiosi, the plans ranged from poisoning Castro' s cigars and food to a chem ical designed to m ake his hair and beard fall of f and LSD to be ad ministered just b efore a public speech. Th ere were also o f course the m ore traditional approaches of gun and bom b, one being an attem pt to drop bom bs on a baseball stadiu m while Castro was speaking; the B -26 bom ber was driven away by anti-aircraft fire before it could reach the stadium . 31 It is a com bination of such Cuban security m eas ures, infor mers, incom petence, and lu ck which has served to keep the bear ded one alive to the present day. Attem pts were also m ade on the lives of Castro' s brother Raul and Che Guevara. The latter was the target of a bazooka fired at the United Nations building in New York in Decem ber 1964. 32 Va rious Cuban exile groups have engaged in violence on a regular basis in the United States with relative im punity for decades. One of them, going by the nam e of Om ega 7 and headquartered in Un ion City, New Jersey, was characterized by the FBI in 1980 as \"the m ost dangerous te rrorist organization in the United States\". 33 Attacks against Cuba itself began to lessen around the end of the 1960s, due probably to a lack of sa tisfying results com bined with ageing warriors, and exile groups turned to targe ts in th e United Sta tes and e lsewhere in th e world.

Dissent in Miam i has been effectively silenced, while the police, city officials, and the m edia look the other way, when not actually dem onstrating support for the exiles' campaign of intim idation. 37 In Miam i and elsewhere, the CIA—ostensib ly to uncover Castro agents—has em ployed exiles to spy on th eir countrym en, to keep files on th em , as well as on Am ericans who associate with them . 38 Although there has alw ays been the extr em e lunatic fringe in the Cuban exile community (as opposed to the normal lunatic fr inge) insisting that W ashington has sold out their cause, over the year s there has been only the o ccasional arrest and conviction of an exile f or a te rror ist attack in the United State s, so occ asiona l th at the ex iles c an only assum e that W ashington' s heart is not w holly in it.

At the trials and in the CIA Study, the attempt is m ade to establish that, in so doing, Sja m was acting on behalf of PKI leader Aidit. Presentation of this prem ise m ay explain why the CIA to ok the unique step of publishing such a book; i.e., to assign responsibility for the coup attem pt to the PKI so a s to \"justify\" the horror which followed. But Sjam could jus t as easily h ave b een acting for the CIA and/ or the generals in the sam e ma nner. He apparently was a truste d aide of Aidit and could have induced the PKI leader into the plot instead of th e other way around. Sjam had a politically checkered and m ysterious background, and his testim ony at one of the trials, in which he appeared as a defendant, was aim ed at esta blishing Aidit as the sole director of the coup attem pt. 15 The CIA, in its intim ate involvem ent in I ndonesian political affa irs since at least the m id-1950s (see Indonesia, 1957-58 chapte r), had undoubtedly infi ltrated the PKI at various leve ls, and the m ilitary eve n m ore so, and was th us in a goo d position to dissem inate disinfor mation and plant the idea s for certain actions, whether through Sjam or others. The desire of the US governm ent to be rid of Sukarno—a leader of the non- aligned and anti-im perialist m ove ments of the Third W orld, and a protector of the PKI—did not dim inish with the f ailure of the Agency-back ed m ilita ry u prising in 19 58. Am ongst the various reports of the early 1960s indicating a continuing interest in this end, a CIA m emorandum of June 1962 is stri kingly to the point.

Further, \"They agreed to liquidate President Sukarno, depending upon the situation and av ailable opportunities. (It is not clear t o me [t he CIA offi cer] whet her murder or o verthrow is intended b y the word liquidate.)\" 16 Whatever was intended, Sukarno was now, for all practical p urposes, elim inated as an inte rnationa l tho rn in th e f lesh. Of even greater s ignificance, th e PKI, which had been the largest Communist Party in the worl d outside the Soviet bloc and China, had been decim ated, its tattered re mnants driven underground. It could not have worked out bette r for th e United Sta tes and the n ew m ilita ry junta if it h ad been planne d. If the generals had been planning thei r own coup as alleged, the evidence is com pelling that the United States w as intim ately involved before, during and after the events of 30 Septem ber/1 October. One aspect of this ev idence is th e closenes s of the relationsh ip between th e Am erican and Indone sian m ilitary establish ments which the United States had been cultivating for m any years.

The la bor speci alist s of AI FLD had more t han a deca de's experie nce in the art of fomenting economic turmoil (or keepin g worker s quiescent when the occasion called f or it). 47 CIA pr opaganda mercha nts ha d a fie ld da y wit h the dis order and t he shor tages , exac erbating both by inst igating pa nic buyi ng. All the techni ques, th e whol e of the media satur ation, t he handy or gani zations created for each and every pur pose, so effici ent ly em ployed in 1964 and 1970, were fa cilitated by the virtually unli mited license granted the press: headlines and stories which spread rumors about eve rything from nationalizati ons to bad meat and undr inkabl e wate r ... \"Economic Chaos! Chile on Bri nk of Doom !\" i n the largest type one could ever expect to see in a news paper ... raising the specter of ci vil war, when not actuall y calling for it, literally ... alar mist stories which anywhere el se in the world would h ave been branded seditiou s ... the w orst of London's daily tabloids or the National Enquir er of the Unit ed State s appear a s staid a s a journal of dentistry by com parison. 48 In response, on a few occasi ons , the gover nme nt bri efly closed down a new spaper or m agazi ne, on t he left a s well as on t he ri ght , for endangering secur ity. 49 The Agency's routine support of the political oppositi on was extended to include the e xtre me rightist orga nization Pat ria y Li bertad, which the CIA reportedly helped to form, and whose members it trained in gue rrilla warf are and bombing techniques at schools in Bolivia and Lo s Fresnos, Texas. Patria y Libertad marched in rallies in f ull riot ge ar, engaged repeatedly in acts of violence and provocation, and its publications openly called f or a military coup. 50 The CIA was engage d in courting the m ilitary f or th e same end. Providing military equipment meant the norma l prese nce of US a dvi sers and the opportunity f or Americans to work closely with the Chileans. S ince 1969, the Agency had been establ ishing \"intelligence asset s\" in all three branches of t he Chilean ar med servi ces , and inc luded \" comma nd-l evel offi cers, field- and co mpany-grade offi cers, ret ired genera l staff offi cers and enlisted men.\" Empl oyi ng its us ual bl end of re al and fabr icated i nfor mation, al ong wit h for ged doc ume nts, t he CI A ende avor ed t o ke ep the of ficers \"o n th e ale rt\". One approach was t o convince them that, with Allende' s approval, the p olice inv estigations unit was ac ting in concert w ith Cuban intelligence to gather inf orm ation prejudicial to the army high command. 51 Ne ws papers in Santiago suppor ted by the CI A, particularly El Merc uri o, often concentrate d on i nflue ncing t he mili tary.

The papers stirred up ha tred against the governm ent in the ranks, and in som e cases ent ire colum ns were published which were calculated to change the opinion of a single officer, in one case an offi cer's wi fe. 52 The Agency also subsi dized a num ber of books and other kinds of publications in Chile. One was a short-lived anti-governm ent new slett er dir ected at the milita ry. 53 L ater th e CIA made use of a we ekly humor and political magazine, SEPA, aimed at the same audience. The covet of the 20 Marc h 1973 issue featured the headline: \"R obert M oss. A n English Reci pe for Chile—Military Co ntrol.\" Moss was identified by the m agazine as a B ritish sociologist. A mor e rel evant de scr iption would have been t hat he was a \" news\" spec ialist associated w ith know n C IA media fronts. One of these. Forum World Features of London (see Wester n Eur ope chapt er), publis hed Moss 's book, Chile' s Marxi st Experi ment , in 1973, whi ch was wide ly circ ulate d by the junt a t o justi fy it s c oup. 54 Moss was associated wit h a CI A- funded think-ta nk in Santia go which we nt by the supre mely i nnocuous na me of the Institute of Ge neral Studie s. The I GS, a mongst othe r activities, conducted seminars fo r Chilean military off icers in which it was explained, in technical, apolitical terms, wh y Allende was a disaster f or the econo my and why a laissez- faire system off ered a solution to Chile's ills. There is no way of measuring to what extent such lectures inf luenced future actions of the milita ry, although af ter the coup the junta di d appoint several IGS people to top governme nt post s. 55 The CI A's Sa ntiago st ation was meanwhile coll ecting the ope rat ional intelligence nec essary in the event of a co up: \"arrest lists, key civilian installations and personnel that nee ded prot ection, key governme nt install atio ns whi ch need t o be t aken over, and gov ern ment con ting ency plan s which would be us ed in cas e of a m ilitar y u prisin g.\" 56 The CIA later asserted tha t this inf ormation wa s never passed to the Ch ilean military, a claim that does not give one the f eeling of having bee n unite d wit h the proba ble. It should be noted in this context that in the days immediatel y following the coup the Chilean military we nt di rectly to the residences of many Am ericans and other foreigne rs living in Santiago who had been sym pathetic to the All ende gover nme nt. 57 The gover nment contingency plans were presumabl y obtai ned by the Age ncy through its i nfiltration of the variou s parties whi ch made up Allende 's Unidad Popul ar (UP) coalition. C IA agents in the upper echelons of A llend e's own Socialist P arty were \"paid to m ake m istakes i n their jobs\" . 58 In Was hington, bur glar y was t he Age ncy's tac tic of choice for obtaining docum ents. Papers we re taken from the hom es of several em ployees of the Chilean Embassy; and the embass y its elf, whi ch had been bugge d for some time, was burgled in May 1972 by som e of the same m en who the next m onth staged t he Wat ergate b reak-in. 59 In Marc h 1973, t he UP won a bout 44 perce nt of t he vote i n congres sional el ections, compared to som e 36 pe rcent in 1970. It was sa id to be the largest increase an incumbent party had ever received in Chil e after bein g in p ower m ore th an two years. The opposition parties had publicly expressed their opti mism about capturing two-thirds of the congres- sional seats and thus being able to im peach A llende.

In June, an abortive attack upo n the Pres identia l Palace was car ried ou t by the m ilitary and Patria y L ibertad. In September the milita ry prevailed. \"It is clear,\" sa id the Senate investigatin g commit tee, \"the CI A receive d intelligence repor ts on the coup planning of the gr oup which carried ou t the successf ul Septem ber 11 coup thro ughout t he months of J uly, August, and Septe mber 1.973.\" 61 The American role on that fateful day was one of substance and shadow. The coup b egan in th e Pacif ic coast port of V alparaiso w ith th e dispatch of C hilean na val troops to Sa ntiago, whil e US Na vy s hips were pr esent offshore, ostensi bly to participate in joint m aneuvers with th e Chilean Navy. The Am erican ships stayed outside of Chilean waters, but remai ned on the aler t. A US WB-575 pl ane—an air borne communica tions contr ol system—pil oted by US Air Force offi cers, cruised i n the Chilean sky. A t th e same time, 32 Am erican observa tion and fighter planes were landing at the US air base i n Mendoza, A rgentina, not far f rom th e Chilean border. 62 In Valparaiso, while US military off icers were meeting wi th their Chilean counterparts, a young Am erican, Charles Ho rm an, who lived in Santiago and was stranded near Valparai so by the coup, happen ed to e nga ge i n conversat ion wit h se veral Americans, civilian and m ilitary. A retired na val engineer told hi m: \"W e cam e down to do a job and it's done .\" One or two Ame rican mi litary me n a lso ga ve awa y cl ues they shouldn't have. A few days later, Hor man was arrested in his Santiago residence. They knew where to find hi m. H e was never seen again. 63 Thus it was that they clo sed the cou ntry to the o utside wor ld for a week, while the tanks rol led a nd the soldier s broke down do ors; the sta diums rang wit h the s ounds of exe cution and the bodie s piled up al ong t he stre ets and fl oat ed in the ri ver; the tort ure centers opened for business; the subversive books were thrown to the bonfires; soldiers slit the t rouser legs of w omen, shouting that \"In C hile w omen w ear dresses!\"; the poor retu rned to their natural state; and the men of the world in Washington a nd in the halls of international f inance op ened up t heir check-books. One ye ar la ter, P reside nt Ge rald F ord was moved t o decl are t hat what the United Stat es ha d done in Chile was \"in t he best int erest of th e pe opl e in Chil e a nd certainly in our own best interest.\" 64 The re mark could ha ve been punctuat ed with a pi nch of snuff.

It was of course de rigueur for some ot her official s and congres smen to as sert th at what the Unit ed Stat es had r eal ly done i n Chil e w as repel th e Sov iet thr eat to th e W ester n hem isphere. But Soviet behavior t owa rd the A llende governme nt si mply did not tally with any such hypothesis; the language of US intelligence reports conf irms that: \"Soviet overtu res to Allende ... characterized by cauti on and restraint \"; \"Soviet desire to avoid\" 215"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"another Cuba-typ e com mitm ent; Ru ssians \"a dvising A llende to p ut his re latio ns w ith th e United States in order ... to ease t he st rain bet ween the t wo c ountries.\" 66 A CIA study of 7 Septem ber 1970, t hree da ys after Al lende 's electoral vi ctory, concl uded: 1. The U.S. ha s no vital nati onal interests wi thi n Chile . There woul d, h owe ver, be ta ngi ble eco nomic losses. 2.

W hat can this mean but that the people of other countries m ight be inspired to consider their own social ist solution to the econom ic and social problem s th at beset them ? Allende' s Chile m ight thus turn out to be that specter that haunted the corridors of official W ashington: a successful exam ple of an al ternative to the capitalist model. Washington knows no he resy in the Third W orld but independence. In the case of Salvador Allende independence came clothed in an especially provocative costume—a Marxis t con stitu tion ally elected who continued to honor th e constitutio n. This would not do. It shook the very found ation stones upon which the a nti-communist tower is built: the doctrine , painstakin gly cultiva ted f or d ecades, that \"comm unists\" can tak e power only through force a nd deception, t hat they can re tain that power onl y thr ough terroriz ing and brainwashing the populatio n.
