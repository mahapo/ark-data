The Council accomplishes this mainly by promoting constructive debates and discussions, cl arifying world issues, and publishing Foreign Affairs, the leading journal on global issues. The Council is host to the wi dest possible range of views, but an advocate of none, though its research fellows and Independent Task Forces do take policy positions. THE COUNCIL TAKES NO INSTITUTIONAL POSITION ON POLICY ISSUES AND HAS NO AFFILIATION WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. ALL STATEMENTS OF FACT AND EXPRESSIONS OF OPINION CONTAINED IN ALL ITS PUBLICATIONS ARE THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE AUTHOR OR AUTHORS. The Council will sponsor an Independent Task Force when (1) an issue of current and critical importance to U.S. foreign policy arises, and (2) it seems that a group diverse in backgrounds and perspectives may, nonetheless, be able to reach a meaningful con sensus on a policy through private and nonpartisan deliberations. Typically, a Task Force meets between two and five times over a brief period to ensure the relevance of its work. Upon reaching a conclusion, a Task Force issues a re port, and the Council publishes its text and posts it on the Council website. Task Force reports can take three forms: (1) a strong and meaningful policy consensus, with Task Force memb ers endorsing the general policy thru st and judgments reached by the group, though not necessarily every finding and recommendation; (2) a report stating the various policy positions, each as sharply and fairly as possible; or (3) a “Chairman’s Report,” where Task Force members who agree with the Chairman’s Report ma y associate themselves with it, while those who disagree may submit dissenting statements. Upon reach ing a conclusion, a Task Force may also ask individuals who were not members of the Task For ce to associate themselves w ith the Task Force report to enhance its impact. All Task Force reports “ben chmark” their findings against current administration policy in order to make explicit areas of agreemen t and disagreement. The Task Force is solely responsible for its report. The Counc il takes no institutional position.

So warned the U.S. Commission on National Securi ty led by former Senators Gary Hart and Warren Rudman in their final report released on March 15, 2001. Hardly anyone in Washington or the mainstream media paid any attention. Th ey should not make the same mistake twice by overlooking the key finding from this Task Force report, again co-chaired by Senators Hart and Rudman: “A year after September 11, America re mains dangerously unprep ared to prevent and respond to a catastrophic terro rist attack on U.S. soil.” This chilling conclusion comes on the eve of what now appears to be a pending war with Iraq to dethrone Saddam Hussei n. It was arrived at by a bipa rtisan group that includes two former secretaries of state, two former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a former director of the CIA and FBI, and some of the nation’s most distinguished financia l, legal, and medical authorities. Of the dozens of I ndependent Task Forces that ha ve been assembled during my decade-long tenure as president of the Council on Foreign Relations, no report has been so timely or important. Around the anniversary of Septem ber 11, we were saturated w ith one-year retrospectives. If there are Americans on Main St reet or in the halls of government who have concluded that it is now time to get back to our “nor mal” lives, this report is manda tory reading. As the Task Force participants conclude, we are en tering a time of especi ally grave danger. We are preparing to attack a ruthless adversary w ho may well have access to weapons of mass destruction. Yet we will not see the full effect of many of the po st–September 11 initiatives undertaken by the president, Congress, governors, and mayors for some time. This is no one’s fault. It simply reflects the fact that you cannot turn a nation as large and comp lex as this one on a dime. Still, given the stakes—potentially the loss of thousands of inno cent American lives and the mass disruption of America’s economy and soci ety—there are things we must be doing on an emergency basis to reduce our vulnerabilities here at home. Let me stress that the Task Force report does all this without thinki ng about or placing political blame for what has not been done to prepare our nation against terror attacks. The Task Force was conceived and dedicated to creating a necessary sense of urgency and to helping get the necessary things done . This Task"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6 Force lays out a series of r ecommendations that should help gui de the nation’s efforts in the weeks and months ahead. My deepest appreciation and admiration go to Senators Warren Rudman and Gary Hart for agreeing to lead this Task Force. The Council and the nation owe a debt to them and all the distinguished Task Force members who brought thei r vast and diverse prof essional expertise to this enterprise. They selflessly agreed to serve on very short notice to prepare this report with the same sense of urgency that our current circumstan ces clearly warrant. On a personal note, having served with the two formidable former senato rs on their National Security Commission, I can think of no more qualified people to take on this responsibility. My thanks also go to Council senior fellow Stephen Flynn, who serv ed as project director, lendi ng his considerable expertise, draftsmanship, and independence of thought to crafting and informing what follows. He was very ably assisted by the Council’s Army military fellow, Colonel (P) Sal Cambria, and research associates Rob Knake and Uday Ram. This Task Force has made an outstanding contribution to informing how we should proceed in the post–September 11 security enviro nment. Shame on us if we do not pay heed both to the warning and wisdom of what is outlined on the pages that follow. Leslie H. Gelb President Council on Foreign Relations"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS When Les Gelb approached me in late July with the proposal that I serve as project director for an Independent Task Force on Homeland Security Imperatives, I voiced some trepidation. His aim was for the Task Force to operate esse ntially on a wartime footing—something our homefront rightfully should be on, given the likelihood of a second catastrophic terrorist attack more deadly and disruptive than what we suffered on September 11, 2001. I wondered aloud if we could assemble a blue-ribbon task force with just a couple of weeks notice and demand so much of their time and energy in the following sixty-day period. As soon as he told me that Senator Warren Rudman and Senator Gary Hart ha d agreed to co-chair the Task Force, my doubts evaporated. I had the privilege to serve with them while they were at the helm of the now famous Hart-Rudman U.S. Commis sion on National Security. There could be no better chairs for this initiative as even ts over the ensuing weeks proved. I count it as a highlight of my professional career to have again been affo rded the opportunity to work with them. I have drawn added inspiration from the genero sity of intellect, wisdom, and time of all our distinguished Task Force members. What a speci al experience it has been to be a part of an enterprise with these most extraordinary Americ ans. Secretary George Shultz, Secretary Warren Christopher, General John Vessey, Admiral William Crowe, General Charles Boyd, Judge William Webster, Dr. Joshua Lederberg, Dr. Haro ld Varmus, Dr. Steven Weinberg, Dean Ann- Marie Slaughter, Mr. Phillip Odeen, Mr. Donald Marron, Mr. Stephen Friedman, and Mr. James Kallstrom—thank you for your grace and responsivene ss in the face of dr aconian deadlines, and a steady stream of late night e-mails, faxes, and phone calls. My debt to Les Gelb extends beyond his afford ing me the opportunity to serve as project director—he also made every possible Council resource available to support me. He was instrumental in sharpening the focus, structure, and language of the initia l concept paper that got us launched. Most importantly he assigned my co lleague, Colonel (P) Sal Cambria, to serve as the Task Force coordinator. Colonel (P) Camb ria has flawlessly tended to the innumerable details to get the Task Force from its starting point to the finish line. Finally, I have received extraordinary research support fr om two of the Council’s brightes t and most energetic research associates, Rob Knake and Uday Ram.

Stephen E. Flynn Project Director "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY “When you see the multiple attacks that you’ ve seen occur around the world, from Bali to Kuwait, the number of failed attacks that have been attempted, the various messages that have been issued by senior al-Qaeda leaders, you must make the assumption that al-Qaeda is in an execution phase and intends to strike us both here and overseas; that’s unambiguous as far as I am concerned.” —George Tenet, Director, Central Intelligence Testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, October 17, 2002 A year after September 11, 2001, America remain s dangerously unprepared to prevent and respond to a catastrophic terrorist attack on U.S. so il. In all likelihood, the next attack will result in even greater casualties and widespread disr uption to American lives and the economy. The need for immediate action is made more urgent by the prospect of the United States going to war with Iraq and the possibility that Saddam Hussein might threaten the use of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in America. The Task Force recognizes that important a nd generally salutary measures have been undertaken since September 11 to respond to th e risk of catastrophic terrorism, including pending legislation to create the Department of Homeland Securit y, which should be enacted on an urgent basis. Yet, there is still cause for concern. After a year without a new attack, there are already signs that Americans are lapsing back into complacency. Also, a war with Iraq could consume virtually all the nation’ s attention and command the bulk of the available resources. President Bush has declared that combating te rrorism requires a war on two fronts—at home and abroad. The Task Force believes the nation shou ld respond accordingly. It outlines a number of homeland security priorities that should be pursu ed with the same sense of urgency and national purpose as our overseas exertions. Among the risks that the Unite d States still confronts: • 650,000 local and state police offi cials continue to operate in a virtual intelligence vacuum, without access to terro rist watch lists pr ovided by the U.S. Department of State to immigration a nd consular officials. • While 50,000 federal screeners are being hi red at the nation’s airports to check passengers, only the tiniest percentage of c ontainers, ships, truc ks, and trains that enter the United States each day are subject to examination—and a weapon of mass destruction could well be hidden among this cargo. Should the maritime or surface elements of America’s globa l transportation system be used as a weapon delivery"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 10 device, the response right now would almost cer tainly be to shut the system down at an enormous cost to the economies of th e United States and its trade partners. • First responders—police, fire, emergency medical technician personnel—are not prepared for a chemical or biological atta ck. Their radios cannot communicate with one another, and they lack the training and protective gear to protect themselves and the public in an emergency. The consequence of this could be the unnecessary loss of thousands of American lives. • America’s own ill-prepared response could hur t its people to a much greater extent than any single attack by a terrorist. Am erica is a powerful and resilient nation, and terrorists are not supermen. But the risk of self-inflicted harm to America’s liberties and way of life is greatest during and immediately following a national trauma. • An adversary intent on disrupting America’ s reliance on energy need not target oil fields in the Middle East. The homeland in frastructure for refining and distributing energy to support the daily lives of Americans remain s largely unprotected to sabotage. • While the overwhelming majority of the nati on’s critical infrastr ucture is owned and operated by the private sector , significant legal barriers remain to forging effective private-public partnerships on homeland s ecurity issues. These include potential antitrust conflicts, concerns about the public release of se nsitive security information by way of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), and liability exposure. • Domestic security measures must be pursu ed within an international context. The critical infrastructures that support the daily lives of Am ericans are linked to global networks. Efforts to protect these systems will fail unless they are pursued abroad as well as at home. • The National Guard is currently equipped and trained primarily for carrying out its role in supporting conventional combat units overseas. The homeland security mission can draw on many of these capabilit ies but it requires added emphasis on bolstering the capacity of National Guard uni ts to respond to biological attacks; acquiring protection, detection, and other eq uipment that is tailored for complex urban environments; and special training to pr ovide civil support in the aftermath of a large-scale catastrophic attack."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 11 KEY RECOMMENDATIONS • Empower front-line agents to intercept te rrorists by establishi ng a twenty-four–hour operations center in each state that can pr ovide access to terrorist watch list information via real time intergovernmental links be tween local and federal law enforcement. • Make first responders ready to respond by im mediately providing federal funds to clear the backlog of requests for protective gear , training, and communi cations equipment. State and local budgets ca nnot bankroll these necessi ties in the near term. • Recalibrate the agenda for tran sportation security; the vulnerabilities are greater and the stakes are higher in the sea a nd land modes than in commerci al aviation. Systems such as those used in the aviation sector, which st art from the assumption that every passenger and every bag of luggage poses an equal risk, must give way to more intelligence-driven and layered security approaches that em phasize prescreening and monitoring based on risk-criteria. • Fund energy distribution vulnerability assessmen ts to be completed in no more than six months, fund a stockpil e of modular backup components to quickly restore the operation of the energy grid should it be targeted, and work with Canada to put in place adequate security measures for binational pipelines. • Strengthen the capacity of local, state, and fe deral public heath and agricultural agencies to detect and conduct disease outbreak investigations. The key to mitigating casualties associated with a biological attack against people or the food supply is to identify the source of infection as early as possible. • Enact an “Omnibus Anti-Red Tape” law with a two-year sunset clause for approved private-public homeland security task forces to include: (1) a fast-track security clearance process that permits the sharing of “secret-l evel” classified information with non-federal and industry leaders; (2) a FOIA exemption in instances when crit ical infrastructure industry leaders agree to share information about their security vulnerabilities with federal agencies; (3) an exemption of privat e participants in these task forces from antitrust rules; (4) homeland s ecurity appropriations to be managed under the more liberal rules governing research and de velopment programs in the Depa rtment of Defense rather than the normal Federal Acquisition Rules; and (5) liability safeguards and limits."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 12 • Fund, equip, and train National Guard units arou nd the country to ensure they can support the new state homeland security plans under development by each governor. Also, triple the number of National Guard Weapons of Mass Destruction Support Teams from twenty-two to sixty-six. Quickly mobilizing the nation to prepare for the wo rst is an act of prudence, not fatalism. In the twenty-first century, security and liberty are inseparable. The absence of adequate security elevates the risk that laws will be passed immediat ely in the wake of surprise terrorist attacks that will be reactive, not deliberative. Predictably, the consequence wi ll be to compound the initial harm incurred by a tragic event with measures that overreach in terms of imposing costly new security mandates and the assumption of new government authorities that may erode our freedoms. Accordingly, aggressive ly pursuing America’s homeland security imperatives quickly and immediately may well be the most important thing we can do to sustain America’s cherished freedoms for future generations. Preparedness at home plays a critical role in combating terrorism by reducing its appeal as an effective means of warfare. Acts of catastrophi c terrorism produce not only deaths and physical destruction but also societal and economic disruption. Thus, as important as it is to try and attack terrorist organizations overseas and isolate thos e who support them, it is equally important to eliminate the incentive for undertaking these acts in the first place. By sharply reducing, if not eliminating, the disruptive effects of terrorism , America’s adversaries may be deterred from taking their battles to the stre ets of the American homeland."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 13 TASK FORCE REPORT I NTRODUCTION A year after September 11, 2001, America remain s dangerously unprepared to prevent and respond to a catastrophic terrorist attack on U.S. so il. In all likelihood, the next attack will result in even greater casualties and widespread disr uption to American lives and the economy. The need for immediate action is made more urgent by the prospect of the United States going to war with Iraq and the possibility that Saddam Hussein might threaten the use of weapons of mass destruction in America. This report’s recommendations are intended to focus the nation on what must be done on an emergency basis to prevent attacks and to limit the consequences of these attacks should U.S. prevention efforts fail. The Bush administra tion, Congress, governors, and mayors around the country have taken important measures since Sept ember 11 to respond to th e risk of catastrophic terrorism. Legislation creating the Department of Homeland Security shoul d be enacted on an urgent basis, and initiatives to improve U.S. intelligence operations must go forward. But the United States will not see the full effect of thes e fundamental changes for several years. In the meantime Americans cannot afford to become complacent. Our enemies are not idle. The Task Force identified six critical ma ndates that deserve the nation’s immediate attention: • Empower front-line agents to pr event terrorist attacks and ma ke first responders ready to respond; 650,000 local and state law enfo rcement officers are operating in a counterterrorism information vacuum, and firs t responders are not nearly ready enough to respond to catastrophic events. • Make trade security a global priority; th e system for moving goods affordably and reliably around the world is ripe for exploi tation and vulnerable to mass disruption by terrorists. • Set critical infrastructure protection priorities ; some potential target s pose a graver risk for mass disruption than others. • Enhance America’s public health system so that it is able to quickly detect and respond to biological attacks."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 14 • Move quickly to clear federal obstacles to forging effective private-public security partnerships by addressing industr y concerns with respect to pot ential antitrust conflicts, public release of sensitive security info rmation by way of the FOIA, and liability exposure. • Fund, train, and equip the National Guard to make homeland security a primary mission. U NDERTAKING THE H OMELAND S ECURITY I MPERATIVE The nation must accept three facts of life after September 11. First, America is in a war against terrorists who want to attack its homeland, and it must act urgen tly to reduce its most serious vulnerabilities. Second, bolster ing America’s emergency preparedness in the near term is essential to minimizing casualties when an incide nt occurs on U.S. soil. Third, America’s own ill-prepared response can do more damage to its ci tizens than any single attack by a terrorist. America is a powerful and resilient nation, and terr orists are not supermen. But the risk of self- inflicted harm to America’s liberties and way of life is greates t during and immediately following a national trauma. Accordingly, preparing for the worst is an essential investment in preserving America at its best. On September 11 we witnessed how warfare will likely be conducted against the United States for the foreseeable future. Prudence requir es we assume America’s adversaries, including Saddam Hussein, have lear ned from the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, as well as the anthrax mailings, the extent to which the U.S. home land is unprotected. They will also have observed that relatively low-cost terro rist operations directed at civilian targets can inflict extensive damage and pr ofound disruption. In short, as l ong as catastrophic attacks are likely to yield tangible results in undermining America’s econom y and way of life, undertaking these attacks will be attractive to thos e who regard America as their enemy. The Task Force identified several overarc hing considerations that should guide the nation’s approach to homeland security. Homeland security measures have deterrence value : U.S. counterterrorism initiatives abroad can be reinforced by making the U.S. homeland a less tempting target. We can transform the"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 15 calculations of would-be terrorists by elevating the risk that (1) an attack on the United States will fail, and (2) the disruptive consequences of a successful attack w ill be minimal. It is especially critical that we bolster this deterren t now since an inevitable consequence of the U.S. government’s stepped-up military and diplomatic exertions will be to elevate the incentive to strike back before these effort s have their desired effect. Federalism is a major asset : Given the size and complexity of the American society, there are no “one-size-fits-all” approaches to addressing th e nation’s most serious homeland vulnerabilities. Private sector leaders and local authorities who ar e most familiar with those vulnerabilities will generally have the best insights on the most effe ctive solutions. National coordination, resource support, and leadership by the federal government are all essential. But encouraging the capacity for states, localities, and the private sector to ex periment and to be flexible in adapting to local and regional circumstances will ensure that our nation’s approach to homeland security will be as dynamic as the threat that confronts us. Domestic security measures must be pursued within an international context : The critical infrastructures that support the activities of our daily lives are linked to global networks. For example, the Northeast is dependent on electrical power generated in Quebec, and much of the natural gas used to fuel the power plants on the We st Coast originates in the western provinces of Canada. Computer viruses such as the “Love Bug” know no boundaries as they cascade around the Internet at the speed of light . Many of the goods that fill Amer ica’s stores originate from far flung corners of the globe and arrive at U.S. borders in massive volumes via an extremely efficient and low-cost land, sea, and air transportation system. Efforts to protect these systems will fail unless they are pursued abroad as well as at home. The State Department, Treasury Department, Commerce Department, and Office of the U.S. Trade Representative all have a critical role to play in making sure that our alli es and trade partners work with us to ensure a collective approach to protecting critical infr astructures as we did with the Year 2000 (Y2K) computer challenge. Proceed with caution when embracing technological security “fixes” : Technology can often serve as an enabler, but it must belong to a layered and dynamic system of defense that"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 16 incorporates the contribution of human intu ition and judgment. Any proposed technological “solution” must be evaluated ag ainst the costs and consequences if it should be compromised. In the end, security is not just a bout protecting American lives. It is also about sustaining systems that support our way of life in th e face of designs to e xploit or target those systems. This means that the security protocol must be able to mana ge any suspected or real terrorist breach without imposing costs so high as to compromise the very network it is designed to secure. Ultimately, the end game must be to continue to live and pr osper as an open, globally engaged society, not to become a nation trapped behind the mode rn versions of moats and castles. Emergency preparedness can save lives—potentially a lot of lives : During the Cold War, the prevailing view among most Americans was that civil defense measures were futile—even self- defeating. Nuclear war was viewed as Armageddon, and preparations to su rvive a nuclear strike were seen as making nuclear war more probable because they eroded the presumed deterrence value of the “balance of terror.” The contempor ary security environment mandates that we put this anti–civil defense bias behind us. America’s ability to strike b ack with devastating force will not deter terrorists. Meanwhile a nuclear, chemi cal, or biological weapon poses a grave danger not only to those who are immedi ately exposed, but also to the entire emergency response and medical care system in the areas where such a weapon might be used. Heavy losses of seasoned firefighters, emergency technicians, police, and medical personnel ca n easily compromise a community’s long-term capacity to provi de for public health and safety. A proactive mindset is key : The federal government is dedicat ing an extraordinary amount of energy and resources in response to the specific character of the September 11 attacks. Congress was quick to rush into law the “Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001,” which had the result of focusing the senior leadership in the U.S. Department of Transportation almost exclusively on hiring federal aviation passenger screeners and deploying new x-ray machines to the nation’s airports. This kind of legislativ e response is understandab le given the collective horror we shared in seeing hijacked commercial airliners used as missiles. Still, a reactive mindset is inevitably wasteful in terms of resour ces and can distract agen cies from anticipating more probable future scenarios a nd undertaking protective measures. "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 17 Homeland security measures will almost always have derivative benefits for other public and private goods : Terrorists may acquire a weapon of mass destruction, but they will not have unlimited access to these weapons. Consequently, they have to be selective about where, when, and how they will carry out an attack. No mayor or industry leader will want to be caught unprepared if his/her city or cri tical infrastructure is targeted. But making a case for investing in security safeguards for low probability/high conseque nce events can be a hard sell to a tax-wary populace or CEOs under pressure to guard the bottom line. Fortunately, many appropriate measures enacted to prevent and mitigate the consequences of a terrorist attack have other bene fits. Bolstering the tools to detect and intercept terrorists will enhance the means au thorities have to combat criminal acts like cargo theft, violations of export cont rols, and narcotics- and migrant-smu ggling. The tools used to save lives and property in the wake of a ca tastrophic terrorist act are largel y the same as those that would be used in the event of a tragic industrial or transportation accident or natural disaster. As a result, some of the costs may be offset by reduced losses and lower insurance rates. Public health investments will inevitably provide the United Stat es with more effective tools to manage the rising incidence of global dise ases and pandemics. In short, sustaining support for actions to confront the new security environment may not be as difficult as it first appears because many of these measures can tangibly improve the qua lity of life for our society as well. I DENTIFYING H OMELAND S ECURITY I MPERATIVES The Task Force recognizes that many useful initiativ es are now underway that will advance homeland security. The case for establishing a new Department of Homeland Security is a compelling one, and legislation to create this department shoul d be enacted without delay. The National Strategy for Homeland Security released by the White H ouse on July 16, 2002, makes a salutary effort to frame this complex mission an d to sketch out prioriti es. Equally commendable is the extent to which the strategy recognize s the importance of bolstering intelligence and warning systems, improving border and tran sportation security, enhancing domestic counterterrorism, protecting criti cal infrastructure and key asse ts, defending against catastrophic threats, and improving emergency preparedness and response."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 18 In addition to reviewing the president’s new strategy, the Task Force reviewed other recent contributions to the homeland s ecurity dialogue, most notably th e National Academies’ June 30, 2002, report Making the Nation Safer . In selecting the imperatives on which to focus, the Task Force decided to place its emphasis on issues that satisfied the following three criteria: (1) the potential consequences of neglecting th e imperative area are serious and well- documented; (2) the recommendations for addressing the im perative can be acted upon quickly; but (3) these recommendations are not being pursued on an emergency basis. The six critical mandates summarized above and detailed in the following sections represent only a portion of the homeland security agenda fo r our nation. There are ot her issues that we examined and judged to be very important but decided the measures to address them were adequate. For example, the president’s Critical Infrastructure Protection Board—created in October 2001—recently released a draft National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace for public comment. This plan—developed by a private-pub lic partnership invol ving corporate and nongovernmental organizations—outlines a compre hensive strategy to protect against the disruption of the complex, interdependent network of critical infrastructure information systems that is essential to America’s national and economic security. Other issues require much more study before government actions should be taken on an expedited basis. For instance, preventive vaccinations of the general population against diseases like smallpox may be harmful and even fatal for a small percentage of healthy people and are not presently an option for the millions of Americans with weakened immune systems. In short, the Task Force’s list is inevitably an incomplete one. Nonetheless, the Task Force believes that acting on the critical issues target ed in this report with the ki nd of urgency our wartime footing mandates would contribute significantly to U.S. security in the months and years ahead. The nation’s leaders in Washington, state capitals, c ounties, city halls, and boardrooms should be working overtime to address them—right now."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 19 I SSUES AND R ECOMMENDATIONS 1.

One front is Afghanistan, where we have the best technol ogy, the best equipment, the best intelligence being sent right to the front, and no expense is spared. Bu t for the first time in nearly 200 years, the second front is right here at home. And to date, it’s where we’ve seen the greatest loss of life. Yet we have in sufficient equipment, too little training, and a lack of intelligence sharing with federal authorities.” —Martin O’Malley, Mayor of Baltimore, April 10, 2002 There are an estimated 8.5 million illegal aliens living in the Un ited States, including nearly 300,000 fugitive aliens who have opte d for life as a fugitive rath er than submitting to a final order of deportation. Stowaways a rriving in U.S. ports and jump ing ship are almost a daily occurrence. These illegal migrants find it easy to blend in among the tens of millions of foreigners who arrive legally in the United States each year to travel, study, or work. Compounding the problem is widespread trafficking in forged or fraudulently obtained passports, licenses, and other identification documents. Baseline documents such as social security cards, birth certificates, and drive r’s licenses are pa rticularly subject to abuse. With just fifty-six field offices around the na tion, the burden of identifying and intercepting terrorists in our midst is a task well beyond the scope of th e Federal Bureau of Investigation. This burden could and should be shared with 650,000 local, county, and state law enforcement officers, but they clearly cannot lend a ha nd in a counterterrorism information void. When it comes to combating terrorism, the police officers on the beat are effectively operating deaf, dumb, and blind. Terrorist watch lis ts provided by the U.S. Department of State to immigration and consular officials are still out of bounds for state a nd local police. In the interim period as information sharing issues get worked out, known terrorists will be free to move about to plan and execute their attacks. And if a catastrophic terrorist attack occurred today, emergency first responders —police, firefighters, and em ergency medical personnel—in most of the nation’s cities and counties are no bette r prepared to react now than they were prior to September 11. The tools of emergency prepare dness are in very shor t supply. For instance, according to a survey done by the U.S. Conference of Mayors earlier this year:"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 20 • 79% of mayors reported a funding shortfall fo r necessary threat detection equipment; 77% for emergency response equipment; and 69% for personal protective apparel. • 86% said they did not have adequate personal protectiv e apparel and only 10% were satisfied with the protective equipment they had in the event of a biological attack.\" COMMUNICATIONS In virtually every major city and count y in the United States, no interoperable communications system exists to support police, fire departments, and county, state, regional, and federal response personnel during a major emer gency. Radio frequencies are not available to support the post–incident communica tion demands that will be pla ced on them, and most cities have no redundant systems to use as backups. Portable radios will not work in high-rise buildings unless the buildings are equipped with repeater systems. Most U.S. cities have separate command-and-control functions fo r their police and fire depart ments, and little to no coordination exists between the two organizations. Furthermore, with few exceptions, first- responder commanders do not have access to secu re radios, telephones, or video-conferencing capabilities that can support communications with county, st ate, and federal emergency preparedness officials or National Guard leaders. PROTECTIVE GEAR In the event of a chemical attack, a window of a few minutes to two hours exists to respond to the incident before morbidity and mortality rates skyrocket. Yet protective gear is often available only to a few specialized incident resp onse teams. Most communities will run short of even the most basic emergency response res ources (e.g., life-saving equipment, personal protection suits, oxygen, respirator s, etc.) in six hours. Federal agency response teams can help but they will invariably arrive too late (i.e ., no earlier then twelve hours after the attack). DETECTION EQUIPMENT Portable and hand-held detectio n equipment for highly explosiv e, chemical, biological, and radiological materials is in sh ort supply and notoriously unrel iable in urban environments. Department of Defense and Department of Ener gy sensors deployed to local first responders"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 21 have been issued without ade quate personnel training on use and maintenance of the equipment, or guidance on what to do should the dete ction equipment register an alarm. TRAINING Major field exercises are important tools to test the adequacy of contingency plans, equipment, command-and-control procedures, and tr aining. In all but America’s largest cities, there is a paucity of resources and expertise to organize and conduc t these large scale exercises. For example, from 1996 to 1999, the federal g overnment was able to provide WMD response training to only 134,000 of the nation’s estimated nine million first responders. Furthermore, only two percent of these 134,000 responders recei ved hands-on training with live chemical agents. The Center for Domestic Preparedness in Anniston, Alabama, is the only facility in the nation where first responders can train with an d gain first-hand knowledge of chemical agents. At peak capacity, it can train only 10,000 responders per year. RECOMMENDATIONS Our nation would not send its armed forces into harm’s way without outfitting them with the right tools and skills. Our first responders and local law enforcement officers deserve the same investment—their lives and ou r lives depend on it. Therefor e, the Task Force makes the following recommendations: • Establish a twenty-four–hour operations center in each state that can provide a real time intergovernmental link between local a nd federal law enforcement. Field-level police would contact this center when they apprehend suspects to receive a red or green light to hold or release them based on a check of federal and Interpol databases. • Step up efforts to rein in identity fr aud by strengthening the anti-counterfeit safeguards in state driver’s licenses and passports, passing state laws criminalizing identity theft, and mobilizing 120-day joint local, state, and federal agency task forces to investigate and target phony identification traffickers. • Provide grants for states and cities to hi re retired first responders on ninety-day renewable contracts to conduct comprehens ive assessments on the status of urban emergency preparedness, including the state of protective gear, communications plans and equipment, and the availabi lity of chemical antidotes."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 22 • Fund the backlog of protective equipment and training requests by urban fire departments. This is a case where an imme diate infusion of res ources can make an immediate difference in reducing the risks to first responders and the morbidity and mortality of incident victims. • Fund and deploy commercial off-the-shelf technologies that can integrate multiple radio platforms to support interoperabl e communications, including the ability to coordinate the flow of voice, image, and electronic information among responding agencies. • Provide the national re search labs with adequate f unding to develop, field-test, and widely distribute new portabl e and hand-held sensor eq uipment suitable for urban environments. • Ensure that the distribution of new technologies to firs t responders is supported by training and long-term ma intenance contracts. • The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the National Guard should collaborate with state and local officials to depl oy threat-based simulation models and training modules to support lo cal emergency operati ons center training. WMD field exercises should be funded in al l the nation’s major ur ban areas over the next eighteen months. Senior police and fire officials from smaller cities and localities should be include d in these exercises. 2. M AKE T RADE S ECURITY A G LOBAL P RIORITY . “There is virtually no security for what is th e primary system to transport global trade. The consequence of a terrorist incident us ing a container would be profound. . . If terrorists used a sea container to conceal a weapon of mass destruction and detonated it on arrival at a port, the impact on global trade and the global economy could be immediate and devastating—all nations would be affected. No container ships would be allowed to unload at U.S. ports after such an event.” — Robert Bonner, Commissioner, U.S. Customs Service, August 26, 2002 Immediately following the September 11 attacks, fe deral authorities ordere d the closing of U.S. airspace to all flights, both foreign and domes tic, shut down the nation’s major seaports, and slowed truck, automobile, and pedestrian traffic across the land borders w ith Canada and Mexico"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 23 to a trickle. Nineteen men wiel ding box-cutters forced the United States to do to itself what no adversary could ever accomplis h: a successful blockade of the U.S. economy. If a surprise terrorist attack were to happen tomorrow involvi ng the sea, rail, or truck transportation systems that carry millions of tons of trade to the Unite d States each day, the response would likely be the same—a self-imposed global embargo. VULNERABLE SEAPORTS Ninety-five percent of all non-North American U.S. trade moves by sea and arrives in 361 ports around the nation. Despite the vital role seaports play in li nking America to the world, both economically and militarily, port vulnerability studi es for the nation’s fift y largest ports are not scheduled to be completed for five more years. Over the past few decades, container traffic and energy imports increasingly have been concentrat ed in just a handful of ports, making them inviting targets. For instance, forty-three percent of all the maritime containers that arrived in the United States in 2001 came through the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. As the recent West Coast port closures demonstrated, the cost to the economy of closing these ports totals approximately $1 billion per day for the first five days, rising exponentially thereafter. Nearly one-quarter of all of California’ s imported crude oil is offloaded in one geographically confined area. A USS Cole–style incident involving a ship offloading at that loca le could leave Southern California without refined fuels within just a few days. The Am erican Association of Port Authorities estimates the cost of adequate physical secu rity at the nation’s commercial seaports to be $2 billion. So far only $92.3 million in fede ral grants have been au thorized and approved. Even then, the grants have not been awarded on the basis of a port’s relative importance to the nation. The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach requested $70 million in post–September 11 grants and were awarded just $6.175 million. The ad equacy of such grant levels needs urgent reexamination. TRADE DEPENDENCY ON THE INTERMODAL CONTAINER There are an estimated eleven million containers worldwide that are loaded and unloaded ten times per year. Ninety percent of the world’s ge neral cargo moves in these boxes. The architects of the intermodal revolution in transportation never considered security as a criterion—lower transport costs and improved speed and efficiency were the driving forces. For example, a new"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 24 40’ container costs on average $2,500 to build and holds up to thirty tons of freight. The cost of the ocean voyage for a full container from Eur ope or Asia is approximately $1,500. There are no required security standards governing the loading or transport of an intermodal container. Most are “sealed” with a numbered fifty-cent, lead tag. If an explosive device was loaded in a cont ainer and set off in a port, it would almost automatically raise concern about the integrity of the 21,000 containers that arrive in U.S. ports each day and the many thousands more that arrive by truck and rail across U.S. land borders. A three-to-four-week closure of U.S. ports would bring the global container industry to its knees. Mega-ports like Rotterdam and Si ngapore would have to close their gates to prevent boxes from piling up on their limited pier space. Trucks, trai ns, and barges would be stranded outside the terminals with no way to unload their boxes. Boxe s bound for the United Stat es would have to be unloaded from their outbound ships. Service contracts would need to be renegotiated. As this system becomes gridlocked, so would much of global commerce. TRADE DEPENDENCY ON A SMALL NU MBER OF BORDER CROSSINGS The five major bridges and one tunnel that li nk Ontario to Michigan and New York account for seventy percent of all the trade between th e United States and Cana da—America’s largest trading partner. The Ambassador Bridge, between Detroit, Michigan, and Windsor, Ontario, alone carries $250 million per day, which is twenty-s even percent of the total U.S.-Canada daily trade in merchandise. When these border cro ssings were effectively closed following the September 11 attacks, many of the “big three” auto makers’ assembly plants went idle within two days (the average assembly plant produces $1 million worth of automobiles per hour). Manufacturers and retailers depend on the unimpeded cross-border flow of trade to respond to “just-in-time” delivery imperatives. Despite this dependency, the U.S. and Canadian governments provide no security to these structur es because they are eith er privately owned or controlled by binational bridge authorities. Sin ce border inspections are done after vehicles cross the bridge or emerge from the tunnel, these insp ections provide no protectiv e value for these vital trade lines. "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 25 RECOMMENDATIONS The Task Force makes the following recommendations: • Develop a layered security system that fo cuses on the entire logistics and intermodal transportation network rather th an on an unintegrated series of tactics aimed at addressing vulnerabilities at arrival ports or at already congested land borders. • Develop standards for security at loading fac ilities for an intermodal container. Require certification of these standards and periodi c independent audits for compliance as a condition for gaining access to an inte rnational transportation terminal. • Identify and test commercial off-the-shelf sensors and tracking devices to assure in- transit visibility and account ability of container movements and conduct demonstration projects using volunteer commer cial shippers to test thei r technological and commercial viability. • Improve the accuracy, timing, and format for transmitting and sharing data about the contents, location, and chain of cust ody involving a container shipment. • Accelerate the time table for th e action plans agreed to in the U.S.-Canada and U.S.- Mexico “smart-border” accords. • Work with Canada to implement adequate se curity measures for cross-border bridges and the Detroit-Windsor tunnel. • Task the U.S. Department of State, U.S. Department of Commerce, and U.S. Trade Representative to actively promote rapid adop tion of security standards governing surface and maritime transportation in bilateral and multilateral arrangements with America’s trading partners. Work to advance these st andards within appropriate international organizations such as the International St andards Organization, International Maritime Organization, and the World Customs Organization. Retrofitting security into the global trade system is not only about mitigating the ri sk of terrorists exploiting these systems to target the United States, but also about sustaining the system that underpins global commerce. "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 26 3. S ET C RITICAL I NFRASTRUCTURE P ROTECTION P RIORITIES . “We are convinced that our vulnerabilities a re increasing steadily, that the means to exploit those weaknesses are readily availabl e and that the costs associated with an effective attack continue to drop. What is more, the investments required to improve the situation—now still relatively mod est—will rise if we procrastinate.” —The Report of the President’s Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection, 1997 Our adversaries can attempt to strike anywhere, but their choice of targ et will likely not be indiscriminate. There are some targets in the Unite d States that are more high-value than others in terms of visibility and the disr uptive potential. Not all critical infrastructure is equally critical. Decisions about what warrants th e most immediate attention must be made on the basis of relative vulnerability and conseque nce. Many of the critical in frastructures that underpin our national economy and support our m odern way of life remain as vu lnerable to attack today as they were a year ago. In some instances, the U. S. government is just beginning the process of undertaking an initial inventory of these vulnera bilities. Greater attention has been paid to physical security—gates, guards, and guns—but few resources are focused on preparing to respond and restore critical syst ems should these protective meas ures fail. The Task Force reviewed the June 30, 2002, findings and reco mmendations contained within the National Academies’ report, Making the Nation Safer. The areas that the Task Force finds most worrisome include: VULNERABLE ENERGY DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS Crude oil must be refined and distributed if it is to be a meaningful source of energy. Power generation plants are worthless if the electricity cannot be tran smitted to the factories, office buildings, and households that need it to power equipment and provide lighting and climate control. An adversary intent on disrupting America’ s reliance on energy need not target oil fields in the Middle East. The infrastructure for providing energy to end us ers is concentrated, sophisticated, and largely unprotecte d. Further, some infrastructure lies offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, on the continental shelf, and within th e territories of our North American neighbors. Sixty percent of the Northeast’s refined oil products are piped from refineries in Texas and Louisiana. A coordinated attack on several key pumping stations —most of which are in remote areas, are not staffed, and possess no intrusion detection devices—could cau se mass disruption to"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 27 these flows. Nearly fifty percent of California’ s electrical supply comes from natural gas power plants and thirty percent of Ca lifornia’s natural gas comes from Canada. Compressor stations to maintain pressure cost up to $40 million each an d are located every sixty miles on a pipeline. If these compressor stations were targeted, the pipe line would be shut down for an extended period of time. A coordinated attack on a selected set of key points in th e electrical power system could result in multistate blackouts. While power might be restored in parts of the region within a matter of days or weeks, acute shortages could mandate rolling blackouts for as long as several years. Spare parts for critical components of th e power grid are in shor t supply; in many cases they must be shipped from overseas sources. VULNERABLE FOOD AND WATER SUPPLIES The nation’s food and agriculture industry repres ents a substantial sector of our economy and presents an inviting opportunity for biological attacks. As the recent foot-and-mouth disease outbreak among livestock in Great Britain illustrate d, once a diagnosis of a contagious disease is made, the effect on domestic and export markets can be devastating. Sim ilarly, there are vast numbers of pathogens that have the potential to wreak havoc on crops. Public anxieties over food contamination can undermine the demand for majo r foodstuffs for years. Yet, there is no CDC equivalent to provide a shared communications network among states and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Nor is there an effective mean s to communicate and coordinate internationally. Confusion over reporting ob ligations, who has jurisdiction, and to what extent th ey can provide adequate response to a potential attack promises to seriously compromise America’s ability to contain the consequences of a ttacks on U.S. crops and livestock. For example, one recent exercise found that by the time the Agriculture Department’s foreign-dise ase laboratory on Plum Island, N.Y., would have confirmed the first case of foot-and-mouth cros s-border contamination, the disease would likely have sp read to twenty-eight states. The system that provides Americans with a basic element of life—water—remains vulnerable to mass disruption. Wate r systems are generally owned a nd maintained by local water companies and authorities that are slow to ad opt new technologies and protocols. America’s water supply is extremely vulne rable to contamination. This pr oblem is compounded by the fact that extremely limited laboratory capacity and legal liability issues have made the routine monitoring of public water supplie s for dangerous contaminants the exception rath er than the"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 28 rule. This lack of testing and monitoring capability can compound the consequences of a localized attack since there is no means to qu ickly reassure an anxi ous public across America that their drinking water is safe once a highly publicized incident takes place. VULNERABLE CLEARINGHOUSE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT FINANCIAL MARKETS Over the past two decades, the securities a nd banking industries have moved toward relying on a small number of core organizations for thei r post–trade clearing and settlement activities. If these systems were targeted by terrorists, the c oncentrated nature of these essential services could translate into profound disr uption of daily economic life, both inside the United States and abroad. For example, clearing and settlement activities for the prop er functioning of the government securities markets are essentially ma naged by just two banks, JP Morgan Chase and the Bank of New York. These two banks each exte nd approximately $1 trillion in intraday credit to their dealer and clearing customers each day. The sudden loss of these services could create a serious liquidity problem and likely damage public confidence in America’s financial institutions and the systems upon which they borrow, invest, spend and save. RECOMMENDATIONS The Task Force makes the following recommendations: • Set critical infrastructure priorities by m oving beyond a ranking of vulnerabilities within each sector. Instead, conduct a cross-sector analysis, placing a premium on addressing vulnerabilities that present the greatest risk of cascading disr uption and losses across multiple sectors. • Fund energy distribution vulnerability assessmen ts to be completed in no more than six months. • Fund a stockpile of modular backup component s to quickly restore the operation of the energy grid should it be targeted. • Work with Canada to put in place adequate security measures for cross-border pipelines. • Bolster the capacity for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to exercise control over detection and incidence management of plant and animal disease, drawing upon the best practices developed by the Center fo r Disease Control (CDC) for managing human"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 29 disease. Task USDA with immediately bringi ng online a shared communications network to link it with states and U.S. trade partners. • Provide adequate funding to significantly e nhance USDA’s training in identifying foreign diseases and assume global leadership in devising a robust international system for monitoring the outbreak of an imal and plant disease. • Identify and remove legal liability constraint s to routinely testing public water supplies for dangerous contaminants. Acce lerate the development of adequate laboratory testing to serve local water companies and commissions. • Create common integrated communication netw orks and real-time data/software backup repositories among the clearing banks, the De pository Trust and Clearing Corporation, dealers, and other key participants in the gove rnment securities market . Routinely test for recovery and resumption operations. The goal is to ensure that there are sufficient funds and securities available to market-makers in ti mes of market stress so as to support the high level of liquidity required for trading. 4. B OLSTER P UBLIC H EALTH S YSTEMS . “Our concern is that bioterrorism prepare dness funding must be adequate, lasting, and reliable to enable local public health age ncies to build and sustain permanent improvements in their ability to protect th eir communities twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Most communities do not now have this level of protection.” —Thomas L. Milne, Executive Director National Association of County and City Health Officials, April 18, 2002 Agents used in biological attack s often require several days befo re victims start exhibiting acute symptoms. Early detection is ke y to stemming morbidity and mo rtality rates. Yet, with the possible exception of New York City, America’s urban areas lack the a dvanced public health warning systems or specialized equipment to make this determination. There are simply not enough resources available within existing state and local budgets to remedy this situation in a timely way. Most local public health departments are barely funded and staffed to run during a normal 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. work week. Medical prof essionals often lack the training to properly diagnose and treat diseases spaw ned by biological agents. Many of the states’ p ublic health reporting systems are antiquated, slow, and outmoded. It can routinely take up to three weeks for"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" 30 a public health department to register a disease in cident report in the nati onal database. And there is no consensus on which language and diagnostic coding system should be used for a national database or how to safeguard that information. Recent efforts in the federal government to re spond to the bioterrorism threat may only add to confusion over responsibility and accountability. Responsibility for direction and coordination of public health efforts should re st with a substantially bolster ed Centers for Disease Control with clear lines of communicatio n to other departments and agencies such as the National Institutes of Health. Since much of the nation’s re search and most of the tr eatment capacity lie in the private sector, outreach is essential. CHEMICAL VERSUS BIOLOGICAL ATTA CKS HAVE DIFFERENT IMPERATIVES In chemical terrorism, detecting an attack is generally not a problem. People will show symptoms immediately: vomiting, su ffering from seizures, experienci ng respiratory distress, etc. The real challenge is deciphering which antidotes are appropriate and delivering them to the victims. The window of opportunity to mitigate the consequences of these attacks is very small—between a few minutes and two hours. Detecting that there has been a biological att ack can be far more prob lematic since symptoms in a person do not show up right away. The window of opportunity fo r responding to the biological agent anthrax ranges from thirty-six to forty-eight hours and for small pox nine to eleven days. For hemorrhagic fever viruses such as Ebola, an outbrea k can range from two to twenty-one days after the attack is launched. The problem of di scerning the difference between flu-like symptoms and the onset of a deadly disease is compounded when physicians are unfamiliar with diagnosing and treating such diseas es and lack the medications to prescribe in any event. LITTLE TO NO CAPACITY TO COND UCT OUTBREAK INVESTIGATIONS Medical care providers who come in contact with victims are the first line of defense. Few of these professionals have received training on how to diagnose, treat, and report symptoms that are associated with a biological attack. Most city and county public health agencies currently lack the resources to support emergency hotlines twenty-four hours a day. Th e National Association of City and County"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 31 Health Officials estimate that localities need 10,000 to 15,000 new employ ees to work in public health preparedness functions. Given these shortage s, few localities have the ability to assemble a team to conduct an outbreak investigation. Public health laboratories cannot support a surg e in the number of tests to verify the existence of a biological agent. Seven months af ter the anthrax mailings, there was a backlog of thousands of unexamined specimens suspected of being contaminated with anthrax powder around the United States. RECOMMENDATIONS The Task Force makes the following recommendations: • Ensure that major cities and counties plan a nd train for truly catastrophic attacks. While these scenarios strike many as too horrific to contemplate, imagining and planning for them can potentially make the difference betw een a twenty percent casualty rate and an eighty percent or high er casualty rate. • Make emergency federal funding available to a ddress the highest priority state, county, and city public health needs. • Develop public health surveillance syst ems built around monitoring ambulance calls, pharmacies reporting an upsurge in the pur chase of certain ove r-the-counter drugs, corporations and schools reporting a surge in wo rker or student absenteeism, and doctors and hospitals reporting an increase in walk-in patients. • Develop and maintain call lists of retired nurses, doctors, and emergency medical technicians living in the community who can be mobilized in an emergency. Provide annual training for these nonpract icing professionals and creat e a process for activating a “good Samaritan” clause to override malpractice issues. • Identify and maintain call lists of knowledg eable experts who can au thoritatively speak to the media about nuclear, chemical, or biolog ical agents, symptoms of exposures, and recommended safeguards. Develop communicati ons strategies and prepare educational materials and media guides for radio and TV on survival fundamentals for attacks involving weapons of mass destruction. • Recruit major corporations and schools to help provide medications during an emergency. While the federal government will so on have the capability to ship antibiotics"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" 32 and vaccines from the twelve national pharmaceu tical stockpiles to urban areas within six hours, there are currently no local distribution plans to ge t these medicines to the general population. • Provide funding to hospitals to pre-wire and outfit certain common areas such as lobbies, cafeterias, and hallways to support a surge in patients. Negotiate arrangements with hotels and conference center s to provide bed space for spillover patients. 5. R EMOVE F EDERAL G OVERNMENT O BSTACLES TO P ARTNERING . Obstacles for using our most potent resources for countering catastrophic terrorism must be identified and overcome. —Committee on Science and Technology for Countering Terrorism National Research Council, June 30, 2002 The burden of preparing and responding to catastrophi c terrorist attacks lies primarily outside the federal government at the local a nd state levels and with the priv ate sector companies that own and operate much of the nation’s critical infras tructure. Most of the expertise about both the vulnerabilities and the most pract ical protective measures to save lives and avert mass societal and economic disruption rests at this level as well. The fede ral government must provide leadership by issuing the call to action, supporting forums convene d to address these issues, and supplying as much specific information as possibl e to key decision-makers on the nature of the threat. ENGAGING THE PRIVATE SECTOR The barriers to greater information-sharing be tween the public and private sector are not simply bureaucratic and cultural. Private sector leaders have legal concerns with respect to liability. They also worry about violating antitr ust laws and are appreh ensive that sensitive security information may be publicly disclosed by way of the FOIA. For their part, government agencies find it almost impossible to discuss ma tters that may involve classified security information. Protecting the public’s right to know and ensuring free and competitive markets are cornerstones of our democracy. Safeguarding classifi ed material is essential to protecting sources and methods. As a practical matter, however, the current rules confound the ability of the private sector to share information with public authorities on vulnerabilities within critical infrastructure,"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" 33 and preclude the ability of fede ral government officials to shar e anything but the most generic security and threat information. The real value of sharing information is that it can encourage efforts to develop innovative security measures that involve all the releva nt stakeholders. But in novation also generally requires the infusion of federal re sources to support research and development. Here the sense of urgency required by the homeland security mission collides with the leth argic and arcane system governing federal procurement—the Federal Acqui sition Rules (FAR). Th ese rules, which run literally into the thousa nds of pages, may be tolerable for routine government purchases, but without a more streamlined proce ss to move federal resources, ch ange will be measured in terms of years, not in the weeks and months that taking emergency measures to address our most serious vulnerabilities re quires. Also, private companies that agree to work with the public sector to assist in developing and providing security measures will require legal safeguards that appropriately reduce their liabili ty exposure. Good faith efforts to advance security should not result in a risk of bankruptcy or huge litigation costs should these measures ultimately fail to deter or prevent terrorist attacks. TAP INTERNATIONAL EXPERTISE While terrorism may be a new and painful expe rience for most Americans, regrettably many American allies such as Britain, France, Spain, and Israel have been confr onted by this challenge for some time. Countries such as Switzerland pr ovide a model for how civil defense efforts can be coordinated and largely resour ced at the national level and ad apted and managed at the local level. The United States does not have a monopoly on insight and ingenuity. It should be keen to learn from others’ experience by sending research t eams abroad to identify the best practices that could be implemented quickly here in the United States. RECOMMENDATIONS The Task Force makes the following recommendations: • Draw on private sector experts who are involved in the design and operations of critical infrastructures such as the elect ric-power grid, teleco mmunications, gas and oil, banking and finance, transportation, water supply, public h ealth services, and"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" 34 emergency services. Enlist their partic ipation to conduct government-sponsored vulnerability assessments and to participate in red-team activities. • Enact an “Omnibus Anti-Red Tape” law with a two-year sunset clause for approved private-public homeland security task forces to include: (1) a fast-track security clearance process that permits the sharing of “secret-level” classified information with non-federal and industry leaders; (2 ) a FOIA exemption in instances when critical infrastructure indust ry leaders agree to share info rmation about their security vulnerabilities with federal agencies, (3) ex emption of private participants in these task forces from antitrust rules; (4) permitting homeland security appropriations to be managed under the more liberal rules gove rning research and development programs in the Department of Defense rather th an according to the customary Federal Acquisition Rules; and (5) liab ility of safeguards and limits. • Fund and deploy survey teams in Britain, Fran ce, Spain, and Israel to conduct studies on managing urban terrorism, evaluating Euro pean airline security procedures, and examining private-public intelligence sharing arrangements. 6. F UND , T RAIN , AND E QUIP THE N ATIONAL G UARD TO M AKE H OMELAND S ECURITY A P RIMARY M ISSION . The National Guard will play a crit ical role when the next catast rophic terrorist attack happens on American soil, and it must be well trained and equipped. Governors will expect National Guard units in their states to help with det ecting chemical and biological agents, treating the victims, managing secondary cons equences, and maintaining civil order. The National Guard has highly disciplined manpower spread throughout the nation in 5,475 units. The men and women who make up its ranks often come from the loca l community in which their unit is based. When called up by governors, the National Guard can be used to enforce civil laws—unlike regular forces which are bound by posse comitatus restrictions on performi ng law enforcement duties. The National Guard’s medical units, engineer units, military police units, and ground and air transport units will likely prove indispensable in helping to manage the consequences of a terrorist attack. "},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 35 ADAPTING TO THE NEW HOMELAND SECURITY IMPERATIVE Governors, charged with de veloping state homeland securi ty plans, will look to their National Guard units to fulfill such needs as: • State-of-the-art communicati ons systems necessary for command-and-control during the chaos of a terrorist attack; • Manpower in order to evacuat e, quarantine, and protec t residents as need be; • Knowledge of chemical, biologi cal, and radiological attacks and the capability to respond to them; • The capacity to provide local medical cent ers with additional trauma and triage capabilities. The National Guard is currently equipped and tr ained primarily for carrying out its role in supporting conventional combat units overseas. The homeland s ecurity mission can draw on many of these capabilities but requires added emphasis on: • Responding to a biological attack —the National Guard’s focus in recent years has been primarily on surviving and fighting in a battlefield where chemical weapons have been deployed. • Acquiring protection, detection, an d other equipment that is tailored for complex urban environments. • Training to provide civil suppor t in the aftermath of a larg e-scale catastrophic attack. RECOMMENDATIONS An aggressive approach to revamping the cap abilities of National Guard units designated to respond to domestic terrorist attacks can in the short-term provide a more robust response capability while states and localities work to br ing their individual response mechanisms up to par. In order for the National Guard to fulfill this mission, the Task Force recommends: • Congress should authorize and fund additional training for National Guard units to work with state civil authorities and to conduct exer cises with local first responders in support of the new homeland security plan s being developed by each governor. • Triple the number of WMD-Civil Support Team s from twenty-two to sixty-six teams, develop capabilities so that response times are reduced to within the narrow window"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" 36 where their presence is still valuable, and r eevaluate equipment and training programs in order to develop response capabilities fo r the full range of WMD threats in urban environments. • Bolster the National Guard’s “train the tr ainers” programs to quickly bring baseline training on the recognition and response to WM D events to localities around the country. • Move away from using National Guard res ources where their deployment has a minimal impact. National Guardsmen are too valuable to be assigned to borders and airports where they are limited in the functions they can perform. Instead, the agencies with the mandate in these areas need to be given the necessary resources to perform their missions without National Guard help. • Redress the pay and job protec tion discrepancies between wh en National Guard units are called up by the president and when they are called up by a governor. When governors order an activation, guardsmen receive no protec tion that allows them to return to their civilian jobs as provided under the Soldiers and Sailors Civ il Relief Act.

Accordingly, aggressively pursuin g America’s homeland security imperatives immediately may well be the most important thi ng we can do to sustain our cherished freedoms for future generations. Preparedness at home also plays a critical role in combating terrorism by reducing its appeal as an effective means of warfare. Acts of catastrophic terrorism produce not only deaths and physical destruction but also soci etal and economic disruption.
