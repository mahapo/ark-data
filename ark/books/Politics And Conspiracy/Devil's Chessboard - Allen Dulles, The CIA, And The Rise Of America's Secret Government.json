No! His kind never risk their skins like that.They stay on the fringe of the plot. They are the professionals, theentrepreneurs, the links between the businessmen, the politicians who desire theend but are afraid of the means, and the fanatics, the idealists who areprepared to die for their convictions. The important thing to know about anassassination or an attempted assassination is not who fired the shot, but whopaid for the bullet.”—A COFFIN FOR DIMITRIOS, ERIC AMBLER"},{"pageContent":"CONTENTS 1.

executive producer. This book could not have been accomplishedwithout her essential contributions. It was born out of our mutual desire to getto the bottom of this darkly fascinating pool of history and to seek some typeof justice for those who escaped it or were denied it in their time. Along theway, Karen and I engaged in endless discussions and debates. She was my fellowinvestigator as we pursued sources and documents around the globe. She was thefirst to read the pages I wrote as they came out of my laptop. Through herobsessive dedication and unfailing support, I was allowed to keep those pagescoming. This book is the fruit of our partnership.Karen and I owe much to the generous assistance and intellectual camaraderie ofmany individuals, who are equally committed to enlightening the public about thecrimes and sorrows of our past. We must thank, in particular, our mentor, PeterDale Scott. It was during one of our many stimulating conversations with Peterthat the idea for this book was born. We also feel a special sense of gratitudefor the aid and fellowship of Jefferson Morley, James Lesar, Gary Aguilar,Vincent Salandria, Gerry Percy, Lawrence Meli, Adam Walinsky, Paul Schrade, LisaPease, Rex Bradford, James DiEugenio, Dick Russell, Marie Fonzi, Daniel Alcorn,Bill Simpich, Jerry Policoff, William Kelly, and Cyril and Ben Wecht.

And we express our thanks to the generous contributorsto the Open America campaign on Indiegogo.We also relied on the skillful research assistance of FrancoiseSorgen-Goldschmidt, Rhoda Newman, Margot Williams, Cliff Callahan, AntonyShugaar, Norma Tennis, and Ron Basich. We are equally indebted to the staffs ofPrinceton’s Seeley Mudd Library, where Allen Dulles’s papers are kept; Harvard’sSchlesinger Library, which houses the papers of Martha Clover Dulles and MaryBancroft; as well as the staff members of the John F. Kennedy Library, Dwight D.Eisenhower Library, the New York Public Library’s archives department, theHoover Institution, the University of California–Santa Barbara specialcollections department, and the George C. Marshall Foundation.We are among the historians plumbing the depths of U.S. intelligence andnational security, from World War II on, who have made vital discoveries bycombing through the wealth of official documents released under “sunshine laws”such as the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act and the NaziWar Crimes Disclosure Act. (Many JFK–related documents are archived at theessential Mary Ferrell Foundation website.) The American people have only gainedaccess to this hidden history as a result of concerted political pressure, andagencies such as the CIA still remain defiantly opposed to fully disclosing theinformation they are required to under federal law. As the tyrannical regime inOrwell’s 1984 understood, “Who controls the past controls the future.” It isessential that we continue to fight for the right to own our history.In addition to archival and documentary research, we also learned much frominterviewing the sons and daughters, as well as former colleagues, of thesecretive men who are the subject of this book. We are especially thankful toJoan Talley, the daughter of Allen Dulles, though she bears no responsibilityfor our views.Authors who put the products of their hard labors in the hands of editors oftendo so with the trepidation of parents who place their offspring in the hands ofsurgeons. It was, therefore, an enormous joy and relief—after entrusting thisbook to Jennifer Barth at HarperCollins—to witness the delicate precision of hereditorial hand. She earned my trust and respect, page by page.I am also indebted to my longtime agent, Sloan Harris of ICM, for his soundjudgment, levelheaded demeanor, and keen literary and business sense.Thanks once again to the indomitable Kelly Frankeny for her cover-designwizardry, as well as to Robert Newman.And last—but far, far from least—I celebrate my wife, Camille Peri.

They seemed particularly strange coming from the genial oldergentleman strolling by Willie Morris’s side. In fact, they were the onlystrident remarks that Morris had heard him utter in the past few days, as thegraying spymaster regaled his young visitor with a lifetime of covertadventures.And then the storm passed. The man was himself again—the chatty and amiableAllen Welsh Dulles, a man whose conviviality masked a world of dark secrets. Thetwo men continued their walk on that Indian summer evening in 1965, amblingalong the rust-colored brick sidewalks as the lampposts began casting theiryellow light on picturesque Georgetown—home of Washington hostesses,martini-loving spies, influential newspapermen, and the assorted insiders whofed off the fizz and sizzle of the nation’s capital. Turning the corner from theunassuming, two-story brick mansion on Q Street that Dulles rented, they nowfound themselves on R Street, straddling the vast greenery of the Dumbarton Oaksestate.Dulles, the creator of America’s sprawling intelligence empire, had summonedMorris—a rising young editor at Harper’s magazine—to help him set the recordstraight on the most cutting humiliation of his career. He wanted to write hisside of the story about the Bay of Pigs. The words alone still brought a spasmof pain and rage to Dulles’s face. It was just a spit of sand and scrubby palmsalong Cuba’s southern coast. But it was the scene, in April 1961, of the biggestdisaster in the CIA’s history—a motley invasion that fell ignominiously short oftoppling Cuba’s dangerously charismatic leader, Fidel Castro. The failedinvasion, Dulles said, was “the blackest day of my life.”In public, the newly minted president, John F. Kennedy, took responsibility forthe fiasco and made gracious remarks about Dulles as he prepared to usher theaging spy out the door, after a half century of public service encompassingeight different presidencies. But in private, a vicious war had begun betweenthe Kennedy and Dulles camps, with the two men and their advocates working thepress and arguing not just the botched mechanics of the invasion, but the pastand future of U.S. foreign policy.The Bay of Pigs came after a long string of Dulles victories. Given free rein byPresident Eisenhower to police the world against any insurgent threat to U.S.dominion, Dulles’s CIA overthrew nationalist governments in Africa, LatinAmerica, and the Middle East, and even targeted troublesome leaders in alliedEuropean countries. Dulles called himself “the secretary of state for unfriendlycountries”—which had an ominous ring when one took note of what happened tounfriendly countries in the American Century. Meanwhile, his brother John FosterDulles—Eisenhower’s official secretary of state—brought the gloom of adoomsday-obsessed vicar to his job, with his frequent sermons on Communistperfidy and his constant threats of nuclear annihilation. John Foster Dullesneeded Communism the way that Puritans needed sin, the infamous British doubleagent Kim Philby once remarked. With his long, dour face topped by hisever-present banker’s homburg, the elder Dulles always seemed to be on the brinkof foreclosing on all human hope and happiness.By 1959, John Foster Dulles was rapidly succumbing to stomach cancer. It was asif the bile building up inside him all those years over the fallen state of theworld had finally devoured him. And by then Eisenhower himself washeart-troubled and weary of his job. Only Allen Dulles still stood firmly at thetop, past retirement age at sixty-six, but still determined that the ancientregime must continue.When President Kennedy began his vigorous new reign in 1961, he decided to keepAllen Dulles as CIA chief, despite the obvious differences in their worldoutlooks. With his brush mustache, wire-rim glasses, tweed suits, and belovedpipe, Dulles could have been one of the elderly dons that young Jack Kennedy hadstudied under at Harvard. As a young senator, JFK had broken from theEisenhower-Dulles regime over the older men’s nuclear brinksmanship—a game thatKennedy felt courted the abyss. Kennedy had also signaled an eagerness todramatically change America’s hostile relationship to the developing world,expressing a sympathy for the national liberation movements in Algeria, theCongo, Vietnam, and elsewhere that he saw as historically inevitable. WhilePresident Eisenhower viewed the onrush of anticolonial independence in the ThirdWorld as a “destructive hurricane,” Kennedy recognized it as the future.Though their visions for how the United States should navigate the globe wereprofoundly far apart, Kennedy was loath to completely overturn the old rulingorder that had been presided over by a popular World War II hero. KeepingEisenhower men like Dulles and other Republican pillars of power like WallStreet banker and statesman C. Douglas Dillon, whom JFK named his Treasurysecretary, was the new president’s way of assuring the nation that he would beleading an orderly transition to the New Frontier. But Kennedy soon realizedthat when it came to men like Dulles, his political calculation was a gravemistake.Allen Dulles was one of the wiliest masters of secret power ever produced byAmerica. And his most ambitious clandestine efforts were directed not againsthostile governments but against his own. While serving in multiple presidentialadministrations, he learned to manipulate them and sometimes subvert them.In the view of the Dulles brothers, democracy was an enterprise that had to becarefully managed by the right men, not simply left to elected officials as apublic trust. From their earliest days on Wall Street—where they ran Sullivanand Cromwell, the most powerful corporate law firm in the nation—theiroverriding commitment was always to the circle of accomplished, privileged menwhom they saw as the true seat of power in America. Although Foster and Allendid not come from the same wealthy families who dominated this elite club, thebrothers’ shrewd talents, missionary drive, and powerful connections firmlyestablished them as top executives in this rarefied world.As younger men, the Dulles brothers were obsessive chess players. When theyfaced each other over a chessboard, everything else faded away. Even during hiswhirlwind courtship of Martha Clover Todd, a free-spirited beauty from aprominent family to whom he proposed after a three-day siege, Allen could not bedistracted from a lengthy joust with his brother. The Dulleses would bring thesame strategic fixation to the game of global politics.John Foster Dulles would rise to become the chief counsel for American power, aman destined to quietly confer with kings, prime ministers, and despots. Heliked to think of himself as chess master of the free world. His younger brotherwould become something more powerful still—the knight-errant who enforcedAmerica’s imperial will. As director of the CIA, Allen Dulles liked to think hewas the hand of the king, but if so, he was the left hand—the sinister hand. Hewas master of the dark deeds that empires require.The Dulles brothers were not intimidated by mere presidents. When PresidentFranklin Roosevelt pushed through New Deal legislation to restrain the rampantgreed and speculation that had brought the country to economic ruin, John FosterDulles simply gathered his corporate clients in his Wall Street law office andurged them to defy the president. “Do not comply,” he told them. “Resist the lawwith all your might, and soon everything will be all right.”Later, when Allen Dulles served as the United States’ top spy in continentalEurope during World War II, he blatantly ignored Roosevelt’s policy ofunconditional surrender and pursued his own strategy of secret negotiations withNazi leaders. The staggering sacrifice made by the Russian people in the waragainst Hitler meant little to Dulles. He was more interested in salvaging theThird Reich’s security apparatus and turning it against the Soviet Union—whichhe had always regarded as America’s true enemy. After the war, Dulles helped anumber of notorious war criminals escape via the “Nazi ratlines” that ran fromGermany, down through Italy, to sanctuary in Latin America, the Middle East, andeven the United States.Allen Dulles outmaneuvered and outlived Franklin Roosevelt. He stunned HarryTruman, who signed the CIA into existence in 1947, by turning the agency into aCold War colossus far more powerful and lethal than anything Truman hadimagined. Eisenhower gave Dulles immense license to fight the administration’sshadow war against Communism, but at the end of his presidency, Ike concludedthat Dulles had robbed him of his place in history as a peacemaker and left himnothing but “a legacy of ashes.” Dulles undermined or betrayed every presidenthe served in high office.Dulles would serve John F. Kennedy for less than a year, but their brieflyentwined stories would have monumental consequences. Clearly outmatched in thebeginning by the savvy spymaster, who beguiled Kennedy into the Bay of Pigsdisaster, JFK proved a quick learner in the Washington power games. He becamethe first and only president who dared to strip Dulles of his formidableauthority. But Dulles’s forced retirement did not last long after Kennedyjettisoned him from the CIA in November 1961. Instead of easing into histwilight years, Dulles continued to operate as if he were still America’sintelligence chief, targeting the president who had ended his illustriouscareer. The underground struggle between these two icons of power is nothingless than the story of the battle for American democracy.Walking through Georgetown on that warm September evening, Willie Morris wasperplexed to hear Dulles erupt with such scorn at the mere mention of Kennedy’sname. But there was a reason that—nearly two years after JFK’s bloodyend—Kennedy’s hold on the public’s imagination still disturbed Dulles. He knewwho the real “god” was—and it was not Jack Kennedy.After their stroll, the two men returned to Dulles’s home for drinks and dinner,and then more work on his article, which was to be titled “My Answer to the Bayof Pigs.” There was a sad stillness to the Dulles residence: Clover was away, atthe family’s summer retreat on Lake Ontario; their son, Allen Jr., a brilliantyoung man who had suffered a grievous head wound in the Korean War, was in andout of sanitariums; their grown daughters Joan and Toddie had their own worriesand misfortunes. There was nothing to distract Morris and Dulles besides thefleeting presence of one or two servants. Morris proved a good companion, a sonof Mississippi who knew how to keep up his end when the bourbon and conversationbegan flowing. And he was the most touted magazine editor of his generation, onhis way to becoming the youngest editor of the venerable Harper’s at agethirty-two. Under his leadership in the late ’60s, Harper’s would glow with thevibrant writing of Norman Mailer, William Styron, and David Halberstam.But, in the end, even with Morris’s expert hand, Dulles could not wrestle hismanuscript into shape, and the old spook withdrew it from publication. By thetime Dulles finally gave up, after months of toil, the article had gone throughmultiple drafts, adding up to several hundred coffee-stained pages. The drafts,now stuffed into boxes at a Princeton library where the Dulles papers arehoused, are a window into Allen Dulles’s tortured relationship with the youngpresident. In finally abandoning the massive project, which one historian latercalled “The ‘Confessions’ of Allen Dulles,” the old spymaster seemed to concludethat he was saying both too much and too little about what he had been throughwith Kennedy.By writing the article, Dulles had set out to rebut charges made by JFKloyalists Theodore Sorensen and Arthur Schlesinger Jr. that Kennedy had beentricked by his intelligence advisers into the disastrous Cuban adventure. Butinstead, the spymaster’s scribblings—in between angry eruptions at Kennedy andhis White House circle of “doubting Thomases” and “Castro admirers”—revealed themyriad ways that Dulles’s CIA had indeed contrived to lure the young presidentinto the Cuban sand trap.When the Bay of Pigs operation was under way and “the chips were down,” Dulleswrote, he was confident that JFK would be compelled to do the right thing andsend in the awesome power of the U.S. military to rescue the invasion. That’sthe way the CIA game was played: there was a certain amount of hoodwinking andmassaging of White House anxieties, and then the president fell in line. Butthis time, the president, despite his youth and the collective browbeating ofhis gray-haired national security ministers, stood his ground. Kennedy said noto expanding an operation that he had felt all along was sordid. And the longreign of Allen Dulles came crashing down.At least, that’s the way Dulles’s story is told in biographies and CIAhistories. The truth is that Dulles’s reign went on, deeply cloaked, toward aneven more catastrophic conclusion.In the first days and weeks after his ouster, Dulles’s world caved in. Suddenlyunmoored from the daily routines of power he had known ever since he was abudding young spy in the service of Woodrow Wilson, Dulles seemed “a very tragicman,” in the words of one CIA colleague. He shuffled around his Georgetown home,with his gout-ridden feet softly coffined in bedroom slippers. But Dulles’s“tragic” period did not last long. He soon began meeting with a surprising rangeof CIA officers—men from the top rungs of the agency, as well as agents from thefield. They paraded in and out of the brick manor on Q Street, huddling with himin his book-lined study and on sunny days quietly chatting on his walled-interrace. His day calendar was filled with yet more meetings at his favoriteWashington retreats, the Alibi Club and the Metropolitan Club, where he dinedwith the same generals and national security wise men with whom he had donebusiness at the CIA. It was, in fact, as if he had never left the spy agency.Dulles would turn his Georgetown home into the center of an anti-Kennedygovernment in exile. As time went by, the Dulles circle became ever moredisenchanted with JFK’s foreign policy, which they considered appeasement of theCommunist enemy. Dulles grew bolder in his opposition. He met with acontroversial Cuban exile leader named Paulino Sierra Martinez, a formerhenchman for the deposed dictator Fulgencio Batista. Sierra, whose anti-Castroactivities were underwritten by the Mafia and U.S. corporations with a stake inCuba, later fell under Secret Service suspicion in a conspiracy againstPresident Kennedy. The topic of Sierra’s meeting with Dulles in April 1963remains a mystery.By October 1963, Dulles felt confident enough to speak out against Kennedy’sforeign policy in public, ignoring the Washington etiquette that deemed it badform to criticize a president whom you recently had served. Dulles declared thatthe Kennedy presidency suffered from a “yearning to be loved by the rest of theworld.” This “weakness” was not the mark of a global power, insisted Dulles. “Ishould much prefer to have people respect us than to try to make them love us.”In the weeks leading up to the assassination of President Kennedy on November22, 1963, the flurry of meetings at Dulles’s home intensified. Among the CIA mencoming in and out of Q Street were several who later came under investigation bythe House Select Committee on Assassinations and other probes for their possibleconnection to the president’s murder. And on the weekend of the assassination,Dulles hunkered down for unexplained reasons at a secret CIA facility innorthern Virginia known as “the Farm,” despite the fact that he had been removedfrom the agency two years earlier. Such was the odd swirl of activity around the“retired” Dulles.After Kennedy’s assassination, Dulles would again push himself into theWashington spotlight, lobbying President Lyndon Johnson to appoint him to theWarren Commission. Dulles was so actively involved in the official investigationof Kennedy’s murder that one observer remarked it should have been called theDulles Commission. He worked carefully behind the scenes with his former CIAcolleagues to steer the inquiry away from the agency itself and toward “lonegunman” Lee Harvey Oswald.How did a bitter political enemy of President Kennedy wind up playing a leadrole in the official investigation into his death? It was just one more mysteryin a lifetime full of enigmatic twists and turns. Just as puzzling is why theAmerican press never troubled itself to explore this intriguing question.Over half a century later, many questions about JFK’s violent end remain“unspeakable,” in the words of Kennedy biographer James W. Douglass—at least inthe carefully controlled arena of media discourse. It is even more unthinkablein these circles to explore the suspicion that Allen Dulles himself—a toweringpillar of the U.S. establishment—might have played a role in the epic crimeagainst U.S. democracy that took place in Dallas. But this is just one of manytaboo and top secret areas of Dulles’s life explored in this book.The Allen Dulles story continues to haunt the country. Many of the practicesthat still provoke bouts of American soul-searching originated during Dulles’sformative rule at the CIA. Mind control experimentation, torture, politicalassassination, extraordinary rendition, massive surveillance of U.S. citizensand foreign allies—these were all widely used tools of the Dulles reign.Dulles was capable of great personal cruelty, to his intimates as well as hisenemies. Underneath his twinkly-eyed personality was an icy amorality. “Ourfaults did not often give us a sense of guilt,” remarked Eleanor Dulles, whofollowed her two brothers into the Washington arena. Allen was less troubled byguilt or self-doubt than any of his siblings. He liked to tell people—and it wasalmost a boast—that he was one of the few men in Washington who could sendpeople to their deaths.But Dulles was not a rash man; he was coldly calculating. As the chairman ofcloak-and-dagger America, he would never initiate a high-stakes operation unlesshe felt he had the support of the principal members of his “board”—theWashington and Wall Street men of influence who quietly dominated the nation’sdecision-making.What follows is an espionage adventure that is far more action-packed andmomentous than any spy tale with which readers are familiar. This is a historyof secret power in America.We often forget how fragile a creation democracy is—a delicate eggshell in therough-and-tumble of history. Even in the cradle of democracy, ancient Athens,rule by the people could barely survive for a couple of centuries. Andthroughout its brief history, Athenian democracy was besieged from within by theforces of oligarchy and tyranny. There were plots led by generals to imposemilitary rule. There were secret clubs of aristocrats who hired squads ofassassins to kill popular leaders. Terror reigned during these convulsions, andcivil society was too intimidated to bring the assassins to justice. Democracy,Thucydides tells us, was “cowed in mind.”Our country’s cheerleaders are wedded to the notion of American exceptionalism.But when it comes to the machinations of power, we are all too similar to othersocieties and ones that have come before us. There is an implacable brutality topower that is familiar throughout the world and throughout history. And nomatter where power rules, there is the same determination by those in highplaces to keep their activities hidden.The Devil’s Chessboard seeks to shine a torch down the well of “deep politics,”as Peter Dale Scott—an important scholar of American power—has termed thisunderworld of unaccountable authority. Until we have a full reckoning of theDulles era and its high crimes, the country cannot find its way forward.In the course of researching this book, I came to know Joan Talley, one of thethree children of Allen Dulles. When we met in her Santa Fe cottage, in a roomcluttered with books and artifacts, Joan was nearing ninety and, after a longcareer as a Jungian therapist, devoting herself to editing the searinglyintimate diaries of her mother. Our conversations at times took on a therapeuticcharacter, as we wrestled with the painful legacy of her father and, morebroadly, the American soul. In an effort to understand her family, and her ownlife, Joan had delved deeply into the historical literature on the Cold War andthe CIA. She had read all about the coups and trench coat mayhem. “It seems wejust went wild,” she told me. “And the CIA was leading the way.”But as she pored through her mother’s diaries, Joan also was seeking a deeperunderstanding of her father than mere history can provide. One afternoon, sheinvoked Jung’s Red Book, the master’s night journey into his own tortured soul.“Jung says you must embrace the dark, as well as the light, to understand life,”remarked Joan, sitting in the passenger seat as I drove her dusty Prius throughNew Mexico’s high-desert chaparral.The next morning, we spoke again over the phone. Joan was still agitated by ourconversations about her father the previous day. She was trying to make sense ofhow she could have been so oblivious to this violent rush of history as ayounger woman, even when it roared right through her own living room.“Life sweeps you along—you see people floating by. Everyone is so busy and inthe moment. It’s only later that you realize what happened and how alarming itall was. You read books and you finally try to put it all together, and youdon’t know what to believe.“But it’s very important to understand it all—the dark and the light.”"},{"pageContent":"PART I [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-5]"},{"pageContent":"1 [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-6]THE DOUBLE AGENT [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-6]Allen Dulles went to war on November 9, 1942, crossing into neutral Switzerlandfrom Vichy France, just minutes before the Nazis closed the border. He latertold the story of his border crossing with pulse-racing, dramatic flair. But, inreality, it went surprisingly smoothly, especially considering theforty-nine-year-old Wall Street lawyer’s high international profile. Afterpresenting his passport to the French gendarme at the border station nearGeneva, Dulles paced the train platform while the policeman made a phone call toVichy authorities. Then, after a hovering Gestapo agent convenientlydisappeared, the gendarme obligingly waved Dulles through. It was almost as ifDulles was expected.There was nothing undercover about Allen Dulles’s wartime exploits inSwitzerland. Afterward, he made much of his espionage adventures, with asympathetic press and then equally credulous biographers dutifully repeating hisbeguiling tales. But, in truth, there was little daring involved—for a verysimple reason. Dulles was more in step with many Nazi leaders than he was withPresident Roosevelt. Dulles not only enjoyed a professional and socialfamiliarity with many members of the Third Reich’s elite that predated the war;he shared many of these men’s postwar goals. While serving in his Swiss outpost,Dulles might have been encircled by Nazi forces, but he was also surrounded byold friends.After crossing the border, Dulles wasted no time in settling into Bern, thescenic Swiss capital where he had begun his espionage career a quarter centuryearlier as a junior member of the U.S. legation during World War I. The medievalcity—built on cliffs overlooking the glacial-green Aar River, as it flowed downfrom the white-capped Alpine peaks on the horizon—held a treasure of memories.During the earlier war, there had been embassy parties and rounds of tennis—withballs arriving in diplomatic pouches from back home, courtesy of his brotherFoster. There was an international parade of mistresses—young secretaries fromthe consulates that filled the city’s diplomatic quarter as well asfree-spirited women from the local art colony. He met his conquests for drinksand pleasure at the Bellevue Palace Hotel, the elegant Art Nouveau fortress thatdominated the Old City’s skyline. Dulles affected the look of a dashingContinental cavalry officer in those days, with a waxed mustache, slim waistjacket, and high starched collar.One of his affairs during the First World War had a brutal ending. She was ayoung Czech patriot who worked alongside Dulles in the U.S. legation offices.British agents concluded that she was using her position to pass information toexiled Czech leader Jan Masaryk as well as to the Germans. When the Britishconfronted Dulles with their suspicions, the ambitious young diplomat knew hewas in an awkward spot, and he quickly complied with their plans. One nightDulles took the woman to dinner, and afterward he strolled with her along thecobblestone streets to an agreed-upon location, where he handed her over to twoBritish agents. She disappeared forever.When Dulles returned to Bern in 1942 for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS),America’s World War II spy agency, he set up his base of operations in hisresidence—the ground-floor apartment of a handsomely renovatedfourteenth-century mansion at 23 Herrengasse, near the city’s majesticcathedral. Dulles later insisted that he had carefully chosen the location withsecurity in mind, since the street ended in a cul-de-sac. He prevailed uponmunicipal authorities to extinguish the lamplight outside his building, givinglate-night visitors a measure of anonymity as they slipped in and out. Guestsseeking more confidentiality could enter Dulles’s apartment from the rear,climbing an ancient flight of stone steps that rose steeply to his back terracefrom the grape arbors and dark river below.But all this cloak and dagger was a bit of a charade. As soon as Dulles showedup in Bern, his arrival was reported in one of Switzerland’s leading newspapers,which announced him—to the spy’s great delight—as “the personal representativeof President Roosevelt.” This afforded Dulles a status that would be very usefulas he pursued his various intrigues.After arriving at 23 Herrengasse with such great fanfare, Dulles found himselfunder intense scrutiny. Although the newly arrived American spy had enjoyed longfriendships with many in the enemy camp, each side trusted the other only up toa point. From across the street, Nazi agents kept close watch on the Dullesresidence twenty-four hours a day. The Germans also infiltrated his staff—hiscook turned out to be a spy and his janitor stole carbon copies of his documentsout of his trash. Meanwhile, Swiss intelligence agents, who worked closely withtheir Nazi counterparts, eavesdropped on Dulles’s phone conversations. There waslittle that was secret about the American spy’s life in Bern.None of this seemed to disturb Dulles, who wandered openly through the streetsof Bern in a rumpled raincoat and a fedora cocked carelessly on the back of hishead. He did not have a bodyguard and he did not carry a gun. He met openly withinformers and double agents in cafés and on the city streets. “Too much secrecycan be self-defeating,” he observed.This strategy of hiding in plain sight did not make much sense from an espionagepoint of view. And it confounded and angered Dulles’s counterparts in the localoffice of MI6, the British spy agency, who dismissed the American as a rankamateur. But Dulles was involved in something far more ambitious than mere spygames. He was running his own foreign policy.William “Wild Bill” Donovan, director of the OSS, originally wanted to stationDulles in London. But Dulles insisted on Bern and he prevailed. Donovan was alegend—a World War I combat hero and self-made Wall Street millionaire lawyerwho had charmed FDR and outmaneuvered powerful rivals like J. Edgar Hoover tobuild the country’s first international intelligence agency. Undaunted byWashington bureaucracy, Donovan had recruited an impressively eclectic array oftalent for his new spy agency—from Ivy League adventurers and society girls tosafecrackers and professional killers. But Dulles, who moved in the same socialcircles as Donovan and competed aggressively with him on the tennis court, wasnot awed by his boss. He thought he could do a better job than Donovan ofrunning the show. Dulles knew that the isolated splendor of Bern would affordhim free rein to operate as he chose, with only tenuous supervision from backhome.Dulles also positioned himself in Bern because the Swiss capital was the centerof wartime financial and political intrigue. Bern was an espionage bazaar,teeming with spies, double agents, informers, and peddlers of secrets. And, asDulles knew, Switzerland was a financial haven for the Nazi war machine.The Swiss demonstrated that they were masters of duplicity during the war. Banksin Zurich and Basel allowed the Nazis to stash the treasure they were lootingfrom Europe in secret accounts, which Germany then used to buy the essentialproducts from neutral countries that fueled the Third Reich—tungsten from Spain,oil from Romania, steel from Sweden, beef from Argentina. Swiss bankers promisedthe Allies that they would block Germany’s stolen assets, but all the while theyreaped huge profits from their behind-the-scenes deals with the Nazi Reichsbank.Dulles knew many of the central players in the secretive Swiss financial milieubecause he and his brother had worked with them as clients or business partnersbefore the war. Sullivan and Cromwell, the Dulles brothers’ Wall Street lawfirm, was at the center of an intricate international network of banks,investment firms, and industrial conglomerates that rebuilt Germany after WorldWar I. Foster, the law firm’s top executive, grew skilled at structuring thecomplex merry-go-round of transactions that funneled massive U.S. investmentsinto German industrial giants like the IG Farben chemical conglomerate and KruppSteel. The profits generated by these investments then flowed to France andBritain in the form of war reparations, and then back to the United States topay off war loans.Foster Dulles became so deeply enmeshed in the lucrative revitalization ofGermany that he found it difficult to separate his firm’s interests from thoseof the rising economic and military power—even after Hitler consolidated controlover the country in the 1930s. Foster continued to represent German cartels likeIG Farben as they were integrated into the Nazis’ growing war machine, helpingthe industrial giants secure access to key war materials. He donated money toAmerica First, the campaign to keep the United States out of the gatheringtempest in Europe, and helped sponsor a rally honoring Charles Lindbergh, thefair-haired aviation hero who had become enchanted by Hitler’s miraculousrevival of Germany. Foster refused to shut down the Berlin office of Sullivanand Cromwell—whose attorneys were forced to sign their correspondence “HeilHitler”—until his partners (including Allen), fearful of a public relationsdisaster, insisted he do so. When Foster finally gave in—at an extremely tense1935 partners’ meeting in the firm’s lavish offices at 48 Wall Street—he brokedown in tears.Foster still could not bring himself to cut off his former Berlin law partner,Gerhardt Westrick, when he showed up in New York in August 1940 to lobby onbehalf of the Third Reich. Setting himself up in an opulent Westchester Countyestate, Westrick invited influential New York society types for weekend parties,taking the opportunity to subject them to his pro-Hitler charm offensive.Westrick’s guest lists were dominated by oil executives because he wasparticularly keen on ensuring the continued flow of fuel supplies to Germany,despite the British embargo. The lobbyist finally went too far—even by thehospitable standards of the New York society set—when he had the gall to throw agala party at the Waldorf-Astoria on June 26, 1940, to celebrate the Nazi defeatof France. Westrick’s shameless audacity created an uproar in the New Yorkpress, but Foster rushed to the Nazi promoter’s defense, insisting he had “ahigh regard for his integrity.”Until late in the day, Foster harbored sympathy for the devil himself, AdolfHitler. Even after the Nazi regime pushed through the anti-Semitic NurembergLaws of 1935 and unleashed waves of terror against Germany’s Jewish population,Foster clung to a sympathetic view of the Führer. He could not help beingimpressed by a man “who from humble beginnings . . . has attained theunquestioned leadership of a great nation,” Foster told a friend in 1937. By1939, Eustace Seligman—a Jewish senior partner at Sullivan and Cromwell—hadbecome so fed up with Foster’s position on Nazi Germany that he confronted hisboss, telling Foster he was hurting the firm’s reputation by publicly suggesting“that Germany’s position is morally superior to that of the Allies.”Like his brother, Allen Dulles was slow to grasp the malevolence of Hitler’sregime. Dulles met face-to-face with Hitler in the Führer’s Berlin office inMarch 1933. He was ostensibly on a fact-finding mission to Europe for PresidentRoosevelt, but Dulles was particularly interested in determining what Hitler’srise meant for his law firm’s corporate clients in Germany and the UnitedStates. As Dulles subsequently informed Foster, he did not find Hitlerparticularly alarming. And he was “rather impressed” with Joseph Goebbels,remarking on the Nazi propaganda chief’s “sincerity and frankness.” After Dullesand fellow U.S. statesman Norman Davis returned to the Adlon, their luxury hotelacross from the Brandenburg Gate, Davis was unnerved to find the word “Juden”scrawled crudely on the door of his room, even though he was not Jewish. “Theconditions are not quite as bad” as anxious reports about Hitler would indicate,Dulles nonetheless wrote Foster from Germany.By the late 1930s, Dulles’s views finally shifted and he came to dismiss Nazileaders as “those mad people in control in Germany.” He grew increasinglycertain that the United States must prepare for an inevitable showdown withHitler. But, out of deference to Foster, Allen was reluctant to make hisopinions public. He also continued to do business with the Nazi financial andindustrial network, joining the board of J. Henry Schroder Bank, the U.S.subsidiary of a London bank that Time magazine in 1939 called “an economicbooster of the Rome-Berlin Axis.” And Allen and his wife, Clover, continued tosocialize with the Lindberghs, who were their neighbors on Long Island’s GoldCoast shore. (Lindbergh, enamored of Hitler, noted in his diary that he andDulles “have somewhat similar views in a number of instances.”)Even after Dulles was recruited into the OSS by Donovan in October 1941, hisloyalties were still questioned by some administration officials, includingRoosevelt himself. Dulles’s various financial connections to the Nazi regimeprompted FDR to place the Wall Street lawyer under close surveillance when hebegan working in the OSS’s thirty-sixth-floor suite in Rockefeller Center.Monitoring Dulles proved an easy task since he shared office space with amassive British spy operation run by legendary Canadian secret agent WilliamStephenson, who would become famous as the “Man Called Intrepid.” At one point,Stephenson’s Rockefeller Center operation—which was tucked away under thecolorless name British Security Coordination—grew to as many as three thousandemployees. It was a remarkably ambitious covert enterprise, particularlyconsidering that England was operating on friendly soil.Stephenson had been sent to the United States in 1940 by his enthusiasticpatron, Winston Churchill—Britain’s newly elected prime minister—after theevacuation of British forces from the beaches of Dunkirk. With Hitler’s forcesoverrunning Europe and turning their gaze toward an increasingly isolatedEngland, Churchill knew that his nation’s only hope was to maneuver the UnitedStates into the war. Roosevelt was a strong supporter of the British cause, butwith as much as 80 percent of the American public against entering the Europeanwar and Congress equally opposed, both FDR and Churchill realized it would takea major propaganda offensive to sway the nation.The British government and the Roosevelt White House faced not only a deeplywary American public with understandable concerns about the costs of war, but awell-financed appeasement lobby with strong links to Nazi Germany. With the fateof nations at stake, the shadow war in America grew increasingly ruthless.Churchill made it clear that he was quite willing to engage in what heeuphemistically called “ungentlemanly warfare” to save his nation—and he enjoyedRoosevelt’s firm support.Stephenson—Britain’s point man in the underground war against Nazi Germany onAmerican soil—was a suave operator, with a flair for hosting lively cocktailparties at his penthouse suite in midtown Manhattan’s Dorset Hotel. But, likeJames Bond—the fictional spy partly modeled on Stephenson by his colleague IanFleming—Stephenson was also willing to do the dirty work of espionage. The slim,slight Stephenson, who arrived in New York at the age of forty-four, had thespringy step of the boxer he once was—and the smooth self-assurance of theself-made millionaire he had become. He proved an adept practitioner of theblack arts of espionage, working his far-flung press contacts in America toexpose Nazi front companies—including some of the Dulles brothers’ corporateclients—and pressuring Washington to deport Nazi lobbyists. Stephenson’soperatives also undertook a variety of black-bag operations, such as breakinginto the Spanish embassy in Washington, where they stole the secret codes fordiplomatic messages flowing between General Francisco Franco’s fascistgovernment and Berlin.Stephenson was even authorized to kill members of the Nazi network in the UnitedStates—including German agents and pro-Hitler American businessmen—using Britishassassination teams. One of the men considered for elimination was none otherthan Dulles business partner Gerhardt Westrick. (The big-spending Hitlerlobbyist was eventually simply deported.) It was this decidedly ungentlemanlyStephenson tactic that inspired Fleming to grant his hero “the license to kill.”Fleming was a great admirer of Stephenson, whom he called “a magneticpersonality” and “one of the great secret agents” of World War II. The novelist,who worked with Stephenson’s operation as a British naval intelligence agent inWashington, also praised the spymaster’s martinis—which he served in quartglasses—as “the most powerful in America.” But as Fleming himself observed, evenhis fictional hero James Bond was “not in fact a hero—but an efficient and notvery attractive blunt instrument in the hands of government.”Years later, when James Jesus Angleton and William K. Harvey—two legends of U.S.counterintelligence—were searching for assassins to kill Cuban leader FidelCastro, they sought advice from a British colleague named Peter Wright. “Haveyou thought of approaching Stephenson?” Wright suggested. “A lot of theold-timers say he ran this kind of thing in New York during the war.”President Roosevelt was well aware that the Dulleses were at the center of WallStreet and Republican Party opposition to his presidency. The brothers, as toplegal advisers to America’s business royalty, were the very symbols of the“plutocracy” that the president railed against when giving vent to his populistpassions. The fact that they were also linked to Nazi financial interests onlydeepened Roosevelt’s suspicions.While FDR himself was adept at hiding his true political feelings behind a maskof charm, there were some New Deal loyalists who openly expressed the deepenmity between the Roosevelt and Dulles camps. One such firebrand was William O.Douglas, the progressive young lawyer President Roosevelt put in charge of theSecurities and Exchange Commission, the newly formed Wall Street watchdogagency, and later appointed a justice of the Supreme Court. As FDR’s top WallStreet regulator, Douglas had more than one occasion to cross swords withFoster. Years later, Douglas’s hatred for the “unctuous and self-righteous”senior Dulles brother still reverberated in the New Dealer’s memoir. Fostercarried himself like a “high churchman,” observed Douglas. But in reality, hewas the kind of “predatory” Wall Street shill “who for a fee would stand foralmost anything.” If the John Foster Dulleses of America were destined forheaven—as men of his ilk were always utterly certain—then Douglas would ratherend up in hell. “I could perhaps endure [men like Foster] for an evening. But tosit on a cloud with [them] through eternity would be to exact too great aprice.”Though FDR shared the Dulles crowd’s privileged background, the president feltmuch more in tune with men like Douglas, the product of a hardscrabble childhoodin Washington’s Yakima Valley, where he had grown up picking fruit to helpsupport his family. Brilliant and hard-driven, Douglas worked his way throughColumbia University Law School. One of the talented law school graduate’s firstjob interviews was with Foster Dulles at Sullivan and Cromwell. But Foster wasso “pontifical” that Douglas decided against joining the firm. “In fact,” herecalled, “I was so struck by [Foster’s] pomposity that when he helped me onwith my coat, as I was leaving his office, I turned and gave him a quarter tip.”After joining the Roosevelt administration at the age of thirty-five, Douglasquickly developed a reputation as a rising New Deal star, taking over aschairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission from Joseph P. Kennedy in1937 and becoming a fixture in the president’s inner circle. A frequent weekendguest at Camp David, the presidential retreat that was widely known in thoseyears as Shangri-la, Douglas solidified his position with the president bylearning to perfect a dry martini, FDR’s favorite cocktail.Roosevelt grew so fond of Douglas that in 1944, while pondering running matesfor his fourth presidential run, he briefly considered his young SEC chairman.Douglas was an energetic New Dealer, FDR reminded a group of Democratic Partybosses who had gathered in the White House to advise him on the decision.Besides, he noted, Douglas played a stimulating game of poker. But the politicalbosses were not as enamored of Douglas as the president. They were well awarethat announcing a Roosevelt-Douglas ticket would set off a bombshell on WallStreet.While serving with the SEC, Douglas had become a scourge of the financialindustry. Bankers and lawyers accustomed to the hushed privacy of wood-paneledsuites and private dining rooms were yanked before public hearings presided overby Douglas and his sharp young staff and forced to account for their businesspractices. Even Robert Swaine of the white-shoe law firm Cravath—who had oncebeen Douglas’s boss—got the full treatment. “You stood me on my head and shookall the fillings out of my teeth,” he later told Douglas.With his craggy Western good looks and lean, outdoorsman’s build, Douglas seemedcut out to be a populist hero—an everyman Gary Cooper taking on pompous bigshots like the ones played by Edward Arnold in Frank Capra movies. Andstuffed-shirt John Foster Dulles was his perfect nemesis. Douglas once putFoster on the witness stand for two full days, grilling him about the fortunethat he had reaped for his law firm by managing a sketchy bankruptcy procedurethat had fleeced a multitude of creditors. The high and mighty Foster hadsquirmed on the stand like a pontiff forced “to do business with theunderworld,” recalled Douglas.By siccing men like William O. Douglas on men like John Foster Dulles, PresidentRoosevelt drove the plutocracy mad. J. P. Morgan Jr. was so incensed by the“class traitor” FDR that his servants had to cut out the president’s picturefrom the Wall Street titan’s morning newspaper for fear that it would spike hisblood pressure. The class hatred against Roosevelt even resulted in at least twoabortive coups against his presidency. In 1934, a group of Wall Streetplotters—financed by wealthy Roosevelt enemies (and Dulles clients) like the DuPonts—tried to recruit Marine war hero General Smedley Butler to lead an armedmarch on Washington. In 1940, newspaperman and socialite Cornelius VanderbiltJr.—one of FDR’s few friends in the New York club set—tipped off EleanorRoosevelt to another anti-Roosevelt plot he had heard being hatched in his FifthAvenue circles, involving tycoons as well as army officers.The First Lady was among those who wondered about the wisdom of allowing someonelike Allen Dulles to set up spy operations in war-torn Europe, where he wascertain to open lines of communication to Nazi interests. But Dulles was not theonly master chess player involved in this high-stakes game. FDR apparently hadhis own reason for allowing Dulles to establish himself in Bern. “He was adangle,” said John Loftus, a former Nazi war crimes investigator for the U.S.Justice Department. “The White House wanted Dulles in clear contact with hisNazi clients so they could be easily identified.”One of Dulles’s most important contacts in Europe was Thomas McKittrick, an oldWall Street friend who was president of the Bank for International Settlements.BIS had been created by the world’s leading central banks to administer Germanreparations payments after World War I, but it soon took on a life of its own,transforming itself into a pillar of the emerging global financial system.Lodged in a former hotel next to a chocolate shop in Basel, Switzerland, BIS wasso secretive that nobody was permitted to peer inside its boardroom, even whenit was empty. By 1940, when McKittrick arrived in Switzerland to oversee thebank, it was effectively controlled by Hitler’s regime. Five of its directorswould later be charged with war crimes, including Hermann Schmitz, the CEO of IGFarben, the chemical conglomerate that became notorious for its production ofZyklon B, the gas used in Hitler’s death camps, and for its extensive use ofslave labor during the war.Schmitz was one of the many Dulles brothers’ law clients and business associateswho were involved with BIS. It was a close-knit circle of men whoserelationships smoothly weathered the storms of war. Even as his company wasstockpiling poison for Hitler’s exterminators, Schmitz would send cheeryChristmas and birthday greetings to his American business friends.The secretive BIS became a crucial financial partner for the Nazis. EmilPuhl—vice president of Hitler’s Reichsbank and a close associate ofMcKittrick—once called BIS the Reichsbank’s only “foreign branch.” BIS launderedhundreds of millions of dollars in Nazi gold looted from the treasuries ofoccupied countries. Some of the gold was torn from the mouths of concentrationcamp victims or melted down from Jewish families’ candleholders, cigarettecases, and other personal belongings.Dulles connected with McKittrick as soon as he set foot in Europe, meeting withthe BIS president in Lisbon, even before he reached Switzerland. McKittrick, awell-tailored, pink-cheeked man with a high-domed forehead and prematurely snowyhair, later described the meeting as a happy coincidence. But both men wereclearly eager to talk business. As soon as he walked into the lobby of hisLisbon hotel, the banker recalled, “Somebody grabbed me from behind and said,‘Is that you Tom McKittrick? Well, my gosh, I’ve got to see you. You’re thefirst man I wanted to see in Switzerland.’ And it was Allen Dulles, on his wayover [to his OSS station in Bern].” The two men stayed up all night at thehotel, in deep conversation, until McKittrick had to leave for his five o’clockplane.Dulles was eager to pump McKittrick for inside information about the Reich,since the banker had good connections in Berlin. But the two men also wanted todiscuss another issue that was of paramount concern to both of them: how toprotect the assets of their German and American corporate clients in thetumultuous war climate.Like Dulles, McKittrick was not popular with Roosevelt and his inner circle.FDR’s Treasury secretary, Henry Morgenthau Jr., developed a deep loathing forMcKittrick, whom Morgenthau’s aide, Harry Dexter White, called “an American[bank] president doing business with the Germans while our American boys arefighting the Germans.” The Roosevelt administration moved to block BIS funds inthe United States, but McKittrick hired Foster Dulles as legal counsel, whosuccessfully intervened on the bank’s behalf.Morgenthau was outraged when McKittrick made a business trip to the UnitedStates in winter 1942 and was warmly feted by Wall Street. Dozens of powerfulfinanciers and industrialists—including the executives of several corporations,such as General Motors and Standard Oil, that had profited handsomely from doingbusiness with the Nazis—gathered for a banquet in McKittrick’s honor at NewYork’s University Club on December 17.Morgenthau tried to prevent McKittrick from returning to BIS headquarters inSwitzerland on the grounds that the bank was clearly aiding the Nazi war effort.The banker later sniffed about the “nasty crew in the Treasury at the time. . .. I was very suspect because I talked to Italians and talked to Germans—and Isaid that they had behaved very well. I [refused to denounce them as] villainsof the worst sort.” Allen Dulles came to McKittrick’s rescue, deftly pullingstrings on the banker’s behalf, and in April 1943 he finally boarded atransatlantic flight to Europe.Dulles and McKittrick continued to work closely together for the rest of thewar. In the final months of the conflict, the two men collaborated against aRoosevelt operation called Project Safehaven that sought to track down andconfiscate Nazi assets that were stashed in neutral countries. Administrationofficials feared that, by hiding their ill-gotten wealth, members of the Germanelite planned to bide their time after the war and would then try to regainpower. Morgenthau’s Treasury Department team, which spearheaded ProjectSafehaven, reached out to the OSS and BIS for assistance. But Dulles andMcKittrick were more inclined to protect their clients’ interests. Moreover,like many in the upper echelons of U.S. finance and national security, Dullesbelieved that a good number of these powerful German figures should be returnedto postwar power, to ensure that Germany would be a strong bulwark against theSoviet Union. And during the Cold War, he would be more intent on using Naziloot to finance covert anti-Soviet operations than on returning it to thefamilies of Hitler’s victims.Dulles realized that none of his arguments against Project Safehaven would bewell received by Morgenthau. So he resorted to time-honored methods ofbureaucratic stalling and sabotage to help sink the operation, explaining in aDecember 1944 memo to his OSS superiors that his Bern office lacked “adequatepersonnel to do [an] effective job in this field and meet other demands.”McKittrick demonstrated equal disdain for the project, and his lack ofcooperation proved particularly damaging to the operation, since BIS was themain conduit for the passage of Nazi gold. “The Treasury [Department] keptsending sleuth hounds over to Switzerland,” he complained years later. “The onlything they were interested in was where was Hitler putting his money, and where[Hermann] Goering was putting his money, and [Heinrich] Himmler, and all therest of the big boys in Germany. But I, myself, am convinced that those fellowswere not piling up money for the future.”While Allen Dulles was using his OSS post in Switzerland to protect theinterests of Sullivan and Cromwell’s German clients, his brother Foster wasdoing the same in New York. By playing an intricate corporate shell game, Fosterwas able to hide the U.S. assets of major German cartels like IG Farben andMerck KGaA, the chemical and pharmaceutical giant, and protect thesesubsidiaries from being confiscated by the federal government as alien property.Some of Foster’s legal origami allowed the Nazi regime to create bottlenecks inthe production of essential war materials—such as diesel-fuel injection motorsthat the U.S. military needed for trucks, submarines, and airplanes. By the endof the war, many of Foster’s clients were under investigation by the JusticeDepartment’s antitrust division. And Foster himself was under scrutiny forcollaboration with the enemy.But Foster’s brother was guarding his back. From his frontline position inEurope, Allen was well placed to destroy incriminating evidence and to block anyinvestigations that threatened the two brothers and their law firm. “Shreddingof captured Nazi records was the favorite tactic of Dulles and his [associates]who stayed behind to help run the occupation of postwar Germany,” observed Nazihunter John Loftus, who pored through numerous war documents related to theDulles brothers when he served as a U.S. prosecutor in the Justice Departmentunder President Jimmy Carter.If their powerful enemy in the White House had survived the war, the Dullesbrothers would likely have faced serious criminal charges for their wartimeactivities. Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg, who as a young lawyer servedwith Allen in the OSS, later declared that both Dulleses were guilty of treason.But with Franklin Roosevelt gone from the arena, as of April 1945, there was notenough political will to challenge two such imposing pillars of the Americanestablishment. Allen was acutely aware that knowledge was power, and he woulduse his control of the country’s rapidly expanding postwar intelligenceapparatus to carefully manage the flow of information about him and his brother.FDR announced the Allied doctrine of “unconditional surrender” at the CasablancaConference with British prime minister Winston Churchill in January 1943. Thealliance’s third major leader, Soviet premier Joseph Stalin, was unable toattend the conference because he was still contending with the horrific Nazisiege of Stalingrad. The Red Army would finally prevail at the Battle ofStalingrad, and the epic victory shifted the war’s momentum against the ThirdReich. But the costs were monumental. The Soviet Union lost over one millionsoldiers during the struggle for Stalingrad—more than the United States wouldlose during the entire war.The Casablanca Conference, held January 12–23, 1943, at a barbed wire–encircledhotel in Morocco, would sorely aggrieve the missing Russian leader by concludingthat it was too soon to open a second major front in France. But Roosevelt’sunconditional surrender declaration, which took Churchill by surprise, was FDR’sway of reassuring Stalin that the Americans and British would not sell out theSoviet Union by cutting a separate peace deal with Nazi leaders.The Casablanca Conference was a major turning point in the war, sealing the fateof Hitler and his inner circle. As Roosevelt told the American people in a radioaddress following the conference, by taking an uncompromising stand against theThird Reich, the Allies made clear that they would not allow Hitler’s regime todivide the antifascist alliance or to escape justice for its monumental crimes.“In our uncompromising policy,” said Roosevelt, “we mean no harm to the commonpeople of the Axis nations. But we do mean to impose punishment and retributionin full upon their guilty, barbaric leaders.”With his close ties to Germany’s upper echelons, Dulles considered theunconditional surrender declaration a “disaster” and was quick to let his Nazicontacts know what he thought about it. Shortly after the Casablanca Conference,Dulles sat down one wintry evening with an agent of SS leader Heinrich Himmler,an oily Mittel-European aristocrat who had flitted in and out of Dulles’s socialcircle for many years. Dulles received his guest, who was known as “the Naziprince,” at 23 Herrengasse, treating him to good Scotch in a drawing room warmedby a fire. The Casablanca Declaration had clearly unnerved Himmler’s circle bymaking it clear that there would be no escape for the Reich’s “barbaricleaders.” But Dulles took pains to put his guest’s mind at rest. The Allies’declaration, Dulles assured him, was “merely a piece of paper to be scrappedwithout further ado if Germany would sue for peace.”Thus began Allen Dulles’s reign of treason as America’s top spy in Nazi-occupiedEurope.Maximilian Egon von Hohenlohe, the Nazi prince, was a creature of Europe’swar-ravaged landed aristocracy. Prince Max and his wife, a Basque marquesa, hadonce presided over an empire of properties stretching from Bohemia to Mexico.But two world wars and global economic collapse had stripped Hohenlohe of hisholdings and reduced him to playing the role of Nazi courier. The prince hadfirst met Dulles in Vienna in 1916, when they were both young men trying to makea name for themselves in diplomatic circles. During the 1930s, after he fellinto the less refined company of the SS thugs who had taken over Germany,Hohenlohe popped up as an occasional guest of Allen and Clover in New York.Hohenlohe was just one more member of the titled set who saw advantages toHitler’s rise, and was quite willing to overlook its unpleasant side, which theprince explained away as rank-and-file Nazi Party excesses that would inevitablybe sorted out. The Hohenlohe family was filled with ardent Nazi admirers.Perhaps the most bizarre was Stephanie von Hohenlohe, who became known as“Hitler’s princess.” A Jew by birth, Stephanie found social position by marryinganother Hohenlohe prince. In the years before the war, she became one ofHitler’s most tireless promoters, helping to bring British press magnate LordRothermere into the Nazi fold. Stephanie took Hitler’s handsome, square-jawedadjutant Fritz Wiedemann as a lover and laid big plans for their rise to the topof the Nazi hierarchy. But it was not to be. Jealous of her favored positionwith Hitler, SS rivals plotted against her, spreading stories about her Jewishorigins. Her aunt died in a concentration camp, and Stephanie was forced to fleeGermany.But Prince Max suffered no such fall from grace. He roamed Europe, feeling outBritish and American diplomats on a possible deal that would sacrifice Hitlerbut salvage the Reich. Wherever he went, Hohenlohe got a brusque reception.British foreign secretary Anthony Eden warned against even speaking with theprince: “If news of such a meeting became public . . . the damage would farexceed the value of anything the prince could possibly say.” American diplomatsin Madrid, who were also approached by Hohenlohe, dismissed him as a “flagrant”liar and a “totally unscrupulous” schemer whose overriding concern was “toprotect his considerable fortune.”Dulles brushed aside these concerns; he had no compunctions about meeting withhis old friend. The truth is, he felt perfectly at ease in the company of suchpeople. Before the war, Dulles had been an occasional guest of Lord and LadyAstor at Cliveden, the posh couple’s country home along the Thames that becamenotorious as a weekend retreat for the pro-Nazi aristocracy. (There is nogetting around this unwelcome fact: Hitler was much more fashionable in thesocial settings that men like Dulles frequented—in England as well as the UnitedStates—than it was later comfortable to admit.)Royall Tyler, the go-between who set up the Bern reunion between Dulles andHohenlohe, was cut from similar cloth. Born into Boston wealth, Tyler traipsedaround Europe for most of his life, collecting Byzantine art, marrying aFlorentine contessa, and playing the market. The multilingual Tyler and histitled wife led a richly cultured life, with Tyler haunting antique shops andprivate collections in search of Byzantine treasures and restoring a château inBurgundy where he showed off his rare books and art. “Traveling with Tyler,”noted London OSS chief David Bruce, “is like taking a witty, urbane, humanBaedeker as a courier.” The contessa, who was equally sophisticated, moved inartistic and literary circles. She was at the bedside of Edith Wharton in 1937when the novelist expired at her villa outside Paris.Tyler was another one of those refined men who glided smoothly across bordersand did not think twice about doing business with Nazi luminaries. During thewar, he moved to Geneva to dabble in banking for the Bank for InternationalSettlements. Tyler’s virulent anti-Semitism made him a congenial colleague whenthe Reich had business to conduct in Switzerland. Well connected in the enemycamp, Tyler was among the first people whom Dulles sought out after arriving inSwitzerland.Now Dulles and Hohenlohe, and their mutual friend Royall Tyler, were gatheredamiably around the OSS man’s fireplace at 23 Herrengasse. Dulles broke the iceby recalling old times with Prince Max in Vienna and New York. Then the menquickly got down to business—trying to determine whether a realpolitik dealcould be struck between Germany and the United States that would take Hitler outof the equation but leave the Reich largely intact. As they spun out theirvisions for a postwar Europe, there was much common ground. Dulles and Hohenloheclearly saw the Soviet Union as the enemy, with a strong Germany as a bastionagainst the Bolshevik and Slavic menace. The two old friends also agreed thatthere was probably no room for the Jewish people in postwar Europe, andcertainly they should not return to positions of power. Dulles offered thatthere were some in America who felt the Jews should be resettled in Africa—anold dream of Hitler’s: the Führer had once fantasized about sending the pariahpopulation to Madagascar.The two men were too worldly to engage in any emotional discussion about theHolocaust. Dulles put the prince at ease by telling him that he “was fed up withhearing from all the outdated politicians, emigrants and prejudiced Jews.” Hefirmly believed that “a peace had to be made in Europe in which all of theparties would be interested—we cannot allow it to be a peace based on a policyof winners and losers.”Instead of Roosevelt’s “unconditional surrender,” in which the Nazi leadershipwould be held accountable for their crimes against humanity, Dulles wasproposing a kind of no-fault surrender. It was a stunningly cynical andinsubordinate gambit. The pact that Dulles envisioned not only dismissed thegenocide against the Jews as an irrelevant issue, it also rejected thepresident’s firmly stated policy against secret deal making with the enemy. Theman in the White House, clinging to his anti-Nazi principles, was clearly one ofthose “outdated politicians” in Dulles’s mind. While boldly undermining hispresident, Dulles had the nerve to assure Hohenlohe that he had FDR’s “completesupport.”The fireplace meeting was, in fact, a double betrayal—Dulles’s of PresidentRoosevelt, and the Nazi prince’s of Adolf Hitler. Hovering over the tête-à-têteat 23 Herrengasse was the presence of Heinrich Himmler. He was the Reich’ssecond most powerful man, and he dared to think he could become number one. Withhis weak chin, caterpillar mustache, and beady eyes gazing out from behindwire-rim glasses, Himmler looked less an icon of the master race than anofficious bank clerk. The former chicken farmer and fertilizer salesman inflatedhimself by claiming noble heritage and was given to explorations of the occultand other flights of fantasy. But Himmler was a steely opportunist and heruthlessly outmaneuvered his rivals, rising to become Hitler’s indispensabledeputy and the top security chief for the Nazi empire.It was Himmler whom the Führer had entrusted with the Final Solution, theirbreathtaking plan to wipe the Jewish people from the face of the earth. It wasHimmler who had the nerve to justify this plan, standing before his SS generalsin October 1943 and assuring them that they had “the moral right to destroy thispeople which wanted to destroy us,” to pile up their “corpses side by side” inmonuments to the Reich’s power. As Hannah Arendt later observed, Himmler was theNazi leader most gifted at solving the “problems of conscience” that sometimesnagged the Reich’s executioners. With his “winged words,” as his diligentadministrator of death, Adolf Eichmann, put it, Himmler transformed his men’sgruesome work into a grand and secret mission that only the SS elite werecapable of fulfilling. “The order to solve the Jewish question, this was themost frightening an organization could ever receive,” Himmler told the leadersof his killing teams. He knew how to appeal to his men’s sense of valor andvanity, telling them, “To have stuck it out and, apart from exceptions caused byhuman weakness, to have remained decent, that is what has made us hard. This isa page of glory in our history which has never been written and is never to bewritten.”And, in the end, it was Himmler who—despite his long enchantment with the Hitlercult—had the brass to consider replacing his Führer when he realized that thewar could not be won militarily. Prince Max was only one of the emissariesHimmler dispatched across Europe to seek a separate peace deal with the UnitedStates and England. At one point, Himmler even recruited fashion designer CocoChanel, bringing her to Berlin to discuss strategy.Himmler knew he was playing a very dangerous game, letting Hitler know justenough about his various peace feelers, but not enough to arouse suspicion.Dulles, too, understood that he was playing with fire by defying presidentialorders. After receiving a warning from Washington about the perils offraternizing with Hohenlohe, Dulles sent back a cagey reply, cabling that herealized the prince was a “tough customer and extreme caution required,” but hemight prove “useful.” Dulles did not find it necessary to inform his superiorsjust how deeply involved he was with Himmler’s envoy.Dulles and Tyler met with Hohenlohe on several other occasions over the next fewweeks, from February into April. And even as late as November 1943, Dullescontinued to forward to Washington Prince Max’s reports on Himmler’s frame ofmind. Dulles regarded the prince as a serious enough collaborator to give him asecret OSS code number, 515.In the end, Dulles’s machinations with Hohenlohe went nowhere. PresidentRoosevelt was very much in control of the U.S. government, and hisuncompromising position on Nazi capitulation was still firmly in place. When OSSchief Wild Bill Donovan informed the president about the Himmler peaceinitiatives, FDR made it clear that he remained adamantly opposed to cutting anydeals with the Nazi high command. As long as that was presidential policy, therewas nothing Dulles could do but bide his time and maintain his secret lines tothe enemy.Despite Heinrich Himmler’s elusive quest to cut a deal with the Allies, he neverlost faith in Dulles. On May 10, 1945, just days after the war ended, Himmlerset out from northern Germany with an entourage of SS faithful, heading southtoward Switzerland—and the protection of the American agent. He was disguised ina threadbare blue raincoat and wore a patch over one eye, with his trademarkwire-rims stashed in his pocket. But Himmler never made it to his rendezvouswith Dulles. The SS chief and his retinue were captured by British soldiers asthey prepared to cross the Oste River. While in custody, Himmler cheated thehangman by biting down on a glass capsule of cyanide.Even if Himmler had made it to Switzerland, however, he would not have foundsanctuary. He was too prominent a face of Nazi horror for even Dulles tosalvage. But the American spy would come to the rescue of many other Nazioutlaws from justice."},{"pageContent":"2 [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-8]HUMAN SMOKE [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-8]Neither Allen, Foster, nor their three sisters were ever as devout as theirfather, the Reverend Allen Macy Dulles, who presided over a small Presbyterianflock in Watertown, New York, a sleepy retreat favored by New York millionairesnear Lake Ontario. But the siblings always regarded the family’s summervacations on nearby Henderson Harbor as some kind of heaven. The huge lake andits sprinkling of islands held countless adventures for the children. The boyswould rise early in the morning and, in the company of a lean, laconic fishingguide, set off in a skiff, stalking the waters for the lake’s delicioussmallmouth black bass. At noon, they would ground their little sailboat on oneof the islands and cook their catch over a driftwood fire. The fish was fried incrackling pork fat, served with corn and potatoes, and washed down with blackcoffee. Years later, they would recall these summer feasts as among the bestmeals of their lives.Reverend Dulles was not a man of means, and he had difficulty supporting hisfamily on his modest churchman’s salary. His illustrious father-in-law, theluxuriantly bewhiskered John Watson Foster, who had served briefly as secretaryof state under President Benjamin Harrison and then established himself as oneof Washington’s first power attorneys, was a beneficent presence in the family’slife. Reverend Dulles sometimes resented his dependence on the old man’sgenerosity. But the whole family thrived during their summer idylls on LakeOntario, cozily squeezed into a big, red, clapboard cottage that had been builtby Grandfather Foster. Their lakeside life was rustic—the house had noelectricity and they had to pump their water. But it all seemed enchanted to thechildren.There were picnics and moonlight sails, and on the Fourth of July the childrenwould put small candles in paper balloons and set them floating in the air,watching as the golden lanterns drifted over the glittering water toward Canada.In the early evenings, Eleanor—the next oldest sibling after Allen—liked to siton the family’s dock and watch the clouds gather over the lake, casting red andpink shafts on the darkening water. “I never feared hell and I thought heavenwould be like Henderson but more so,” she mused in her later years.Eleanor was exceedingly bright and curious, and she refused to resign herself tothe prim, petticoat world to which girls of her generation were supposed toconfine themselves. When the boys and men would go fishing, she would sometimesplunk herself down in the middle of the boat. When robed Chinese dignitaries andother exotic figures from her grandfather’s diplomatic forays would pay visitsto Henderson Harbor, she would be certain to listen in on their conversations.Eleanor’s intelligence and determination would take her far, as she followed herbrothers into the diplomatic corps, where she would eventually take over theState Department’s German desk during the critical years after World War II.But, as a brainy woman in a thoroughly male arena, she was always something ofan outsider. Even her brothers were often perplexed about how to handle her.With her dark, wiry hair and thick eyeglasses, she considered herself the uglyduckling in the family. Her slightly askew status in the Dulles constellationseemed to heighten her powers of observation, however. Eleanor often had thekeenest eye when it came to sizing up her family, especially her two brothers.Allen loomed large in her life. She attached herself to him at an early age, butshe learned to be wary of his sudden, explosive mood shifts. Most people sawonly Allen’s charm and conviviality, but Eleanor was sometimes the target of hisinexplicable eruptions of fury. Her infractions were often minor. Once Allenflew into a rage over how closely she parked the car to the family house. Hismoods were like the dark clouds that billowed without warning over Lake Ontario.Later in life, Eleanor simply took herself “out of his orbit to avoid the stressand furor that he stirred in me.”Allen was darker and more complex than his older brother, and his behaviorsometimes mystified his sister. One summer incident during their childhood wouldstick with Eleanor for the rest of her life. Allen, who was nearly ten at thetime, and Eleanor, who was two years younger, had been given the task of mindingtheir five-year-old sister Nataline. With her blond curls and sweet demeanor,Nataline—the baby in the family—was usually the object of everyone’s attention.But that day, the older children got distracted as they skipped stones acrossthe lake’s surface from the family’s wooden dock. Suddenly, Nataline, who hadretrieved a large rock to join in the game, went tumbling into the water, pulleddown by the dead weight of her burden. As the child began floating away towardthe lake’s deep, cold waters, her pink dress buoying her like an air balloon,Eleanor began screaming frantically. But Allen, who by then was a strongswimmer, was strangely impassive. The boy just stood on the dock and watched ashis little sister drifted away. Finally, as if prompted by Eleanor’s cries, he,too, began yelling. Drawn by the uproar, their mother—who was recovering in bedfrom one of her periodic, pounding migraines—came flying down the dock and,plunging into the water, rescued little Nataline.Throughout his life, Allen Dulles was slow to feel the distress of others. As afather, his daughter Joan would recall, Dulles seemed to regard his childrenwith a curious remoteness, as if they were visitors in his house. Even his sonand namesake Allen Jr. made little impact on him when he excelled in prep schooland at Oxford, or later, in the Korean War, when the young man was struck in thehead by a mortar shell fragment and suffered brain damage. Clover Dulles calledher cold and driven husband “The Shark.”Allen did not take after his father. Reverend Dulles, a product of PrincetonUniversity and Germany’s Göttingen University, was a scholarly, meditative type.While his children explored the wilds of Lake Ontario, he was likely to besequestered in his upstairs study with his Sunday sermon. The minister was acompassionate man. While walking home one frigid day, he took off his coat andgave it to a man shivering in the street. On another occasion, he riskedexpulsion from the Presbyterian Church for performing a marriage for a divorcedwoman.It was her mother, Eleanor would recall, who ran the family. Edith Foster Dulleswas “a doer,” the kind of woman who “believed in action.” Eleanor would rememberher cracking the whip on her father. “Now, Allen,” she would tell her husband,“you’ve been working on that book for five or six years. Don’t you think it’sgood enough? Let’s publish it.”The reflective pastor was less of an influence on his sons than their mother andgrandfather. The Dulles boys were drawn to the men of action who called onGrandfather Foster, men who talked about war and high-stakes diplomacy, men whogot things done. Foster and Allen both lacked their father’s sensitivetemperament. Like Allen, Foster felt little empathy for those who were weak orvulnerable. He understood that there was misfortune in the world, but heexpected people to put their own houses in order.Foster’s callousness came into stark relief during the Nazi crisis in Germany.In 1932, as Hitler began his takeover of the German government, Foster visitedthree Jewish friends, all prominent bankers, in their Berlin office. The menwere in a state of extreme anxiety during the meeting. At one point, thebankers—too afraid to speak—made motions to indicate a truck parked outside andsuggested that it was monitoring their conversation. “They indicated to him thatthey felt absolutely no freedom,” Eleanor recalled.Foster’s reaction to his friends’ terrible dilemma unnerved his sister. “There’snothing that a person like me can do in dealing with these men, except probablyto keep away from them,” he later told Eleanor. “They’re safer, if I keep awayfrom them.” Actually, there was much that a Wall Street power broker like JohnFoster Dulles could have done for his endangered friends, starting with pullingstrings to get their families and at least some of their assets out of Germanybefore it was too late.Throughout her life, Eleanor wrestled with her brothers’ cold, if not cruel,behavior. A family loyalist to the end, she generally tried to give her brothersthe most charitable interpretation possible. But sometimes the brothers strainedeven her sisterly charity. The same year that Foster sidestepped the urgentconcerns of his Jewish friends in Berlin, Eleanor informed him that she intendedto marry David Blondheim, the man she had been in love with ever since meetinghim in Paris in 1925. Blondheim was a balding, middle-aged linguistics professorat Johns Hopkins University—with “a very sensitive mouth,” in Eleanor’sestimation, “and clear, brown eyes.” He was also a Jew. Eleanor’s parents hadgiven Blondheim their approval, calling him “charming,” after meeting him andEleanor for dinner during a visit to Paris. But by 1932, Reverend Dulles wasdead and Foster was head of the family. And he had a different perspective onthe mixed marriage that his sister and her fiancé finally felt brave enough toattempt.Foster wrote Eleanor a letter, asking her if she realized “the complications ofmarrying a Jew”—and helpfully pointing out a dozen such problems. Her brother’sletter stunned and infuriated Eleanor, who by then was in her midthirties andnot in need of her brother’s counsel in such matters. She promptly replied, but,not wanting to directly defy her imposing brother, she sent the letter to hiswife, Janet. In her letter, Eleanor made it clear that Foster need not troublehimself with her life’s “complications” and that, in the future, she wouldsimply “go my own way.”Years later, Eleanor tried to explain away her brother’s behavior. He was notmotivated by anti-Semitism, she insisted. He was just a product of his socialand professional milieu. In his circles, she explained, people would say, “Wecan’t have too many Jews in this club” or “We can’t have too many Jews in thisfirm.” Foster simply saw this attitude as a fact of life, Eleanor observed—“justlike the climate.”In 1934, the fragile Blondheim, distressed by the growing cataclysm in Europeand private demons, sunk into depression and killed himself, sticking his headinto the kitchen oven. Reasserting himself as paterfamilias, Foster swept backinto the deeply shaken life of his sister and took charge. The suicide must, ofcourse, be hushed up. And Eleanor must instantly shed the dead man’s name, orshe would be haunted by it in years to come. Eleanor dutifully complied withFoster’s direction and the name Blondheim was purged from the Dulles familyrecord, as if the brilliant man with the sensitive mouth and clear, brown eyeshad never existed. The fact she was about to give birth to Blondheim’s son was abond that Foster could never make disappear.In early June 1939, the German transatlantic ocean liner St. Louis cruisedslowly up the coastline of Florida. The ship, carrying more than nine hundredJewish refugees from Europe, had been turned away from its original destination,Havana, after days of increasingly frantic negotiations with the Cubangovernment. Now the black-and-white ocean liner, towering eight decks high andflying a swastika flag, had become a ghost ship, with dimming hopes of finding asafe harbor. While the ship was anchored in Havana Harbor, relatives of the St.Louis passengers crowded onto motorboats and circled the ocean liner,desperately crying out to their loved ones. As the tension-filled days went by,one passenger grew more and more agitated, convinced that he was about to beseized by Gestapo agents on board and bundled off to a concentration camp. Heslashed his wrists and jumped into the harbor, where he was rescued and sent toa hospital. He was one of the few allowed to stay in Cuba.As St. Louis captain Gustav Schroeder guided his ship along the Florida shore,his passengers could see the sparkling lights of Miami in the near distance.Schroeder had ordered his German crew to treat the refugees just like any otherpassengers. While the ocean liner had steamed across the Atlantic from Hamburg,the captain asked his stewards to serve ice cream to the children and to playmovies in the evening. But after the ship was turned away from Havana—where Naziagents had stirred up anti-Semitic feelings among the local population anddemagogues had fanned fears that the Jews would steal jobs that were everscarcer in the declining economy—the festive mood on board the St. Louis hadquickly dissipated. Now Captain Schroeder hugged the U.S. coastline in the dimhope that the Roosevelt administration would come to his passengers’ rescue.The doomed voyage of the St. Louis would become a symbol of the Jewish people’sterrible predicament. While the ship plowed the seas with its human cargo, thegovernments of the world—from Washington, D.C., to London to BuenosAires—debated its fate. In Washington, FDR’s Treasury secretary, HenryMorgenthau Jr., maneuvered strenuously to win permission for the ship to dock inan American port. Morgenthau, who had established himself as the conscience ofthe administration on the Jewish refugee crisis, dispatched U.S. Coast Guardships to follow the St. Louis as it journeyed north along the Eastern Seaboard,so he could keep track of the ghost vessel in case the government allowed it toland.Morgenthau was so integral a member of Roosevelt’s inner circle that he wasknown as “the assistant president.” He was of German Jewish ancestry andDemocratic Party royalty. His father, New York real estate mogul HenryMorgenthau Sr., had been one of President Woodrow Wilson’s major financialbackers and served as Wilson’s ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. Henry Jr., whoran a Hudson Valley farm near the Roosevelt family’s Hyde Park estate, woulddevelop a long personal and political relationship with FDR. When Franklin’sprivileged life was suddenly turned upside down by the ravages of polio,Morgenthau was one of the few political advisers who remained close to him,keeping his spirits up with games of Parcheesi.After he was elected to the White House in 1932, Roosevelt—who was the firstpresidential candidate to campaign against anti-Semitism—appointed Morgenthauand several other Jews to prominent positions in his administration. Fifteenpercent of FDR’s top appointees were Jewish, at a time when Jews representedless than 3 percent of the population. Bigoted enemies of the New Deal enjoyed aditty about Franklin and First Lady Eleanor—who was known as a champion ofAfrican American civil rights—that went, “You kiss the niggers / and I’ll kissthe Jews / and we’ll stay in the White House / as long as we choose.” There wereeven rumors that Roosevelt himself was Jewish.Morgenthau was acutely sensitive about the anti-Jewish sentiments that prevailedin the country, not least in the nation’s capital, where private clubs wouldrestrict membership to white Christians until well into the 1960s. And despitehis wealth, political status, and deep history with the president, he alwaysremained somewhat insecure with Roosevelt, who was not immune to some of theprejudices of his day. Looking back on his long service with the president,Morgenthau later said, “He never let anybody around him have complete assurancethat he would have a job tomorrow. . . . The thing that Roosevelt prided himselfthe most about was, ‘I have to have a happy ship.’ But he never had a happyship.”One of the least happy aspects of the Roosevelt presidency was the bitterinternal battle over the plight of European Jews. FDR was a man of consciencebut also an intensely political creature. The president—who was briefed fromtime to time in the White House by longtime supporters such as Rabbi StephenWise of New York and other Jewish leaders—was keenly aware of the imminentdanger facing the Jewish population in Hitler’s increasingly hostile dominion.In the spring of 1938, a year before the voyage of the St. Louis, Rooseveltbegan discussing a plan to rescue millions of German Jews and resettle them inten sympathetic countries. He vowed that he would request $150 million fromCongress to implement the plan.But Roosevelt found himself ensnared in political complications. He facedpowerful nativist and anti-immigration sentiments in Congress, which reflectedthe mood of the country—feelings that had only hardened in the Depression’ssavagely competitive job market. The president, who knew that he was widelyperceived as a friend of the Jews, wanted to avoid appearing too beholden tothem. This became particularly urgent as the 1940 presidential election neared,with FDR aiming for an unprecedented third term. In the final analysis, thepresident believed that the only way that the people facing Nazi persecutionmight be saved was through U.S. military intervention against Hitler. And withprominent isolationist crusaders like Charles Lindbergh labeling the loomingEuropean conflict a Jewish war, FDR realized that this was another reason not toappear too impassioned about the refugee crisis.As the debate raged within the administration, millions of lives hung in thebalance, including those on board the St. Louis. If Henry Morgenthau was thevoice of moral imperative in Roosevelt’s government, then Breckinridge Long, theassistant secretary of state in charge of immigration, was its avatar ofcynicism. Long used his bureaucratic wiles to frustrate Roosevelt’s efforts toease the restrictive immigration policies of the Depression era. In June 1940,he circulated a memo among his department officials, proposing that they delayfor an “indefinite length [of time] the number of immigrants [allowed] into theUnited States. We can do this by simply advising our consuls to put everyobstacle in the way and to require additional evidence and to resort to variousadministrative devices which would postpone and postpone and postpone thegranting of the visas.”As a result of Breckinridge Long’s delaying tactics, 90 percent of the quotaplaces reserved for refugees from Hitler’s and Mussolini’s dark realms werenever filled. This meant that another 190,000 souls who could have escaped weretrapped inside Europe’s burning building.One Morgenthau aide later called the Long cabal within the State Department “anunderground movement . . . to let the Jews be killed.” At one point, Morgenthauhimself—who always tried to restrain himself in these debates so as not toappear a “special pleader” for the Jews—felt compelled to confront Longdirectly. “Breck, we might be a little frank,” began the gentlemanly Treasurysecretary. “The impression is all around that you are particularlyanti-Semitic.”Long was convinced that he was being persecuted by “the communists, extremeradicals, Jewish professional agitators [and] refugee enthusiasts.” He was partof the State Department’s deeply entrenched, high-born culture—a WASParistocracy that regarded immigrants, particularly those non-Christian newcomersfrom central and eastern Europe, as socially offensive and potentiallysubversive. Anti-Jewish attitudes in this insular club were so deeply ingrainedthat they were reflexive.Perhaps not surprisingly, then, when young Allen Dulles was serving in the U.S.embassy in Turkey, his first overseas posting after World War I, he fell for themost notorious anti-Jewish fabrication in history. One day the young Americandiplomat was given a copy of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion by a Britishreporter who had fished the scurrilous document out of a secondhand bookstore inIstanbul’s old European quarter. The Protocols purported to offer a secret planfor Jewish world domination, and included tales about Christian children beingsacrificed for Passover feast rituals and other lurid fantasies. By the timeDulles got his hands on the book, which was the creation of the Russian czar’santi-Semitic secret police, the document had been widely denounced anddiscredited. But Dulles took it seriously enough to send a coded report aboutthe secret Jewish “plot” back to his superiors in Washington.Atavistic ideas about exotic Jewish “outsiders” were still widely prevalent inthe State Department in June 1939 as the St. Louis lingered along the EasternSeaboard, its food and water supplies running low. In the end, the Long factionin the Roosevelt administration would prevail in the debate over the ship.Captain Schroeder was forced to turn his ocean liner around and return toEurope, docking in Antwerp, Belgium, on June 17 after a month at sea, anddisgorging the men, women, and children on board to their fates. Less than threemonths later, Hitler invaded Poland, and Europe went to war. More than 250 ofthe St. Louis’s passengers would be swallowed by the Holocaust.As the war began, the struggle to save Europe’s Jews was far from over.President Roosevelt continued to be pushed and pulled by both sides of theincreasingly tumultuous refugee debate. Initial reports about the massevacuations of Jews to death camps in the German and Polish countryside werevague. The State Department bureaucracy bottled up much of the information, sothere was a great deal that Roosevelt never saw. Humanitarians like Rabbi Wisedesperately sought solid evidence of the Nazi extermination machine, which theyknew was essential in order to convince FDR to take decisive action.This was the desperate situation as Dulles began monitoring Europeandevelopments—first from his OSS office in Rockefeller Center and later from hispost in Bern. Among Dulles’s confidential sources was a German industrialist whowas the first prominent figure inside the Nazi domain to provide credibleinformation about the early stages of the Final Solution. The stories that theindustrialist brought across the Swiss border were almost too monstrous tobelieve. The information that began flowing into neutral Switzerland, thelistening post for war-torn Europe, should have helped force drastic Alliedaction. But it did not.On July 17, 1942, Heinrich Himmler’s luxurious private train—equipped with adining room, shower, and even a screening room—pulled into Auschwitz, abackwater town in the swampy flatlands of southern Poland. Word quickly spreadabout the Reichsführer’s unusual visit, soon reaching Eduard Schulte, the chiefexecutive of a major German mining company with property in the area. What hadbrought Himmler to this forlorn destination? Schulte reckoned that it must havesomething to do with the rapidly expanding prison camp outside town, where IGFarben had built a factory to utilize the camp’s slave labor.It is not widely recognized that the Nazi reign of terror was, in a fundamentalway, a lucrative racket—an extensive criminal enterprise set up to loot thewealth of Jewish victims and exploit their labor. The chemical giant Farben wasat the forefront of integrating concentration camp labor into its industrialproduction process, with other major German corporations like Volkswagen,Siemens, and Krupp following closely behind. Himmler’s SS empire movedaggressively to cut itself in on the spoils, extracting sizable payments fromthese companies for providing them with a steady flow of forced labor. Schulte,who was afraid that the rapidly expanding Auschwitz complex would begin tointrude on his own company’s mining properties, immediately took a wary interestin Himmler’s visit.Schulte himself was not a Nazi, but he had good contacts in those circles. Hisdeputy at the mining firm belonged to the Nazi Party and, in fact, knew Himmler.To ingratiate themselves with the party, the firm’s board of directors hadloaned the local Nazi chief a company-owned villa that was located in a nearbyforest. It was here that Himmler and his entourage were to be entertained thatevening.When Himmler arrived for the party at the company villa, Schulte was stillunaware of the horrific reason he had come to Auschwitz. Himmler was there towitness one of the camp’s new gas chambers, a white brick cottage known as“Bunker 2,” in action. That afternoon Himmler watched as a group of 449 Jewishprisoners, recently transported from Holland, were marched into Bunker 2 andgassed with Zyklon B, the pesticide produced by IG Farben. The execution processtook a full twenty minutes, and the victims’ frantic death cries could be heardeven through the chamber’s thick walls. Afterward, the bodies were dragged fromthe building by camp orderlies wearing gas masks and thrown into nearbyincinerators. One of the triumphs of German engineering was to devise aconvenient incineration process whereby the burning of the corpses provided theheat for the furnaces. Fritz Sander, the engineer who invented the system, laterlamented the fact that he could not patent his creation because it wasconsidered a state secret.Himmler observed the grotesque procedure unfold that afternoon in “totalsilence,” according to Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Höss. Later on, at the villa,he showed little strain from his day’s chores. The Reichsführer broke from hisaustere routine by enjoying a cigar and a glass of red wine. In deference to thefemale guests, the details of his camp tour were not discussed.Eduard Schulte was sickened when, a week and a half after Himmler’s visit, hefinally learned what had occurred during the Reichs-führer’s tour of Auschwitz.It confirmed his deepest fears about the Third Reich, a regime he had observedfrom its earliest days with a growing sense of dread. Schulte had met Hitler inBerlin back in February 1933 at a gathering of industrialists whom the Naziswanted to shake down for political contributions. After listening to hisrambling diatribe, Schulte concluded that Hitler was a dangerous lunatic whowould lead Germany to ruin.There was nothing rebellious or offbeat about Schulte. He was, in nearly everyway, a typical specimen of the German bourgeoisie—a hardworking, conservativefamily man whose only indulgence was a passion for hunting. But he was the typeof man who resented the steady encroachments of the Nazi state on his privatelife. In order to keep his position with the mining firm, he had been forced tojoin the Nazi-run German Labor Front. Even to maintain his hunting habit, heneeded to belong to a state-run hunters club. He fumed when his two boys camehome one day in Hitler Youth uniforms, though his wife reminded him it wascompulsory and said he was making mountains out of molehills. But in Schulte’smind, the “brown poison,” as he called it, was seeping everywhere.It pained Schulte, who had a close Jewish friend while growing up, to see Jewsbeing made scapegoats. He was a tall, outgoing, assertive businessman, but hehad a feeling for the underdog that might have been reinforced by his ownphysical disability. At the age of eighteen, while going to the aid of somerailroad workers, Schulte’s left leg was crushed under the wheel of a freightcar and had to be amputated. Outfitted with an artificial leg, he continued toget around with vigorous determination for the rest of his life, although withan obvious limp.When Schulte heard about the unfolding horror at Auschwitz, he knew he had toact. From what he could piece together, the macabre display of German efficiencyoverseen by Himmler that day was part of an official policy of massextermination that was now under way in the Nazi empire. The policy had beenformally approved earlier that year by the Nazi high command at a conferenceheld on January 20, 1942, in an SS villa on Lake Wannsee in suburban Berlin. TheWannsee Conference, run by Himmler’s ambitious deputy Reinhard Heydrich, laidout a plan for the elimination of Europe’s Jewry through a network of deathfactories. By lending the proposal a legal veneer, Heydrich assured the completeadministrative cooperation of the German bureaucracy. Even the title assigned tothe program of mass butchery—the Final Solution—conjured a civil servant’s dreamof a job well done.Heydrich, who called himself “the chief garbage collector of the Third Reich,”saw his gas ovens as a humane solution to the “Jewish problem.” He consideredhimself a cultured man. The night before he was assassinated by Czech partisans,who threw a bomb into his open car as it slowed for a hairpin curve, Heydrichattended a performance of a violin concerto written by his father, Richard BrunoHeydrich, a highly regarded German opera singer and composer.The Final Solution was meant to remain secret, with most of the death campslocated in remote outposts of the Nazi empire. But as the systematic killing gotunder way, many people became aware of the mounting barbarity. One day in early1942, an IG Farben official named Ernst Struss was returning home on a trainafter inspecting the company’s factory that was affiliated with Auschwitz. AGerman worker also riding on the train began talking loudly about the nightmareat the camp. Great numbers of people were being burned in the compound’scrematoria, he said. The smell of incinerated flesh was everywhere. Strussjumped up in a rage. “These are lies! You should not spread such lies.” But theworker quietly corrected him: “No, these are not lies.” There were thousands ofworkers like himself at Auschwitz, he said. “And all know it.”Eduard Schulte was not one of those men who could deny or hide from such atruth. On July 29, 1942—within twenty-four hours of learning about the assemblyline of death at Auschwitz—the mining executive was on a train to Zurich,determined to put the information in the hands of the Allies. The trip acrossthe border carried a high degree of risk. And Schulte, a prosperous,fifty-one-year-old businessman with a wife and family back in Breslau, had muchto lose. But the revelations about Auschwitz and the Final Solution that Schultewas carrying to Zurich filled him with an overriding sense of urgency.After arriving in Zurich, Schulte kept to his normal routine when doing businessin Switzerland, checking into the Baur-au-Lac, a luxury hotel on the lake wherehe was an honored guest. He then phoned Isidor Koppelman, a Jewish investmentadviser he knew whose services his company had used. Schulte was determined toget his information in the hands of international Jewish organizations, which hethought could prevail on the Allied governments to take action. The next day,meeting in his hotel room, Schulte gave Koppelman his shocking report. Theinvestment adviser sat in silence, taking it all in. Schulte said he realizedwhat he was reporting seemed too outrageous to believe, but it was absolutelytrue. And if the Allies failed to act, there would be few Jews left in Europe bythe end of the year. Schulte discussed the next steps that Koppelman should taketo get the word out, then checked out of the hotel and returned to Germany.The circuitous and troubled route that Schulte’s critical message took over thenext several weeks through diplomatic and political channels reveals much aboutthe failure of this bureaucratic labyrinth to confront the war’s soaringhumanitarian crisis. And, once again, at the core of this failure was thepoisonous culture of the U.S. State Department.Through Koppelman’s efforts, Schulte’s message was delivered to Gerhart Riegner,the young Geneva representative of the World Jewish Congress. Riegner, in turn,was intent on relaying the information to the president of the World JewishCongress in New York—none other than Rabbi Stephen Wise, FDR’s confidant and theleading voice of alarm in the United States about the Jewish crisis. The problemfor Riegner was that he was compelled to use the services of the AmericanLegation in Bern to dispatch the confidential cable to Wise. The U.S. diplomatsin Switzerland thought young Riegner seemed to be in a state of “greatagitation” as he related Schulte’s story. U.S. minister to Switzerland LelandHarrison, an old colleague of Dulles’s who was soon to be reunited with him inBern, took a decidedly skeptical view of the account; in his dispatch toWashington, Harrison dismissed it as nothing more than “war rumor inspired byfear”—although he did concede that some Jews were dying due to “physicalmaltreatment . . . malnutrition, and disease.”The State Department later sent the OSS a summary of the report that hadoriginated with Schulte. Allen Dulles, still working out of the OSS offices inNew York at the time, was one of those who received the message. The StateDepartment flatly refused to believe Schulte’s account, calling it a “wild rumorinspired by Jewish fears.” Even Harrison’s concession that some Jews were dyingas a result of the “privations” of war was stripped out of the State Departmentmemo.The State Department decided not to notify Rabbi Wise—whom Foggy Bottomofficials considered a thorn in their side—about his Geneva deputy’s efforts toreach him. It took a full month for Rabbi Wise to receive Riegner’s report. Whenthe telegram finally arrived in New York on August 28, it came not through U.S.diplomatic channels, but British. The State Department also did not see fit topass along the Schulte revelations to President Roosevelt.In frustration with the information bottleneck, Rabbi Wise finally held a pressconference two days before Thanksgiving, announcing that Hitler had alreadykilled about two million European Jews and had plans to exterminate the rest.The New York Times buried the story on page 10, The Washington Post on page 6.The press was reluctant to highlight such an explosive story since it lackedofficial government sources.Dulles, who was soon headed to Switzerland, could have been one of these sourcesfor the U.S. press. While still stationed in New York, he began sending outveteran reporters—under diplomatic cover—to gather intelligence in variousforward posts in the European war zone. One of these reporters, athirty-seven-year-old, Berlin-born, multilingual, former NBC correspondent namedGerald Mayer, was sent to Bern in April 1942. Soon after Schulte’s report begancirculating, Mayer also began filing stories about the Final Solution with theNew York OSS office. “Germany no longer persecutes the Jews,” began Mayer’sfirst stark dispatch. “It is systematically exterminating them.”But Dulles did nothing to publicize Mayer’s reports. They, too, remained buriedin the government bureaucracy. Along with the Schulte bombshell, these alarmswould have made a loud noise, particularly in the New York echo chamber. Theymight have finally blown apart Washington’s institutional inertia on the refugeequestion. But this was not part of Dulles’s agenda.History would give Dulles one more chance to alert the world to the ongoinggenocide. In Switzerland, he would hear directly from men like Schulte andothers who had risked their lives to save the Jews. In Bern, the evil was not soremote—it was all around.After arriving in Switzerland, Dulles took his time setting up a meeting withEduard Schulte. When the two men finally did come together in spring 1943 for afurtive meeting in Zurich, it was an amiable enough occasion; they had metfifteen years earlier, they realized, in the New York offices of Sullivan andCromwell, which represented Anaconda Copper, a partner of Schulte’s mining firm.The fate of the Jewish people was still of great urgency to Schulte—likely madeeven more urgent by the fact that during his trips to Switzerland, he had fallenin love with a younger Jewish woman who lived in Zurich. But Dulles expressedlittle interest in Schulte’s information about the Final Solution. Moreintrigued by the political and psychological mood of the German people and howthey could be won over by the Allies, Dulles asked Schulte to write up a memo onthe state of the German nation. It was Hitler’s people, not his victims, whomthe intelligence official thought important to understand.This was characteristic of Dulles’s meetings with German informants while he wasstationed in Bern. Fritz Kolbe, an efficient foreign service official who keptrising to higher posts in the German government despite his stubborn refusal tojoin the Nazi Party, was another mole who risked his life to give the UnitedStates rare insights into the operations of the Reich. One night, with documentsstuffed down the front of his pants, Kolbe crossed into Switzerland and made hisway to Dulles’s residence in Bern. Like Schulte, Kolbe was well aware of therisk he was taking. After this first meeting with the American spy, Kolbe drewup his will. He also left Dulles a letter for his young son in case he wascaught and executed. Dulles was untouched by Kolbe’s request. The OSS agentsized him up as “somewhat naïve and a romantic idealist,” which was not good forKolbe, since Dulles always regarded these types as expendable.But Kolbe had important information to impart, and he kept risking his life tosmuggle Nazi documents across the border. During another meeting with Dulles, inApril 1944, Kolbe handed over a thick sheaf of Nazi cables revealing thatHungary’s Jews, who had remained secure late into the war, were about to berounded up and deported to the death camps. Dulles’s report on this meeting wasone of the few from Bern that ended up on the president’s desk in the WhiteHouse. But there was nothing in Dulles’s communiqué about the imminent fate ofHungary’s Jews. And there was nothing about the possibility of bombing raillines to the death camps—and even the camps themselves—as informants likeSchulte were urging the Allies to do.Instead, Dulles chose to focus the president’s attention on another topic thathe had discussed with Kolbe over glasses of Scotch in his drawing room.Underground Communist organizing seemed to be gaining strength in Germany as theNazi war effort faltered, Kolbe had informed the U.S. agent. This was theemergency that Dulles thought the White House needed to hear about.Dulles continued to receive Nazi documents about the fate of Hungary’s Jews fromKolbe over the next seven months. One German cable reported that 120,000 Jews inBudapest, including children considered unfit for work, were soon to be “takento the Reich territory for work in the labor service.” The Nazis were alwayscareful to use euphemisms like “labor service” in their communications. By thisdate, Washington was well aware that Hungary’s Jews were headed to Auschwitz.And yet Dulles’s communiqués to OSS headquarters used the same banal language asthe Nazis, referring blandly to the “conscription” of Hungary’s Jews.When Dulles’s communications from Bern to Washington were declassified decadeslater by the government, scholars were able to decipher his wartime obsessions.Dulles’s interest was absorbed by psychological warfare tricks, such asdistributing counterfeit stamps behind enemy lines depicting Hitler’s profile asa death’s skull, and other cloak-and-dagger antics. He was also deeply engagedwith mapping out grand postwar strategies for Europe. But few of his more thanthree hundred communiqués mentioned the killing of Jews—and none carried a senseof urgency about the Final Solution.This glaring blank spot in Dulles’s wartime record continues to confoundacademic researchers decades later, though they remain reluctant to passjudgment on the legendary spy. “Why did Dulles choose not to emphasize theHolocaust in his reports to Washington?” wondered World War II historian Neal H.Petersen in his edited collection of Dulles’s OSS intelligence reports. Petersenclearly struggled to answer his own question. “Whatever his reasoning,” Petersenconcluded with scholarly restraint, “his reticence on this subject is among themost controversial and least understandable aspects of his performance in Bern.”In April 1944, Rudolf Vrba, a nineteen-year-old Jew from a village inCzechoslovakia who had survived for nearly two years in Auschwitz, escaped fromthe camp with Alfred Wetzler, a childhood friend, by hiding in a pile of woodplanks for three days and nights without food or water. They tied rags acrosstheir mouths to muffle the coughs that would have betrayed them to the SSpatrols that were methodically searching the camp for them. On the third night,when they finally felt it was safe to make their escape, Rudi and Fred emergedfrom the pyramid of wood and began crawling under the moonless sky across amuddy field toward a cluster of birch trees in the distance. The two friendswere determined to return home, not just to save their own lives but to bearwitness to what was happening inside Auschwitz.Their journey was harrowing. At one point, they were chased up a mountainside bya German patrol, with dogs snarling and bullets flying behind them. Along theway, they were helped by Polish peasants, who fed the famished teenagerspotatoes and coffee and guided them toward the Slovak border. Two weeks aftercrawling out of the woodpile in Auschwitz, they were home and—after being put intouch with Oskar Neumann, the chairman of the local Jewish Council—they begantelling their horrific tale. While the fundamental facts about the death campswere widely known by then, Rudi and Fred’s forty-page report was the mostthorough and specific to emerge from Auschwitz up to that point. It describedthe management and daily routine of the camp, and included haunting detailsabout how the prisoners were killed: “The unfortunate victims are brought intoHall B, where they are told to undress. To complete the fiction that they aregoing to bathe, each person receives a towel and a small piece of soap issued bytwo men clad in white coats.”In mid-June, nearly two months after the escapees wrote down their account, theVrba-Wetzler report was finally smuggled into Switzerland. A Britishcorrespondent named Walter Garrett got his hands on a copy, which he took toAllen Dulles on June 22. While the journalist sat with Dulles in his apartmenton Herrengasse, the spy read the entire report. “He was profoundly shocked,”Garrett later recalled. “He was as disconcerted as I was and said: ‘One has todo something immediately.’”Dulles’s pantomime of concern clearly convinced the British reporter. But infact Dulles had begun receiving reports about the mass extermination of Jewsover two years earlier, before he even left the United States for Switzerland.Authoritative reports on the Holocaust had continued to flow into his hands eversince his arrival in Bern, from informants like Schulte and Kolbe.“One” should indeed have finally taken drastic action. At that point, many ofHungary’s Jews might still have been saved if Allied will had been sufficientlymarshaled. Instead, Dulles sent off a routine cable on the Vrba-Wetzler reportto Secretary of State Cordell Hull, a man Dulles knew would not lift a finger tohelp the Jews, even though he was married to a Jewish woman. It was Hull who hadadvised FDR to reject the ill-fated passengers of the St. Louis. And it was Hullwho had blocked Schulte’s report from getting to Rabbi Wise through StateDepartment channels.Through the efforts of an exiled Jewish businessman in Geneva and a group ofstudents he recruited to make fifty mimeograph copies of the Vrba-Wetzlerreport, the eyewitness account of life and death inside Auschwitz finally brokein the Swiss press and was then picked up by The New York Times and the BBC. Inthe ensuing uproar, President Roosevelt and other world leaders successfullypressured the Hungarian government to stop the deportations of its Jewishcitizens. But the reprieve didn’t last long; in October 1944 Hitler ordered aNazi takeover of the government in Budapest and the death trains soon beganrolling again.In the final months of the war, as the United States and Britain finally openeda second front in the war, and Hitler’s forces were caught in an inexorable visebetween the Red Army in the east and the Anglo-American military machine in thewest, Roosevelt and close advisers like Morgenthau began contemplating the Naziregime’s postwar fate. The glory that was European civilization had gone up in“human smoke,” in Nicholson Baker’s words. But FDR was determined to keep thevow that he made repeatedly throughout the war. He would bring to justice theperpetrators of this unprecedented degradation of life. The Third Reich would beput on trial and its reign ground to dust.Once again, however, Allen Dulles and his allies had other plans."},{"pageContent":"3 [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-10]GHOSTS OF NUREMBERG [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-10]Nuremberg was a haunted city in November 1945 as teams of Allied prosecutors andthe world press converged on its bombed-out ruins for the first in a series ofhistoric war crimes trials. The Allies had chosen Nuremberg to put the ThirdReich on trial for its aggression and crimes against humanity because the cityhad been the main stage for Hitler’s pageantry, playing host each year to theNazi Party’s extravagant propaganda spectacles. Film director Leni Riefenstahlmemorialized the 1934 Nuremberg festival in Triumph of the Will, her paean toHitler’s highly choreographed militarism. In Riefenstahl’s film, the city ofmedieval spires and cobblestone streets was transformed into a fascistfairyland. Every building was draped with exquisite precision in Nazi bunting.Every golden youth in the teeming crowd was filled with adoration as Hitler rodeby, standing erect in his open car and returning the lusty cheers with his ownrather limp salute.But by 1945, Nuremberg had been reduced to rubble. On January 2, Royal Air Forceand U.S. Army Air Force bombers swarmed over the city and destroyed the gloriesof its medieval center in just one hour. More raids followed in February. Andthen, in April, U.S. infantry divisions attacked the heavily defended city,finally taking it after fiery building-to-building fighting.When Rebecca West arrived in Nuremberg that fall to cover the war crimes trialfor The New Yorker, she found only a ruined landscape and hordes of scavengers.Making her way over the rubble one day, she was forced to hold her breathagainst “the double stench of disinfectant and of that which was irredeemablyinfected, for it concealed 30,000 dead.” There was little food or fuel to buy inthe shops—and no money for transactions, only cigarettes. At night, a Stygianblackness fell over the ghost city, relieved only by an eerie constellation offlickering candles in shattered windows.That November, twenty-one prominent representatives of the Nazi regime that hadbrought Europe to this ruin faced their own moment of retribution as they sat inthe defendants’ galley in Nuremberg’s Palace of Justice, one of the few officialbuildings left standing in Germany. Hitler and Himmler were already gone, as wasthe Reich’s master propagandist Joseph Goebbels, escaping the executioner bytheir own hands. But the Nuremberg prosecutors had managed to assemble arepresentative spectrum from Hitler’s glory days, including ReichsmarschallHermann Goering, at one time the second-highest-ranking member of the Nazi Partyand Hitler’s designated successor. Goering was joined in the dock by dignitariessuch as Rudolf Hess, Hitler’s half-mad deputy who had flown to Scotland in 1941in a wild bid to cut a peace deal with Britain; Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Himmler’sgrim, scar-faced executioner, the highest-ranking SS leader to be tried atNuremberg; Hjalmar Schacht, the brilliant and arrogant international banker whohad financed Hitler’s military rise; Albert Speer, the architect of Hitler’simperial dreams and master of his weapons assembly line; and Julius Streicher,the unhinged politician and publisher who had parlayed his virulent brand ofanti-Semitism into a thriving media empire based in Nuremberg.Nuremberg, which enshrined the legal principle of personal responsibility forone’s actions, even in war, was a showcase of Nazi denial. When Hitler’s wilyforeign minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, was asked by an interrogator whetherhe was aware that millions had been murdered in the Nazi death camps, he had thegall to exclaim, “That . . . is an astounding thing to me . . . I can’t imaginethat!” It was as if he were suddenly waking from the bad dream of his own life.The defendants had long before abdicated all of their will to the Führer. Asdefendant Wilhelm Frick, the Reich’s minister of the interior, declared in 1935,“I have no conscience; Adolf Hitler is my conscience.”The most egotistical defendants, like Goering and Schacht, struck defiant poses.At times, Reichsmarschall Goering mugged for the courtroom, laughing at theprosecutors’ mispronunciation of German names and puffing his cheeks indignantlywhen they made errors about the Nazi chain of command.The Reichsmarschall had not even bothered to run from the advancing Americantroops in the war’s final days, convinced that he would be treated as theeminent representative of a defeated but noble people. His first hours incaptivity surely encouraged his optimism, as the U.S. 36th Infantry Divisionsoldiers who came for him at his quarters in southern Bavaria chatted amiablywith him and treated the well-fed Nazi to one of their chicken and rice dinnersfrom a tin can. Goering had no idea that he would be tried as a war criminal. Atone point he blithely asked an American commander, “Should [I] wear a pistol ormy ceremonial dagger when I appear before General Eisenhower?”But the Reich’s crimes would not be easily dismissed at Nuremberg. The very nameof the city conjured not only Nazi triumphalism, but the race laws that Hitlerordered to be written in 1935—laws that, by criminalizing Jewishness, ledinexorably to the butchery that followed. The city and its Palace of Justice hadlong been drenched with blood.Nine days into the trial, the dead would make a dramatic appearance in thecourtroom, conjured in a twenty-two-minute documentary called Death Mills. Thedocumentary was made by Hollywood director Billy Wilder, an Austrian-born Jewwho had fled Hitler, who compiled it from scraps of film taken by U.S. ArmySignal Corps cameramen during the liberation of several Nazi concentrationcamps. In his opening statement, Robert Jackson, the chief U.S. prosecutor atNuremberg, warned the courtroom that the film “will be disgusting and you willsay I have robbed you of your sleep.”But nothing could prepare those who viewed the film for what they would see thatday: the piles of shriveled corpses and the walking skeletons that greeted thestunned and sickened American liberators, the mangled remains of someone who hadbeen experimented on by Nazi doctors (“This was a woman,” intoned the narrator),the mounds of human ash to be sold as farm fertilizer, the pyramids of humanhair and boxes of gold dental fillings to be sold for wigs and jewelry—the finalvalue extracted from the victims of the Reich. One of the most punishing imageswas not grisly, but it would stay fixed in the mind’s eye—a close-up shot thatlingered on a bin of children’s shoes, well worn from play.As the film unreeled in the darkened courtroom, low lights were aimed at thedefendants so the courtroom could see their reaction. From this point on, therewas no place to hide. “The hilarity in the dock suddenly stopped,” noted onecourtroom witness. While the terrible images flickered on the screen, onecriminal mopped his brow; another swallowed hard, trying to choke back tears.Now one buried his face in his hands, while another began openly weeping.(“These were crocodile tears. They wept for themselves, not for the dead,”observed a British prosecutor.) Only the most arrogant remained impervious, withSchacht, Hitler’s banker, turning his back to the screen, and Goering “trying tobrazen it out,” in the words of assistant U.S. prosecutor Telford Taylor.Afterward, Goering complained that the film had ruined the show he was puttingon for the courtroom: “It was such a good afternoon too, until they showed thatfilm. They were reading my telephone conversations on the Austrian [annexation]and everybody was laughing with me. And then they showed that awful film, and itjust spoiled everything.”The Nuremberg trial was a moral milestone, the first time that top governmentofficials were held accountable for crimes against humanity that in earlier dayswould have likely been dismissed as the natural acts of war. During the war,Allied leaders had issued a “full warning” that Nazi war criminals would bepursued “to the uttermost ends of the earth . . . in order that justice bedone.” But it took a heated debate within Allied diplomatic circles before theinternational tribunal was finally established in Nuremberg. And even after itwas up and running, the process was fraught with political maneuvering.President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill were so intent onmeting out a fitting punishment that they originally favored taking the law intotheir own hands and summarily shooting Hitler’s top military, ministerial, andparty ranks—Churchill estimated the number would be somewhere between fifty anda hundred men. The prime minister thought that once the proper identificationswere made, the killing could be completed within six hours. In one of history’sdeeper ironies, it was Joseph Stalin who insisted that the Nazi leaders be puton trial, lecturing his Western allies on the merits of due process. “U[ncle].J[oe]. took an unexpectedly ultra-respectable line,” Churchill wrote Rooseveltafter meeting with Stalin in Moscow in October 1944. The Soviet premier toldChurchill that “there must be no executions without trial; otherwise the worldwould say we were afraid to try them.”Roosevelt finally came around to the idea of an international war crimestribunal. But once again he had to face stiff opposition from within his ownState Department. Future foreign service legend George Kennan, who was a juniordiplomat in the U.S. embassy in Berlin when war broke out, was one of those whotook a strong stand against punishing Nazi war criminals. Purging these leadersfrom German society would not only be greatly unpopular with the German people,Kennan argued, it would be hugely disruptive. “We would not find any other classof people competent to assume the burdens [of leading postwar Germany],” heinsisted. “Whether we like it or not, nine-tenths of what is strong, able andrespected in Germany” carried the taint of Nazism.It was not until late 1943 that a small, underfunded international commissionbegan the urgent work of trying to define the barbaric new crimes emerging fromWorld War II and compiling a list of war criminals for prosecution as soon aspeace permitted. FDR appointed an old friend named Herbert Pell as the U.S.representative to the United Nations War Crimes Commission. (The United Nationswas yet to be founded, but this is how the Allies sometimes referred tothemselves during the war.) Pell, a fellow New York Brahmin and ardent New Dealsupporter, quickly found himself in a political vortex, besieged by StateDepartment bureaucrats who did not consider an international tribunal necessaryand were determined to sabotage Pell’s efforts.At six feet five inches and 250 pounds, Pell was a towering man—and, raised inthe rarefied societies of Tuxedo Park and Newport Beach, he had more than enoughself-confidence to hold his own among his Washington foes. The Pells hadinherited a tobacco fortune, their forefathers had been granted the land thatwould become the Bronx and Westchester County by the British crown, and therewas no need for “Bertie” Pell to do a thing with his life if he had so chosen.Indeed, with his waxed mustache and pince-nez glasses, he seemed like athrowback to the Gilded Age. But inspired by the rambunctious reformism of TeddyRoosevelt, Pell leaped into the grubby fray of American politics, albeit inManhattan’s silk stocking district on the Upper East Side, which, despite itslong aversion to Democrats, briefly elected him to Congress. By the time his oldHarvard classmate Franklin Roosevelt ran for president in 1932, Bertie Pell wasa full-on renegade from his class, which he dismissed as a sybaritic and selfishlot whose “piglike rush for immediate profits” had brought ruin to the countryin the crash of 1929.Those who snubbed him at the clubhouse in Tuxedo Park—a rolling estate of woods,lakes, and citadels for America’s gentry located in Orange County, New York,some forty miles outside of New York City—were too stupid, in Pell’snot-so-humble opinion, to realize that Franklin Roosevelt was trying to savetheir bacon from a revolution that was rumbling right outside their gates. “I amalmost the last capitalist who is willing to be saved by you,” Pell wroteRoosevelt in 1936 in a letter beseeching the president to draft him for the NewDeal cause. The following year, Pell wrote again, praising FDR’saccomplishments: “Your administration has made possible the continuance ofAmerican institutions for at least fifty years. You have done for the governmentwhat St. Francis did for the Catholic Church. You have brought it back to thepeople.”Roosevelt finally did put Pell to work, sending him to Portugal and then toHungary as U.S. ambassador in the late 1930s, from where he watched with growingalarm the rise of fascism. By the time Pell was chosen for the war crimescommission in June 1943, he knew the full depths of the evil that had taken holdof Europe. He was eager to get to London, where other commission members werealready beginning to meet, but Pell found himself ensnared by State Departmentbureaucracy. His principal nemesis was the State Department legal adviser, afussy and officious man named Green Hackworth.The two men clashed immediately, on a personal as well as political level.“Hackworth was well named,” Pell recalled later. “He was a little, legal hack ofno particular attainments. He was manifestly not born a gentleman and hadacquired very few of the ideas of a gentleman on his way up in the world. Hismanners were bad, his fingers were dirty [and] he was clearly unused to goodsociety.”More important, Pell’s mission abroad was strongly opposed by Hackworth, whotook a narrowly legalistic approach to the war crimes question. War was notsubject to a moral calculus, in the eyes of State Department officials likeHackworth, who rejected the very idea that the international community mighthold heads of state responsible for atrocities against their own people. Thistraditional view was rendered obsolete by the Nazi inferno in Europe, but menlike Hackworth seemed oblivious to the new world around them.Pell, in contrast, was intent on bringing to justice not just Nazi Party highofficials, but also the German business elite who had profited from Hitler’srule and even the rank-and-file Gestapo men who, unless they were severelypunished, Pell feared, would go home to their villages and brag about what theyhad gotten away with. “The first thing is to make clear to every last German inthe world that war is not a profitable business,” Pell wrote to Secretary ofState Hull in 1943. Pell’s zeal for justice—and his broad definition of Germanguilt—sent alarms through the U.S. Foreign Service and Wall Street circles,where the primary concerns were related to postwar German stability.Green Hackworth and his colleagues successfully conspired to hold up Pell’sdeparture for months. Finally, after FDR intervened on his behalf with Hull,Pell was able to set sail for London on the Queen Mary in December 1943—a fullsix months after his appointment to the war crimes commission. Pell arrived in afrigidly cold, war-torn London, where heating fuel was in short supply.Fortunately, he had sent word ahead to his English tailor, who was able tosupply him with woolen long underwear that fit his large frame.Pell was shocked by London’s widespread war damage: every block seemed to haveat least one demolished building. Three of the friends in his small Londonsocial circle were killed by German bombs. One was blown up, along with the restof the congregation, while attending Sunday church. Only the minister survived.Pell toughed it out during air raids, staying aboveground instead of descendinginto the crowded, badly ventilated shelters. At age fifty-nine, he thought hewas more likely to die from catching the flu than by being blown up by a Germanbomb or a Doodlebug, as the British called the V–1 flying bombs whistlingoverhead. When the Luftwaffe bombers roared over London, they dropped hugeflares to illuminate their targets, and the city was cast in a spectral glowjust before the explosions began. As the president’s man in London, Pell thoughtit was important to carry on with his life in the same plucky manner as theBrits. One afternoon, he took a visiting cousin for tea at the exclusiveAthenaeum Club. Although every one of the club’s windows had been blasted out,the waiters still made their rounds with the same crisp and aloof manner as theyhad before the war.As the war crimes commission went about its work through 1944, Pell, despite hislack of legal experience, took a leadership role, developing prosecutorialguidelines for the postwar tribunal that would try Germany’s war criminals.While some commission members were uncertain how to categorize the Nazibrutality against the Jews, Pell vehemently argued that this violence, even ifconducted away from the battlefield, must be regarded as a prosecutable warcrime, and the commission came to agree with him.But Pell was unable to finish his work with the war crimes commission. InDecember 1944, he returned to America for the wedding of his only son—futureU.S. senator Claiborne Pell—and to consult with the State Department. Once theyhad him back in Washington, his political enemies were determined to never lethim return. Again, Pell appealed to his old friend in the White House to helphim overpower the State Department hacks. But this time, Roosevelt’s health wasfailing and he could not muster the energy to rescue Bertie. On February 1, theState Department announced Pell’s dismissal.In early April 1945, Henry Morgenthau went down to the presidential retreat inWarm Springs, Georgia, where FDR was convalescing, to urge him to directlyconfront the State Department cabal that seemed hell-bent on appeasing thecountry’s German enemies and antagonizing its Soviet allies. Sitting down forcocktails with the president, Morgenthau was shaken by the president’s “veryhaggard” appearance. “His hands shook so that he started to knock the glassesover. . . . I found his memory bad and he was constantly confusing names.” Afterdrinks and dinner, Roosevelt seemed to rally and he asked Morgenthau what he hadin mind. The Treasury secretary told him it was time “to break the StateDepartment” and replace the old guard with loyal New Dealers. FDR assuredMorgenthau he was with him “100 percent.” The next afternoon, April 12,Roosevelt died after suffering a massive cerebral hemorrhage.That same day, Pell was scheduled to meet in Washington with the new secretaryof state, Edward Stettinius Jr., to discuss being reinstated on the war crimescommission—a meeting that had been brokered by FDR. After he had been fired,Pell had fought on, working the Washington press and stirring up outrage overhis treatment at the hands of the State Department. The public controversy putPell’s enemies on the defensive. But in the wake of Roosevelt’s death, Pell waspolitically isolated, and by September 1945 he finally admitted defeat.There were two reasons he was targeted for political destruction, Pell told agroup of sympathetic lawyers who had rallied around him: “One is anti-Semitism,which is, to a large extent, prevalent in the State Department.” He alsoantagonized his powerful enemies, he explained, by going after “Germanindustrialists whose plight arouses the class loyalties of their oppositionnumbers in Great Britain and the United States. We cannot forget [for example]that one of the big war factories in Germany was the Opel Company which wasowned and financed by the General Motors Corporation, a company in whichSecretary Stettinius had a great interest. The biggest electric company inGermany was owned and financed by the General Electric Company of New York. Wehave here very potent reasons why a large and important group in this country istrying to pipe down on the serious investigations of [corporate Germany’scollaboration with the Nazis].”In the end, Pell would triumph. Because of the uproar in the press over hisdismissal, the State Department was finally forced to recognize theinevitability of a war crimes trial. In a statement released in the midst of thePell melee, the department acknowledged that President Roosevelt had repeatedlymade clear his intention. As the first war crimes trial got under way inNuremberg in November 1945, the spirit of FDR and the president’s justicewarriors—men like Pell and Morgenthau—hovered over the legal forum.But the political foes who had opposed Roosevelt’s day of reckoning for theNazis did not fully surrender. They remained determined to control theproceedings at Nuremberg and to protect valued members of Hitler’s hierarchy.In May 1945, Allen Dulles and OSS chief Bill Donovan met in Frankfurt withSupreme Court associate justice Robert Jackson, who had just been named chiefU.S. war crimes prosecutor by the new president, Harry S. Truman. During theirmeeting, Dulles underlined the various ways that he could be of use as Jacksonprepared his case, including providing German witnesses for the prosecution aswell as secret enemy documents. Jackson was delighted by Dulles’s offer ofassistance, noting in his diary that it was a “God send.” Donovan furtherreinforced the relationship with Jackson’s team by putting a number of OSSagents on his staff. But as the weeks went by, Jackson developed the sinkingfeeling that he had fallen into an OSS “trap.” It became clear to the Nurembergprosecutor that Donovan and Dulles harbored ulterior motives and agendas thatdid not always mesh with the interests of justice at Nuremberg.The tensions between Donovan and Jackson began to grow in July when the OSSchief moved to take over what Nuremberg prosecutors referred to as the trial’s“economic case.” As Wall Street lawyers, Donovan and Dulles consideredthemselves uniquely equipped to take charge of the case against theindustrialists and bankers who had financed Hitler’s regime. But such a rolewould have given the two OSS men the ability to control the legal fates ofGerman business figures who had strong ties to their own Wall Streetcircles—including infamous former clients of the Dulles brothers.Robert Jackson was a strong New Dealer who had risen through FDR’s JusticeDepartment, where he had taken on powerful corporate interests like the Mellonfamily and fought tax evasion and antitrust battles. Well aware of the corporateconflicts of interest that Donovan and Dulles brought to the Nuremberg case,Jackson stunned the OSS chief by informing him that he would not be leading theprosecution of Hitler’s financiers at Nuremberg.Jackson quickly discovered that his concerns had been well founded. As thetrial’s start date approached that fall, Donovan began communicating withGoering and Schacht, whom he recognized as the two most financially astute menamong the accused. Goering had amassed huge economic power under Hitler’sregime, organizing state-run mining, steel, and weapons enterprises and takingcontrol of heavy industries in the countries overrun by the Nazis. And Schacht,for his part, had remained a well-respected figure in New York, London, andSwiss banking circles even after selling his soul to Hitler. (Schacht later fellout with the Führer and spent the final days of the war in the VIP section ofDachau, where prisoners received relatively lenient treatment.) The banker knewwhere much of Nazi Germany’s assets were hidden, which continued to make him avalued man in global financial circles.Behind the scenes, Donovan took the shameless step of working out a deal withthese two prominent defendants, offering them leniency in return for theirtestimony against the other accused Hitler accomplices. When the OSS chiefinformed Jackson and his legal team that he had cut a tentative deal withSchacht and with—of all people—Goering, the prosecutors were aghast. TelfordTaylor, Jackson’s assistant prosecutor, later called Donovan’s actions “illconceived and dangerous . . . Goering was the surviving leader and symbol ofNazism. To put him forward as the man who could tell the truth about the ThirdReich and lay bare the guilt of its leaders, as Donovan appeared to expect, wasnothing short of ludicrous.”On November 26, a few days after the trial began, Jackson wrote a letter toDonovan, making it clear that their views were “far apart” and there was no rolefor the OSS chief on the Nuremberg team. By the end of the month, Donovan wasgone.But Allen Dulles was a more subtle practitioner of the art of power than WildBill Donovan. He would continue to play a crafty role in the dispensation ofjustice—or its opposite—not only during the first trial but through the elevensubsequent Nuremberg trials, which stretched from 1946 to 1949. In all, some twohundred accused German war criminals were prosecuted at Nuremberg, and hundredsmore would be tried in military and civilian courts over the following decades.But due to Dulles’s carefully calibrated interventions, a number of Europe’smost notorious war criminals—men who should have found themselves in the dock atNuremberg, where they almost certainly would have been convicted of capitalcrimes—escaped justice. Some were helped to flee through “ratlines” to Franco’sSpain, the Middle East, South America, and even the United States. Others wereeased into new lives of power and affluence in postwar West Germany, where theybecame essential confederates in Dulles’s rapidly growing intelligence complex.Near the end of 1945, Dulles returned home to New York, where, on December 3—afew days before leaving government service—he was asked to talk about postwarGermany at a meeting of the Council on Foreign Relations. He felt at home in thecouncil’s headquarters in the historic Harold Pratt House on Park Avenue, andhis remarks were frank and unfiltered that day. The first Nuremberg trial hadjust begun and Winston Churchill’s “Iron Curtain” speech was months in thefuture, but Dulles was already sounding the themes of the future Cold War era.The United States must not go too far in its efforts to cleanse Germany of itsNazi past, Dulles told the meeting. “Most men of the caliber required to [runthe new Germany] suffer a political taint,” he said. “We have already found outthat you can’t run railroads without taking in some [Nazi] Party members.”Dulles went on to explain why it was essential to ensure a strong West Germany.Signs of Soviet perfidy were already glaringly apparent. In Poland, he warned,“The Russians are acting little better than thugs. . . . The promises at [theAllied leaders’] Yalta [conference] to the contrary, probably eight to tenmillion people are being enslaved.”For Dulles, the wartime alliance that had defeated Hitler was already dead. Infact, he had been planning throughout the war for this moment when the Westernpowers—including elements of the Third Reich—would unite against their trueenemy in Moscow.On October 1, 1946, after nearly a yearlong trial, the fates of the twenty-oneNuremberg defendants were finally read aloud in the stuffy courtroom. Three wereacquitted, including the well-connected Schacht. Seven received prison sentencesranging from ten years to life. Like many convicted Nazi criminals in the earlyCold War years, a number of the Nuremberg defendants sentenced to prison werelater the beneficiaries of politically motivated interventions and earlyreleases; few of the some five thousand convicted Nazis were still in prisonafter 1953. A number of the interventions on behalf of fortunate war criminalscould be traced to the quiet stratagems of Allen Dulles.Eleven of the original Nuremberg defendants did face swift and final justice,sentenced to hang by the neck until dead. Among them was Goering, whom not evenBill Donovan had been able to save. The Reichsmarschall had predictablyproclaimed his innocence to the end. “The only motive which guided me was myardent love for my people,” he told the court in his bombastic final statement.This proved too much even for one of his fellow defendants, Hitler’s former vicechancellor, Franz von Papen, who angrily confronted Goering later during a courtlunch break: “Who in the world is responsible for all this destruction if notyou? You haven’t taken the responsibility for anything!” Goering simply laughedat him.Goering feared death by the noose, and he requested a soldier’s honorable exitby firing squad. When this last request was denied, Goering resorted to thefavorite Nazi means of self-annihilation, cracking a glass capsule of cyanidewith his teeth. (For men who had callously dispatched millions to their deaths,the Reich’s high officials proved exquisitely sensitive about their own methodsof departure.) According to Telford Taylor, it was likely one of Goering’sAmerican guards, a strapping Army lieutenant named Jack “Tex” Wheelis, whosmuggled the poison capsule into the condemned Nazi’s cell. Years after TexWheelis’s own death, his widow showed a visitor a small trove of treasures,including a solid gold Mont Blanc fountain pen and a Swiss luxury watch, bothinscribed with Goering’s name, that had been bestowed upon the American soldierby his German “friend.”Goering’s evasion of the gallows proved wise. The following morning, the tenremaining men who had been sentenced to death filed one by one into a gymnasiumadjacent to the courtroom, where three black-painted wooden scaffolds awaitedthem. With its cracked plaster walls and glaring lighting, the gymnasium—whichhad hosted a basketball game just days before between U.S. Army securityguards—provided a suitably bleak backdrop. The chief hangman, a squat,hard-drinking Army master sergeant from San Antonio named John C. Woods, was anexperienced executioner, with numerous hangings to his credit. But, due tosloppiness or ill will, the Nuremberg hangings were not professionally carriedout.The drop was not long enough, so some of the condemned dangled in agony at theend of their ropes for long stretches of time before they died. Field MarshallWilhelm Keitel, Hitler’s war minister and the second-highest-ranking soldierafter Goering to be tried at Nuremberg, suffered the longest, thrashing for afull twenty-four minutes. When the dead men were later photographed, they lookedparticularly ghoulish, since the swinging trapdoors had smashed and bloodiedtheir faces as the men fell—another flaw, or intentional indignity, in theexecution process.Julius Streicher, defiant to the end, screamed a piercing “Heil Hitler!” as hebegan climbing the thirteen wooden steps of the scaffold. As the noose wasplaced around his neck, he spat at Woods, “The Bolsheviks will hang you oneday.” The short drop failed to kill him, too, and as Streicher groaned at theend of his rope, Woods was forced to descend from the platform, grab hisswinging body, and yank sharply downward to finally silence him.After the first executions, the American colonel in charge asked for a cigarettebreak. The soldiers on the execution team paced nervously around the gymnasium,smoking and speaking somberly among themselves. But after it was all over, Woodspronounced himself perfectly satisfied. “Never saw a hanging go off any better,”he declared.The hangman never expressed any doubt about his historic role at Nuremberg. “Ihanged those ten Nazis . . . and I am proud of it,” he said after theexecutions. A few years later, Woods accidentally electrocuted himself whilerepairing faulty machinery at a military base in the Marshall Islands.The sectors of Germany occupied by the United States and its allies tried toquickly forget the war. Hollywood musicals and cowboy adventures—and theirescapist German equivalents—flooded the movie theaters in West Germany. But inthe Soviet-controlled East, there was a cinematic effort, though generallyparty-directed and heavy-handed, to force the German people to confront thenightmare and its consequences. In the early postwar period, there was a barrageof such dark movies, known as Trümmerfilme, or “rubble films.” One of the moreartful rubble films, Murderers Among Us, grappled disturbingly with the Nazighosts that still haunted Germany. Produced in 1946 by DEFA, the Soviet-runstudio in East Berlin, Murderers Among Us was directed by Wolfgang Staudte, aonce-promising young filmmaker who had made his own moral compromises in orderto continue working during Hitler’s rule. Staudte’s film reverberates withguilt.In the film, Dr. Hans Mertens, a German surgeon who had served with theWehrmacht, returns to Berlin after the war. The city is a monument to rubble; itseems to have been deconstructed stone by stone, brick by brick. Staudte neededno studio back lot or special effects. Demolished Berlin was his sound stage.Dr. Mertens, who wants to forget everything he has witnessed during the war,wanders drunk and obliterated through the city’s ruins. But his past won’trelease him. He comes across his former commander, Captain Bruckner, a happilyshallow man who, despite the atrocities he ordered during the war, has returnedto a prosperous life in Berlin as a factory owner.“Don’t look so sad,” Bruckner tells the doctor as the two men pick their waythrough the rubble one day in search of a hidden cabaret. “Every era offers itschances if you find them. Helmets from saucepans or saucepans from helmets. It’sthe same game. You must manage—that’s all.”Dr. Mertens’s bitterness deepens as he observes Berlin being profitably revivedby the very men who destroyed it. One day, fortified by drink, he comes across alively nest of vermin, scurrying about in the rubble. “Rats,” he says tohimself. “Rats everywhere. The city is alive again.”By the end of the film, Mertens has emerged from his drunken anesthesia and hasbegun to consider a path of action. How do you make a better world after a reignof terror like Hitler’s? Should he kill a man like Bruckner? Should he try tobring him to justice?Murderers Among Us ends on a hopeful, if fanciful, note. Mertens imaginesBruckner behind bars—no longer looking smug, but stricken. “Why are you doingthis to me?” he screams, as images of his victims float ghostlike around him.When the movie was produced, the first Nuremberg trial was still under way, andit looked to the world as if justice would indeed prevail. But as the years wentby, a surprising number of men like Bruckner not only escaped justice butthrived in the new Germany. Thanks to officials like Dulles, many Brucknersshimmied free from their cages. The rats were everywhere."},{"pageContent":"4 [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-12]SUNRISE [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-12]Allen Dulles’s most audacious intervention on behalf of a major Nazi warcriminal took place in the waning days of the war. The story of the relationshipbetween Dulles and SS general Karl Wolff—Himmler’s former chief of staff andcommander of Nazi security forces in Italy—is a long and tangled one. Butperhaps it’s best to begin at a particularly dire moment for Wolff, in thestill-dark early morning hours of April 26, 1945, less than two weeks before theend of the war in Europe.That morning, soon after arriving at the SS command post in Cernobbio, a quainttown nestled in the foothills of the Italian Alps on the shores of Lake Como,Wolff was surrounded by a well-armed unit of Italian partisans. The partisanshad established positions around the entire SS compound, a luxurious estate thathad been seized by the Nazis from the Locatelli family, a wealthy dynasty ofcheese manufacturers. With only a handful of SS soldiers standing guard outsidehis villa, Wolff had no way to break through the siege and his capture seemedimminent. As chief of all SS and Gestapo units in Italy, Wolff was well known tothe Italian resistance, who blamed him for the reprisal killings of manycivilians in response to partisan attacks on Nazi targets, as well as for thetorture and murder of numerous resistance fighters. If he fell into thepartisans’ hands, the SS commander was not likely to be treated charitably.At age forty-four, the tall, fair-haired, blue-eyed Wolff carried himself withthe supreme self-confidence of a man who had long been paraded around by theNazi high command as an ideal Aryan specimen. A former advertising executive,Wolff understood the power of imagery. His climb through the Nazi Party rankshad been paved by his Hessian bearing, his imperial, hawk-nosed profile, and theerect figure he cut in his SS dress uniform. Himmler, the former chicken farmer,drew confidence from Wolff’s suave presence and fondly called him “Wolffie.” TheSS chief made Wolff his principal liaison to Hitler’s headquarters, where healso quickly became a favorite.Hitler enjoyed showing off Wolff at his dinner parties and made sure that theSS-Obergruppenführer was by his side during the war’s tense overture, whenGerman forces invaded Poland and Hitler prepared to join his troops at thefront. “To my great and, I openly admit, joyful surprise, I was ordered to theinnermost Führer headquarters,” Wolff proudly recalled as an old man. “Hitlerwanted to have me nearby, because he knew that he could rely on me completely.He had known me for a long time, and rather well.”But in April 1945, encircled by his enemies at the Villa Locatelli, Wolff wasfar from these glory days. The desperation of his situation was underlined thefollowing day when Benito Mussolini, Italy’s once all-powerful Duce, whosestatus had been reduced to that of Wolff’s ward, was captured by partisans at aroadblock on the northern tip of Lake Como while fleeing with his dwindlingentourage for Switzerland. Taken to the crumbling but still grand city hall inthe nearby lakeside village of Dongo, Mussolini was assured he would be treatedmercifully. “Don’t worry,” the mayor told him, “you will be all right.”A horde of partisans and curious townspeople crowded into the mayor’s office, tofire questions at the man who had ruled Italy for over two decades. Mussolinianswered each question thoughtfully. In the final months of his life, he hadgrown increasingly reflective and resigned to his fate. He spent more timereading—his tastes ranged from Dostoyevsky and Hemingway to Plato andNietzsche—than dealing with governmental affairs. “I am crucified by mydestiny,” Mussolini had told a visiting Italian army chaplain in his final days.When his captors asked him why he had allowed the Germans to exact harshretributions on the Italian people, Mussolini mournfully explained that it wasbeyond his power. “My hands were tied. There was very little possibility ofopposing General [Albert] Kesselring [field commander of the German armed forcesin Italy] and General Wolff in what they did. Again and again in conversationswith General Wolff, I mentioned that stories of people being tortured and otherbrutal deeds had come to my ears. One day Wolff replied that it was the onlymeans of extracting the truth, and even the dead spoke the truth in his torturechambers.”In the end, Mussolini found no mercy. He and his mistress, Claretta Petacci, whoinsisted on sharing his fate, were machine-gunned and their bodies were put ondisplay in Milan’s Piazzale Loreto. Mussolini’s body was subjected to particularabuse by the large, frantic crowd in the square; one woman fired five shots intoIl Duce’s head—one for each of her five dead sons. The bodies were then strungup by their feet from the overhanging girders of a garage roof, where they weresubjected to further indignities. When he heard about Mussolini’s grotesquefinale, Hitler—who, near the end, had told the Duce that he was “perhaps theonly friend I have in the world”—ordered that his own body be burned after hekilled himself.General Wolff knew that he, too, faced a merciless end if he fell captive atVilla Locatelli. But unlike Mussolini, the SS commander had a very dedicated andpowerful friend in the enemy camp.At eleven in the morning on April 26, Allen Dulles received an urgent phone callin his Bern office from Max Waibel, his contact in Swiss intelligence. Waibelreported that Karl Wolff was surrounded by partisans at Villa Locatelli and“there was a great danger they might storm the villa and kill Wolff.”The SS general was the key to Dulles’s greatest wartime ambition: securing aseparate peace with Nazi forces in Italy before the Soviet army could push intoAustria and southward toward Trieste. With the Communists playing a dominantrole in the Italian resistance, Dulles knew that blocking the advance of the RedArmy into northern Italy was critical if Italy was to be prevented from fallinginto the Soviet orbit after the war. Dulles and his intelligence colleagues hadbeen secretly meeting with Wolff and his SS aides since late February, trying towork out a separate surrender of German forces in Italy that would save the Naziofficers’ necks and win the OSS spymaster the glory that had eluded himthroughout the war.The negotiations for Operation Sunrise, as Dulles optimistically christened hiscovert peace project, were a highly delicate dance. Exposure could spelldisaster for both men. According to Wolff, during their diplomatic courtship,Dulles identified himself as a “special representative” and “a personal friend”of President Roosevelt—neither of which was true. In fact, by negotiating withthe SS general, Dulles was clearly violating FDR’s emphatic policy ofunconditional surrender. Just days before Wolff was trapped at Villa Locatelli,Dulles had been expressly forbidden by Washington from continuing his contactswith Wolff.Meanwhile, the SS commander’s secret diplomatic efforts both dovetailed andcompeted with the numerous other Nazi peace initiatives coming Dulles’s way,including that of his boss, Heinrich Himmler, who was also shrewd enough torealize that the German war effort was doomed and he along with it, unless hemanaged to cut his own deal. Even the Führer himself was toying with the idea ofhow he might save the Reich by splitting the Allies and winning a favorablepeace settlement. In his backroom dealing with Dulles, Wolff at times foundhimself an emissary of the Nazi high command and at other times a traitorousagent working at cross-purposes to save his own skin.But with Wolff now surrounded by Italian resistance fighters at Villa Locatelli,his end seemed near—and with it, all the painstaking and duplicitous effortsundertaken by the two men over the previous two months on behalf of OperationSunrise. Dulles had too much at stake to let his happen. Alerted to Wolff’spredicament, he flew into action, mounting a rescue party to cross the borderand reach the villa before it was too late.Dulles knew that risking brave men to save a Nazi war criminal’s life—in theinterests of his own unsanctioned peace mission—was an act of brazeninsubordination that could cost him his intelligence career. So, to give himselfcover, Dulles arranged for his loyal subordinate, Gero von Schulze-Gaevernitz,to oversee the rescue.Dulles later related the story with typical bonhomie—but, as was often the case,his glib delivery masked a darker tale. “I told Gaevernitz that under the strictorders I had received, I could not get in touch with Wolff. . . . Gaevernitzlistened silently for a moment. Then he said that since the whole [OperationSunrise] affair seemed to have come to an end, he would like to go on a littletrip for a few days. I noticed a twinkle in his eye, and as he told me later, henoticed one in mine. I realized, of course, what he was going to do, and that heintended to do it on his own responsibility.”When it came to saving Wolff, Gaevernitz shared his boss’s zeal. Gaevernitz wasthe handsome scion of an illustrious European family and a relative of theStinnes family, whose fortune had helped finance Hitler’s political rise. TheGaevernitzes had broken from the Nazis early on, and Dulles helped funnel theirmoney to safe havens outside of Germany, as he did for many wealthy Germans,including those who remained loyal to the Nazi regime, before and during thewar. Dulles and Gaevernitz were also tied together by their political views—theyboth believed that “moderate” members of Hitler’s regime must be salvaged fromthe war’s wreckage and incorporated into postwar plans for Germany. By theextremely generous standards of Dulles and Gaevernitz, even Karl Wolff qualifiedas one such redeemable Nazi.After being dispatched by Dulles, Gaevernitz, accompanied by the Swiss secretagent Waibel, jumped on an Italy-bound train, arriving at the Swiss border townof Chiasso late that evening. There they met one of Dulles’s top agents, DonJones, a man well known to the Italian resistance fighters in the border area as“Scotti.” Gaevernitz thought that Scotti, a man who risked his life each dayfighting SS soldiers, would balk at the idea of saving the general who commandedthem. But Scotti gamely agreed to lead the mission.And so, as midnight approached, a convoy of three cars set off toward thewestern shore of Lake Como. One vehicle carried OSS agent Scotti and three Swissintelligence operatives, the second was filled with Italian partisans, and thethird conveyed two SS officials Dulles had recruited to ease the convoy’spassage through German-controlled areas. It was one of the most bizarre missionsin wartime Europe: a joint U.S.-German rescue effort organized for the benefitof a high-ranking Nazi general.As the convoy crawled through the dark toward the lake, partisans opened fire onthe cars. Scotti bravely jumped out of his vehicle and stood in the headlights,praying that the resistance soldiers would recognize him and stop shooting.Fortunately, one did. There was more gunfire and even a grenade attack as theycontinued their journey, but finally, the odd rescue team arrived at the VillaLocatelli. After talking their way past the partisans’ blockade as well as theSS guard, they entered the villa and found General Wolff in full SS uniform, asif he had been expecting them all along. He offered the rescue party some of thevintage Scotch he kept for special occasions, volunteering that the whiskey hadbeen expropriated from the British by Rommel during the North African campaign.It was after two in the morning when the caravan arrived safely back in Chiassowith their special passenger, who had changed into civilian clothes for thejourney and was slumped low in the backseat of the middle car. Gaevernitz wasanxiously awaiting the rescue team’s return in the dingy railroad station café.He had no intention of greeting Wolff in public. But when the SS general heardthat Dulles’s aide was there, he bounded over to him and shook his hand. “I willnever forget what you have done for me,” Wolff declared.Dulles and Gaevernitz would learn that the SS man had a strange sense ofgratitude. In the coming years, Wolff would become a millstone around theirnecks.Later that morning, an exhausted Gaevernitz, who had not been out of his clothesall that night, took a train to his family’s lovely villa in Ascona, on LakeMaggiore, so he could enjoy a long sleep. At the railway station in Locarno,where he stopped for breakfast, he listened to the 7:00 a.m. radio broadcast,which was filled with news of Mussolini’s capture and other dramatic bulletinsfrom the Lake Como area. Gaevernitz kept expecting to hear news of GeneralWolff’s rescue by a U.S.-led team of commandos; he was determined that hisboss’s name must be kept out of the story.“It would have made a lovely headline in the papers,” Gaevernitz later mused inhis diary. “‘German S.S. General Rescued From Italian Patriots by AmericanConsul’!!! Poor Allen!! I really felt I had to spare him this [embarrassment].”It took Wolff several more days of high-stakes diplomacy before his maneuversfinally resulted in the surrender of German forces on the Italian front on May2, 1945. By then, Hitler was dead, the German military machine had all butcollapsed, and it was just six days before the capitulation of all Axis forcesin Europe. In the end, Operation Sunrise saved few lives and had little impacton the course of the war. It did succeed, however, in creating a new set ofinternational tensions that some historians would identify as the first icyfissures of the Cold War.The Dulles-Wolff maneuvers aggravated Stalin’s paranoid disposition. While hewas still alive, Roosevelt, whom Stalin genuinely liked and trusted, was able toreassure the Soviet leader that the United States had no intention of betrayingan alliance forged in blood. But after FDR’s death, Stalin’s fears of a stab inthe back at Caserta—where the surrender on the Italian front was signed byGerman and American military commanders—only grew more intense. His suspicionswere not unfounded. After the separate peace was declared at Caserta, someGerman divisions in Italy were told not to lay down their arms but to get readyto begin battling the Red Army alongside the Americans and British.Even Roosevelt’s successor, Harry S. Truman, who would become a dedicated ColdWarrior, took a dim view of Operation Sunrise and tried unsuccessfully to shutit down. Truman later wrote in his memoir that Dulles’s unauthorized diplomacystirred up a tempest of trouble for him during his first days as president.Operation Sunrise would become Allen Dulles’s creation myth, the legend thatloomed over his entire intelligence career. For the rest of his life, thespymaster would energetically work the publicity machinery on “the secretsurrender,” generating magazine articles and more than one book and attemptingto turn the tale into a Hollywood thriller. It was, according to the story thatDulles assiduously spun throughout the rest of his life, a feat of daringpersonal diplomacy. Time magazine—which, under the ownership of his close friendHenry Luce, could always be counted on to give Dulles good press—trumpetedOperation Sunrise as “one of the most stunning triumphs in the history of secretwartime diplomacy.” The reality, however, was far from triumphant.Karl Wolff was Allen Dulles’s kind of Nazi. Like Hitler and Himmler, Dullesadmired Wolff’s gentlemanly comportment and found him “extremely good-looking.”He struck Dulles as a man with the right sort of pedigree, the type oftrustworthy fellow with whom he could do business.Wolff liked to present himself as a high-level administrator who was unsulliedby the more inhumane operations of his government. He was not one of the NaziParty’s vulgar anti-Semites, he would later insist. He took pride in rescuingthe occasional prominent Jewish prisoner from the Gestapo dungeons—a banker, atennis celebrity, for instance. Eichmann sneeringly referred to Wolff as one ofthe “dandy officers of the SS, who wore white gloves and didn’t want to knowanything about what’s going on.”Wolff was a financially savvy fixer, a man whom the Nazi hierarchy could rely onto get things done. After serving with distinction as a young army officer onthe western front during World War I, Wolff originally pursued a career inbanking, before going into advertising. But his ambitions in both fields werethwarted by Germany’s postwar economic crash. His decision to join Hitler’srapidly growing enterprise, where he rose quickly through the ranks, was more ofa professional decision than an ideological one. There were unlimitedopportunities in the Nazi movement for a polished blond warrior like Wolff.His business background gave Wolff cachet in the SS, where such skills were inshort supply. It was Wolff who was put in charge of Himmler’s important “circleof friends,” a select group of some three dozen German industrialists andbankers who supplied the SS with a stream of slush money. “Himmler was nobusinessman and I took care of banking matters for him,” Wolff later recalled.In return for their generosity, the corporate donors were given special accessto pools of slave labor. They were also invited to attend high-level governmentmeetings and special Nazi Party ceremonies. It was said that Wolff took suchgood care of the wealthy contributors at the 1933 Nuremberg rally that they werepampered more than the Führer himself. On other occasions, the privileged circleof friends was even taken on private tours of the Dachau and Sachsenhausenconcentration camps, escorted by Himmler and Wolff. Presumably the SS shut downthe camps’ crematoria during the distinguished guests’ visits to spare them theunpleasant stench.In pursuing the Sunrise peace pact, Dulles and Wolff harbored similar politicalmotives. Both viewed the Soviet army’s advance into Western Europe as acatastrophe. But they also shared business interests. Throughout the war, Dulleshad used his OSS command post in Switzerland to look out for Sullivan andCromwell business clients in Europe. Stopping the war before these clients’manufacturing and power plants in industrial northern Italy were destroyed was apriority for both men.Under the terms of Operation Sunrise, Wolff specifically agreed not to blow upthe region’s many hydroelectric plants, which generated power from the waterroaring down from the Alps. Most of these installations were owned by amultinational holding company called Italian Superpower Corporation.Incorporated in Delaware in 1928, Italian Superpower’s board was evenly dividedbetween American and Italian utility executives, and by the following year thepower company was swallowed by a bigger, J. P. Morgan–financed cartel. The tiesbetween Italian Superpower and Dulles’s financial circle were reinforced when,toward the end of the war, the spymaster’s good friend—New York banker JamesRussell Forgan—took over as his OSS boss in London. Forgan was one of ItalianSuperpower’s directors.Dulles concluded that Wolff was, in effect, a member of his international club—aman with similar views, connections, and willingness to do business. Neither manwas particularly interested in the clash of ideas or human tragedies associatedwith the war. They were fixed on the calculus of power; each understood theother’s intense ambition. Operation Sunrise was for both of them a bold,high-wire career move.After he decided that Wolff was a dependable partner, Dulles went to greatlengths to rehabilitate the SS commander’s image. In his reports back to OSSheadquarters, he framed Wolff in the best possible light: he was a “moderate”and “probably the most dynamic [German] personality in North Italy.” Althoughsome U.S. and British intelligence officials suspected that Wolff was serving asan agent of Hitler and Himmler and trying to drive a wedge between the Allies,Dulles insisted that the German general was acting heroically and selflessly tobring peace to Italy and to spare its land, people, and art treasures from afinal, scorched-earth conflagration.Dulles knew from the beginning that working with Wolff was an extremely riskyproposition—not just because of the Allies’ strict prohibition against aseparate peace deal but because Himmler’s right-hand man was certain to beplaced high on the list of Nazi war criminals. Even many years later, when theevidence against Wolff had grown to utterly damning proportions, the old spyrefused to pass judgment on him. “The conclusions [about Wolff] must be left tohistory,” wrote Dulles in his carefully calibrated Operation Sunrise memoir. Hewas delaying a judgment that, for many, had long since been obvious.When Wolff was later confronted with the obscenity of the Nazi leadership’s warcrimes, he would inevitably plead ignorance, claiming he occupied such a loftyperch in the Reich’s clouds that he did not learn about the death camps untilthe final days of the war. When this tactic failed, he would claim that he hadbeen powerless to stop the mass slaughter, or he would fall back on legalismsand other technical evasions. But the stains on Wolff were not so easily erased.Karl Wolff, who would go down in history as “one of the unknown giants ofHitler’s Reich,” was content to operate in the shadows. While little known bythe public, however, he played a prominent administrative role in Hitler’slethal assembly line. He was, as Time magazine later branded him, the“Bureaucrat of Death.”The Nuremberg trials would firmly establish the principle that administrators ofmurder—not just the actual executioners—could be found guilty of war crimes.Although he was not a central cog in the daily operations of the Holocaust likeAdolf Eichmann, Wolff, as Himmler’s top troubleshooter, frequently intervened toensure the smooth efficiency of the extermination process.During the Nuremberg trials, a highly incriminating letter written by Wolffwould emerge that made it clear how important his intervention could be inkeeping the trains rolling to the death camps. In July 1942, after the trainshauling Polish Jews to the Treblinka gas chambers were temporarily haltedbecause of the German military’s demand for railcars, Wolff appealed to a Nazitransportation official for help. After the rail shortage was successfullyresolved, Wolff sent off a heartfelt letter of thanks.“I was especially pleased,” Wolff wrote the transportation minister in achillingly bureaucratic note, “to receive the information that, for the last 14days, a train has been leaving daily for Treblinka with 5,000 members of thechosen people, and that in this way we are in a position to carry out thispopulation movement at an accelerated tempo.”Wolff also played a key administrative role in a series of medical experimentson human subjects at the notorious Dachau camp from 1942 through 1943. Theresearch was conducted by Luftwaffe doctors who were intent on increasing thesurvival rates of German pilots, and was strongly supported by Himmler, whofancied himself a man of science. In the first round of experiments, humanguinea pigs culled by the SS from Dachau’s ranks of the damned were forcedinside special low-oxygen chambers to determine how long Luftwaffe pilots couldfly at high altitudes before passing out. Inside the chambers, victims gaspedfor air, frantically cried out, and finally collapsed. It was up to theLuftwaffe doctor in charge of the experiments, a sadist named Siegmund Rascher,whether the victims would be revived in time or allowed to die. Rascher oversawabout 150 such high-altitude experiments, of which at least half resulted indeath.A subsequent round of medical experiments at Dachau was aimed at finding thebest ways to revive German aviators who were rescued after crashing into thefrigid North Sea. Camp inmates were forced to stand naked in freezing weatherfor up to fourteen hours. Others were submerged in tanks of iced water for threehours at a time. The subjects of the initial freezing experiments all died. Butthen the doctors added a new twist to their experiments. They “rewarmed” theirvictim in a hot bath and then revived him further with “animal heat” provided byfour female Gypsies. The victim, after being nearly frozen to death, suddenlyfound his naked body warmly embraced by four women who brought him back to life.Wolff should have been sitting in the dock at Nuremberg as part of the firstround of defendants. But it was the cruder and less-connected executioner ErnstKaltenbrunner who would hang for the sins of the SS. Nor was Wolff in the dockthe following year, when the Doctors’ Trial began, though he would be singledout by prosecutors as one of the principal “masterminds” behind the Dachauexperiments. Throughout the Nuremberg proceedings and the legal challenges thatconfronted him in later years, Wolff was watched over by his twin guardianangels—Dulles and Gero von Schulze-Gaevernitz. They made sure that the sword ofjustice never came down with its full might on SS-Obergruppenführer Karl Wolff.Among the few lives saved by the Operation Sunrise peace gambit, as it turnedout, was that of Wolff himself and those of the SS officers who conspired withhim.On May 13, 1945, shortly after the Operation Sunrise surrender, Karl Wolffcelebrated his forty-fifth birthday at the villa of the Dukes of Pistoia inBolzano, the royal estate he had requisitioned as his final SS command post.Before his lunch party began, Wolff relaxed on the villa’s terrace with his SSaide and Sunrise partner Eugen Dollmann, who had served as the interpreter forHitler and Himmler in Italy. “It’s really rather pleasant here, Eugenio,”remarked the SS-Obergruppenführer, using his affectionate name for theItaly-besotted Dollmann as the two men gazed at Wolff’s children and Dollmann’sAlsatian hound gamboling in the rose garden. But Dollmann, who could hearAmerican tanks rumbling nearby, could not let himself enjoy their idyll. “I havea feeling that this is going to be your last birthday in sunny Italy, HerrGeneral,” he remarked. Dollmann’s grave mood brought a burst of laughter fromWolff. “My dear Eugenio! You’re not going to get the wind up in these lovelysurroundings? And on my birthday too!”Shortly afterward, Wolff’s wife, Ingeborg, a tall, blond beauty and formercountess, who had left her aging, aristocratic husband for her perfect Aryanmatch, came onto the terrace and announced that lunch was ready.Dollmann’s instincts, as usual, proved correct. As Wolff and his guests—staffofficers of the Wehrmacht in dress uniform—sipped champagne in the villa’sflower-adorned entrance hall, they suddenly heard the growl of tanks outside.“The Americans,” Wolff said in a deflated voice, as he looked out the windows.Soldiers in the white helmets of military policemen burst through the doors,carrying machine guns and herding Wolff’s children in front of them. One oftheir officers, chewing a wad of gum, unceremoniously approached the SScommander and announced that he was under arrest.Wolff was aghast, protesting indignantly that Allen Dulles, the president’spersonal representative in Switzerland, had promised him “honorable treatment.”But the military police officer was unimpressed. “Put your things in a smallcase,” he snapped at Wolff, still working his Wrigley’s. “Go on, get a move on.”As the Obergruppenführer bid farewell to his wife and children outside thevilla, a mob of Italians gathered to also send the SS officers on their way,pelting Wolff and Dollmann with rocks and rotten eggs as the MPs stood bylaughing. The two Nazi VIPs were then stuffed inside an American jeep andwhisked away—first to a gloomy Bolzano dungeon and then, more hospitably, toCinecittà, the sprawling film studio in Rome that the Allies had transformedinto a POW camp.Wolff began invoking the name of Allen Dulles to anyone who would listen as soonas he was behind bars. The question of whether Dulles had promised Wolffimmunity from war crimes prosecution in return for his Sunrise collaborationwould nag the intelligence chief for many years. Dulles would repeatedly insistthat Wolff had never asked for such protection and he had never offered it.According to Dulles, the SS commander had maintained all along that he was nowar criminal and “he was willing to stand on his record.”In truth, Wolff’s growing confidence as he successfully dodged prosecution overthe following years derived from the fact that Dulles had indeed offered himimmunity. Two of the Swiss intermediaries involved in the Sunrise negotiationswould later confirm that such an arrangement had been made. Dulles’s negotiatingteam went so far as to promise Wolff that he and other “decent” and “idealistic”members of the Nazi high command would be allowed to participate in theleadership of postwar Germany. Wolff was even given to believe that he might beawarded the minister of education post.Dulles threw his cloak of protection over Wolff from the very start. The SSgeneral spent the first days of his confinement as a privileged guest of theU.S. military. He had been warned by Gaevernitz that he might have to spend sometime behind bars, to deflect any criticism of preferential treatment. But Wolffenjoyed VIP treatment, receiving better food than other prisoners and even beingallowed to wear his full uniform, complete with sidearm. In August, he wastransferred to a small U.S.-run POW camp near Gmunden, Austria—a lakeside resortknown for its health spas, featuring pinecone and salt-bath treatments.According to a highly embarrassing article that ran in the New York HeraldTribune, Wolff enjoyed a pleasant summer idyll on the lake, where he wasreunited with his family and even asked for his yacht to be delivered to him.That summer was the period of greatest jeopardy for Wolff, as the Nurembergprosecutors selected their first list of defendants and the world outcry forjustice was at its peak, on the heels of the appalling revelations about theFinal Solution. Justice Robert Jackson and the Allied legal staff consideredWolff to be a primary target, circulating a list that named him one of the“major war criminals.” With Hitler and Himmler both dead, Wolff was among thehighest Nazi officials to survive the war, clearly outranking most of thedefendants who were subsequently put on trial at Nuremberg.Determined to keep Wolff out of the defendants’ dock, however, Dulles went sofar as to bury incriminating evidence, including one particularly damning OSSreport that blamed the Nazi general not only for the “wholesale slaughter ofpopulations” and “the collective reprisals” against Italian civilians, but alsofor the torture and murder of OSS agents in his Bolzano SS headquarters. Thefeelings against Wolff were running understandably high in some OSS quarters,where the SS general was suspected of personally interrogating Americanintelligence officers. But Dulles betrayed his own men, blocking the OSS reporton Wolff from ever reaching the Nuremberg staff. Instead, it was Dulles’sportrait of Wolff as a “moderate” and a “gentleman” that was sent to theNuremberg legal team, along with a recommendation that he not be prosecuted forSS crimes.Dulles succeeded in keeping Wolff off the Nuremberg defendants list. The generalwould appear at the trial only as a witness, testifying on behalf of his fellowwar criminal Hermann Goering. But as Nuremberg prosecutors prepared for newrounds of trials, and as war crimes tribunals were organized in Italy and othercountries that had fallen under the boot of Nazi occupation, Wolff still foundhimself behind bars. Realizing that the SS general was still not safe fromprosecution, Dulles arranged for Wolff to be diagnosed with a nervous disorder,and in spring 1946 he was transferred to a psychiatric institution in Augsburg,Austria.Wolff knew that Dulles had engineered his psychiatric diagnosis to shield himfrom prosecution, but he also suspected that it was a way “to prevent me [from]talking.” The general knew that he continued to have great leverage over Dulles:if he revealed the immunity deal that the two men had worked out, thespymaster’s career would be jeopardized. Wolff was also privy to another Sunrisedirty secret: the extent to which the separate peace pact was a cold betrayal ofthe United States’ and Britain’s wartime Soviet allies. In fact, Dulles was soconcerned about what Wolff might be telling his interrogators behind bars thathe began to have his conversations secretly taped.As Wolff’s imprisonment stretched on, he grew increasingly frustrated and begantalking more freely about the “mutual understanding” that he and Dulles hadstruck and about the way he had been double-crossed. Wolff’s increasingly vocalbehavior was not lost on Dulles and the other American and British authoritiesinvolved in the Sunrise deal. At one point, his jailers quietly offered him anopen door to his freedom. But Wolff did not want the life of a rat on the run,hiding out in Argentina or Chile. He was determined to hold the Sunrise cabal totheir deal; he wanted to be fully exonerated and allowed to regain a prominentposition in the new Germany.In February 1947, Wolff played his trump card, writing a letter to PresidentTruman in which he boldly revealed the terms of the Operation Sunrise agreement.Wolff informed Truman that, in return for his cooperation on the secretsurrender, “I received from Mr. Dulles and his secretary, Mr. Gaevernitz, anexplicit promise” of freedom for himself and his fellow “meritorious” SScollaborators on the Sunrise deal. It was now time, Wolff informed Truman, forthe United States to honor the bargain made by Dulles.The German POW followed up his letter to Truman with an equally emphatic note toDulles, in which he managed to strike a tone at once courtly and threatening.Wolff insisted that Dulles must come to his aid, and that of his “entire[Sunrise] squadron,” to win their “honorable release from captivity.” His directappeal to Dulles, wrote Wolff, “is not only my right but my knightly duty”; bynegotiating secretly with the U.S. spymaster, Wolff reminded him, he had “savedyour honor and reputation . . . at the risk of our lives.”Wolff stirred the pot further by sending a similar letter to Major General LymanLemnitzer, who had worked closely with Dulles as the U.S. Army’s point man onthe Sunrise negotiations. Lemnitzer shared Dulles’s strong anti-Sovietsentiments, and he had colluded with the OSS official to keep the secret talkswith Wolff going forward, even after President Roosevelt and the Allied commandthought they had pulled the plug on Sunrise. After the German surrender, theambitious Lemnitzer had also worked with Dulles to promote Sunrise in the pressas an espionage triumph. When Wolff’s letter reached Lemnitzer, he was stationedat the Pentagon, where he had been appointed to a prestigious position with theJoint Chiefs of Staff. Lemnitzer would ultimately rise to become the Army chiefof staff under President Kennedy, where once again his career would be fatefullylinked with that of Dulles.As soon as Lemnitzer received the letter from Wolff, who appealed to him “as onegeneral to another” to make sure the Sunrise deal was honored, Lemnitzer smelledtrouble. As with his letter to Dulles, Wolff’s appeal to Lemnitzer meldedobsequious German courtesy with a flash of steel. Wolff signed off with a clearwarning, telling Lemnitzer that he was hoping to resolve the situation “as acomrade” before he was forced to air his grievances “publicly.” Lemnitzer firedoff a letter to Dulles, who was in Switzerland at the time, telling him that hewas “anxious to discuss this matter with you” as soon as Dulles returned home.Thus began a series of carefully worded letters and private discussions betweenthe two most prominent Americans who were associated with the Sunrise deal.Dulles, who was savvy enough to never put his agreement with Wolff in writing,warned Lemnitzer to be “very careful” in communicating with Wolff. “He hasproved to be a clever, tricky and wily customer,” Dulles cautioned Lemnitzer.The spymaster appeared to have a certain amount of professional respect for theway the Nazi military man had played him.The circumspect communications between Dulles and Lemnitzer led to a flurry ofbehind-the-scenes efforts on Wolff’s behalf. The last thing anyone wanted was a“sensational trial,” as Dulles put it, where Wolff would undoubtedly spill theentire Sunrise story.In March 1948, Wolff was transferred to a detention center in Hamburg, andinstead of being tried for war crimes, he was put through a much lessthreatening “denazification” hearing in a German court. Dulles supplied Wolff’sdefense team with a glowing affidavit that was read aloud in the courtroom andconcluded, “In my opinion, General Wolff’s action . . . materially contributedto bringing about the end of the war in Italy.” The ever-loyal Gaevernitz showedup as a character witness, testifying for over an hour about Wolff’s Sunriseheroism and insisting, falsely, that the SS general had never “demanded anyspecial treatment after the war.”The German court was impressed by the defendant’s influential friends. Foundguilty of the relatively minor charge of “being a member of the SS withknowledge of its criminal acts,” Wolff received a four-year sentence. ThroughDulles’s lobbying efforts, the sentence was reduced to time already served, andin June 1949, Wolff walked out of the men’s prison at Hamburg-Bergedorf a freeman. Gaevernitz and other Sunrise intermediaries were there to celebrate the warcriminal’s release. “It seemed like old times and we missed you greatly,” hewrote Dulles.One of the first actions taken by the newly liberated Wolff was to, once again,demand special treatment. He insisted that the U.S. government owed him at least$45,000 for an itemized list of clothing and family belongings that he claimedwere looted by U.S. military police from his SS palace in Bolzano after hisarrest. The demand for reparations by Himmler’s former right-hand man was, atlast, even too much for Dulles. “Between you and me,” an exasperated Dulleswrote the following year to his Swiss intelligence comrade Max Waibel, “KWdoesn’t realize what a lucky man he is not to be spending the rest of his daysin jail, and his wisest policy would be to keep fairly quiet about the loss of abit of underwear, etc. He might easily have lost more than his shirt.”Wolff’s journey now came full circle, as the middle-aged SS veteran returned tothe advertising field he had abandoned two decades earlier for a career withHitler. Landing a job as an advertising sales manager with a weekly magazine inCologne—courtesy yet again of Dulles, who had helped pave the return to civilianlife by ensuring he was not subjected to an employment ban—Wolff quickly provedto be a man on his way up. With the “circle of friends” he had made as Himmler’sbanker, Wolff found it easy to establish contacts with the advertisingdepartments of the leading German companies. As his sales soared, so did hiscommissions. By 1953, he was prosperous enough to buy a manor for his family onLake Starnberg in southern Bavaria, complete with a dock and bathhouse.Wolff’s success emboldened him. He began talking more openly about his past tofriends and even journalists. He revealed that ten days before Hitler’s suicidein a Berlin bunker, the Führer had promoted him to the rank of senior general ofthe Waffen-SS, the military wing of Himmler’s empire.The general wanted it both ways: he wanted to be seen as one of the clean andhonorable Germans, but his pride also had him crowing about his grand and loyalservice to Hitler’s Reich. Wolff’s ambivalence was highlighted again when hetold a newsletter published by an SS veterans club that Hitler had known aboutand “completely approved” of his Operation Sunrise machinations, presumably as atactic for buying time and splitting the Allies. Wolff, regarded with disdain byhis former SS colleagues for his role in Sunrise, might have been trying toingratiate himself with his old Nazi brethren. But it was a dubious claim. EugenDollmann undoubtedly came closer to the truth when he wrote in his memoir that afading Hitler—pumped full of drugs during their final meeting in the bunker—gaveWolff “a vague sort of permission to maintain the contact he had establishedwith the Americans.”In the mid-1950s, the increasingly self-assured Wolff, convinced that Germanyneeded his leadership, became politically active again. In 1953, he took a leadrole in establishing the Reichsreferat, a neofascist party, and in 1956, hebegan organizing an association of former SS officers. The old ideas cameslithering out once more: the demonization of non-Germanic races and theBolshevist menace, the glorification of power.Karl Wolff was eager to return to center stage, and who better to help his questthan his powerful American patron? Wolff had stayed in touch with Dulles throughthe U.S. occupational authorities stationed in Germany, passing him notes andbooks related to Operation Sunrise that he thought the spymaster might findinteresting. After his release from prison, Wolff had developed a side businesswith U.S. intelligence agencies, selling information to a notorious espionagefreebooter named John “Frenchy” Grombach, who had served in Army intelligence.Grombach gathered information from a far-flung network of SS old boys and otherex-Nazis in Europe, peddling it to the CIA, State Department, and corporateclients. But Wolff knew that his best connection in the American intelligenceworld was Allen Dulles himself, who by 1953 had become chief of the CIA.On May 20, 1958, Wolff marched confidently into the U.S. embassy in Bonn andasked to see two CIA officers he knew. Informed that those agents were no longerin Bonn, Wolff was escorted into the office of the CIA station chief. As usual,Wolff thoroughly charmed his host, who later reported that he “was most polite,almost ingratiating for a former General.” Wolff, the station chief added, was“sporting a tan which looked as though it had been acquired south of the Alpsand exuded prosperity.” Wolff informed his CIA host that he wanted to visit theUnited States. He wanted to see his daughter, who was married to an American,and his son, who was also residing there. He did not mention the other person hewanted to see, but it was obvious to the station chief. Everyone in the agency’supper ranks knew about the CIA director’s long and intricate history with Wolff.Chatting with the Bonn station chief, Wolff soon got to the point. He wantedassurances that he would have no trouble securing a visa for his visit to theUnited States. Informed about his old wartime collaborator’s wishes, Dullespulled strings on his behalf in Washington. But the two men were never to bereunited in America. Karl Wolff’s name still stirred too much unease in thebowels of Washington’s bureaucracy. Some foreign service functionaries beganasking awkward questions about the general’s wartime activities. There were somespecters from the past, realized Dulles, that were best left in the past, to beconjured only in one’s smoothly crafted memoirs."},{"pageContent":"5 [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-14]RATLINES [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-14]Karl Wolff was not the only prominent SS officer who greatly benefited fromDulles’s Operation Sunrise. In the fall of 1945, former SS colonel EugenDollmann, Wolff’s principal intermediary during the Sunrise negotiations, foundhimself living in a gilded cage in Rome. The apartment, which was located on ViaArchimede, a quiet, horseshoe-shaped street in the city’s exclusive Pariolidistrict, contained few distractions for the bored Dollmann. But he did discoveran extensive sadomasochistic literary collection left behind by the formertenant, a German mistress of Mussolini, and he whiled away the hours readingabout feverishly inventive ways to mortify the flesh. Dollmann was not anentirely free man, since he was a guest of U.S. intelligence officers. But, eventhough he remained under close surveillance, compared to his accommodationsafter he and Karl Wolff were arrested in May, the colonel’s Parioli lifestylewas sublime.Before he was spirited off to Rome by the Strategic Services Unit, the agencythat replaced the disbanded OSS after the war, the Nazi diplomat had beeninstalled in a temporary cell at Cinecittà Studios. Spoiled by years of the bestItalian cuisine, Dollmann found the rations at Cinecittà so distasteful that heconsidered joining a hunger strike started by fellow POW Gudrun Himmler, thelate Reichsführer’s daughter. Then he was transferred to a POW camp in Ascona,on picturesque Lake Maggiore, where the daily fare—consisting mainly of waterypea soup—was even more objectionable, and the inmates were forced to sleep intents that floated away in heavy downpours. Dollmann later had the nerve tocompare Ascona to Dachau. “At least in Dachau they had wooden huts,” heobserved.Relief for Dollmann came when he was transferred to a low-security prison camprun by the British military in Rimini, on the Adriatic coast. One night,Dollmann found it remarkably easy—one American intelligence agent would call it“suspiciously” easy—to cut through the wires encircling Rimini and flee toMilan, where he knew he would find sanctuary. Here Dollmann presented himself tothe well-connected cardinal Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster in the prelate’s palazzoadjoining the enormous Gothic cathedral. Dollmann, known as one of Rome’s moreelegant peacocks during his SS glory days, now sat before the eminent cardinalin a filthy raincoat, looking the worse for wear after his frantic trek fromRimini.As they sipped liqueur from long-stemmed glasses, Dollmann reflected on how thecardinal always put him in mind of “a delicate alabaster statue.” But Schuster,who had worked with Wolff’s SS team on the Sunrise deal, was not as refined asall that. The wily cardinal was part of the Vatican elite that had collaboratedwith Mussolini’s fascist regime—and, out of self-interest, he was inclined tohelp Dollmann now, to avoid an embarrassing war crimes trial. Besides, Schusterthought that men like Dollmann might still play a useful role in postwar Italy;he hoped to recruit the former SS officer in the campaign against the Church’snemesis, the Italian Communists, who had emerged from the war as a powerfulpolitical force.Dollmann, who was conniving by nature but not political, was uninterested in thecardinal’s plot, but he was in no position to quibble. He allowed himself to besafely hidden away in a Church-run asylum for wealthy drug addicts, where hisfellow inmates included a fading Italian film diva and an emotionally fragileduchess. As he languished among the delicato junkies, Dollmann decided to samplesome of the forbidden fruit that the screen siren kept stashed in her room,snorting a snowy mound of heroin. For a time, Dollmann—who had much to forget inhis life, but was plagued by a detailed memory—seemed in danger of disappearingamong the lotus eaters.Salvation came in the form of James Jesus Angleton, a rising young star in U.S.intelligence who had run the X-2 branch (OSS counterintelligence) in Italyduring the war and had stayed behind to use his wiles against the Communists.After tracking down Dollmann in the Milan asylum, Angleton sent a big U.S. ArmyBuick with a chauffeur to pick him up and drive him to the Eternal City, wherehe installed Dollmann in the Via Archimede safe house in the Parioli district.Counterintelligence was the spy craft’s deepest mind game—it was not justfiguring out the enemy’s next moves in advance and blocking them, but learningto think like him. Not yet thirty, Angleton was already being talked about inAmerican and British intelligence circles as one of the masters of the field. Hehad been educated in British prep schools and at Yale, where he had edited theavant-garde poetry magazine Furioso and courted the likes of Ezra Pound and e.e.cummings as contributors, and he seemed to bring an artist’s intuition to hisprofession. But he could get lost in the convolutions of his own fevered mind,which drove him to prowl the streets of Rome late at night in a black overcoatso big it looked like a cape, on the hunt for clues about the growing Communistmenace, and to crawl around on his office floor at 69 Via Sicilia in search ofhidden bugging devices.Angleton was as gaunt as a saint. (His wife, Cicely, would rhapsodize about his“El Greco face.” His colleagues called Angleton “the Cadaver.”) He smokedincessantly, and his bony frame was wracked by consumptive fits of coughing.When he introduced himself to Dollmann, Angleton must have struck the colonel asyet another strung-out soul. But Angleton’s addiction was of a more ideologicalnature.As Angleton sat with Dollmann in the comfortable, five-room apartment on ViaArchimede, the young spy explained his vision for the new world. Dollmann feltbound to listen politely, since Angleton had gone to the trouble of plucking himfrom Cardinal Schuster’s madhouse. But Dollmann had heard it all before—witheven more fervor—from the Führer himself and his SS overlords: how Bolshevismmust be crushed for the new world to be born, why there must be no rules in aclash like this between civilization and barbarity.Angleton, however, was lost in his own passion. He had found strong support forhis views from Allen Dulles in the months after the war, as Dulles lingered inEurope, hoping that President Truman would anoint him commander of the shadowwar against the Soviet Union. In October 1945, Dulles visited Rome with Clover,ostensibly to revive their marriage after the strains of separation during thewar. But he had another mission as well: to organize the Italian front in thenew Cold War. Angleton, who was wired into the Vatican, helped arrange a secretmeeting for Dulles with Pope Pius XII, who had maintained a mutually beneficialarrangement with Mussolini’s regime and was a determined foe of Communism.Angleton looked up to Dulles as a mentor—a powerful figure in the mold of hisadored father, James Hugh Angleton, an international businessman who had pavedhis son’s path into the spy trade and continued to play an influential role inthe young spook’s life. Dulles would remain a strong, paternal figure forAngleton junior throughout their deeply entwined intelligence careers. In Rome,the two men conferred about the growing “Red challenge” and “the drastic,sub-rosa measures required to meet it,” as a colleague put it. These extrememeasures included recruiting agents “without overscrupulous concern for [their]past fascist affiliations.”Dollmann was high on their list of such recruitment targets. With hiscontinental sophistication and network of contacts, Dollmann might prove avaluable espionage asset on the strategic front lines in both Italy and Germany.As Angleton sat with the well-groomed colonel in the Via Archimede safe housenow, the American opened a bottle of Scotch whisky that he had brought along andcarried on with his enthusiastic recruitment pitch. But as he listened, sippingthe good Scotch, Dollmann was filled with utter contempt for his guest. “He wastalking like a young university lecturer who dabbled a bit in espionage in hisspare time,” mused the colonel. His views struck the world-weary German astypically American—naïve and overblown.As for Dulles, Dollmann had only contempt for his benefactor, whom he latercalled “a leather-faced Puritan archangel . . . [the type] who had fled from theEuropean sink of iniquity on the Mayflower and now returned to scourge thesinners of the old world.” He would ridicule the way that Dulles hadmisrepresented himself at their secret Sunrise meetings in Switzerland asPresident Roosevelt’s personal emissary, delivering little speeches to Wolff andDollmann about how “delighted” FDR supposedly was about the SS officers’selfless mission for peace. “Wasn’t that nice now?” sneered Dollmann. “Suchmanly, upright and heartening words from President Roosevelt and his specialrepresentative in Europe, Mr. Allen W. Dulles!”While Dollmann was unimpressed with Angleton’s political lecture, he didappreciate the fake identity card the young spy gave him. The document—whichidentified him as an Italian employee of an American organization—affordedDollmann the confidence to venture into the streets of his beloved Rome withoutfear of being molested by the authorities. Sprung from his apartment, thecolonel found himself drawn to some of his favorite old haunts. He strolledthrough the fashionable Via Condotti shopping district, where he paid a visit tothe Bulgari jewelry shop.In the old days, he had been treated like royalty by the Bulgari brothers, whowould take him on tours of their vaults beneath the Tiber River, where there wasa red room for rubies, a blue room for sapphires, and a green room for emeralds.The Bulgaris would pour him Napoleon brandy as they showed off the crown jewelsof the late czar and other dazzling treasures. But those pleasant days were longgone. This time, when he suddenly appeared in the luxury shop, Giorgio Bulgarigreeted him as if he were a ghost. “We were all afraid you had been killed,” thejeweler told Dollmann, after he recovered from his shock.During the war, Giorgio Bulgari had been so revolted by the deportation ofRome’s Jews—an order stamped by Dollmann’s boss, Wolff—that he and his wife hidthree Jewish women in their own home. Now, gazing at the resurrected SS colonel,the jeweler undoubtedly wished Dollmann was dead. And Dollmann knew it.Afraid he’d been killed? That was rich. Bulgari’s false concern infuriatedDollmann, but he adopted his usual droll manner. “How very amusing. People likeme don’t just disappear forever like that.”Dollmann always liked to give the impression that he was too cosmopolitan toindulge in the Nazis’ anti-Jewish mania. But now he felt offended by Bulgari’sforced courtesy; Bulgari “sickened” him—he was a “corpulent Levantine . . .[with] fleshy lips [and a] greasy smile.” Dollmann turned abruptly and fled theshop.Once upon a time, Dollmann had had a love affair with Italy, and he was certainthat his sunny “arcadia,” as he called it, returned his ardor. But now he was nolonger certain. Dollmann had arrived in Italy two decades earlier, long beforethe war, as a young graduate student in Renaissance history. The young Germanwas well educated, fluent in Italian, and boasted some sort of connection to thedoomed Habsburg dynasty. He was also gay and charming, and he quickly shed asmuch of his stolid German upbringing as he could in favor of la dolce vita. Withhis slickly groomed hair, sleek Italian suits, and year-round tan, Dollmann wentcompletely native, becoming Eugenio instead of Eugen.Dollmann had been embraced by the German diplomatic set in Rome, who appreciatedhis nuanced grasp of the local language and customs, and by the Italianaristocratic set, who found him an amusing decoder of all things Deutsch. Hisbinational skills were increasingly in demand as the two countries’ fates grewmore closely linked. He was sought out by a principessa named Donna Vittoria,who was the reigning queen of Roman salons. Her soirees, held at herotherworldly palazzo in the imperial ruins of Teatro Marcello, were frequentedby Mussolini’s daughter Edda and her husband, Count Ciano, as well as theleading Italian film stars of the day. She very much hoped to have Hitler, too,as an honored guest someday, the principessa confided to Dollmann.In Naples, he was invited to the midnight entertainments at Duchess Rosalba’sdecaying mansion, festivities so lavishly debauched that they could haveinspired a young Fellini. One night the lady of the house greeted Dollmann asshe reclined on a divan and was attended to by two slyly grinning female dwarvesand a well-built retainer packed into a form-fitting suit. The dwarves laterappeared on a stage with a troupe of other diminutive performers, who enacted along and baroque melodrama for the amusement of Duchess Rosalba’s guests.Dollmann was haunted not just by the odd performance but by the strange smilethat his hostess fixed on him. The duchess, he noted, had “a simultaneouslycharming and inhuman mouth.” He later learned the story of her deformity. Theduchess liked to prowl Naples’s rough waterfront bars for her handsome henchmen,replacing them in quick succession with one rugged seaman after another. Onenight she was attacked with a knife by one such jealous sailor, who left themark of his fury on her once beautiful face.But not even this decadent world could prepare Dollmann for the life he beganwhen he joined the SS, where he would rise to become the link between the courtsof Hitler and Mussolini. Dollmann later tried to make sense of why he hadenlisted in Himmler’s death’s-head corps. It wasn’t political ambition thatdrove him—he insisted that he had none. And it wasn’t monetary reward. “I[already] lived well and comfortably, and my life, after I had yielded to myso-called motives, was no better than before, only more arduous.” Was it the wayhe looked in his trimly tailored SS uniform? Vanity was always a factor withDollmann. Years later, he proudly displayed photos of himself standing in thevery center of history, between Hitler and his visiting Italian dignitaries,gazing into the Führer’s magnetic eyes, ready to translate his every momentousword. Dollmann, always up to date on the latest Rome gossip, became a courtfavorite of Hitler. He was at the Führer’s side whenever Hitler and his retinuedescended on Italy, and he was there whenever Mussolini or his top ministerstrekked to summits in Germany.By serving as the essential diplomatic link between Germany and Italy, Dollmannensured that his sojourn in his adopted land would not be interrupted by thecoming war. Dollmann would point to this as the primary reason why he made hisFaustian bargain. Italia was the great passion of his life. “I loved Italy withthe doomed love of all German romantics.”It was the most peculiar of ironies, and one that Dollmann and his intimates nodoubt privately relished. The man who kept the Axis partners smoothly aligned,with his impressive language and social skills, was a highly educated,arts-loving homosexual who enjoyed trading in the most salacious gossip aboutthe personalities who ruled Germany and Italy. Dollmann was, in short, preciselythe type of person the Nazis sent to the gas chambers. But instead, Hitler’sinterpreter was free to attend gay and lesbian orgies in Venice, a city whoseshadows offered some protection from the authorities’ prying eyes. And he hadthe pleasure of going on shopping safaris with Eva Braun, Hitler’s companion,during her Italian holidays.Braun was mad for crocodile shoes and accessories. “She loved crocodile in everyshape and form, and returned to her hotel looking as if she had come back from atrip up the Congo rather than along the Tiber.”Dollmann was fond of Braun, a sweet and simple young woman who confided her sadlife to him. She was known throughout the world as the German strongman’smistress, but, as she confessed to Dollmann, there was no sexual intimacybetween her and the Führer. “He is a saint,” Braun told Dollmann wistfully. “Theidea of physical contact would be for him to defile his mission. Many times wesit and watch the sun come up after spending the whole night talking. He says tome that his only love is Germany and to forget it, even for a moment, wouldshatter the mystical forces of his mission.”Dollmann strongly suspected that the Führer had other passions besides Germany.On Christmas Eve 1923, when he was a university student in Munich, Dollmann hadbeen invited to an extravagant, candlelit party at the home of General Otto vonLossow, who had helped put down Hitler’s Beer Hall putsch in November 1923.During the evening, Lossow took Dollmann and some of his other guests into hisparlor, where he entertained them by reading selections from Hitler’s thickpolice dossier. “In a café near the university on the evening of, Herr Hitlerwas observed . . .” Lossow’s voice was matter-of-fact as he read through thedepositions and eyewitness reports about Germany’s future leader. The general’ssmall audience listened in rapt silence, transfixed by the portrait of a Hitlerwho was more interested in boyish men than in national politics.These were the sorts of tales that Dollmann kept tucked away—stories that wouldhelp the consummate survivor navigate what he called the “witches’ cauldron” ofRome as well as Berlin’s dark labyrinth. As the Nazis’ main fixer in Rome, ithelped to know everything he could about the dangerous men with whom he wasdealing.The Nazi official Dollmann most dreaded escorting around Italy was ReinhardHeydrich, Himmler’s top executioner. “Now there was a man clearly meant to bemurdered by someone or other,” Dollmann observed years later. “He was a daemonicpersonality, a Lucifer with cold blue eyes.” One night, Heydrich demanded thatDollmann take him to Naples’s finest brothel. Two dozen half-naked womenrepresenting the full spectrum of the female form—from “slim gazelles to buxomRubenesque beauties”—were arranged for Heydrich’s inspection in the brothel’sornate lobby, with its gilt-edged mirrors and frescoes of rosy nymphs. Heydrichgazed at the women on display with his blank, shark eyes. Considering the SSbutcher’s reputation, Dollmann did not know what to expect next. SuddenlyHeydrich flung a fistful of shiny gold coins across the marble floor. “Then hejumped up, Lucifer personified, and clapped his hands. With a sweeping gesture,he invited the girls to pick up the gold. A Walpurgisnacht orgy ensued. Fat andthin, ponderous and agile, the [women] scrambled madly across the salotto flooron all fours.”Afterward, Heydrich looked pale and spent, as if he himself had joined in thefrenzy. He coolly thanked Dollmann and disappeared into the night. Theinterpreter was glad to see Heydrich go. He was, said Dollmann, “the only man Iinstinctively feared.”History has come to judge Eugen Dollmann as “a self-serving opportunist whoprostituted himself to fascism,” in the words of legal scholar Michael Salter,but not a fanatic like the men he served. Nevertheless, as war criminalproceedings got under way in Nuremberg in the fall of 1945, Dollmann knew thathe was at high risk of prosecution. The Nuremberg trials, where Foreign MinisterJoachim von Ribbentrop and Ambassador Franz von Papen were both convicted,firmly established that diplomats like Dollmann who moved in rarefied Nazicircles were not immune from judicial reckoning.Dollmann was perhaps at even greater risk in Italy, where passions ran highregarding Nazi massacres of Italian civilians, such as the infamous slaughter of335 prisoners in the Ardeatine Caves near Rome in March 1944. Although RobertoRossellini modeled the effeminate, sadistic SS captain Bergmann on Dollmann inhis postwar film Rome, Open City, Dollmann was not directly involved in theArdeatine atrocity; in reality, the colonel had no taste for brutality. Afterthe war, Dollmann claimed that he had once even rescued several Italianpartisans who were being burned alive by fascist thugs. Regardless of his degreeof guilt or innocence, however, Dollmann was the most visible symbol of the Nazioccupation of Rome. Italians were all too familiar with the numerous newspaperphotos of his slim, ben vestito figure taken at social events in Mussolini’sPalazzo Quirinale or the Vatican. In the fall of 1945, as he strolled aroundRome with his fake ID card, Dollmann was acutely aware that if he fell into thewrong hands—particularly those of Italian Communists—he could be lynched.Dollmann’s anxieties were heightened when American agents installed two formerSS colleagues in his Rome apartment—including the notorious Colonel WalterRauff, who had served as Karl Wolff’s second-in-command in northernItaly—because he knew that the hideout might now attract increased interest fromNazi hunters. Dollmann, who regarded Rauff as “one of my most disagreeableacquaintances,” was well aware of his new roommate’s past. In 1941, Rauff hadoverseen the development and operation of a fleet of “Black Raven” vans, inwhich victims were sealed inside and asphyxiated with exhaust fumes. As many as250,000 people on the war’s eastern front were murdered in Rauff’s vehicles,which were eventually replaced by the gas chambers of Auschwitz and Dachau. “Inmy opinion,” Dollmann mordantly remarked, “he was quite certainly due for thehigh jump [at Nuremberg] when they got round to him.” But Rauff had managed tosave his neck by prudently jumping on board the Operation Sunrise bandwagon withWolff.Weary of his roommate’s baleful presence, Dollmann often fled the Via Archimedeapartment to go to the movies. As he sat in the dark day after day, he begangetting the prickling sensation that he was being followed. One afternoon inNovember 1946, as the colonel watched a trifle titled Kisses You Dream Of at hisneighborhood cinema, Dollmann felt a firm hand on his shoulder and heard a voiceof authority: “Kindly leave the cinema with me.” He was taken into custody by aplainclothes detective who was accompanied by two armed carabinieri and thenwhisked away to a nearby police station.Dollmann and his fellow SS escapees had been tracked for months by the 428thU.S. Army Counterintelligence Corps (CIC), a detachment of Nazi hunters based inRome. Major Leo Pagnotta, the Italian American who was second-in-command of theCIC unit, was a sharp investigator. He figured out that Dollmann, who knew itwas unwise to show his face too much on the streets, would sooner or laterreconnect with the Italian chauffeur who had driven him around during his SSdays. Dollmann did indeed contact the chauffeur, but Pagnotta had gotten to himfirst, making him an offer he couldn’t refuse. “If you see Dollmann and youdon’t tell me,” Pagnotta had told the driver, “I’ll arrest you and you’ll beshot.” The chauffeur quickly gave up Dollmann, pinpointing when and where hewould be dropped off at the cinema.Now, as Dollmann sat waiting in the police station holding room, the doorsuddenly opened and Major Pagnotta walked in. The two men took an immediatedislike to each other. Dollmann was predisposed to look down on Americans, whomhe found in general to be a crass, illiterate, and mongrelized people. To makematters worse, this one was “rather fat”—a cardinal sin with Dollmann—and theAmerican didn’t bother with any social niceties, treating the Nazi fugitive like“a pretty low sort of criminal.”The situation appeared bleak for Dollmann—his next stop could well be Nuremberg.But he knew that he had an ace up his sleeve, and he immediately played it.Dollmann took a piece of paper from his pocket and handed it to Pagnotta.“Please call this number,” he told him. “Ask for Major Angleton. He knows who Iam.”Major Pagnotta was quite familiar with Major Angleton. In fact, Pagnotta’s teamof Nazi hunters was headquartered in the same building on Via Sicilia asAngleton’s rival intelligence operation, the Strategic Services Unit’s X-2branch. Pagnotta’s CIC unit was on the first floor, Angleton was on the second,and British intelligence was on the third. Pagnotta and his men didn’t trustAngleton—they thought he was “a devious and arrogant son of a bitch,” in thewords of Pagnotta’s aide William Gowen. Angleton seemed to work more closelywith the British spies than with his U.S. Army colleagues, and the Britishtreated him like one of their own. Before transferring to Rome in 1944, Angletonhad been stationed in London, where his X-2 unit was overseen by Britishintelligence.The espionage scene in postwar Rome was rife with rivalries and competingagendas. Some U.S. intelligence units, such as Leo Pagnotta’s, were determinedNazi hunters. But other operatives, such as Angleton, had very differentobjectives. This spy-versus-spy atmosphere made Pagnotta’s investigative workextremely complicated.As Pagnotta tracked top Nazi fugitives in Italy, many of whom had escaped fromthe British-run prisoner-of-war camp in Rimini, it became clear to him that hewas often working at cross-purposes with Angleton and British intelligence. Oneof the most notorious fugitives, SS captain Karl Hass, who had overseen theArdeatine Caves massacre, mysteriously escaped every time Pagnotta’s teamtracked him down and turned him over to British occupational authorities inItaly. Finally, after his fourth arrest, Hass escaped for good. It was not untilmany years later that Hass was tracked down in Argentina and extradited to standtrial in Italy for his role in the massacre. Hass received a life sentence, butby then he was an old man, and his failing health kept him out of prison.Unsurprisingly, after capturing Dollmann, Pagnotta decided to hang on to him,placing him in a U.S. military prison in Rome instead of handing him over to theBritish. In the beginning, Dollmann was a cooperative prisoner, readilyrevealing the address of his apartment on Via Archimede. When Pagnotta’s teamraided the apartment, they narrowly missed catching Dollmann’s infamous roommateWalter Rauff, who managed to flee to Bari, on the Adriatic coast, where heboarded a ship for Alexandria, Egypt—the next stop in the Nazi exterminator’slong and winding ratline. Rauff would cap his bloody career in Chile, where hebecame a top adviser to DINA, military dictator Augusto Pinochet’s own Gestapo.When Rauff died in 1984—at age seventy-seven, after successfully rebuffing yearsof extradition attempts—hundreds of aging Nazis flocked to his funeral inSantiago, where he was laid to rest amid loud salutes of “Heil Hitler!”Pagnotta did snare another fugitive who was living in the Via Archimedeapartment, SS officer Eugen Wenner, who had also played a part in the OperationSunrise maneuvers. It soon dawned on Pagnotta’s team that Angleton was operatinga safe house on Via Archimede for a stream of Nazi fugitives who were connectedto Sunrise and other Dulles operations. They even traced the car driven byDollmann’s chauffeur to Angleton’s father, who kept a villa nearby in Parioli.Nobody would get to know the deeply clever ways of Angleton in Rome better thanWilliam Gowen, who, at age eighteen, was one of the youngest members ofPagnotta’s crew of Nazi hunters.It was only a matter of time before Jim Angleton—who made it his business tomeet the important people in postwar Rome—crossed paths with Bill Gowen, who,despite his youth, was known to be well connected. Gowen’s father, Franklin, wasa career diplomat who had served under Ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy in Londonand was currently the assistant to Myron C. Taylor, the former U.S. Steelchairman whom FDR had appointed as his special representative to the Vaticanduring the war. Gowen’s family had money—one of his ancestors had been presidentof the Philadelphia Stock Exchange—but they were by tradition Democrats.Roosevelt was fond of Franklin Gowen, whom he regarded as one of the fewblue-blooded members of the diplomatic corps he could trust.The younger Gowen brought a special sense of mission to his Armycounterintelligence job. His family owned property in Italy and had deep rootsthere. His grandfather Morris was living in Florence when war broke out.Although he was Episcopalian, Morris Gowen was denounced as a Jew and put on atrain for Auschwitz. When the Germans realized he was American, he was taken offthe train in northern Italy and put in an SS encampment, where theseventy-seven-year-old man died in July 1944 of what his death certificatestated was “exhaustion.” Bill Gowen’s family had a number of Jewish familyfriends in Italy who suffered similar fates. “When I got to Rome in 1946 as ayoung soldier,” he later remarked, “I didn’t need to read about the Nazi terror.My family had been touched by it.”All in all, young Bill Gowen had a pedigree that Angleton clearly found bothappealing and threatening. Gowen’s dedication as a war crimes investigator poseda distinct problem for Angleton, who viewed Nazi fugitives like Dollmann andRauff in more pragmatic terms. And the Gowen family’s Italian background alsoinfringed on Angleton’s turf. “I think that between the father and son, theAngletons thought they had a lock on Italy, and on the Vatican,” Gowen observed.“Jim Angleton was very jealous of my family, because he wanted to have amonopoly on Italy. And anything that might threaten him had to be taken careof.”Angleton made a point of keeping Gowen close in Rome. In early 1947, Gowen andhis father were invited to the Italian wedding of Angleton’s sister, Carmen,where Angleton chatted up the younger Gowen and insisted they meet for lunchsomeday. They got together soon afterward at Angleton’s favorite spot, a Jewishrestaurant near Rome’s once thriving ghetto. Angleton was fond of therestaurant’s house specialty—carciofi fritti—and he took charge of ordering whenthe waiter arrived at their table. To Gowen’s surprise, however, Angleton—whopresented himself as an expert on all things Italian—displayed so little masteryof the language that his younger lunch companion had to take over communicationwith the puzzled waiter. Gowen, who was born in his family’s Livorno villa, wasimpressively fluent in the local tongue. It was yet another thing that Angletonfound irritating about Gowen.Lunch companions like Bill Gowen always made Angleton uneasy. Gowen—whose familywas filled with bankers, lawyers, diplomats, and Episcopalian ministers—had asolid Social Register background. And, despite his tender age, he was already aman of the world, having shuttled around Europe’s diplomatic posts with hisfather. With his cheery mid-Atlantic accent and his continental sartorial flair,Gowen seemed born and bred for the top tier.Angleton was also raised in wealth. But his father, Hugh, was not the Main Linetype. He was a swashbuckling, self-made man who had swept up his future wife,Carmen, when she was a teenager in Mexico, after he joined General John “BlackJack” Pershing’s 1916 expedition to capture Pancho Villa. Despite youngAngleton’s British affectations, his face would always carry traces of hissouth-of-the-border heritage. Even as he rose to the top ranks of the U.S.intelligence establishment, he remained something of an outsider in thatthoroughly WASPy world, marked not just by his brilliant, idiosyncraticpersonality but by his mixed ethnicity. Angleton was, in short, what his Naziassociates would call a mongrelized American.Gowen might have been Angleton’s social superior, with much better connectionsto the Roosevelt and Truman administrations, but in the end it was Angleton whoprevailed in the spy games. In May 1947, after Dollmann had spent several bleakmonths in prison in Rome, Angleton succeeded in outwitting Pagnotta and Gowenand getting the former SS colonel transferred to a U.S. military prison inFrankfurt, where he was safe from the wrath of Italian political enemies andprosecutors. The clever Angleton had Dollmann smuggled out of his Roman cell ona stretcher. In Germany, Dollmann was soon switched to even more agreeableaccommodations: a cozy guesthouse in the lush Main countryside that he sharedwith other former Nazi VIPs, such as the notorious propagandist “Axis Sally,”and Otto Skorzeny, the scar-faced Waffen-SS colonel who was famous for a daringglider raid that rescued Mussolini from mountaintop captivity. By November,after the U.S. military released him from incarceration, Dollmann was acompletely free man.There was sharp disagreement over suspected war criminals like Dollmann withinthe U.S. military command overseeing the occupation of Germany. General GeorgePrice Hays, a decorated officer who led the 10th Mountain Division’s assault onMonte Cassino during the Allies’ Italian campaign and commanded the 2nd InfantryDivision’s artillery on Omaha Beach during D-day, was angered by the kid-glovetreatment given Dulles’s Sunrise Nazis. Hays, who became high commissioner forthe U.S. occupation zone in Germany, tartly pointed out in a November 1947 memothat it was the U.S. Army that was responsible for the surrender of Nazi troopsin Italy, not Dulles’s secret maneuvers. Hays was adamantly opposed to grantingamnesty to “possible war criminals or war profiteers” like Dollmann, which, heobserved, would “condone their crimes without proper examination.” Nonetheless,by 1947, many in the American military hierarchy shared the Dulles-Angleton viewthat fighting Communism was a bigger priority than prosecuting fascist warcriminals.Even after securing Dollmann’s release, Angleton remained nervous about BillGowen. The young man knew too much about Angleton’s string-pulling on behalf ofDollmann and the other Nazi fugitives who had been harbored on Via Archimede.Angleton suspected that Gowen’s CIC unit kept extensive files on the ratlinesthat had allowed Sunrise collaborators like Dollmann and Rauff to escapejustice. He was determined to see what was in those files—an interestundoubtedly shared by Angleton’s mentor, Dulles, as well as their allies in theU.S. intelligence complex.In November 1947, as Dollmann walked free, the U.S. military moved to shut downits Nazi-hunting operation in Rome. That month, Bill Gowen hopped a train forFrankfurt, which was to be his new base of operations. By the time theslow-moving train crawled into the Frankfurt station, it was after midnight. Ajeep driven by a hulking soldier with CIC insignia on his uniform was waitingfor Gowen, who threw his duffel bag into the vehicle and jumped in.Frankfurt was still pulverized from the war. One of the few buildings leftmiraculously untouched by Allied bombing was the massive IG Farben complex,which now served as the headquarters of the Supreme Allied Command. The city’sdemolished landscape was illuminated only by scattered pinpoints of light, andthe darkness closed in on Gowen and his driver as the jeep pulled away from thetrain platform.“I guess you’re tired,” the driver said. “You’ll want to go to a hotel.”Gowen, exhausted from the long train ride, nodded emphatically. But instead ofheading toward a hotel, the soldier drove deeper into the city’s ruins. Now theonly light came from the jeep’s headlamps.“Where are we going?” asked Gowen.“I just want to show you something,” said the soldier. There was nothing to beseen, only dark piles of rubble.“I’ve been to Germany before—I just want to go to bed,” Gowen said.But the jeep kept creeping slowly through the night shadows. Suddenly the drivercame to a halt, jumped out, and told Gowen to follow him. Gowen didn’t like hissituation. “He was armed and I wasn’t. I was alarmed, and I’m normally notscared.” Gowen cautiously followed the soldier, walking slowly behind him intothe gloom. Gowen didn’t know how far they had walked when the soldier abruptlyturned around and headed back to the jeep. When they got to the vehicle, Gowenimmediately realized that his duffel bag was missing.“I wasn’t dumb enough to ask him where my bag was,” Gowen recalled years later.“I knew what had happened. I knew what they were looking for.” As it turned out,there were no intelligence files in Gowen’s stolen bag. But the story wasn’tover.In January 1948, while Gowen was still stationed in Germany with Armyintelligence, he received a transatlantic phone call from syndicated columnistDrew Pearson. The influential Washington journalist told Gowen that he wasworking on a hot scoop and that Gowen was at the center of it. Pearson was goingto report that Ferenc Vajta, a fugitive from war crimes charges in Hungary,where he had worked as an anti-Semitic propagandist for the fascist Arrow CrossParty, had slipped into the United States illegally—with the help of young Nazihunter Bill Gowen. Pearson claimed he had proof: documents that showed Gowen hadworked closely with Vajta on various covert missions. As he listened to Pearson,Gowen was so flabbergasted that he didn’t know what to say. Pearson’s exclusivestory ran in newspapers across America on January 18 and was amplified furtherby his coast-to-coast radio broadcast.There was some truth to Pearson’s report. Gowen did indeed know Vajta from hisdays in Rome, when he had used the Hungarian as an informer to help track thenotorious Croatian fugitive Ante Pavelic´, the fascist leader of the Ustašemovement who led a genocidal campaign in the Balkans during the war that was soextreme he had to be restrained by German authorities. With the help of FerencVajta, Gowen had traced Pavelic´ to a villa atop the Aventine Hill. Pavelic´ wasunder the protection of Croatian officials in the Vatican and other fascistsympathizers. From his villa, Pavelic´ was able to sneak into nearby safe housesthrough a series of secret passageways that honeycombed the Aventine.Gowen was perfectly willing to rely on lesser criminals like Vajta to locatemuch bigger targets like Pavelic´. But he had had nothing to do with providingVajta a special State Department security clearance and slipping him into theUnited States. That sleight of hand was likely performed by Frank Wisner, aclose collaborator of Dulles’s from their days in the OSS who had recently beenappointed head of the State Department’s clandestine operations unit, the Officeof Policy Coordination.But it was Gowen who would take the fall for the Vajta escapade. It did not takehim long to figure out who was responsible for setting him up. Pearson had beenfed the false story by Raymond Rocca, Angleton’s deputy in Rome.Pearson’s exposé effectively ended Gowen’s budding intelligence career. Gowennever stopped trying to clear his name. At one point, he managed to get anappointment to see Dulles after Dulles became CIA director, but when Gowenshowed up at the agency’s headquarters in Washington to plead his case, he wastold that the spymaster had been called overseas.Years after both men returned to America, Angleton continued to keep an eye onGowen. Back in Washington, where he eventually became the all-powerful chief ofCIA counterintelligence, Angleton invited Gowen to lunch at the Army-Navy Cluband even to his home in Virginia. “You know, he was a very devious character,”Gowen said, “but he wanted to give me the impression that he was very friendly.He introduced me to his wife, Cicely, and their children, who were very young atthe time.” Angleton’s betrayal of Gowen hovered silently in the air. “I neverdiscussed it openly with him, I never trusted Angleton enough to do that.” Bothmen knew who had won the power struggle in Rome. But they also knew that thesecret history they shared had the power to undo Angleton’s grand career andexpose the underside of Sunrise.Intelligence reports do not normally make for entertaining reading. Few stationchiefs come close to having the literary touch of onetime spies like GrahamGreene, David Cornwell (John le Carré), or Ian Fleming. But, following hisrelease from U.S. military detention in 1947, Eugen Dollmann’s espionage careerbecame such a flamboyant mess that he inspired some of the most colorfulmemoranda ever produced by the U.S. intelligence bureaucracy. Reading throughthese declassified CIA documents fills one with awe for Dollmann’s endlesspowers of reinvention, and a sense of wonder as to why men as knowing as Dullesand Angleton ever saw him as spy material.U.S. surveillance of Dollmann began getting interesting in 1951, when he waslocated in a suite at the posh Hotel Paradiso, overlooking Lake Lugano inSwitzerland, near northern Italy. By then, the colonel’s high life was beginningto catch up with him. He was reported to be in financial distress and lookingfor ways to make some quick cash. Among the schemes he was pondering was writinghis memoirs—which he was promising would be dishy—and hustling various Nazidocuments he claimed were authentic, including some supposedly written byHitler. The colonel was shaking down the CIA for 200,000 lire in return for the“exclusive” rights to examine the documents.Dulles and the CIA knew that there was great potential for embarrassment withDollmann. As the years passed, the agency’s memos on the colorful SS veteranrevealed rising levels of anxiety and exasperation.In November 1951, Dollmann was reported to be in “close contact” with DonaldJones, which was an intriguing twist, since Jones was the OSS daredevil whomDulles had asked to rescue Karl Wolff from the Italian partisans during the war.Jones was “still presumed to be an agent of U.S. intelligence,” but the memomade clear that Dollmann’s contact with him was not strictly professional. “Thetwo are now divided because of a quarrel, presumed to have originated over aquestion of money, or perhaps jealousy, since both are suspected of being sexualperverts.” The memo concluded that Dollmann’s value as “an agent or informer”was “uncertain . . . he is not the man he was in 1940–45.”Dollmann, no doubt, would have readily agreed. For one thing, he had less money.And he was stuck in purgatory in Switzerland rather than enjoying the sweet lifein his beloved Italy because U.S. agents had warned him they still could notguarantee his safety there.Nonetheless, Dollmann would soon find himself in Italy—at least briefly—after heoutstayed his welcome in Switzerland. According to a U.S. intelligence report,Dollmann was expelled from Switzerland in February 1952 after he was caughthaving sex with a Swiss police official. In desperation, Dollmann appealed tohis old fascist friends in the Italian church, and he was spirited across theborder and given temporary sanctuary at a Franciscan monastery in Milan.Dollmann’s savior this time, Father Enrico Zucca, was famous for his role inraising Mussolini’s body from the grave on Easter 1946 in preparation for theday when Il Duce would be reburied with full honors on Rome’s Capitoline Hill.The abbot had less spectacular plans for Dollmann. He slipped a monk’s habit onhim and smuggled him onto a boat in Genoa, from where Dollmann was shipped toGeneral Franco’s fascist paradise in Spain.In Madrid, Dollmann came under the protection of former Nazi commando leaderOtto Skorzeny, who had put together a wide-ranging racket, trading in arms andhelping SS fugitives flee justice. Skorzeny was joined for a time in Spain byHjalmar Schacht, who had been acquitted at Nuremberg and would parlay hisreputation as Hitler’s banker into a postwar career as an internationalfinancial consultant. Schacht knew where much of the wealth plundered fromEurope by German corporations and Nazi officials had been hidden, and Skorzenyused this inside knowledge to help finance his SS ratlines. Angleton also foundSkorzeny’s services useful, and he kept in regular touch with theentrepreneurial ex-Nazi.Dollmann undertook errands for Skorzeny’s international neo-Nazi circuit. ButDollmann was no good at the freelance espionage game. In October 1952, he flewto Germany on some sort of political mission to make contact with German youthgroups. His plans were betrayed and he was arrested at the airport as soon as helanded. The authorities accused him of traveling on a false passport, and hedidn’t bother denying it. Even in his native Germany, Dollmann was a man withouta country. No government wanted to claim him—at least not openly.A November 1952 CIA memo reported that Dollmann was back in Rome. He startedhaunting his favorite cinemas again, but this time it nearly proved fatal when“he was noticed by certain Communist elements” in the theater and had to be“rescued by the police from a threatening mob.”Still desperate for cash in Rome, Dollmann again tried his hand at sellingHitler documents that he insisted were genuine. This time he was dangling anOperation Sunrise angle that Dulles certainly found compelling. Among the papersin his possession, Dollmann swore, was a letter from Hitler to Stalin proposinga separate peace between Germany and Russia. Such a letter would have putDulles’s own Operation Sunrise deal in a much better light. If Hitler and Stalinreally did discuss their own pact near the end of the war, it made Dulles looklike a brilliant chess player instead of an insubordinate troublemaker. Dulles’sfriends at Life magazine let it be known that they would pay a staggering $1million for such a letter. But Dollmann apparently never produced it.Dollmann’s moneymaking schemes grew more frantic. In December 1952, he quietlyreached out to Charles Siragusa, a federal narcotics agent in the U.S. embassyin Rome with close ties to the CIA. Siragusa had proved very useful to Angletonover the years, as a bagman for political payoffs and as a link to the criminalunderworld when the agency required the Mafia’s services. Dollmann had his owninteresting offer for Siragusa. He proposed becoming a paid informant for thenarcotics agent and infiltrating the neo-Nazi movement in Vienna, which heclaimed was financing its activities by dealing cocaine.Dollmann’s offer smacked of desperation, but, in fact, he was already spying onother ex-Nazi colleagues for the CIA. At the same time, in true Dollmannfashion, he was also hiring himself out to these neo-Nazi groups and reportingback to them about U.S. intelligence activities. As if this web of competingloyalties was not complicated enough, while Dollmann was living in Madrid by thegrace of the Franco government, he was also working as a British spy.By 1952, CIA station chiefs in Europe had grown deeply leery of Dollmann. Thatspring, an agency memo circulating among the field stations in Germany, Italy,and Spain warned “against [the operational] use of Dollmann . . . because he hadalready been involved with several intelligence organizations in Western Europesince 1945; his reputation for blackmail, subterfuge and double-dealing isinfamous; [and] he is homosexual.” At one point, CIA officials even raised thepossibility that Dollmann had sold himself to Moscow and was a Soviet doubleagent.But it was not until 1955 that the CIA finally severed its ties to Dollmann. Ittook one last brazen blackmail attempt to persuade Dulles that he had to cut thecord. Dollmann had finished his memoirs that year, and, as promised, the bookwas rife with salacious details, including unflattering observations aboutDulles and Angleton. Before the book went to the printers, Dollmann sent amessage to Dulles through the U.S. consulate in Munich, letting it be known thathe was eager “not to offend [my] great good friend” Dulles, and politely askingthe CIA director to flag anything he found objectionable in the excerpts mailedto him. The implication was clear: They were men of the world who understoodeach other. They could certainly work out an appropriate arrangement.After this, Dollmann abruptly disappeared from the CIA documentary record. Theastute colonel undoubtedly realized that he had pushed his luck with the agencyas far as he should, and, for his own good, it was time to retire from the spygame. He lived on for three more decades, trading on his notorious past to getby. He was a good storyteller, and his two colorful memoirs sold briskly inEurope. His astonishing tales even proved, for the most part, to be true.Dollmann also made frequent appearances on European television, and dabbled abit in his beloved cinematic arts, writing the German subtitles for Fellini’s LaDolce Vita.In 1967, an American writer named Robert Katz, who was working on a book aboutthe Ardeatine Caves massacre, tracked down Dollmann, finding him in thecomfortable residential hotel in Munich where he would live out the rest of hisdays. At sixty-seven, the silver-haired and still trim Dollmann seemed quitecontent with his life. His sunny garret in the blue-painted hotel was clutteredwith photos, books, and memorabilia that recalled his former life. He wasperfectly happy to live in the past, Dollmann told his visitor—after all, he hadbegun his career as a historian, until he was kidnapped by history.At one point, Dollmann brought up Allen Dulles, his old American benefactor.Dulles had recently published The Secret Surrender, his Operation Sunrisememoir, and Dollmann was upset to read the spymaster’s description of him as a“slippery customer.”“From the little English I know,” Dollmann told Katz in his perfect Italian,“‘sleeperee coostomer’ is not exactly a compliment. Is it?”Katz explained that it meant someone who was shrewd, cunning, Machiavellian.The colonel broke into a radiant smile. “Oh! That is a compliment—for me.”"},{"pageContent":"PART II [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-16]"},{"pageContent":"6 [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-17]USEFUL PEOPLE [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-17]Allen Dulles’s wife, Clover, and his wartime mistress, Mary Bancroft, were bothpatients of Carl Jung. Mary began treatment with the man who was the secondpillar of modern psychology in the 1930s, after moving to Zurich with her newhusband, a Swiss banker. Clover entered analysis with Jung after reuniting withAllen in Switzerland in the final months of the war. The extroverted Mary got anelectric charge from her connection to the great man, intellectually sparringwith him, swapping gossip, and, although he was nearly three decades older,openly flirting with him. Clover, whom Jung quickly sized up as a classicintrovert—sensitive, reticent, dreamy—had a more troubled reaction to him, andshe terminated their relationship after a few sessions in favor of one of hisdisciples, a brilliant Jewish female analyst named Jolande Jacobi, who had fledthe Nazi invasion of Vienna. After twenty-five years of marriage to AllenDulles, Clover had had her fill of domineering men. Jung clearly was much morein touch with his female “anima” than her husband. But, still, the imposingfigure struck her as “arrogant” and made her feel small in his presence. Withhis gray mustache, rimless spectacles, and ever-present pipe, Jung even boresome resemblance to her husband.Despite their striking personality differences—and their awkward romantictriangle—Clover and Mary developed a unique friendship that would last the restof their lives. With her keen intuition, Clover sized up the situation soonafter arriving in Bern in January 1945. Finding herself alone with Mary one day,she reportedly told her rival, “I want you to know I can see how much you andAllen care for each other—and I approve.” This story gives Clover an authorityover Allen’s amorous adventures that, in reality, she sorely lacked. In truth,no woman in Dulles’s life enjoyed this type of leverage over him. Even MaryBancroft—who was allowed to participate in some of his secret life as hiswartime courier, translator, confidante, and bedmate—would struggle for years todecipher her relationship with Dulles, which she called “the most complex andoverwhelming” connection of her life.Clover and Mary were bound by their mutual fascination and bewilderment withDulles. But the two women’s joint effort to understand the puzzle that was AllenDulles was a doomed enterprise. On the surface he was full of a charm and gaietythat promised entry into a world of fascinating dignitaries and dazzlingconversation. His air of mystery only seemed to add to his allure. But as thewomen in his life sought more from him, Dulles only revealed a deeper and deeperemotional impenetrability. Even in the life-and-death throes of wartimeespionage, Dulles seemed untouched by the intense human drama swirling aroundhim. Mary would always remember “those cold, blue eyes of his” and “that ratherpeculiar, mirthless laugh.”In her effort to find out more about the man at the emotional center of herlife, Mary sought enlightenment from the great Jung. She made her way down thelong, tree-lined path to his home on Lake Zurich, above whose elaborate stoneportal was etched in Latin: Vocatus atque non vocatus deus aderit (“Called oruncalled, God will be present”). Jung was alive to the potential of thesupernatural. He believed in demons and angels. The inscription reminded Jung,who said he always felt “unsafe,” that he was “in the presence of superiorpossibilities.”Jung enjoyed discussing men of power and action like Dulles. Analyzing thedictators of his era who held the fate of Europe in their hands, he haddeveloped various power “archetypes.” Jung deemed Hitler a “medicine man” whoruled more through magic than political power. Whereas Mussolini projected thebrute strength of a tribal chief, Hitler seemed to lack not just physicalpotency but basic human qualities. His power came from his uncanny “mystical”ability to tap into the German people’s deeply troubled unconscious.Before the war, standing near the two leaders at a Berlin military parade, Jungonce had the occasion to observe Hitler and Mussolini together. Jung recalledthe revealing experience for an interviewer in October 1938. While Mussolinigreeted the goose-stepping troops and trotting cavalry horses “with the zest ofa small boy at the circus,” Hitler showed no emotion. He appeared to Jung like“a mask, like a robot, or a mask of a robot. . . . He seemed as if he might bethe double of a real person, and that Hitler the man might perhaps be hidinginside like an appendix, and deliberately so hiding in order not to disturb themechanism.“What an amazing difference there is between Hitler and Mussolini!” Jungexclaimed. “I couldn’t help liking Mussolini. . . . You have the homely feelingwith Mussolini of being with a human being. With Hitler, you are scared.”Jung’s portrait of Hitler is as chilling a picture of psychopathology as youwill find. Dulles was fascinated by his insights into the German leader, and heurged Mary to keep seeking more such wisdom from Jung.The esteemed psychoanalyst was happy to oblige. The two most powerful men inMary Bancroft’s life were intrigued with each other, though they had littledirect communication. Jung had a hard time figuring out Dulles. He did not fitneatly into the Jungian system of power archetypes. One could see in Dulles thesame disturbing mix of magnetism and ruthlessness that Jung observed in thedictators of his day. But there was also an impenetrable blankness that made himhard to read. Jung warned Mary that her lover was “quite a tough nut.”Dulles, for his part, approved of his wife and mistress’s submitting to Jung’streatment. He told Mary that he realized analysis could be “useful” for others,but he was convinced that he himself had no need for it.Throughout his life, Dulles was drawn to creative, intelligent, neurotic womenlike Clover and Mary—women who were under constant siege from their unconscious,as Joan Dulles described her mother’s emotional plight. For a man as emotionallynumb as Dulles, women like this were his essential link to the rest of humanity.They translated human feeling for him. They were, in short, “useful”—thatfavorite word of his. It was a word, recalled Mary, which “was constantly on hislips.” If Dulles could use a person, that person was somehow real for him. Ifnot, that person didn’t exist.Allen Dulles first laid eyes on Martha Clover Todd in the summer of 1920 at aparty of fashionable young people at a lakeside resort near the Dulles familyhome in upstate New York. Before the week was out, he had proposed to her. Shelater spoke of her blitzkrieg courtship and marriage to Dulles with a sense ofwonder. She couldn’t quite explain why she had agreed to marry the headstrongyoung man. “I married Allen,” she told a curious nephew years later, “because hewas attractive, and doing interesting things.” This commonplace observation wasthe best she could offer. Clover had other suitors at the time, including aperfectly acceptable young doctor who was particularly eager to win her. Thatcourtship became entangled in her indecision. But Allen Dulles gave her no roomto ruminate or reconsider. He had made the decision for both of them—she was thegirl for him.At twenty-six, Clover was a year younger than Dulles, and she radiated anethereal beauty that set her apart from the other debutantes in her social set.She had sensuous lips and wide-set, almond-shaped green eyes that seemed to hintof deep sadness. She spoke in a breathy voice that made men lean closer to her.In photographs of Clover at the time, she always seemed to be looking away fromthe camera, as if her thoughts were somewhere else and too melancholy to beshared. She had an air of fragile mystery that undoubtedly appealed to Dulles.But she also possessed some of the feisty “flapper” spirit of her generation ofliberated women. She looked sexy and self-possessed in the masculine fashions ofthe day, posing for one photo in a trim suit, businesslike tie, and awide-brimmed hat jammed down over her tightly coiffed curls.Once, on holiday from her Connecticut boarding school, Clover was invited by aneccentric New York society queen to an evening in honor of “some poor convicts”recently paroled from Sing Sing prison. The evening was grinding on withexcruciating stiffness until Clover broke the ice by challenging the ex-cons toa game of poker. In later years, she made prison reform a passionate personalcommitment. Clover’s affinity for convicts was fueled by the fact that she oftenfelt like a prisoner of her own life. During World War I, she volunteered as acanteen girl in a Paris officers’ club. She sometimes wandered the streets ofthe war-tattered city dressed as a beggar, just to feel what it was like to besomeone else, someone who had to plead for bread.Clover’s own childhood was rich in material comfort. Her mother came from awealthy Baltimore manufacturing family whose foundry had produced the metalplates for the USS Monitor, the famed ironclad Civil War vessel. Her father,Henry Todd, was a distinguished professor of romance languages at ColumbiaUniversity. She and her sister and two brothers grew up in a tastefullyfurnished house near Central Park filled with books and music. Their fatherwould take his children on long strolls through the city, discoursing at lengthon its history and architecture. Her mother would make “fairy circles” from tinywhite stones in the park, where, she insisted, the sprites would gather fordances on moonlit nights. Clover grew up with her mother’s fey spirit and wouldconstantly be disappointed by the modern world’s banality. Instead of the fairyworld conjured by her mother, she was forced to dwell in a world “toopedestrian, too filled with anxiety, with duty, with the necessity to be alwaysright.”Clover’s father, a strict Presbyterian with an Old Testament sense of right andwrong, made her feel that she never measured up. When she was eight and hersister, Lisa, was ten, he tried to teach them both Latin but gave up infrustrated rage. “We simply weren’t ready for Latin yet, or at least I wasn’t,”she recalled. “We exasperated Father terribly. He was a scholar—very tense andhigh-strung—and he cared. As he was a professor, it was hard to have subnormalchildren.”Her mother, who was prone to debilitating migraines and would often take to bedfor long “rest cures,” was too involved with her own travails to provide herchildren with maternal love. There were nursemaids for the children andhousekeepers, and when Clover’s mother was confined to bed under her pillowywhite bedspread, an efficient domestic manager named Miss MacMillan would arriveand put the house in order. But Clover’s mother would go into rapid decline assoon as Miss MacMillan departed, overwhelmed by the obligations of family life.Clover’s emotional touchstone in her family was her younger brother, Paul, abeautiful and sensitive boy the nursemaids enjoyed dressing like a girl. Whilestill quite young, he began demonstrating precocious artistic skill, drawing“the most astonishing [pictures], queer animals always, each one different fromthe last and exhibiting the most extraordinary amount of skill and imagination.”But their father thought Paul’s nursemaids had turned him into a “sissy.” Heseemed too fragile for the rough-and-tumble of college life when he went away toPrinceton in 1918, and at the end of his freshman year, he dropped out.On the eve of Allen and Clover’s wedding—which was held in October 1920 on thewooded estate of Todd family friends outside Baltimore—Paul sent word that hedid not feel hearty enough to attend the festivities. “He said he didn’t feelwell enough and we thought it rather queer,” Clover later noted in her diary,“but we were always all of us not being well and having all sorts of inhibitionsand neurotic feelings.”Clover later tormented herself for not being more attuned to her brother’semotional condition as she prepared for her wedding. But she herself was in astate of great anxiety. “To me it was a terrible strain being engaged, tryingall the time to act the way you suppose a normal person would act, instead ofsimply jumping out the window the way you naturally would. So I wasn’t thinkingvery much about my brother.” That December, when the newly wed couple arrived inConstantinople, Allen’s next diplomatic port of call, Clover heard that Paul hadsuffered a nervous breakdown and been confined to a fashionable sanitarium inGreenwich, Connecticut. In November 1921, after being discharged, thetwenty-one-year-old was found dead in bushes alongside a road not far from thesanitarium. He had shot himself between the eyes with a revolver.Paul’s death plagued Clover for many years. “In a certain sense I suppose I didkill [Paul], at least I let him die, yes, certainly I let him die withoutlifting a finger,” she wrote nearly three decades later in a therapeutic journalshe was keeping.Clover quickly learned that the man she married was simply not suited to helpsomeone with as much inner turmoil as she suffered. She was tortured by feelingsof worthlessness, which Allen did little to allay. Throughout most of theirearly married life, Clover underwent Freudian analysis with variouspsychoanalysts in New York, and at one point she committed herself to asanitarium for six weeks. “I started Freudian analysis,” she wrote in a journalmany years later, “because I was suffering so much that it was not possible tolive unless I did.”Clover and Allen’s oldest daughter, Martha (“Toddie”), also grappled withpsychic demons throughout her life—bouts of manic depression that became sosevere that she submitted to multiple rounds of electroshock therapy. In someways, Toddie was the most like her father—energetically outgoing andself-confident. But his daughter’s troubles failed to engage Dulles. Nor did hedisplay much interest in his children’s accomplishments, including those of hisson and namesake, Allen Jr., even when the boy began to shine at Exeter, wherethe headmaster said he was the brightest student in the school.Dulles seemed a guest in his own family home—amiable but detached. It was clearto his daughter Joan that “his life was somewhere else.”“My father was a benign figure at home,” she remembered. “He was friendly, buthe was clearly not interested in us. . . . I don’t remember any anger. He neverscolded us when we weren’t doing well enough in school, or asked us how we weredoing.”The one time Joan saw her father cry was after he heard on the radio about thefall of France to Hitler’s troops. She watched this rare display of emotion with“astonishment” as her father wept in his library. But she had no idea why thisdramatic bulletin—among everything else in his eventful life—had so profound aneffect on him. He never discussed politics or world events at home, even thoughit was the fuel of his career. “At breakfast he would have the New York Timesand I wouldn’t be able to tell you anything about his attitude toward anything.He’d be buried in the newspaper.”There’s a “price,” Joan added, for this sort of emotional anesthesia in afamily, for never “talking in the home about your life and your politics andwhat’s going on”—about anything that truly matters. “I think it’s devastating.”Dulles carefully insulated Clover from his life. He would fly off to distantlocations at a moment’s notice and not tell her where he was going or for howlong. It had nothing to do with intelligence protocol, insisted Joan. “It wasjust the way he operated.”Mary felt that Dulles kept his professional life from Clover because he wasafraid that she was too morally sensitive and would disapprove of his undercoverwork. But he seldom showed much of a protective instinct toward his wife. Dulleswould fill his letters home to Clover with references to his many dalliances andinfatuations with other women. The life he evoked in this correspondence wasfilled with beautiful countesses and expertly mixed cocktails, and was certainonly to cruelly reinforce Clover’s domestic confinement.Eleanor Dulles once remarked on the difference between her two brothers. Foster,who was inseparable from his own wife, Janet, would go out of his way to helpanyone in the family who was in distress. The pious older brother would evensecure an abortionist—in his day, not an easy or legal task—if it came to that,she said. “As for Allen,” added Eleanor, “when anyone was in trouble, Allenseemed always to be off somewhere, lying under a palm, getting himself fanned.”Clover tried to keep the distress of her marriage from her children. Despite herhusband’s frequent absences—and his constant social demands when he was home—sheran the family households in Manhattan and Long Island with calm efficiency. Shetook pains to compensate for his emotional shortcomings. In a letter she wroteJoan in February 1945, soon after reuniting with Allen in Bern, she tried to puthis extreme self-absorption in the best possible light for their daughter. Bythen, Dulles had been away from home for over two years, during which time hehad no contact with his children as they navigated their way throughadolescence.“Dad asked for news of you both very especially—[you] and Allen—and your comingof age,” Clover wrote. “Otherwise it would not be possible for you to imaginehow engrossed he is in his work, and how he neither thinks, speaks or asks ofanything else. There is no doubt he is different from most but I do believe thathe does everything that he does, not only because he likes it, but as a way ofshowing his affection for us, paying us the compliment of believing that what wewant is for him to do something worthwhile in the world. Everyone here adoreshim and he has done incalculable good.”But many years later, Clover would write a more honest assessment of her husbandin a diary that she left for her children. By then, she felt no obligation towindow-dress their marriage. “My husband doesn’t converse with me, not that hedoesn’t talk to me about his business, but that he doesn’t talk about anything.. . . It took me a long time to realize that when he talks it is only for thepurpose of obtaining something. . . . He talks easily with men who can give himsome information, and puts himself out with women whom he doesn’t know to tellall sorts of interesting things. He has either to be making someone admire him,or to be receiving some information worth his while; otherwise he gives one theimpression that he doesn’t talk because the person isn’t worth talking to.”It was Clover’s curse to spend her life with such a man, and it was Allen’s tolive with a woman who was finally able to understand him.Near the end of the war, Clover went to great lengths to rejoin Allen inSwitzerland, pulling every available string to acquire the visas and travelpermits necessary for an American citizen to venture into war-torn Europe. Atlast, after hearing that the U.S. embassy in newly liberated Paris had ordered ashipment of official cars, she finagled an assignment as one of the drivers.After a rough ocean crossing, Clover disembarked in Lisbon and joined the convoyas it took an arduous course through Portugal and Spanish Basque country,crossing the Pyrenees into France, where she and the other dozen drivers cameunder the protection of French resistance fighters. It took a full week for thedrivers to complete their painstaking journey to Paris. When the exhaustedClover delivered her vehicle to the American embassy, she was relieved to hearthat her husband was also in Paris—but he installed her at a different hotel andkept her waiting for two full days before finally greeting her.When he appeared in her hotel room, Dulles brusquely informed her that he couldspare only ten minutes. He told her to meet him early the next morning at hisown hotel to begin their automobile journey to Switzerland. Then, without makingany effort to cushion the blow, he announced that her mother had died whileClover was crossing the Atlantic. And with that, he disappeared again, leavingher to mourn alone.“My wife is an angel,” Dulles told Mary soon after meeting her. “She’s alwaysdoing things for other people.” But that is not the way Allen generally madeClover feel. After Clover began treatment with Jolande Jacobi, the analystencouraged her artistically inclined patient to begin expressing her innerturmoil in drawings. In one picture, Clover drew herself as a crying, forlorndonkey. That’s the way she felt, she explained to Mary—like a weepy ass—wheneverAllen was rushing around, “engaged in activities [Clover] didn’t understand butsuspected were not as important as his behavior implied.”When Dulles shifted his operations to Germany in the postwar period, Clovermoved to Zurich so that she could work more closely with Jacobi. It was anintense, therapeutic relationship that Clover kept going long after she returnedto the United States, returning to Switzerland on numerous occasions forprolonged visits. While visiting the United States, Jacobi would stay at theDulles home in Washington. What Jacobi did for her suffering patient “wasnothing short of a miracle,” Clover later wrote. After each of her Swisssessions, Clover would hurry to a Zurich café to jot down the insights she hadunearthed with Jacobi. The treatment, she wrote at the time, filled her with anew self-confidence. Clover began to feel “liberated from the feeling that myhusband’s way of looking at things is the right way or has any particularglamour or reason attached to it.”The journals that Clover kept during her analysis are mercilesslyintrospective—wrenching cries from the darkest depths of her soul. Some of thejournals were devoted to meticulous accounts of her dreams, which revealed themisery of her marriage as well as a vibrant but stifled erotic imagination. Inone dream, which she recorded in her journal in November 1945, Clover wassuffering from a terrible physical trauma, but Allen was completely oblivious toher pain. “My whole stomach had collapsed, or been cut open or cut in two. . . .[But] it was a great satisfaction, a sort of triumph even, a justification tomyself that all the time there actually had been something seriously the matterwith me, a proof that instead of making a big fuss about nothing, as my husbandthought, I actually had made comparatively little out of a really bigaffliction.”In other dreams, Clover expressed shame about her husband’s mysterious espionageexploits. She entered nameless towns where “men were taking part in dark andnefarious negotiations.” In her dreams, as in life, she was excluded from thesesecret activities, which carried a tawdry air, but nonetheless sometimes held apowerful allure for her. Clover also gave vent to her sexual jealousy. In adream fragment from September 1948, her husband complains that he has no freshunderwear. But when Clover peers into his dresser drawer, she finds it stuffedwith undershorts. On closer inspection, however, each pair is stained withsemen.Other dreams overflow with her own libidinal energy and confusion. She findsherself in bed with young soldiers and naked women, an architect she knew, andin more than one reverie her disrobed sister. In a dream of October 1945, Cloverwas engaged to be married to a woman—who turned out to be Mary Bancroft. She wasdelighted to be marrying a woman but was horrified that “I didn’t have thephysical apparatus to play a masculine role. I felt very shaven and shorthandempty in front and very much concerned how I could marry. Then I realized that,after all, she knew I was a woman, she was a woman herself, it wasn’t even myfault I was made that way. And as a matter of fact, what ever made me feel thatI was supposed to be the man? Why wasn’t she the man? Perhaps she didn’t evenexpect me to be the man.”It was her severe, judgmental father—a man repelled by “the inferiority” of thefemale sex—who had bestowed on her “my disgust of women,” Clover noted inanother journal entry. “I want a penis,” she stated in another.In other journal entries, which she called her “hymns of hate,” Clover expelledpoisonous clouds of the rage and self-loathing that were billowing inside her.She fantasized about going on killing sprees with an ax or sledgehammer, andwhen those weapons proved too limited, she mused about poison gas. She unspooledlong lists of potential victims, but she devoted one entire murder fantasy inMarch 1947 to her husband. “I hate my husband,” it began. “I hate my husband, Ihate my husband. Oh, how I hate my husband . . . I want to kill him . . . I willbe like a fighting cock with knives on my talons, I will cut him in ribbons withsharp knives, I will cut him in the back, I will even perhaps cut his throatwith a sharp sharp knife tied to my talons when I am a bloody murderous fightingcock.”Mary Bancroft sympathized with Clover, up to a point, as they compared notesabout Dulles. By the time Clover arrived in Switzerland, Mary’s own affair withDulles was waning and she brought a more detached perspective to theirdiscussions. Sometimes they could even share a laugh about the enigmatic man whooccupied the center of both of their lives. Clover told Mary that she had onceheard the Dulles brothers referred to as sharks. “And I do think they are,” saidthe wife to the mistress. “I guess there’s no solution but for you and me to bekiller whales!” From then on, the two women referred to Allen as “The Shark” andto themselves as the “Killer Whales.”But Mary was more fascinated with the world of male power than Clover, and sheprided herself on understanding men like Dulles in a way that his wife couldnot. In a later generation, Bancroft herself might have been a central player inthat world. But she settled for taking an occasional place in the room, offeringthese men of action her insight and solace.Mary, whose mother died hours after giving birth to her, was raised by hergrandparents in a comfortable Cambridge, Massachusetts, household dominated bymen whose ambitions always seemed just beyond their reach. Her grandfather was aformer mayor of Cambridge and Harvard overseer who was once talked about as acandidate for governor but never made it beyond municipal politics. Her fatherhad been a precocious young scholar, entering Harvard at the age of fourteen andgraduating summa cum laude three years later. He became a lawyer and, like hisfather, a pillar of civic affairs, winning appointment as the director of thePort of Boston. But the top rung of power eluded Mary’s father, too, and,overcome by the disappointments of his life, he committed suicide in middle age.The man who made the biggest impression on young Mary was a step or two awayfrom her immediate family, Clarence W. Barron, the short, white-bearded,twinkly-eyed publisher of The Wall Street Journal and the stepfather of herstepmother. She spent as much time as she could in “CW’s” lively vortex,watching him dictate memos from bed until noon and sending the male secretarieswho were always at hand scurrying to and fro. At an early age, Mary becamefamiliar with names like Rockefeller, Morgan, Carnegie, Harriman, Ford, and DuPont. Their world always seemed to hover tantalizingly just beyond herfingertips.Mary was disappointed in marriage. Her first husband—the father of her twochildren—turned out to be a dull company man. Her second—a French-Swiss bankerwho traveled frequently on business to the Balkans and the Far East—promised tobe more exotic. But once she was installed in his Zurich home, they settled intoa marriage of convenience that left Mary ready for more adventure.When Mary was introduced to Dulles in December 1942, shortly after he arrived inSwitzerland, they instantly took to each other. At thirty-nine, she was a decadeyounger than the OSS man, and by her own account she was “at the height of mysexual prowess and usually always on the prowl.”Mary was a big-boned woman with round cheeks and a ready smile that was allteeth. Nor was Allen the stuff of romantic dreams. Her first impression of himwas of an aging man with “iron-gray hair” and the rumpled clothes of adistracted professor. But Mary not only possessed the right pedigree, she had asharp intelligence and an accommodating warmth, and Dulles instantly knew hecould put her to use. Mary, in turn, found herself immediately excited by theaura of power that seemed to surround Dulles. “He actually shimmered with it,”she later wrote in a journal. “It seemed to cling to him as phosphorescence doesto the oars when one is rowing a boat at night.”Here was the man who would finally take her into the world of action about whichshe had fantasized ever since she was a girl, when she watched Wild Bill Donovanparade down Fifth Avenue with his troops on Armistice Day. Ever since then, shewrote, “I longed for a life of adventure. I wanted to go everywhere, seeeverything.” She even daydreamed about being a “glamorous spy” like Mata Hari.Now she had found the man to make her dreams come true.Dulles never made Bancroft an official OSS agent, but he quickly found a rolefor her, phoning her at her Zurich apartment every morning at nine thirty andgiving her the day’s marching orders. She pumped information out of a variety ofsources for him—from cleaning maids with German relatives to members of theintellectual and artistic elite in the German-Austrian exile community, a crowdwith whom the well-read and over-analyzed Bancroft was more comfortable thanDulles.Mary also proved that she was more tuned in to certain nuances of the spy craftthan Dulles. She realized, for instance, that intelligence could be gatheredfrom the enemy as well as Allied camps by tapping into the undergroundhomosexual network that ran through Europe’s diplomatic and espionage circles.“One of my [OSS] colleagues was frantic,” Bancroft later recalled, “because hewanted to get a—how do the French say it, a tuyaux—you know, a line into thishomosexual network. And he used to bang on the desk and say, ‘I wish Washingtonwould send me a reliable fairy! I want somebody with a pretty behind so I canget into that fairy network and find out what the British are doing in NorthAfrica!’” Her colleague couldn’t bring himself to discuss his delicaterecruitment needs with the old-fashioned Dulles, who—as Mary repeatedly observedin her journals—had been born in the nineteenth century. So Mary broached thesubject with Dulles, who did indeed prove clueless about the homosexual beaumonde, including its sexual mechanics. “What do those people actually do?” heasked Mary.Although Dulles and Jung met face-to-face in early 1943, Mary also continued toserve as the main link between the two commanding men in her life. Both men wereexcited by the idea of forging a pioneering marriage between espionage andpsychology. Dulles’s reports back to Washington were filled with Jung’s insightsinto the Nazi leadership and the German people. Jung even correctly predictedthat an increasingly desperate Hitler would likely commit suicide. Mary’sappointments with Jung became dominated by Dulles’s “ask Jung” questions, to thepoint that they more closely resembled espionage briefings than therapysessions.Dulles was so enamored with the flow of provocative psycho-political perceptionsfrom Jung that he gave the psychologist an OSS number—Agent 488. After the war,the spymaster hinted broadly to a Jung family friend that the sage of Zurich hadeven contributed to the Allied cause by leaking information he had gleaned fromsessions with patients who were connected to the enemy side. But this might havebeen an exaggeration from a spy chief who liked to pride himself on all theinfluential personalities he had in his pocket.While Dulles valued Mary as a go-between with men like Jung, he also found morepersonal uses for her. One morning he came rushing into her apartment when heknew that her husband was away on business. “Quick!” he barked, dispensing withany foreplay. “I’ve got a very tricky meeting coming up. I want to clear myhead.” When he had finished with her, Dulles quickly headed for the door.“Thanks,” he said over his shoulder. “That’s just what I needed!”Afterward, Mary resolved to tell Dulles that she would no longer cooperate in“clearing his head,” no matter how stressful his upcoming meetings were. But shecontinued to make herself available to him.The spy chief was confident enough in his control over Mary that he felt hecould loan her out to a German Abwehr agent with whom Dulles had established arelationship. Dulles arranged for Mary, who was fluent in German, to work withthe tall, imperious Nazi double agent Hans Bernd Gisevius on his memoirs.Gisevius had secretly turned against Hitler after his once promising Gestapocareer had stalled, and in frustration he began feeding Dulles important insideinformation on German military operations. One day, Gisevius, who had grownenamored of Mary as they toiled together over his manuscript, begged her to comewith him to Lugano, where he would have use of a “beautiful apartment” and wherehe would be meeting with the first chief of the Gestapo, Rudolf Diels. Theinvitation appealed to Mary’s appetite for danger, but she turned it down. Whenshe told Dulles about it, he was upset, not because he had a rival for hismistress’s affections, but because she had missed an opportunity to squeeze moreinformation out of the amorous German. “Why the hell didn’t you go?” he snappedat her. “It might have been very interesting.”Mary did, in fact, later become Gisevius’s lover. But, as she confided to Jung,shuttling back and forth between the two men proved to be emotionally draining.Gisevius became one of the principal conspirators in the July 20, 1944, bombplot against Hitler, barely fleeing with his life to Switzerland after itfailed. When she discussed her German lover’s exploits with Jung, he wasunimpressed with Gisevius’s moral character. The Abwehr man was fighting for thesame thing that Hitler possessed, Jung told Mary: “pure power.” He added thatGisevius and his rival in the conspiracy ring, General Claus von Stauffenberg,“were like a pair of lions fighting over a hunk of raw meat.” When she gave Jungsome pages from Gisevius’s book for his reaction, he pronounced them “saturatedwith Nazi ideology.”Jung told Mary that she would always attract “extremely ambitious men interestedin gaining power for themselves.” She would never be the type of woman whojudged men like this, whatever their moral flaws. “Power was my naturalelement,” she later reflected. “I felt as at home in situations of power as afish did in water.”Dulles would gain notoriety for his promiscuity—at least among his biographers,some of whom expressed greater disdain for his sexual indiscretions than for hismore egregious moral failings. But by Mary’s standards, he was by no meanssexually reckless. She took umbrage when British traitor Kim Philby describedDulles as a “womanizer” in his memoir. “Kim Philby of all people!” sheharrumphed. “[Allen] was nothing of the kind.”One evening, while warming themselves by the fireplace at Herrengasse, Mary fellinto conversation with Dulles about Napoleon’s love life. She told him that shehad read that the great conqueror had enjoyed nine women during his life.“Nine!” exclaimed Dulles. “I beat him by one!” Mary was amused by Allen’s boast.“To anyone born in the 20th century as I was,” she later noted in her journal,“that seemed a very modest score, particularly for a man who had traveled theworld as Allen had. It certainly did not qualify him as a womanizer in my book.”Dulles was fortunate to find someone like Mary, a woman whose morals wereconveniently flexible—or, as she herself put it, a woman with a “sophisticatedpoint of view.” She had a curious way of explaining her moral dexterity, butDulles certainly would have endorsed her way of thinking. “In order to engage inintelligence work successfully,” Mary observed, “it was essential to have a veryclear-cut idea of your own moral values, so that if you were forced by necessityto break them, you were fully conscious of what you were doing and why.”But even the sophisticated Mary found herself unnerved by one of herconversations with Dulles. She had observed that despite his cunning reputation,Allen always seemed so “open and trusting,” even with people about whom heclearly harbored suspicions or whom he “actually had the goods on.” As helistened to Mary, Dulles grinned. “I like to watch the little mice sniffing atthe cheese just before they venture into the little trap,” he told her. “I liketo see their expressions when it snaps shut, breaking their little necks.”Mary was taken aback by this outburst. She told him she found it repellent, butDulles would have none of her outrage. “What’s the matter with you?” he said.“Don’t you realize that if I had not caught them, they were about to catch me?”It did not occur to Mary to ask why “little mice” could be so threatening, orhow he could take such pleasure from their suffering.Clover Dulles had great hopes for her second daughter, Joan, after she graduatedfrom Radcliffe College in 1944, where many of her classes had been integratedwith Harvard’s due to the wartime shortage of professors. Clover wanted herdaughter to escape the confinements of domestic life by pursuing a life ofadventure. After graduating, Joan joined the Frontier Nursing Service, anorganization that imported British midwives—because midwifery was outlawed inAmerica—to help deliver babies in the back hills of Kentucky. Joan escorted themidwives on horseback through the remote hills and hollows of the BluegrassState, sometimes riding for as long as five hours to reach their destinations.The young woman was enchanted by the beauty of the Kentucky backcountry and wasthrilled by the rugged work.In April of the following year, as the war was coming to an end, Joan sailed forEurope with her aunt Eleanor, who was on a diplomatic assignment to Austria, acountry that was rapidly turning into a front line in the Cold War. Vienna,which was divided into Allied occupational zones, was suffused with the dangerand intrigue later displayed in the 1949 film The Third Man. Joan was oncethreatened with arrest by Russian soldiers as she traveled by train through theSoviet zone. Government officials in the Western zones often disappeared off thestreets, snatched by Soviet agents.Not much more than a year out of college, Joan seemed well on her way tofulfilling her mother’s hopes of creating a bold life for herself. She hadstudied international law and relations at Radcliffe, and she seemed wellpositioned to follow her aunt’s pioneering path as a female diplomat, or evenher father’s as a legendary spy. She could speak French and German and waslearning Russian, a language that she particularly loved, finding it “just likemusic.”But Allen Dulles had other plans for his daughter.While Joan was living in Vienna, her father introduced her to one of his youngagents from the war, a well-born and well-connected Austrian named Fritz Molden.The son of a prominent newspaper editor and a widely respected author and poet,Molden and his family had suffered cruelly at the hands of the Gestapo duringthe war. After escaping from a Wehrmacht punishment battalion on the easternfront that he had been forced to join, Molden took up with the Austrianresistance, where he was put in touch with Dulles. Molden grew attached toDulles, though the spymaster kept asking the young man to “prove himself” byrisking his life for him. After the war, the Communists accused Molden ofcontinuing to work as a paid agent for Dulles, but he denied it.When Joan and Fritz married in spring 1948, it was clearly a marriage ofconvenience—for Joan’s father and her new husband. Molden, who became secretaryto Austrian foreign minister Karl Gruber after the war and later an influentialjournalist and diplomat, was a vital intelligence connection for Dulles. Themarriage was also a wise move for Molden. For the young, ambitious Austrian,having Allen Dulles as a father-in-law was obviously a big feather in his cap.But the match proved much less successful for Joan.Just like her mother many years before, Joan had great difficulty explaining whyshe had married her husband. Joan suffered the same severe pre-wedding doubtsthat Clover had before marrying Allen. Joan found Fritz a “very erraticcharacter, always given to creating dramatic situations,” as she later wrote hermother. She worried about marrying “someone who wasn’t ever satisfied with thesimple everyday aspects of life.” But, in the end, Joan gave in to theimplacable intensity of her suitor and went through with the marriage, resigningherself to the fact that she would never have children or enjoy a stable familylife with such a man.Her marriage to Molden, who openly reveled in the company of other women, soondeveloped a striking resemblance to that of her parents. He often disappeared onmysterious rendezvous, leaving her to wonder when she would see him again.“Fritz was a ladies’ man, that’s for sure,” Joan recalled years later. “He wasso extroverted that you just never knew where he was. He’d say, ‘Let’s rent asailing ship in the Greek islands,’ and I didn’t know how many of hisgirlfriends would be on board or for how long we’d be at sea. Do I seesimilarities with my father? Probably, probably.”Joan divorced Molden in 1954, but, as if to not disappoint her father, shequickly replaced him with another high-ranking Austrian diplomat named EugenBuresch. The son of a former Austrian chancellor, Buresch had succeeded Moldenas director of the Austrian Information Service in New York. The following year,after being named Austria’s ambassador to Iran, Buresch took Joan off to Tehran,another highly sensitive diplomatic posting. Joan suddenly found herself amidthe imperial splendor of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi’s court, the emperorreinstalled on the Peacock Throne by her father, after the CIA overthrew Iran’sdemocratically elected government in 1953.Joan gave birth to two children with Buresch, a boy and girl. Like Fritz Molden,Joan’s second choice for a husband seemed crafted primarily for her father’sprofessional benefit. Iran was not only an oil-rich nation, it was astrategically located CIA surveillance platform bordering the Soviet Union. Tohave a son-in-law acting as his eyes and ears inside the shah’s court was anespionage boon for Dulles, who by then was running the CIA.But, again, the marriage turned out to be much less beneficial for Joan. In July1959, Joan wrote her father a painful letter, made all the more poignant by itsresolutely upbeat tone, informing him that she and Buresch had separated. Joan,who was living with her young children in Switzerland at the time, had recentlyvisited her parents in Washington but found it easier to tell her father aboutthe failure of her second marriage through the post. The separation had not beenher idea, she assured her father—she “would have gone on trying endlessly forthe sake of the children,’’ she wrote. But, in any case, she was “very glad tobe alone again.”Joan had good reason to welcome the breakup. Buresch, it turned out, had aviolent streak. “Every six months, or every time I do something he doesn’tapprove of,” she wrote her father, “he gets terrible fits of rage and tries tobeat me up, etc. etc. Last summer, because I tried to come to Europe to seemother, he nearly kicked me out.” When she said, “kicked me out,” Joan added,she meant it “literally.” Apparently Buresch vented his fury with his feet aswell as his fists.Joan did not dwell on the abuse that “Gino,” as she called her husband, metedout. She was much more concerned that her father not worry about her, or worse,write her off as a hopeless case after the collapse of her second marriage. “Pa,you will think indeed that you have a black sheep in me, but I am glad to befree, I shall live alone and bring up my children, mind my own business and I amsure I will be happy.”Joan was clearly eager for her father’s reassurance, even his forgiveness. “Pa,”she continued, “I have never been scared of life and I am not now. I like beingalive no matter what comes. I hope you know what I mean, and that you will notbe either too angry or too upset.”Joan finally found sanctuary, not only from her husband but from her father, bymoving with her children to the remote New Mexico high desert. It was about asfar as possible from her father’s world of power as she could venture. She madeher home in Santa Fe, among artists and free spirits, returning to Zurich in themid-1960s to study at the C. G. Jung Institute, where she became a certifiedpsychoanalyst. After coming back home to Santa Fe, she married a prominentJungian therapist named John Talley, with whom she lived and worked until hisdeath in 2013.Mary Bancroft believed that she had fallen in love with Allen Dulles. Among themany men in her life, she had only given her heart to two, and he was one. ButDulles himself was incapable of returning love. Jung told her this, in so manywords. One day, while sitting in his study—a room stuffed with books, busts ofVoltaire and Nietzsche, and primitive artifacts—Jung made an observation thatstuck with Mary for many years. The opposite of love is not hate, he said. It’spower. Relationships fueled by a drive for power, where one person seeksdominance over the other, are incapable of producing love.Mary remained enthralled by the Dulles mystique all her life. But through yearsof agonizing self-exploration, Clover and Joan finally arrived at somethingclose to the truth. As Jung observed, “One does not become enlightened byimagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious.”In the end, this is what Dulles’s wife and daughter came to understand about theman who dominated so much of their lives. The drive for absolute control was theonly passion that truly gripped Allen Dulles."},{"pageContent":"7 [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-19]LITTLE MICE [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-19]On a sweltering morning in August 1950, a slim, blond, attractivetwenty-eight-year-old woman named Erica Glaser Wallach woke from a restlesssleep in her West Berlin hotel room, locked her papers and most of her money inthe cupboard, and walked east through the Brandenburg Gate to her doom. Theyoung German-born woman left behind her husband, a former U.S. Army captainnamed Robert Wallach who was studying at the Sorbonne in Paris, and their twoinfant children. She was weak with fear as she entered the headquarters of theSED, the East German Communist Party. But she was determined to go through withher mission.A year before, Erica Wallach’s adoptive father, a hopelessly idealistic AmericanQuaker relief worker named Noel Field, had disappeared after being lured toPrague with the promise of a university teaching position. When his equallywide-eyed wife, Herta, and younger brother, Hermann, went looking for Noelbehind the Iron Curtain, they, too, vanished. Despite the obvious risk, Wallachwas now determined to find out what had happened to the Fields, a family thathad rescued her during the war when she was a seventeen-year-old refugee fromNazi Germany and Franco’s Spain. Noel and Herta Field had whisked a sick andstarving Erica and her ailing mother from a squalid French refugee camp, andlater agreed to care for the teenage girl in Switzerland during the war when herparents fled to England. Wallach now felt honor-bound to track down the missingFields, using her connections with German Communists whom she had met during thewar.When Wallach asked to see her old war comrades at the SED headquarters, she wastold they were not available. She would later find out why: they were in prison,and Erica Wallach would soon join them. On her way out of the gloomy SEDfortress, a hand suddenly gripped her shoulder. “Criminal police. Please comearound the corner.” She didn’t even bother to turn around. “I knew that all waslost.”For the next five years, Wallach would suffer harsh imprisonment, first inBerlin’s Schumannstrasse Prison, which she christened her “house of horrors,”and then, for the longest stretch, in Vorkuta, the dread prison labor complex inRussia’s Arctic wastelands a thousand miles northeast of Moscow. Wallach, thecultured daughter of a physician, learned to survive the gulag by giving up allhope that she would ever return to her family and the lost joys and comforts ofher old life. She would rise early each morning in the dark with her labor gangand work as hard as she could to avoid freezing in the ferociously coldtemperatures, shoveling gravel six days a week—and often seven—for new railroadembankments.“This business of nothing to look at, the ugliness, the lack of color, the lackof good smell—that really is worse than the hunger,” Wallach later recalled.“But you get used to it. I finally after three years got used to the fact that Iwas totally alone in this world.”Wallach learned to ingratiate herself with her fellow prisoners—Russian,Ukrainian, German, and Polish women, and even one American who had found smalland less small ways of offending the Soviet state. She became a different personthan the naïve woman who had walked through Brandenburg Gate that morning inAugust 1950. She even looked like someone else—muscled and thick and callusedfrom her labors. The young woman made a grim new life for herself there “at theend of the earth” among the drunken, homesick Soviet guards and her fellow penalcolony inmates. She found ways to break up the barren monotony of her days bylistening to the Ukrainians’ melancholy folk songs and attending the Sunday“salons” hosted by the educated women whose latrine-cleaning duties were thefoulest of all prison jobs, but gave them enough leisure to indulge theirintellectual curiosity.In the end, the hardened Wallach decided that surviving a frozen hell likeVorkuta was a matter of mental adjustment. “Horror, fear, mental torture,” shewould later write, “are not physical facts but creations of one’s own spirit.They were not forced upon me by outside acts or conditions, but lived within me,born of the weakness of my own heart. . . . I did not have to break if I did notwant to.”While Wallach was enduring Vorkuta, the Fields were suffering their ownnightmares behind the Iron Curtain. After Noel Field was arrested by Czechauthorities in May 1949, he was drugged and driven to a secret location inHungary. There he was dropped down a coal chute and subjected to a variety oftortures, including beatings, sleep deprivation, and round-the-clockinterrogations.Noel’s brother Hermann Field, who was an architecture professor, suffered lessvicious treatment after he was grabbed by Polish secret police three monthslater in Warsaw while searching for his brother. But he spent the first severalmonths of his five-year incarceration in solitary confinement, which woreterribly on his spirit. When a field mouse suddenly appeared in his cell,Hermann was beside himself with joy. The mere brush of the mouse’s fur againstHermann’s leg was the source of enormous comfort. One night, while sleeping, heaccidentally crushed the mouse, which had crawled under his mattress. Hermannwas so grief-stricken that he feared he would lose his mind. “A person living anormal life simply cannot comprehend how sharply such apparently trivialhappenings affect a human being deprived of all living contact and driven to thevery edge of loneliness,” he later observed.During the harsh interrogations to which all four members of the Field familywere subjected, including Erica Wallach, one name kept coming up. “How do youknow Allen Dulles?” the inquisitors repeatedly asked. The spymaster was the onethread that seemed to connect all four of the deeply unfortunate prisoners asthey languished in their cells.By the time Noel Field was taken prisoner in Czechoslovakia in 1949, it had beennearly four years since Allen Dulles occupied an official position with U.S.intelligence. After the war, Dulles had returned to the fold at Sullivan andCromwell, a business routine he now found quite dreary. “I must admit that thesedays I find it hard to concentrate on my profession of the law,” Dullesconfessed to a friend. “Most of my time is spent reliving those exciting dayswhen the war was slowly dying.”A steady stream of former OSS colleagues came to pay their respects at Dulles’sWall Street office, chatting about the war while “the Old Man,” as he wasalready affectionately known in spy circles, though he was only fifty-two,puffed genially on his pipe. But these conversations were not simply fondexercises in nostalgia. The men who called on Dulles—OSS veterans like RichardHelms, Frank Wisner, Tracy Barnes, and Kermit “Kim” Roosevelt—all shared the OldMan’s view that the blissful reign of postwar peace would be short-lived andthat the West must quickly gird itself to confront the growing threat from theEast.That threat was not simply a convenient creation of “Western imperialism.”Stalin’s military machine might have been no match for America’s global reachand nuclear firepower. But it was quite capable of crushing democraticaspirations in Eastern Europe, which the Soviets, following the devastation ofWorld War II, felt they were entitled to controlling as a buffer zone fromWestern aggression. American intelligence officials like Frank Wisner, who hadbeen stationed in Romania near the end of the war and had witnessed thebeginnings of the Soviet-dominated police state there, deeply empathized withthe liberation struggles of the peoples in the Eastern bloc.As they chatted in Dulles’s law suite and gathered for drinks at WilliamDonovan’s town house on Sutton Place, this rarefied group of OSS veterans—whostraddled the worlds of espionage, foreign affairs, and finance—were alreadyplotting to create a powerful intelligence apparatus for the coming Cold War.Spurned by Harry Truman, Donovan began to feel that his own hopes for a returnto postwar action would never be realized. “Our war is over, Allen,” he toldDulles one day. But Dulles would have none of it. The man’s irrepressible egoand ambition never ceased to amaze Donovan.In truth, while Dulles punctually showed up for work at Sullivan and Cromwelleach morning, he never retired from the intelligence game. No sooner had heresumed his life in New York than he began taking a leadership role inprestigious organizations and placing himself at the center of postwar politicaldebates. At the end of 1945, Dulles was elected president of the Council onForeign Relations, a group whose membership of prominent businessmen and policymakers played a key role in shaping the emerging Cold War consensus. Dulleswould huddle with his colleagues in a soundproof room at the council’sheadquarters on the Upper East Side as if he were already running the robust newspy agency that he envisioned.Dulles’s stubborn insistence on staying in the middle of the postwar action paidoff. In April 1947, he was asked by the Senate Armed Services Committee topresent his ideas for a strong, centralized intelligence agency. His memo wouldhelp frame the legislation that gave birth to the CIA later that year.Despite his controversial ties to Nazi Germany, John Foster Dulles had alsomanaged to keep a foot in the political arena, putting himself forward as one ofthe Republican Party’s leading wise men on foreign affairs. Both Dulles brotherspinned their political hopes on New York governor Thomas E. Dewey, the GOPfront-runner for the 1948 presidential nomination. Dewey, a former Wall Streetlawyer with an impressive political résumé, was the Eastern establishment’sclear pick for the White House that year. Political prognosticatorsoverwhelmingly predicted that Dewey would easily outclass President Harry S.Truman—a political hack from Missouri whom many New Deal loyalists consideredunfit to carry on the Roosevelt mission and who, in fact, was facing a challengeon the left from independent candidate Henry Wallace, FDR’s onetime vicepresident and secretary of agriculture. Dewey, already picking out his drapesfor the White House, let it be known that Foster would be his secretary of stateand Allen would take charge of the new intelligence agency that he had helpedcreate.It was Allen who had the tougher views on foreign policy at this stage of thebrothers’ collaboration. As Foster started to flesh out his ideas for the Deweycampaign, he showed his brother a draft of his thoughts on the Soviet threat, inwhich he suggested that the United States and Russia might somehow find a mutual“accommodation.” Allen promptly dismissed such soft thinking. “The differencebetween us,” Allen told Foster, is that “you hold out the hope of somesatisfactory accommodation being possible between the Soviet system . . . andthe rest of the democratic world. I doubt this.” Foster would eventually fall instep with his younger brother’s hard Cold War line.Harry Truman had inherited Franklin Roosevelt’s antipathy toward the Dullesbrothers and their circle. The Dulleses’ close connections to the Dewey camp didnothing to soften Truman’s sentiments. He would dismissively refer to Foster as“that Wall Street fella” or, more bluntly, as “that bastard.” Truman was equallysuspicious of Allen, who kept pushing the administration to take full advantageof the broad powers granted the newborn CIA under the National Security Act of1947. The president, however, took a dim view of a powerful spy agency, fearingthat it might turn into a rogue outfit, and he insisted that the CIA serveprimarily as a coordinator of intelligence reports for the White House.Allen Dulles believed that the shadow war between the West and the Soviet blocwould have few if any rules, and he was contemptuous of any attempts inWashington to put limits on the conflict. He assumed that the United Statesfaced an utterly ruthless enemy in Moscow, and he was prepared to match or gobeyond whatever measures were employed by Russia’s KGB and the Eastern bloc’sother security services. Dulles’s aggressive Cold War stance found a key ally inPresident Truman’s defense secretary, James V. Forrestal, a former Wall Streetinvestment banker at Dillon, Read who moved in Dulles’s circles and who sharedDulles’s suspicions about the Soviet Union. In early 1948, Forrestal persuadedthe politically vulnerable Truman, who knew he was facing a tough challenge fromDewey, to appoint Dulles to a blue-ribbon committee to study the year-old CIAand propose ways to make it more effective.The so-called Dulles-Jackson-Correa Committee, over which Dulles quickly assumedcontrol, allowed him to roam freely through the halls of the new intelligenceagency and develop a plan for how to give it teeth. The committee’s report wasconveniently timed for January 1949, when Tom Dewey would presumably beinaugurated as president and Dulles would take over the CIA. The 193-page reportwould conclude its sharply critical assessment of the CIA by demanding that theagency take off its gloves in the growing confrontation with the Soviet Union.The CIA, it declared, “has the duty to act.” The agency “has been given, by law,wide authority.” It was time to take full advantage of these generous powers,the committee insisted.Dulles and Forrestal didn’t wait for the report to be finished before takingtheir own action. In March 1948, James Angleton flew back from Rome to meet withDulles, warning his mentor that Italy’s Communist Party was on the verge oftaking power in the upcoming national elections in April. Seeing an opportunityfor the kind of decisive counterattack that they had long envisioned against theCommunist advance in Europe, Dulles and Forrestal flew into action, raisingmillions of dollars to tilt the election in favor of the U.S.-supportedChristian Democrats. Within days, a satchel stuffed with American cash was beinghanded off to Italian agents at Rome’s Hassler Hotel, the luxurious villa atopthe Spanish Steps favored by Dulles during his stays in the Eternal City. Morecash would soon come pouring in. The massive infusion of campaign money and U.S.aid ensured victory for the U.S. government’s political clients. On the eveningof April 17, the first day of Italian voting, Dulles scrutinized the electiontallies from Rome at Forrestal’s home in Washington. The two men raised a toastwhen it became clear that the Italian Communists had suffered a stunning defeat.In November, Dulles suffered his own electoral defeat when Truman pulled off ashocking upset over Dewey. It was a humiliating reversal of fortune, not justfor Dewey but for the Dulles brothers.Soon afterward, Allen would lose his strongest ally in the Trumanadministration, Jim Forrestal, when the president ousted the Dulles ally fromthe Pentagon. By the time he was pushed out, Forrestal was showing signs ofsevere nervous exhaustion. Angry and despondent about his ouster, he beganspiraling quickly downward, ranting about how the Soviets had infiltratedWashington and how they had marked him for liquidation. Early in the morning ofMay 22, 1949, after Forrestal was checked into the Bethesda Naval Hospital forpsychiatric evaluation, he squeezed through the small bathroom window of hissixteenth-floor hospital suite and fell to his death. The tragic collapse of thedefense secretary, a man who had controlled America’s fearsome arsenal, was oneof the stranger episodes of the Cold War.With the Democrats maintaining control of the White House in the election of1948, the Dulles brothers’ dream of running U.S. foreign policy seemed dashed.But Allen would find ways to stay in the spy game, no matter who was president.In June 1949, Dulles organized the National Committee for a Free Europe inconjunction with an illustrious board that included General Dwight D.Eisenhower, Hollywood director Cecil B. DeMille, and Time-Life publishingmagnate (and close friend) Henry Luce. Ostensibly a private philanthropic group,the committee was actually a CIA front that channeled funds to anti-CommunistEuropean émigrés and financed major propaganda efforts like Radio Free Europe.At least $2 million of the money poured into the committee’s clandestineprojects came from the Nazi gold that Dulles had helped track down at the end ofthe war. In the early years of the Cold War, the Nazi treasure looted fromJewish families and German-occupied nations would become a key source of fundingfor Dulles’s secret operations.Private citizen Dulles further spread his influence by inserting close allieslike Frank Wisner in key intelligence posts. Like Dulles, Wisner was a formerWall Street lawyer who had fallen for the glamour of espionage life. In 1949,Dulles helped create a new intelligence outpost and buried it in the StateDepartment bureaucracy under a purposefully dull name—the Office of PolicyCoordination. Despite its innocuous title, the OPC would evolve into the kind ofcombative agency that Dulles envisioned the CIA becoming in a Deweyadministration. Wisner was maneuvered into position as OPC chief, and under hisgung ho leadership, the obscure unit quickly threw itself into the black arts ofespionage, including sabotage, subversion, and assassination. By 1952, the OPCwas running forty-seven overseas stations, and its staff had ballooned to nearlythree thousand employees, with another three thousand independent contractors inthe field.Dulles and Wisner were essentially operating their own private spy agency. TheOPC was run with little government oversight and few moral restrictions. Many ofthe agency’s recruits were ex-Nazis. While President Truman continued to regardthe primary purpose of an intelligence agency as the gathering of informationfor the president and his national security advisers, Dulles and Wisner wereengaged in their own no-holds-barred war with the Soviet bloc. They saw EasternEurope as their primary battlefield in the great struggle to roll back theSoviet advance, but their field of combat often strayed into the sovereignterritory of U.S. allies such as France, West Germany, and Italy.During World War II, Dulles had resolutely pursued his own initiatives inSwitzerland, often in conflict with the policies of President Roosevelt. Now, inthe early years of the Cold War, he was doing the same, directly under the noseof another Democratic president. Although the OPC’s tactics had been sanctionedby a National Security Council memo titled “NSC 10/2,” which had been formulatedin the heat of the 1948 presidential campaign—when Truman was fending off Deweyand the Republicans’ charges that he was soft on Communism—it is uncertain howfully informed the president was about the exploits of the Office of PolicyCoordination.Whether or not Truman was fully briefed, Wisner pursued his job with a sense ofdaring abandon, dreaming up ever more inventive and dangerous ways to disruptSoviet rule over its European dominion. Wisner would present his ideas toDulles, as if the Sullivan and Cromwell attorney were still his boss. Dullesfound one of Wisner’s brainstorms particularly intriguing. The idea was sparkedin May 1949 when British intelligence informed Wisner that one of Dulles’sformer wartime assets, a man named Noel Field, was planning to fly to Prague,where an attractive academic post was being dangled before him.Why shouldn’t U.S. intelligence take advantage of Field’s ill-advised journeybehind the Iron Curtain? Wisner had acquired a high-placed double agent insidethe Polish security service, a man named Józef Światło. He could be told tospread the word, all the way from Warsaw to Moscow, that Field was actuallycoming to Prague on a secret mission, sent by his old spymaster, the infamousAllen Dulles. While in Prague, Field would be contacting his extensive networkfrom the war years—the brave Communists, nationalists, and antifascists he hadhelped to survive when he was a refugee aid worker. These men and women were allpart of the top secret Dulles-Field spy network.None of this was true—but Wisner and Dulles knew that if they could successfullyplant this seed in Stalin’s mind, they might wreak havoc throughout the fragileSoviet empire.Allen Dulles had a long history with the Field family. Most men with this sortof connection to a family would have found it impossible to use such oldacquaintances as pawns in a game of geopolitical intrigue. But Dulles was notlike most men. His plan was heartless but inspired. By turning the unsuspectingField family into members of a far-reaching U.S. spy ring, Dulles would panicStalin—already rattled by the 1948 defection of Yugoslavia’s Marshal Tito—intolaunching witch hunts that would fracture the Communist governments throughoutEastern Europe. As with all the bold counterintelligence gambits he undertookduring his career, Dulles threw himself into the Field affair with great relish,even personally giving it a code name: Operation Splinter Factor.Dulles had first met the Fields in Switzerland during World War I, when he triedto recruit Noel’s father as a spy. Herbert Haviland Field was aHarvard-educated, internationally renowned zoologist who ran a scientificinstitute in Zurich dedicated to the encyclopedic classification of the animalkingdom. The senior Field—a devout Quaker with a full, Darwinian beard—turnedDulles down, but he did feed him bits of information from time to time, and heinvited the young diplomat to his home for dinners. It was here—in the Fields’four-story, hilltop villa overlooking Lake Zurich—that Dulles became acquaintedwith Noel and his three siblings. A shy, gangly adolescent at the time, with along face and soft, searching, green eyes, Noel impressed Dulles, when he askedthe boy what he wanted to be, by earnestly declaring, “I want to work for worldpeace.” Noel became deeply committed to pacifism during the war, when he sawtrainloads of horribly maimed soldiers in transit through neutral Switzerland.After Armistice, his Quaker father reinforced the boy’s feelings by taking himon a tour of the war’s blood-soaked battlefields.When his father died suddenly of a heart attack after the war, a grief-strickenNoel vowed to dedicate his life to becoming a “saint” and helping lift thesorrows of mankind. He enrolled at Harvard, his father’s alma mater, and afterstorming through his courses in two years and writing his dissertation on theLeague of Nations and disarmament, he graduated with honors in 1924. Shortlyafterward, he married his Swiss-German sweetheart, Herta, whom he had knownsince they were both nine. Noel then applied for the U.S. Foreign Service,deciding with typical moral gravity that it was “by far the most practical fieldin which an individual can do his bit towards international understanding.” In1926, after passing the exams, Noel and Herta moved to Washington, D.C., wherehe began work as a junior foreign officer at the State Department.From the very beginning, Noel was an odd man out in the insular world of theState Department, whose preppy officers liked to think of themselves as “apretty good club.” Noel was bookish and idealistic, and he betrayed asentimental weakness for the left-wing causes of the day, from the trial ofanarchists Sacco and Vanzetti to the Bonus March of impoverished war veterans onWashington in 1932 that turned violent when General Douglas MacArthur unleashedhis troops on the protesters. While other young foreign service officers weredining with their own kind at Washington’s exclusive clubs, Noel and Herta wouldfrequent the capital’s racially segregated theaters, where they sat with theirblack friends. The Fields also invited their racially mixed circle to their homein downtown Washington, a modest apartment overrun with cats.Although he did not join the Communist Party, Noel was intrigued by the Sovietrevolution, which he began to see as the hope for a world torn apart by war,greed, and poverty. He taught himself Russian by listening to phonographrecords. He liked the sound of the language and wanted to read Lenin and Stalinin the original.In a later era, Noel and Herta Field would have been just another young,free-spirited couple, given to utopian dreams, book clubs, nature hikes, andcamping. But in the Washington of the late 1920s and early 1930s, as the growingmisery of the Great Depression pushed the desperate and the idealistic inextreme directions, the Fields seemed marked for trouble.In 1934, the couple fell in with a Viennese woman named Hede Massing, who turnedout to be a Soviet intelligence agent. Noel began secretly passing informationand copies of documents to Massing. But, increasingly tormented by his dualloyalties, he decided to quit the State Department, and in 1935 Noel and Hertamoved to Geneva, where he took a job with the disarmament section of the Leagueof Nations.Field thought that by returning to Switzerland, he could maintain an honorableneutrality. For the rest of his overseas career—which took Noel from his Leagueof Nations post to humanitarian work on behalf of Nazi refugees during World WarII—he convinced himself that he could in good conscience serve his own countryas well as the Soviet Union. But in the end, he would be crushed between theseimplacable forces. Both sides saw the dreamy Field as a useful victim. EarlBrowder, leader of the U.S. Communist Party, would anoint him “a stupid child inthe woods.” As for Allen Dulles, the man who was so impressed by the teenageField’s sincerity, he came to see him as just another of those “little mice”whose necks would soon be snapped.During the war, Field volunteered to work for Dulles, using his cover as aUnitarian Service Committee relief worker to transmit information back and forthacross the Swiss border and to deliver packages of OSS cash to resistancefighters in France. Noel was particularly useful as a conduit to the GermanCommunist underground. The Fields’ foster daughter, Erica, also proved helpfulfor Dulles, bicycling guns and medicine across the border to France.It was clear that Noel’s antifascist work had a Communist tilt. In February1945, he arrived at the OSS office in Paris with Dulles’s written blessing.Field met with young OSS officer Arthur Schlesinger Jr., the future historianand Kennedy White House aide. Field proposed that the OSS subsidize therecruitment of left-wing German refugees in France, who would be dropped insideliberated areas of Germany, where they would begin to establish the country’snew political foundations. Schlesinger, a man of the left, but an ardentanti-Communist, immediately sniffed out Field’s proposal as a scheme to give theSoviet Union a head start in the occupation of Germany.Schlesinger took a strong disliking to Field. Years later, he would describe himas a “Quaker Communist, filled with idealism, smugness and sacrifice.” Or, asanother observer put it, Field exuded “the arrogance of humility.” InSchlesinger’s estimation, he was less of a dangerous figure than a pathetic one.His pious dedication to the Soviet cause “did little damage to the interests ofthe United States.” Nonetheless, after their Paris meeting, Schlesinger stronglyadvised his OSS superiors against buying into Field’s scheme for postwarGermany.Dulles ended up funding Field’s project anyway, which later resulted in muchridicule from his counterparts in British intelligence. Some observers havesuggested that this is why, later on, Dulles was able to betray Field with suchease, spreading the lie that he was a secret agent working behind the IronCurtain for the Americans. But when Dulles decided to feed Noel Field toStalin—and then, one at a time, three of his family members—there was probablyvery little spleen involved, just cold calculation.After Noel dropped out of sight in Prague, his family implored Dulles to help.He had been a guest in the family’s Zurich home. Both Field and his father hadput themselves at his service. But Dulles did nothing to rescue Field. And hedid nothing to prevent Noel’s family members from walking headlong into the sametrap.Three months into his long ordeal as a captive of Poland’s Stalinist regime,Noel’s brother Hermann was taken from his cell for another round of grilling.This time Hermann’s interrogator was someone like himself—a tweedy, academictype in his forties. He seemed eager to help Hermann out of his predicament, ifonly he would fully cooperate. There was no use in playing games any longer:Polish security knew that he and his brother were part of a conspiracy againstthe peace-loving peoples of the Communist world.Hermann, a political innocent whose ideology amounted to nothing more than akind of do-gooder Quakerism, was utterly confused. He had no clue about why he,or his brother, had fallen into this Kafkaesque nightmare. “But you’re nottalking sense,” he told his inquisitor. “What conspiracy? Tell me what I havedone to you. Give me just one example.”The tweedy man began pacing back and forth in front of the stool where Hermannsat. Suddenly he stopped and blurted out, “Who is Allen Dulles? Mr. Field, tellme precisely, what were your contacts with Allen Dulles, and what was the natureof your assignments from him?”Hermann’s interrogator clearly thought that by abruptly invoking Dulles’s name,Field would finally crumble. But the question only served to deepen Hermann’sconfusion. Field had been too young to remember meeting Dulles as a child inZurich. He had only a vague memory of the name.“There’s a John Foster Dulles,” Hermann tried helpfully. “That’s the only oneI’m sure of. He’s some sort of adviser on foreign affairs to the RepublicanParty.”But the interrogator would have none of this evasion. He kept on badgeringHermann, hour after hour. “I felt like I was in an insane asylum,” Field laterrecalled.In fact, the mysterious Allen Dulles was at the center of Hermann Field’sordeal. Field just didn’t realize it.Operation Splinter Factor succeeded beyond the OPC’s wildest dreams. Stalinbecame convinced that the Fields were at the center of a wide-ranging operationto infiltrate anti-Soviet elements into leadership positions throughout theEastern bloc. The Dulles-Wisner plot aggravated the Soviet premier’s alreadyrampant paranoia, resulting in an epic reign of terror that, before it finallyran its course, would destroy the lives of untold numbers of people. Hundreds ofthousands throughout Eastern Europe were arrested; many were tortured andexecuted. In Czechoslovakia, where nearly 170,000 Communist Party members wereseized as suspects in the make-believe Field plot, the political crisis grew sosevere that the economy nearly collapsed.Anyone whose life had been even remotely touched by Noel Field during his warrelief work was subject to the sweeping purge. Many of the officials rounded uphad been war heroes in their countries—antifascist fighters who survived theNazi occupation only to be falsely accused as traitors by Stalin’s secretpolice. Most victims were independent-minded nationalists, the sort of leaderswho put their own people’s interests ahead of blind obedience to Moscow. Jewishofficials, whose “cosmopolitan” and “Zionist” sensibilities aroused suspicion,also bore the brunt of Stalin’s crackdown.Back in Washington, Wisner exulted over each wave of arrests and each new roundof show trials, where the accused were made to publicly condemn themselvesbefore they were executed. “The comrades are merrily sticking knives in eachothers’ backs and doing our dirty work for us,” Wisner gleefully reported.The Office of Policy Coordination men knew that many of the Splinter Factorvictims were patriots who were beloved by their own people. But, in the eyes ofDulles, this actually made them more dangerous. As one political observer ofSplinter Factor remarked, “Dulles wished to leave Eastern Europe devoid of hopeso that he could introduce a pro-American, anti-Soviet form of government. . . .Nationalist Communists were making communism acceptable to the people, and so,accordingly, they had to be removed.”As a result of the rapidly spreading inquisition, political dialogue in EasternEurope was frozen, the screws of thought control were tightened, and culturalexchange and trade with the West were shut down. But Dulles saw all this as apositive development. Like the most rigid of Marxists, he believed that byincreasing the suffering of Eastern Europe’s enslaved populations, they would bepushed beyond their breaking point and forced to revolt against their Sovietmasters. But, as was the case with the Communist true believers who advocated“heightening the contradictions” in order to bring about the gloriousrevolution, Operation Splinter Factor brought only more misery to the people ofthe Soviet bloc. Dulles would not live long enough to see their day ofliberation.Erica Wallach was freed from her arctic gulag in 1954, after Stalin died and the“Field conspiracy” was finally exposed behind the Iron Curtain for what it was—adevilishly clever Allen Dulles brainstorm. She was released into the custody ofSoviet secret police officials, who apologized and offered her money, and thentook her to East Berlin, where they put her in a taxi to the West. She walked tofreedom through the Brandenburg Gate, exactly where she had started herharrowing journey five years and two months earlier.The Fields, too, were released that year. Hermann returned to the United States,where he became an urban studies professor and a pioneering environmentalist atTufts University and wrote novels. Noel and Herta shocked their family bystaying in Hungary, where they quietly lived out the rest of their lives. ForNoel, the personal betrayal by Dulles and his own country was, in the end, moreunforgivable than the years of abuse at the hands of his Communist comrades. “Hewould never talk to me about his years in prison,” Hermann said about hisbrother. “He dismissed the episode as a Stalinist aberration. He was a truebeliever . . . to the end of his life.”Wallach was eager to reunite with her husband and their two children, althoughso much time had gone by, she was unsure how she would begin again with herfamily. It would take two years before U.S. authorities finally allowed her toenter the United States. “I was continuously interrogated—let’s put it thatway,” she later said. “Not interviewed, interrogated. My visa was refused threetimes, even though I had an American husband and American children living here.”The irony was not lost on her. The official mind-set on both sides of the ColdWar looking glass was remarkably the same. The American interrogators keptasking the same questions that their Soviet counterparts had.After she was finally allowed into the United States, Wallach settled into acomfortable life with her family. Her husband had begun a successful career as abanker in Washington, and they lived in the lush Virginia horse country, not farfrom the new international airport that would be named for John Foster Dulles.Wallach taught French and Latin at the exclusive Highland School.Wallach wrote a book about her years in captivity, but she didn’t believe herordeal bestowed any special distinction on her. “From a European point of view,”she drily observed, “this is a rather common story.”Years later, Wallach came to realize that Dulles had played some significantrole in her suffering. Wallach had worked briefly for Dulles immediately afterthe war, at the OSS base outside Wiesbaden, Germany, where the spy agency hadtaken over the gilded headquarters of the Henkell sparkling wine company.Wallach was one of the few OSS women on Dulles’s payroll at the time, and shehad undoubtedly caught his eye. She had also worked with Frank Wisner at thewinery. But neither man ever expressed any regrets for what they had done to theyoung mother.A few months before she died, in 1993, Wallach recalled her story for ajournalist who found his way to her grand house in the northern Virginiacountryside. In the final stages of the cancer that would claim her, she seemedto float above her own life in a way that gave her a lofty yet clear-eyedperspective on the past. She could even appreciate—in a detached sort of way—thespycraft behind the Dulles operation that had ambushed her life. “Allen Dulles’smotives are easy to imagine,” she remarked. “Anything that destabilized thesituation in Eastern Europe was good for U.S. interests. Stalin was paranoidenough. The crackdown was real enough. By fanning the flames, you could turn thepeople against communism. The strategy is completely understandable.”She could even see how Noel Field made such a tempting mouse for someone likeDulles. “And then we have this fool Noel Field, a romantic, he had beeneverywhere, he was full of these enthusiasms, he went back and forth into thesecountries freely. I don’t think Allen Dulles hated Noel Field, not at all. Butthe opportunity was too good to miss.”And yet, even in her enlightened state, Erica Wallach was not prepared toentirely forgive Allen Dulles. There was something disturbing about the man, athis core, that she wanted to put on record while she still had time. “Dulles hada certain arrogance in which he believed that he could work with theDevil—anybody’s Devil—and still be Allen Dulles,” she told her visitor. “Hecould work with Noel Field and betray him. He could work with the Nazis or withthe Communists. He thought himself untouchable by these experiences and, ofcourse, you cannot help be touched, be affected, no matter how noble your causeis.”"},{"pageContent":"8 [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-21]SCOUNDREL TIME [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-21]In late August 1947, Richard M. Nixon, a freshman congressman from SouthernCalifornia, arrived in New York City to board the luxurious Queen Mary for afact-finding tour of war-ravaged Europe that he would later call “one of thegreatest thrills of my life.” Nixon’s parents came to see off their ambitiousson, and before the ocean liner embarked, the family took in a performance ofthe long-running Broadway musical Oklahoma! The young congressman was part of anineteen-member delegation chaired by Representative Christian Herter, apatrician Republican from Massachusetts tasked with investigating thedevastation of the war. President Truman hoped the bipartisan delegation’swell-publicized trip would help him win congressional approval for the MarshallPlan, his ambitious, multibillion-dollar aid package to reconstruct Europe.Truman’s sweeping proposal was generating stiff opposition from GOPconservatives, who saw it as another example of Democratic extravagance.Back home in Whittier, California, one of the conservative businessmen who hadhelped pave Dick Nixon’s successful entry into politics the previous year warnedthe young congressman not to be taken in by the slick State Department typesduring the European junket. The country could only rid itself of “the hangoverphilosophies of the New Deal” if Republican congressmen like Nixon were “wiseenough to refuse to be drawn into support of a dangerously unworkable andprofoundly inflationary foreign policy.”Herter, a Boston Brahmin who was married to a Standard Oil heiress, was part ofthe bipartisan, internationalist political elite who rejected this type ofthinking as narrow-minded and isolationist. Herter’s circle saw the MarshallPlan not only as an essential antidote to the growing appeal of Communism inpoverty-stricken Western Europe, but as a financial boon for America’s exportindustries and international banks, which would profit enormously from therevival of European markets. Herter asked one of his oldest friends to accompanythe delegation—Allen Dulles, a man who shared his views and was well known forhis powers of persuasion. (Dulles had another motive for backing the MarshallPlan: he and Frank Wisner would later use funds skimmed from the program tofinance their anti-Soviet operations in Europe.) As young diplomats in Bernduring World War I, Dulles and Herter had shared the joys of bachelor life. Now,the Herter Committee’s round-trip, transatlantic journey and lengthy tour ofEurope—a political expedition that would stretch for longer than twomonths—would give Dulles and Herter ample opportunity to win over conservativeskeptics like young Dick Nixon.The opulent accommodations on board the Queen Mary were a far cry from the drabveterans’ halls and school auditoriums where Nixon had been spending his daysjust a few months earlier on the campaign trail. On the eve of his trip, Nixonhad earnestly declared, “This will be no junket. It will be no cross-Atlanticcocktail party.” But in between delegation meetings, the luxury liner offered awealth of diversions, from its grand, three-story-high dining salon, to itselegant, tiled swimming pool, to its Art Deco–style observation bar withdazzling ocean views. The storied cruise ship had hosted the likes of ClarkGable, Greta Garbo, Fred Astaire, Winston Churchill, and General Eisenhower. Itwas all heady stuff for the thirty-four-year-old Nixon, whose Quaker family’sgrocery store and gas station had always wobbled on the brink of bankruptcy.Throughout his career, Nixon’s all-consuming ambition was fueled by resentmentand envy, by the sense that he would always be excluded from the top decks wheremen like Allen Dulles and Christian Herter belonged. When Nixon was finishinglaw school at Duke University in 1937, he spent a frigid Christmas week in NewYork searching for a starting position with a prestigious Wall Street firm. Hemanaged to get on the appointments calendar at Sullivan and Cromwell, the firmof his dreams. As he waited in the lobby, he marveled at the “thick, luxuriouscarpets and the fine oak paneling,” a picture of corporate power and comfortthat stayed with him for many years. But he did not meet the Dulles brothersduring his job interview, and Sullivan and Cromwell—which, like all the top NewYork firms of the day, drew their young talent almost exclusively from the IvyLeague—showed no interest in this product of Whittier College and Duke Law.Nixon, who could only afford a room in the Sloane House YMCA on WestThirty-Fourth Street during his weeklong job hunt, felt a bitter sense ofrejection by the time he returned to school. “He was not charmed by New York,”remembered a Duke classmate of Nixon’s. He felt the city had kicked him in theteeth.Yet here he was, ten years later, being wined and dined on the Queen Mary in thesame privileged company as Allen Dulles. The spymaster and Herter took the youngcongressman under their wing during the ocean crossing. They schooled him aboutthe importance of foreign aid as a facilitator of U.S. economic and politicalinterests. By the time the delegation returned to the United States in earlyOctober, Nixon was fully on board as a supporter of the Marshall Plan. Thecongressman’s new enthusiasm for Truman’s ambitious proposal did not go downwell with his conservative supporters back home. But Nixon was shrewd enough tofigure out that senior members of the GOP’s East Coast elite like Dulles andHerter could be of more benefit to him than the Southern California citrusgrowers and businessmen who had launched his career.The political relationship forged between the rising politician from Californiaand Dulles’s East Coast circle would become one of the most significantpartnerships of the postwar era. Nixon grew into a potent political weapon forthe Dulles group, a cunning operator who managed to accrue solidly conservativecredentials with the Republican Party’s popular base while dependably servingthe interests of the GOP’s privileged leadership class. Together, the Dullescircle and Richard Nixon would bring about a sharp, rightward shift in thenation’s politics, driving out the surviving elements of the New Deal regime inWashington and establishing a new ruling order that was much more in tune withthe Dulles circle’s financial interests. The Dulles-Nixon alliance provedmasterful at exploiting the Cold War panic that gripped the nation, using it toroot out Rooseveltian true believers from government, along with a few genuineCommunist infiltrators who posed a marginal threat to national security. WhenWashington’s anti-Communist witch hunt raged out of control and threatened toconsume even those who had lit the flame, Nixon again proved of great use toDulles, working with him to keep the inferno within safe boundaries. In returnfor his services, Nixon won the patronage of the kingmakers in the Dullescircle, ensuring the politician’s steady rise toward Washington’s top throne.Years later, after Nixon’s climb to power was stalled by his loss to John F.Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election, Dulles sent Nixon a warm letter,reminiscing about their relationship and noting that “we have worked togethersince the days of the mission on the Marshall Plan.” The Dulles-Nixon allianceactually preceded their voyage on the Queen Mary, but the spymaster wasunderstandably loath to officially record its true origins. According to JohnLoftus, the former Justice Department Nazi hunter, the two men first came incontact in late 1945, when young naval officer Richard Nixon was shuttling upand down the East Coast, wrapping up war-related business for the Navy. Whilesifting through the military paperwork, Nixon came across eye-opening Nazidocuments that had been shipped to an old torpedo factory on the Virginia sideof the Potomac. Some of these documents revealed how the Dulles brothers hadhelped launder Nazi funds during the war. Loftus, citing confidentialintelligence sources, alleged that Dulles and Nixon proceeded to cut a deal.“Allen Dulles,” reported Loftus, “told him to keep quiet about what he had seenand, in return, [Dulles] arranged to finance the young man’s first congressionalcampaign against Jerry Voorhis.”Dulles and his clients in the banking and oil industries had ample reason totarget Voorhis, a five-term Democratic congressman and ardent New Dealer fromNixon’s home district in Southern California. The crusading congressman was aparticularly troublesome thorn in the sides of Wall Street and Big Oil. Voorhisshook the banking industry by pushing for the federal government to take overthe nation’s privately owned, regional Federal Reserve Banks—a radical proposalthat briefly won President Roosevelt’s support, but ultimately failed toovercome the banking lobby. Voorhis was more successful in his efforts to curbthe power of the major oil companies. In 1943, after learning that the Navy wasabout to grant Standard Oil exclusive drilling rights in the sprawling Elk Hillsnaval reserve in central California, Voorhis exposed the sweetheart deal andsucceeded in blocking it. The congressman earned yet more of the oil industry’swrath by taking aim at one of the industry’s most cherished tax breaks, the oildepletion allowance, and by stopping offshore drilling plans along theCalifornia coast.Voorhis also posed a direct legal threat to the Dulles brothers through hisefforts to shine a light on the wartime collusion between Sullivan and Cromwellclients like Standard Oil and DuPont chemical company and Nazi cartels such asIG Farben. Voorhis further unnerved the Dulles circle by demanding acongressional investigation of the controversial Bank for InternationalSettlements, charging that bank president Thomas McKittrick, a close associateof the Dulles brothers, was a Nazi collaborator.Corporate America viewed Washington politicians like Voorhis as thepersonification of their New Deal nightmare. In his midforties, Voorhis had thegranite-jawed good looks of a movie star. He also combined the same upper-classbreeding and populist instincts that made Roosevelt such a formidable threat.The son of an automobile executive, Voorhis was educated at the Hotchkiss Schooland Yale. But as a young man, he rejected his privileged background, marrying asocial worker, going to work on a Ford assembly line, and becoming a Socialist.He changed his registration to the Democratic Party in 1934 when he enteredCalifornia politics, but his congressional voting record demonstrated he was astalwart of the party’s left wing.In 1944, Voorhis published a book titled Beyond Victory, making clear that, as aleader of the progressive caucus in Congress, he was determined to keep pushingfor ambitious reforms in postwar America. Voorhis sent alarms through the ranksof his corporate foes by calling for the nationalization of the transportation,energy, and utility industries as well as sweeping banking reforms. He wanted tocreate a national credit union to compete with private banks and to expand theSocial Security system as a way to establish a nationwide minimum income.Voorhis’s business opponents began searching for a strong candidate to unseattheir nemesis long before the 1946 congressional race. While still in uniform,Nixon was recruited to run against the popular progressive by Herman Perry, afamily friend who managed the Bank of America’s Whittier branch. Nixon laterinsisted that no powerful interests were behind his political debut, just“typical representatives of the Southern California middle class: an autodealer, a bank manager, a printing salesman, a furniture dealer.” But Voorhisknew the truth. He later wrote in an unpublished memoir that he had beentargeted by powerful East Coast bankers and oilmen, who saw him as “one of themost dangerous men in Washington.” In the fall of 1945, according to Voorhis,one major New York banker flew to Southern California, where he sat down withlocal bankers and “bawled them out” for allowing such a progressive firebrand torepresent their district.Nixon knew that it would take a large campaign war chest to defeat the five-termVoorhis—and he also made clear that he was not interested in running for officeif it meant taking a pay cut. Republican business circles in New York and LosAngeles quickly rallied to make the campaign against Voorhis worth the effort oftheir candidate. An executive for Gladding, McBean, a major ceramicsmanufacturer whose chairman sat on Standard Oil’s board, later recalled how thecorporate message on behalf of Nixon was delivered. At a meeting of seventy-fiveexecutives held at an exclusive Ojai, California, resort, the president ofGladding, McBean touted the “young man fresh out of the Navy” who had been linedup for the congressional race. “Smart as all get out. Just what we need to getrid of Jerry Voorhis. . . . He says he can’t live on a congressman’s salary.Needs a lot more than that to match what he knows he could make in private lawpractice. The boys need cash to make up the difference. We’re going to help.”Gladding, McBean became a key generator of cash for Nixon, shaking down its ownexecutives for campaign contributions and spreading the word to other corporatedonors. The company president demanded that his fellow executives deliver themoney in cash to his office. “We just gotta get rid of that pinko Voorhis,” heexhorted his team. The strong-arm appeal worked. Gladding, McBean alone raisedat least $5,000 from its executive ranks, the equivalent of over $65,000 today.Together, Nixon’s corporate backers amassed a campaign “pot big enough to engulfthe world,” as the Gladding, McBean financial officer later put it.Gladding, McBean had a modest enough corporate profile to escape the scrutiny ofelection officials, but its board of directors boasted a variety of high-profileconnections in the political and financial worlds. One director, Los Angelescorporate attorney Herman Phleger, had worked with Allen Dulles in postwarGermany and would later serve his brother as the State Department’s legaladviser. The Nixon-Voorhis contest took place on the opposite side of thecountry from the East Coast power centers—in a remote suburban Californiadistrict where orange groves still dominated the landscape—but its outcome wouldhelp shape national politics for years to come.As the congressional race heated up in summer 1946, it became clear to Nixon’swealthy supporters that they had backed the right man to unseat Voorhis. TheRepublican challenger ran a ruthless campaign, cutting up the incumbent as anineffectual left-wing dreamer, a Communist Party sympathizer, and a tool ofRed-dominated labor unions—none of which was true. In fact, Voorhis had longbattled against Communist Party encroachment in liberal organizations and hadeven spearheaded a 1940 bill requiring the registration of political groups thatwere affiliated with foreign powers—a law aimed as much at the Moscow-dominatedCPUSA as it was against the pro-Hitler German-American Bund. But in Nixon’sskilled hands, Voorhis’s support for New Deal programs like school lunchesbecame evidence of his obedience to the Communist Party line. In the finalstretch of the campaign, Nixon released one last cloud of poison. Votersthroughout the district began receiving anonymous phone calls, which turned outto emanate from Nixon campaign boiler rooms. “This is a friend of yours, but Ican’t tell you who I am,” went a typical call. “Did you know that Jerry Voorhisis a Communist?”The uniformly conservative Southern California press, including the mighty LosAngeles Times, echoed Nixon’s baseless charges against Voorhis andenthusiastically endorsed the Republican candidate. On Election Day, Nixonrolled to an impressive victory, winning 56 percent of the vote. Voorhis was sodismayed by the experience that he abandoned the political arena for the rest ofhis life.An outraged Voorhis aide later confronted Nixon. “Of course I knew Jerry Voorhiswasn’t a Communist,” Nixon told the man. “I had to win,” he went on, as ifenlightening a political innocent. “That’s the thing you don’t understand. Theimportant thing is to win. You’re just being naïve.”As promised, Nixon was well compensated for his efforts. When he and his familyembarked for Washington, they took with them $10,000 (about $130,000 in today’sdollars), a new Ford, and a generous life insurance policy. Nixon also arrivedin the nation’s capital with a game plan for Republican success that wouldembolden the likes of Senator Joseph McCarthy and change American history.Nixon’s bare-knuckled race against the idealistic Voorhis was the politicaloverture of a new era—a “scoundrel time” of patriotic bullying and rampant fear.On August 11, 1948, a warm, sticky evening in New York, Rep. Dick Nixon walkedinto the lobby of the Roosevelt Hotel—the grand, midtown palace named afterTeddy, not FDR—and took the elevator up to the fifteenth floor where GovernorTom Dewey, the Republican candidate for president, kept a suite. The freshmancongressman was, once again, about to demonstrate his value to the Dullesbrothers.Nixon carried in his briefcase the congressional testimony of two men—Alger Hissand Whittaker Chambers—whose epic duel would become one of the defining publicspectacles of the Cold War. Chambers—a senior writer and editor at Time in HenryLuce’s right-leaning publishing empire—had ignited a firestorm by alleging thathe had worked as a courier for a Soviet spy ring in Washington during the 1930s,a ring that included Alger Hiss. The resounding denial by Hiss, a formerhigh-ranking official in Roosevelt’s State Department, was so persuasivelydelivered that the notorious House Un-American Activities Committee on whichNixon served seemed on the verge of terminating its investigation amid a chorusof catcalls from the press.When the committee later reconvened in executive session after Hiss’s “virtuoso”performance, Nixon recalled, his fellow congressmen were “in a virtual state ofshock.” Furious committee members turned on the staff, berating them for notthoroughly vetting Chambers before putting him on the stand. “We’ve been had!We’re ruined,” moaned one Republican. But Nixon stood firm. If HUAC shut downits probe of alleged Communists in federal government, he argued, “far fromrescuing the committee’s reputation, it would probably destroy it for good. Itwould be a public confession that we were incompetent and even reckless in ourprocedures.” His impassioned plea succeeded in steadying the committee’s nerves,and they agreed to carry on. But Nixon knew that before HUAC resumed its publichearings, he needed to get outside help if the committee was to prevail in thearena of popular opinion.The Hiss case, Nixon later wrote in his soul-baring memoir Six Crises, was oneof the defining crucibles in his career. Nixon was often wracked by self-doubt,and this was one of those contests that brought out his deepest anxieties.Nixon’s antagonist boasted all the credentials that had eluded him in life. Hisshad been one of the most brilliant law students in his class at Harvard. Aftergraduating, he was picked to serve as a law clerk to octogenarian Supreme Courtjustice Oliver Wendell Holmes, a living legend of American jurisprudence. Hissquickly became one of the rising stars in the Roosevelt administration, cappinghis Washington career by accompanying FDR to his final summit at Yalta andplaying a key role in the formation of the United Nations.When he appeared before the House Un-American Activities Committee, Hiss made astriking impression—thin, handsome, smartly dressed, and self-assured. EvenNixon had to admit that his performance was a striking contrast to his accuser’s“lackluster” appearance before the committee. Chambers was “short and pudgy,”observed Nixon. “His clothes were unpressed. His shirt collar was curled up overhis jacket. He spoke in a rather bored monotone.” Hiss insisted that he hadnever met anyone named Whittaker Chambers—and he and the rumpled Chambers seemedto come from such different worlds that it was easy to believe him. But it wasChambers whom Nixon found convincing: he simply knew too many details aboutHiss’s personal life. And there was something about this sad sack—a troubled butintelligent man who seemed to exude a strange mix of admiration, envy, andresentment toward Hiss—that strongly resonated with Nixon.Nixon quickly emerged as Hiss’s most dangerous inquisitor, but Hiss held hisground under the young congressman’s relentless questioning, slyly taking aim atthe most vulnerable part of his psyche. “I am a graduate of Harvard Law School,”Hiss coolly informed the committee. He let that sink in, and then fixed Nixonwith a level gaze. “And I believe yours is Whittier?” It was an expertly aimedharpoon, certain to deeply wound the man who was so obviously afflicted by whatsociologists would later term “the hidden injuries of class.”“It absolutely ripped Nixon apart,” recalled Robert Stripling, HUAC’s chiefinvestigator. “I realized from that moment on that he could not stand Hiss.”Nixon knew that he was facing a formidable opponent. Hiss clearly had theWashington press on his side, as well as the White House. While the committeewas interrogating him, President Truman told a press conference that the HUACspy scare was nothing more than a “red herring” to divert Washington from moreimportant business. Hiss’s testimony was full of references to leading politicalpersonalities with whom he was on a familiar basis. And they weren’t allDemocrats. The biggest name he dropped—John Foster Dulles—produced a mighty echoin the cavernous caucus room of the Old House Office Building. Hiss reminded thecommittee that it was the Republican wise man who had offered him his currentposition as president of the prestigious Carnegie Endowment for InternationalPeace, where Foster Dulles served as chairman of the board.Nixon was well aware that Hiss, who accepted Foster Dulles’s offer and took overthe Carnegie Endowment in January 1947, belonged to a Washington aristocracythat transcended party lines. By accusing Alger Hiss of being a traitor to hiscountry, Nixon was not only threatening the career of a well-connected andwidely respected public citizen, he was jeopardizing the reputations of Hiss’sprominent patrons—powerful men like the Dulles brothers, whom Nixon was countingon to advance his own career.When he phoned Foster Dulles at his Wall Street office on the morning of August11—the same office where he had been snubbed as a young law student—Nixonunderstood that it was another make-or-break moment for him. Foster agreed tomeet that evening at Dewey’s hotel suite to discuss the Hiss-Chambers case. TheWall Street attorney appreciated the delicacy of the situation. As Dewey’s topforeign affairs adviser, Foster was poised to become the next secretary ofstate. The last thing he needed was a Washington tempest that tied him to aSoviet spy.For Nixon, the anxiety hovering around the meeting was heightened by the factthat he harbored his own doubts about the case against Hiss. But men of actionlearn to conquer these disquieting voices inside, Nixon reminded himself. “Oneof the most trying experiences an individual can go through is the period ofdoubt, of soul-searching, to determine whether to fight the battle or fly fromit,” Nixon wrote in Six Crises. “It is in such a period that almost unbearabletensions build up, tensions that can be relieved only by taking action, one wayor the other. And significantly, it is this period of crisis conduct thatseparates the leaders from the followers.” A leader acted decisively. Thefailures are “those who are so overcome by doubts that they either crack underthe strain or flee.”Published in 1962, Six Crises was Nixon’s strangely belated answer to Profilesin Courage—the 1957, Pulitzer Prize–winning book by the charismatic man who hadjust beat him for president. Nixon intended his book to be a leadership manual,but it only highlighted his neuroses. Many observers thought Nixon’s desperateself-puffery bordered on hysteria. Writing in his journal after the book’spublication, Arthur Schlesinger Jr. called it “an orgy in unconsciousself-revelation.” President Kennedy told Schlesinger it showed that Nixon was a“sick” man.But, as usual, Nixon’s opponents underestimated him. Nixon may have sufferedfrom a tortured psyche, but it made him acutely sensitive to the nuances ofpower. He had a Machiavellian brilliance for reading the chessboard andcalculating the next series of moves to his advantage.When Nixon walked into Suite 1527 at the Roosevelt Hotel that summer night in1948, he faced a formidable array of power. With Foster were his brother Allen,Christian Herter, and Wall Street banker C. Douglas Dillon, who would laterserve President Eisenhower in the State Department and presidents Kennedy andJohnson as Treasury secretary. These men made up a significant section of theRepublican Party’s ruling clique. If Nixon failed to convince them that he had asolid case against Hiss, HUAC would have to close its noisy show, and hispolitical career would be wrecked just as it was gaining traction.Foster felt that Nixon approached the group with the proper sense of humility,and no doubt trepidation. “It was clear he did not want to proceed [with theHiss investigation] until people like myself had agreed that he really had acase to justify going ahead,” Foster later remarked. Nixon knew that he wasfacing a skeptical audience. Herter, a mentor ever since their Marshall Planjunket, had already told Nixon he didn’t think he had a case. Herter had checkedwith his friends at the State Department, who assured him Hiss was not aCommunist.But Nixon was also aware that he came into the room with his own uniqueleverage. As the leading inquisitor in the Hiss case—an affair whose tendrilslaced their way as far as John Foster Dulles himself—Nixon had the power toupend the Republican presidential campaign.Nixon sat quietly in the suite while the Dulles brothers carefully read throughthe Hiss and Chambers transcripts. When they were done, Foster got to his feetand began pacing the room with his hands clasped behind him. The brothersrealized that Nixon was right—and they had a problem. “There’s no question aboutit,” Foster frowned. “It’s almost impossible to believe, but Chambers knowsHiss.”The Republican wise men took Nixon into their confidence, and once again theambitious young politician came to a mutually convenient arrangement with theDulles circle. It was another significant step for Nixon through the portals ofpower. With the Republican brain trust’s full support, Nixon would continue hisaggressive pursuit of Hiss while keeping the spotlight carefully away fromFoster and other GOP luminaries who were tied to the accused man. Meanwhile,Foster moved quickly to distance himself from Hiss, pressuring him behind thescenes to resign his Carnegie Endowment post, while Allen fed incriminatingintelligence to Nixon to bolster his case. Some of this confidential informationabout Hiss likely came from the Venona project, the Army intelligence programthat had been set up in 1943 to decrypt messages sent by Soviet spy agencies.The Venona project was so top secret that it was kept hidden from PresidentTruman, but the deeply wired Dulles might have enjoyed access to it.Nixon was impressed by the Dulles brothers’ bold decision to politically exploitthe Hiss affair rather than run from it. The HUAC investigation could have been“acutely embarrassing” to Foster, Nixon later noted. The Dulleses “could havesuggested that I delay the proceedings until after the election.” But instead,with Nixon’s help, they turned the Hiss case to their advantage, with Deweyfulminating against the laxity of the Roosevelt and Truman administrations thathad allowed Communists to penetrate the government. The meeting at the RooseveltHotel proved a turning point. For the next decade, Republicans would use ColdWar hysteria not just to indict Communist Party members and sympathizers astraitors but to brand the entire New Deal legacy as un-American. Even formerhigh-ranking New Dealers with impeccable credentials like Alger Hiss would befair game in Washington’s new inquisitorial climate.The age of paranoia brought out Nixon’s brilliance as a political performer. Hehad a deep, demagogic instinct for playing on the public’s darkest fears. RobertStripling, his right-hand man on HUAC, came to believe that there was no genuineideological passion in Nixon’s pursuit of the “traitor” Hiss, just the samecold-blooded calculation he had brought to his campaign against Jerry Voorhis.“He was no more concerned about whether Hiss was [a Communist] than a billygoat,” the HUAC investigator later remarked.This was not an entirely fair assessment of Nixon. The young politician clearlyhad developed deeply felt convictions about the brutality of the Communistsystem. When his Marshall Plan tour took him to Greece, Nixon was horrified tomeet a young woman whose left breast had been hacked off by Communistguerrillas. He returned from the trip with a firm belief in the implacability ofCommunist regimes, and the conviction that they only understood force—a viewthat he would modify when he became president and engaged both the Soviet Unionand China in strenuous diplomacy.But at home, Nixon’s anti-Communism reeked of political cynicism, earning himthe nickname “Tricky Dick.” He smeared his opponents with reckless abandon,labeling them as Reds or “dupes” or, in the case of his 1950 senatorialopponent, Helen Gahagan Douglas, a woman who was “pink down to her underwear.”Nixon never proved that Hiss was a card-carrying Communist or a Soviet agent,but, with typical hyperbole, he treated him like he was a mortal threat to theAmerican way of life.The highlight of Nixon’s obsessive, Javert-like pursuit of Hiss came whenChambers dramatically led HUAC investigators to a pumpkin patch on his Marylandfarm, where he produced a hollowed-out pumpkin containing sixty-five pages ofretyped State Department documents, four pages of copied government documents inHiss’s handwriting, and five rolls of classified film—all of which, Chambersclaimed, had been slipped to him by Hiss in 1938. Nixon staged a dramatic returnto Washington from a Caribbean vacation cruise, with the help of a Coast Guardrescue plane, in order to publicize the so-called pumpkin papers. The documents,which seemed to prove that Hiss did have an espionage connection to Chambers,sealed the diplomat’s fate. He was indicted in December 1948 by a federal grandjury for lying to Congress.Hiss continued to vigorously deny his guilt, insisting that the pumpkin papershad been forged by Chambers. Neither he nor his wife, Priscilla, could haveretyped the State Department documents, said Hiss, because they had given awaythe Woodstock model typewriter that they allegedly used to copy the classifiedmemos before 1938. Four jury members at his first deadlocked trial believedHiss, agreeing that someone other than Hiss or his wife had retyped the StateDepartment documents. Hiss’s suspicion that he was framed was given furthercredence years later by John Dean, the former White House attorney who became akey witness in the Watergate scandal that ended the Nixon presidency. Writing inhis memoir Blind Ambition, Dean alleged that Nixon told fellow White House aideCharles Colson, “We built [the typewriter] in the Hiss case,” implying that withthe help of FBI technicians, Nixon had used a replica of the Woodstock machineto trap his prey.Hiss’s second trial did not go in his favor. Among the witnesses who testifiedagainst him was John Foster Dulles, who disputed Hiss’s recollection of theevents leading to his resignation from the Carnegie Endowment. It was the finalnail in Hiss’s coffin by his former patron. In January 1950, Hiss was convictedof perjury and sentenced to federal prison, where he would serve three and ahalf years. Meanwhile, Chambers, a man who had launched his writing career byworking for the Communist Party press, continued to enjoy his new life as apolemicist for the conservative media, first in Henry Luce’s plush Time-Lifetower and then in the more modest Manhattan offices of William F. Buckley Jr.’sNational Review.For Nixon, the Washington spy spectacle demonstrated not only the moralturpitude of Alger Hiss but the intellectual bankruptcy of the liberal elite.His successful pursuit of Hiss brought him national fame, Nixon later observed,but it also attracted the “unparalleled venom and irrational fury” of theliberal intelligentsia, which saw Hiss as a New Deal icon. He was convinced thathe would never be forgiven by “substantial segments of the press andintellectual community” for exposing how the New Deal had been compromised bythe Communist underground. Nixon brooded that it was this “hatred and hostility”that might have cost him the 1960 presidential election.Chambers, too, saw his decision to incriminate Hiss as part of a broader assaulton New Deal–style government and its “drift toward socialism.” In his 1952memoir Witness, Chambers conflated the Roosevelt presidency with the evils ofCommunist rule. The New Deal, he wrote, “was not a revolution by violence. Itwas a revolution by bookkeeping and lawmaking.” Both types of revolution, heargued, led to a triumph of the state over the individual.The Cold War furies that Nixon and the Dulles brothers helped to unleash scouredall nuance and charity from American politics. There were indeed a few committedCommunist agents embedded here and there in Roosevelt’s bureaucracy, such asNathan Silvermaster, a Russian-born economist with the War Production Boardduring World War II who was dedicated to the dream of a Soviet America. But byfar the more common “traitors” were men like Hiss: well-educated, progressiveidealists. They were the type who had come of age after the stock market crashof 1929 and had grown sick of a hands-off government that allowed encampments ofhungry and homeless people to spring up all over the country without takingaction.When Roosevelt was elected in 1932, and Hiss received a telegram from FelixFrankfurter, his former Harvard law professor and an adviser to FDR, urging himto come work for the new administration “on the basis of national emergency,”Hiss knew that he had to sign up. For young New Dealers, “it was a call to arms,being told that the nation was in danger. I think many of us who went down [toWashington] in those first few weeks thought of ourselves as civilian militiagoing down for the duration of a real emergency, as if we were going to war.Roosevelt, in his first inaugural address, used the sacrifices of war as ananalogy.”In despair over the enormous human suffering of the Depression, with somefifteen million jobless—a quarter of the U.S. labor force—some of these NewDealers found themselves drawn, at least for a time, to the discipline andmilitancy of the Communist Party. Some were intrigued by the Soviet economicexperiment, which appeared at least comparatively functional, and thought theirown ailing capitalist system might learn something from it. During World War II,when the Roosevelt administration urged Americans to regard the Russians asindispensable comrades-in-arms, some of these federal officials looked for waysto strengthen these bonds by sharing information with our allies. But while someof these men and women crossed the line, most saw themselves as patriots whosedreams for the future were deeply rooted in American traditions, not Europeanideologies. Roosevelt was their guiding light, not Stalin.To this day, Alger Hiss—who was convicted of perjury, not treason—remains aconundrum, his guilt or innocence still hotly debated along ideological lines.When the Venona decrypts were declassified in the 1990s, some saw smoking-gunproof of his guilt, while others argued that the case had only entered an evenmurkier stage. In the end, Hiss will likely be seen as a perplexingly mixed bag:a fundamentally loyal American who had associated with left-wing circles inWashington and was not entirely forthcoming with Congress, but was never aserious threat to national security.The least credible aspect of Hiss’s testimony was his insistence that he hadnever known “an individual by the name of Whittaker Chambers.” When Nixon laterstaged a face-to-face meeting between the two men, Hiss finally acknowledgedthat he had known Chambers, though under another name, and only briefly in 1935.But the evidence pointed to a more intricate relationship than that. Thepolitical complexity of the Hiss case was further entangled by its interpersonalcomplications. Although a married man with children, Chambers confessed to theFBI that he had led a secret homosexual life. He was clearly enamored of Hissand his family. In Witness, he wrote that he came to regard Alger and PriscillaHiss “as friends as close as a man ever makes in life.” Under questioning fromNixon, Chambers warmly described Hiss—the man whose life he was in the processof ruining—as “a man of great simplicity and a great gentleness and sweetness ofcharacter.” It was a far cry from how Nixon viewed the “cold and callous” Hiss.Chambers recounted the final meeting he allegedly had with Hiss—when he went toHiss’s Washington home in 1938 to beg the diplomat to leave the CommunistParty—with the wounded clarity of a man remembering a lovers’ breakup: “Welooked at each other steadily for a moment, believing that we were seeing eachother for the last time and knowing that between us lay . . . a molten torrent.When we turned to walk in different directions from that torrent, it would be asmen whom history left no choice but to be enemies. As we hesitated, tears cameinto Alger Hiss’s eyes—the only time I ever saw him so moved. He has denied thispublicly and derisively. . . . He should not regret those few tears, for as longas men are human, and remember our story, they will plead for his humanity.”Hiss came to believe that Chambers’s accusations against him were those of arejected suitor. Chambers had never made sexual advances, said Hiss, but “hisattitude to me, and his relations, were strange . . . he had a hostility to thepoint of jealousy about my wife. . . . My guess is that he had some obscure kindof love attachment . . . about me.”Hiss’s reluctance to acknowledge his relationship with his accuser might havebeen due to his uneasiness about the nature of his involvement with the man.Nixon concluded that Hiss had reciprocated Chambers’s passion and that ahomosexual drama lay at the heart of the political tempest. “The true story ofthe Hiss case,” Nixon revealed to a congressional confidante on board hispresidential yacht a quarter century later, was that Hiss and Chambers had been“queers.”But whatever human subtleties might have explained the Hiss affair were poundedto dust by the blunt instruments of Cold War discourse. The investigativeapparatus that Nixon and his patrons built in Washington had no way to measurepolitical nuances and peculiarities of the heart.Alger Hiss had moved in political circles viewed as benign in Roosevelt’sWashington but would take on a sinister cast in the panicky atmosphere of theCold War. Even Allen Dulles had worked with Communists during the war. After thewar, you could remain a Communist or Socialist in Western Europe and still begranted a place in the democratic arena. But not in Washington. There, even NewDealers were in danger.On August 13, 1948, two days after Nixon met with the Dulles group at theRoosevelt Hotel, the HUAC “show trial”—as the hearings were being called in theliberal press—resumed in the Old House Office Building. Once again, the palatialcaucus room, with its Greek revival décor and glittering chandeliers, was thescene of a media extravaganza. The day’s leading witness was a man whom manyconsidered the committee’s top target, since he had held a considerably moreimportant post in the Roosevelt administration than Hiss.Harry Dexter White was a slight, bespectacled, fifty-five-year-old formergovernment economist whose name meant little to the general public. But as thebig thinker in Henry Morgenthau’s Treasury Department, White had played a majorrole in shaping New Deal policy. Among his many accomplishments was the creationof the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, two linchpins of thepostwar global financial order that White was widely credited with spearheading.White joined forces with the esteemed British economist John Maynard Keynes tohammer out the plans for the world’s new financial system, but while Keynesprovided substantial intellectual input, it was the politically savvy White whowas key to bringing the plans to fruition. White would later be hailed as“arguably the most important U.S. government economist of the 20th century.”There is little doubt that Harry Dexter White was one of the main topics fordiscussion, along with Alger Hiss, at the Roosevelt Hotel that night in August1948. In fact, the Dulles group saw White as a bigger threat to their postwarplans than Hiss. The formidable White was intent on building a new financialorder that would be a “New Deal for a new world,” with the new globalinstitutions channeling investment to needy countries in ways that produced thebroadest public good rather than the greatest private gain. When the Rooseveltadministration unveiled its plans for the World Bank and IMF, SecretaryMorgenthau declared that the goal was “to drive . . . the usurious money lendersfrom the temple of international finance.” Not surprisingly, Wall Street bankssaw the new institutions, which were to be “instrumentalities of sovereigngovernments and not of private financial interests,” as dangerous newcompetitors in the global capital markets.For the Dulles group, there were a number of disquieting developments at theBretton Woods Conference, held in the green foothills of New Hampshire in thesummer of 1944, where 730 delegates from around the world thrashed out the finalplans for the new financial system. Morgenthau and White led a movement at theconference to abolish the Bank for International Settlements, an institutionthey saw as an instrument of financial collaboration among New York, London, andNazi Germany. It took a major, behind-the-scenes campaign at Bretton Woods—aneffort mounted by representatives of Wall Street, the State Department, and theBank of England—to head off the Morgenthau-White assault on BIS, which the NewDealers wanted to replace with the World Bank and the International MonetaryFund.White further unnerved Wall Street and Republican circles by pushing for theSoviet Union to be integrated into the new international framework. The TreasuryDepartment’s financial wizard saw this postwar partnership with the SovietUnion—a nation with vast markets and resources—as a potentially enormous boonfor the U.S. economy, which he feared could slip back into depression after thewartime stimulus disappeared. White also saw this East-West financialpartnership as a way to continue the wartime alliance with Moscow and to ensureworld peace, a goal that President Roosevelt had made clear was a priority.By 1948, the visionary internationalism of the Roosevelt years was being rapidlyreplaced by the hardening nationalism of the Truman presidency. Men like HarryWhite had been driven from Washington, but he still served as a consultant tothe IMF and he was still widely respected throughout the world. And White stillhad detailed, inside knowledge from his years as Morgenthau’s top aide about thewartime activities of the Dulles group.If the political winds had been blowing in a different direction in 1948, itmight well have been men like Foster and Allen Dulles, Thomas McKittrick of BIS,and Walter Teagle and William Stamps Farish of Standard Oil instead of NewDealers like Hiss and White who were put under the investigative spotlight fortreason. But by turning the table on New Deal officials such as White, who hadlong wanted to prosecute these high-level Nazi collaborators, the Dulles groupensured their own legal protection. By seizing the investigative momentum,Republicans like Dick Nixon, whom Loftus called “Allen Dulles’s mouthpiece inCongress,” made sure that the Dulles circle would never have to answer for theirwartime actions.By the time Harry Dexter White walked into the packed hearing room on themorning of August 13, he had been under FBI investigation for seven months. J.Edgar Hoover’s agents had tapped his phones and conducted scores of interviewsin a determined effort to find evidence that he was a Russian spy. White’s twoprincipal accusers were Chambers and an emotionally unstable alcoholic namedElizabeth Bentley, who had taken Chambers’s place as a Soviet spy courier inwartime Washington after he fled the Communist Party in 1938. HUAC made Bentley,who appeared in front of the committee two weeks before White, one of its starwitnesses. Earlier, she had told the FBI that White was not a “card-carryingCommunist,” but when she stepped in front of the dazzling newsreel lights, herstory grew more dramatic. White was no longer simply a “misguided idealist” buta central player in the Nathan Silvermaster spy ring, feeding confidentialinformation to the group and using his influence to place Communist “contacts”in key government positions.Bentley, however, proved a highly problematic witness for HUAC. The former spyadmitted she had never met White, and over time, as her alcoholism grew worse,she became an increasingly erratic “expert”—as the committee billed her—onCommunist Party machinations. As her life spun out of control, Bentleyblackmailed the FBI into putting her on its payroll. She would remain a deeplytroubled ward of the bureau for the rest of her life, a witness-for-hire whomgovernment investigators would drag into the spotlight in between blackouts, carwrecks, and tumultuous lovers’ quarrels. Instead of the glamorous “red spyqueen” of the tabloid media’s dreams, the matronly, weak-chinned Bentley grew tobecome a pathetic symbol of Cold War exhibitionism.When Chambers testified about White before HUAC, he was more circumspect thanBentley. He claimed that he had met with White from time to time as a Sovietcourier, but he conceded that the Treasury economist was always cautious andnever gave him government documents. “I cannot say he was a Communist,” hetestified. In fact, Chambers seemed not to know what to make of White. “Hismotives always baffled me,” he wrote in his memoir.Nixon and his fellow HUAC members knew that their case against White was weak.Earlier in the year, the former Treasury official had already made a successfulappearance before a federal grand jury in New York that was investigatinggovernment subversion. The jury, which would later bring charges against Hiss,found insufficient evidence to indict White. And despite the FBI’s obsessivesurveillance of White, even Hoover’s intimate colleague Clyde Tolsonacknowledged that there was simply not enough proof to label him a “Sovietespionage agent” and warned that FBI officials were “making a great mistake inusing this phraseology.”In his appearance before HUAC, White conducted himself with dignity andeloquence. The committee’s badgering style often brought out the worst inwitnesses, with many resorting to obfuscating tactics or outraged histrionics,and others cowering cravenly and surrendering all that was asked of them,including their self-respect. But White responded to the committee’s questionshead-on, and when he felt compelled to enlighten his inquisitors onconstitutional principles and the fundamentals of the American legal system, hedid so with a respectful, professorial calm. White began his testimony by firmlydenying that he had ever been a Communist, explaining that he adhered instead toa set of beliefs that he called “the American creed.”I believe in freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of thought, freedomof the press, freedom of criticism, and freedom of movement. I believe in thegoal of equal opportunity, and the right of each individual to follow thecalling of his or her own choice, and the right of every individual to anopportunity to develop his or her capacity to the fullest.I believe in the right and duty of every citizen to work for, to expect, and toobtain an increasing measure of political, economic, and emotional security forall. I am opposed to discrimination in any form, whether on the grounds of race,color, religion, political belief or economic status.I believe in the freedom of choice of one’s representatives in government,untrammeled by machine guns, secret police, or a police state. I am opposed toarbitrary and unwarranted use of power or authority from whatever source oragainst any individual or group. I believe in the government of law, not of men.. . .I consider these principles sacred. I regard them as the basic fabric of ourAmerican way of life, and I believe in them as living realities, and not as merewords on paper. . . .“That is my creed. Those are the principles that I have worked for. Those arethe principles that I have been prepared in the past to fight for,” concludedWhite, who had enlisted in the Army during World War I, “and am prepared todefend at any time with my life, if need be.”White’s statement, a ringing invocation of the embattled New Deal philosophythat was in full retreat in Washington, evoked a loud and sustained round ofapplause from the audience. The former FDR official’s performance was soself-assured that committee members lunged at ways to rattle him. HUAC chairmanJ. Parnell Thomas, a New Jersey Republican who sought to ride the investigationto political glory but instead ended his career in prison for corruption, aimeda particularly low blow at White.For a number of years, the economist had been grappling with a serious heartcondition. The FBI had been forced to delay its interrogation of White theprevious year, after he suffered a heart attack. Before his HUAC appearance, heinformed the committee of his medical history in a confidential letter. But whenWhite began speaking about his connection with Nathan Silvermaster, explainingthat it was a harmless relationship that consisted of such recreationalactivities as playing Ping-Pong in the accused spy’s basement, Thomas shockedthe room by interjecting a comment about White’s illness. “For a person who hada severe heart condition, you certainly can play a lot of sports,” sneeredThomas. It was a typically ugly moment for the HUAC chairman, and when Whitereplied with gentlemanly restraint, pointing out that his athletic days were farbehind him, the audience again burst into applause.Nixon also got into a losing sparring match with White, clashing with thewitness over whether or not the HUAC hearings were “star-chamber proceedings.”The congressman insisted that they did not meet that definition because theywere open to the public. But White pointed out that by denying alleged“subversives” the right to confront and cross-examine their accusers, HUACveered dangerously close to operating as a royal tribunal. “Congressman,” Whitepatiently explained, “I am sure you appreciate that you need to balance the needfor conducting a hearing of this kind against the dangers of doing irreparableharm to some innocent persons. That is a patient heritage which Americans have,that a man is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty . . . and certainlyyou would be the first to recognize that, in order for a man to have a fairtrial, it requires all the rules and regulations of a court hearing.”Nixon, who had acknowledged that he was locking horns with a “rather notedscholar,” a man who held degrees from Columbia, Stanford, and Harvard, couldonly bow in agreement. “You are absolutely correct,” he told White.The only committee member who found a weakness in White’s story that morning wasJohn McDowell, a Pennsylvania Republican, who suggested that the former Treasuryofficial had kept some suspicious company when he served in the Rooseveltadministration. Several of the men whom he called “good friends,” includingSilvermaster, were accused spies, McDowell pointed out. “In case we proved thatthese men are all part of an espionage ring, your place in history is going tobe changed considerably, would you not think?” It proved to be a propheticremark, since, after his death, White would indeed be widely condemned as a spy,a conclusion that was based largely on guilt by association.White was certainly not entirely blameless. As the smartest man in SecretaryMorgenthau’s inner council, he had sometimes operated in the Washington arenawith a reckless arrogance. He was dismissive of bureaucratic protocols and sawnothing wrong with pursuing his own diplomatic initiatives with the Soviets. AsWhite’s biographer, R. Bruce Craig, would conclude, he probably was guilty of “aspecies of espionage,” but a fairly benign one. There is no evidence that Whitehanded over classified documents or subverted U.S. policy to correspond with theSoviet line. But he was guilty of frequent indiscretion when discussing policyissues with Soviet officials or with his left-wing friends and colleagues.To White this boldness was all in service to a higher good—his dream of aharmonious global financial order. White felt that his communications with theSoviet camp were not only in line with American interests but were in keepingwith the sentiments of his bosses, Morgenthau and FDR. By pursuing thisdialogue, he believed he could help rope the Soviets into Roosevelt’s new worldorder. But White knew that he was taking a risk, and when the political mood inWashington shifted after FDR’s death, he suddenly seemed not merely idealisticbut dangerous.White claimed not to know the political affiliations of the men he helped bringinto the federal government, yet he certainly must have known that some wereclose to the Communist Party if not actual members. To White, what mattered wasthat they were talented economists who brought impressive skills to government.The fact that most of them were, like him, products of eastern European Jewishfamilies, who had worked hard to climb the academic and professional ladderswhile maintaining a strong sense of public service, only reinforced the bondsthat he felt with them.Despite the committee’s insistence that he disown former colleagues such asSilvermaster, White refused to do so. “You cannot erase seven or eight years offriendship with a man that way unless I see evidence, unless the court declareshe is [guilty]—and until they prove he is guilty, I believe he is innocent.” Itwas one final, heartfelt declaration of principle from White, and it broughtforth yet another eruption from the crowd. White, at pains to avoid comingacross as a grandstander, apologized to Thomas. “I am sorry, Mr. Chairman, thisapplause is not my fault.”After concluding his testimony, White left Capitol Hill for Union Station, wherehe boarded a train for New Hampshire. He and his wife had recently bought a farmthere, known as Blueberry Hill, and he looked forward to some much-neededrelaxation after the relentless stress of the FBI, grand jury, and HUACinvestigations. On board the train, White felt chest pains, but when he arrivedat the local station he insisted on continuing on to his remote farm, which layat the end of a three-mile dirt road. The following day, August 14, he suffereda massive heart attack. Two physicians were summoned, but they declared thepatient beyond their medical powers. Two days later, Harry Dexter White died athome, surrounded by his family.For many, White seemed to be the victim of HUAC’s “special sort of tyranny,” inthe words of one partisan reporter. An unusually passionate editorial in The NewYork Times condemned the committee for its coarse handling of White. HUAC couldnot be blamed for his heart disease, stated the editorial, but it couldcertainly be charged with having “aggravated” his condition by putting himthrough an investigative “ordeal” without “the due protection of laws. . . .This procedure is not the American way of doing things. It is the un-Americanway.” But Nixon appeared unfazed by the press furor, moving quickly forward withhis inquisition of Hiss—who, after White’s passing, would serve as the next bestemblem of Rooseveltian treachery.Harry Dexter White’s death signified the final collapse of Washington’s New Dealorder and the unique brand of utopian internationalism that he had championed.It was men like Nixon and Dulles who now moved into the vacuum.By 1952, Richard Nixon’s triumph as a Cold War inquisitor had won him thenumber-two spot on the Republican presidential ticket headed by war hero DwightD. Eisenhower. But on September 29, Drew Pearson, Washington’s leadingmuckraker, dropped a bombshell on Nixon—one of his favorite targets—that brieflythreatened to end his political career. The story was part of a larger theme ofcorruption that reporters like Pearson believed hovered over Nixon’s career.Nixon, the humble son of Whittier, always seemed hungry for ways to profit fromhis public service.Earlier in the race, Pearson had discovered that Nixon’s wealthy SouthernCalifornia supporters had set up a slush fund for the politician’s personaluse—a revelation that had nearly forced the vice presidential candidate toresign as Eisenhower’s running mate. It took Nixon’s brilliantly homespun TVaddress to the nation—which would go down in history as the “Checkers speech”after the black-and-white cocker spaniel that had been given to Nixon’sdaughters by a supporter—to preempt the budding scandal and save his politicalcareer. “And you know, the kids love the dog,” Nixon told the largest audiencethat had ever tuned in for a political speech. “And I just want to say thisright now, that regardless of what they say about it, we’re going to keep it.”His shameless performance managed to transform a case of blatant politicalcorruption into a domestic drama that touched the hearts of millions ofAmericans.Nixon’s enormous relief was shared by the GOP power brokers who had picked himfor the race. It was the Dulles-Dewey group that had tapped Nixon for vicepresident. Their decision was conveyed to Eisenhower by Herbert Brownell Jr., afellow Wall Street attorney who had taken a leave from his blue-chip firm to runthe Republican campaign for the White House. The GOP brain trust convinced theaging general that the young senator from California not only brought regionalbalance to the ticket but the kind of slashing energy and anti-Communist fervorthat the campaign needed.But now, in the final weeks of the presidential contest, Pearson was again onthe verge of blowing up Nixon’s career. Reporting in his widely syndicatedWashington Merry-Go-Round column, Pearson revealed that the vice presidentialcandidate had left out something very important from his Checkers speech:namely, his crooked relationship with a Romanian industrialist named NicolaeMalaxa. The wealthy Romanian émigré had collaborated with the Nazis during thewar, and later with the Communist regime that took over his homeland. ButMalaxa’s reputation, Pearson reported, did not discredit him with Senator Nixon,who pulled strings on his behalf to allow him to continue living in the UnitedStates and to procure a major tax break for him.Pearson knew that Nixon had performed these favors for Malaxa in return for animpressive bribe. But, lacking the documentary evidence, the columnist had toleave this crucial piece of evidence out of his story.There was indeed a smoking gun: a $100,000 check from Malaxa deposited inNixon’s Whittier bank account. But Pearson was unable to get his hands on it. Ina twist of bad luck for Nixon, one of the tellers at his bank branch turned outto be a Romanian refugee who loathed Malaxa. He sent a photostatic copy of thecheck to political rivals of the notorious industrialist in the exile community,who in turn forwarded the copied check to their contact in the CIA, GordonMason, chief of the agency’s Balkans desk.By fall 1952, Allen Dulles was the number two man at the CIA and was in line totake over the agency with an Eisenhower-Nixon victory in November. As deputydirector, Dulles was already making the agency his own, working with loyalassociates like Frank Wisner—who would soon take over the agency’s action arm—onways to escalate the covert war against the Eastern bloc. But the ambitiousplans that Dulles and Wisner were hatching for a long-awaited Republicanpresidency suddenly seemed in peril when Gordon Mason walked into Wisner’soffice with a copy of the Malaxa check. “Jesus Christ!” Wisner burst out. “We’dbetter see Allen Dulles.”As he had long demonstrated, Frank Wisner was quite willing to recruit fromamong the ranks of ex-fascists for his espionage operations in EasternEurope—many of whom he had slipped past immigration authorities into the UnitedStates despite their barbaric wartime records. But Wisner, somewhatmysteriously, had insisted on drawing the line with Nicolae Malaxa, whom heconsidered a particularly “unsavory” character. In a March 1951 CIA memo, Wisnerhad even urged that Malaxa—who had finagled his way into the United States afterthe war as part of a Romanian trade delegation—be deported. Wisner had served asthe OSS station chief in Romania, and he considered the country his turf. He wasacutely sensitive to the factions and feuds within the Romanian exile community,where Malaxa provoked feelings passionate enough to tear apart all hope of aunited anti-Soviet front.Despite Wisner’s feelings about Malaxa, he realized that Allen Dulles was deeplyimplicated in the Romanian’s “unsavory” story. Dulles had not only been Malaxa’slawyer, he had introduced him to Nixon. The Malaxa money trail, in fact, led inmany compromising directions, including Nixon’s bank account, Dulles’s law firm,CIA front organizations like the National Committee for a Free Europe, and evensome of Wisner’s own secret combat groups. The Romanian industrialist, whoreportedly stashed away as much as $500 million (worth over $6.5 billion today)in overseas accounts before he fled to the United States, had made himselfextremely useful as a shadow financier for the underground Cold War.Malaxa was the type of charming scoundrel with whom Dulles enjoyed doingbusiness. The Romanian oligarch had no ideology; he believed only inopportunity. He had a witty sense of humor and the dark good looks of a dashingwerewolf, with thick black hair and a pronounced widow’s peak. He conductedhimself with a cynical, Mittel-European confidence that everyone had a price,greasing his way through life by smoothly slipping cash to all the right people.Bribery came so naturally to Malaxa that he once tried to buy off the dedicatedU.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service prosecutor who was handling hiscase—a man who, to Malaxa’s great surprise, turned out to be incorruptible.He began his career in modest fashion, as a locomotive repairman, but he had atalent for making connections and opening doors, and soon he amassed a smallfortune as a manufacturer of railroad equipment. In the 1920s, he and his familymoved into a mansion in Bucharest, where he entertained the capital’s highsociety, and befriended the mistress of King Carol II, Madame Magda Lupescu. Ina deft, Game of Thrones–like move, he cemented his royal connections byarranging for his own daughter to become the mistress of the king’s son, PrinceMichael. By forging a partnership with the king, who proved equally avaricious,Malaxa became a dominant player in the country’s steel, munitions, and oilindustries.In the 1930s, as Hitler built his war machine in Germany, King Carol’s rule cameunder increasing pressure from a homegrown fascist movement known as the IronGuard. The virulently anti-Semitic organization blamed Jews for Romania’s woesand targeted prominent Jewish figures such as Madame Lupescu. Despite the debthe owed the king’s mistress for her patronage, the ever-opportunistic Malaxabegan currying favor with the Iron Guard as the group grew more powerful,financing its activities and flying its flag from the roof of his stone mansion.In September 1940, the Iron Guard forced King Carol to abdicate and a pro-Germanfascist government took power in Bucharest. With Hitler’s influence expanding inRomania, Malaxa made another nimble move, merging his industrial empire withthat of Herman Goering’s brother Albert. “Your interests, my dear Mr. Malaxa,are the same as ours,” the Nazi industrialist warmly assured him.In January 1941, Malaxa’s green-uniformed Iron Guard thugs, feeling betrayed byRomania’s new fascist government, launched a coup attempt, using theindustrialist’s mansion as a base for their assault. During the coup, the IronGuard fell upon the country’s Jews in one of the most horrific spasms ofviolence in Romania’s history. Thousands of Jews in Bucharest were rounded upand beaten and tortured, including one group of more than a hundred—among themchildren as young as five—who were marched into a municipal slaughterhouse andbutchered. The Iron Guardsmen hung their victims, some still alive, on meathooks and “mutilated them in a vicious parody of kosher slaughtering practices,”according to one later account. The Iron Guard’s Bucharest pogrom was sodepraved that it shocked even the country’s fascist regime, which appealed toHitler to help put down the uprising.After the coup was suppressed, Malaxa was jailed as a leader of the conspiracyand his industrial empire was confiscated by the Nazis and the Romaniangovernment. But, in 1944, as the advancing Soviet army drove the Germans out ofRomania, Malaxa again rose from the ashes, insinuating himself into the newMoscow-backed regime. He was the only Romanian capitalist to whom the Communistgovernment returned his industrial property.Nevertheless, Malaxa was savvy enough to realize that his future was not brightin a Communist Romania. He had already taken the precaution of salting away muchof his huge fortune in U.S. accounts. After the war, by making a generousdistribution of bribes—including jewels, Cadillacs, and cash—Malaxa persuadedRomanian officials to allow him to travel to the United States, ostensibly ontrade business for the country. He arrived in 1946 and never returned home.Malaxa wisely chose to apply for permanent residency, instead of Americancitizenship, knowing the process was not as demanding. But his résumé was soeyebrow raising that his battle to stay in the United States would drag on foryears. Malaxa’s OSS, CIA, FBI, and INS files bulged with condemnations of hismorally dexterous, shape-shifting life. One government report labeled him“notorious.” Another called him “the most perfidious man in Romania.” He was a“master of the art of bribery” who had ushered in an “era of corruption” inRomania. He was a flagrant “opportunist” who “had been on all sides of the fenceat various times.” He had gone from playing “Hitler’s game” to someone who “mustbe considered an agent of the Soviet government and of the Romanian Communistsin the United States, even if he himself is not a Communist at heart.”According to a 1952 CIA memo, “perhaps the most concise appraisal of Malaxa”came from an American diplomat who found him “entirely unscrupulous, turningwith the wind, and like a cat [he] has developed to a high art the knack oflanding on his feet. He is considered to be essentially a dangerous type ofman.”None of this mattered to Allen Dulles when Malaxa turned up at his office atSullivan and Cromwell. The pertinent fact was that the Romanian had a hugefortune, and he was willing to spend millions of it where Dulles wanted him to.In return for financing Dulles’s far-flung anti-Communist network—whichstretched from Buenos Aires to Bucharest—Malaxa secured Dulles’s influentialhelp in his battle to stay in the United States. Some of Malaxa’s treasure wentto prominent Romanian exile leaders who hoped to take power after the Communistregime was toppled. Other funds went to Juan Perón’s Argentina, where Malaxa wasinvolved in a rising neofascist movement, and France, where he underwrote“scholarships” for exiled Romanian “students” who turned out to be veterans ofthe vicious Iron Guard.By 1948, Malaxa was ensconced in a luxurious apartment on Manhattan’s FifthAvenue, but his wheeling and dealing had begun to attract unwanted pressattention. In May, gossip columnist Walter Winchell exposed the notoriouscollaborator who was freely enjoying the city’s pleasures—the “Balkanazi onBroadway,” he called Malaxa. Winchell noted that the “distinguished” firm ofSullivan and Cromwell had recently dropped the Romanian as a client, presumablybecause he had grown too hot.But Dulles did not abandon Malaxa; behind the scenes, he entrusted theRomanian’s immigration battle to his political protégé Nixon. In return forMalaxa’s substantial gift of $100,000, the California senator began vigorouslylobbying INS officials on his behalf and pushing an immigration bill throughCongress that was designed to win Malaxa U.S. residency. When those effortsstalled due to determined resistance from legislators who were repelled by theémigré’s past, Malaxa and Nixon tried a different tack. With the help of Nixoncronies in Southern California, Malaxa announced that he was setting up apipeline factory in Whittier that he called the Western Tube Corporation. Nixonwrote a letter to the Defense Production Administration, claiming that Malaxa’sproject was “strategically and economically important, for both California andthe entire United States.” The Western Tube factory was never built, but thephantom project succeeded in winning Malaxa a huge tax windfall. And it keptalive the Romanian’s immigration campaign. California congressman John Shelleylater denounced the Western Tube affair as “a complete fraud, a springboard for[Malaxa’s] entry to the United States.”As the smoldering Malaxa scandal threatened to erupt into flames in the finaldays of the 1952 presidential race, Dulles moved quickly to douse it. AfterWisner and Mason showed him Malaxa’s $100,000 check, the deputy CIA directorknew that he would have to send it up the chain of command to his boss, GeneralWalter Bedell Smith. But Dulles also realized that, in this case, passing thebuck was as good as destroying the evidence. CIA director “Beetle” Smith hadserved as Eisenhower’s intensely dedicated chief of staff during the war, and hewas just as devoted to Ike’s presidential victory as Dulles.It was Gordon Mason who was given the unpleasant task of showing the evidence ofNixon’s corruption to General Smith, who predictably flew into a rage. “Smithwas a man who could cuss in three languages and in almost every sentence,”recalled Mason. “He also had a violent temper, and he acted as though Ipersonally was trying to scuttle Eisenhower.” Smith demanded that Masonimmediately gather up every scrap of incriminating material against Nixon andbring it to his office. “The story was cleaned from the books,” said Mason.Wisner, too, had no doubt what was done with the evidence. “Beetle just flushedit all down the toilet.”Without a copy of the Malaxa check, Drew Pearson could not keep the story going,and it soon petered out. On Election Day, Eisenhower and Nixon swept to adecisive victory, winning 55 percent of the vote and carrying thirty-nine of theforty-eight states.After the Republican triumph, Dulles and Nixon were finally able to speedMalaxa’s immigration case through the bureaucracy. In December 1953, officialsin Eisenhower’s Justice Department bypassed Congress and the INS and grantedMalaxa permanent residence through an administrative decree. Justice Departmentofficials explained that they had reached their decision due to the uniquetechnical services provided by the Western Tube Corporation. The fact thatMalaxa’s company did not actually exist—and never would—was politely overlookedby the new administration.Nicolae Malaxa lived out the rest of his days in the comfort of his Fifth Avenueapartment. He began to fancy himself a great benefactor. In January 1953,shortly before Eisenhower’s inauguration, Malaxa reached out the hand offriendship to a prominent Jewish exile named Iancu Zissu. Malaxa sent word thathe was eager to meet with Zissu, who was the cofounder of a Romanian exilegroup. The odd meeting took place in the New York apartment of a popularRomanian singer. According to one witness, “Malaxa told Zissu that he had wantedfor some time to know him because he is a great friend of the Jews and a greatadmirer of the Jewish religion. Malaxa stated that if he could change his ownreligion, he would adopt the Jewish faith.”As he bid Zissu farewell, Malaxa “assured him that those who had been hisfriends had never had reasons to regret it.” It was a surprising burst ofgoodwill—or, more likely, another attempt by the wily millionaire to buypolitical support.From the financial patron of Iron Guard butchers to “great friend of theJews”—it was just one more grotesque twist in a life filled with them."},{"pageContent":"9 [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-23]THE POWER ELITE [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-23]For the Dulles brothers, the Eisenhower-Nixon victory was the culmination ofyears of political strategizing dating back to the Roosevelt era. They had comeachingly close to achieving their dreams in the 1948 election, only to see theirlongtime ally Tom Dewey lose in the most shocking upset in American history. Butnow they were headed for the very center of Washington power. As the new headsof the State Department and the CIA, they would direct the global operations ofthe most powerful nation in the world. The fraternal partnership gave the Dullesbrothers a unique leverage over the incoming administration, and they wereimbued with a deep sense of confidence that these were the roles they weredestined to play.The 1952 presidential election represented the triumph of “the power elite,” inthe phrase coined by sociologist C. Wright Mills, academia’s most trenchantobserver of Cold War America. Mills was a ruggedly independent, Texas-bornscholar. He lived in a farmhouse forty miles outside of New York City and rode amotorcycle that he had built with his own hands to the classes he taught atColumbia University. He favored flannel shirts and work boots, and confided tofriends that “way down deep and systematically I’m a goddamned anarchist.” Millsrejected both the tired Marxist discourse that had dominated New Yorkintellectual circles since the 1930s and the “romantic pluralism” thatcharacterized conventional theories about American politics. According to Mills,power in America was not solely in the hands of Marx’s “ruling class”—those whoowned the means of production. Nor was it a balancing act of competinginterests, such as big business, organized labor, farmers, and professionalgroups. This ebb-and-flow concept of power—which was clung to by liberal andconservative scholars alike—was a “fairy tale,” in Mills’s words, one that was“not adequate even as an approximate model of how the American system of powerworks.”Instead, Mills wrote in his 1956 masterpiece The Power Elite, America was ruledby those who control the “strategic command posts” of society—the bigcorporations, the machinery of the state, and the military establishment. Thesedominant cliques were drawn together by their deep mutual stake in the“permanent war economy” that had emerged during the Cold War. Though politicaltensions could flare within the power elite, Mills wrote, there was a remarkableunity of purpose among these ruling groups. The top corporate executives,government leaders, and high-ranking military officers moved fluidly in and outof one another’s worlds, exchanging official roles, socializing in the sameclubs, and educating their children at the same exclusive schools. Mills calledthis professional and social synchronicity “the fraternity of the successful.”Within this system of American power, Mills saw corporate chiefs as the firstamong equals. Long interlocked with the federal government, corporate leaderscame to dominate the “political directorate” during World War II. The UnitedStates had largely become a democracy in form only. More than half of a centurybefore the John Roberts–era Supreme Court that legally sanctioned corporatecontrol of the electoral process, Mills recognized that the shift towardoligarchy was already well under way: “The long-time tendency of business andgovernment to become more intricately and deeply involved with each other has[now] reached a new point of explicitness. The two cannot now be seen clearly astwo distinct worlds.”The crucial task of unifying the power elite, according to Mills, fell to aspecial subset of the corporate hierarchy—top Wall Street lawyers and investmentbankers. These men were the “in-between types” who shuttled smoothly betweenManhattan corporate suites and Washington command posts. Little known to thegeneral public, these skilled executors of power constituted in Mills’s wordsAmerica’s “invisible elite.” They were the men who forged the consensus on keydecisions of national significance and who made certain that these decisionswere properly implemented. Their work was largely unseen and vaguely understood,but it had enormous impact on the lives of ordinary men and women. It was menlike John Foster Dulles and Allen Dulles whom Mills had in mind when he wrote ofthe power elite’s inner core.Born in Waco to an insurance salesman and a housewife and educated at theUniversity of Texas and the University of Wisconsin, Mills was steeped in anative populism rather than the European ideologies of the New Yorkintelligentsia. A big, broad man with an endless appetite for argument, he coulddebate for hours on end with the likes of Dwight Macdonald and Irving Howe. Buthe eschewed the hothouse sectarianism of the New York left, as well as thecompulsory mood of “American celebration” that had been embraced by nearly allof his intellectual colleagues in the Eisenhower years, searching instead for anew language to explain the American colossus that had emerged in the postwarera. Mills took aim at the most important topics in American society: thesoul-killing, “cheerfully robotic” regimentation of corporate life; the uniqueterrors of the nuclear age—an age, he argued, when war itself had become theenemy, not the Russians; and, of course, the overworld of American power, arealm that he believed few average citizens could grasp, even though it cast along shadow over their daily existence.“Take it big!” the intellectually ambitious Mills liked to exclaim. He wrote ina vigorous, clear style that rejected the academic caste’s “bloated puffery ofGrand Theory,” in sociologist Todd Gitlin’s words. Soon after The Power Elitewas published, it began stirring wide debate, catapulting over the ivy-coveredwalls of academia onto the bestseller list.Writing in The New York Times Book Review, corporate lawyer and presidentialadviser Adolf Berle—a member in good standing of the power elite—found “anuncomfortable degree of truth” in Mills’s book but fought off his discomfort byconcluding that it was essentially “an angry cartoon, not a serious picture.”Mills also struck a sensitive nerve with Cold War liberals like ArthurSchlesinger Jr., whom he accused of abandoning their intellectual independenceby joining the era’s American celebration. Schlesinger fired back, charging thatMills’s book seemed more intent on stirring the masses than on stimulatingserious academic debate. “I look forward to the time when Mr. Mills hands backhis prophet’s robes and settles down to being a sociologist again,” he wrote inthe New York Post.Mills considered himself an intellectual loner—“I am a politician without aparty,” he wrote in a letter. But The Power Elite touched a deep chord with arising new generation of revolutionaries and radicals that was soon to make itsimpact on history. Young Fidel Castro and Che Guevara pored over the book in theSierra Maestra mountains. And, at home, Tom Hayden drew heavily on Mills’swriting for the Port Huron Statement, the manifesto of the emerging New Left.By the time the Port Huron Statement was presented to the Students for aDemocratic Society convention in June 1962, C. Wright Mills was dead—felled by aheart attack in March of that year, at age forty-five. But his critique of thepower elite—and his sense of its fundamental, undemocratic illegitimacy—wouldcontinue to heavily influence the 1960s generation. Six years after his death,in the wake of the global youth uprisings of 1968, the CIA continued to identifyhim as one of the leading intellectual threats to the established order.Schlesinger was partly right about Mills. Though he was a rigorous researcherand a careful craftsman, The Power Elite did indeed resound here and there witha prophet’s moral urgency. Mills, who was deeply concerned about the runawaynuclear arms race of the Eisenhower era, knew that America’s rulers not onlypossessed terrifying instruments of violence, these men felt largelyunrestrained by democratic checks and balances. The ability of American leadersto end life on the planet imbued them with a dark power in Mills’s mind—one thatinspired impassioned passages like the concluding paragraph of The Power Elite:The men of the higher circles are not representative men; their high position isnot a result of moral virtue; their fabulous success is not firmly connectedwith meritorious ability. . . . They are not men shaped by nationallyresponsible parties that debate openly and clearly the issues this nation now sounintelligently confronts. They are not men held in responsible check by aplurality of voluntary associations which connect debating publics with thepinnacles of decision. Commanders of power unequaled in human history, they havesucceeded within the American system of organized irresponsibility.Men like the Dulles brothers rejoiced in such “organized irresponsibility.”Democracy, in their minds, was an impediment to the smooth functioning of thecorporate state. John Foster Dulles had made this clear early in his Wall Streetcareer as he jousted with FDR’s New Deal bureaucracy. Complaining to LordMcGowan, chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries, about government efforts tocontrol the spiraling power of global cartels, Foster once acidly remarked, “Thefact of the matter is that most of these politicians are highly insular andnationalistic . . . [so] business people . . . have had to find ways for gettingthrough and around stupid political barriers.” Allen, for his part, had gonethrough his espionage career with similar disdain for presidential directivesand “stupid political barriers.” As Richard Helms put it, with typically drollunderstatement, “There can be no question that Dulles felt most comfortablerunning things on his own with a minimum of supervision from above.”When Franklin Roosevelt moved into the White House in 1933, he was well aware ofthe entrenched interests that he would be confronting as he attempted to reformthe country’s financial system and to create a social buffer against the havocof the Depression. “The real truth,” FDR wrote to Colonel Edward M. House,President Wilson’s close adviser, “as you and I know, is that a financialelement in the larger centers has owned the Government ever since the days ofAndrew Jackson.” For a brief period during the widespread devastation of the1930s, the New Deal was able to challenge this “plutocracy,” as Roosevelt calledit. The Roosevelt presidency did not dismantle the power elite, Mills laterwrote, “but it did create within the political arena, as well as in thecorporate world itself, competing centers of power that challenged those of thecorporate directors.”But the militarization of government during World War II began to return powerto the corporate elite, as captains of industry and finance moved into keygovernment posts. The Eisenhower presidency would complete this politicalcounterreformation, as Washington was taken over by business executives, WallStreet lawyers, and investment bankers—and by a closely aligned warrior castethat had emerged into public prominence during World War II.During the Eisenhower administration, the Dulles brothers would finally be givenfull license to exercise their power in the global arena. In the name ofdefending the free world from Communist tyranny, they would impose an Americanreign on the world enforced by nuclear terror and cloak-and-dagger brutality.Elevated to the pinnacle of Washington power, they continued to forcefullyrepresent the interests of their corporate caste, conflating them with thenational interest.C. Wright Mills was among the first to take note of how “national security”could be invoked by the power elite to more deeply disguise its operations. TheDulles brothers would prove masters at exploiting the anxious state of permanentvigilance that accompanied the Cold War. “For the first time in Americanhistory, men in authority are talking about an ‘emergency’ without foreseeableend,” Mills wrote. “Such men as these are crackpot realists: in the name ofrealism they have constructed a paranoid reality all their own.”This chilling observation, which still has disturbing echoes today, captured thegloomy zeitgeist of the Eisenhower-Dulles era. It was a time of Americancelebration—of unprecedented prosperity and unparalleled military prowess—aswell as hair-trigger nuclear tensions. Only a few maverick voices—like that ofthe intellectual loner from Texas—grasped the frightening amorality thatprevailed at the pinnacle of American power.President Eisenhower enjoyed being in the company of wealthy and powerful men.He filled his administration with power players from theDewey-Dulles–Rockefeller-Luce–dominated New York nexus, as well as from thehigher rungs of industry and the Pentagon. Wall Street lawyer Herbert Brownellwas named attorney general after running Ike’s campaign, General Motors CEOCharles Wilson was tapped to run the Defense Department, and Chase Manhattanchairman and former diplomat John McCloy—the very personification of the powerelite—was called upon as a national security adviser. Even the Eisenhoweradministration’s second rung of power—the undersecretaries and deputieslevel—was weighted with men like Wall Street banker C. Douglas Dillon, anotherclose associate of the Dulles brothers. The exclusive ranks of the Council onForeign Relations, where the brothers had long held sway, was a particularlyfertile ground for administration recruiters.Ike also liked to spend his leisure time with the high and mighty. The avid“golfer-in-chief” often had prominent business executives and Army generals intow during his twice-weekly trips to the verdant links at Burning Tree CountryClub in Bethesda, including the CEOs of General Electric, Coca-Cola, ReynoldsTobacco, and Young & Rubicam.Merriman Smith, the longtime White House wire service reporter, defended Ike’sstrong affinity for the power elite: “It would be unfair to say that he likesthe company of kings of finance and industry purely because of their Dun andBradstreet ratings. He believes that if a man has worked up to become presidentof the Ford Motor Company [or] head of the Scripps-Howard newspapers . . . thencertainly the man has a lot on the ball, knows his field thoroughly and will beliterate and interesting.” To which one observer, quoted by Mills, mordantlyresponded: “This business of working your way up will come as quite a surpriseto young Henry Ford or young Jack Howard [the scion who inherited theScripps-Howard chain].”Eisenhower was comfortable in the company of these men because he shared theirconservative, business-oriented views. President Truman, who had helped pave thegeneral’s path to the White House by appointing him the first supreme commanderof NATO forces in 1951, tried to persuade Eisenhower to run for president as aDemocrat, promising that he would “guarantee” him his party’s nomination. ButEisenhower replied, “What reason have you to think I have ever been a Democrat?You know I have been a Republican all my life and that my family have alwaysbeen Republican.” When Truman persisted, Ike made it even more plain, tellinghim that his differences with the Democrats, particularly when it came to theparty’s pro-labor positions, were simply too immense for him to consider such acourse.Meanwhile, the Dewey-Dulles group’s courtship of Eisenhower to become theRepublican standard-bearer, which had begun two years earlier, was coming to asuccessful conclusion. Dewey had first broached the subject of a White House runat a private meeting with Eisenhower in July 1949, following the governor’s owntraumatic presidential defeat. Dewey had beseeched the reluctant general to jumpinto the political arena, telling him that he was the only man who could “savethis country from going to Hades in the handbasket of paternalism, socialism[and] dictatorship.”By early 1952, the Dulles brothers had come to agree that throwing their supportbehind the popular war hero was their best path to the White House. In May,Foster flew to France, meeting with the general twice at NATO headquarters inFontainebleau and urging him to run. The two men did not immediately hit it off.Foster was uncharacteristically diffident and uncertain in the presence of thelegendary warrior. Eisenhower, accustomed to crisp military briefings, foundFoster’s discursive and lawyerly monologues boring. Foster quickly wore out thegeneral’s patience, which he was in the habit of communicating by tapping out arestless drumbeat on his knee with a pencil and, when that failed to end theordeal, by gazing blankly at the ceiling and “signaling the end of all mentalcontact,” in the words of one aide. Foster later brought out the wicked wit inChurchill, who proclaimed him “Dull, Duller, Dulles.”But the foreign policy paper that Foster presented to Eisenhower in France wasfar from dull. The memo, which Foster appropriately titled “A Policy ofBoldness,” urged the next president to take a much sharper stand against theSoviet bloc than Truman, aiming to roll back Communism in Eastern Europe ratherthan simply containing it. Foster called for an escalation of the undergroundwar against Moscow that his brother was already operating, including a redoubledcommitment to psychological warfare. “We should be dynamic, we should use ideasas weapons, and these ideas should conform to moral principles. That we do thisis right, for it is the inevitable expression of a faith—and I am confident thatwe still do have a faith.” Foster’s paper had the italicized cadences of apreacher’s sermon; it was filled with the missionary fervor that had run forgenerations through his family.Foster was at his most zealous in his discussion of nuclear arms policy. Heproposed an unsettling shift in thinking about America’s fearsome nucleararsenal, moving away from the concept of doomsday weapons as an instrument oflast resort to one of first resort. The United States must reserve the right tomassively retaliate against any Soviet aggression in the world, wherever andwhenever it chose, he wrote. By making it clear to the world that Washington wasnot afraid to wield its nuclear arms as if they were conventional weapons ofwar, the United States would gain a commanding strategic advantage. It was thetype of leverage enjoyed by a heavily armed madman in a crowded room. But Fosterhad a more diplomatic way of expressing it. Weapons of mass destruction “in thehands of statesmen . . . could serve as effective political weapons in defenseof peace.”Foster further sweetened his argument by pointing out that a nuclear-basedmilitary strategy would help contain the growing costs of America’s “far-flung,extravagant” defense complex that was threatening to bankrupt the nation.Instead of maintaining an expensive troop presence at every global flashpoint,Foster wrote, all the United States had to do was keep a ready finger on itsnuclear trigger.Even master of war Eisenhower was initially taken aback by Foster’s proposal fora “first-use” nuclear strategy. After making his presentation to thenoncommittal general, Foster returned to his suite at the Ritz Hotel in Paris,where he frantically paced the room, telling a confidant that Eisenhower somehowfailed to grasp that the world was facing a dire Soviet threat. But Eisenhowerdid share Foster’s passionate anti-Communism. And the cost efficiencies of themassive retaliation strategy appealed to the budget-minded general, who wasequally concerned about the growing burden of military spending on the economy.So began the reign of nuclear terror—or “brinksmanship”—that would hold theworld in its grip for the next decade.Foster’s new “policy of boldness” became a centerpiece of Eisenhower’spresidential campaign, and the Wall Street lawyer was widely touted as the nextsecretary of state. Henry Luce helped enshrine Foster by running his foreignpolicy paper in Life magazine in May 1952. “No one has a broader bipartisanunderstanding of U.S. foreign policy than John Foster Dulles,” stated therespectful biography that accompanied the article.After Foster was duly confirmed as secretary of state in January 1953—a positionhe had long coveted and felt he was destined to hold—he addressed severalhundred foreign service employees gathered in front of the State Departmentbuilding in Foggy Bottom. The weather was uncomfortably cold, but thesixty-five-year-old Foster stood on the steps overlooking the crowd with asturdy self-confidence—a “solid tree trunk of a man,” in the words of onebiographer, “gnarled and weathered and durable.” He carried himself like someonewho owned the place. “I don’t suppose there is any family in the United States,”he told his assembled workforce, “which has been for so long identified with theForeign Service and the State Department as my own family.”Once installed at Foggy Bottom, Foster quickly took command of Eisenhower’sforeign policy, elbowing aside other experts in international affairs who soughtthe president’s ear. Sherman Adams, President Eisenhower’s chief of staff, foundthe new secretary of state a “tough-fibered individual . . . an aristocrat inhis own domain” who insisted on maintaining his own direct line to thepresident. Foster was “a rather secretive person,” Adams added, who assiduouslydeflected efforts by the White House staff to enter the tight loop he had builtwith the commander in chief. After their initial uneasiness with each other,Eisenhower ultimately decided that even though his secretary of state was “a bitsticky at first . . . he has a heart of gold when you know him.” Foster soon hadEisenhower “in his palm,” observed a State Department aide.Allen Dulles felt as firmly entitled to run the CIA under Eisenhower as hisbrother did the State Department. The junior Dulles had worked uncomplaininglyfor two years as Walter Bedell Smith’s deputy director at the agency, though hehad considerably more intelligence experience than “Beetle.” Dullesgood-naturedly put up with the crusty general’s foulmouthed explosions, with theexpectation that Smith would anoint him his successor. “The general was in fineform this morning, wasn’t he? Ha, ha, ha!” Dulles would chuckle, after returningto his office from what his CIA colleagues called one of Smith’s “fanny-chewingsessions.”During the 1952 presidential race, Dulles proved his loyalty to theEisenhower-Nixon campaign by channeling funds to the Republican ticket throughCIA front groups and by leaking embarrassing intelligence reports to the mediaabout the Truman administration’s handling of the Korean War—flagrant violationsof the CIA charter that forbids agency involvement in domestic politics.But even though Smith recruited Dulles for the agency and made him his deputy,he never warmed up to his number two man. “Beetle”—who, as Eisenhower’s formerwartime aide, enjoyed unique access to the president-elect—became an impedimentto Dulles’s CIA ascension following the Republican victory. “After two years ofclose personal observation,” wrote a CIA historian, “Smith lacked confidence inDulles’s self-restraint.” The general felt that Dulles was too enamored of thedark arts of the spy trade. Smith would tell friends that running the CIAsometimes made it necessary to leave his moral values outside the door. But, hequickly added, clinging to his soldierly code of conduct, “You’d damned wellbetter remember exactly where you left them.”Dulles struck Smith as a man who was all too blithe about abandoning hisscruples. The deputy CIA director had no qualms about advocating theassassination of foreign leaders, even presenting a plan to Smith in early 1952to kill Stalin at a Paris summit meeting. Smith firmly rejected the plan. Heshuddered at the thought of Dulles taking over the top spot at the agency.As Smith prepared to step down at the CIA, he lobbied against Dulles as hisreplacement, advising Eisenhower that it would be politically unwise to have thebrother of the secretary of state serve as the administration’s intelligencechief. Instead, Smith urged Eisenhower to select another one of his agencydeputies, Lyman Kirkpatrick. Like Dulles, Kirkpatrick was a product of Princetonand had an impressive espionage résumé dating back to the war—but, as his careerat the CIA would prove, he also had a well-tuned sense of proper conduct. (Yearslater, Kirkpatrick would be called upon to direct the internal investigation ofthe Bay of Pigs debacle that nearly ruined the agency, doing such an honest jobthat some CIA old boys, including Dulles himself, never forgave him.)Despite Beetle Smith’s close ties to Eisenhower, he found himself outmaneuveredby the Dulles brothers. Anticipating Smith’s objections, Foster got toEisenhower first and convinced him that having his brother in charge of the CIAwould actually be an asset, ensuring smooth cooperation in the running offoreign policy. When Smith began making his case against Dulles, Eisenhower cuthim off, telling his old friend that he had already talked to Foster, who saw noproblem at all with a fraternal reign of power.Smith had never really stood a chance of blocking Allen Dulles. Eisenhower wasdeeply beholden to the Wall Street Republican power brokers who had not onlyrecruited him for the presidential race but had helped finance his electoralbattle, loaned him one of their own—white-shoe lawyer Herbert Brownell Jr.—torun his campaign, and had even tapped Dick Nixon as his running mate. TheDewey-Dulles group was Ike’s brain trust and bank. When these men spoke, thegeneral listened.Under Allen Dulles, the CIA would become a vast kingdom, the most powerful andleast supervised agency in government. Dulles built his towering citadel withthe strong support of President Eisenhower, who, despite occasional misgivingsabout the spymaster’s unrestrained ways, consistently protected him from hisWashington enemies. As America extended its postwar reach around the world, withhundreds of military bases in dozens of countries and U.S. oil, mining,agribusiness, and manufacturing corporations operating on every continent,Eisenhower saw the CIA (along with the Pentagon’s nuclear firepower) as the mostcost-effective way to enforce American interests overseas. Presidentialhistorian Blanche Wiesen Cook, author of The Declassified Eisenhower, initiallyregarded Ike as “a presidential pacifist.” But after examining theadministration’s documentary evidence for her 1981 book, Cook arrived at theconclusion that “America’s most popular hero was America’s most covertpresident. Eisenhower participated in his own cover-up. His presidency involveda thorough and ambitious crusade marked by covert operations that depended onsecrecy for their success.”The rise of Dulles’s spy complex in the 1950s would further undermine a U.S.democracy that, as Mills observed, was already seriously compromised by growingcorporate power. The mechanisms of surveillance and control that Dulles put inmotion were more in keeping with an expanding empire than they were with avibrant democracy. As journalist David Halberstam later observed, “The nationalsecurity complex became, in the Eisenhower years, a fast-growing apparatus toallow us to do in secret what we could not do in the open. This was not just anisolated phenomenon but part of something larger going on in Washington—thetransition from an isolationist America to imperial colossus. A true democracyhad no need for a vast, secret security apparatus, but an imperial country did.. . . What was evolving was a closed state within an open state.”On a bright afternoon in September 1953, forty-three-year-old Senator JosephMcCarthy married his office aide, a twenty-nine-year-old former college beautyqueen named Jean Kerr, with great pomp and ceremony at St. Matthew’s Cathedralin Washington. Pope Pius XII bestowed his apostolic blessing on the couple, andtwelve hundred guests—including Vice President Nixon, CIA director Allen Dulles,and young senator John F. Kennedy, whose father was a strong McCarthysupporter—crowded into the cathedral for the nuptials. Afterward, McCarthy andhis new wife were whisked away by limousine to a celebrity-studded party heldamid the Beaux-Arts splendor of the Patterson Mansion on Dupont Circle, wherethe couple cut their towering wedding cake and prizefighter Jack Dempsey kissedthe bride. Feted by the capital’s political luminaries and Hollywood royalty,McCarthy stood at the pinnacle of his power on his wedding day. Packed into hismonkey suit and slugging champagne, the thick-built Washington heavyweight withthe dark-stubbled jaw had the champion swagger of Dempsey himself.The Republican senator had come a long way from the Wisconsin dairy farm wherehe had grown up. He had financed his political rise by taking payoffs fromPepsi-Cola bottlers and prefab construction moguls. In truth, he never lost histaste for the glitzy swag of politics. One of his wedding gifts, it wasreported, was a pink Cadillac Coupe de Ville presented to him by a Houstonbusinessman who shared his militant anti-Communism.By 1953, McCarthy’s anti-Red witch hunt was in full blaze, torching the careersof distinguished senators and statesmen and even beginning to flicker ominouslyoutside the White House itself. The FBI’s Hoover, long a powerful supporter, wasgrowing increasingly anxious about McCarthy’s inflamed ambitions. That summerHoover warned the new administration that he had learned there was a“conspiracy” to sabotage Eisenhower’s presidency and replace Ike with thehard-charging Wisconsin senator.The carnival of shame and humiliation that McCarthy brought to Washington heldthe capital in its grip from February 1950—when he delivered the infamous speechin Wheeling, West Virginia, that kicked off his inquisition (“I have in my handa list of names . . .”)—to December 1954, when the Senate finally voted tocensure him, triggering his rapid political and physical collapse. No one—fromthe loftiest general or cabinet member to the lowliest government clerk—wasimmune from Joe McCarthy’s suspicious gaze. When he ran out of alleged Communistsympathizers to drag before his Kafkaesque-sounding Senate PermanentSubcommittee on Investigations, he began prowling the halls of Washington insearch of closeted homosexuals—or “powder puffs,” as he liked to call them.The florid McCarthy pageant is a fascinating case study in the dynamics ofWashington power. The senator was a glaring outsider in the capital’s elitesalons—a crude, hard-drinking ex-marine. He seemed to defy the neat powercategories of C. Wright Mills, fueled more by the sort of ideological fervor,demagoguery, and murky sponsorship that would characterize the later Tea Partyera of American politics.McCarthy was not educated at Ivy League schools, and he was never courted byWall Street firms. He had worked his way through law school at MarquetteUniversity in Milwaukee by pumping gas and going door-to-door selling caulkingcompound for doors and windows. He liked to drink bourbon, and in 1952, when anoperation for a herniated diaphragm cut him open from gut to shoulder and lefthim in chronic pain, he drank harder still. Even after he was elected to theaugust U.S. Senate, he carried around a barroom bully’s sense of grievance. Heonce assaulted Drew Pearson in the cloakroom of the exclusive Sulgrave Club,pinning the muckraker’s arms behind him and kneeing him in the balls—viciouspayback for all the columns Pearson had written about McCarthy’s career. Andyet, backed in the beginning by Hoover’s investigative apparatus, as well as bythe Catholic Church and the right-wing Hearst and McCormick press, the thuggishsenator was able to turn his chairmanship of the previously obscure subcommitteeinto one of the capital’s most powerful perches. Washington’s VIPs hated andfeared him, but most paid homage to him.McCarthy was a monster of the Republican leadership’s own creation. By the timehe claimed the national spotlight in 1950, the GOP had long been using the darkincantations of “treason” and “un-Americanism” for political advantage againstthe Democrats. It was only a matter of time before a specter like McCarthy beganto rise up in this toxic atmosphere. Nixon had exploited these themes to greateffect in his congressional and Senate races, as did Tom Dewey—though with lesssuccess—in his 1948 presidential campaign. Despite Truman’s victory, he wasconstantly on the defensive against Republican charges that Communists werehoneycombed throughout the federal bureaucracy. In response, Truman imposed aloyalty test on federal employees and created an extensive surveillanceapparatus to go with it, which turned up few real security threats. He alsoshredded the Bill of Rights by unleashing a wave of prosecutions againstCommunist Party officials, thereby effectively outlawing the party anddemolishing much of the organized left. Realizing that he had crossed aconstitutional Rubicon, a troubled Truman wrote to Eleanor Roosevelt—the NewDeal’s aging but unbending icon—and insisted that he was not trying to set off awitch hunt. But that’s indeed what he did.As Eisenhower took over the White House in 1953, it was uncertain whether themost dynamic force in Washington would be the new president or the senator fromWisconsin. Eisenhower confided that he reviled McCarthy nearly as much as he hadHitler—but he kept pulling back from confronting him. When Ike had ventured intoMcCarthy’s home state during the 1952 campaign, making a whistle stop in GreenBay, the senator shared the platform with him. Before speaking to the crowd,Eisenhower leaned over to McCarthy and told him, “I’m going to say that Idisagree with you.” McCarthy looked the general squarely in the face: “If yousay that, you’ll be booed.” Eisenhower stood his ground. “I’ve been booedbefore.” But when it came time to speak, Eisenhower buckled, carefully smoothingover their differences.The GOP campaign in 1952 thoroughly embraced McCarthyism. Nixon took the leadingRepublican role as hatchet man so that Eisenhower could assume a more dignifiedposture; in September Nixon vowed to make the “Communist conspiracy” the “themeof every speech from now until election.” McCarthy, in turn, performed loyallyfor the party, putting his gutter techniques to use at the service of thecampaign. Democratic presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson, he declared in awidely broadcast speech in October, “would continue the suicidal Kremlin-shapedpolicies of this nation.” At one point McCarthy pretended to confuse Stevensonwith the accused traitor Hiss, calling him “Alger—I mean Adlai.”But after Eisenhower’s victory, McCarthy quickly made clear that he consideredthe new Republican administration fair game. The monster was loose and nobody inWashington was safe. Before the Dulles-dominated Eisenhower administration couldget on with its ambitious plans for running the world, it first had to securethe capital, where the dangerous senator continued to make strong men cower.During the first year of Eisenhower’s presidency, McCarthy would boldly targetthe three institutions at the very center of Washington’s global power: theState Department, the CIA, and finally the Army.The different ways these institutions grappled with the assaults from McCarthyshed a fascinating light on Washington’s pyramid of power—as well as on thedistinctive personalities of the Dulles brothers. It would become clear in thecourse of this labyrinthine power struggle just who wielded the biggest sword onthe Potomac.There was little doubt about who the big brother was in the Dulles family.Foster had carried himself with a grave sense of familial responsibility eversince he was a boy, while Allen felt free to pursue more mischievous pleasureswell into adulthood. Family members inevitably brought their requests andtroubles to Foster, not Allen—though the elder brother’s advice, as Eleanordiscovered, was not always sound. She once lost her savings on a bad investmentthat Foster advised her to make. Nonetheless, the Wall Street wise man projecteda sober wisdom; titans of industry paid close heed to his counsel, which hedispensed in a deliberative manner, confident that his every word was money.As the brothers assumed their positions in the Eisenhower government, theybrought with them a unique working chemistry, one that had been forged from thetime they shared tasks on their Lake Ontario fishing expeditions. Theirrelationship was not without its tensions and petty squabbles. Allen thought heactually should have been named secretary of state, since he had more experiencewith foreign affairs and had a more intricate network of overseas connections.He sometimes chafed under his older brother’s imperial rule.Foster seemed blithely unaware of Allen’s frustrations. “The thing that haspuzzled me a great deal is that I’m not sure how much Foster realized thissituation,” Eleanor observed years later, after the older brother was dead. “Ifhe realized it, he didn’t show it by any overcompensation or by anyoverconsideration. All his dealings with Allen were as if there was nopsychological essence or problem that had to be dealt with. They dealt with thesubject matter and not with each other as people with certain sensitivities andcertain prejudices, and so on.”But Eleanor, the psychologically acute sister, could feel Allen’s jealousy andcompetitiveness. “I felt it in Allen. I didn’t feel it in Foster. I think youcan imagine why. Foster did have more power and more experience, and,” she addedmatter of factly, “I think [Foster had] the better brain.”Allen was well aware of the Washington chatter about the unusual brother act.“Every once in a while we were teased, of course, as brothers are likely to bewhen each of them has a position of a certain amount of importance and areworking together,” he remarked in later years. “But I was very conscious of thedanger in that situation and I tried to avoid either appearances or actionswhich would justify any criticism on that score.”It was very important to Allen that people not think he got his CIA positionbecause of his brother. “You see,” he told an oral historian after his brother’sdeath, “I was in there before my brother became secretary of state. I was deputydirector [of the CIA]. . . . So then when Bedell Smith retired, it was more orless normal that I would be appointed. I mean, that was not considered aparticular show of nepotism on the part of Eisenhower. Personally, Eisenhowerand I were very close to each other. We’d gotten to know each other very well.Nobody, as far as I know—I’m sure Foster exercised no pressure at all—because itwas quite normal that I would take over that place.” But the truth is thatFoster did exert his influence on his brother’s behalf, and Eisenhower neverfelt close to the younger Dulles, regarding him as a necessary evil in hisshadow war with world Communism.Despite its underlying complexities, the Dulles brothers’ partnership provedvery effective. They conferred on a regular basis during their Washington reign.“Normally they saw each other once, twice, maybe three times a week. Allen usedto go to [Foster’s] house on Saturday and sit down and talk to him for two orthree hours,” recalled Eleanor, who—after Foster reluctantly agreed to give herthe State Department’s Bonn desk—sometimes joined her brothers at the spaciousstone house in a wooded neighborhood of Washington. “I know Foster valued theseconversations.”Unlike the gregarious Allen, Foster was somewhat of a loner. “I’m not sure thatthere are more than a half dozen people in Washington that he felt really athome with. Maybe a dozen,” said Eleanor. Allen was Foster’s essential link tothe Georgetown power circles where the spymaster easily circulated. He collectedvital gossip and inside information from his social outings, bringing it back tohis brother. Allen was the only frequent visitor that Eleanor ever saw inFoster’s home.It was Allen, the master of persuasion and seduction, who also expertly handledrelations with the press. He counted among his friends not only press baronssuch as Luce and New York Times publisher Arthur Hays Sulzberger and TV networkmoguls like William Paley of CBS, but also leading Washington pundits such asJoseph and Stewart Alsop. Allen enjoyed wining and dining the nation’s opinionmakers, while Foster would “almost rather negotiate with the Russians than bebothered by that,” in Eleanor’s estimation.The brothers sometimes clashed. David Atlee Phillips, a CIA counterintelligenceofficial whose career flourished under Allen Dulles, later recalled the timeFoster instructed his brother to arrange a secret CIA payment to a foreignpolitical candidate. After consulting with his operatives in the field, Alleninformed his brother that it was a bad idea. “The secretary of state, in crispterms, said he had not asked whether the idea was good or bad,” Phillipsrecounted, “but that he had instructed the CIA chief that it be done.” The cashwas duly delivered—and the candidate still lost (a fact noted by Phillips withevident satisfaction).On other occasions, Allen expressed his opposition to his brother in morevehement terms. He once told Foster that a speech he planned to deliver on theSoviet Union was “rotten” and he should scrap it. “I am the secretary of stateand it is my speech,” Foster insisted. “And I damned well will say it if I wantto.” But Allen would not back down. “My Soviet expert here says it is wrong. AndI won’t let you make a damned fool of yourself, secretary of state or not!”By and large, though, the Dulles fraternal partnership was a machine of hummingefficiency. “We didn’t realize in the early winter months of 1953 as the newadministration took shape just how cozy the Dulles brothers’ arrangement forhandling all American business abroad would be,” recalled veteran CIA officerJoseph Smith. “It came to mean very quickly that when a situation would notyield to normal diplomatic pressure, Allen’s boys were expected to step in andtake care of the matter.”Before business abroad could be addressed, however, there was some messiness athome that needed to be taken care of. Allen Dulles might have labored under theshadow of his more esteemed older brother through most of his career, but he wasabout to show Washington who was the tougher power player.As the Eisenhower presidency got under way in January 1953, the State Departmentwas the target of no less than ten separate, ongoing congressional probes byMcCarthy and his Capitol Hill confederates, who saw Foggy Bottom as a hotbed ofpansies, pointy-headed intellectuals, parlor room pinkos, and other soft typeswho were vulnerable to the siren song of Communism. In the beginning, Fosterthought McCarthy’s reign of terror could be useful. He was just as eager as theRepublican right wing to purge the State Department of all New Deal remnants.Foster, courting favor with party hard-liners, agreed to hire a security deputyto oversee the massive screening of all State Department employees. ScottMcLeod, the man he hired, was an ex-FBI agent and former reporter for theinfluential right-wing New Hampshire newspaper, the Manchester Union Leader.McLeod, who proudly displayed an autographed photo of McCarthy on his deskinscribed “To a Great American,” was the Wisconsin senator’s man inside theState Department. Like McCarthy, McLeod brought a cynical Irish beat cop’sattitude to the complex task of sorting out the beliefs and allegiances of theU.S. diplomatic corps. McLeod was “anti-intellectual, shrewd, conspiratorial,quick-tempered [and] vindictive,” as John Foster Dulles biographer TownsendHoopes later observed. A State Department colleague of McLeod put it moresympathetically: “Scotty lived in an essentially simple world.”As with the other paroxysms of paranoia that seized Washington during the ColdWar, McLeod’s witch hunt turned up very few genuinely worrisome suspects. Mostof its victims were highly competent, experienced members of the foreign servicewhose policy differences with the new Dulles regime simply rendered them“incompatibles,” in McLeod’s Orwellian term. A number of these purge victims,such as John Carter Vincent and John Paton Davies Jr., were veterans of theChina desk, where their only crime was infuriating the right-wing Taiwan lobbyby honestly evaluating why Communist revolutionary Mao Tse-tung had been able todefeat corrupt warlord Chiang Kai-shek. The civil service apparatus was supposedto protect respected officials like this, many of whom had made valuablecontributions to the U.S. government’s understanding of the world. But ideologytrumped ability in Foster’s intensely politicized State Department.Foster even forced out one of the brightest, most respected intellectual starsin the foreign service firmament, Soviet expert George F. Kennan, simply becausehe took exception to the secretary of state’s “liberation” strategy aimed atEastern Europe—a policy so dangerously unviable that even Eisenhower and theDulles brothers themselves would soon make clear that they had no intention offollowing through on this campaign promise to “roll back” the Iron Curtain.As McLeod’s quickly assembled battalion of some 350 inexperienced but gung hoinvestigators began snooping through State Department employee records, a cloudof fear settled over Foggy Bottom. Those whose files were tagged and sent overto McCarthy’s subcommittee knew their days in government were over—nobody whoendured the snide and relentless grilling at the hands of McCarthy and hisequally ruthless chief counsel, Roy Cohn, could expect their career to survive.By the time McCarthy’s Washington bonfires were extinguished two years later,the careers of several hundred State Department officers and employees lay inashes.Early in the McCarthy-McLeod inquisition, Foster realized that it could burn outof control. While he was happy to see political opponents consumed in itsflames, he soon grew worried that the State Department itself was at stake. Bysubjecting employees to humiliating loyalty tests and exposure of their privatelives, the wide-reaching security program was emptying the State Department ofits best and brightest.Even Eleanor Dulles, who was reluctant to confront her impregnablyself-confident brother, felt compelled to complain to him. After all, the StateDepartment was the family business, it had been entrusted to Foster—and now hewas allowing McCarthy to ruin it. Eleanor had seen the danger early on, when theEisenhower-Nixon campaign made its unsavory alliance with McCarthy. She firstconfronted Foster then. “I went over to New York. I called up Foster and said Iwas coming. He said, ‘Come to dinner.’ You know, he was generous and friendly inthat sort of thing, even if he was busy. He was very frank though, if he didn’twant you, he would tell you. . . . But I went to dinner, and he made a very finemartini. I had one. Then he started to fill my glass again, and I said, ‘No, Idon’t need another.’“He looked at me sort of queerly and he said, ‘You must have come over here fora serious purpose, if you won’t have two martinis.’“I said, ‘I have.’ So then I said to him, ‘I want you to know that I think thisis an evil business that’s going on. If the Republicans don’t repudiateMcCarthy, I’m going to vote the Democratic ticket.’”Eleanor’s threat only had the effect of “amusing” Foster, who asked his sister afew questions about why she felt the way she did, and then simply dropped thesubject.In the end, Foster Dulles never confronted McCarthy—even when the senatorrepeatedly embarrassed both the president and the secretary of state. Theadministration had no sooner taken office than McCarthy began using his Senatepower to hold up the nominations of key appointments, including close Eisenhowerassociates like Beetle Smith, who had been nominated to serve as Foster’sundersecretary of state. Smith had annoyed McCarthy at some point by sayingsomething positive about a State Department official whom the senator considereda card-carrying Communist.Eisenhower was infuriated by McCarthy’s antics. The senator was challenging thenew president’s authority to control his own government. Ike’s Cold Warpropaganda adviser, C. D. Jackson—a fascinating and somewhat mysteriouscharacter who had a background in the OSS and served as a sort of intelligencelink among the White House, the CIA, and Henry Luce’s media empire—advised thepresident to launch an all-out attack on McCarthy. But Nixon, who thought ofMcCarthy as a friend and essential ally, urged that the administration try tomake the troublesome senator a member of the team. Nixon was supported by othersin the president’s inner circle, including even the hot-tempered Beetle Smithhimself, who warned that a direct assault on McCarthy would risk splitting theRepublican Party.Eisenhower and the Dulles brothers decided to use Nixon as their mediator withMcCarthy. The two men were, in some ways, cut from the same rough cloth.Aggrieved outsiders in the Ivy League/Wall Street world of the power elite, theyhad both grabbed onto the club of anti-Communism as the blunt tool of theirferocious ambition. They had a working stiff’s bitterness that they clearlyenjoyed venting at Harvard types like Alger Hiss as much as they did athard-core Communists. McCarthy went as far as challenging the nomination ofHarvard University president James B. Conant as high commissioner to Germany,before Nixon talked him down.But Nixon was more sophisticated and intelligent than McCarthy. McCarthy’sambition was a raw force that he wielded with little or no concern for where hisblows might land—even if President Eisenhower or the mighty Dulles brothersstood in his way. Nixon, on the other hand, knew that men like these controlledhis path to the top, and he was eager to please them. He was, in AdlaiStevenson’s words, “McCarthy with a white collar.” The vice president keptsetting up private meetings with the headstrong senator, where he would try totalk sense into him, dangling political favors before his eyes.The easily dazzled McCarthy would take Nixon’s bait for a while, but a few dayslater he would come out swinging again, usurping Eisenhower’s power byannouncing his own anti-Communist measures or accusing another administrationnominee of some shocking infamy. In the end, not even the wily Nixon could bringMcCarthy under control as he thrashed about in the Washington arena.Foster, deathly afraid of losing the job for which he had been groomed sinceboyhood, did everything he could to placate the reckless McCarthy. The elderDulles, observed the veteran diplomat Charles “Chip” Bohlen, was a man “with oneobsession: to remain secretary of state.” To do that, Foster was willing tosacrifice nearly everything, including his dignity and the integrity of hisdepartment.“My brother was never a witch hunter,” Allen insisted years later, stilldefensive about the reputation his brother had developed during the McCarthyera. “I mean, he realized the subtleties of Communist penetration, and all that.But he didn’t go along with the sort of blanket condemnation of people.” Thetruth, however, is that Foster Dulles’s groveling efforts to pacify McCarthy notonly encouraged his aggression but institutionalized his witch hunt within theState Department.When Eisenhower nominated Chip Bohlen, who had served in the U.S. embassy inMoscow before and during the war, to be his ambassador to the Soviet Union,McCarthy inevitably detected something amiss with the distinguished diplomat—ahint of homosexuality somewhere in his family (it turned out that theallegations involved his brother-in-law). Bohlen was as upstanding a member ofthe foreign service club as the American establishment had ever produced:grandson of a U.S. senator, graduate of Harvard, respected member of thediplomatic corps since 1929, adviser to three presidents. Eisenhower decidedthat this time he would take a stand, and he recruited his rival—Senator RobertTaft, leader of the GOP’s right wing—to help push through Bohlen’s nomination.But Foster remained a bundle of nerves throughout the Bohlen confirmationprocess, terrified that if the nominee’s head were lopped off, his would benext. The secretary of state was ready at any moment to urge Eisenhower toabandon Bohlen if things got too hot on Capitol Hill. When Foster and Bohlenwere being driven to the nominee’s Senate confirmation hearing, Foster awkwardlyasked Bohlen not to be photographed with him. Later, after Bohlen was finallyconfirmed, Foster asked the new ambassador—who planned to fly to Moscow a weekor two ahead of his family—to delay his trip, so his solo arrival in Russiawould not set off another round of heated speculation about his sexuality.During the early months of the Eisenhower presidency, Foster repeatedlysurrendered to the McCarthy onslaught. When the senator shifted his target fromCommunists to homosexuals in the State Department, Foster allowed his employees’privacy to be blatantly violated. Ironically, it was McCarthy’s aggressive chiefcounsel, Roy Cohn, who took the lead in questioning suspected homosexuals. Cohn,whose heavy-lidded eyes and leathery, perpetually tanned skin gave him aserpentine look, was not only gay but had installed his twenty-six-year-oldplaymate, a rich golden boy with no particular credentials named David Schine,on his staff. The son of a hotel and movie theater tycoon, Schine was knownwhile a Harvard undergraduate for paying secretaries to take class notes forhim. “Essentially,” observed one Cold War historian, “Schine was Cohn’s dumbblonde.” Despite his own sexual leanings, Cohn took obvious pleasure inhumiliating the gay witnesses who appeared before the subcommittee, demanding toknow the locations of their illicit trysts and the names of their sexualpartners.McCarthy next went after the Voice of America, the State Department’s Cold Warpropaganda arm, which Allen Dulles had helped create, absurdly declaring itanother hotbed of Communist infestation. By April, 830 of the Voice of America’s1,400 employees had been purged, including its chief.That same month, Cohn and Schine announced that they were setting off for Europetogether to inspect the libraries maintained by U.S. embassies. These embassylibraries were supposed to be a “balanced collection of Americanthought”—showcases for U.S. tolerance and diversity. But Cohn and Schine weredetermined to cleanse the libraries of all books they suspected of a leftwardtilt. The pair’s investigative junket, which one subpoenaed author labeled “abook burning,” turned into a public relations disaster for the United States,provoking widespread revulsion and ridicule in the European press.While visiting Frankfurt, Cohn and Schine found other ways to embarrass theircountry, according to a local newspaper, engaging in flirtatious antics in ahotel lobby and leaving their hotel room in a shambles after a vigorous round ofhorseplay that the reporter left up to the reader’s imagination. But instead ofcriticizing McCarthy’s rowdy henchmen, Foster Dulles dutifully culled theembassy libraries of all ideologically impure books, including works byJean-Paul Sartre and Langston Hughes. Cohn even wanted to ban the soaringlyAmerican music of Aaron Copland from the libraries, which also loaned records,because the composer had made the mistake of signing petitions defending thecivil rights of labor leader Harry Bridges and other beleaguered left-wingheroes.This was Washington at the dawn of the Eisenhower-Dulles era, when the mostpowerful men in the capital lived in fear of being served subpoenas by a drunkensenator, when even John Foster Dulles trembled before McCarthy’s brute force. Itwould take Foster’s more iron-nerved brother to bring the beast to heel.In July 1953, after having his way with Foster Dulles’s State Department,McCarthy came after his brother’s CIA, announcing in his usual imprecise waythat he possessed “tons” of evidence that revealed widespread Communistinfiltration of the spy agency. McCarthy’s prime suspect was a bespectacled, IvyLeague–educated CIA analyst named William Bundy, whose profile made him theperfect embodiment of the Dulles agency man. A member of Yale’s secretive Skulland Bones society—breeding ground for future spooks—Bundy joined Armyintelligence during the war, working at Bletchley Park in England as part of theUltra operation that cracked Nazi codes. Dulles was close to Bundy’s father,Harvey, a top diplomat who had helped oversee the Marshall Plan, as well as hisyounger brother, McGeorge, another product of Skull and Bones and Armyintelligence who had worked with Dulles at the Council on Foreign Relations andon the Dewey presidential campaign.McCarthy hoped to make Bill Bundy his Alger Hiss, and, in fact, one of the mainpieces of incriminating evidence he waved against him was that Bundy hadcontributed $400 to the Alger Hiss defense fund. But the Bundys were solidmembers of Allen Dulles’s inner circle, and Dulles did not easily abandon menlike Bundy. The spymaster finally decided to draw the line with McCarthy—and theensuing, explosive confrontation led ultimately to the inquisitor’s downfall.Taking on McCarthy at the height of his power was a daunting task, even for thedirector of the CIA. Dulles knew that, despite J. Edgar Hoover’s growing doubtsabout McCarthy, the FBI still fed him a stream of damaging information about hisWashington enemies. Hoover, a sworn rival ever since Dulles outmaneuvered him tocreate the CIA in 1947, had amassed a thick file on Dulles and his busyadulterous life. Hoover even suspected Dulles of “secret communist leanings,” adelusion as fantastic as any of McCarthy’s wild claims. At least onehigh-ranking CIA official—Robert Amory, the agency’s top intelligenceanalyst—was convinced that the FBI had tapped his office phone.But Dulles, too, was a master at this sort of game, and he made sure his agencykept its own files on Hoover. Jim Angleton liked to say that any intelligenceservice that didn’t keep a close eye on its own government wasn’t worth itssalt. “Penetration begins at home,” he quipped. The CIA counterintelligencechief was rumored to occasionally show off photographic evidence of Hoover’sintimate relationship with FBI deputy Clyde Tolson, including a photo of Hooverorally pleasuring his longtime aide and companion. Dulles’s wisecrackingmistress Mary Bancroft liked to call the FBI director “that Virgin Mary inpants,” but there was nothing virginal about Hoover.Dulles compiled even more scandalous files on Joe McCarthy’s sex life. Thesenator who relentlessly hunted down homosexuals in government was widelyrumored to haunt the “bird circuit” near Grand Central Station as well as gayhideaways in Milwaukee. Drew Pearson got wind of the stories but was never ableto get enough proof to run with them. But the less discriminating HankGreenspun, editor and publisher of the Las Vegas Sun, who was locked in an uglywar of words with McCarthy, let the allegations fly. Greenspun had been givenaccess to the Pearson files, and he had picked up his own McCarthy storiesinvolving young hotel bellboys and elevator operators during the senator’sgambling trips to Vegas. “Joe McCarthy is a bachelor of 43 years,” wroteGreenspun. “He seldom dates girls and if he does, he laughingly describes it aswindow dressing. . . . It is common talk among homosexuals who rendezvous at theWhite Horse Inn [in Milwaukee] that Senator Joe McCarthy has often engaged inhomosexual activities.”McCarthy’s wedding announcement triggered more wicked chatter in the capital,where many saw it as an obvious ploy to dispel the rumors. The senator was assurprised as many others to read the announcement of his pending nuptials—it washis mother-in-law-to-be who placed the notice in the newspapers. McCarthy’syoung bride was described in one gossip magazine as “a bright, shrewd and veryambitious young lady. ‘Opportunist’ was the word many people used.”One Hoover aide later denied the gay reports about McCarthy, insisting that theallegations were blowback against the senator because he had dared to take onthe Dulles brothers. But Hoover kept his own secret files on McCarthy, one ofwhich was filled with disturbing stories about McCarthy’s habit of drunkenlygroping young girls’ breasts and buttocks. The stories were so widespread thatthey became “common knowledge” in the capital, according to one FBI chronicler.Walter Trohan, Washington bureau chief of the conservative Chicago Tribune, whowitnessed McCarthy’s molesting behavior, said, “He just couldn’t keep his handsoff young girls. Why the Communist opposition didn’t plant a minor on him andraise the cry of statutory rape, I don’t know.”“The Communist opposition” might have missed the opportunity, but the CIA wasclearly prepared to leak stories about McCarthy’s behavior—stories so sordid,they would have destroyed his career. This gave Dulles leverage in his battlewith McCarthy that none of the senator’s other political opponents enjoyed.There was an explosive sexual subtext to the CIA’s power struggle with McCarthy,one that was largely hidden from the public but would eventually erupt in theSenate hearings that brought him down.What the public witnessed was fascinating enough: a clash of titans that vergedon a constitutional crisis. When McCarthy tried to subpoena Bill Bundy, Dullessimply stonewalled him. The agency had Bundy spirited away to an undisclosedlocation, and when Roy Cohn called to demand that he testify before thesubcommittee—that very day—he was told that Bundy was on leave. WalterPforzheimer, the CIA’s legislative liaison, later remembered the phone call.“Roy was furious. . . . What a fight! Later that day, my secretary tracked medown to tell me Cohn wanted to talk to me [again]. And he wanted me to testifyabout Bundy’s file.” But Dulles simply “wouldn’t allow it.” When a subpoenaarrived for Pforzheimer, the CIA director was unfazed. “Allen Dulles just tookit and gave it to somebody. I wanted it for posterity, but no one’s ever foundit.”On July 9, 1953, an outraged McCarthy took to the floor of the Senate todenounce Dulles’s “blatant attempt to thwart the authority of the Senate” anddemanded that Dulles himself appear before his subcommittee. Dulles stillrefused to bend, but he did drop by McCarthy’s office to explain his position.Because of the highly sensitive nature of the CIA’s work, Dulles informed thesenator, his agency must be granted immunity from congressional investigations.McCarthy just had to take his word that there were no Communists hidden in theagency. If he ever did find any Reds, Dulles later explained to the press, “I’dkick them out. I have the power to do it and don’t have to have proof they workfor the Kremlin. The fact that a man is a Communist would be enough.”Dulles’s defiant position on congressional oversight astonished even theanti-McCarthy Democrats on the subcommittee, like Senator Stuart Symington. Butthe CIA director never wavered from his stand, and he soon won Eisenhower’ssupport. Nixon was again dispatched to meet with McCarthy, to work out aface-saving way for the senator to back down. Soon after, McCarthy announcedthat he and Dulles had come to a mutual agreement to suspend the probe of theCIA. Dulles drove home his victory by making sure that his friends in theWashington press corps reported McCarthy’s losing confrontation with the CIA asa major humiliation for the senator.On July 17, syndicated columnist Joseph Alsop—a journalist so deeply entwinedwith the CIA that he once declared it was his patriotic duty to carry theagency’s water—announced that “Senator Joseph R. McCarthy has just suffered hisfirst total, unmitigated, unqualified defeat. . . . [Administration strategists]have allowed McCarthy to conceal his defeat behind a typical smoke screen ofmisleading statements. But the background story proves that the junior Senatorfrom Wisconsin went down for the count of ten, all the same.”Dulles proudly collected newspaper coverage of his battle with McCarthy. He wasno doubt particularly pleased by one of the clippings he gathered, an article byThe Buffalo Evening News’s Washington correspondent, which reported that the CIAdirector is “known here as ‘John Foster Dulles’s tougher, younger brother.’”Not all of the press reaction to Dulles’s display of defiance was soenthusiastic. Two journalistic pillars whom the CIA director considered oldfriends—syndicated columnist Walter Lippmann and New York Times correspondentHanson Baldwin—took strong issue with the way Dulles had flouted Senateauthority. “The argument that the CIA is something apart, that it is so secretthat it differs in kind from the State Department or, for that matter, theDepartment of Agriculture, in untenable,” Lippmann opined. Baldwin struck aneven more critical note, warning of “a philosophy of secrecy and power” takinghold in Washington under the banner of national security.But Dulles’s firm stand against McCarthy—a man Richard Helms compared toGoebbels—proved enormously popular within the CIA, particularly among the ranksof the liberal, intellectual types whom Dulles had recruited. While Dulles andhis family were stalwart Republicans, he recognized that many of the mostpassionate Cold Warriors were ex-Communists and liberals who not only hadfirsthand knowledge of bare-knuckled Communist Party practices but were eager toprove their patriotism and join the American celebration. Dulles furthercemented his position with this liberal crowd when he stood by CIA recruit CordMeyer, another bright young product of Yale, who came under FBI suspicion inAugust 1953 for his postwar peace activities.After enduring years of relentless harassment from Red hunters, many Washingtonliberals cheered Dulles as a savior. His CIA became known as a haven for theintelligentsia and for others looked on with suspicion by McCarthyites. “Iemerged from [my FBI] ordeal with increased respect for Allen Dulles,” Meyerlater wrote. “Dulles proved to be a pillar of courageous strength inside theEisenhower administration during the McCarthy era. Once he had determined thefacts and satisfied himself as to the loyalty of a CIA official, he was preparedto defend him and he refused to give in to the pressures that McCarthy was ableto bring to bear. As a result, morale within the agency was high during thisperiod, in contrast to morale in the State Department where John Foster Dulleswas less willing to defend the innocent victims of McCarthy’s campaign.”Dulles’s defiance of McCarthy won the widespread devotion of liberals, but itestablished a dangerous precedent. In his very first year as director, Dullesbegan molding an image of the CIA as a super agency, operating high above meresenators. The CIA would grow more powerful and less accountable with eachpassing year of Dulles’s reign.McCarthy never got over his rough treatment at the hands of the CIA, and hewould threaten on more than one occasion to reopen his investigation of theagency. But if he had, he might have encountered an even more severe response.In March 1954, McCarthy’s subcommittee convened a hearing on “alleged threatsagainst the chairman.” One witness—a military intelligence officer named WilliamMorgan who had worked for C. D. Jackson in the White House—stunned thesubcommittee by recounting a conversation that he had the previous year with aCIA employee named Horace Craig. As the two men were discussing how to solve theMcCarthy problem, Craig flatly stated, “It may be necessary to liquidate SenatorMcCarthy as was [assassinated Louisiana senator] Huey Long. There is always somemadman who will do it for a price.”The Dulles slapdown of McCarthy proved to be a fateful turning point for thesenator, inspiring a new boldness within the Eisenhower administration thatwould lead to his collapse. A month later, in August 1953, when McCarthy tookaim at Reds in the Agriculture Department, of all places, Nixon advisedAgriculture Secretary Ezra Taft Benson to “take a firm stand, like Allen Dulles,if McCarthy gets out of line.” In September, after returning from his honeymoon,McCarthy made his final—and fatal—mistake, by taking on another centralinstitution of U.S. national security, the Army.Like Foster Dulles, the spineless Army Secretary, a former textile executivenamed Robert Ten Broeck Stevens, had done everything he could to appeaseMcCarthy, but the senator had only grown more frothing in his attacks, accusingthe Army of sloppy security measures that had led to the hiring of subversivecivilians. At one point, McCarthy dragged a decorated D-day hero, General RalphW. Zwicker, before his panel and dressed him down like he was a bumbling BeetleBailey, barking at the dignified, ramrod-stiff officer that he was “not fit towear that uniform.”Much of the anti-Army spleen in the McCarthy office was inspired by theadolescent frustrations of the senator’s twenty-six-year-old chief counsel, RoyCohn. When Cohn’s boyfriend, David Schine, was drafted into the Army in October1953, McCarthy’s point man began frantically pulling strings on his behalf.Assigned to Fort Dix in New Jersey for basic training, Schine was showered withspecial privileges, including frequent exemptions from KP duty and weekendpasses so he could be chauffeured to New York City for R&R with Cohn. (Theirchauffeur would later testify that the two men also used his vehicle’s backseatfor their passionate reunions.) Schine, who found his Army issue bootsuncomfortable, was even allowed to wear custom-made boots. When Cohn was toldthat his boyfriend might be transferred overseas, he flew into a rage. “We’llwreck the Army,” he spluttered at the Army’s liaison to the subcommittee. “TheArmy will be ruined . . . if you pull a dirty, lousy, stinking, filthy, shittydouble cross like that.”After months of trying to manage McCarthy, Eisenhower finally reached hisbreaking point. In February 1954, Massachusetts Republican senator Henry CabotLodge, a close ally of the president, privately warned that the Armyinvestigation was “an attempt to destroy the president politically. There is nodoubt about it. He is picking on the Army because Eisenhower was in the Army.”The following month, the president authorized Lodge to ask for the publicationof a damning report that the Army had been secretly compiling on the numerousways that McCarthy and Cohn had bullied and blackmailed military authorities onSchine’s behalf. In response to the scorching Schine report, McCarthy’ssubcommittee removed him as chairman and called for hearings on the Army’sallegations. The stage was set for the Army-McCarthy hearings, a televisedspectacle that turned the inquisitional tables on the senator and finally endedhis infamous reign.McCarthy—who was allowed to participate in the proceedings—gave his usual crudeperformance, badgering witnesses and shouting “point of order” whenever he feltthe urge to disrupt the drama. But captured in the glare of the TV lights, hiscoarse act had a repellent effect on the viewing public. By the time the Army’sdistinguished Boston attorney, Joseph Nye Welch, uttered his devastating andinstantly memorable line—“Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, haveyou left no sense of decency?”—the American people knew the answer.In December 1954, the Senate voted to censure McCarthy, and he continued hisslide toward oblivion, drinking more and more heavily until he was polishing offa bottle of the hard stuff a day. By 1956, those who knew the senator weredescribing him as a “sick pigeon” suffering from a host of physical ailments andshuttling in and out of detox. During a visit home to Wisconsin in September, hewas seized by delirium tremens and saw snakes flying at him. In May 1957, he wasadmitted to Bethesda Naval Hospital, where he died of acute liver failure at ageforty-eight. Joe McCarthy had drunk himself to death.McCarthy’s confrontation with the Army would become famous for his undoing, butit was his earlier battle with Allen Dulles that had drawn first blood and madehim vulnerable. As McCarthy’s stature in Washington shrank, Dulles’s grew. Nopolitician during the Eisenhower era would ever again seriously challenge theCIA director’s rule. With his Washington power base secure, Dulles was ready totake on the world."},{"pageContent":"10 [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-25]THE DULLES IMPERIUM [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-25]On the afternoon of August 18, 1953, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, thethirty-three-year-old shah of Iran, and his glamorous twenty-one-year-old wife,Queen Soraya, swept into the gilded lobby of the Hotel Excelsior on Rome’sfashionable Via Veneto. The young royal couple cut a striking image, with theslim shah wearing a trimly tailored, light gray, double-breasted suit and darkglasses, and his petite, voluptuous queen calling to mind the exotic beauty ofSophia Loren. Soraya was half Persian and half German and had almond-shaped,green-blue eyes described as the most beautiful in the world by an Italiandirector who years later cast her as the leading lady in one of his movies. Buton this day, the Iranian royals looked “worn, gloomy and anxious” in the wordsof a Times of London reporter—one of a flock of scribblers and paparazzi who hadswarmed the couple when they disembarked from their BOAC plane at CiampinoAirport and pursued them to their hotel. Back home in Tehran, violent mobscontrolled the streets of the capital, and after twenty-eight years on thePeacock Throne, the Pahlavi dynasty seemed on the verge of collapse. Fearing fortheir lives, the shah and his wife had fled his homeland carrying only a coupleof suitcases, taking off in his private Beechcraft jet for Baghdad—the first legof their journey—with such haste that they forgot to take the queen’s beloveddog.Accustomed to royal opulence and the slavish attentions of his court, the youngshah seemed lost in exile. “We do not have much money,” the shah warned hiswife, who as the daughter of a prominent Iranian diplomat was also used to aluxurious lifestyle. He told Soraya they would have to be “very careful” withtheir spending. Before they fled, he had even asked her whether they could sellsome of their wedding gifts, which included a mink coat and a desk set withblack diamonds from Joseph Stalin and a Steuben glass bowl designed by SidneyWaugh that had been sent by President Truman.During their first night at the Hotel Excelsior, the distraught shah paced theliving room of their small suite, unable to sleep. He kept his personal pilotawake late into the night, fretting about the future that awaited him. The shahbegged the pilot, one of only two retainers who accompanied the royal couple toRome, to stay with him in exile. “Who is going to play tennis with me if youleave me?” asked the forlorn ruler.But the shah was far from abandoned as he and Queen Soraya took up residence atthe Excelsior. The CIA, which had prevailed upon the Persian industrialist whoowned the fourth-floor suite to make it available to the royal couple, waskeeping the shah under its watchful care. The Iranian monarchs found theiraccommodations to their liking. The luxury hotel’s Belle Époque–era grandeur hadbeen drawing royal guests since the turn of the twentieth century. In the 1950s,the hotel enjoyed a la dolce vita revival, attracting a new wave of kings andqueens from Hollywood, including Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, and AudreyHepburn and Gregory Peck. (John Wayne claimed that he scored his most memorableone-night stand at the Excelsior, with Marlene Dietrich. “I took her on thestaircase,” he boasted.)The Excelsior had also become a favorite rendezvous spot for espionage agentsfrom around the world, as well as Italian men of mystery. Licio Gelli—leader ofPropaganda Due, the conspiratorial Masonic order whose intrigues underminedItalian democracy for many years—kept three adjoining rooms at the hotel. Thediscreet gentlemen who paid visits to Gelli—whose secret anti-Communistoperations drew funding from the CIA—would enter Room 127, conduct business inRoom 128, and then exit through Room 129.More important from the shah’s point of view, the Excelsior was also favored byAllen Dulles on his visits to Rome. That August, he and Clover were vacationingin Switzerland when the spymaster suddenly informed his wife they were leavingfor Italy, and on the afternoon of August 18 the Dulleses checked into theExcelsior at the same time as the shah and Queen Soraya. Frank Wisner insistedthe simultaneous arrival of the two couples was a complete coincidence. “Theyboth showed up at the reception desk at the Excelsior at the very same moment,”Wisner told a CIA associate, with tongue undoubtedly firmly in cheek. “AndDulles had to say, ‘After you, Your Majesty.’”Dulles’s arrival in Rome was conveniently timed. By the following morning, themobs running riot through the streets of Tehran were led and financed by theCIA—the final act in a covert drama aimed at overthrowing the democraticallyelected government of Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh and restoring the shah’sautocratic rule. Mossadegh, a dedicated patriot and wily survivor of Iran’streacherous politics, had antagonized the British government by nationalizingthe powerful Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (later renamed British Petroleum) soonafter taking office in 1951. The British behemoth—the third-largest producer ofcrude oil in the world—ruled Iran with imperial arrogance for much of thetwentieth century, crushing labor strikes in the hellish oil fields and proppingup and replacing local regimes at will. Mossadegh’s defiant seizure of Iran’soil treasure set off a global thunderclap. “By the end of the 1980s, mostcountries in the Middle East and North Africa, as well as Asia and LatinAmerica, had nationalized their oil, and thus gained influence over worldprices,” observed historian Ervand Abrahamian. “In the early 1950s, however,such a loss was seen as heralding the ‘end of civilization’—not only for Britainbut also for consumers throughout the industrial world.”After Mossadegh’s bold move, the British spy agency MI6 began workingstrenuously to undermine his government. When the prime minister responded tothe British plotting by shutting down the British embassy in Tehran and ejectingthe ambassador, London turned to Washington for assistance.The Dulleses were more than willing to help. Through their law firm, thebrothers had long ties to major U.S. oil companies like Standard Oil, whichstrongly supported the tough British stand against Mossadegh, with hopes ofsecuring their own stake in the Iranian oil fields. Allen had another formerclient with a big interest in the Iranian oil dispute: the London-based J. HenrySchroder Banking Corporation, on whose board he served, was the financial agentfor Anglo-Iranian Oil.The Dulles brothers had demonstrated their dedication to their former Sullivanand Cromwell petroleum clients soon after President Eisenhower took office bysabotaging a Justice Department antitrust case against the Seven Sisters oilgiants. The price-fixing case against the oil cartel, a holdover from the Trumanyears, was reduced from a criminal to a civil charge and convenientlytransferred to Foster Dulles’s jurisdiction, the first time in U.S. history thatan antitrust case was handed over to the State Department for prosecution.Foster argued that the case had national security implications, and it quietlydisappeared, leaving Big Oil unscathed.Furthermore, Allen Dulles had a business history with the shah. In 1949, whilestill employed as a Sullivan and Cromwell rainmaker, Dulles had flown to Tehran,where he met the shah and negotiated a stunningly lucrative deal on behalf of anew company called Overseas Consultants Inc., a consortium of eleven large U.S.engineering firms. Iran agreed to pay OCI a Croesus-like fortune of $650 millionfor which the consortium pledged to modernize the backward nation, buildinghydroelectric plants, importing industries, and transforming entire cities.“This would be the largest overseas development project in modern history,”noted Dulles biographer Stephen Kinzer. “It was the greatest triumph of Allen’slegal career. For Sullivan and Cromwell it opened a world of possibilities.”The shah realized that Allen Dulles could be an important ally. And indeedDulles repaid the young ruler’s generosity by opening doors for him in New Yorkand Washington. In November 1949, Dulles hosted an exclusive dinner party forthe visiting potentate in the dining room of the Council on Foreign Relations.The shah’s remarks were music to the ears of the dinner guests. “My governmentand people are eager to welcome American capital, to give it all possiblesafeguards,” he assured them. “Nationalization of industry is not planned.”But the rise of Mossadegh and his National Front political alliance disruptedthe dream of prosperity that the shah had spun for his privileged audience.Mossadegh’s coalition led the opposition to the OCI deal, which National Frontleaders denounced as a massive giveaway that would “break the back of futuregenerations.” This patriotic rhetoric stirred the passions of the Iranianpeople, whose fate had long been determined by foreign powers. In December 1950,Iran’s parliament voted not to fund the monumental development project, therebykilling the chances of Dulles and OCI for a huge payday and forever poisoningthe spymaster’s perceptions of Mossadegh.Western observers found Mossadegh a perplexing character—strongly phobic toBritish colonial attitudes but touchingly hopeful about an alliance with thegrowing U.S. empire. The aging, balding leader was a mercurial personality,given to emotional outbursts and fainting spells. His long, mournful face gavehim a funereal look, but he was capable of boyishly enthusiastic behavior. On avisit to Washington in October 1951, the new prime minister charmed Trumanadministration officials. Secretary of State Dean Acheson was tickled by his“delightfully childlike way of sitting in a chair with his legs tucked underhim.”In the beginning, Eisenhower also seemed sympathetic to Mossadegh, who sent thepresident-elect a heartfelt note on the eve of his inauguration, bemoaning theeconomic blockade that Britain had imposed on Iran and asking for U.S.assistance. There was a beguilingly innocent tone to the Iranian leader’s plea:“It is not my desire that the relations between the United States and the UnitedKingdom should be strained because of differences with regard to Iran. I doubthowever whether in this day and age a great nation which has such an exaltedmoral standing in the world [as the U.S.] can afford to support theinternationally immoral policy of a friend and ally. . . . The Iranian peoplemerely desire to lead their own lives in their own way. They wish to maintainfriendly relations with all other peoples. [But Anglo-Iranian Oil Company],which for years was engaged in exploiting [our] oil resources, unfortunately haspersisted in interfering in the internal life of [our] country.”Eisenhower’s innate midwestern sense of decency initially made him recoil frombacking Britain’s colonial siege of Iran. He rebuffed the Dulles brothers’advice, suggesting that it might be a better idea to stabilize Mossadegh’sgovernment with a $100 million loan than to topple it. If Eisenhower hadfollowed through on his original instincts, the bedeviled history of U.S.-Iranrelations would undoubtedly have taken a far different course.An air of tragic heroism clung to Mossadegh. When American envoys made alast-ditch effort to persuade him to appease the British oil giant, he proudlyrefused. The history of Iran’s leadership was plagued by cowardice andcorruption, said Mossadegh, and he would not continue this sorry legacy.Anglo-Iranian Oil had already been offered fair compensation for its losses;Mossadegh would not compromise the resource rights of his country any further.If he cut a deal with the British, the prime minister told U.S. mediators, hisreputation would be forever stained with the Iranian people, who wouldimmediately assume that their nation had been sold out once more. Mossadegh’sadamant defense of Iranian sovereignty made him a beloved figure in hishomeland, with a popular referendum at the height of the Iran crisis giving himnearly unanimous support.Realizing that Eisenhower was not inclined to defend British imperial interests,the Dulles brothers reframed their argument for intervention in Cold War terms.On March 4, 1953, Allen appeared at a National Security Council meeting in theWhite House armed with seven pages of alarming talking points. Iran wasconfronted with “a maturing revolutionary set-up,” he warned, and if the countryfell into Communist hands, 60 percent of the free world’s oil would becontrolled by Moscow. Oil and gasoline would have to be rationed at home, andU.S. military operations would have to be curtailed.In truth, the global crisis over Iran was not a Cold War conflict but a struggle“between imperialism and nationalism, between First and Third Worlds, betweenNorth and South, between developed industrial economies and underdevelopedcountries dependent on exporting raw materials,” in the words of ErvandAbrahamian. Dulles made Mossadegh out to be a “stooge” of the Communists—but hewas far from it. The scion of an aristocratic Persian family, the prime ministerwas educated in France and Switzerland, and tilted more toward the West than inthe direction of Iran’s feared Soviet neighbor to the north. Mossadegh was afervent nationalist, not a secret Communist—another Gandhi, in the assessment ofone British foreign official, not a Mao. The Tudeh, Iran’s Communist Party,regarded Mossadegh with a decided wariness, viewing him as a “liberal bourgeois”with dangerous illusions about America. Mossadegh, in turn, relied on theTudeh’s support when it suited him but kept his distance, seeing the party astoo subservient to Moscow. Meanwhile, Soviet leadership remained reluctant toget too deeply involved in Iranian politics for fear of threatening the West’sinterests there.But after weeks of intensive lobbying by the Dulles brothers and the Britishgovernment, Eisenhower became convinced that Iran was a Cold War battlegroundand that Mossadegh had to go. In June 1953, Allen presented the CIA plan tooverthrow Mossadegh’s government to his brother at a special meeting of nationalsecurity policy makers held in Foster’s office.The coup plan had been drawn up by Kermit “Kim” Roosevelt Jr., Allen’shandpicked man to run the operation on the ground in Iran. The well-bredgrandson of Theodore Roosevelt did not seem like the sort of cutthroat characterto carry out such a disreputable task. Roosevelt was well regarded even byideological enemies like Kim Philby. “Oddly enough, I dubbed [Roosevelt] ‘thequiet American’ five years before Graham Greene wrote his book,” Philby oncenoted. “He was a courteous, soft-spoken Easterner with impeccable socialconnections, well-educated rather than intellectual, pleasant and unassuming ashost and guest. An equally nice wife. In fact, the last person you would expectto be up to the neck in dirty tricks.”Indeed, Roosevelt was taken aback by the blithe way that the fate of Iran’sdemocracy was discussed in Foster’s office that day. “This was a grave decisionto have made,” he later observed. “In fact, I was morally certain that almosthalf of those present, if they had felt free or had the courage to speak, wouldhave opposed the undertaking.”But the Dulles brothers had already made up their minds about Iran and theyallowed no room for debate. And once the brothers fixed the administration onits fateful course, they were confident that they had the right man for the job.The Dulleses could see the ruthless streak beneath Kim Roosevelt’s smooth Grotonand Harvard polish. Three years earlier, they had recruited Roosevelt to work inIran as a lobbyist for their ill-fated Overseas Consultants Inc. deal. And forthe past two years, he had been spearheading a secret CIA operation to organizean underground resistance network inside Iran, burying crates of guns and cashin the desert to distribute to tribal warriors in case of a Soviet invasion.Roosevelt now turned this clandestine effort against Iran’s elected government,hiring bands of mercenaries and paying military leaders to betray their country.When push came to shove, Kim Roosevelt revealed that he shared his grandfather’senthusiasm for imperial misadventures.The U.S. and British intelligence operatives running the anti-Mossadeghoperation were prepared to go to any lengths to accomplish their task. Keyofficials in the military and government who remained loyal to Mossadegh werekidnapped and murdered, such as General Mahmoud Afshartous, the officer incharge of purging the armed forces of traitorous elements. The general’s mangledcorpse was found dumped on a roadside outside Tehran as a message to allofficials who chose to stand by the prime minister. Other prominent loyalistshad their throats slit and their bodies buried far away in the Alborz Mountains.In the end, as Tudeh Party leaders feared, Mossadegh was undone by his faith inthe American government. The prime minister still controlled the streets ofTehran on August 18, with National Front and Tudeh militants roaming throughoutthe capital and toppling royal statues and other symbols of the shah’s rule. Butafter conferring with Roosevelt, U.S. ambassador Loy Henderson—the Dullesbrothers’ other canny emissary in Iran—arranged a fateful meeting withMossadegh. During the hourlong meeting, Henderson vehemently protested theanti-Western “mob attacks”—which he claimed had even threatened the U.S. embassyand assaulted his chauffeur. Henderson warned that if the prime minister did notrestore order, the United States would have to evacuate all Americans andwithdraw recognition of Mossadegh’s government. The gambit worked. Mossadegh“lost his nerve,” according to Henderson, and immediately ordered his policechief to clear the streets. It was, the U.S. diplomat later observed, “the oldman’s fatal mistake.”With Mossadegh’s supporters off the streets, the CIA’s hired thugs were free totake their place, backed by rebellious elements of the military. On the morningof August 19, as Mossadegh huddled in his home at 109 Kakh Street with hisadvisers, tanks driven by pro-shah military officers and street gangs whosepockets were literally stuffed with CIA cash converged on the prime minister’sresidence.For two hours, a firefight raged outside Mossadegh’s home, which was protectedby three tanks commanded by officers loyal to the prime minister. But the rebelforces had two dozen tanks at their disposal, including two powerful U.S.-builtShermans, and the outcome was predictable. As shells tore into his residence,Mossadegh ordered his tank commander to cease fire. The seventy-one-year-oldprime minister and his top aides then scaled the wall to a neighboring house,barely escaping the wrath of the hired mob, which proceeded to smash down thegreen grill gate and ransack the official residence. One of the brave officersin charge of defending the prime minister was torn limb from limb by therampaging mob. Soon after, Mossadegh and the other officials were arrested andimprisoned in a military barracks, thereby ending Iran’s brief interlude ofdemocracy.Mohammad Mossadegh had been violently evicted from office, but the CIA coupcould not be successfully completed until the shah returned home to reclaim histhrone. As the coup got under way, Kim Roosevelt had worked frantically toprevent the shah from fleeing the country, telling him that it was his duty tostand with the rebel forces and assuring him of U.S. protection. But couragefailed “the king of kings.” He was “a wimp,” in the candid estimation ofRoosevelt, who had stuck it out in Iran even after the shah had taken flight andthe CIA had told their intrepid agent that he should do the same.As the tumultuous events unfolded in Tehran, the shah and Queen Soraya werephotographed on a shopping excursion along Via Condotti, dipping in and out ofthe Gucci, Dior, and Hermès showcases that lined Rome’s fashion avenue. Despitehis budget worries, the shah mustered the nerve to buy himself four tennisrackets and a pair of black antelope shoes, as well as lingerie, two crocodilehandbags, and a dozen summer frocks for his wife. The paparazzi later snappedSoraya in one of her stylish outfits, an eye-catching polka-dot dress thatexposed her lovely bronzed shoulders.As the coup reached its climax, Dulles was monitoring the operation from hisbunker in the U.S. embassy, just down the block from the Excelsior. Thespymaster’s vigil was no doubt enlivened by the presence of the Americanambassador to Rome, the seductive and witty Clare Booth Luce, wife of Henry Luceand a celebrated playwright. While Clover entertained herself at the Excelsior,Dulles, who was rumored to be sexually involved with the attractive ambassador,spent long nights at the embassy. Although Clare Luce was an ardent convert toCatholicism and was later known for a widely reprinted speech decrying theanything goes “new morality” toward sex, she and her husband seemed to have asense of aristocratic license when it came to their own sex lives. While Dulleswas dallying with Luce’s wife, the magazine mogul was enjoying himself withDulles’s wartime mistress, Mary Bancroft.But the strongest link between Dulles and the Luces was their shared convictionthat they were driving forces behind what Henry had christened “the AmericanCentury.” Luce coined the term in a 1941 Life magazine editorial, calling forthe United States to take a dominant role in global affairs, “exert[ing] uponthe world the full impact of our influence, for such purposes as we see fit andby such means as we see fit.” In effect, Luce was calling for the United States,on the brink of entering World War II, to replace Britain as the new worldempire—not by holding overseas territories, as in the passing colonial era, butby flexing its military, commercial, and cultural strength. Luce’s missionaryvision of American power, which would find echoes in a later generation’sembrace of “American exceptionalism,” meshed neatly with that of the Dullesbrothers. But while Luce could only preach about the historic imperative ofAmerican power, Allen Dulles was in a position to act on it.Dulles’s main mission in Rome was to stiffen the shah’s spine and whisk him backto the Peacock Throne. The royal couple were taking their lunch in the Excelsiordining room when they heard that Mossadegh had been overthrown. The shah seemedshaken by the news instead of overjoyed. His “jaw dropped,” according to oneobserver, and “his trembling fingers reached for a cigarette.” He lookedchastened. “I have to admit that I haven’t had a very important part in therevolution,” he murmured. But Soraya was upbeat. “How exciting,” she trilled,placing a reassuring hand on her husband’s arm. Dulles quickly arranged aspecial commercial flight to take the shah home.Soraya, pronouncing herself not quite ready to face the clamor, stayed on inRome a while longer. She was also consulting feverishly with a prominentAmerican gynecologist flown in by the CIA to help her get pregnant. “Four timesa night,” she told the doctor, “and twice every afternoon. Still I don’t have ababy.” Soraya never overcame her infertility. Frustrated by the queen’sinability to provide the Pahlavi dynasty with an heir, a weeping shah wouldannounce their divorce in 1958. Aided by a generous royal settlement, Sorayareturned to luxurious exile in Rome, where she became the lover of Italiandirector Franco Indovina and had a brief film career.As the shah boarded his chartered KLM airliner home, he knew that he wasreturning to a roiling tempest in Iran, where he was widely reviled by hissubjects as a puppet of Western powers. But, according to some accounts, Dulleshimself helped brace the shaky ruler by accompanying him on the flight toTehran. The CIA also spread around more cash to make sure his arrival would begreeted by cheering crowds. Two retainers flung themselves on the ground to kisshis feet as he made his way down the reception line at the airport. The shahwarmly greeted Ambassador Henderson, one of the “heroes” of the coup. By thetime he was carried back to the palace in the royal limousine, past thedutifully enthusiastic throngs on the streets, the shah had convinced himselfthat he was indeed a man of destiny—instead of just another creature of the CIA.“The shah is living in a dream world,” Henderson drily remarked. “He seems tothink his restoration was due entirely to his popularity with his people.”Dulles would look back on the coup in Iran as one of the two greatest triumphsof his CIA career, along with the regime change he engineered in Guatemala thefollowing year. This was the sort of daring high-wire act that gave him thebiggest professional thrill, and it left him with a taste for more. Dullesimagined himself a character in a John Buchan spy novel, Kim Roosevelt told CIAMiddle East hand Miles Copeland, and the spymaster “wouldn’t be able to restrainhimself—or us” if the opportunity arose anywhere else to repeat the agency’sexploits in Iran. “Allen would give his left . . . well, let us say indexfinger,” said Roosevelt, “if he could go somewhere in the field and engineer acoup d’état himself.”Dulles’s handiwork could also be seen in the compliant U.S. press coverage ofthe regime change. News reports on the coup assiduously avoided looking into theCIA’s deep involvement. Newsweek gave Dulles’s appearance at the Excelsior acurious wink and a nod, but then quickly passed on. Amid “the hubbub” overMossadegh’s fall, noted the magazine, the CIA director suddenly was spotted inthe hotel—but “no one paid any attention to him.”Dulles not only persuaded his high-placed friends in the press to throw a cloakover the CIA’s operation, he convinced them to share his exuberance over itssuccess. A Washington Post editorial saw the overturning of Iran’s democraticgovernment as a “cause to rejoice.” The New York Times took a similarcelebratory line, calling Mossadegh “a rabid, self-seeking nationalist” whose“unlamented” disappearance from the political stage “brings us hope.” The U.S.press even avoided using awkward words like “coup,” preferring to describe theCIA-engineered operation as a “popular uprising” or a “nation’s revolt.”If Dulles carefully concealed the CIA’s role from the American public, he madesure that the shah was made fully aware of the debt he owed the agency. U.S.national security forces would continue to prop up the shah’s reign for the nextquarter of a century, encouraging the ruler’s “megalomania,” as Jesse Leaf, whoserved for a time as the CIA’s chief analyst on Iran, remarked. But the agency’scontempt for the man on the Peacock Throne only grew with time. Leaf found him“basically a hollow man, a straw man, a pipsqueak.”But the hollow man proved very useful for Western interests, including those ofsome of the Dulles brothers’ leading former clients. Under a new agreement withthe major oil companies orchestrated by the shah a few months after the coup,Iran’s oil industry was denationalized. Once again, the country’s naturaltreasure was handed over to foreign corporations, with 40 percent of the spoilsnow going to American oil producers, including Gulf, Texaco, Mobil, Standard Oilof New Jersey, and Standard Oil of California.Kim Roosevelt was among those who cashed in on the coup, leaving the CIA in 1958to join the management of Gulf Oil, where he took charge of the company’srelations with foreign governments, including the Iran regime. Later, he becamean international consultant, representing the shah and serving as a middlemanfor weapons manufacturers doing business with Iran. The shah remained deeplyloyal to his CIA friends, once toasting Roosevelt at a palace ceremony as one ofthe powerful forces, along with the Almighty, to whom he owed his throne.The Iran coup had an intoxicating effect on the Eisenhower administration,coursing through the Oval Office, the CIA, and the State Department like achampagne glow. “It was a day that should never have ended,” stated a rapturousinternal CIA report on the coup. “For it carried with it such a sense ofexcitement, of satisfaction and of jubilation that it is doubtful whether anyother can come up to it.” The president summoned the now mythic Roosevelt to theWhite House to make a special presentation on his Persian escapade. A spellboundEisenhower later said that it was more like listening to a rousing “dime novel”than a government briefing. When Roosevelt looked over at the secretary of statemidway through his presentation, Foster was leaning back leisurely in his chair,and it appeared for a moment as if he might be dozing. But then Rooseveltrealized that Foster’s “eyes were gleaming. He seemed to be purring like a giantcat.”But what for Washington was a tale of derring-do right out of The ScarletPimpernel was for Iran a disaster without end. The country’s fledgling democracywas dismantled, and members of oppositional parties and the press were roundedup or driven underground. With the CIA’s strong encouragement, the shahunleashed his secret police organizations—first the Second Bureau, and in 1957the infamous SAVAK—in a ruthless campaign to root out “subversion.” The Tudehbore the brunt of the crackdown. With CIA assistance, the shah’s U.S.-trainedsecurity forces tracked down over four thousand party members between 1953 and1957. Many were subjected to primitive torture methods, including whippings andbeatings, the smashing of chairs on heads, and the breaking of fingers. A fewwere subjected to the gruesome qapani, in which they were hung from hooks. Atleast eleven people died under torture during this period, most from brainhemorrhages, and dozens more were executed.The regime grew alarmed when reports began circulating about the condemnedprisoners’ heroism—how they had gone to their deaths singing defiant songs anddenouncing the shah. It was reported that the firing squads’ bullets oftenmissed their targets, either “through nervousness or deliberate avoidance,” andthat officers had to dispatch the prisoners with pistol shots. The regime wasforced to clamp a tighter lid on future rounds of executions, out of fear thatthe prisoners’ show of “bravado” was “impressing large segments of the public.”All hope for change was ripped from the hearts of the Iranian people, replacedby poisonous seeds whose bitter fruit grew slowly over the next two decades. Theshah ultimately reaped what he had sown, driven into his final exile in 1979 bya popular revolt led by the country’s Islamic mandarins, the only oppositionalsector of Iranian society not crushed by the Pahlavi regime. The Americans andIranians are still paying for “the day that should never have ended.”After his arrest, Mossadegh was put on trial for treason. He responded bytelling the court that his real crime was that he had “resisted imperialism.”The U.S. embassy fretted that his trial was a “serious blunder,” since itreinforced the popular leader’s “demigod” status and his mystical “hold over thepublic.” Fearing that executing him would only make him more of a martyr, theregime sentenced Mossadegh to three years of solitary confinement and thenbanished him to his rural village, sixty miles north of Tehran, where he livedout the rest of his days in a small, white-walled house. When he died nine yearslater, at age eighty-four, the shah blocked efforts to organize a public funeralceremony. Even in death, Mossadegh was taunted by the U.S. press, with a wirestory by the Associated Press portraying him as an “iron dictator” who hadterrorized his enemies and “brought the country to economic chaos.” Theambulance carrying his body from a hospital in Tehran to his home went “almostunnoticed,” the news item gloated. “In the downtown bazaar, crowds went abouttheir shopping for the Persian New Year.”The shah refused Mossadegh’s final request—to be buried in the main Tehrancemetery, alongside the bodies of his supporters who had been shot down in thestreets by the army. Instead, he was buried underneath his own sitting room,near a mantelpiece where a picture of Gandhi gazed serenely over him.The Eisenhower-Dulles era was a Pax Americana enforced by terror. Theadministration ensured U.S. postwar global dominance by threatening enemies withnuclear annihilation or with coups and assassinations. It was empire on thecheap, a product of Ike’s desire to avoid another large-scale shooting war aswell as the imperial burdens that had bankrupted Great Britain. By leveragingthe U.S. military’s near monopoly on nuclear firepower, the president hoped tomake war an unthinkable proposition for any and all American adversaries. And byutilizing the CIA’s dark sleight of hand, the commander in chief aimed to renderit unnecessary for the Marines to go crashing ashore in far-flung locales whereunfriendly governments had taken office.Dwight Eisenhower himself was a peace-loving warrior, the son of a pacifistmother who had cried when he was admitted into West Point. Though he neverexperienced combat firsthand—a gap in his military résumé that he sorelyregretted through much of his career—Eisenhower saw more than his share of theeffects of war, touring the blood-soaked battlefields after World War I and thestill-smoking ruins of Europe and newly liberated Nazi death camps followingWorld War II. As the Supreme Allied Commander, Eisenhower acutely felt thesacrifice that he was asking of the thousands of young men under his leadership.While the general and his staff prepared to dispatch waves of soldiers onto thebeaches of Normandy in June 1944—over ten thousand of whom would be killed orwounded on D-day—he suffered wrenching stomach pains, soaring blood pressure,recurring headaches and throat infections, and chronic insomnia. “He was asnervous as I had ever seen him and extremely depressed,” recalled Kay Summersby,the general’s wartime secretary and intimate companion.Eisenhower also felt the enormous responsibility of sitting in the Oval Officeat the dawn of a new era in which science had given U.S. leaders the means todestroy virtually all life on the planet. But while privately grasping theunprecedented gravity of the moment, he publicly adopted a disturbinglynonchalant attitude toward the new weapons of mass destruction.Eisenhower biographer Evan Thomas later called his nuclear brinksmanship “Ike’sbluff,” a bold strategy to keep the world at peace by threatening total war.There was a perverse logic to the Eisenhower-Dulles policy of massiveretaliation. But by reserving the right to use nuclear weapons anytime andanyplace that U.S. interests were threatened, the administration kept the worldin a state of perpetual anxiety. As the Soviet Union began narrowing the nuclearweapons gap in the 1950s, the planet was held hostage by the growing tensionsbetween the two superpowers—the United States and the USSR were “two scorpionsin a bottle” in the memorable phrase of nuclear physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer.Did Eisenhower really believe that nuclear explosives were just anotherconventional military tool, as he indicated at a March 1955 press conferencewhen asked if he might consider using them during a confrontation with Chinaover two tiny, obscure islands in the Formosa Strait? “I see no reason why theyshouldn’t be used just exactly as you would use a bullet or anything else,”Eisenhower announced. Or did he realize that nuclear arms had made warunthinkable, as he noted in his diary the following year, soon after declaringhis candidacy for a second term? “The problem is not man against man, or nationagainst nation,” Eisenhower wrote. “It is man against war.”Eisenhower seemed to revel in the terrible uncertainty that he created, seeingit as a way to intimidate enemies and keep them off balance. After thepresident’s nuclear “bullet” statement, White House press secretary Jim Hagertynervously asked his boss how he planned to handle follow-up questions about theatom bomb option. Ike smiled and said, “Don’t worry, Jim, if that question comesup, I’ll just confuse them.”The problem with Eisenhower’s strategy was that by keeping Washington in aconstant state of high alert, he empowered the most militant voices in hisadministration, including the Dulles brothers and Pentagon hard-liners likeAdmiral Arthur Radford and Air Force general Curtis LeMay—who, taking theircommander in chief at his word, continually agitated for a cataclysmicconfrontation with the Soviet Union. Eisenhower once said that he feared his own“boys” in the military more than he did a sneak attack from the Soviets, who, ashe observed, had suffered so devastatingly during World War II that they wouldbe deeply reluctant to risk World War III. The president did not think any ofhis nuclear commanders would go rogue, but he knew that the constant Pentagonpressure for bigger doomsday arsenals produced equally strong temptations to usethe weapons—particularly while the United States still enjoyed a clear margin ofnuclear superiority over the Soviet Union.Eisenhower might have been certain of his ability to rein in the Strangelovianfigures in his national security establishment, but his chronic health troublesmade his control of the country’s war apparatus seem questionable at times.Eisenhower, who wrestled with high blood pressure, suffered a heart attack inSeptember 1955 that was more serious than the White House publicly admitted. Hewas not able to return to the Oval Office on a regular basis until January. Asthe sixty-five-year-old Eisenhower debated whether or not to seek reelection in1956, his heart specialist advised that there was a fifty-fifty chance he wouldnot live out a second term—an opinion that was also kept secret. Nine monthsafter his heart attack, Eisenhower was operated on for a painful bowelobstruction and remained hospitalized for three weeks. And in November 1957, thepresident suffered a mild stroke in the Oval Office, which affected his speechand caused severe headaches for weeks. During Eisenhower’s periods ofincapacitation, it was Foster Dulles and Vice President Nixon, the Dullesbrothers’ acolyte, who moved into the presidential power vacuum. Neither man wasknown for his sense of moderation in dealing with Communist adversaries.From the very beginning of the administration, Secretary of State Dulles arguedthat the United States must overcome the “taboo” against nuclear weapons. At aFebruary 1953 National Security Council meeting, just three weeks intoEisenhower’s presidency, Foster raised what he called “the moral problem” thathovered over all nuclear decision-making. He was not referring to the profoundquestions about mass slaughter and human survival. Foster meant the moralrevulsion against doomsday weapons that prevented policy makers from seriouslycontemplating their use.Foster pushed Eisenhower to consider using the ultimate weapons during onecrisis after the next, including the climactic stage of the Korean War in 1953,the final French stand in Vietnam at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, the battle of nerveswith China over the islands of Quemoy and Matsu that same year, and the 1958confrontation with the Soviets over Berlin. At various, hair-raising moments ofthese crises, Eisenhower seemed poised to take Foster’s advice, and was onlydissuaded by the alarmed opposition of allied leaders or the cooler-headedresponses of the Chinese and Soviet governments.John Foster Dulles was the exemplar of Mills’s “crackpot realism.” He was a“wise man” who, in sober and solemn tones, advocated positions that were theheight of madness. “We are at a curious juncture in the history of humaninsanity,” Mills wrote in The Causes of World War III, his 1958 jeremiad againstthe growing fever for the final conflict. “In the name of realism, men are quitemad, and precisely what they call utopian is now the condition of humansurvival.”“Utopian action”—by which Mills meant active diplomacy among the superpowers, aban on nuclear arms testing, a moratorium on the production of “extermination”weapons, scientific and cultural exchanges, and free travel between the West andEast—was actually “realistic, sound, common sense,” he wrote. In contrast,“practical actions are now the actions of madmen and idiots. And yet these mendecide; these men are honored, each in his closed-up nation, as the wise andresponsible leaders of our time who are doing the best they can under tryingcircumstances.”Foster seemed to have a chillingly remote perspective on what it meant to drop anuclear bomb. When the French garrison at Dien Bien Phu was on the verge ofcollapse, he offered to give two “A-bombs” to French foreign minister GeorgesBidault. The French official was deeply shaken by Foster’s blithe offer. Bidaultresponded “without having to do much thinking on the subject.” He pointed out toFoster that “if those bombs are dropped near Dien Bien Phu, our side will sufferas much as the enemy.” Likewise, during the Formosa Strait crisis, Foster wassurprised to learn that the “precision” nuclear bombing of Chinese targets thathe was advocating would kill more than ten million civilians. Still, he was notchastened enough to stop his campaign to “punish” the Chinese.Mills noted that, like the Nazis before them, the national security leaders“rationally” planning for a nuclear holocaust were characterized by a “moralinsensibility.” Official violence had become so bureaucratized that “in officialman there is no more human shock.” Mills believed that humanity would continueto teeter on the brink of the eternal void until Eisenhower’s secretary ofstate, whom he accused of a “doctrinaire and murderous rigidity,” was replacedby a diplomat who was serious about the prospects for peaceful coexistence.The death in March 1953 of Joseph Stalin, the Moloch of Soviet brutality anddespair, offered the Eisenhower administration the opportunity to redefine theU.S. relationship with Moscow, as the Kremlin’s new leaders began the process ofde-Stalinization. But Foster continued to counsel a hard line against theSoviets, interpreting any signs of a Cold War thawing in Moscow as evidence thatthe tough U.S. line was working. The secretary of state even sternly cautionedEisenhower not to smile at Soviet officials or shake hands with them at the July1955 Geneva Summit. This proved difficult for Ike, observed Stewart Alsop, since“his whole instinct was to smile and be friendly. And then he’d kind of drawback, remembering what Foster had said.”Nikita Khrushchev, the canny and down-to-earth political survivor who wasemerging from the Kremlin’s scrum as the top Soviet leader, closely observed thepersonal dynamics between Eisenhower and his secretary of state in Geneva andconcluded that Foster was in charge. “I watched Dulles making notes with apencil, tearing them out of a pad, folding them up, and sliding them underEisenhower’s hand,” Khrushchev later wrote in his memoir. “Eisenhower would pickup these sheets of paper, unfold them, and read them before making a decision onany matter that came up. He followed this routine conscientiously, like adutiful schoolboy taking his lead from his teacher. It was difficult to imaginehow a chief of state could allow himself to lose face like that in front ofdelegates from other countries. It certainly appeared that Eisenhower wasletting Dulles do his thinking for him.”Before jumping on the Eisenhower bandwagon in 1952, the Dulles brotherscalculated that he would not make a strong president. But Ike’s malleabilityoffered its own advantages, in their eyes. As secretary of state, Fostersucceeded in undermining or deflecting every tentative step that the presidentmade toward détente with the Soviet Union. In August 1955, following the GenevaSummit, Foster sent out a long cable to all U.S. diplomatic mission chiefsaround the world, warning that the free world must not let down its guarddespite the air of goodwill wafting out of the conference. “Geneva has certainlycreated problems for the free nations,” he wrote. “For eight years they havebeen held together largely by a cement compounded of fear and a sense of moralsuperiority. Now the fear is diminished and the moral demarcation is somewhatblurred.” The free world must not “relax its vigilance,” he declared, dismissingthe post-Stalin Soviet peace efforts as a “classic Communist maneuver.” Hope wasFoster’s enemy, fear his righteous sword.By 1958, five years into the process of de-Stalinization, Khrushchev wasunderstandably deeply puzzled and frustrated by Washington’s failure todiplomatically engage with his regime. The main obstacle to peace, he rightlyconcluded, was John Foster Dulles.Foster’s staunch resistance to making peace with the Soviets did not reflect aperverse contrariness or extreme anti-Communism. Nor did it suggest his trueassessment of the Soviet threat. His belligerence was strategic. As hisrevealing cable stated, this militant sense of alert was the “cement” that heldtogether the Western alliance. And as Mills pointed out, the “continualpreparation for war” was also the main factor holding together America’s powerelite. Or, in the mordant observation of Randolph Bourne as the United Statesplunged into the epic madness of World War I, “War is the health of the state.”Foster, who always acted in the interests of the American establishment,understood this. It was this permanent war fever that empowered the country’spolitical and military hierarchies and enriched the increasingly militarizedcorporate sector. It was the very lifeblood of this ruling group’sexistence—even if, in the atomic age, it threatened the existence of humanity.The Eisenhower-Dulles foreign policy operated on twin levels of psychic violenceand actual violence. While the secretary of state threatened to evaporate entirepopulations with “tactical” nuclear strikes, the director of centralintelligence actually eliminated individuals around the world whenever they weredeemed to be a threat to national security. Determined to use the CIA moreaggressively than President Truman, who had feared creating an “AmericanGestapo,” Eisenhower unleashed the agency, giving Allen Dulles a license to killthat the spymaster utilized as he saw fit.Years later, in the 1970s, when post-Watergate congressional committees forcedthe CIA to account for its lethal reign under Dulles, the agency tried todownplay its ruthlessness. CIA witnesses testifying before the Church and PikeCommittees insisted that while the agency had targeted foreign leaders such asthe Congo’s Patrice Lumumba, South Vietnam’s Ngo Dinh Diem, Rafael Trujillo ofthe Dominican Republic, and Fidel Castro, its assassins had proved inept or werebeaten to the punch. Assassination, went the CIA line, was simply not the sortof business at which its people excelled. But the agency was being too modest.In truth, the CIA became an effective killing machine under Dulles. Allen Dulleswas an assassination enthusiast throughout his espionage career, from the daysof his involvement in the Operation Valkyrie plot against Hitler onward. Laterin his career, any nationalist leader who seemed a problem for U.S. interestswas viewed as fair game. During the 1957 Suez crisis, as a group of foreignpolicy officials and commentators gathered for dinner at the Washington home ofWalter Lippmann, the conversation turned to Egypt’s defiant leader, Gamal AbdelNasser. One of the guests jested, “Allen, can’t you find an assassin?” To thegroup’s amazement, Dulles took the comment in dead seriousness. “Well, first youwould need a fanatic, a man who’d be willing to kill himself if he were caught,”said the spymaster, puffing thoughtfully on his pipe. “And he couldn’t be anoutsider. He’d have to be an Arab. It would be very difficult to find just theright man.”The Dulles brothers assured multinational firms that Washington would stop atnothing to protect their overseas investments. In August 1956, during yetanother period of upheaval in the Mideast, Foster addressed a private meeting ofoil company officials in Washington. The secretary of state assured the oilmenthat if any sultan or despot were to be as unwise as Mossadegh and try tonationalize his underground desert treasure, the country would soon find itselfthe target of an “international intervention.” Fortunately for Eisenhower, whosought to avoid such costly military operations, his administration would onlyfeel compelled to mount one such intervention, sending the Marines into Lebanonin 1958 to ensure that the Beirut government remained in friendly hands. Therest of America’s imperial mission during the Eisenhower years remained firmlyin the hands of Allen Dulles.Whispers about Dulles’s tactics began making themselves heard in the White Houseduring Eisenhower’s first term. Some of the anxious reports came from thoseWashington circles that took a permanent interest in the nation’s affairs, nomatter which party was in power. Some emanated from within the spy agencyitself. In July 1954, Eisenhower asked a trusted military friend, retired AirForce general James H. Doolittle, a World War II hero, to look into the agencyand give him a confidential report. After Doolittle finished his investigationin October, the president blocked out an afternoon to hear his briefing. Thegeneral told Eisenhower that the CIA was badly managed and that Dulles wasoverly zealous. Furthermore, the relationship between the Dulleses was“unfortunate”—an alliance based on blood that allowed the brothers to establishtheir own, largely unaccountable power center within the administration.Eisenhower responded defensively, insisting that he found the Dulles brother actto be “beneficial.” As for Allen, he might have his peculiarities, conceded thepresident, but the CIA was “one of the most peculiar types of operations anygovernment can have, and it probably takes a strange kind of genius to run it.”Ironically, the Doolittle Report gave Dulles even more justification for hisremorseless shadow war by concluding, “It is now clear that we are facing animplacable enemy whose avowed objective is world domination by whatever meansand at whatever cost. There are no rules in such a game. Hitherto acceptablenorms of human conduct do not apply.” Dulles could not have put it morezealously himself.Dulles’s CIA operated with virtually no congressional oversight. In the Senate,Dulles relied on Wall Street friends like Prescott Bush of Connecticut—thefather and grandfather of two future presidents—to protect the CIA’s interests.According to CIA veteran Robert Crowley, who rose to become second-in-command ofthe CIA’s action arm, Bush “was the day-to-day contact man for the CIA. It wasvery bipartisan and friendly. Dulles felt that he had the Senate just where hewanted them.”The CIA director found the House side of Congress to be equally amenable. Eachyear, Dulles had to go through the formality of making the agency’s budget pitchto the armed services panel of the House Appropriations Committee, which waschaired at that time by Rep. Clarence Cannon of Missouri. On one occasion, theCIA’s congressional liaison Walter Pforzheimer had to track down the elusiveCannon to find out when that year’s CIA budget hearing would be scheduled.Pforzheimer cornered Chairman Cannon in the Capitol’s Statuary Hall, alertingthe congressman to the fact that Dulles would be asking for a 10 percentincrease in the CIA’s budget. “All right, Walter, you tell Mr. Dulles that hehad his hearing and that he got his 10 percent.”Eisenhower was perfectly happy to have Congress stay out of the CIA’s business,fearing a repeat of the McCarthy circus if legislators were allowed to probe theagency’s operations. The president—who didn’t know everything about the agency’sdark side, but knew enough —was also keenly aware of the dangers of suchexposure. “The things we did were ‘covert,’” the president wrote in a diaryentry that was not declassified until 2009. “If knowledge of them became public,we would not only be embarrassed . . . but our chances to do anything of likenature in the future would almost totally disappear.”John Eisenhower, who served his father as a White House aide, later blamed theDulles spy set for manipulating the president. Ike was no match, said theyounger Eisenhower, for the slick Ivy League types at the CIA. “Dad could befooled. He was better when the guy was in uniform and knew him. But all thoseguys from Princeton and Yale . . .” Yet, throughout most of his presidency,Eisenhower was all too willing to be fooled by the CIA. Ike knew that Dulles’s“strange genius” had its uses.In 1956, to appease critics who charged that the CIA was operating withextremely minimal supervision, Eisenhower again ordered a discreet investigationof the agency by national security insiders—this time, diplomat David Bruce andWall Street banker-statesman Robert Lovett. Eisenhower and Dulles felt there wasnothing to fear from this new inspection, since Bruce and Lovett were longtimefriends of the spymaster. But the Bruce-Lovett report shocked Dulles, takingstrong aim at the CIA’s penchant for creating political mayhem around the globe.There was an airy arrogance to Dulles’s “busy, monied and privileged” agency,with its obvious fondness for overseas “kingmaking,” declared the report. Thepromiscuous freedom that had been granted to Dulles and his “extremelyhigh-powered machine” to “go barging around into other countries . . . scaredthe hell out of us,” Lovett later remarked.But, once again, Eisenhower ignored the strong criticisms leveled at the spyagency. Dulles’s operation was simply too essential a component of thepresident’s Cold War strategy for him to rein it in.Unmanaged by the White House and unsupervised by Congress, Dulles’s CIA grew tobecome the most potent agency of the Eisenhower era. Dulles was a master atseeding Washington bureaucracies with agency men, placing his loyalists in toppositions in the Pentagon, State Department, and even the White House. The CIAbecame increasingly intertwined with the armed services, as military officerswere assigned to agency missions, and then sent back to their military posts as“ardent disciples of Allen Dulles,” in the words of Air Force colonel L.Fletcher Prouty, who served as a liaison officer between the Pentagon and theCIA between 1955 and 1963. Prouty, who observed Dulles at close hand, marveledat his mastery of the Washington power game. “He simply worked like the ColoradoRiver in the Grand Canyon; he eroded all opposition.”Late on September 9, 1954, as midnight approached, Jacobo Arbenz, the recentlydeposed president of Guatemala, was escorted into the Guatemala City airportwith a small entourage, including his wife, Maria Vilanova, and two of theirchildren. Arbenz was beloved among his dirt-poor country’s peasants and workersfor his land and labor reforms, but he was reviled by Guatemala’s aristocracy.As he prepared to leave his homeland, Arbenz was showered with abuse by asmartly dressed crowd of several hundred ill-wishers. “Assassin! Thief! Piece ofshit!” they screamed at him as he hurried into the airport terminal with hisfamily.Arbenz was fortunate to make it past the venomous crowd unharmed. Shortly beforehe and his family were driven to the airport, a decoy car masquerading forsecurity purposes as the vehicle actually transporting the Arbenz family wasblown up by his enemies.Howard Hunt, one of the principal CIA orchestrators of the Guatemala coup, lateracknowledged that he had helped organize the hostile send-off party at theairport for the benefit of the press. But Hunt claimed that he had spread theword among his people to let Arbenz leave the country unscathed. He knew that ifthe deposed leader were assassinated, “we’d [the CIA and the United States] getblamed for it.” Relatives of Arbenz later said they found Hunt’s professedconcern for their family’s security “hard to believe,” considering his role inthe Guatemalan president’s violent downfall.Before he was allowed to board the chartered DC-4 waiting to take him to MexicoCity—the first stop in what would turn out to be a permanent exile—Arbenz wassubjected to a final humiliation. Authorities of the new military regimedemanded that the ex-president strip to his underwear in full view of a mob ofjostling reporters and cameramen, ostensibly so that they could make sure he wasnot smuggling out cash. After his traumatic overthrow, Arbenz’s nerves wereshot. He and his family had spent seventy-three days and nights in miserableasylum at the Mexican embassy in Guatemala City, which had become so packed withpolitical refugees that typhus and other diseases had broken out. At theairport, Arbenz looked pale and drawn in the glare of the camera lights. Everytime a flashbulb popped, he visibly flinched. And yet, even as he disrobed infull view of the press pack, he held on to a kind of dignity, his head erect,his eyes looking straight ahead. “It gave the impression that a cold statue wastaking off his marble clothes,” remarked one of the ogling reporters.“They were trying to break him down psychologically,” said Dr. Erick Arbenz, aNew York anesthesiologist and grandson of Jacobo Arbenz, who has led thefamily’s campaign to reclaim his legacy. “Can you think of another example likethis, where the elected leader of a nation was forced to undergo this sort ofhumiliation—to be publicly undressed in front of news cameras? The CIA wasafraid of him—an educated, articulate reformer who had stood up to the localelite and the U.S. government. He was a big threat to these powerful interests.”For the rest of the exiled Guatemalan leader’s life, the CIA was determined tostrip away whatever shred of respectability still clung to him. The agency’sdisinformation campaign began immediately after Arbenz’s downfall, with a streamof stories planted in the press—particularly in Latin America—alleging that hewas a pawn of Moscow, that he was guilty of the wholesale butchery of politicalfoes, that he had raided his impoverished country’s treasury, that he wassexually captivated by the man who was the leader of the Guatemalan CommunistParty. None of it was true.CIA operatives had swarmed the presidential palace after he was ousted,collecting official documents and personal correspondence. They knew everythingabout Arbenz’s private life. They knew about the intricate dynamics of hismarriage, as well as the gruesome details of his father’s suicide, and that hehad once sought treatment for a drinking problem. When their discoveries weren’tsensational enough, they embroidered them and sent them fluttering around theworld.While the CIA did all that it could to ruin Arbenz’s name, the State Departmentpressured foreign governments to give the deposed president and his formerdeputies a chilly reception wherever they turned up. When Mexico City grew tooinhospitable for Arbenz and his family, they tried Switzerland, land of hisfather’s birth. But the Swiss authorities demanded that Arbenz give up hisGuatemalan citizenship, which he refused to do, so the next stop was Paris. Theysettled on the Right Bank; his beautiful daughter Arabella was enchanted by thecity. But every time Arbenz went for a walk, he felt he was being tailed. Whenhe tried to hold a press conference to present his case against the powerful menwho had overthrown him, French authorities threatened to deport his familyunless he canceled the event. Arbenz began drinking again, dwelling on his finaldays in Guatemala, and his fateful exit from the political stage to avoid abloodbath. The tragedy was “trapped in his head,” said one of his friends.To escape the hostile environment in the West, Arbenz fled with his familybehind the Iron Curtain, first to Czechoslovakia and then to the Soviet Union.The howling in the press grew louder: here, at last, was proof of Arbenz’s true,Bolshevik heart. “Finally Arbenz has found asylum in a place that he must love,”crowed the New York World-Telegram and Sun, when he first alighted in Prague, “aland from the Iron Curtain where they practice the same sort of democraticregime as his.” Newspapers around the world sounded the same refrain, as if allfollowing the same conductor.In fact, Arbenz’s misery continued unabated behind the Iron Curtain. He hatedthe cold and sunless days; he missed the lush colors and radiance of thetropics. And he soon discovered that he had replaced one system of surveillancewith another. Arbenz had only ended up in Russia because no other country wantedhim. He reached out to every leader in Latin America, but the State Departmenthad made it clear that any nation that took in the top men from the Arbenzgovernment would incur Washington’s wrath. Finally, Uruguay agreed to hostArbenz, but he was informed that he could not speak out, teach, publish hiswriting, or even take a job. He was, during his Montevideo sojourn, theinvisible man.But Arbenz still loomed large in the eyes of the CIA. Howard Hunt, who by thenhad taken over as the agency’s chief of station in Uruguay, continued to closelytrack the man he had driven into exile. A neighbor of the Arbenz family toldthem that their house seemed to be under constant watch from a black car parkedon the corner. Making the surveillance even easier for the CIA, Arbenz and hisfamily had been installed on the same street where Hunt himself lived. Someevenings, Hunt and his wife even showed up at the same restaurant where theArbenzes dined.In 1960, Arbenz was invited to Cuba, and at last he and Maria felt they hadfound a safe place to raise their children. He was energized by therevolutionary fervor on the island, which was still luxuriating in the glory ofits historic accomplishment. Arbenz was allowed to be a public man again,invited to speak at political rallies and to the Cuban press. But everywhereArbenz went, he heard the militant slogan: “Cuba is not Guatemala!” His downfallhad become a cautionary tale.“After the Bay of Pigs, Cuban officials would compare my grandfather’s defeat tothe heroic Cuban victory over the U.S.,” said Erick Arbenz. “He was used forpropaganda purposes, to build up the esteem of the Cuban people. It washumiliating for him.”The Arbenzes met with Fidel Castro, to see if they could find a place forthemselves in the new Cuba. Arbenz suggested that he could teach at theUniversity of Havana, but the Cuban authorities were as leery of the formerGuatemalan leader’s democratic politics as the CIA was. During his Cuban exile,Arbenz grew increasingly disenchanted with the island’s Communist rule. Thefamily was moved into a small house in Varadero, a resort town safely removedfrom the political action in Havana.The charge of cowardice had haunted Arbenz from the moment he surrendered hisoffice. A young Argentinian doctor named Che Guevara—who had come to Guatemalato help the bold Arbenz experiment in progressive democracy—was among those whoimplored the besieged president to arm the people, when Arbenz’s army officersbegan to melt around him under pressure from the CIA. But the Guatemalan leaderwas no Che or Fidel—he had lacked the cold-blooded courage to plunge his countryinto civil war. “My grandfather knew that the peasants were not trained tofight—so arming them would have just resulted in a bloody mess,” said Arbenz’sgrandson. “He loved Guatemala and its people too much to do that.”Arbenz’s beloved daughter, Arabella, refused to stay with the rest of the familyin Cuba. Tired of their endless search for sanctuary, she fled back to Paris andbegan to create her own life—and her own tragedy. Arabella’s beauty launched heron a modeling career and even landed her a movie role. She fell in love with afamous matador, who was equally celebrated for his many romances. Their stormylove affair provided the international press with another sensational Arbenzstory to pursue. One day in 1965, after arguing loudly in a café in Bogotá,Colombia, Arabella rushed outside, returning soon after with a gun. She pointedit first at the matador, and then she stuck it in her mouth and pulled thetrigger.“The family had been hounded all over the world—they were suffering frompost-traumatic stress because of their ordeal,” said Erick Arbenz. “On top ofthat, there was a history of depression on my grandfather’s side.”Arbenz was never the same after the death of his twenty-five-year-old daughter.She had been his special one, the child with whom he had clashed the most andloved the most. The press was merciless, portraying him as a cold and remotefather, a man who had sacrificed the well-being of his children on the altar ofhis ideals. When Arbenz and his family were forced to run the ugly gauntlet atthe Guatemala airport, he had told his children, “Don’t be afraid, keep yourchins up. We’ll get through this.” But, in the end, he could not protect them.Arabella was buried in Mexico, and the Mexican government allowed the family torelocate there. Arbenz still struggled to find a means of support, and Maria,forced to become the family’s provider, had to fly frequently to El Salvador,where her father had business interests. In his later years, Arbenz was anincreasingly forlorn figure. He frequently visited Arabella’s grave; it seemedas if he, too, belonged more in the world of shadows. But he continued to holdon to the dream of one day returning to Guatemala.All that ended in January 1971, when Jacobo Arbenz died a strange and lonelydeath at age fifty-seven in the bathtub of a Mexico City hotel room. Authoritiessaid he had climbed into a tub filled with scalding hot water and had eitherburned to death or drowned. He reportedly had been drinking. But Maria Arbenzalways believed that her husband had been assassinated. In later years, it wasrevealed that the CIA had compiled a list of assassination targets during theplanning for the 1954 coup. Arbenz’s family was convinced that the agency wasstill working its way through the list when the former president suffered histerrible end.What had Jacobo Arbenz done to deserve such a heartbreaking journey throughlife—a tale of grief and lament out of a Gabriel García Márquez novel? Simplyput, he had tried to uplift his people. In doing so, he defied the gods of hiscountry, the almighty United Fruit Company and its powerful friends inWashington, as well as Guatemala’s medieval land barons. In June 1952, Arbenzpushed a sweeping land reform bill through his nation’s legislature aimed atredistributing the heavily rural country’s farm acreage, 70 percent of which wasin the hands of 2 percent of the landowners. Among the properties expropriatedunder the new law and handed over to poor farmers were some of the vast estatesof United Fruit.Until Arbenz’s election in 1950, the giant company, whose operations sprawledthroughout the Caribbean, ran Guatemala less like a banana republic than abanana colony. United Fruit not only owned huge plantations but almost everymile of railroad track in the country, the only major Atlantic port, and thetelephone system. In the capital, rulers came and went at the whim of thecompany. One of Arbenz’s more cold-blooded predecessors, Jorge Ubico, thought ofpeasants as nothing more than beasts of burden. Before the 1944 revolt thattoppled his dictatorship—an uprising that Arbenz had helped lead—farm workerswere roped together like animals by Ubico’s army and delivered to plantationswhere they were forced to work in debt slavery to the landowners.Jacobo and Maria Arbenz were the Kennedys of Guatemala’s fledglingdemocracy—young, rich, good-looking, and dedicated to improving the lives oftheir people. Jacobo, the son of a Swiss immigrant father and a mixed-raceladina mother, had overcome a sad childhood, including the suicide of hisfather, to become a rising officer in the Guatemalan army. He met his striking,dark-eyed wife, the daughter of a wealthy Salvadoran coffee plantation owner, ata dance while she was visiting Guatemala in 1938. The twenty-three-year-oldMaria—who had been educated at a Catholic women’s college in California and wholoved to read and paint—was more cultured than the young lieutenant. But attwenty-five, Jacobo Arbenz cut a dashing picture in his uniform, with a nobleprofile that called to mind F. Scott Fitzgerald. He had a solemn and thoughtfulair about him that lent him a gravity beyond his years.Maria had been born “between silk sheets,” in her words, but she had never beencomfortable with the way that her family’s privileges were built on the backs ofher father’s campesinos. Jacobo, who had been raised by an indigenous nanny, wassimilarly sensitive to the suffering of Guatemala’s native population. WhenMaria asked Jacobo what he would like to do with his life, he answered withgreat sincerity, “I would like to be a reformer.”They married a few months later, and their home became an oasis of enlightenmentin backward Guatemala. The promising young officer and his rich, charming wifefelt more comfortable in the company of reform-minded professors, artists, andeven young Communists than they did with members of the local aristocracy, whodid not invite the couple to their social functions. “But what did we care?”Maria later remarked. “They were parasites—like in El Salvador. I wanted tobroaden my horizons. I hadn’t come to Guatemala to be a socialite and playbridge or golf.”Jacobo and Maria Arbenz proved to be a dynamic match. She encouraged his boldentrance into Guatemalan politics in 1944, when he helped lead the plot tooverthrow the tyrannical Ubico. She fed his hunger for more learning by givinghim a feast of books, from Emerson to Marx. Their vision for Guatemala becamemore ambitious, and dangerously radical by the authoritarian standards of thebanana colony.As Guatemala made the transition to democracy following the 1944 revolt, Arbenzgot increasingly involved in political affairs. In 1950, he decided to run forpresident, focusing his campaign on agrarian reform, which he knew was the keyto his country’s liberation. He consulted with Maria’s brother, Tonio, who wasan agricultural expert, with a progressive Mexican economist, and with youngleaders of the Guatemalan Communist Party whom he had come to respect as some ofthe most dedicated and intelligent agents of change in the country. Together,they formulated a plan for sweeping land reform and social progress inGuatemala.After her husband’s presidential victory, Maria Arbenz came under fire from hisenemies as an evil influence over the newly elected Guatemalan president—abeguiling, Communist-leaning sorceress. But Arbenz ignored the poisonouspolitical chatter and allowed his well-informed wife to participate in cabinetmeetings. She soon established herself as one of his top advisers.The land reform bill that the new president hammered out and then usheredthrough the legislature two years later was relatively moderate—Arbenz’sgovernment only expropriated acreage from United Fruit’s huge holdings that wasnot under cultivation, and it offered the multinational corporation faircompensation for the seized land. But by Guatemala’s retrogressive standards,Arbenz’s land redistribution measures were breathtakingly bold. Many of thepolitical colleagues in Arbenz’s reform faction feared that he had gone too far,and that he would trigger a terrible backlash from the superpower to the north.Their fears were well founded.The powerful influence of the United Fruit Company could be felt throughoutWashington, where the company had high-placed friends and stockholders in bothparties. The company’s advocates were scattered throughout Congress and theforeign policy establishment. One would have to go far back in time, to theseventeenth and eighteenth centuries—when the Dutch East India Company ruled afar-flung empire, with the power to make war, negotiate treaties, hang convicts,and mint its own money—to find another corporation that wielded such clout.United Fruit was especially well connected to the Eisenhower administration. Asthe agribusiness giant began lobbying the White House to overthrow Arbenz,Walter Bedell “Beetle” Smith, the president’s trusted friend and undersecretaryof state, was seeking an executive position with the company. After the coup, hewas named to United Fruit’s board of directors. Henry Cabot Lodge, who arguedthe United Fruit case against Arbenz as Eisenhower’s UN ambassador, belonged toone of the blue-blooded Boston families whose fortunes were long entwined withthe banana company. John Moors Cabot, who was in charge of Latin Americanaffairs at the State Department, was the brother of United Fruit’s former chiefexecutive. Even the president’s personal secretary, Ann Whitman, was connectedto United Fruit: her husband was the company’s public relations director. ButUnited Fruit had no more powerful friends in the administration than the Dullesbrothers.The Dulleses had served as United Fruit’s lawyers from their earliest days atSullivan and Cromwell. On the eve of World War I, young Foster made a discreettour of Central America on behalf of United Fruit, which was growing concernedabout labor unrest and creeping Bolshevism in its tropical empire. Uponreturning from his corporate spy mission, Foster made a confidential report tohis uncle, Robert Lansing, who was not only a former counsel for United Fruitbut President Woodrow Wilson’s secretary of state.Allen became so frequent a visitor to Guatemala as a legal envoy for UnitedFruit that he began taking along Clover, who fell under the spell of thecountry’s beauty and culture. The couple’s Tudor-style home on Long Island’sNorth Shore was adorned with colorful native fabrics and rugs they brought backfrom their trips to the banana colony, giving their otherwise ordinary residencea surprisingly exotic touch. But Dulles’s interest in Guatemalan artifacts didnot extend to the people who had produced them.United Fruit’s cries of alarm about Arbenz’s land reform soon produced the sameresults that Anglo-Iranian Oil’s protestations did in Iran. TheEisenhower-Dulles administration moved swiftly to isolate Guatemala, labeling ita Soviet “beachhead” in the hemisphere. The Arbenz government, Foster charged,was imposing a “Communist-type reign of terror” on the Guatemalan people.Ambassador John Peurifoy, the Dulles brothers’ handpicked man in Guatemala,tried to bribe Arbenz to fall in line, offering him $2 million to abort his landreforms. When that tried-and-true tactic of winning over Latin dictators did notsucceed, Arbenz was physically threatened. And when that, too, failed topersuade the resolute leader, the Dulles brothers began arranging for hisremoval.The CIA found a disgruntled, exiled Guatemalan colonel named Carlos CastilloArmas, who was working as a furniture salesman in Honduras at the time, to leadthe uprising against Arbenz. His revolutionary “army” turned out to be a ragtagband of mercenaries and other unsavory types. Castillo Armas led his motleyforce across the border into Guatemala, driving a battered station wagon. Thereal threats to Arbenz’s presidency came from the sporadic bombing raids on thecapital carried out by CIA pilots, which sowed panic among the population, andfrom the agency’s successful campaign to subvert the Guatemalan military. Onearmy commander reportedly was paid $60,000 to surrender his troops.When Arbenz realized that his army officers could not be counted on to obey hisorders to defend the capital, he knew the game was over. Unwilling to take tothe mountains to lead a guerrilla resistance, like the one that would makehistory in Cuba’s Sierra Maestre, Arbenz began the long and winding descent thatwould end in a Mexico City hotel bathroom.On June 27, 1954, as he prepared to flee the presidential palace, he made afinal radio broadcast, denouncing the “fire and death” that had been rained uponGuatemala by United Fruit and its allies in “U.S. ruling circles.” Few of hisfellow citizens heard Arbenz’s farewell address: in a last act of sabotage aimedat his government, the CIA jammed the radio speech. As he signed off, Arbenzdeclared with certainty that—despite his personal downfall—the cause of progressin Guatemala would triumph. The social accomplishments of the past few years, heinsisted, could not be undone. History would prove him terribly wrong.After Arbenz was overthrown, Dulles assembled his Guatemala task force in theWhite House to brief the president on the victorious operation, which had beenconfidently code-named PBSUCCESS. Less than one year after the Iran coup, theCIA director and his team had won a second opportunity to puff out their chests.PBSUCCESS would forge deep, lifelong bonds among Dulles and his Guatemala crew,which included Richard Bissell, Tracy Barnes, Howard Hunt, David Phillips, andDavid Morales. Many of the team members would be reunited for the Bay of Pigs.In later years, some of the Guatemala veterans would again pop into thespotlight under even more notorious circumstances.But when they filed into the East Wing theater for their Guatemala slideshow,the PBSUCCESS team was at the height of its glory. The room was filled with theadministration’s top dignitaries, including the president himself, his cabinet,and the vice president. Afterward, Eisenhower, ever the soldier, asked Dulleshow many men he had lost. Just one, Dulles told him. “Incredible!” exclaimed thepresident.But the real body count in Guatemala started after the invasion, when theCIA-backed regime of Castillo Armas began to “clean” the nation of politicalundesirables, labor organizers, and peasants who had too eagerly embracedArbenz’s land reforms. It was the beginning of a blood-soaked era that wouldtransform Guatemala into one of the twentieth century’s most infamous killingfields. The “stainless” coup, as some of its CIA engineers liked to call it,would actually result in a tide of gore, including assassinations, rampanttorture and executions, death squad mayhem, and the massacres of entirevillages. By the time that the bloodletting had run its course, four decadeslater, over 250,000 people had been killed in a nation whose total populationwas less than four million when the reign of terror began.The U.S. press coverage of the Guatemala coup offered a sanitized account, onethat smacked of CIA manipulation. The leading newspapers treated the overthrowof Arbenz’s government as a tropical adventure, an “opéra bouffe,” in the wordsof Hanson Baldwin, one of Dulles’s trusted friends at The New York Times.Nonetheless, reported Baldwin, the operation had “global importance.” This isprecisely how Dulles liked his overseas exploits to be chronicled—asentertaining espionage capers, with serious consequences for the Cold Warstruggle. New York Times publisher Arthur Hays Sulzberger was extremelyaccommodating to Dulles throughout the covert operation, agreeing to keepforeign correspondent Sydney Gruson, whom Dulles considered insufficientlycompliant, out of Guatemala and even assuring the CIA director that Gruson’sfuture articles would be screened “with a great deal more care than usual.”The strangely lighthearted tone of U.S. news dispatches about Guatemala wouldseep into history books about the CIA and Dulles biographies for years. But, intruth, Guatemala was less opéra bouffe than Le Théâtre du Grand-Guignol.The murderous intrigue began long before the actual coup. As early as January1952, the CIA started plotting to eliminate the top officials of the Arbenzgovernment. Howard Hunt might have wanted to avoid the embarrassment of anArbenz assassination in full public view, but the CIA had no qualms aboutcompiling a secret “disposal list” of at least fifty-eight key Guatemalanleaders during the planning for the coup. The assassination memo was amongseveral hundred documents relating to the 1954 coup released by the CIA in 1997during one of the agency’s occasional exercises in carefully managed “openness,”which one critic labeled “a brilliant public relations snow job.” Still, thedocuments were revealing enough to send shock waves through the internationalpress.In one of the declassified documents, an unnamed CIA official expressed hisconfidence on the eve of the Guatemala coup that “the elimination of those inhigh positions of the [Arbenz] government would bring about its collapse.”Another document—a chillingly detailed, nineteen-page CIA killing manual titled“A Study of Assassination”—offered the most efficient ways to butcherGuatemala’s leadership. “The simplest tools are often the most efficient meansof assassination,” the manual helpfully suggested. “A hammer, axe, wrench, screwdriver, fire poker, kitchen knife, lamp stand, or anything hard, heavy and handywill suffice.” The manual also advised assassins which parts of the body tostrike for the most lethal effect, noting that “puncture wounds of the bodycavity may not be reliable unless the heart is reached. . . . Absolutereliability is obtained by severing the spinal cord in the cervical region.” Theauthors of the manual did make a passing reference to the morality of killingelected leaders of a sovereign nation. “Murder is not morally justified,” themanual briefly acknowledged. “Persons who are morally squeamish should notattempt it.”The CIA compiled its death list with bureaucratic diligence, circulating thenames of those nominated to die within agency departments and among Guatemala’smilitary plotters, and asking for comments (as well as suggestions for the namesof additional targets) like an interoffice memo. Because the CIA deleted thenames on the list when it declassified the document, there is no way to tell howmany—or if any—of the fifty-eight or more prominent Guatemalans were eventuallyassassinated. But what is known is that by training and encouraging Guatemala’snew military masters in the art of political murder, the CIA injected a deathspore into the nation’s bloodstream that would wreak havoc for decades.As soon as the dictator Castillo Armas was installed in the presidential palace,the CIA began pressuring him to purge Guatemala of leftist elements. His armyrounded up some four thousand suspected Communists. As they revealed underinterrogation, few of the prisoners had ever heard of Karl Marx and nonebelonged to the Communist Party—but they were guilty of belonging to democraticpolitical parties, labor unions, and farmworker associations. They all had beeninfected with dangerous ideas during the Arbenz era because, in the words of oneobserver, “they believed [that] in a democracy the people chose the government,Guatemala needed land reform, and workers deserved protection under the law.”For the rest of his regime, Castillo Armas would do everything in his power topurify Guatemala of these thoughts. The CIA, enamored of making ominous lists,helped the new regime assemble a lista negra of subversives that soon grew toseventy thousand names. Eventually the names on the blacklist amounted to astaggering 10 percent of the country’s adult population. Many of the names camefrom the Arbenz government documents that the CIA had seized when it raided thepresidential palace. In August 1954, Castillo Armas announced Decree 59—thebeginning of Guatemala’s fascist legal architecture—which gave his regime theright to arrest those on the blacklist and to hold them for up to six monthswithout trial. Those unfortunate enough to be rounded up were put in the care ofJosé Bernabé Linares, the notorious chief of the Guardia Judicial, who was knownfor extracting confessions from prisoners with electric-shock baths and steelskullcaps.Guatemalan journalists who attempted to report on the regime’s abuses werethemselves thrown into prison and tortured. But as Castillo Armas consolidatedhis brutal reign, with the CIA’s energetic support, the U.S. embassy inGuatemala City continued to cover for the regime, insisting that there was“little basis for apprehension that the country could become a harsh policestate very soon.”Meanwhile, the barbarism spread to the countryside, where peasant leaders weresummarily executed, setting the stage for Guatemala’s future death squads.Exiles reported that the regime was encouraging the rise of vigilante groups,telling them, “You can go and rob and kill in such-and-such sector, at thisaddress, and you can be sure there won’t be any police around to bother youabout it.” The worst massacre at the time took place in Tiquisate, a center offarmworker activism, where as many as a thousand peasants were seized bysoldiers from plantations owned by United Fruit and local despots, lined up, andmachine-gunned into open trenches.Castillo Armas’s own bloody end came in July 1957, when he was assassinated byone of his own palace guards. But his death did nothing to abate the slaughter,which continued on and off for decades, reaching new heights of ferocity duringthe Reagan presidency. One of the military dictators who succeeded CastilloArmas vowed, “If it is necessary to turn the country into a cemetery in order topacify it, I will not hesitate to do so.”The enormous suffering of the Guatemalan people weighed heavily on Jacobo andMaria Arbenz during their long exile. “It haunted my grandparents every day,”said Erick Arbenz. “That was another reason there was so much depression in ourfamily. They lived and felt the Guatemala holocaust every day. They had tried tobring about a Guatemala Spring—and then to suffer not only their own defeat, butto see everything that was done to their people . . . it was an overwhelmingtragedy.”The anguish of the Arbenz family seemed to have no end. In 2004, the Arbenzes’other daughter, Maria Leonora, followed the path of her sister and killedherself. “She felt as if she were being pursued and persecuted her whole life,”said Erick. “Those feelings never went away from her.”After the Eisenhower administration overthrew Jacobo Arbenz, U.S. officialsboasted that they would turn Guatemala into “a showcase for democracy.” Itbecame, instead, a bottomless well of sorrow."},{"pageContent":"11 [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-27]STRANGE LOVE [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-27]The 1951 World Series was an epic sports event. The “subway series” not onlyfeatured two exciting New York teams, the Yankees and the Giants, but it markedthe climax of what became known as “The Season of Change.” Joe DiMaggio, thelegendary “Yankee Clipper,” would bow out of baseball after the series. And twoyoung future Hall of Famers—Yankees rookie Mickey Mantle and Giants rookieWillie Mays—would make their World Series debuts. The twenty-year-old Mays, whoidolized DiMaggio, finally had a chance to exchange a few words with his herowhen photographers urged the two sluggers to stand together for a picture. “Itwas a dream come true,” said the rookie, who played the series in a daze.Game 6, which was played on October 10 in front of nearly sixty-two thousandpeople in Yankee Stadium, would assume mythic proportions in baseball fans’memories. The Yankees withstood a thrilling ninth-inning comeback charge by theGiants, winning the game 4–3 and taking the series. As DiMaggio trotted off thefield to the roar of the crowd, he was already fading into history. “I’ve playedmy last game,” Joltin’ Joe told his teammates, who gathered around him in thelocker room, handing him baseballs, bats, and other mementoes for him to sign.At thirty-six, DiMaggio’s body was failing him and he didn’t want to let downhis fans and fellow players. “He quit because he wasn’t Joe DiMaggio anymore,”his brother Tom later said.Among those sitting in the stands on that bittersweet day at Yankee Stadium weretwo well-dressed German gentlemen in their forties, accompanied by a younger manwho was their CIA handler. Like DiMaggio, the older German, Reinhard Gehlen, wasa legendary figure, but his achievements were of a completely different order.Gehlen did not look like an imposing figure. He was slightly built and had areceding hairline, brush mustache, and ears that were as sharply peaked as abat’s. His skin was so pale that it seemed “translucent” to his CIA companion.Only his striking blue eyes gave any indication of the intense ambition that haddriven Gehlen throughout his career.During the war, Gehlen had served as Hitler’s intelligence chief on the easternfront. His Foreign Armies East (Fremde Heere Ost) apparatus relentlessly probedfor weaknesses in the Soviet defenses as the Nazi juggernaut made its eastwardthrust. Gehlen’s FHO also pinpointed the location of Jews, Communists, and otherenemies of the Reich in the “bloodlands” overrun by Hitler’s forces, so theycould be rounded up and executed by the Einsatzgruppen death squads. Most of theintelligence gathered by Gehlen’s men was extracted from the enormous populationof Soviet prisoners of war—which eventually totaled four million—that fell underNazi control. Gehlen’s exalted reputation as an intelligence wizard, which wonhim the Führer’s admiration and his major general’s rank, derived from hisorganization’s widespread use of torture.Though many in the Yankee Stadium crowd that day would have been deeplydispleased to learn Gehlen’s identity, the German spymaster, wearing histrademark dark glasses, sat undisturbed in the stands, enjoying the carnivalexuberance of the afternoon. The game itself was of little interest to Gehlen—itwas his German companion, Heinz Herre, who was the rabid baseball fan. Herre,who had served as Gehlen’s indispensable deputy ever since their days togetheron the eastern front, became so enamored of America’s favorite pastime after thewar that he could spit out players’ statistics like the most obsessive ofbaseball card collectors. During the war, Herre had studied the Soviet enemywith equal intensity, learning the Russian language and immersing himself in thecountry’s politics and culture. Now his compulsive curiosity was focused on allthings American.Herre, a tall and lean man with an appealing smile, had a knack for ingratiatinghimself with his U.S. colleagues. Though the socially awkward Gehlen lacked hisdeputy’s facility with Americans, he knew it was an essential skill. In thefinal days of the war, Gehlen astutely concluded that the U.S.-Soviet alliancewould inevitably break apart, providing an opportunity for at least someelements of the Nazi hierarchy to survive by joining forces with the Westagainst Moscow. He knew that his own fate depended on his ability to convincehis new American masters of his strategic value in the emerging Cold War. Gehlendid this by trekking into the Bavarian mountains, as U.S. forces approached, andburying cases of microfilm containing Nazi intelligence on the Soviet Union. TheGerman spymaster then leveraged his expertise and underground connections inEastern Europe, convincing U.S. military officials of his indispensability as anauthority on the Soviet threat.Gehlen’s canny maneuvers won him and his top staff a flight out of war-ravagedGermany on a DC-3 military transport to the United States, where they were movedinto comfortable quarters at Fort Hunt in Virginia. Here Gehlen was introducedto his American intelligence counterparts, including Allen Dulles, who, afterlistening to the German spymaster’s pitch, decided that the U.S. governmentshould bring the former Nazi intelligence operation under its supervision.Instead of being handed over to the Soviets as war criminals, as Moscow wasdemanding, Gehlen and his top deputies were put on a troop ship back to Germany.Back home, Gehlen’s spy team was installed by U.S. military authorities in acompound in the village of Pullach, near Munich, that had once served as theheadquarters of Hitler confidante Martin Bormann. Gehlen’s dream ofreconstituting Hitler’s military intelligence structure within the U.S. nationalsecurity system was about to be realized. With the generous support of theAmerican government, the Gehlen Organization—as it came to be known—thrived inPullach, becoming West Germany’s principal intelligence agency.In 1948, after a heated internal debate, the CIA decided to take oversupervision of the Gehlen Organization from the U.S. Army, which had growingconcerns about the type of agents Gehlen was recruiting and the quality of theirintelligence work. Gehlen had promised Army officials that he would not hireformer SS or Gestapo officials. But as his organization grew, it absorbed someof the most notorious figures of the Nazi regime, such as Dr. Franz Six. Aformer professor at Berlin University, Six left the classroom to become anintellectual architect of the Final Solution as well as one of its mostenthusiastic enforcers, personally leading an SS death squad on the easternfront. After the war, Six was hired by the Gehlen Organization but was laterarrested by U.S. Army counterintelligence agents. Convicted of war crimes, Sixserved four years in prison. However, within weeks of his release, Six was backat work in Gehlen’s Pullach headquarters.Many in the CIA vehemently opposed any association with such a stigmatizedorganization, including Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter, the agency’s firstdirector, who in 1947 strongly urged President Truman to “liquidate” Gehlen’soperation. The following year, the CIA station chief in Karlsruhe, Germany,expressed his own disgust at the prospect of a merger with Gehlen’s group,calling it an old boy’s network of ex-Nazi officers “who are in a position toprovide safe haven for a good many undesirable elements from the standpoint of afuture democratic Germany.” But Gehlen had his influential supporters inWashington.Gehlen’s backing came primarily from the Dulles faction within the nationalsecurity establishment—and once again, this faction would prevail. In October1948, James Critchfield, the new chief of the CIA’s Munich station, was giventhe task of evaluating Gehlen’s operation and recommending for or against it.The thirty-one-year-old Critchfield was a Dulles man: he had been identified asa talented prospect by Eleanor Dulles while serving with Army intelligence inpostwar Vienna, and he was later recruited into the CIA by her brothers. In hisfinal report, Critchfield firmly concluded that the CIA should fold Gehlen’sgroup under its wing. It was the beginning of a fateful relationship that wouldshape Cold War politics for decades to come.The CIA officially assumed responsibility for the German spy organization inJuly 1949, with Jim Critchfield taking over as Gehlen’s supervisor. Critchfieldmoved his base of operations to Pullach, setting up his office in Bormann’sformer bedroom. Gehlen had turned Pullach into its own separate world, with overtwo hundred of his top staff and their wives and children living and working inthe compound. Before Critchfield moved in, the German spymaster himself hadlived with his wife and four children in Bormann’s two-story house. Known,ironically, as the “White House,” its décor still retained touches of Nazikitsch, including a stone German eagle looming over the front door, whose clawswere now empty after U.S. soldiers chiseled away the swastika they once held.As Critchfield’s CIA deputies and their families moved into Gehlen’s gatedcommunity, an intimate social fusion began to develop between the formerenemies. The Germans and Americans worked and partied together, their childrenattended the same one-room school, and their families even went on ski tripstogether in the nearby Bavarian Alps. By 1953, the CIA and Gehlen Organizationwere so entwined in Germany that some Washington officials, including DeputySecretary of Defense Roger Keyes, expressed strong concern.Just a few years before, Gehlen and his top men—who included high-rankingofficers of the German General Staff, FHO, and even SS—had been dedicatedwarriors of the Third Reich. And yet Critchfield convinced himself that, exceptfor “some borderline cases [who] worked in peripheral areas of the organization. . . [Gehlen’s] key people . . . had come out of the war and the NurembergTrials with reasonably clean slates.”Critchfield was the son of a small-town North Dakota doctor and schoolteacher,graduating from North Dakota State University and joining the Army on the eve ofthe war. He had the thick, wavy hair and dark good looks of a central castingmilitary hero. Critchfield served in North Africa and Europe, rising through theranks to become one of the Army’s youngest colonels and winning the Bronze Startwice and the Silver Star for gallantry. Crossing the Rhine in the final weeksof the war as the commander of a mobile task force, the young colonel was one ofthe first American officers to witness firsthand the results of Hitler’s FinalSolution. In late April, his unit came across an annex of Dachau. The camp wasnearly empty, but there was evidence all around of the horror that had takenplace there. At one point, the young Army colonel and his soldiers watched in“shocked silence” as two skeletal camp survivors chased after an escaping SSguard, wrestled him to the ground, and choked him to death.Despite his war experiences, Critchfield prided himself on keeping an open mindabout the ex-Nazi commanders with whom he later worked. “Gehlen and his seniorstaff, and their wives (many of whom also worked in Pullach), all impressed usas being unusually intelligent and well educated,” Critchfield observed. “Inpersonal characteristics, apparent values, and thoughts about the future ofGermany and Europe, these [ex-Nazi] officers did not seem to me significantlydifferent from my contemporaries in the U.S. Army.”Critchfield knew from the beginning of his professional relationship with Gehlenthat he was dealing with a “difficult personality.” Gehlen once subjected hisCIA supervisor to a three-hour “harangue” against U.S. interference in his spyorganization’s affairs. Despite Gehlen’s occasional histrionics, Critchfieldexpressed admiration for his German colleague’s pragmatic, businesslike styleand his welcome habit of “getting right to the point.” If Gehlen had not beenrescued by U.S. intelligence authorities after the war, he almost certainlywould have been convicted of war crimes at Nuremberg. But Critchfield graciouslyoverlooked Gehlen’s past. “He had a high standard of morality,” Critchfieldlater observed, without a hint of irony, “with Christian beliefs that wereevident and reinforced by his wife Herta and their family.” This simple,trusting American attitude made Critchfield an easy mark for Gehlen and theother quick-witted Nazi veterans whom he supervised.Reinhard Gehlen was a man of ratlike cunning. He had managed to work his way upthrough the Wehrmacht’s intelligence hierarchy; to survive a falling-out withHitler late in the war over his increasingly dire intelligence reports; and notonly to avoid the hangman’s noose at Nuremberg but to persuade the Americans togive him a leading role in their shadow war against the Soviet Union. Hisoverriding goal was to rebuild the Nazi power network and return Germany to adominant role on the European stage. Gehlen harbored deeply mixed feelings aboutGermany’s American conquerors; he had a cringing respect for their power andmoney but was deeply resentful about being forced to answer to them. He oftentreated his handlers, including Critchfield, more as enemies than allies,keeping them in the dark about his operations and even putting them undersurveillance.Late in his life, Critchfield admitted to a Washington Post reporter, “There’sno doubt that the CIA got carried away with recruiting some pretty bad people.”In a secret 1954 memo, later declassified, the agency acknowledged that at least13 percent of the Gehlen Organization was made up of former hard-core Nazis.But, to the end of his life, Critchfield insisted that Gehlen was not one ofthese “bad people.”“I’ve lived with this for [nearly] 50 years,” Critchfield told the Post in 2001.“Almost everything negative that has been written about Gehlen, in which he hasbeen described as an ardent ex-Nazi, one of Hitler’s war criminals—this is allfar from the fact.”Happily deluded about Gehlen’s true character, Critchfield worked hard todevelop a good rapport with the German spymaster throughout their six-yearpartnership at Pullach. It was Critchfield who arranged the trip to America forGehlen and his alter ego Heinz Herre in the fall of 1951, highlighted by thefinal game of the World Series. Gehlen’s CIA caretaker saw the Americanodyssey—which was scheduled to include high-level meetings in Washington, aswell as a train trip west to California—as a way to cement the agency’srelationship with the cagey German and strengthen his bond with America.As Critchfield put together the itinerary for Gehlen and Herre, the CIAhierarchy realized that the Germans’ trip was fraught with potential problems.Gehlen remained a controversial figure within U.S. national security circles,where some were still pushing to fire him. An October 1950 CIA report on Gehlen,remarking on his tendency to throw fits and make demands on his Americanoverseers, dismissed the German as “a runt, and, even as runts go, a ratherunimpressive one . . . he suffers from a ‘runt complex.’” A flurry ofinteroffice CIA memos on the eve of Gehlen’s U.S. junket fretted that “his tripcan obviously produce a variety of political embarrassments” and predicted that“Gehlen will be somewhat difficult to control on this trip.”In the end, the trip was a triumph for Gehlen and his supporters in the CIA.After Gehlen and Herre arrived in New York on September 23, 1951, Critchfieldescorted them on their railway tour of America. On their way to the West Coast,they stopped over in Chicago, dropping by a 1930s-era speakeasy one night where,“much to the surprise of all of us,” recounted Critchfield, “we were greeted bya famous member of the Mafia.” As they rolled westward on the rails, the threemen shed their business skins and eased into the lazy pace of tourists. But theGermans could not drop all their espionage training. “We looked out on theRockies from the top of Pike’s Peak and walked among the great redwoods outsideSan Francisco,” recalled Critchfield. “Gehlen was an insatiable photographer andHerre, like the General Staff officer that he was, equipped himself with mapsand sought out the highest observation point for surveying each touristobjective.”Returning to Washington, D.C., on October 8, they checked into a suite at theEnvoy, an ornate, old-world hotel in the leafy Adams Morgan neighborhood. Dullesarranged for Gehlen and Herre to meet with CIA director Beetle Smith. Dulleshosted a private dinner at the Metropolitan Club for the Germans and several CIAofficers with whom they felt comfortable, including Richard Helms, who had runU.S. intelligence operations in Germany after the war.The 1951 trip to America sealed the relationship between “UTILITY,” as Gehlenwas code-named by the Americans, and the CIA. Over the years, the agency wouldoccasionally wrestle with its conscience over the alliance. But CIA officialsinvariably suppressed these doubts and moved on. In 1954, an unsigned CIA memoto the chief of the agency’s Eastern Europe division acknowledged that a numberof individuals employed by Gehlen “appear from a qualitative standpointparticularly heinous.” By way of illustration, the author of the memo attachedbiographical summaries on several of Gehlen’s most repellent recruits, includingKonrad Fiebig, who was later charged with murdering eleven thousand Jews inBelarus during the war. Nonetheless, the memo concluded, “We feel it is a bitlate in the game to do anything more than remind UTILITY that he might be smartpolitically to drop such types.”But the CIA’s intimate relationship with Gehlen came with a price in the globalarena. Soviet propagandists made much of the arrangement, and even Britishintelligence allies vented their outrage. In an August 1955 memo to Dulles, thechief of the CIA’s Eastern European division reported on a diplomatic luncheonin Bonn, during which British officials freely aired their disgust to theirAmerican friends. “They were quite blunt in expressing their feelings that theAmericans had sold their souls to the Germans because of their frantic andhysterical desire to thwart Soviet military strength,” the CIA official informedDulles.Allen Dulles was unruffled by the controversy that swirled around his Germancolleague. He airily dismissed concerns about Gehlen’s wartime record. “I don’tknow if he’s a rascal,” Dulles remarked. “There are few archbishops inespionage. . . . Besides, one needn’t ask him to one’s club.” But, in fact,Dulles and Helms did invite Gehlen to their clubs—including the Metropolitan andthe Chevy Chase Club—whenever the German spymaster visited Washington. Dulleshad no reservations about working with such men, so why shouldn’t he also drinkand dine with them? Dulles even brought along Clover on those occasions whenGehlen’s talkative wife, Herta, accompanied him to America.Dulles went to generous lengths to maintain a congenial relationship withGehlen, sending him gifts and warm greetings on Christmas and his birthday, andeven on the anniversaries of their professional alliance. One of Gehlen’sfavorite gifts from Dulles was a small wooden statuette of a cloak-and-daggerfigure that the German spymaster described as “sinister” looking, butnonetheless kept on his desk for the rest of his life. Gehlen, in turn, cabledhis own chummy messages to the U.S. intelligence chief, and once sent him a goldmedallion of St. George slaying the dragon—the Gehlen Organization’s emblem—“asa symbol of our work against bolshevism.”Dulles knew that Gehlen was a devoted family man. The German intelligence chiefclosely managed the affairs of his extended family, installing a number of themin positions with “the firm,” as his organization was known by its employees. Inlate 1954, when Dulles heard that Gehlen was seeking to get his oldest daughter,Katharina, into a good U.S. college, the CIA director immediately began makinginquiries on her behalf. Radcliffe, where his own daughter Joan had gone, madeit clear that it was not inclined to give the daughter of a former Nazicommander special treatment. But Katharina Gehlen did win admission to HunterCollege in New York City.She later followed family tradition and went to work for her father, acting as ajunior spy on occasion and carrying confidential packages across borders. Gehlenproudly confided to American colleagues that on one such mission, Katharina hadthe foresight to hide her diplomatic pouch “below a layer of soiled feminineniceties” in her suitcase when crossing the border. In those more decoroustimes, the inquisitive customs official promptly terminated his inspection assoon as he came to the young woman’s dirty underwear.In 1955, as the CIA prepared to transfer the Gehlen Organization to the WestGerman government, the agency generously continued to back Gehlen, giving himenough money to buy a lakeside estate near Pullach, where he enjoyed sailing hisboat on weekends. Critchfield claimed that Gehlen bought the manor with a modestinterest-free loan of 48,000 deutsche marks (about $12,000) from the CIA, whichGehlen himself insisted he repaid in full. But reports in the Soviet bloc presscharacterized the estate as a gift from Dulles that was worth as much as 250,000DM.Gehlen was deeply grateful to Dulles, whom he code-named “The Gentleman,” forhis unflagging support. “In all the years of my collaboration with the CIA, Ihad no personal disputes with Dulles,” Gehlen wrote in his memoir. “He pleasedme by his air of wisdom, born of years of experience; he was both fatherly andboisterous, and he became a close personal friend of mine.”Despite the deep affection he had for Dulles, Gehlen felt free to air hiscomplaints about U.S. government policy whenever he suspected that America’sCold War vigilance was softening. The Gehlen Organization saw the Cold War asthe final act of the Reich’s interrupted offensive against the Soviet Union. InAugust 1955, after Eisenhower’s tentative peace efforts at the Geneva summit, aCIA memo reported that “UTILITY was blunt in his criticism of the U.S. positionat Geneva. He expressed the opinion that in the realm of international politicsone should never tell a Russian that one will not shoot him, and should under nocircumstances be as convincing in this position as President Eisenhower was atGeneva.”Western leaders negotiated with Moscow at their own peril, Gehlen firmlybelieved. The Soviet Union enticed you with this and that, but underneath itsskirt, “one will see the cloven hoof of the devil,” he said.Gehlen kept up his martial drumbeat throughout his intelligence career. ThomasHughes, who served as director of foreign intelligence in the Kennedy StateDepartment, recalled an evening early in the Kennedy presidency when Dulles gaveGehlen a platform for his militarism. “Allen Dulles had a soft spot in his heartfor the ‘good Germans,’ expansively defined,” said Hughes. “One of my firstsocial events in the Kennedy administration’s intelligence community was adinner given by Allen Dulles one night at the Chevy Chase Club in honor ofGehlen, who was visiting from his Munich headquarters. Gehlen led thediscussion, advising us how to deal with ‘the Bear,’ his term for the Sovietmenace. J. Edgar Hoover, sitting next to me, kept murmuring, ‘The Bear, theBear. That’s it. The Bear.’”Gehlen liked to say that his cold-steel view of the Soviet adversary came fromhis hard-won experience on the eastern front. But it was also calculated toplease American hard-liners, particularly his masters, the Dulles brothers. Somecritics in Western security circles attacked the ideological bias of the GehlenOrganization’s intelligence reports, which exaggerated the Soviet bloc’smilitary strength and nuclear capability. But the “cooked” intelligence servedthe Dulleses by giving them more ammunition for their militant Cold War stance.The covert Cold War in the West was, to an unsettling extent, a joint operationbetween the Dulles regime and that of Reinhard Gehlen. The German spy chief’spathological fear and hatred of Russia, which had its roots in Hitler’s ThirdReich, meshed smoothly with the Dulles brothers’ anti-Soviet absolutism. Infact, the Dulles policy of massive nuclear retaliation bore a disturbingresemblance to the Nazis’ exterminationist philosophy—a link that would bedarkly satirized in Stanley Kubrick’s 1964 film Dr. Strangelove, with itsFührer-saluting doomsday scientist. No other cultural artifact of the periodcaptures so perfectly the absurd morbidity of the Cold War, and its Wagnerianlust for oblivion. We live “in an age in which war is a paramount activity ofman,” Gehlen announced in his memoir, “with the total annihilation of the enemyas its primary aim.” There could be no more succinct a statement of the fascistethos.In the months leading up to the CIA’s transfer of the Gehlen Organization to thegovernment of West Germany, there was another flurry of debate about Gehlen inWashington and Bonn, which grew so heated that it spilled into the press. At thesame time, the Federal Republic of Germany, under the rigid leadership of theelderly, conservative Catholic Konrad Adenauer, was also involved in delicatenegotiations with the United States over West Germany’s proposed entry intoNATO. In October 1954, during a visit by Adenauer to Washington, General ArthurTrudeau, chief of U.S. Army intelligence, met privately with the chancellor todiscuss the Gehlen problem, telling the German leader that he did not trust“that spooky Nazi outfit at Pullach.” Trudeau advised Adenauer to clean housebefore Germany was admitted into NATO.All hell broke loose in Washington when Dulles learned that Trudeau hadtrespassed on his turf. Although the Joint Chiefs of Staff continued to backtheir man, it soon became clear (if it wasn’t already) who was running theintelligence show under Eisenhower. Trudeau found himself transferred out ofmilitary intelligence to a remote post in the Far East, and a few years later hequietly retired from his country’s service.During this turbulent, transitional period in West German affairs, ReinhardGehlen was confronted with a strong domestic challenger for his espionagethrone. In fact, Otto John—the head of BfV, West Germany’s internal securityorganization (the equivalent of the FBI)—was the only serious rival Gehlen wouldface during his long reign at Pullach. British intelligence saw Otto John as afar superior alternative to Gehlen. As a survivor of the ill-fated Valkyrie plotagainst Hitler, John lacked Gehlen’s unsavory baggage. After the coup failed,John narrowly escaped with his life to London, where he worked with British MI6for the remainder of the war, returning to Germany after Hitler’s defeat toassist with the prosecution of Nazi war criminals.A self-described liberal, John worried about the “re-Nazification” of Germany,as he witnessed the growing power of Gehlen and the many other former ThirdReich officials who were finding key positions in Bonn. High among theseofficials was Chancellor Adenauer’s right-hand man, Hans Globke, who had helpeddraft the notorious Nuremberg Laws, the racial identification system that servedas the basis for the extermination of German Jews.A CIA comparative analysis of Gehlen and Otto John unsurprisingly found that“John is the more moral of the two.” But, the report continued, John was “nomatch for UTILITY in the knock-about of German intelligence politics”—as wassoon to be revealed.In May 1954, John flew to the United States to meet with Eisenhower officialsand discuss his democratic vision for postwar Germany. Dulles invited him tolunch at his Georgetown house, and afterward they walked and chatted in hisgarden. Dulles was eager to hear John’s thoughts on the rearmament of WestGermany, a hotly debated issue at the time that Cold Warriors like Dullesstrongly supported. John assured the CIA director that he, too, favoredrearmament, but only if it was done in a grassroots, democratic way by forminglocal defense units, instead of “from the top downwards,” which would furtherempower the militaristic types from Germany’s past. Dulles was not pleased withwhat he heard. “My whole impression of John,” he wrote in a memo later thatyear, “was that he was not a very serious character.”Dulles was predisposed against John to begin with. Gehlen had filled the CIAdirector’s ears with venomous reports about his German intelligence rival,calling him “unsteady and rootless,” professionally inexperienced, and evenprone to alcoholism. What Gehlen clearly found most disturbing about John,however, was his heroic past as an anti-Nazi resister. His moral stature,particularly among the British allies, made him a powerful threat to Gehlen.John’s meeting with Dulles probably sealed his fate. After he returned home, theBfV chief became the target of a covert campaign engineered by Gehlen topolitically undermine him. Soon, Otto John’s life would take a sensational turn.In July, while on a trip to West Berlin to commemorate the tenth anniversary ofthe failed putsch against Hitler, John disappeared. The news that West Germany’ssecurity chief had vanished sent shock waves around the world. But the storygrew even stranger when John later surfaced in East Germany, denouncingAdenauer’s rearmament policy and his administration’s weakness for ex-Nazis.Gehlen gloated over his political enemy’s exit from the Bonn stage. “Once atraitor, always a traitor,” remarked the man who still considered opposition toHitler as treason.Then came the final twist in the bizarre spy drama. In December 1955, as theBundestag (West Germany’s parliament) launched an inquiry into the John affair,he suddenly reappeared in West Germany, claiming that he had been drugged andbundled off to East Berlin against his will. West German authorities did not buyJohn’s story, and he was arrested and convicted of working on behalf of EastGermany’s Communist government, serving four years in prison. But for the restof his life, John insisted that he was the victim of political treachery, and hestrongly implied that it was Reinhard Gehlen, the man who benefited the mostfrom his downfall, who was responsible.The elimination of Otto John paved the way for Gehlen to consolidate his power.In February 1956, the West German government formally moved to create a foreignintelligence service, the BND (Bundesnachrichtendienst), and soon after, withDulles’s strong endorsement, Gehlen was officially named its first chief.Gehlen’s triumph was complete: through ruthless determination he had transformedhis Nazi intelligence apparatus into the Gehlen Organization and finally intothe BND, giving him an official power base and legitimacy that made him the envyof his fellow Wehrmacht warriors.In March 1956, Reinhard Gehlen’s staff prepared to lower the Stars and Stripes,which had flown over the Pullach compound ever since Hitler’s defeat, andreplace it with the black-red-gold tricolors of the Federal Republic of Germany.But as Jim Critchfield and his wife packed their family belongings inpreparation for his transfer to the Middle East, there was one more urgent pieceof business for the departing CIA station chief to handle. On March 13, afterreturning from a week of secret government meetings in Bonn, Gehlen requestedthat Critchfield come alone to his office to discuss “a matter of someimportance and considerable sensitivity.” The German spymaster was sufferingfrom a cold and he seemed worn down, but he was too anxious to speak withCritchfield to delay their meeting.Gehlen quickly dispensed with the usual pleasantries and proceeded to present anurgent report on the state of European security. France and Italy, he said,seemed to be moving toward “the reestablishment of [left-center] Popular Frontgovernments.” Likewise, political trends in West Germany could lead to the fallof Adenauer’s conservative government and its replacement by a coalitionincluding the Social Democratic Party and “anti-Adenauer elements of the Right.”Though not Communistic itself, such a government would inevitably take a softer,“neutralist” line toward the Soviet Union, Gehlen predicted, and he himself“would not survive” in this pro-détente atmosphere. If a government like thistook over in Bonn, Gehlen warned, it would be “vulnerable to politicalpenetration and eventual control by the East.”After painting this ominous portrait, Gehlen got to the heart of the matter. Hewas prepared to take drastic action to prevent such a political scenario fromunfolding in Bonn—going as far as to overthrow democracy in West Germany ifnecessary. Critchfield immediately reported on his startling conversation withGehlen in a cable sent directly to Dulles in Washington. In the event of aleftward shift in Bonn, Critchfield informed the CIA director, “UTILITY wouldfeel morally justified in taking all possible action, including theestablishment of an illegal apparatus in the Federal Republic, to opposeelements in Germany supporting a pro-Soviet policy.” Gehlen, Critchfield added,would like to “discuss a plan for such an eventuality” with his friend Dulles,“in great privacy.”It is unlikely that Dulles was shocked by Gehlen’s proposal to reinstitutefascism in Germany, since CIA officials had long been discussing suchauthoritarian contingency plans with the Gehlen Organization and otherright-wing elements in Germany. In 1952, West German police discovered that theCIA was supporting a two-thousand-member fascist youth group led by ex-Naziofficers who had their own alarming plans for terminating democracy. Policeinvestigators revealed that the CIA-backed group had compiled a blacklist ofpeople to be “liquidated” as “unreliable” in case of a conflict with the SovietUnion. Included on the list were not just West German Communists but leaders ofthe Social Democratic Party serving in the Bundestag, as well as otherleft-leaning government officials. There were cries of outrage in the Germanparliament over the revelations, but the State Department worked strenuouslybehind the scenes to suppress the story, and similar alarming measures continuedto be quietly contemplated throughout the Cold War.These authoritarian plans were part of a sweeping covert strategy developed inthe earliest days of the Cold War by U.S. intelligence officials, includingDulles, to counter a possible Soviet invasion of Western Europe by creating a“stay-behind network” of armed resisters to fight the Red Army. Code-namedOperation Gladio, these secret CIA-funded networks attracted fascist andcriminal elements, some of which later played subversive roles in West Germany,France, and Italy, disrupting democratic rule in those countries by stagingterrorist acts and plotting coups and assassinations.In the end, Gehlen didn’t feel the need to overthrow democracy in Bonn, but hisorganization did undertake a variety of secret activities over the years thatseriously undermined democratic institutions in Germany. Backed by U.S.intelligence, Hitler’s former spymaster implemented wide-ranging surveillance ofWest German officials and citizens, including opening private mail and tappingphones. Gehlen defended the snooping as an internal security measure aimed atferreting out Soviet and East German spies, but his net grew wider and wideruntil it was cast across an increasingly broad spectrum of the population,including opposition party leaders, labor union officials, journalists, andschoolteachers. Gehlen even used his spy apparatus to investigate survivors ofthe Valkyrie plot against Hitler, including Dulles’s wartime comrade HansGisevius, all of whom he suspected of being Soviet agents.One of Gehlen’s more ethical deputies complained, “Gehlen is becoming amegalomaniac. He actually wants to play Gestapo for the Americans.” Gehlen wasacting not just on behalf of his U.S. patrons, but his clients in Bonn. Evensome CIA officials worried that Gehlen was being improperly used by Hans Globketo gather information on political opponents and fortify the Adenaueradministration’s power. Gehlen, warned a CIA dispatch from Bonn, “has lethimself be used most indiscriminately by Globke to further the latter’s questfor power.” On one occasion in the 1950s, the savvy Globke paid a visit toGehlen’s Pullach headquarters, poring over the dossiers of various Germanpolitical figures—and taking the opportunity to remove his own file.Ironically, while justifying his political snooping as a necessarycountermeasure against enemy infiltration, Gehlen’s own organization becamenotorious for its penetrability. The Heinz Felfe affair was the most notoriousSoviet mole case during Gehlen’s career—and, indeed, one of the biggest scandalsin Cold War espionage history. Felfe, a former Nazi bully boy who had ledrampaging gangs on Kristallnacht in 1938, was recruited into the GehlenOrganization in 1951. Not long after, the adaptable Felfe became a Soviet doubleagent. Fed a steady stream of inside tips by his Russian handlers, Felfe beganto impress Gehlen as a master spy, and he rose quickly through the Pullachranks. Finally, the bedazzled Gehlen named Heinz Felfe head of all anti-Sovietcounterintelligence operations, a position that put the double agent in ongoingcontact with the CIA and other Western spy agencies. Felfe’s reign as atop-level Soviet mole in the Gehlen Organization stretched for over a decade. Bythe time he was finally caught, he had wreaked inestimable damage on the WestGerman apparatus, resulting in the arrest of dozens of senior Gehlen agentsbehind the Iron Curtain, as well as the breaking of numerous codes and secretchannels of communication. A significant swath of German and Americanintelligence fieldwork had to be uprooted and started all over again.After the Felfe scandal exploded in the press in 1963, Gehlen tried to minimizethe importance of the deep breach. But though he would hold on to power by theskin of his teeth for the next several years, the spymaster never fullyrecovered from the political fallout. Adenauer never forgave Gehlen. For the“runt” Gehlen, who craved the approval of Germany’s father figure, thefalling-out with the chancellor was a grievous blow. The spymaster was alreadyin Adenauer’s doghouse for another scandal that had broken the previous year,when Gehlen was accused of leaking classified information about West Germany’snuclear armament plans to the magazine Der Spiegel. The leak—which wascalculated to damage Adenauer’s defense minister, yet another rival ofGehlen—made the chancellor so furious that he had considered ordering Gehlen’sarrest, finally deciding against it out of fear that it would only add to hisadministration’s political embarrassment.But Adenauer was still in a foul mood about Gehlen in June 1963, when AllenDulles dropped by the chancellor’s office in Bonn for a visit. By then, Dulleshimself had been forced out of office by President Kennedy. But the former CIAdirector still traveled the world like he was running the show, and whatevercapital he stopped in, Dulles found open doors. That day in Bonn, Adenauer askedDulles point-blank what he thought of Gehlen. According to a CIA memo, Dulles“replied, as usual, that he had known [Gehlen] long and well and regarded him asa stout and honest fellow.”Adenauer was not satisfied by the answer. The aging leader, who felt Dulles hadimposed Gehlen upon him, was in no mood to be manipulated again by the Americanspymaster. The chancellor responded “surprisingly,” the agency memo continued,“by asking [Dulles] if anybody involved in his business could be really honest.[Dulles] asked if [Adenauer] did not regard him as an honest fellow.” Thechancellor offered an elusive reply.The following month, Adenauer was still fuming about Gehlen. One afternoon inJuly, he ordered the U.S. ambassador to be dragged out of a Bonn luncheon sothat the chancellor could give him an earful about Gehlen. In his opinion, saidAdenauer, Gehlen “is and always was stupid,” which the Felfe fiasco hadunderlined in red. There was only one reason, said the chancellor, that he hadput up with the spymaster all these years: because of Dulles’s “personalinterest” in Gehlen.After Dulles left the CIA, the relationship between the agency and Gehlen wasnever as congenial. The German stopped visiting America, and the old tensionsbegan to resurface. By 1966, Gehlen was even airing his suspicions that the CIAhad put his family residence under surveillance. He expressed these fears,according to one CIA official, “apparently more in sorrow than anger.”But by the time he retired, all this unpleasantness had been forgotten and theagency threw itself into planning an elaborate farewell for its longtimecomrade. In September 1968, an illustrious crowd of CIA and U.S. militaryofficials gathered for a Washington banquet to honor Gehlen. In the monthsleading up to the farewell ceremony, the CIA mulled over the proper medal tobestow on the German—the agency’s Intelligence Medal of Merit, or the NationalSecurity Medal. Dulles was among those who attended the gala event. He latersent a warm note to his old colleague Dick Helms, who by then was running theCIA, thanking Helms for including him in the Gehlen dinner and expressing howmuch he had enjoyed “the opportunity to see so many old and mutual friends ofthe General.”Reinhard Gehlen lived out the rest of his years at his lakeside retreat,surrounded by his family—including his son, daughter-in-law, and grandchildren,who moved into one of two houses on the estate—and his German shepherds, whoprovided the only security he felt he needed. On windy days, he still enjoyedsoaring back and forth across the lake in his sailboat, another gift from theCIA.The occasional journalists who dropped by found him in good spirits, happy torelive his past and to share his thoughts about the state of world affairs.During his reign at Pullach, he had maintained an abstemious regimen, drinkingonly mineral water or soda at meals. But now he would indulge in a glass ofsherry with his visitors. Gehlen had no qualms when the conversation turned tothe war years; he seemed to enjoy talking about his exploits on the easternfront.The journalists who came by for sandwiches and sherry tended to be a generoussort. They asked the kinds of questions usually directed at retired statesmen orbusiness leaders.“When you look back on your life, how do you see it?” asked a reporter from aDanish newspaper, as she and Gehlen strolled in the garden that sloped down tothe lake.“I can only be grateful to fate,” he replied thoughtfully. “Everybody makesmistakes here in life. [But] I don’t at the present moment know what fundamentalmistakes I have made.” What made him “especially” happy, said Gehlen, was thathe had been able to give so much “human help” to the world."},{"pageContent":"12 [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-29]BRAIN WARFARE [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-29]On April 10, 1953, CIA director Allen Dulles delivered an alarming speech aboutRussia’s latest secret weapon—an insidious mind control program that Dulleslabeled “brain warfare.” Dulles chose an idyllic setting for his remarks,speaking to a Princeton alumni conference sprinkled with old friends, held inHot Springs, Virginia, a fashionable resort in a verdant bowl of the AlleghenyMountains where Thomas Jefferson once took the waters. “I wonder,” Dulles toldthe gathering, “whether we realize how sinister the battle for men’s minds hasbecome in Soviet hands. . . . The human mind is the most delicate of allinstruments. It is so finely adjusted, so susceptible to the impact of outsideinfluences that it is proving a malleable tool in the hands of sinister men. TheSoviets are now using brain-perversion techniques as one of their main weaponsin prosecuting the Cold War. Some of these techniques are so subtle and soabhorrent to our way of life that we have recoiled from facing up to them.”Dulles reported that the Soviets were engaging in sick science, seeking tocontrol human consciousness by “washing the brain clean of the thoughts andmental processes of the past” and creating automatons of the state who wouldspeak and act against their own will.Dulles’s speech, which he made sure received wide media distribution, marked anominous new phase in the Cold War, a militarization of science and psychologyaimed not simply at changing popular opinion but at reengineering the humanbrain. What Dulles did not tell his audience in Hot Springs was that severaldays earlier, he had authorized a CIA mind control program code-named MKULTRAthat would dwarf any similar efforts behind the Iron Curtain. In fact, at thesame time that he was condemning Soviet “brainwashing,” Dulles knew that U.S.military and intelligence agencies had been working for several years on theirown brain warfare programs. This secret experimentation would balloon under theCIA’s MKULTRA program. Launched by Dulles with a $300,000 budget, this“Manhattan Project of the Mind” would grow into a multimillion-dollar program,operating for a quarter of a century, and enlisting dozens of leadinguniversities and hospitals as well as hundreds of prominent researchers instudies that often violated ethical standards and treated their human subjectsas “expendables.”Dick Helms, who oversaw MKULTRA, advised Dulles that the scientific researchunderwritten by the program would have to be carried out in complete secrecy,explaining that most credible scientists would be very “reluctant to enter intosigned agreements of any sort which connect them with this activity, since sucha connection would jeopardize their professional reputations.” Many of theMKULTRA projects involved the use of experimental drugs, particularly LSD, whichHelms saw as a potential “A-bomb of the mind.” The goal was to bend a subject’smind to the agency’s will.Most undercover recruits in the spy trade were sketchy, undependable characterswho were motivated by greed, blackmail, revenge, lust, or other less thanhonorable impulses. But the CIA’s spymasters dreamed of taking their craft to anew technological level, one that flirted with the imaginative extremes ofscience fiction. They wanted to create human machines who would act on command,even against their own conscience. Dulles was particularly keen on finding outif LSD could be used to program zombielike saboteurs or assassins. He keptgrilling Sidney Gottlieb, the CIA’s top drug expert, asking him if thepsychedelic compound could be used to make “selected individuals commit acts ofsubstantial sabotage or acts of violence, including murder,” recalled thescientist.The Manchurian Candidate, the 1959 bestselling thriller by Richard Condon thatwas later adapted for the screen, dramatized this concept of a flesh-and-bloodrobot, a man so deeply programmed that he could be turned into a cold-bloodedassassin. It was a paranoid fantasy that had its roots in the Korean War, thatconfusing debacle in a remote Asian land that would continue to haunt theAmerican public until another Asian misadventure came along. During the war,three dozen captured American pilots confessed to dropping biological weaponscontaining anthrax, cholera, bubonic plague, and other toxins on North Korea andChina. The charges were hotly denied by the U.S. government, and when the airmenreturned home after the war, they retracted their charges—under the threat ofbeing tried for treason—alleging that they had been subjected to brainwashing bytheir Communist captors.The Korean War “brainwashing” story worked its way deeply into America’s dreamstate, through the aggressive promotional efforts of CIA-sponsored experts likeEdward Hunter, who claimed to have coined the term. Writing bestselling books onthe alleged Communist technique and testifying dramatically before Congress,Hunter “essentially modernized the idea of demonic possession,” in the words ofone observer. The self-described “propaganda specialist” described howall-American boys fell victim to an insidious combination of Asian mesmerism andSoviet torture science, which turned each captured pilot into a “living puppet—ahuman robot . . . with new beliefs and new thought processes inserted into acaptive body.”In the end, the Korean brainwashing story itself—the seedbed of so muchcreeping, Cold War fantasy—turned out to be largely fictitious. Dulles made muchof it in his Hot Springs speech, invoking in outraged tones the image of“American boys” being forced to betray their own country and “make openconfessions—fake from beginning to end” about how they had waged germ warfare onChina and North Korea. But a study later commissioned by Dulleshimself—conducted by two prominent Cornell Medical Center neurologists,including Harold Wolff, a friend of the CIA director—largely debunked thebrainwash panic. They rejected reports that the Communists were using esotericmind control techniques, insisting that there was no evidence of drugs orhypnosis or any involvement by psychiatrists and scientists in the Soviet orChinese interrogation procedures.Most of the abuse meted out to POWs and political prisoners in Communistcountries, Wolff and his colleague observed, amounted to nothing moresophisticated than isolation regimens and stress positions, like being forced tostand in the same spot for hours, and the occasional application of brute force.“There is no reason to dignify these methods by surrounding them with an aura ofscientific mystery, or to denote them by terms such as ‘menticide’ or ‘brainwashing’ which imply that they are scientifically organized techniques ofpredictable effectiveness,” concluded the Cornell scientists.In response to the brainwashing bugaboo that the CIA itself had conjured, theagency constructed its own intricate mind control machinery that was part Orwelland part Philip K. Dick. In Hot Springs, Dulles bemoaned the fact that, unlikethe ruthless Soviets, the United States had no easy access to “human guineapigs” for its brain experimentation. But, in fact, the CIA was alreadysubjecting helpless victims to its “brain perversion” techniques. Dulles beganby feeding Soviet prisoners and captured double agents into this mercilesspsychological apparatus; then drug addicts, mental patients, prison inmates, andother “expendables.” By the end, Allen Dulles would put his own family membersin the hands of the CIA’s mad scientists.In June 1952, Frank Olson—a balding, forty-one-year-old CIA biochemist with along face, mournful eyes, and a smile that revealed an upper deck of prominentincisors—flew to Frankfurt, where he was picked up at the airport and driventwelve miles north to Camp King, an extreme interrogation center of the sortthat would later be known as a “black site.” Olson helped oversee the SpecialOperations Division at Camp Detrick in Maryland, the biological weaponslaboratory jointly operated by the U.S. Army and the CIA. The top secret workconducted by the SO Division included research on LSD-induced mind control,assassination toxins, and biological warfare agents like those allegedly beingused in Korea.Olson’s division also was involved in research that was euphemistically labeled“information retrieval”—extreme methods of extracting intelligence fromuncooperative captives. For the past two years, Olson had been traveling tosecret centers in Europe where Soviet prisoners and other human guinea pigs weresubjected to these experimental interrogation methods. Dulles began spearheadingthis CIA research even before he became director of the agency, under a secretprogram that preceded MKULTRA code-named Operation Artichoke, after thespymaster’s favorite vegetable. CIA officials later purged their files ofevidence of the program, but in one of the few surviving documents, datedFebruary 12, 1951, Dulles wrote to his ever-accommodating deputy Frank Wisnerabout “the possibilities of augmenting the usual interrogation methods by theuse of drugs, hypnosis, shock, etc. . . . The enclosed folder, ‘InterrogationTechniques,’ was prepared in my Medical Division to provide you with a suitablebackground.”It was in secret overseas detention centers like Camp King where the CIA foundmany of the subjects for its Artichoke interrogations: defectors, double agents,and other unfortunates from the East who had fallen into U.S. hands. Some of thecaptives had been delivered to the CIA by the Gehlen Organization, which for atime operated out of Camp King until relocating to Pullach. During the war, CampKing had been a Nazi interrogation center for captured U.S. and British fliers.Afterward, the U.S. military turned the camp into a stockade for notorious NaziPOWs like the propagandist “Axis Sally” and the swashbuckling commando OttoSkorzeny. But by 1948, the camp was operating as an extreme interrogation centerfor Soviet prisoners, a program jointly administered by an unscrupulous allianceof CIA scientists and ex-Nazi doctors who had presided over medical experimentson concentration camp inmates during the war. At Camp King, CIA scientists andtheir German colleagues subjected victims to dangerous combinations ofdrugs—including Benzedrine, Pentothal-Natrium, LSD, and mescaline—under aresearch protocol that stipulated, “Disposal of the body is not a problem.” Morethan sixteen hundred of the Nazi scientists recruited for U.S. research projectslike this would be comfortably resettled with their families in America under aCIA program known as Operation Paperclip.One of the CIA-sponsored researchers who worked on the Artichoke interrogationsin Germany, a Harvard-trained physician named Henry Knowles Beecher, was broughtto Camp King by the agency to advise on the best way to induce amnesia in Sovietspies after they had been subjected to the agency’s interrogation methods.Beecher, the chief of anesthesiology at Massachusetts General Hospital inBoston, was an outspoken proponent of the Nuremberg Code, which forbade medicalexperimentation on humans without their informed consent. But he was one of manyprominent American doctors and scientists who lost their moral direction duringthe Cold War, enticed by the generous CIA patronage that featured virtuallyunlimited funding and unrestricted research parameters. Lured into a world wherenearly everything was permitted in the name of national security, Beecher evenbegan drawing on the work done by Nazi doctors at Dachau.After reading a captured Gestapo report in 1947 that indicated that mescalinecould be an effective interrogation tool, Beecher set off on a decadelong searchfor a magical “truth serum” that would compel prisoners to reveal all, a questthat later focused on LSD and would involve unwitting subjects in Germany aswell as at his own Boston hospital. Urging the government to expand its researchinto LSD as an “offensive weapon,” Beecher subjected his involuntary subjects tosevere overdoses of the hallucinogen, despite knowing that it caused “acutepanic,” “paranoid reactions,” and other trauma in his victims—a “psychosis inminiature,” he coolly observed in one government report, that “offersinteresting possibilities.”Ever since the Nuremberg trials, international legal authorities had moved toformally condemn the physical and psychological abuse of the powerless. In 1948,the United Nations General Assembly emphatically stated in its UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights, “No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.” The following year, the thirdGeneva Convention reiterated this fundamental commandment: “No physical ormental torture, nor any other form of coercion, may be inflicted on prisoners ofwar to secure from them information of any kind whatever. Prisoners of war whorefuse to answer may not be threatened, insulted, or exposed to unpleasant ordisadvantageous treatment of any kind.” But by defining the Cold War as aruthless struggle outside the norms of military conduct and human decency, thenational security regime shaped by men like Dulles was able to brazenly defyinternational law. Few of those involved in CIA brain warfare expressed anyethical concerns about their work. “I never gave a thought to legality ormorality,” one agency case officer readily acknowledged after he retired.“Frankly, I did what worked.”But Frank Olson did suffer profound moral anxieties about his work, and theresult was a serious crisis within the CIA itself. Dr. Olson began havingserious doubts after traveling to various CIA research centers in England,France, Norway, and West Germany, and observing the human experiments beingconducted at these black sites. Olson’s trip to Germany in summer 1952—duringwhich he visited Haus Waldhof, a notorious CIA safe house on a country estatenear Camp King—left him particularly shaken. Soviet prisoners were subjected toespecially severe interrogation methods at Haus Waldhof, which sometimesresulted in their deaths. The cruelty he witnessed reminded Olson of Naziconcentration camps. After returning home to the United States, Olson beganwrestling with his conscience, according to his wife and colleagues. “He had atough time after Germany . . . drugs, torture, brainwashing,” recalled NormanCournoyer, a Camp Detrick researcher with whom Olson had worked on projects thathad once made him proud, like designing protective clothing for the soldierslanding at Normandy on D-day.Olson and Cournoyer had also collaborated on projects that made them less proud.After the war, they had traveled around the United States, supervising thespraying of biological agents from aircraft and crop dusters. Some of the tests,which were conducted in cities like San Francisco as well as rural areas in theMidwest, involved harmless chemicals, but others featured more dangerous toxins.In Alaska—where the two men sought to stage their experiments in an environmentthat resembled wintertime Russia—“we used a spore which is very similar [to]anthrax,” Cournoyer recalled. “So to that extent we did something that was notkosher.” One of their research colleagues, a bacteriologist named Dr. HaroldBatchelor, learned aerial spray techniques from the infamous Dr. Kurt Blome,director of the Nazis’ biological warfare program. Years later, a congressionalinvestigation found these open-air experiments conducted by Camp Detrickscientists “appalling.”Olson began to worry about how his airborne spray research was being utilized bythe military. His wife, Alice, said that, in addition to being deeply disturbedby the interrogation procedures he witnessed in Germany, her husband was alsohaunted by the suspicion that the United States was practicing biologicalwarfare in Korea. By the time he returned from Germany, Olson was suffering a“moral crisis,” according to his family, and was seriously consideringabandoning his science career and becoming a dentist.Olson’s objections to the CIA’s brain warfare research apparently began to raisealarms within the Camp Detrick bureaucracy. One document in Olson’s personnelfile, dated after his return from Germany, indicated that his behavior wascausing “fear of a security violation.”In November 1953, before Frank Olson could change his life, he became one moreunwitting victim of the CIA’s mind control program. A week before Thanksgiving,Olson and several other SO Division scientists were invited to a weekend retreatat a secluded CIA facility near Deep Creek Lake, a lushly forested resort areain western Maryland. The scientists were greeted by Sidney Gottlieb, the chiefwizard of the CIA’s magic potion division, the Technical Services Staff.Gottlieb was one of the agency’s more unique characters, a stuttering,clubfooted biochemist whom friends described as a kind of untethered genius.Despite his infirmity, Gottlieb threw himself into such passionate, if unlikely,recreations as folk dancing and goat herding. The son of Orthodox HungarianJews, he rejected Judaism and spent his lifetime searching for his own form ofenlightenment, experimenting with Zen Buddhism and becoming an early celebrantin the cult of LSD. Gottlieb devoted himself enthusiastically to the CIA’smind-manipulation program, subjecting hundreds of unsuspecting Americans toexperimental drugs. The CIA chemist preyed on “people who could not fight back,”as one agency official put it, such as seven patients in a federal drug hospitalin Kentucky who were dosed with acid for seventy-seven straight days by aGottlieb-funded doctor who ran the hospital’s addiction treatment program.Gottlieb also excelled at cooking up rare toxins and clever delivery mechanismsin his laboratory to eliminate people the CIA deemed political enemies. Gottliebstrongly adhered to the Dulles ethic that there were no rules in war. “We werein a World War II mode,” said a CIA psychologist who was close to Gottlieb. “Thewar never really ended for us.”After dinner on the second night of the Deep Creek retreat, Gott-lieb’s deputyspiked a bottle of Cointreau and offered it to the unsuspecting Olson and hiscolleagues. It was the beginning of a nightmarish ordeal for Olson, which wouldend a week later when the scientist went crashing through the window of thetenth-floor hotel room in midtown Manhattan where he was being held by the CIAand plunged to his death. After being dosed at Deep Creek, Olson never seemed torecover; he remained anxious and confused throughout the week leading up to hisfatal fall. The CIA officials who took charge of him that week later claimedthey were planning to put him in psychiatric care. But instead they shuttled himaround from place to place, taking him to a New York City allergist on the CIApayroll named Dr. Harold Abramson, who had conducted LSD tolerance experimentsfor the agency, and even to a magician named John Mulholland, who taught CIAagents how magic techniques could improve their spycraft. As the days went by,Olson became increasingly agitated, telling Dr. Abramson—not without reason—thatthe CIA was trying to poison him.Shortly after Olson fell to his death from the Statler Hotel (now the HotelPennsylvania), someone placed a brief phone call from the scientist’s hotel roomto Dr. Abramson. “Well, he’s gone,” said the caller. “Well, that’s too bad,”Abramson responded, and then the caller hung up.Agents from the CIA’s Office of Security—the department made up of former FBIagents and cops that cleaned up the spy agency’s messes—quickly descended on thehotel, nudging aside New York police investigators. James McCord, later knownfor his role in the Watergate break-in, was one of the security agents who tookcharge of the Olson “investigation” for the CIA. The agency termed Olson’s deatha suicide, the tragic end of an emotionally unstable man, and the case wasburied for over two decades.In 1975, the case resurfaced during the Rockefeller Commission investigation ofCIA abuses ordered by President Gerald Ford. Olson’s widow and grown childrenwere invited to the White House by President Ford, who apologized to them onbehalf of the government. The Olson case would become enshrined in history asone of the more outrageous examples of CIA hubris and mad science. But as theyears went by, the Olson family became convinced that Frank Olson’s death wasmore than simply a tragic suicide; it was murder.“Frank Olson did not die as a consequence of a drug experiment gone awry,” thefamily declared in a statement released in 2002. He died, they said, because heknew too much, and he had become a security risk.In 1994, Frank’s eldest son, Eric, decided to have his father’s body exhumed anda second autopsy performed. The team of pathologists was led by James Starrs,professor of law and forensic science at George Washington University. The panel(with one dissenter) found evidence that Olson had suffered a blunt force traumato the head and a chest injury before his fall—evidence that was called “ranklyand starkly suggestive of homicide.” While acknowledging that his team had notfound “any smoking gun,” Starrs told the press, “I am exceedingly skeptical ofthe view that Dr. Olson went through the window on his own.”But Olson’s children failed in their efforts to reopen the case on the basis ofthe new evidence. In 2012, a federal judge dismissed the family’s lawsuitagainst the CIA, in which they asked for compensatory damages as well as accessto documents related to their father’s death. In ruling against the family,primarily on technical grounds, the judge nonetheless noted “that the publicrecord supports many of the allegations [against the CIA], farfetched as theymay sound.”Allen Dulles was coldly efficient when it came to ridding his agency of securityproblems. On the night of March 31, 1953, several months before Frank Olson methis end, Dulles invited an old friend and protégé named James Kronthal to hisGeorgetown house for dinner. The CIA director said he had business to discuss.But it turned out that the evening’s most pressing item of business wasKronthal’s own fate.The forty-two-year-old Kronthal was a rising star at the CIA, where his profilefit the mold for Dulles’s “very best men.” The son of a prominent New Yorkbanker, Kronthal was educated at Yale and Harvard, and served under Dulles inthe Bern OSS station during the war. Before the war, he had rejected the bankingcareer that his family had planned for him in favor of teaching art history atHarvard. But Kronthal brought a keen business instinct to the art trade,establishing himself in Germany during the 1930s as a broker for Goering,Himmler, and other Nazi leaders who were selling art treasures stolen fromJewish collectors. After the war, he sought to redeem himself by trying to trackdown the looted art pieces and return them to their rightful owners.The slightly built, brilliant young man became a favorite of Dulles, who helpedKronthal take over the Bern station in 1947, after it became one of the CIA’sfirst overseas outposts. When Dulles took charge of the agency in 1953, hebrought Kronthal back to the Washington headquarters, with big plans for theyounger man’s intelligence career.Kronthal wasn’t a charming extrovert like Dulles, but his superiors recognized arare intelligence behind his reticence. Helms was one of those who sharedDulles’s admiration for the up-and-coming agent, writing that Kronthal was a“top flight intelligence officer who commands respect from his subordinates morethrough demonstrated knowledge and IQ than through personal warmth andaffability. He is rather retiring as a person but this does not affect hisleadership or firmness of purpose.”Kronthal, whom Dulles fondly referred to as “Jimmy,” reminded the CIA directorof his only son, Allen Jr., another sensitive, highly intelligent young manwhose life once held so much promise. But in November 1952, young Dulles hadsuffered a serious head wound while fighting with the Marines in Korea, a braininjury from which he would never fully recover. For the rest of Dulles’s life,his son would rotate in and out of hospitals, sanitariums, and private nursingcare, growing increasingly remote from his father. And, on that night in March1953, Dulles would also lose Kronthal, a man the spymaster had considered amember of the family and even a possible successor.Kronthal’s proclivity for the espionage game derived, in part, from a lifetimeof hiding his own personal secrets. He was a gay man with a weakness for youngboys. The Gestapo discovered his sexual tastes while he was working in theGerman art market before the war. Later, while Kronthal was running the CIAstation in Bern, the NKVD, the Soviet secret police agency, got access toKronthal’s Gestapo files after penetrating the Gehlen Organization. The Sovietsset up a “honey trap” for Kronthal in Switzerland, with Chinese boys as bait. Hewas secretly filmed and blackmailed, and by the time he returned to Washingtonin May 1952, Jim Kronthal was a double agent in the iron grip of the NKVD.It was Colonel Sheffield Edwards, the former Army intelligence officer who ranthe CIA’s Office of Security, who informed Dulles that his protégé had beenturned. Edwards’s internal security department was tasked with protecting theCIA against enemy penetration. The security unit was also in charge of what wasdelicately called “enforcement,” providing the muscle to eliminate any potentialthreats or embarrassments to the agency.On the night of March 31, as Dulles confronted Kronthal with the Office ofSecurity’s revelations over dinner at his home, two agents from Edwards’sdepartment were quietly eavesdropping in an adjoining room. The sense ofbetrayal was certainly overwhelming for Dulles. But the CIA director, whose fitsof rage were legendary, held his fury in check that evening. The spy chiefsounded sadly contemplative as he spoke with the traitor in whom he had investedso much hope, remarking on the mystery of personal demons and how they could setflame to the most promising careers.After the two men reviewed Kronthal’s impossible position and his dismaloptions, the shattered agent walked back home—a white brick town house with asmall garden of spring daffodils in front, just two blocks from Dulles’sresidence. He was followed by the two CIA security men. When Kronthal’shousekeeper arrived the next morning, his bedroom door was still closed and hehad left a note that he was not to be disturbed. Later that morning, two men whoidentified themselves as colleagues of Kronthal appeared at his house and toldthe housekeeper they needed to bring him to an urgent meeting. When they openedhis bedroom door, they found a lifeless Kronthal splayed across his bed, fullyclothed, with an empty vial near his body.The investigation into Kronthal’s death was quickly taken over by LieutenantLawrence Hartnett of the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police, a homicidedetective with a history of helping tidy up CIA-related problems. Hartnettrevealed that Kronthal had left a letter for Dick Helms, in which he revealedthat he was “mentally upset because of pressure connected with work,” as well asa letter for Dulles. An autopsy concluded that Kronthal had taken his own life,but the report left more questions lingering than it answered, failing todetermine the cause of his death or the contents of the vial found in hisbedroom. Sometime before his death, Kronthal had mailed a letter to his sister,revealing his homosexuality (which came as no surprise to her) and referring tothe “tremendous difficulties” that his sexual identity posed for him. He thensigned off in a perplexing way. Kronthal’s final words to his sister were, “Ican’t wait till 1984. Love, Jim.” Was it his mordant way of saying that for him,Big Brother’s suffocating authoritarianism was already an unbearable reality?The James Kronthal case was, like the Frank Olson matter later that year,another mess that Dulles’s Office of Security had to clean up. If Kronthal’sdeath was a suicide, it appeared to be assisted. This is what one high-rankingCIA official, Robert Crowley, later suggested. One way or another, saidCrowley—who was interviewed after he retired by journalist JosephTrento—Kronthal was induced to do the right thing for the good of the agency andof the men who had been his professional benefactors. “Allen probably had aspecial potion prepared that he gave Kronthal should the pressure become toomuch,” Crowley speculated. “Dr. Sidney Gottlieb and the medical people producedall kinds of poisons that a normal postmortem could not detect.”Dulles never spoke in public about Kronthal after he was gone. Kron-thal’ssister’s efforts to extract more information from the CIA about his death provedfutile; the press made little effort to investigate the case. James Kronthal wasdropped down the dark well where CIA complications disappeared.Until he was wounded in Korea, Allen Macy Dulles Jr. was the brightest hope ofhis family. A brilliant student, he excelled at Exeter, sped through Princetonin three years, and then took himself off to Oxford, where he completed hisdegree in history, writing his thesis on the permanent undersecretary system ofthe British Foreign Office. “Sonny,” as his father called him, intellectuallyoutshone the elder Dulles, whose own academic performance had been indifferent.If Dulles took pride in his son’s educational achievements, he never showed it.At some point in their young lives, Dulles’s two daughters, Toddie and Joan,gave up any expectation that their father would shine his attention on them. Butthey kept hoping that Dulles would finally acknowledge their brother’sextraordinary mind. “Both my sister and I would have liked my father torecognize him and tell him that here was this next generation [of the family]producing special people,” Joan remarked late in her life.“I would imagine,” she said on another occasion, “that my brother, especially mybrother, would have felt badly about having no special attention from hisfather.”Allen Jr. was closer to his mother, sharing her sensitive and perceptivetemperament. He was acutely aware of Clover’s moods and the strains in hisparents’ marriage. To one family observer, it seemed as if Dulles felt judged byhis son.Sonny had thrived in the cloistered boys’ world of Exeter. But unlike hisfather, young Dulles recoiled from the hearty, fraternity-centered social lifeat Princeton. He was not elected to any of Princeton’s men’s clubs, and hedismissed the university’s intellectual atmosphere as insufficientlychallenging.One of Allen Jr.’s classmates at Exeter, a friend with whom he remained in toucheven after his life-altering war wound, was gay. There were rumors that Sonny,too, was similarly inclined.“Well, there could have been all kinds of experimentation at prep school,” Joanobserved. “I know nothing except [my brother] professed interest in girls andhad a girlfriend. . . . I never saw him with girls, but there was somebody heliked—I can’t think of her name right now. . . . Of course that was still an erawhen you didn’t come out in any way.”Even before his brain injury, Allen Jr. seemed to inhabit his own world. “He wasvery introverted,” said Joan. “He took after my mother in that respect. And hewas someone who wasn’t that aware of people. I mean . . . you’d go out in NewYork walking with him, and he’d be ten feet ahead.”In 1950, shortly after getting his degree at Oxford, Sonny stunned his family byannouncing he was joining the Marines, as war broke out in Korea. His uncleFoster used his connections to line up a comfortable stateside desk job for him,far from harm’s way. But the twenty-two-year-old enlistee volunteered insteadfor duty in Korea. It was as if he were still trying to win his father’sadmiration by outperforming the old man. The senior Dulles had fought both worldwars in bars and hotels, surrounded by suave foreign agents and accommodatingmistresses, and never firing a gun. Sonny would show him what real heroes weremade of.Sonny’s letters to his father from the Marine Corps were filled with a newassertiveness. He lectured the senior Dulles about the deficiencies of themilitary, filling page after page with detailed critiques of the wasteful andcorrupt supply system and the unfairness of the commendation process. He evenmade suggestions on how to improve the CIA’s recruiting methods. Dulles’sletters of reply, which he signed “Affectionately, Allen W. Dulles,” were notparticularly warm, but they showed respect for his son’s intricate line ofthinking.By summer 1952, Allen Jr. found himself on the front lines in Korea as a secondlieutenant with the First Marine Division. He displayed a gung ho attitude incombat that was sometimes reckless. On the night of November 14, the younglieutenant took charge of a rifle platoon that was dug into an advancedposition. Despite being nicked in the leg by a North Korean shell fragment, hecharged an enemy sniper’s nest by himself, braving intense fire. His gun wasshot out of his hand and he was wounded in the wrist, but that day he was lucky.“He didn’t have to do any of that, but I guess he felt he had something to liveup to,” said Robert Abboud, one of Sonny’s commanding officers, who had knownyoung Dulles ever since they were prep school debate opponents. “He never wantedto be treated differently from the rest of us.”The next morning, after he was patched up, Lieutenant Dulles returned to theembattled outpost. Once again defying heavy machine gun and mortar fire, Dullescrawled within thirty yards of the enemy position, armed with rifle grenades,and began to direct a Marine mortar attack on the North Koreans. Shortly beforethe enemy soldiers began to pull back, the lieutenant was hit in the head byfragments from an 81 mm mortar shell, which lodged in his brain. “I was therewhen they brought him back in,” recalled Abboud. “He kept trying to get off thestretcher and go back. Some of his men were crying. I’ve never really knownanyone quite like him.”Allen Jr. was evacuated to a U.S. naval hospital in Japan, where he underwentbrain surgery. Clover, who was on one of her Jungian sojourns in Switzerland atthe time, flew to her son’s bedside. His surgeons told her that they were notable to remove all the deeply embedded shrapnel from Sonny’s brain and that hewould never fully recover.By late February 1953, young Dulles was strong enough to be flown home. Hisfather, who was to be confirmed the following day as CIA director, greeted Sonnyat Andrews Air Force Base. Dulles was photographed hovering solicitously overhis son, as he was unloaded from the plane on a stretcher, with his head swathedin bandages. “How do you feel, son?” he asked. “You’re looking good.” Sonny’ssoft reply was inaudible.As the young man underwent further treatment at Bethesda Naval Hospital, heseemed to recover some of his old self. He recognized people, made jokes, andinquired about the latest world events. But other times, he stared off into thedistance, began shaking with fear, or erupted in angry outbursts at those aroundhim.When Sonny was discharged to his parents’ home in Georgetown, it soon becameclear that Clover would need help to care for him. A young marine was recruitedas a companion for Allen Jr., and the injured young man tried to resumesomething resembling a normal life. Dulles arranged an undemanding clerical jobfor his son in the State Department, and he even began taking road trips withfriends. But these experiments in independence did not turn out well. In August1953, Dulles wrote an apologetic letter to the American consul general inMontreal, explaining that his brain-damaged son had forgotten his carregistration when he left on a driving trip to Canada, and asking the diplomat’shelp in relaying the document to Sonny, which he needed to reenter the UnitedStates. The following year, Dulles had to intervene to sort out a car insuranceproblem when Sonny was involved in a collision, the details of which could notbe recalled by the young man. “My son was very severely wounded in the head andhas only partially regained his memory and certain other mental faculties,”Dulles explained in a letter to the United Services Automobile Association.Allen Jr. still showed flashes of his brilliance. He continued to readvoraciously, but he had trouble retaining information. Once familiar geographywas now a mystery to him. He felt most comfortable in New York City, and hisparents experimented with letting him stay there for brief periods. They renteda room for him in “a lovely, old brownstone that was lived in by an older lady,”recalled Joan. But the young man had lost what doctors called his “executivefunction.” He had a hard time organizing his thoughts and making his way throughlife. “He couldn’t really think, and he couldn’t really put two and twotogether,” Joan said. “And he began to get really depressed, and crazy.”Sonny’s debilitated mental condition placed an emotional and financial strain onthe family. For the next two decades, he would go back and forth betweenexpensive institutions and home care. Unlike his brother, Allen Dulles was not awealthy man. His salary as CIA director, $14,800 [about $130,000 today], washealthy enough for him to maintain the family’s comfortable home on Long Island,but he had long since burned through his partner’s equity from Sullivan andCromwell, and he could only afford to rent his second home in Washington becausethe owner, the relative of an old colleague, charged a token sum. The family’sfinances were soon stretched by the cost of private treatments and medicalconsultations for Sonny, which ate away at the family’s savings, includingClover’s modest inheritance.Though Dulles himself rarely showed it, Sonny’s gravely reduced abilities woredown the family’s spirit too. Allen Jr. had been headed for a distinguishedcareer in academia or public life, but now he had trouble finding his way homewhen he went out for lunch. Now and then, Sonny would stare at his father—and atUncle Foster and Aunt Eleanor, too—with a look of such rage that it made Dullesshudder. He sometimes launched into angry denunciations of his father as aHitler-lover and Nazi collaborator, outbursts that the family labeled“paranoid,” but were close enough to the truth to unnerve the senior Dulles. “Idon’t know what we’re going to do with him,” Dulles began saying to Clover.By 1954, Dulles turned in desperation to MKULTRA-sponsored doctors for help withSonny. It is unclear whether Dulles paid for his son to be treated by theseCIA-connected physicians, or whether their compensation came in the form of thegenerous agency research contracts that they received.Among the first CIA-funded medical experts the spymaster enlisted to treat hisson was the eminent Dr. Harold Wolff, chief of the neurology department at NewYork Hospital–Cornell Medical Center and former president of the AmericanNeurology Association, who became one of the agency’s leading experts on mindcontrol. Wolff was a sophisticated and cultured medical scientist with aninternational reputation for his research on migraine headaches, which hehimself sometimes suffered. His global roster of patients included both the shahof Iran and the shah’s political nemesis, Prime Minister Mossadegh.An intense and tightly wound man, Wolff set himself the goal of a new experimentevery day. Dr. Donald Dalessio, who interned with the renowned neurologist andlater worked with him as a research associate, remarked that Wolff’s “relentlessdrive for accomplishment epitomized the migraine personality that he so vividlydocumented in hundreds of patients.” He ordered his life around a “strictattention to the clock,” said Dalessio, “so that he was always on time, alwaysprepared.” Trained by the renowned Russian father of behavior science, IvanPavlov, Wolff spent long hours in his sixth-floor laboratory at New YorkHospital researching the mysteries of the brain. The lab was simple and “notcluttered with gear and impedimenta which characterize today’s [scientificfacilities],” observed Dalessio, “for it was made to study people, not animalsor molecules or other subunits, but functioning human beings.”The wiry, balding neurologist brought an obsessive drive even to hisrecreational life, swimming every day at his athletic club, mountain climbing,and challenging his younger colleagues to slashing squash games on the rooftopcourt of his hospital—“an eerie place,” recalled Dalessio, “where the wind wouldshriek about the stone battlements.” The son of an artist, Wolff also married anartist, and he and his wife listened to classical music every day and visited amuseum or art gallery every week.Wolff was a supremely confident man. After his death, another migrainespecialist commented that his career was marked by a “mixture of greatness andnarrowness.” The narrowness came from “a desire to be on top and to win, andfrom an intellectual point of view, his dogmatism” and overcertainty about hismedical theories. When Wolff was asked by a colleague why he had never botheredto be board-certified in neurology, he looked puzzled for a moment, and thenreplied, “But who would test me?” When Wolff was asked by the CIA to take aleading role in its MKULTRA program, he had no moral qualms. He himself wouldset the ethical boundaries of his mind control experimentation.Wolff was sufficiently aware of the professional, and perhaps legal, pitfalls ofthe MKULTRA research to make sure that the CIA would assume responsibility forthe most risky procedures. In a revealing passage in Wolff’s CIA grant proposal,he wrote that his Cornell research team would test “potentially useful secretdrugs (and various brain damaging procedures)” on behalf of the agency, “toascertain [their] fundamental effect upon human brain function and upon thesubject’s mood.” But Wolff carefully stipulated that any dangerous experimentswould have to be conducted at CIA facilities, not in his hospital. “Where any ofthe studies involve potential harm to the subject, we expect the Agency to makeavailable suitable subjects and a proper place for the performance of necessaryexperiments.”In 1955, Wolff agreed to become president of the Society for the Investigationof Human Ecology, the primary CIA front for channeling research funds to a widearray of mind control researchers in medicine, psychology, and sociology.Wolff’s prestige became a major asset for the CIA as the agency attempted tobend the science profession to its Cold War aims. The neurologist also benefitedgreatly from the relationship, garnering CIA grants of up to $300,000 for hisown research projects, and steering millions more to academic colleagues invarious disciplines.Wolff became a friend of Dulles and was an occasional dinner guest at hisGeorgetown home. His dominating personality made him one of the few men whocould hold his own in Dulles’s company. It was only natural for the CIA directorto ask the prominent neurologist if there was anything he could do for his son.Wolff, of course, readily agreed to treat Allen Jr.—it was the least he could dofor such an important benefactor. But, as a result, Sonny became another victimof his father’s MKULTRA program.Joan has disturbing memories of visiting her brother at New York Hospital, wherehe was subjected to excruciating insulin shock therapy, one of the experimentalprocedures employed on the CIA’s “human guinea pigs.” Used primarily for thetreatment of schizophrenia, insulin overdoses were meant to jolt patients out oftheir madness. The procedure resulted in coma, and sometimes violentconvulsions. The most severe risks included death and brain damage, though onestudy at the time claimed that this mental impairment was actually beneficialbecause it reduced patients’ “tension and hostility.”“They used insulin at New York Hospital,” recalled Joan. “I think thoseinitiatives—God knows if they were from my father. I don’t know, but I’ve alwayswondered about that, because it didn’t sound like a good idea.“When I went to visit my brother, it was hard for me, because he kept saying,‘Can’t you do something for me? I’m going mad.’ At the time, I didn’t know whathe was getting at, or what I could do. I was just visiting him.”It was not until years later, when Joan read exposés about MKULTRA, that sherealized how far her father had gone—even with his own son—in the name of brainresearch. “Once you go to the dark side, there seems to be no limit.”Sonny showed no signs of improvement after enduring the insulin treatments,although he did write his father a poignant letter from New York, indicating anew docility and a strong desire not to cause his family any more trouble. “DearFather,” he wrote, “I have just understood the nature of the psychologicalstructure that was built around me, and will work to free myself. I realize thatI have not been given correct information, but will try to learn the truthanyhow. Love to you and Mother and anyone else we know. I want to be united withyou all soon and will do anything convenient for you.”Despite Wolff’s lack of success, Dulles next reached out to Dr. Wilder Penfield,a prominent neurosurgeon at Montreal’s McGill University, whose psychiatricfacility, the Allan Memorial Institute, became a major center of CIA mindcontrol research. To Dulles’s great gratitude, Penfield agreed to consult onAllen Jr.’s case, which he continued to do until he retired in 1960.Like Wolff’s operation at New York Hospital–Cornell, Penfield’s academic-medicalcomplex also benefited from its relationship with the CIA. Penfield brought in aprominent, Scottish-born psychiatrist named Donald Ewen Cameron, who had knownDulles since the war, to run McGill’s new Allan Institute for psychiatry.Cameron, who had met Dulles while consulting on the Rudolf Hess insanity case atthe Nuremberg Trials, would become the most notorious scientist in the MKULTRAprogram. By 1957, Cameron was receiving a steady stream of CIA funding, throughDr. Wolff’s Society for Human Ecology, to conduct brainwashing experiments atMcGill that would later be widely condemned as barbaric.Despite his impeccable credentials, Cameron saw himself as an iconoclasticinnovator, pushing psychiatry to embrace the latest pharmaceutical technologyand the most cutting-edge developments in the newly influential behavioralsciences. Cameron’s experiments in the Allan Institute’s notorious “Sleep Room”involved putting subjects into “electric dream” states, as one victim put it,through insulin overdoses, massive infusions of hallucinogens like LSD and otherexperimental drugs, and alarming amounts of electroshock therapy—a process hecalled “de-patterning,” to wipe the brain clean of “bad behavior patterns.”After blasting away these negative thoughts, Cameron sought to replace them with“good ones,” through what he called “psychic driving”—playing taped messagesencouraging positive behavior to his nearly comatose victims for between sixteenand twenty hours a day, week after week, as they slipped in and out ofconsciousness. In one case, a patient underwent reprogramming in Cameron’s SleepRoom for 101 days.The people who came to Cameron were generally seeking relief from everydaypsychological ailments like depression and anxiety, even for help dealing withmarital problems. But as author Naomi Klein later wrote, Cameron’s “shock andawe warfare on the mind” brought only much deeper misery to the patients—many ofthem women—in his care. “Though he was a genius at destroying people, he couldnot remake them,” Klein observed. “A follow-up study conducted after Cameronleft the Allan Memorial Institute found that 75 percent of his former patientswere worse off after treatment than they were before they were admitted.”Cameron himself indicated that the true aim of his CIA-funded research was notto improve patients’ lives but to contribute to the Cold War effort byperfecting the science of mind control. He compared his patients to prisoners ofwar who were undergoing interrogation, saying that they, “like prisoners of theCommunists, tended to resist [treatment] and had to be broken down.”Gail Kastner, a promising young McGill nursing student, was one of the victimsof Cameron’s experimentation. She had come to Cameron for help with anxietyissues stemming from her relationship with her emotionally overbearing father. Atall man with pale blue eyes, Cameron exuded a paternal warmth, addressingfemale patients as “lassie” in his soft brogue. But in the end, Kastner wouldcome to think of the doctor as “Eminent Monster”—he was the distinguished man inthe white coat who loomed over her, as she was lit up with so much electricalvoltage that she broke teeth and fractured her spine while convulsing on thetable.Years later, Kastner told Klein what it felt like to be held in the Sleep Room.“I hear people screaming, moaning, groaning, people saying no, no, no. Iremember what it was like to wake up in that room, I was covered in sweat,nauseated, vomiting—and I had a very peculiar feeling in the head. Like I had ablob, not a head.”Patients’ minds were made blank slates; they lost much of their memory, andthus, much of their lives. “They tried to erase and remake me,” said Kastner.“But it didn’t work.”Val Orlikow, a young mother suffering from postpartum depression, was anotherpatient whose life was emptied out by Cameron. After she came home from theAllan Institute, Orlikow could not remember her husband, David, who was a memberof Canada’s parliament, or their children. Her mind had been reduced to that ofa toddler. She could not use a toilet.In the mid-1970s, after Cameron had died, the secrets of the Sleep Room andother inhumane MKULTRA research centers began to emerge, as journalists filedFreedom of Information requests and Congress opened investigations into the CIAhorror chambers. Eventually, the CIA paid out $750,000 in damages to ninefamilies whose lives were turned upside down by Cameron’s experiments—thelargest settlement against the agency at the time. The agency made it seem as ifits mind control experiments were isolated relics of the past. Testifying beforea Senate hearing in 1977, CIA psychologist John Gittinger called MKULTRA “afoolish mistake . . . a terrible mistake.”But the work of Cameron and other MKULTRA scientists lives on at the agency,incorporated into a 1963 CIA torture manual titled CounterintelligenceInterrogation that would be used to extract information from prisoners duringthe wars in Vietnam and Central America, and at black sites operated by theagency after 9/11. U.S. agencies and their overseas allies have continued to runtheir own versions of Cameron’s Sleep Room, where captives are subjected tosimilar types of sensory deprivation, electroshock, and drug overdoses, untiltheir psychological resistance has been broken.Allen Dulles was fully aware of the experiments being conducted at McGill whenhe sent his own son there. Joan doesn’t think her brother fell into the hands ofDr. Cameron while he was a patient there. Yet, whatever was done to Sonny inMontreal was not a pleasant experience for him.When Allen Jr. began treatment at McGill, Dr. Wilder Penfield insisted that theyoung man could improve. But Sonny knew his limitations by then, and the medicalregimen imposed on him only made him feel worse. “He thought my brother could dobetter,” recalled Joan. “But my brother was furious, because he realized hecouldn’t.”In the end, Penfield finally admitted that Sonny was beyond even the medicalwizardry of McGill. In February 1959, the year before he retired, theneurosurgeon wrote Dulles a letter, conceding defeat. “I wish I could help him,”Penfield told Dulles. “What a loss this mind de-railment is—to him, to hisparents and indeed to the world, for he had a splendid brain.”After Penfield pronounced Allen Jr.’s condition hopeless, Clover continued toagonize over his care. She often confided her troubles to Mary Bancroft, who bythen was living in New York. Caring for Allen Jr. was a never-ending job, Cloverwrote Bancroft in November 1961. She felt “joy” at having her son “accessible,”but when he was home with his parents in Georgetown, there was “such anunbelievable amount of planning, telephoning and hi-jinks of everythingconnected with [his] comings and goings—engaging Georgetown [University]students [to help] etc., etc. Will not burden you with a recital.”In another letter to Mary, Clover wrote, “Here everything is all right and allwrong, whichever way you wish to take it. Great Allen very tense and no wonderwith everything he carries, young Allen none too well, great Allen all too busyto attend to all the things I have to try to get [Sonny] to do and too pulled topieces by it all. You know it’s always everything too much or nothing enough andme so full of fear all the time and nothing to do about it.”From time to time, Sonny would explode in frightening rages. After weatheringone such outburst in February 1960, Clover wrote Joan, “It wasn’t exactlyterrifying but almost.” She assured her daughter that there was “nothingbroken,” but confessed there was a “terrific uncertainty [to] how everything isgoing to turn out. One of our Georgetown med. students was here and one ofFather’s aides and another came up from the office. I telephoned the hospitalbut first they said they couldn’t come over the District line and then they saidthe aide would have to have half an hour for dinner before starting!”Allen Jr. was “endlessly patient in general,” remembered Joan. But he violentlyrebelled when his family tried to return him to an institution. Sometimes “itwould take three people to hold him down when he would get really angry—notwanting to go back to the hospital.”Her sensitive, wounded son reminded Clover of her lost brother, Paul, who hadfound life too daunting a challenge. They had the same artistic temperaments,the same physical awkwardness. Paul had “the hands of a person who thinks anddoes not do,” she once wrote in her journal. “My son has them.” In 1959,Reverend John Sutherland Bonnell, a prominent New York Presbyterian minister whofor a time offered young Allen pastoral guidance, informed his parents thatSonny “believes that he has latent within himself the tendency that was ‘activein Paul Todd and which led him to kill himself.’” It was one more emotionalburden for Clover to bear, the fear that the family tragedy would repeat itself.Allen Jr. wasn’t the only family member Clover worried about. Her oldestdaughter, Toddie, started to suffer from manic depression in early adulthood, acondition she thought Toddie inherited from her, and began undergoing shocktreatments. It is unknown whether CIA doctors were involved in Toddie’selectroshock therapy. But Dulles was quite willing to steer suffering relativestoward MKULTRA-connected physicians.Lobotomies were among the more extreme mind control measures undertaken in theCIA program. At one point, Dulles arranged for his niece Edith—the daughter ofhis sister Margaret—to be lobotomized by a CIA brain surgeon. “She had cancerand was in great pain,” recalled Joan. “They tried lobotomy on her—all that camefrom my father, he was the one who suggested the doctor. It didn’t work at all,it didn’t stop the pain. It just made her odd.”Sometimes Clover thought that all the sadness and anxiety in her life was aboutto crush her. She felt that she was “walking on the bottom of the sea,” shewrote Mary in 1961. “It isn’t funny to feel all the time so impossible,” Clovertold her confidante on another occasion. “I envy the manic depressives havingtheir turn to be up.” Her husband’s secretive life—which, she suspected,continued to involve other women—and his emotional remoteness only made Cloverfeel more alone with her misery.At one low point in Clover’s life, a well-meaning CIA doctor recommended thatshe see Dr. Cameron. She knew Cameron from her husband’s CIA dinner parties, andfor some reason always felt uneasy in his presence. But out of desperation, sheagreed to have lunch with the McGill psychiatrist at the Mayflower Hotel duringhis next visit to Washington. Over lunch, she related her life’s many laments toCameron—including her husband’s affairs—while he stared intently at her. Aftershe finished, Cameron explained to her that her husband’s sexual transgressionswere a natural outgrowth of his complex and driven personality, and that shemust not take them personally. He suggested that she come to Montreal, where hecould treat her in his clinic and help her develop a more positive outlook onher life. Clover spent days agonizing over the decision, but in the end shedecided not to go. She did not know that by avoiding Cameron’s Sleep Room, shewas likely preserving her sanity.By 1962, a newly determined Clover had taken full control of her son’swell-being. On the advice of Jolande Jacobi, her longtime Jungian analyst, shearranged to have Allen Jr. admitted to the Bellevue Sanatorium, a venerable,family-run institution on the Swiss side of Lake Constance, whose directors hadstrong ties to the Jung Institute in nearby Zurich and to the great man himself.After all the frustrating and harrowing treatments that Allen Jr. had been putthrough for the past ten years, Clover was convinced that it was time to try asofter, Jungian approach, based on talk therapy, artistic expression, and dreamanalysis.Sonny’s mother and father accompanied him on the trip to Kreuzlingen, the quietlakeside village where the sanitarium was located. Before they left forSwitzerland, Dulles wrote to Dr. Heinrich Fierz, the facility’s medicaldirector, telling him that the family realized there was little hope for theyoung man. “It is a difficult case,” Dulles wrote, “and with the extent of thewound and the brain damage, we can only hope for limited results.” Dulles wasn’teven sure that he could get his son to take the flight to Switzerland. “At thelast minute, he might refuse to make the trip,” he told Fierz. By that point,Sonny’s faith in the psychiatry profession—and in his father’s judgment—wasextremely low.But Allen Jr. did move into Bellevue, and he found the facility so soothing anenvironment that he stayed there for over ten years. Like Hans Castorp’s “magicmountain” retreat in the novel by Thomas Mann, the Swiss sanitarium becameSonny’s refuge from a hostile world. Bellevue was built on a “beautiful, great,old estate,” recalled Joan, who often visited her brother there, and it hadtreated a wide range of patients over the years, including Freud’s famous casestudy, “Anna O” (Bertha Pappenheim). There was, Joan said, “a leisurely sort ofEuropean grace about your situation”—as long as you went on paying, she added.American institutions had a different attitude, she observed. “America is‘You’ve got to be doing something, buddy,’ whereas in Europe, you can just‘be.’”Young Dulles worked with Jacobi and some of her most promising protégés,including William Willeford, an American who had graduated from the JungInstitute. Willeford later recalled that he made a “connection” with Sonnydespite his severe brain impairment, taking time to write his parents each monthabout his daily routine and assure them that their son “had some kind of life.”The young analyst met with Sonny’s parents once in person at the Swiss clinic.He found Clover so insistent about communicating her views of young Allen thathe asked her to leave his office so he could hear her husband’s take on Sonny.But Allen Sr. had nothing of interest to say about his son, recalled Willeford.“He didn’t have any insights.” Later, Dulles passed word to Willeford that if hewas interested in joining the CIA, he should let him know. Apparently Dulles hadbeen impressed when the analyst had cut off Clover during their meeting in hisoffice. “He liked it when I said, ‘Let’s hear what the father has to say.’”The work that Willeford later published revealed a strong interest in thefather-son dynamic, that primal and fateful relationship that had weighed soheavily on Allen Jr.’s life. “Whether the son comes to experience his father asSaturn eating his children, depends on the kind of father the son has and thekind of male society he is being asked to join,” Willeford wrote in one book.“But it also depends very significantly on his mother’s sense of the value ofher own femininity, and on her way of mediating the values of the Father World.”After Sonny had been in Bellevue for some time, his father suggested that itmight be time for him to return to the United States, but he recoiled violentlyat the idea. “Never!” he shouted. “I’m never coming home to you, ever!”Bellevue was his mother’s world—a humane, Jungian oasis far from the cruelscience of New York Hospital and McGill University and the other institutionsassociated with his father’s world.Allen Jr. did not leave Bellevue until he heard that his father was dead. Joaneventually arranged to take him out of the sanitarium and move him to Santa Fe,where she had found her own sanctuary and was able to look out for her brother.Sonny never returned to an institution. Joan became his legal guardian. The twoelderly siblings still live in Santa Fe, in the same house now, both trying tomake sense of their past, in their own ways."},{"pageContent":"13 [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-31]DANGEROUS IDEAS [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-31]Shortly after 9:00 p.m. on March 12, 1956, Jesús de Galíndez, a lecturer inSpanish and government at Columbia University, finished leading a graduateseminar at Hamilton Hall and headed home. One of his students offered to drivehim to the Columbus Circle subway station so he could take a downtown train tohis Greenwich Village apartment. He was never seen again by friends orcolleagues.Galíndez was a charming, forty-year-old bachelor, popular with his students andattractive to women. Born to a prominent Basque family in Spain and educated asa lawyer, Galíndez was tall, slim, well dressed, and good-looking, with deep,dark eyes, and a receding hairline that added to his distinguished appearance.He emanated a warm, if somewhat melancholy, intelligence. He had the look of aman who had seen perhaps too much of the world but was determined not to beundone by it.During the Spanish Civil War, Galíndez had fought in a Basque brigade againstFranco’s forces. After Franco’s triumph, he fled for his life to France andbooked passage on a ship to the Dominican Republic, where strongman RafaelTrujillo had promised sanctuary to Spanish exiles. Arriving in late 1939 inSanto Domingo, the capital city, which the dictator had renamed Ciudad Trujilloafter himself, Galíndez found work as a professor of history and languages, andlater as a government adviser. But he and most of his fellow Spanish refugeessoon discovered that they had “left Franco’s frying pan and landed in Trujillo’sfire,” in the words of a Dominican diplomat.Rafael Trujillo had ruled the Dominican Republic since 1930, an operatic reignof terror that combined equally florid measures of violence and pageantry. Histheater of blood included the horrific 1937 mass slaughter of thousands ofHaitian immigrant workers, including women and children, many of whom werehacked to death with machetes. Trujillo’s political enemies were rounded up andtortured in the notorious concentration camp at Nigua and in the La Cuarentadungeon. Others were assassinated and their bodies displayed in macabrefestivals, like the murdered rebel leader Enrique Blanco, whose corpse was tiedto a chair and paraded throughout his home province, where his peasant followerswere forced to dance with his remains.Those who fell into disfavor with Trujillo’s regime lived in mortal fear ofbeing denounced in the notorious gossip column of the leading governmentnewspaper, El Caribe. Denunciations could ruin careers or destroy lives. It was“a method of [execution] that was slower and more perverse than when he had hisprey shot, beaten to death, or fed to the sharks,” as the novelist Mario VargasLlosa observed. “El Jefe,” as the dictator was known, was a master of fear.During the later years of his regime, in the 1950s, all it took to spread panicin the capital was for one of his security cars to crawl through a neighborhood.The black VW Beetles, known as cepillos, created the suffocating “sensation thatTrujillo was always watching,” in the words of one historian.Trujillo was also infamous for his official larceny, taking over all of hiscountry’s core industries, including oil, cement, meat, sugar, rice—and even theprostitution trade. Running the Dominican economy as a family business, heamassed a personal fortune that made him one of the wealthiest men in LatinAmerica. Trujillo’s sexual appetites were equally gluttonous, earning him thetitle of “The Goat” on the streets of the capital. He plowed his way throughthree wives, two mistresses, and countless young women whose physical charmsbriefly captivated him. Trujillo, whose mother was a Haitian mulatto, sought outplump white women—the beauty standard of the local aristocracy, which neverfully accepted the coarse former army sergeant. At his 1929 wedding to socialiteBienvenida Ricardo, Trujillo horrified the guests and confirmed Dominican highsociety’s worst suspicions when he used his military sword to cut the elegantwedding cake, sending the towering confection—adorned with frosty angels anddelicately sculpted sugar flowers—crashing to the floor.But Trujillo’s common ways won the admiration of many in the poor, uneducatedranks of Dominican society. He was especially popular among men, who admired hisnaked ambition, sexual aggression, and dandified fashion style. He embodied astrutting style of masculinity known by locals as tigueraje, an earlier versionof “gangsta” bravado that turned flashy bad boys, or “tigers,” from the barriosinto emblems of cool. Trujillo also provided thousands of young men from thelower orders—including mestizos, blacks, and other traditional social outcasts—apath upward, by expanding the Dominican civil service as well as the military,transforming his army into the second most powerful force in Latin America,after Venezuela’s.Trujillo further ensured his control of the presidential palace by assiduouslycourting the powerful giant to the north, pledging his nation’s allegiance tothe United States during World War II and the Cold War, and showering money onWashington politicians and lobbying firms. Trujillo’s courtship of Washingtonpaid off. By 1955, John Foster Dulles’s State Department was celebrating thestrongman as “one of the hemisphere’s foremost spokesmen against the Communistmovement.” That same year, Vice President Nixon visited the Dominican Republicand made a public display of embracing Trujillo. The United States shouldoverlook the notorious defects of the Dominican dictator, Nixon later advisedEisenhower’s cabinet, because, after all, “Spaniards had many talents, butgovernment was not among them.”Despite his enormous wealth, Trujillo himself was too thuggish a character towork his way into polite company, at home or abroad. But by the 1950s, hisroguish social circle had produced several personalities smooth enough to beembraced by the international jet set, including his first daughter, the sexybad girl, Flor de Oro, and the suave ladies’ man she was once married to andnever got over, playboy-diplomat Porfirio Rubirosa. The leading symbol ofDominican masculinity on the world stage, Rubirosa started his career as a lowlymilitary aide to Trujillo, parlaying his connections, good looks, and sartorialelegance into becoming one of the most celebrated Latin lovers of his day—“theDominican Don Juan,” the “Caribbean Casanova,” as the international pressanointed him.Rubirosa, affectionately known as “Rubi,” was the son Trujillo alwayswanted—much more polished than his own crude, debauched offspring, Ramfis(named, in Trujillo style, for a character in the Verdi opera Aida). Thedictator, like the rest of the Dominican male populace, reveled in the tales ofRubi’s romantic exploits. The dapper playboy had passionate affairs with blondmovie goddesses like Kim Novak and courted some of the world’s richest women,including American heiresses Doris Duke and Barbara Hutton, both of whom hemarried. Some in high circles sneered that Rubirosa was unworthy of theircompany, a lounge-room charmer with a permanent tan and an oily sheen. But womensang his praises. Hutton was particularly graphic about Rubi’s appeal, recallingher former husband with ripe fondness even after their divorce: “He is theultimate sorcerer, capable of transforming the most ordinary evening into anight of magic . . . priapic, indefatigable, grotesquely proportioned.”This was the Dominican image—lusty and glamorous—that Trujillo wanted to projectto the world, and particularly to the United States. Maintaining this positiveimage of robust vitality with his neighbors to the north was not simply a matterof ego gratification for the dictator. Trujillo reaped $25 million a year inforeign aid from Washington, much of which ended up in his personal overseasbank accounts, and he was eager to keep the American dollars flowing. The CIAfurther enriched the dictator with secret payments, delivering suitcases stuffedwith cash to his hotel suite whenever he visited New York for UN meetings.While Trujillo succeeded in crushing dissent at home, by 1956 there was oneman—Jesús de Galíndez—who, in the dictator’s mind, threatened his regime’s worldimage. Galíndez, who lived in a book-stuffed apartment on lower Fifth Avenue andenjoyed going to Latin dance clubs at night, did not strike his academiccolleagues at Columbia as an international man of danger. But to Trujillo, hewas a treacherous serpent who was poisoning opinion against his regime. Not longbefore he vanished, Galíndez had completed a damning, 750-page dissertation onthe dictator’s odious rule, “The Era of Trujillo,” and submitted it for a PhDdegree at Columbia. Scholarly theses do not normally incite violent passions.But Trujillo knew that Galíndez, who had worked in the Dominican civil service,had inside information about his savage and corrupt regime. El Jefe, who saw theGalíndez monograph as a stab in the back, brooded about the betrayal. Trujilloagents tried to convince Galíndez to sell the manuscript to them, offering asmuch as $25,000, but the scholar refused. The dictator decided that left himwith only one course of action.Galíndez saw his scholarly exposé of the Trujillo tyranny as part of a broadercampaign of popular liberation. In the mid-1950s, ironfisted regimes likeTrujillo’s dominated Latin America, with dictators ruling thirteen of theregion’s twenty nations. The Eisenhower administration found these despots to beuseful Cold War allies; they allowed U.S. corporations to exploit their nations’people and resources, and they cracked down on labor agitation and social unrestas Communist-inspired. But Galíndez’s scholarly activism—which included numerousmagazine articles and pamphlets he published in Mexico and the United States,attacking the Trujillo regime and championing human rights in Latin America—waspart of a new intellectual ferment that was challenging the old order.It was his experience as an exiled Basque freedom fighter, said Galíndez, thatmade him deeply sympathetic to the region’s social struggles. His own people’sdoomed crusade for self-determination made “the problems of Puerto Ricans in NewYork . . . or the drumbeat of a black Caribbean” reverberate inside him, hewrote.Galíndez’s life in New York, as a politically active refugee at the height ofthe Cold War, was a complex web. In addition to his activism against Trujillo,the scholar served as the U.S. representative of the Basque government-in-exile.Galíndez also maintained an ambiguous relationship with U.S. security officials.Galíndez’s escape to the United States in 1946 was no doubt made smoother by thefact that he had been secretly working as an informant for the FBI during thewar, passing along information about suspicious pro-Nazi activity in theCaribbean. After he arrived in New York, the bureau asked him to spy onCommunist-affiliated members of the anti-Franco resistance in the United States.In May 1951, the special agent in charge of the bureau’s New York office toldFBI chief Hoover that Galíndez was “an invaluable informant,” whose reports were“extremely detailed, accurate and thorough.”But FBI reports on Galíndez also noted that the Basque exile was stronglycritical of U.S. foreign policy in the Eisenhower-Dulles era. He had been hearddenouncing the administration for supporting the admission of Franco’s Spain tothe United Nations, and for backing Latin dictators like Trujillo andNicaragua’s Anastasio Somoza. In April 1955, Galíndez told an FBI informant inMiami that “since John Foster Dulles entered into the picture, the United Stateshas started to write the blackest pages of its international relations. Neverbefore in the history of the world has one single Government more effectivelysupported dictatorial powers in free nations.”Despite his scathing remarks about Eisenhower-Dulles policy, which made theirway into Galíndez’s FBI files, the bureau continued to have confidence in him,paying the university lecturer up to $125 a month plus expenses for hisinformation. The FBI also helped Galíndez gain permanent residence status in theUnited States. The activist-intellectual placed limits on what he would do forthe FBI—he refused, for instance, to publicly testify against suspectedCommunists in the anti-Franco movement, arguing that it would blow his cover. Hewas clearly playing a deeply intricate game of exile politics, perhaps believingthat his relationship with the FBI provided him and his embattled causes someprotection.But the bureau knew that Galíndez was not safe. On March 6, 1956—five daysbefore he disappeared—an FBI official noted in a memo that Galíndez’sdissertation on Trujillo “may involve informant in personal difficulties . . .this matter will be watched closely and the Bureau kept advised.”Galíndez was well aware of his perilous situation. Trujillo maintained a networkof agents in the United States, and they had already killed at least oneopponent of his regime in New York. Strange notes were slipped into his books oncampus and disturbing phone calls were made to his home. One day, twotough-looking Dominicans in bright tropical shirts sat in on a class he wasteaching.But it was not Trujillo thugs who were responsible for Galíndez’s disappearanceon that chilly March night after he taught his final class. His kidnapping was asophisticated operation run by Robert A. Maheu and Associates, a privatedetective firm staffed by former CIA and FBI employees that the intelligenceagency used as a “cut-out” to do dirty jobs on U.S. soil, where the CIA wasforbidden by law to operate.Grabbed by Maheu agents who were waiting for him in his apartment, Galíndez wasdrugged and carried into an ambulance, then driven to a small airport inAmityville, Long Island. There he was loaded into a twin-engine Beech airplanethat was specially equipped to fly long distances and flown south, stopping forrefueling after midnight in West Palm Beach, before continuing on to theDominican Republic. After landing in Trujillo’s kingdom, Galíndez—still halfconscious—was transported to Casa de Caoba, the dictator’s favorite hideaway.There, Trujillo, dressed in a riding outfit, confronted the traitor with theevidence of his betrayal—a copy of the dissertation, which his agents hadstolen. “Eat it,” he commanded. The dazed Galíndez took the pile of papers butcould not keep hold of them, letting them fall to the floor as his head slumpedto his chest. “Pendejo!” screamed the dictator in his high-pitched squeal as heflayed Galíndez’s head with a riding crop.Galíndez was taken to a torture chamber in the capital city, where he wasstripped, handcuffed, and hoisted on a pulley. Then he was slowly lowered into atub of boiling water. What remained of him was thrown to the sharks, a favoritedisposal method of the dictator.The abduction of the Columbia University academic from the streets of Manhattanis the first flagrant example of what would become known during the War onTerror, with bureaucratic banality, as “extraordinary rendition”—the secret CIApractice of kidnapping enemies of Washington and turning them over to themerciless security machinery in undisclosed foreign locations.During his final seminar, Galíndez mentioned several times that he was being“threatened by Trujillo people.” Maria Joy, one of his students, thought that hewas showing off. But later, after she read about his disappearance in thenewspapers, Joy felt “horrified”—not only because Galíndez had vanished butbecause something like this “could happen in the United States.”“If this can happen here, what is left?” she wrote in a letter printed in TheNew Republic. “There is no hope. . . . Everybody who has some sense ofresponsibility and a feeling for democracy and freedom should be concerned.”There was a flurry of public concern over Galíndez’s disappearance. On April 24,a group of Columbia University professors asked the Justice Department toinvestigate charges that Trujillo’s regime had assassinated their colleague. Thefollowing day, the case worked its way into President Eisenhower’s pressconference when a reporter for the Concord (New Hampshire) Monitor asked if theadministration planned to examine whether “the agents of a dictatorship whichenjoys diplomatic immunity are assassinating persons under the protection of theUnited States flag?” Eisenhower replied that he knew nothing about the Galíndezaffair but said he would look into it.But, in truth, the CIA had already moved swiftly to shut down the case. New YorkPolice Department officials, informed that the disappearance was a highlysensitive national security matter, put the case in the hands of the Bureau ofSpecial Services (BOSS), the NYPD’s intelligence section. The CIA, which had nojurisdiction to investigate domestic criminal cases, used secret police unitslike BOSS to take charge of delicate investigations within the borders of theUnited States. Dulles himself communicated the importance of the Galíndez caseto the NYPD, asking police officials to send a detective to the scholar’sGreenwich Village apartment to retrieve the contents of his briefcase. Policecommissioner Stephen Kennedy made sure the CIA director’s request was promptlycarried out, and the papers inside Galíndez’s briefcase were delivered toDulles. Kennedy made it clear to the detective that he was to keep his mouthshut about the errand.John Frank, the Maheu operative who organized Galíndez’s kidnapping, was closelyconnected to some of the principal BOSS inspectors working on the case. Frankwas a shrewd, ambitious operator who, like Maheu himself, had begun his careeras an FBI agent during World War II, before going to work for the CIA. Theforty-two-year-old Frank lived in Washington, where Maheu’s detective agency wasbased. But he kept an office in Trujillo’s salmon-colored, ItalianRenaissance–style palace, as the high-paying dictator became an increasinglyimportant client of the Maheu firm. Frank won the trust of the volatile El Jefe,who made him his bodyguard during state visits to Europe and the United States.The Maheu agency was also given a lucrative contract to upgrade Trujillo’ssecurity in the Dominican Republic.Although Frank liked to play tennis with friends in the spy set and boasted ofreading Voltaire in French, he was not part of the CIA’s Georgetown innercircle. Men like Frank and his boss, Maheu, were CIA contractors, entrusted withsome of the agency’s most risky and squalid tasks. They were not the sort of menwho played tennis on Allen Dulles’s backyard court. Maheu later claimed that theMission: Impossible TV series was based on his firm’s exploits—a secret teamwhose actions would be “disavowed” by the government should any of their agentsbe “caught or killed.” Men like Maheu and Frank were expendable.Bob Maheu fit the profile of an FBI gumshoe more than a CIA spook. A balding,rubbery-faced man, he had the bright-eyed, genial looks of a comedian who wasoverly eager to please his audience. But his eyes could go suddenly dead, andhis jaw could become grimly set. He came from humble origins—the son of devoutCatholic, French-Canadian immigrants who ran a small soda bottling company in aMaine mill town. Maheu worked his way up, graduating from Holy Cross and thenGeorgetown Law, and getting hired as a field agent by the FBI, where he workedon sensitive national security cases during the war. But Maheu was not contentto stay on J. Edgar Hoover’s civil service payroll.In 1954, he opened up his own security business, with the CIA—which put him on a$500 monthly retainer—as his leading client. The CIA used Maheu and Associatesas a front, putting undercover agents on Maheu’s staff. The agency also directeda stream of highly sensitive, and rewarding, contracts to Maheu, including amajor job for Greek shipping tycoon Stavros Niarchos that established thecompany as a leading player in the private security field. Maheu’s firm washired to help sabotage an agreement between Niarchos’s business rival AristotleOnassis and the Saudi royal family that the international oil cartel and theDulles brothers feared would corner the oil shipping business and harm Westerninterests. The oil caper involved a series of shady maneuvers aimed at smearingthe reputation of Onassis—and perhaps even more ruthless actions to eliminatesupporters of the Onassis deal in the Saudi royal court. After the successfulresolution of the case, a grateful Niarchos gave Maheu a bonus big enough forhim to buy a dark blue Cadillac and a split-level house in Sleepy Hollow,Virginia, to which he added a swimming pool. Maheu would become the top-paidsecurity contractor in the country, taking on confidential missions for VicePresident Nixon and eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes, who later hired him torun his Las Vegas empire.Despite his success, Maheu liked to say that he never forgot where he came from.Among the multitude of celebrity photos and gold-plated plaques hanging in hisoffice, he claimed to cherish most of all the wood sign that said “Elm CityBottling,” his family’s mom-and-pop business. “Call it my personal Rosebud,” hewrote in his memoir.Maheu did not socialize with the top CIA men like Helms, Angleton, and Wisner.He met Dulles only once. “It was an accident,” Maheu recalled years later. Therewas something about the Dulles brothers’ cozy power act that did not sit wellwith Maheu. “I always resented the fact that Allen Dulles’s brother wassecretary of state. You can’t have respect for the diplomatic pouch and be inintelligence at the same time. The State Department should not have to know howyou got the information.”It was his CIA handlers—Sheffield Edwards, who ran the agency’s security office,and Edwards’s deputy, the hulking Jim O’Connell—whom Maheu trusted and invitedto his home. These were the cops of the CIA—tough men, many of them ex-FBI andCatholic, who, like Maheu, were not afraid to get their hands dirty. The CIA hadan elite reputation, but within the organization there was a distinct classsystem: the Ivy League types on the top; the ex-FBI hard guys and former cops inthe middle ranks of enforcement; and the even more ruthless, and disposable,hired guns at the bottom.On Saturdays, Maheu would invite Edwards, O’Connell, and other Washingtonsecurity types like Scott McLeod—the zealous anti-Communist watchdog who hadbeen hired by Foster Dulles to clean house at the State Department during theMcCarthy red scare and then conveniently ditched—to watch Notre Dame footballgames and enjoy barbecue banquets and clambakes in his backyard. Maheu, whoprided himself on his cooking skills, carefully monitored the boiling potsfilled with lobsters that he had shipped from Maine. Buoyed by the free-flowingbooze at the clambakes, Maheu’s regular crowd would find themselves in cheerfulconversation with a curious range of special guests, from senators to gangsters.They were all part of Maheu’s colorful world, where the powerful mingled withthe infamous.Working with Shef Edwards’s team and their contacts in the NYPD’s BOSS unit,Maheu and Frank initially succeeded in containing the Galíndez story. ColumbiaUniversity president Grayson Kirk—a friend of Dulles and a trustee of severalfoundations that served as pipelines for CIA funding—did nothing to keep themissing lecturer’s case alive, prompting charges of university “indifference.”Meanwhile, the Trujillo regime spread the word that Galíndez was “suffering froma persecution complex” and had likely disappeared for personal reasons. PhonyGalíndez sightings were reported throughout Latin America and as far away as thePhilippines.At the same time, the CIA disseminated other disinformation about Galíndez toits friendly press assets, claiming that the missing scholar had absconded withmore than $1 million of CIA funds, which the agency allegedly had given him toset up an anti-Franco underground in Spain. Other CIA documents, whichcirculated as high as Dulles’s office, tried to brand Galíndez as “a wittingtool of the Communists.” The agency’s smear campaign succeeded in makingGalíndez’s character the story, rather than the shocking crime, and publicinterest in the case began to wane.But in December, just as the story seemed to be flickering out, Trujillo threwgas on the smoldering fire when, in predictable fashion, he went too far andordered the murder of the young American pilot who had flown Galíndez to theDominican Republic. Twenty-three-year-old Gerald Murphy had dreamed of being apilot his whole life, but, prevented by poor eyesight from joining the U.S. AirForce, he pursued a career as a mercenary pilot, winding up in the DominicanRepublic, flying missions for Trujillo. “It beats the hell out of Oregon,” thehandsome Portland native—who affected a James Dean look, complete withRay-Bans—told his friends about life in the tropics. But Murphy’s life took afateful turn when he was engaged by John Frank to fly the heavily sedatedGalíndez to Ciudad Trujillo.John Frank told Murphy that Galíndez was a wealthy invalid who wanted to visitDominican relatives one last time before he died. But after photos of Galíndezbegan appearing in the press, the pilot figured out the true identity of hispassenger. Given to reckless chatter when he was drinking, Murphy began boastingin Ciudad Trujillo watering holes about the big story that he was sitting on,and his chances of striking it rich by making a deal with the Dominican regimeto stay quiet. Trujillo, however, preferred a more certain method of ensuringthe pilot’s silence. Frank brought Murphy to the National Palace, telling him hehad been granted an audience with El Jefe himself. It was the last time thepilot was seen. On December 4, the young American’s Ford was found on a cliffnear a slaughterhouse, where the offal that was dumped into the sea attractedswarms of sharks. Known as the “swimming pool,” the lagoon was a favoritedisposal site for Trujillo’s enemies.Murphy’s suspicious disappearance ignited a new uproar, with his Oregoncongressman, Charles Porter, demanding that the Eisenhower administration get tothe bottom of this latest Trujillo-related mystery. In March 1957, evenStuyvesant Wainright, the wealthy Republican congressman from Long Island’s GoldCoast, waded into the growing controversy, writing directly to his neighborDulles and asking for more information about the Galíndez affair, which hecalled “an incredible invasion of a human being’s personal protection in ourcountry.” Wainright told Dulles that he felt a personal connection to the case,since Murphy had flown Galíndez to his fate from a Long Island airport. Dullesblandly replied that the CIA had no jurisdiction on American soil, so thecongressman’s inquiry about the case was better directed to the FBI.The Galíndez case, in fact, was turning into a major source of friction betweenthe two federal agencies. Hoover, who informed Attorney General Herbert BrownellJr. that Galíndez had been a valued informant for the FBI, took his probablemurder personally. Hoover was further enraged by the suspicious disappearance ofyoung Gerald Murphy and the new round of embarrassing political fallout from thecase. To make matters worse, the FBI soon tied John Frank to the crimes, a manwho was not only a former bureau agent, but, like his boss, Maheu, was now partof the shadowy CIA orbit that operated serenely above the law. As was commonwhen Hoover sought revenge in Washington’s political wars, he leaked much of theGalíndez story to the press. In late February, Life magazine ran a dramaticversion of the affair under the headline “The Story of a Dark InternationalConspiracy.”The Eisenhower Justice Department knew that despite the sensitive nationalsecurity ramifications, someone had to take the fall in the sensational case,and John Frank was the obvious choice. But, as federal prosecutors began tobuild a case for conspiracy, kidnapping, and homicide against Frank, the CIA’sgeneral counsel, Lawrence Houston, and Dulles himself huddled anxiously with theattorney general. Brownell assured the CIA that he would keep the case tightlyheld to avoid further press leaks because he realized that the affair involved“keen” national security interests. Brownell’s deputies grew frustrated as theytried to peel away the layers surrounding the case. In March 1957, AssistantDeputy Attorney General Warren Olney III complained in a memo to Brownell, “Inmy opinion the information given to you by CIA is vague and uncertain and doesnot resolve the question as to whether [Frank] has in fact been used in anycapacity by CIA.” Olney recommended that the CIA “be requested directly anddefinitely” to state its exact relationship with the man at the center of theGalíndez mystery.After intricate negotiations between the Justice Department and the CIA, JohnFrank was finally charged with an astonishingly light offense: failure toregister as a foreign agent. “I fully appreciate that to indict a personinvolved in a possible murder and kidnapping for violation of the RegistrationAct is like hitting a man with a feather when he should be hit with a rock,”acknowledged one chagrinned Justice Department official. But considering thehighly charged political atmosphere surrounding the case, he observed, it wasthe only way to ensure that “the subject will [not] escape scot-free.”In December 1957, Frank was convicted of multiple counts of violating theRegistration Act and sentenced to a maximum eight months to two years in federalprison. But the following year, his conviction was overturned by a federalappeals court in the District of Columbia that ruled that Frank had been denieda fair trial because of “the prosecutor’s attempt to connect him in the jury’smind with the Galíndez-Murphy affair.” As he entered the second round of hislegal battle, Frank made it clear that he was not going to be the fall guy forthe CIA on the Galíndez case. Before his new trial began, Frank played his trumpcard, making it known that his line of defense would be that he had been workingfor U.S. intelligence throughout the affair. When Frank’s lawyer issuedsubpoenas for several CIA witnesses to appear in court, agency officials quicklymoved to block them from testifying, thereby aborting the trial. The JusticeDepartment was forced to strike a plea bargain with Frank, and in March 1959, hepaid a modest fine, signed an agreement not to work as a foreign agent, andwalked out of court a free man. Nobody was ever charged in the murders of Jesusde Galíndez or Gerald Murphy.Allen Dulles’s CIA believed in the power of ideas. It was easy for Dulles’s IvyLeague–educated executive team to understand why the Trujillo regime became soobsessed with a doctoral dissertation written by an obscure academic. They knewthat ideas mattered: they floated like seeds on the wind, over mountains andseas, and took root in the most unexpected places. The Cold War was, in fact, awar of ideas, fought primarily in the realm of the symbolic, through propagandacampaigns and “proxy” conflicts, instead of on battlegrounds where thesuperpowers clashed head-to-head.Joseph Stalin, too, understood the power of words, calling writers “theengineers of the human soul.” The Soviet leader had a way of expressing himselfwith industrial bluntness. “The production of souls,” he stated, “is moreimportant than the production of tanks.” Stalin engineered a conformity ofSoviet thought by executing writers, intellectuals, and artists who did not toethe party line, or by exiling them to the gulag’s frozen extremities.The CIA’s methods of cultural engineering were far more subtle but no lesseffective. The agency spent an inestimable fortune on the war of ideas,subsidizing the intellectual and creative labors of those who were deemedpolitically correct and seeking to marginalize those who challenged the“crackpot realism” of Cold War orthodoxy. The main front organization used bythe CIA to spread its largesse and influence was the Congress for CulturalFreedom, “a kind of cultural NATO,” in one critic’s words, founded in 1950 tocounter the propaganda efforts of the Soviet bloc. The Congress for CulturalFreedom grew to become one of the biggest arts patrons in world history,sponsoring an impressive array of book publishing start-ups and literarymagazines—including the influential Encounter and Paris Review—as well as artexhibits, literary prizes, concert tours, and international conferences held inParis, Berlin, and the Rockefeller Foundation’s Bellagio retreat overlookingLake Como.There was a seductive appeal to the CIA’s cultural patronage, for it offered notonly the satisfaction of doing one’s patriotic duty and resisting Stalinisttyranny, but also a comfortable reprieve from the financial anxieties of thefreelance, creative life. “These stylish and expensive excursions must have beena great pleasure for the people who took them at government expense,” remarkedJason Epstein, former Random House editorial director and cofounder of The NewYork Review of Books. “But it was more than pleasure, because they were tastingpower. Who wouldn’t like to be in a situation where you’re politically correctand at the same time well compensated for the position you’ve taken?”Many leading artists and intellectuals fell into the ranks of the CIA’sgenerously funded culture war, including Arthur Schlesinger Jr., Mary McCarthy,Robert Lowell, Dwight Macdonald, Daniel Bell, Isaiah Berlin, George Plimpton,Peter Matthiessen, and Mark Rothko. But the recipients of CIA sponsorship paid aprice: their intellectual independence. As historian Frances Stonor Saundersobserved, “The individuals and institutions subsidized by the CIA were expectedto perform as part . . . of a propaganda war.” Those who took agency fundsbecame “cheerful robots” of the Cold War, in C. Wright Mills’s memorable phrase.Mills, one of the few prominent American scholars to actively resist the sirencalls of the Cold War intelligentsia, was predictably attacked in these circles.While Mills was coming under fire in the pages of CIA-funded publications likeEncounter, he was embraced by leftist intellectuals in Europe such as RalphMiliband (father of British Labour Party leader Ed Miliband) and historianEdward Thompson, who declared, “Wright is fortunate in his enemies.”Mills was fortunate in other ways, too. His intellectual gifts and personalfortitude allowed him to carve out a prominent public position for himself, evenat the height of Cold War conformity in America. But most of those whochallenged the era’s mandatory spirit of American triumphalism soon foundthemselves intellectually isolated and professionally invisible. Under the reignof CIA-approved thought, unpleasant realities about the U.S. imperium wereconsidered out-of-bounds for scholarly or journalistic exploration, includingthe bloody regime changes in Iran and Guatemala and the boiling cauldron ofracial injustice at home. The grants, literary prizes, journalism awards, andacademic endowments went to those who saw America as the hope of the world, notto those who focused on its deep flaws.Those CIA-approved intellectuals who dared to assert their independence soonfound that once-welcoming doors were closed to them. In 1958, Dwight Macdonald—afrequent intellectual sparring partner of his friend Mills—broke out of the ColdWar thought bubble with a cranky article for Encounter titled “America,America,” in which he railed against the idiocy of the country’s mass culture.There was nothing particularly surprising about Macdonald’s highbrow lamentabout the spread of primitivism in pop culture. But the article was deemedunacceptable by the editors of Encounter, and though Macdonald was a formereditor of Encounter, the magazine refused to publish it.Like many of the CIA-sponsored literary projects, Encounter reflected theaesthetics of James Jesus Angleton, the CIA’s unofficial cultural commissar. Asa Yale undergraduate, Angleton had founded the avant-garde literary magazineFurioso and befriended Ezra Pound and e.e. cummings. The spy wizard was adevotee of the modernist school of poetry—particularly its high priest, T. S.Eliot—and the pages of Encounter were dominated by an Eliotic sensibility,though Eliot himself shunned the London-based publication as so “obviouslypublished under American auspices.”A new generation of Beat poets led by Allen Ginsberg was beginning to challengethe reign of literary modernism, invoking the lush populism and unabasheddeviancy of Walt Whitman. As the Beats laid siege to Eisenhower-era culturalbanality, the CIA-funded poetry establishment struggled to keep these barbariansoutside the gates. Years later, Ginsberg imagined a confrontation betweenhimself and Angleton’s favorite poet on the fantail of a boat in Europeanwaters. “What did you think of the dominance of poetics by the CIA?” Ginsbergasks Eliot. “After all, wasn’t Angleton your friend?” The old master admits heknew of the infamous spook’s “literary conspiracies” but insists they were “ofno importance to Literature.” But Ginsberg passionately disagrees. The CIA, hetells Eliot, secretly funded a “whole field of Scholars of War” and “nourishedthe careers of too many square intellectuals,” thereby undermining efforts to“create an alternative free vital decentralized culture.” The result, asGinsberg wrote in his 1956 masterpiece, Howl, was the unchallenged rise of theAmerican Moloch, “vast stone of war . . . whose soul is electricity and banks,”and a culture that devoured the souls of its own children.Angleton carried an elaborate portfolio at the CIA, from the politics of art tothe metaphysics of assassination. In December 1954, Dulles officially named himchief of counterintelligence, the department tasked with blocking enemypenetration of the agency. But, in reality, his manifold duties were as hard toget a hold on as the smoke curling up from the chain of cigarettes he inhaledthroughout the day. “I remember Jim as one of the most complex men I have everknown,” recalled Dick Helms, one of Angleton’s vital defenders and patronswithin the agency. “One did not always have to agree with him to know that hepossessed a unique grasp of secret operations. As a friend remarked, Jim had theability to raise an operational discussion not only to a higher level but toanother dimension. It is easy to mock this, but there was no one within theagency with whom I would rather have discussed a complex operational problemthan Angleton.”Angleton’s activities ranged from purloining documents at foreign embassies toopening the mail of American citizens (he once jocularly referred to himself as“the postmaster”) to wiretapping the bedrooms of CIA officials. It was his jobto be suspicious of everybody, and he was, keeping a treasure trove of sensitivefiles and photos in the locked vault in his office. Each morning at CIAheadquarters, Angleton would report to Dulles on the results of his “fishingexpeditions,” as they called his electronic eavesdropping missions, which pickedup everything from gossip on the Georgetown party circuit to Washington pillowtalk.As Dulles was well aware, Angleton had even tucked away explosive secrets aboutthe CIA director himself. That is why Dulles had rewarded him with the mostsensitive job in the agency, Angleton confided to journalist Joseph Trento nearthe end of his life. “You know how I got to be in charge of counterintelligence?I agreed not to polygraph or require detailed background checks on Allen Dullesand 60 of his closest friends. They were afraid that their own business dealingswith Hitler’s pals would come out.”Angleton’s selection as the top hunter of Soviet moles struck many in the agencyas peculiar. During and after the war, Angleton had been badly fooled by hisclose chum in British intelligence, the legendary double agent Kim Philby. Thewitty, bibulous, stammering Philby, who had betrayed his class and country bysecretly going to work for Soviet intelligence as a young Cambridge graduate inthe 1930s, forged a tight friendship with Angleton in London during the war.Philby and the Anglophilic Angleton, who had attended the upper-crust Britishboarding school Malvern, renewed their relationship when Philby was posted toWashington, D.C., in 1949, as the British Secret Intelligence Service liaison.The two men shared long, sodden lunches at Harvey’s, a Washington powerrestaurant also favored by the likes of Hoover and his companion, Clyde Tolson.Angleton’s children remembered the drunken nursery games played by Philby andhis friends Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean, who belonged to the same secret ringof Cambridge-bred traitors, when they were invited to the Angleton home inArlington for dinner. “They’d start chasing each other through the house in thislittle choo-choo train,” according to Siri Hari Angleton, the spymaster’syoungest daughter, “these men in their Eton ties, screaming and laughing!” Atanother raucous party, she recalled, “Philby’s wife passed out, and was justlying on the floor. Mummy said, ‘Oh, Kim, don’t you want to see how Mrs. Philbyis doing?’ And he said, ‘Ahhh . . .’ and just stepped right over her to getanother drink.”Angleton struck people as a wispy figure of a man. He was known as the “GrayGhost” in agency circles—a tall, stooped, ashen-faced figure, with a bony,clothes-rack frame, draped in elegant, European-tailored suits, and wreathed inhis customary rings of smoke. But around Philby, Angleton seemed to come alive,to glow. They were boarding school boys again.After Philby was finally exposed, ultimately fleeing to Russia, Angleton’santi-Soviet sentiments hardened into a fundamentalism that clouded his judgment.“I have no doubt that the exposure of Kim Philby was lodged in the deepestrecesses of Jim’s being,” Helms later commented. If he were the sort of chap whomurdered people, Angleton told a friend in British intelligence, “I would killPhilby.” The betrayal was painfully intimate, and it bred a paranoia thatbloomed darkly within Angleton. When he was named counterintelligence chief, hesaw traitors and signs of Soviet treachery everywhere. His compulsive molehunting ruined the careers of dozens of CIA agents, doing more to damage agencysecurity than to fortify it. “I couldn’t find that we ever caught a spy underJim,” said William Colby, the CIA director who finally terminated Angleton’slong tenure in 1975.But under Dulles, Angleton enjoyed free rein to pursue his demons. He dreamed upCold War phantasms and bogeymen, and then invented all-too-real methods ofdestroying these horrible apparitions. He operated a kind of virtual CIA withinthe CIA, reporting only to Dulles himself—and even the top spymaster was notfully aware of his murky activities. “My father once said, ‘I’m not a genius,but in intelligence I am a genius,’” recalled Siri Hari Angleton, who changedher name from Lucy as a young woman, after following her mother and older sisterinto the Sikh religion.Dulles and Angleton went way back together, to the dark maze of postwar Rome.Like Helms, Dulles admired Angleton’s complex mind and the deep calculus of hisspycraft. “Jim,” Dulles once told Angleton’s wife, Cicely, “is the apple of myeye.” Angleton, in turn, grew deeply fond of Dulles, whom he looked up to as afather figure, and of Clover Dulles, too, with whom he shared a creativetemperament.“Angleton was fascinating,” recalled Joan (Dulles) Talley. “My mother liked hima lot, he was very talkative, very intellectual. He was an odd one, he fussedover the orchids he grew—which I think was a wonderful obsession of his—and hedrank too much. But he was lots of fun for anyone to talk to, you’d never knowwhere the conversation was going to go. He’d jump from orchid colors toflyfishing to poetry and music. He was a real scholar, and he was an oddball. Atotally unique creation.”Angleton expressed an appreciation for Clover’s art, and he once begged her fora self-portrait that she had painted. Clover suspected that the aesthetic spywas “in his cups” when he made the request, but she agreed to give it to him, asshe later told Joan, “because Jim labors day and night for CIA and Dad.” The twocouples enjoyed each other’s company, and the Angletons were often invited fordinner at Q Street. Cicely Angleton came from a prosperous family that had madea fortune in Minnesota iron ore—and, educated at Vassar, she shared Clover’sinterests in spirituality and the arts. Cicely later published several volumesof poetry, taking the creative path that her husband otherwise might have gonedown.Dulles and Angleton shared a disdain for Washington bureaucracy and for thegovernmental oversight that comes with a functioning democratic system. Later,in the post-Watergate ’70s, when the Church Committee opened its probe of CIAlawbreaking, Angleton was called to account for himself. As he completed histestimony, the Gray Ghost rose from his chair, and, thinking he was now off therecord, muttered, “It is inconceivable that a secret intelligence arm of thegovernment has to comply with all the overt orders of the government.” It was aconcise articulation of the Angleton philosophy; in his mind, CIA overseers werea priestly caste that, because the fate of the nation had been placed in itshands, must be allowed to operate unfettered and above the law.“Allen wasn’t red-tape and neither was daddy,” said Siri Hari. “You know, backthen, people were much more interesting. . . . I don’t think it was a case ofresenting bureaucracy, because the bureaucracy just never came that close tothem anyway, so why would they resent it? They probably just felt, you know, alittle beyond it, a little above it.”Dulles entrusted Angleton with the agency’s most vital and sensitive missions.He was the principal CIA liaison with the key foreign intelligence services,including those in frontline Cold War nations like France, West Germany, Turkey,Taiwan, and Yugoslavia, as well as with Mossad, the Israeli spy agency. Angletondeveloped a special bond with the Israelis, forging a realpolitik relationship,with both parties conveniently overlooking Angleton’s role in the Nazi ratlinesafter the war. The Israelis maintained close ties to the American espionageoracle until the end of his life. Several members of Mossad came to Angleton’shome as he lay dying in the spring of 1987, to pay their last respects—andperhaps to make certain the vapory Gray Ghost was indeed finally leaving thismortal coil.Dulles also put Angleton in charge of the CIA’s relationship with the FBI—adelicate task considering the rivalry between the two agencies. At the same timehe was working with the federal bureau in charge of fighting organized crime,Angleton was also pursuing a CIA partnership with the Mafia. Angleton possessedone of those rare intellects—and characters—that allowed him to lead a lifefilled with contradiction. He easily passed back and forth between Washington’soverworld and the criminal underworld. He was the sort of man who couldcrossbreed a new orchid, cook a delicious pasta with slivered truffles importedfrom Ristorante Passetto in Rome, and then sit down with a criminal mastermindto discuss the fine points of murder. Though he dined and drank with Georgetownhigh society, Angleton’s work also brought him into close contact with theagency’s rougher characters, including Shef Edwards’s security cops, who helpedinstall Angleton’s bugs, and Bill Harvey, the hard-drinking gun nut who figuredprominently in a number of the agency’s assassination jobs.It was all of a piece, in the intricately wired mind of Jim Angleton: counteringdangerous ideas by publishing CIA-vetted literature, or by eliminating theintellectuals and leaders who expounded these ideas. One day, shortly afterFidel Castro took power in Havana, Angleton had a brainstorm. He summoned twoJewish CIA officers, including Sam Halpern, who had recently been assigned tothe agency’s covert Cuba team. Angleton asked them to fly to Miami and meet withMeyer Lanksy, organized crime’s chief financial officer, who had been forced toflee Havana ahead of Castro’s revolutionaries, leaving behind the Mafia’s highlylucrative casino empire. Lansky was part of the Jewish mob but had closebusiness ties to the Italian Mafia. Angleton told Halpern and the other JewishCIA agent to see if they could convince Lansky to arrange for the assassinationof Castro.Angleton’s emissaries met with Lansky, but the crime mogul drove too hard abargain for his services and the deal fell through. This was only the beginningof the CIA’s endless, Ahab-like quest to kill the Caribbean leviathan, however.Castro would never stop haunting the dreams of the CIA high command. The Cubanrevolutionary was not only intellectually formidable and politically fearless;his dream of national liberation was backed up with guns. Castro and his equallycharismatic comrade, Che Guevara, made it clear from the start that they wouldnot share the fate of Jacobo Arbenz in Guatemala: they would fight fire withfire. Che, a twenty-five-year-old doctor and adventurer in search of a grandermeaning to his life, was living in Guatemala City when Arbenz was overthrown. Hesaw what happened when Arbenz’s moderate reforms came up against the imperialforce of United Fruit and the CIA.“I am not Christ or a philanthropist, old lady,” Che wrote to his mother, Celia,in the bantering style he had developed with her, as he and Fidel prepared toboard the leaky yacht Granma in Mexico with their band of guerrillas to makehistory in Cuba. “I fight for the things I believe in, with all the weapons atmy disposal and try to leave the other man dead so that I don’t get nailed to across.”To avoid Arbenz’s fate, Castro and Guevara would do everything he had not: putthe hard-core thugs of the old regime up against a wall, run the CIA’s agentsout of the country, purge the armed forces, and mobilize the Cuban people. Bymilitarizing their dream, Fidel and Che became an audacious threat to theAmerican empire. They represented the most dangerous revolutionary idea ofall—the one that refused to be crushed.It was after midnight, on September 20, 1960, when Fidel Castro came uptown toHarlem. The white, terra-cotta facade of the Hotel Theresa on Seventh Avenue andWest 125th Street—“the Waldorf of Harlem”—gleamed under a battery of policespotlights as brightly as a Hollywood movie premiere. Outside the hotelentrance, a boisterous crowd was steadily growing, in defiance of the peltingrain and the intimidating phalanx of policemen, awaiting the internationalpolitical celebrity who was rumored to be checking in. Suddenly a lusty roarwent up from the throng as an official-looking car suddenly glided to a stopoutside the hotel and the familiar, tall, bearded figure emerged from thevehicle. “Cuba si, Yanqui no!” shouted the crowd as a beaming Castro swept hisarms through the air, before being hustled into the hotel.The Cuban leader and his fifty-member delegation, who were in New York for theannual United Nations General Assembly meeting, had not received such a warmwelcome at their first choice of accommodations, the midtown Shelburne Hotel.When the Cuban delegation checked in two days earlier at the Shelburne, theywere greeted by a militant group of anti-Castro exiles calling itself La RosaBlanca (The White Rose), which threatened to blow up the hotel. The Shelburnemanagement promptly informed Castro’s party that they would need to put up a$20,000 security deposit, and an outraged Fidel, insisting that his governmentdid not have ready access to that kind of cash, announced that they would leavethe hotel and pitch tents outside the UN if necessary.Castro’s 1960 trip to New York marked a sharp turning point in U.S.-Cubarelations. The previous year, in April 1959, the Cuban leader had enjoyed a muchmore hospitable reception during his eleven-day visit to the United States.Fresh from his revolutionary victory on New Year’s Eve, Fidel was stillsomething of a political mystery to the Eisenhower administration, and the mediaembraced him as the silver-tongued conqueror who had liberated the Cuban peoplefrom Fulgencio Batista’s gangster reign. During his earlier visit to New York—acity he loved—Fidel roamed the streets followed by packs of reporters andphotographers, dropping by a Queens elementary school, where the children allwore cardboard cut-out beards in his honor, and the Bronx Zoo, where he gulpeddown a hot dog and an ice cream cone, and alarmed zoo guards by sticking hishand through the bars of a cage to pat the cheek of a Bengal tiger. “This islike prison—I have been in prison, too,” said Fidel, who had survived Batista’scages. Even the CIA seemed charmed by Castro during his 1959 visit. Aftermeeting with the Cuban leader in his New York hotel suite, an ecstatic CIA agentreported, “Castro is not only not a Communist, but he is a strong anti-communistfighter.”But there had been many changes over the following year, as Castro moved todeliver on the promise of the revolution, nationalizing the sugar and oilindustries, and beginning to transform Cuba from a vassal state of the UnitedStates to a sovereign nation. By early 1960, Dulles had resolved the debatewithin his intelligence agency over Castro’s true identity, deciding that he wasa dedicated Communist and a serious threat to U.S. security. The CIA director’shardening line mirrored that of friends in the business world like WilliamPawley, the globetrotting entrepreneur whose major investments in Cuban sugarplantations and Havana’s municipal transportation system were wiped out byCastro’s revolution. One of a coterie of vigorously anti-Communist internationalbusinessmen who provided the CIA with foreign information and contacts, as wellas guns and money, Pawley began lobbying the Eisenhower administration to takean aggressive stand against Castro when he was still fighting Batista’s soldiersin the rugged peaks of the Sierra Maestra. After Fidel rode into Havana on atank in January 1959, Pawley, who was gripped by what Eisenhower called a“pathological hatred for Castro,” even volunteered to pay for his assassination.As the Eisenhower administration took an increasingly belligerent posture towardthe Castro regime, Pawley found himself at the center of the action, boastingthat he was “in daily touch with Allen Dulles.”The Eisenhower administration responded to Castro’s expropriation ofAmerican-owned plantations, factories, and utilities by cutting imports of Cubansugar—the country’s economic lifeblood—and by launching a secret campaign aimedat sabotaging Castro’s government. In February 1960, mercenary pilots hired bythe CIA dropped bombs on Cuban sugar mills, and in March, a French freighterloaded with Belgian weapons was blown up in the Havana harbor, killing dozens ofsailors and stevedores. A second explosion killed many more, includingfirefighters and emergency medical workers, as they rushed to the scene. Thesame month, President Eisenhower approved a plan to train a paramilitary forceoutside of Cuba for a future invasion of the island. The operation, which wasspearheaded by Vice President Nixon and the CIA, would culminate the followingyear on the beaches of the Bay of Pigs.The explosion in Havana’s harbor was a milestone in the Cuban revolution. At afuneral ceremony the next day at Colon cemetery, an emotional Castro vowed that“Cuba will never become cowardly” in the face of U.S. aggression. He ended hisoration with the declaration that became a ringing slogan of the Cubanrevolution: Patrio o Muerte, Venceremos! (Motherland or Death, We Shall Win!)Determined that Cuba would not become another Guatemala, Castro turned to theSoviet Union for economic and military aid, and the tragic dance began, lockingCuba, the United States, and Russia in a fateful embrace for years to come, andnearly ending in a nuclear inferno.When Castro and his retinue landed at New York’s Idlewild Airport on September18, 1960, he appeared to be in a “subdued mood,” reported The New York Times,for reasons that were not yet known to the American people. The Cuban airlinerthat flew the delegation to the United States had to be immediately refueled andflown back to Havana, to avoid being impounded, as a result of legal claimsagainst the revolutionary government by U.S. business interests. It was just oneof the numerous ways that Castro’s delegation was subjected to harassment duringhis weeklong visit to New York, as the Eisenhower administration maneuveredagainst the Cuban leader on multiple fronts. By the time his retinue was forcedout of the Shelburne Hotel, Castro seemed persona non grata in New York. TheState Department had ruled that the Cubans could not leave Manhattan, and nocity hotel was willing to accommodate them. If New York was incapable ofproviding hospitality to world leaders, Castro fumed, perhaps the UN should bemoved to another city, such as Havana.But then Castro turned his humiliation into a propaganda triumph. As the Cubandelegation was preparing to leave the Shelburne, a political sympathizer putthem in touch with Black Muslim leader Malcolm X, who intervened on their behalfwith the operators of Hotel Theresa. The tallest building in Harlem, thethirteen-story hotel was a lofty—if somewhat worn-down—landmark in the blackcommunity. In its heyday, the Theresa had accommodated a glittering array ofAfrican American celebrities when they were not welcome at New York’s downtownhotels, including Josephine Baker, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Nat KingCole, and Lena Horne. In June 1938, Joe Louis celebrated his heavyweightchampionship victory over Max Schmeling, Nazi Germany’s great white hope, at theTheresa, as thousands of fans cheered on the streets outside.When word spread that the Cuban delegation was headed uptown, Love B. Woods,manager of the Theresa, immediately came under the same political pressures asother New York hotel operators. Even Harlem’s outspoken congressman, AdamClayton Powell Jr., opposed Castro’s relocation to Harlem, calling it “apublicity stunt.” Powell told reporters, “We Negro people have enough problemsof our own without the additional burden of Dr. Castro’s confusion.” But Woods,an elderly and unruffled man who had grown up in Jim Crow South Carolina, knewwhat it was like to be denied a roof over your head. Woods stood his ground andopened the doors of Harlem’s finest hotel to the Castro delegation. “We don’tdiscriminate against anybody,” he said.Other prominent figures in Harlem also stuck out their necks for Castro. Knowingthat Woods might have trouble cashing the Cubans’ check because of the risingpolitical tensions between the two countries, a Harlem attorney named ConradLynn arranged to have a local gambling kingpin put up $1,000 in cash to coverthe delegation’s hotel costs. The gangster was not “a communist or politicallydeveloped,” Lynn recalled, “but something told me that this was a man, and thathe wanted to help. And he did.”Young Harlem activists also rallied around Castro, like Preston Wilcox, who wasamong those cheering the Cuban leader outside the Theresa. Wilcox saw a“spiritual connection” between Fidel’s decision to come to Harlem and the risingdynamism of the civil rights movement. He noted the color division between theopposing lines of Cubans in the crowd: the black Cubans were pro-Castro, whilethose loudly denouncing him were lighter-shaded. Whenever Juan Almeida, Castro’sblack military commander and a hero of the revolution, left the hotel during thedelegation’s stay and went strolling through the neighborhood, enthusiasticcrowds swirled around him. The New York Citizen-Call, an African Americannewspaper, commented, “To Harlem’s oppressed ghetto dwellers, Castro was thatbearded revolutionary who . . . had told white America to go to hell.”Harlem’s show of hospitality for Castro turned out to be a public relationsdisaster for the Eisenhower administration. By moving to Harlem, the Cubanleader not only shamed the U.S. government for its lack of manners but focused asharp spotlight on the nation’s seething racial tensions. Some of the city’sfinest hotels suddenly offered entire floors to the Cuban delegation, free ofcharge, but Castro refused to move. When world leaders—including Khrushchev,Nasser, and Nehru—began coming uptown to meet with Castro, with TV camera crewsclose behind, Washington’s embarrassment only grew.Castro’s mastery of the media game was on full display during his Harlemsojourn. After Eisenhower snubbed him by not inviting him to an officialreception for Latin leaders, the Cuban premier responded by inviting Theresa’sall-black staff to a steak dinner in the hotel banquet room with him and thepopular Almeida. When articles suddenly began appearing in New York newspapers,alleging that the Theresa was overrun with hookers, Fidel again parried thepropaganda thrust, declaring in his speech at the UN, “They began spreading thenews all over the world that the Cuban delegation had lodged in a brothel. Forsome, a humble hotel in Harlem, a hotel inhabited by Negroes of the UnitedStates, must obviously be a brothel.”By the time he delivered his speech before the UN General Assembly on September26, Castro had seized the moral high ground in his growing war of words withWashington. His UN speech, a marathon performance that stretched for over fourhours, was a passionate defense of Cuba’s autonomy. For years, his colonizednation had no voice in world affairs, Castro told the international assembly.“Colonies do not speak. Colonies are not recognized in the world. That is whyour [nation] and its problems were unknown to the rest of the world. . . . Therewas no independent republic; there was only a colony where orders were given bythe ambassador of the United States.” But now, at long last, Castro was givingCuba a full-throated voice.What had his small, impoverished nation done to so offend its powerful neighbor,asked Castro? “We instituted an agrarian reform that would solve the problems ofthe landless peasants, that would solve the problem of the lack of basicfoodstuffs, that would solve the great unemployment problem on the land, thatwould end, once and for all, the ghastly misery which existed in the rural areasof our country.“Was it radical?” asked Castro, with the rhetorical skill he had mastered as ayoung lawyer, when his own life was on the line in Batista’s courtrooms. “It wasnot very radical. . . . We were not 150 percent communists at the time. We justappeared slightly pink. We were not confiscating lands. We simply proposed topay for them in 20 years, and the only way we could afford to pay for them wasby bonds—bonds which would mature in twenty years, at 4.5 percent interest,which would accumulate annually.” See, Castro was telling the world,revolutionary Cuba had been willing to play by capitalist rules. But this wasnot enough for Washington. Cuba’s new government “had been too bold. It hadclashed with the international mining trusts, it had clashed with the interestsof United Fruit Company, and it had clashed with the most powerful interests ofthe United States. So then the example shown by the Cuban revolution had toreceive its punishment. Punitive actions of every type—even the destruction ofCuba’s foolhardy people—had to be carried out against the audacity of therevolutionary government.”Journalist I. F. Stone pronounced Castro’s oration—which he delivered, hourafter hour, by consulting just a single page of notes—a “tour de force.” It wasunlike anything ever heard before in the United Nations: a scholarly, eloquent,and heartfelt broadside against the arrogance of imperial power, delivered inthe capital of world finance, by a charismatic rebel leader who had risked hislife to challenge that power. If Allen Dulles’s imperial guard still had anydoubts about how serious a threat Fidel Castro represented, his dramaticperformance at the UN that day thoroughly dispelled them.The CIA knew how seductive Fidel’s appeal was—even in the West, particularlyamong college students, intellectuals, and artists. In April 1960, RobertTaber—the first African American reporter for CBS News, who had scored anexclusive interview with Castro when he was still fighting in themountains—stirred liberal circles by purchasing a full-page ad in The New YorkTimes that passionately endorsed the Cuban revolution. The appeal was signed byan impressive list of literary names—including Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone deBeauvoir, Norman Mailer, James Baldwin, and Truman Capote—and sparked a wave ofpopular interest in the Cuban cause that led to the formation of the Fair Playfor Cuba Committee (FPCC). Within six months, the committee had enrolled seventhousand members in twenty-seven “adult chapters” across the country and hadstruck a chord on college campuses, where forty student councils were formed.While Castro was staying at the Theresa, the FPCC organized a party in his honorin the hotel’s shabby ballroom. Among the guests were Allen Ginsberg, LangstonHughes, and C. Wright Mills, whose own impassioned defense of the Cubanrevolution, Listen, Yankee, had sold four hundred thousand copies within months.Mills’s book was based on his brief tour of the island, including threeeighteen-hour days in the indefatigable company of Fidel, a man who, in thewords of his friend Gabriel García Márquez, was “addicted to the habit ofconversation . . . he rests by talking.”These were the early, honeymoon days of the revolution, before Castro’s caudillotendencies had hardened, and before the Soviet “partnership” with Cuba hadbecome its own kind of colonialism. The relentless U.S. pressure on the islandwould never succeed in toppling Castro, but it would help turn his nation intothe tropical police state that CIA propagandists insisted it was from the verybeginning, amounting to a victory of sorts for Washington hard-liners.But there was still a glow around Castro as he and his retinue settled into theHotel Theresa. It was the dawn of the 1960s, the gray Eisenhower-Dulles reignwas coming to an end, and the world seemed to shimmer with new possibilities.The most electric moment of Castro’s week in Harlem came one evening whenMalcolm X—wearing a long, double-breasted, black leather coat and tie—swept pastthe press pack in the hotel lobby and was whisked to Fidel’s suite on the ninthfloor. Fidel invited Malcolm to sit next to him on the bed, the only comfortableoasis in a room thick with cigar smoke and crowded with aides, bodyguards, and afew specially selected members of the African American press. The tworevolutionary icons seemed hesitant with each other at first, theircommunication made precarious by their language differences. But as Castroplunged ahead with his uncertain English, they slowly found common ground. Fideltold Malcolm that the Cubans appreciated the warm reception given them inHarlem. “I think you will find the people in Harlem are not so addicted to thepropaganda they dish out downtown,” Malcolm replied.Castro’s young foreign minister, Raúl Roa Kourí, later said that he thought themeeting between the two revolutionaries, though lasting only a half hour, turnedout to be historically significant because it helped broaden the Black Muslimleader’s narrow racial parameters. Malcolm began to understand that blacks werenot the only poor and oppressed group, said Kourí, “and the struggle of all wasa common struggle.” Afterward, Malcolm maintained a strong interest in the Cubanrevolution, saying, “The only white person that I have really liked was Fidel.”He planned to visit Cuba but never had the chance.The meeting between Fidel and Malcolm sent shudders through U.S. securitycircles, where a potential alliance between the Cuban revolutionary and themilitant black nationalist was seen as the stuff of nightmares. Malcolm’sbroadening political outlook, which accelerated after his split with the Nationof Islam in 1964, made him an increasingly dangerous figure—and Kourí, amongothers, was convinced that it led to his assassination in 1965. By 1960, Malcolmwas the target of intensive FBI surveillance. In fact, one of the people who hadsqueezed into Castro’s hotel bedroom that evening was an undercover FBI agent,who later reported back to the bureau on the two men’s conversation. Accordingto a confidential FBI memo based on the source’s report, Malcolm told Fidel thathe was predisposed to like him, because “usually when one sees a man whom theUnited States is against, there is something good in that man.”By the time Castro came to Harlem, he, too, was the target of increasinglyominous U.S. intelligence scrutiny. Just days before the Cuban delegationchecked into Hotel Theresa, Bob Maheu—on orders of the CIA—met at anotherManhattan hotel with Johnny Rosselli, the handsome, silver-haired Mafia lord whopresided over the underworld’s Las Vegas empire, to develop a plan toassassinate Castro. Maheu and Rosselli were joined at the Plaza Hotel meeting byJim O’Connell, Maheu’s handler in the CIA security office. O’Connell posed as anAmerican businessman who had been dispossessed by Castro’s revolution and waswilling to pay for his elimination. But the savvy Rosselli was not fooled: hequickly figured out that the Mafia was being recruited for a top secretgovernment assignment.Once again, Bob Maheu found himself at the center of a lethal CIA operation.Near the end of his life, he recalled what he went through when the CIA askedhim to serve as the main emissary with the Mafia in the Castro assassinationplot. Sitting with two visitors in his ranch house on the edge of a Las Vegasgolf course, sipping vodka on the rocks as golf balls periodically clunked offthe roof, Maheu recounted a long night of soul-searching as he wrestled with theCIA request. Shef Edwards and Jim O’Connell framed their pitch to Maheu in termsa good Catholic would understand—killing Castro was an act of “just war,” theysaid; it would save thousands of lives. They made it clear that the executionorder came from the top of the agency, from Old Man Dulles himself. Nonetheless,Maheu realized that he would “have blood on [his] hands.”To ponder the morally difficult question, Maheu went down to the recreation roomin the basement of his Virginia home, where he made all of his big decisions,and listened all night long to classical music on the state-of-the-art soundsystem that the CIA had installed for him. In conversation with his visitorsyears later, Maheu tried to make it seem like his decision was a torturedprocess. But it actually sounded like a relative no-brainer for the securitycontractor. The CIA had made Bob Maheu’s career—he owed everything to theagency, even the extravagant stereo system that made his Bach and Glenn Millerrecords sound like they were “coming out of everywhere, even the waste paperbaskets.” He wasn’t about to give it all up to spare the life of a bearded,bombastic Cuban revolutionary. Maheu told the CIA yes. When it came down to it,he didn’t mind having Castro’s blood on his hands, or that of his brother RaúlCastro and Che Guevara, for that matter.It was the beginning of a long U.S. intelligence campaign to kill the Cubanleader, stretching over several presidencies and involving untold numbers ofaccomplices—including mobsters, soldiers of fortune, disaffected members of theHavana regime, and security contractors like Maheu.As Castro prepared to return home at the end of his tumultuous week in New York,he gave a spirited press conference at the airport. Why was the Cuban delegationdeparting on a Soviet jet, a reporter shouted? Because the United States hadimpounded all of Cuba’s airliners as a result of claims against his government,he responded. “What do you want us to do?” Castro asked plaintively. “You leaveus without petroleum—Khrushchev gives us petroleum. You [cut] our sugar[imports]—Khrushchev buys our sugar. . . . You take away our planes—Khrushchevgives us his plane.”The CIA knew what it wanted Castro to do. Shortly after the Cuban leader arrivedhome in Havana, as he addressed a teeming crowd from the balcony of thePresidential Palace, a bomb went off in the park behind the palace, followed bya second explosion within the hour. Later in the day, a third bomb—more powerfulthan the other two—rocked Havana. The CIA-sponsored terror campaign aimed atkilling Castro and destroying his government was quickly escalating.Two weeks after Fidel Castro checked out of the Hotel Theresa, another youngdynamo made an appearance at the hotel. On the afternoon of October 12, 1960,Senator John F. Kennedy brought his presidential campaign to Harlem, speaking toa large crowd from a platform erected in front of the hotel. Kennedy was wellaware that Castro had just put the Harlem hotel on the world map. JFK wasfascinated by the charismatic Cuban, whose biography bore some resemblance tohis own. Both men were the products of Catholic immigrant families who hadworked their way up to wealth and success (Castro’s father had immigrated fromSpain); both were the second sons of shrewd, entrepreneurial fathers and devoutmothers; both were educated at elite schools; and both had rejected their classprivilege, dedicating themselves to improving the lives of those less fortunateand to making their countries beacons of change.After Castro’s triumph over Batista, Kennedy had warm words for the victoriousrevolutionary, declaring, “Fidel Castro is part of the legacy of Bolivar, wholed his men over the Andes Mountains vowing ‘war to the death’ against Spanishrule.” The young senator criticized the Eisenhower administration for not givingCastro a more friendly greeting “in his hour of triumph” when he visitedWashington in April 1959.But during the presidential campaign, Kennedy, determined not to be tarred byNixon as soft on the global Communist threat, carved out a position on Cuba thatwas even more militant than the Republican candidate’s, declaring that Castrohad “betrayed the ideals of the Cuban revolution” and calling his regime “aCommunist menace that has been permitted to arise under our very noses, only 90miles from our shores.” Kennedy went so far as to suggest that the United Statesshould take decisive action to remove the threat. His militant campaign rhetoricevoked a heated response from Castro during his epic UN speech, who called JFKan “illiterate and ignorant millionaire” with no understanding of Cuba’s plight.In truth, Kennedy was keenly aware of Cuba’s colonial history and wasoutspokenly critical of how U.S. business interests had despoiled the country.In the same campaign speech in which he attacked Castro as a “dangerous enemy onour very doorstep,” JFK ripped into America’s corporate plunder and politicaldomination of the island in surprisingly unvarnished terms. He also denouncedWashington’s shameful practice of “propping up dictators throughout LatinAmerica,” including the “bloody and repressive” Batista.Kennedy’s campaign rhetoric on Cuba revealed a man who was painstakingly tryingto work out the correct position for himself—and his country—on therevolutionary convulsions that were shaking the world. He did not want to appearnaïve about Communist exploitation of these national liberation movements. Buthe was even more concerned that the United States be on the right side ofhistory, by supporting the aspirations of the peoples of Latin America, Africa,and Asia as they threw off their colonial shackles.On that brisk fall day outside the Hotel Theresa, where Kennedy was joined onthe platform by a formidable supporting cast of Democratic dignitaries,including Eleanor Roosevelt and Congressman Powell, the presidential contendersounded more like a supporter of the bearded revolutionary in whose wake he wasfollowing than an enemy. “I am happy to come to this hotel, a little late, but Iam happy to come here,” he began, to loud applause from the crowd. “Behind thefact of Castro coming to this hotel, Khrushchev coming to Castro, there isanother great traveler in the world, and that is the travel of a worldrevolution, a world in turmoil. I am delighted to come to Harlem and I think thewhole world should come here and the whole world should recognize that we alllive right next to each other, whether here in Harlem or on the other side ofthe globe. We should be glad [that Castro and Khrushchev] came to the UnitedStates. We should not fear the twentieth century, for the worldwide revolutionwhich we see all around us is part of the original American revolution.”The man who was soon to become America’s youngest elected president showedHarlem that day that he, too, could deliver a speech—perhaps with less fire thanCastro, but with equal passion and vision, and a bit more wit. Declaring thatAmerica’s revolutionary ideals continued to inspire people throughout the world,Kennedy said, “There are children in Africa called George Washington. There arechildren in Africa called Thomas Jefferson. There are none called Lenin orTrotsky or Stalin in the Congo . . . or Nixon. There may be a couple called AdamPowell,” he added, to loud laughter from the audience, which was well aware ofthe congressman’s reputation for womanizing.America could not continue to inspire the world, Kennedy went on, unless it“practiced what it preaches” at home. “If a Negro baby is born here and a whitebaby is born next door, the Negro baby’s chance of finishing high school isabout 60 percent of the white baby. This baby’s chance of getting throughcollege is about a third of that baby’s. His chance of being unemployed is fourtimes that baby’s.” All that must change, JFK told the audience. “White peopleare a minority in the world,” he said. They could no longer hold back the dreamsof the rest of the world. Kennedy vowed that if he were elected, he would alignAmerica with the winds of change. “I believe it is important that the presidentof the United States personify the ideals of our society, speak out on this,associate ourselves with the great fight for equality.”In the next three years, as Cuba became the flaming focal point of U.S. foreignpolicy, Kennedy would continue to wrestle with his relationship to Castro andthe revolutionary change that he represented. As president, JFK’s posture onCuba gradually softened, with the White House inching awkwardly toward a stateof peaceful coexistence with the neighbor whom Kennedy once called “dangerous.”The fitful process of rapprochement with Cuba would set off a turbulent reactionin Washington, particularly within the national security circles still dominatedby Dulles hard-liners. In these men’s minds, it was not just Havana that loomedas a hotbed of dangerous ideas, it was the Kennedy White House."},{"pageContent":"14 [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-33]THE TORCH IS PASSED [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-33]The cruel circus of American politics has a way of exposing a candidate’s innerself, particularly the hurly-burly of congressional campaigns, where the battleis fought up close and on one’s home turf. Allen Dulles briefly threw himselfinto the political arena in August 1938, when he declared himself a candidate inthe Republican primary for the Sixteenth Congressional District, on Manhattan’sUpper East Side, where he and Clover maintained a town house. Like Foster, wholater ran a similarly ill-fated campaign for the U.S. Senate, Allen had anuanced feel for power but not for politics. The brothers were imbued with asense of public service, but in their minds, democracy was something to be savedfrom the demos. “Democracy works only if the so-called intelligent people makeit work,” Allen told the press on the eve of his campaign. “You can’t sit backand let democracy run itself.”Dulles’s patrician sensibility did not play well in the campaign, even with theposh Republican voters on the Upper East Side. During the race, he put togetherall of the right elements, like a corporate lawyer meticulously building hiscase. He lined up the support of prestigious Republicans, such as Elihu RootJr., the son of Teddy Roosevelt’s secretary of state, who served as his honorarycampaign chairman. He secured the endorsements of the leading New Yorknewspapers, including the Times and the Herald Tribune. And he opened up acampaign office at the Belmont Plaza Hotel, where Clover dutifully wrote severalhundred letters soliciting support from women voters in the district, like aJunior League doyenne volunteering for a favorite charity. But there was nopassion in the Dulles campaign. His speeches were stilted and his debateperformance was lawyerly and bloodless.The monthlong primary campaign pitted Dulles against the incumbent, aconservative Democratic congressman named John J. O’Connor, who had cross-filedin the Republican primary after President Roosevelt announced his intention topurge O’Connor as a traitor to the New Deal. During the brief race, Dulles triedto carefully parse his attacks on the popular president, expressing sympathywith FDR’s “broad social aims” while denouncing his “dictatorial attitude.” ButO’Connor—who had established himself as one of the more effective opponents ofthe New Deal in Congress—came across as a more muscular enemy of Roosevelt. Andwhen the battle-scarred political warhorse turned his invective on Dulles,accusing him of “selling out” his country to “international interests” and WallStreet titans like J. Pierpont Morgan, Dulles could only muster arational-sounding, but feeble, reply.On Election Day, September 21, Dulles went down to a thumping defeat, losing theRepublican nomination by a three-to-two margin to a man who did not even belongto the party. Dulles promptly returned to the world of discreet power that heknew best, never again subjecting himself to the slings and arrows of electoralcombat.On the surface, John F. Kennedy seemed similarly unsuited for therough-and-tumble of democracy. Privileged, reserved, and physically frail, youngJack Kennedy was a far cry from his glad-handing political forebears, such ashis maternal grandfather, John “Honey Fitz” Fitzgerald, the perennial Bostonpolitician who wooed voters with his gift for song and blarney. Late into hiscareer, JFK continued to worry that he was too introverted for politics. InJanuary 1960, three days after declaring his presidential candidacy, Kennedyconfided to friends over dinner, “I’m not a political type.” In contrast to hisgrandfather, who “wanted to talk to everybody,” added Kennedy, “I’d rather reada book on a plane than talk to the fellow next to me.”When he made his political debut in 1946, running for Congress from theBoston-Cambridge Eleventh District, the twenty-eight-year-old Kennedy was farfrom a shoo-in, despite his father’s wealth and connections. The sprawlingdistrict encompassed a slew of tough Irish and Italian working-classneighborhoods and slums, and the Choate- and Harvard-educated candidate seemedtoo aloof a character to outrun the crowded pack of experienced political prosthat he faced in the Democratic primary. Joe Kennedy tried to outfit his sonwith the best campaign brain trust that money could buy, but JFK preferred towork with young war veterans like himself. Jack Kennedy sought out Dave Powers,an Air Force veteran who had grown up in scruffy, Irish-Catholic Charlestown andwas a local political wise guy. The son of a dockworker who had died when Powerswas two, leaving his widow with eight children to raise, the political operatorknew the dreams and heartaches of the families crowded into the neighborhood’s“three-decker” tenements. Powers ushered five masses every Sunday at St.Catherine’s Church and played second base on the parish baseball team. “I knewjust about everybody in Charlestown.”When Kennedy first approached him in a Charlestown tavern to ask him to join hiscampaign, Powers turned him down flat. A millionaire’s son running for Congressin a shot-and-beer district? He didn’t stand a chance. Kennedy didn’t seem cutout for Boston’s brawling politics. In fact, the young man—who would soon bediagnosed with Addison’s disease and told that he would not live pastforty-five—did not seem long for this world. As the 1946 campaign got under way,Kennedy was plagued by severe back and abdominal distress that he had sufferedever since he was a teenager and had been aggravated during his war service inthe South Pacific, where he had also picked up a case of malaria. He waspainfully thin and his skin had an unhealthy, yellow tinge—whether from theatabrine he took for his malaria or from his Addison’s, it was unclear.Kennedy’s shy manner and boyish good looks made him seem more a poet than apolitician to Powers, but he soon discovered that JFK was “aggressively shy.”Even after Powers turned him down over drinks at the bar, Kennedy kept dogginghim, showing up a few nights later at his family’s three-decker flat andpeppering him with questions. Well, if YOU were running in the district, whatwould YOU do? “He was very inquisitive. He could pick your mind.”A few days later, when Kennedy invited him to come to his first campaignappearance, Dave Powers gave in to his political destiny. JFK was addressing agroup of Gold Star mothers—women who had lost sons during the war—at theCharlestown American Legion Hall. As Kennedy began to speak, a polite hush fellover the crowd. Powers stood listening in the back of the room, and at first thepolitical operator—who was used to the stem-winding oratory of Boston legendslike James Michael Curley—cringed at what he was hearing. The young candidatewas painfully nervous, stuttering and visibly struggling for a way to connectwith his audience. And then, it happened. Kennedy—whose own family had lost itsfirstborn son, Joseph Patrick Kennedy Jr., in the final days of the war—foundhis voice. “I was getting sort of nervous,” recalled Powers years later, “andthen [Jack] looked out at all these wonderful ladies and said, ‘I think I knowhow you feel, because my mother is a Gold Star mother too.’ And all the yearsI’ve been in politics, smoke-filled rooms and from Maine to Anchorage, Alaska,this reaction was unbelievable. He immediately was surrounded by all theseCharlestown mothers and in the background I can hear them saying he reminds meof my own John or Joe or Pat, a loved one they had lost. Even I wasoverwhelmed.”After the event, as they walked back to Kennedy’s hotel suite, in an oldpolitical hangout on Beacon Street, the young candidate asked Powers how he haddone. “It was great,” said Powers.“And then he reached out his hand and said, ‘Then will you be with me?’ And Ishook his hand and I was with him from that day to Dallas.’”Kennedy went on to win the Democratic primary and the general election bylandslides. He spent the rest of his life in politics, a profession he regardedas honorable and at which he displayed a unique talent, even if he never feltentirely comfortable with its showmanship. As he prepared to run for president,he expressed hope that the country was ready for a new style of politics.Perhaps you didn’t have to be a backslapping “happy warrior” like HubertHumphrey, a leading rival for the 1960 Democratic nomination. “I just don’tthink you have to have that type of personality to be successful today inpolitics,” JFK told friends, a bit wishfully, early in his campaign. “I thinkyou have to be able to communicate a sense of conviction and intelligence andrather, some integrity. . . . Those three qualities are really it.”Every great life in politics has a theme: with John Kennedy, it was his horrorof war and the endless suffering it brings. He felt it in a way that mostpoliticians, blithely untouched by the savagery and idiocy of war, never feelit. “All war is stupid,” Kennedy had written home as a naval lieutenant in theSouth Pacific, where he had nearly lost his own life when his PT boat was carvedin two by a Japanese destroyer. The death of his older brother only confirmedhis deep disgust with war. “He was very close to my brother Joe, and it was adevastating loss to him personally,” recalled Senator Edward M. Kennedy, JFK’syoungest brother, near the end of his life. “He was a very different person whenhe came back from the war. I think this burned inside of him.”Allen Dulles had also felt the personal impact of war, when his son and namesakereturned from Korea irreparably damaged. But his own family tragedy provoked nodeep agonizing within Dulles about war or his central role in Washington’smachinery of violence. The spymaster liked to talk, in a way that sounded almostboastful, about his ability to dispatch men—including his own loyal agents—totheir deaths. In contrast, during his years in the White House, Kennedycontinually wrestled with ways to avoid bloodshed, again and again deflectingbelligerent counsel from his national security advisers. Dulles came to see thisas weakness, while Kennedy would conclude that his CIA director was a man of thepast, recklessly provoking Cold War confrontations when the world was crying outfor a new vision. Though it was largely hidden from the public, the duel betweenKennedy and Dulles would define Washington’s “deep politics” in the early 1960s.Dulles first met Kennedy in winter 1954, while JFK was at his family’s PalmBeach mansion recovering from another agonizing round of back surgery. Thefreshman senator from Massachusetts, who had not yet made much of a politicalmark, did not strike the graying Washington power fixture as the sort of manwith whom he would one day cross swords. Kennedy was so enfeebled from hislatest surgical ordeal—which had put him in a coma, prompting a priest toadminister the last rites—that he could barely hobble a few steps. He lay in bedmost days, with nurses helping to turn him, reading, and taking notes for anarticle that would grow into his bestselling book, Profiles in Courage.From an early age, Kennedy’s afflictions had given him an acute sense of hisfragile mortality. “At least one half of the days that he spent on this earth,”his brother Robert later observed, “were days of intense physical pain.” Aspresident, JFK came to represent the very picture of youthful vigor andpolitical revitalization. But in private, particularly during periods of extremephysical distress, Kennedy seemed to belong as much to the afterlife as to theliving. In October 1953, while relaxing on Cape Cod after their wedding, Kennedyrecited his favorite poem to his new wife, Jacqueline, “I Have a Rendezvous withDeath.” Written by a young American poet named Alan Seeger—the uncle of folksinger Pete Seeger—before he died in battle in World War I, the poem spoke tothe shadows in Kennedy’s soul, even in the bloom of marriage to a beautiful andvivacious young woman:God knows ’twere better to be deepPillowed in silk and scented down,Where love throbs out in blissful sleep,Pulse nigh to pulse, and breath to breath,Where hushed awakenings are dear . . .But I’ve a rendezvous with DeathAt midnight in some flaming town,When Spring trips north again this year,And I to my pledged word am true,I shall not fail that rendezvous.Dulles was a frequent houseguest of the Kennedys’ Palm Beach neighbors, Charlesand Jayne Wrightsman. Charlie Wrightsman was a globe-trotting oil millionairewho had met his much younger wife when he was pushing fifty and she was atwenty-four-year-old department store swimsuit model. Under his bullyingtutelage, Jayne Wrightsman grew into a world-renowned art collector and highsociety hostess who would mentor Jacqueline Kennedy during the First Lady’selaborate restoration of the White House.Charlie Wrightsman was a blunt-spoken former oil wildcatter whose ruggedlyRepublican values were right out of the pages of Ayn Rand. Wrightsman andDulles, who served as the oilman’s attorney when he worked at Sullivan andCromwell, forged a tight, mutually beneficial friendship. Wrightsman generouslyshared his lavish lifestyle with the less affluent Dulles, inviting theintelligence chief for frequent winter retreats at his Spanish-style estate inPalm Beach, with its Renoirs and Vermeers and its parquet floors acquired fromthe Palais Royal in Paris. The oil baron also sometimes enticed Dulles to joinhis wife and him on their yachting expeditions in the Mediterranean as well astheir aviation adventures in their Learstar jet. “Jayne and I are leaving Parison Thursday August 20 for Stavanger, Norway and points North,” Wrightsman wroteDulles in July 1953 from the Hotel du Cap d’Antibes. “If you will join us, Iwill promise not to mention during our entire cruise that Senator McCarthy mightbe the next President of the United States.”Dulles, in turn, opened doors for Wrightsman in far-flung oil capitals likeBaghdad and Tripoli, providing him with introductions to ambassadors, governmentministers, and sheikhs. The oilman made sure to keep the spy chief in the loop,reporting back to him on the political intrigues in Europe and the Middle East.Clover resented the way that her husband slid so easily into the lap of luxuryprovided by millionaires like Wrightsman. Spending time in this gildedatmosphere brought out all of Clover’s mixed feelings about the world ofprivilege, a world where Allen served but did not fully belong.“The mere mention of the Wrightsmans,” recalled Mary Bancroft near the end ofher life, “was apt to set off one of those fights [between Dulles and his wife]when they went at each other like a pair of fighting eagles—with Clover alwaysbeing defeated by Allen’s stronger claws, until she retreated from the fray withfeathers awry and deep wounds from those claws. It was terrible to witness howthey fought.”Clover blamed the Wrightsmans for bringing out her husband’s “more reprehensiblecharacteristics,” Bancroft observed, “namely . . . that he liked good food, goodwine, and the chance to swim in a heated pool and afterwards to dry himself witha large, soft, expensive towel that had been warmed ahead of time ‘so you won’tget a shock.’ Clover liked luxury herself, but she certainly fought this‘weakness’ tooth and nail and was always forcing herself to do uncomfortable andunpleasant things that she thought ‘good for the soul,’ like the most rigid ofthe Puritan fathers.”It was the Wrightsmans who introduced the Dulleses to young Jack Kennedy.Charlie Wrightsman was no fan of the New Dealer Joe Kennedy, but he and his wifefound themselves charmed by Jack and Jackie, who seemed to have the air ofAmerican royalty. Years later, after JFK was dead, Dulles recalled the day inearly 1954 that he met the young senator. Invited by Joe Kennedy to drop by thefamily’s Palm Beach home while he was staying with the Wrightsmans, Dulles firstcame upon JFK as he was flat on his back. “He was suffering a good deal of pain,and he was lying on the sofa there in the study in Joe Kennedy’s house,” Dullesremembered, “and that was the first time that I saw him.” As the two mendiscussed various international hot spots, JFK would get up from time to time,wincing with pain, and gingerly walk a few paces before returning to the sofa.“He obviously wanted to learn,” said Dulles.On another occasion, JFK was invited to dinner at the Wrightsmans’ when bothDulles brothers were in attendance. “Jack Kennedy was quite a modest man inthose days,” recalled the CIA chief. “I remember my brother was there [and] Idon’t say [Kennedy] was overawed, but he was very respectful.”Thus began a relationship that Dulles regarded as tutorial—the education of apromising young man who had the proper regard for his elders. “He was alwaystrying to get information—I don’t mean secrets or things of that kind,particularly, but to get himself informed. He wanted to get my views, and whenmy brother was there, his views on what we thought about things, and we hadmany, many talks together.” This, in Dulles’s mind, was the proper order ofthings—Kennedy as prince and acolyte and the Dulles brothers as court regents.If Dulles’s attitude toward young Kennedy was condescending, his wife was awed.Clover’s first real opportunity to become acquainted with JFK came in August1955, when she and Allen were vacationing with the Wrightsmans on the beaches ofsouthern France. “At Antibes, we did the usual thing,” Clover wrote to AllenJr., “sitting in the cabana, swimming, eating good meals at good restaurants.”But the most memorable occasion, she wrote, took place when they dined with theKennedy clan, who were also on holiday in France. “Joe Kennedy’s son, theSenator, was there. He is 36 [actually he was 38], but looks no older than acollege boy, is nice looking and so straight forward, sincere, intelligent andattractive and likeable that I haven’t been so enthusiastic about anybody forages.” The aging Dulles, who still regarded himself as something of a ladies’man, must have found his wife’s schoolgirl crush on the young senator somewhatunnerving. But JFK also brought out tender, motherly feelings in Clover, callingto mind her own disabled son. “We talked of you,” Clover wrote Allen Jr., “forhe too was wounded and only last winter had some operation on his back so thathe was on crutches.” Talking with the bright, boyishly handsome, and attentivesenator must have reminded Clover of what could have been if her own son had notbeen so badly hurt in Korea.The Dulles brothers were slow to realize that if young Senator Kennedy was theirpupil, he was an increasingly rebellious one. Kennedy began questioning therigid Cold War paradigm that dominated Washington policy-making as early as1951, when he undertook a fact-finding mission to Asia while still acongressman. His stopover in Vietnam, where the French colonial regime wasstruggling to put down a growing national rebellion led by Ho Chi Minh, made aparticularly deep impression on Kennedy. When he landed in Saigon, the U.S.congressman with the prominent family name was immediately swarmed by Frenchofficials, but he slipped away and met with independent-thinking diplomats andjournalists. Saigon was a city on the edge when JFK arrived in October 1951,with explosions rumbling in the distance, French agents whisking suspects offthe streets at night, and headless bodies found floating in the Saigon River bymorning. At the rooftop restaurant of the Hotel Majestic, overlooking thegaslit, Parisian-tinged streets below, Kennedy met with an astute Americanembassy officer named Edmund Gullion. The diplomat told the inquisitivecongressman that the French would never win. He said that Ho Chi Minh—who hadonce worked as a baker at JFK’s favorite Boston hotel, the Parker House, and whowas inspired by the blazing ideals of the American Revolution—was seen as anational hero. Ho had awakened thousands of his fellow Vietnamese, who wouldrather die than continue to live under their French colonial masters.By April 1954, when Kennedy stood up on the Senate floor to challenge theEisenhower administration’s support for the doomed French war in Vietnam, he hadbecome an informed critic of Western imperialism. Even as France headed towardits Waterloo at Dien Bien Phu that spring, the Eisenhower administrationinsisted that massive U.S. military aid and firepower could help turn the tidefor the embattled French forces. But, as Kennedy told the U.S. Senate, “to pourmoney, materiel and men into the jungle of Indochina . . . would be dangerouslyfutile and self-destructive.” The young senator had a much firmer grasp of therealities of national insurgencies than Eisenhower and his aging secretary ofstate. “I am frankly of the belief that no amount of American militaryassistance in Indochina can conquer an enemy which is everywhere and at the sametime nowhere, ‘an enemy of the people’ which has the sympathy and covert supportof the people.” History would soon prove him right.Kennedy had an instinctive sympathy for the downtrodden subjects of imperialpowers, one that was rooted in his Irish heritage. His political rhetoric oftenreverberated with extra passion when he addressed the subject of popularuprisings against imperial rule.In July 1957, Kennedy once more took a strong stand against French colonialism,this time France’s bloody war against Algeria’s independence movement, whichagain found the Eisenhower administration on the wrong side of history. Risingon the Senate floor, two days before America’s Independence Day, Kennedydeclared,The most powerful single force in the world today is neither communism norcapitalism, neither the H-bomb nor the guided missile—it is man’s eternal desireto be free and independent. The great enemy of that tremendous force of freedomis called, for want of a more precise term, imperialism—and today that meansSoviet imperialism and, whether we like it or not, and though they are not to beequated, Western imperialism. Thus, the single most important test of Americanforeign policy today is how we meet the challenge of imperialism, what we do tofurther man’s desire to be free. On this test more than any other, this nationshall be critically judged by the uncommitted millions in Asia and Africa, andanxiously watched by the still hopeful lovers of freedom behind the IronCurtain. If we fail to meet the challenge of either Soviet or Westernimperialism, then no amount of foreign aid, no aggrandizement of armaments, nonew pacts or doctrines or high-level conferences can prevent further setbacks toour course and to our security.Kennedy’s speech was a bold challenge to the Eisenhower-Dulles worldview, whichinterpreted all international events through the prism of the Cold War, andallowed no space for developing nations to pursue their own path to progress.Breaking from the Cold War orthodoxy that prevailed in the Democratic as well asRepublican parties, JFK suggested that Soviet expansionism was not the onlyenemy of world freedom; so, too, were the forces of Western imperialism thatcrushed the legitimate aspirations of people throughout the Third World.Kennedy’s thinking about the historical imperative of Third World liberation wasremarkably advanced. Even today, no nationally prominent leader in the UnitedStates would dare question the imperialistic policies that have led our countryinto one military nightmare after another. Kennedy understood that Washington’smilitant opposition to the world’s revolutionary forces would only reap “abitter harvest.” If the United States stifled these legitimate forces ofnational self-determination, he said, then rising generations around the globewould be left with a grim choice “between radicalism and feudalism.”Kennedy’s Algeria speech was a political bombshell. Ike sounded off about JFK’sspeech at a cabinet meeting, sourly commenting, “That’s fine—everybody likesindependence. We can all make brilliant speeches. But these things are ratherdifficult problems, and maybe somebody ought to make a speech to remind thesenator that they’re not so easy.” Eisenhower began referring to Kennedy as“that little bastard.” Meanwhile, Secretary Dulles icily told the press that ifthe senator from Massachusetts wanted to crusade against imperialism, maybe heshould target the Soviet variety.JFK brushed aside the Eisenhower and Dulles criticisms as predictable croaksfrom Washington’s ancien régime. Kennedy had little respect for Eisenhower,seeing him as a disengaged leader who would rather play golf with hismillionaire cronies than confront the world’s emerging new realities. “I couldunderstand if he played golf all the time with old Army friends,” Kennedy oncetold Arthur Schlesinger, “but no man is less loyal to his old friends thanEisenhower. He is a terribly cold man. All his golfing pals are rich men he hasmet since 1945.” As for Foster, Kennedy dismissed him as an aging pontificatorwho saw the world through slogans—simplistic axioms like “godless Communism” and“Soviet master plan” that seemed increasingly “false . . . or irrelevant to thenew phase of competitive coexistence in which we live.”While Kennedy’s denunciation of French colonialism in Algeria brought sharprebukes at home—even from Democratic standard-bearers like Adlai Stevenson, whocalled it “terrible,” and The New York Times, which found the speechinsufficiently “delicate”—it stirred hopes overseas, particularly in Africa, acontinent swept by the anticolonial tempest. Dignitaries from African countriesbegan calling regularly on Kennedy at his Capitol Hill offices, praising him forhis “courageous position” on Algeria (in the words of an Angolan revolutionary).One of the senator’s aides had to spend much of her time trying to find housingin segregated Washington for the steady stream of African visitors.If Room 362 of the Senate Office Building was becoming a center of Africanaspiration, the Eisenhower administration remained a reactionary bastion. Thepresident and his top advisers were convinced that the African people were notready to take responsibility for their own affairs, and that any revolutionarymischief on the continent would only play into Communist hands. At one NationalSecurity Council meeting, Vice President Nixon observed, “Some of the peoples ofAfrica have been out of trees for only about 50 years,” to which Budget DirectorMaurice Stans (who would later serve as President Nixon’s commerce secretary)replied that he “had the impression that many Africans still belonged in trees.”The president did nothing to elevate the discussion, remarking with assurancethat in Africa “man’s emotions still have control over his intelligence.” Onother occasions, Eisenhower expressed resentment when he had to invite “thoseniggers”—by which he meant African dignitaries—to diplomatic receptions.But by spring 1959, the Eisenhower-Dulles regime was coming to an end. Fosterwas rapidly declining, as the colon cancer he had been fighting since 1956spread throughout his body. On April 11, Allen, who was vacationing at theWrightsmans’ in Palm Beach at the time, was summoned by his brother to thenearby Hobe Sound estate of State Department undersecretary C. Douglas Dillon,where Foster was resting between hospital visits. Allen found a gaunt-lookingFoster in bed, writing a letter of resignation on one of the yellow legal padsthat he always kept close at hand. “I could see that my brother was in greatpain,” Allen later remembered. “He told me that he felt the time had come forhim to resign, and he wanted me to go to see the president and persuade thepresident to accept his resignation.”Allen chartered a plane and flew to Augusta, Georgia, where Eisenhower wasstaying in his “little White House” on the carpeted greenery of the famed golfcourse. At first, the president refused to accept Foster’s resignation—a gestureof respect for the secretary of state’s centrality in the administration thatAllen would always appreciate. But Foster, whose resignation was effective April22, was soon forced to return to Walter Reed Hospital in Washington, where hedied just after dawn on May 24, 1959, at age seventy-one.Foster’s implacable Cold War philosophy remained stiffly intact to the very end,as he brushed aside narcotic painkillers and went stoically to his death. Theone burst of passion in his businesslike resignation letter came when hereminded Eisenhower of their long struggle against the “formidable and ruthlesschallenge from international Communism,” an evil force that had made it“manifestly difficult” for their administration to “avoid the awful catastropheof war.” In his deathbed conversations with his brother and other closeadministration officials, Foster urged them to continue steering a vigilantcourse, warning them not to be bewitched by the enemy’s siren songs of peace.Nixon dutifully took notes while listening to his mentor’s parting words ofwisdom. So did Foster’s younger brother.“Foster had only days, maybe hours, to live, and he knew it,” Allen wrote.“Speech came hard as the cancer gripped him. I saw there was something veryspecial he wished to tell me. Every word of what he said was a struggle and costpain. This was his last legacy to me.”Foster’s final testament, as recorded by Allen, was a remarkable war cry,undimmed by pain or the creeping fog of death—it was a gift of forged steel froma dying knight to his loyal brother-in-arms. Remember, Foster told his youngerbrother, America was facing “no ordinary antagonist. . . . The Soviets soughtnot a place in the sun, but the sun itself. Their objective was the world.”Somehow, the American people must “be brought to understand the issues, theirresponsibilities and the need for American leadership anywhere, maybe eveneverywhere, in the world. This is what my brother said to me on that May day.This was his last message to me.”To defeat relentless Communism and to project U.S. power “everywhere in theworld”—Allen Dulles was determined to continue pursuing his brother’s holy war.But with Foster buried at Arlington National Cemetery, the younger Dulles hadlost his principal Washington ally. Allen had never been as close to Eisenhoweras Foster. The president had given his CIA director a long leash, but he neverfelt fully confident in his judgment. The relationship between the two men wouldsharply fracture in May 1960 when a high-flying U-2 spy plane operated by theCIA was shot down over the Soviet Union—sabotaging an upcoming summit meetingwith Khrushchev and ruining Eisenhower’s final chance for a Cold Warbreakthrough. Eisenhower was agonizingly aware of the political risks he wastaking by authorizing the U-2 spy missions over Soviet territory, calling hison-again, off-again approval for the surveillance flights one of the most“soul-searching questions to come before a president.” But Dulles had repeatedlyassured Eisenhower that the high-altitude spy planes were safe from Russianantiaircraft missiles.On May 1, the president found out his CIA director’s assurances were hollow,when a Soviet missile slammed into a U-2 plane flying over Russia’s UralMountains, resulting in the downing of the aircraft and the capture of CIA pilotFrancis Gary Powers. The flight on the eve of the Paris Summit seemed so badlytimed and planned that at least one close observer, Air Force colonel L.Fletcher Prouty, suspected that the CIA had intentionally provoked the incidentin order to ruin the peace conference and ensure the continued reign of Dullesdogmatism. Prouty, a liaison officer between the Pentagon and the CIA who wassummoned by Dulles whenever CIA spy flights ran into trouble, later wrote thatthe U-2 shootdown was “a most unusual event” that grew out of a “tremendousunderground struggle [between] the peacemakers led by President Eisenhower” andthe Dulles “inner elite.”John Eisenhower, who was generally reluctant to give his father advice, was sodisturbed by the deceitful way that Dulles handled the U-2 affair that he urgedIke to fire him. The president erupted at his son, “yelling at the top of hisvoice for me to drop dead.” But the younger Eisenhower sensed that his father’srage came from the realization that he should have fired Dulles long before. Thepresident told White House aides Andrew Goodpaster and Gordon Gray that he neverwanted to set eyes on Dulles again.In the final days of his presidency, Eisenhower was presented with yet anotherset of recommendations for getting Allen Dulles’s CIA under control, this timeby the President’s Board of Consultants on Foreign Intelligence Activities,which urged the spy agency to de-emphasize the cloak-and-dagger adventures ofwhich Dulles was so fond in favor of intelligence gathering and analysis. But itwas far too late for Eisenhower to do anything about his spymaster and theparallel government that he seemed to run. “I’ve tried,” Ike told Gray. “Icannot change Allen Dulles.”At a meeting of national security advisers convened in the White House toconsider the panel’s reform proposals, Dulles brushed aside any suggestion thathis management of the CIA was flawed. It would be folly for him to delegate anyresponsibility for running the agency, he insisted. Without his leadership, thecountry’s intelligence apparatus would be “a body floating in thin air.”Dulles’s display of arrogance at last triggered an explosive reaction fromEisenhower. He had delegated far too much of his presidency to the Dullesbrothers, and he suspected that history would not be kind to him. In a scoldingtone, the president told Dulles that the CIA was badly organized and badlyrun—and as commander in chief, he had been utterly powerless to do anythingabout it, despite one blue-ribbon presidential task force after the next. Hewould leave the next president a “legacy of ashes,” Eisenhower bitterlyremarked.Dulles had little reason to take Eisenhower’s words to heart. He had alreadyensured his continued reign in the incoming Kennedy administration.As the 1960 presidential election approached its climax, JFK’s criticisms ofEisenhower-Dulles foreign policy grew sharper, focusing on the Republicanadministration’s irresponsible record of nuclear brinksmanship as well as itsdisquieting ignorance of international affairs. (Foster, who had little interestin the world beyond the central poles of power, once mixed up Tunisia andIndonesia, and his State Department staff had a difficult time distinguishingbetween Niger and Nigeria.) But Allen Dulles did not let Kennedy’s often cuttingcampaign rhetoric disrupt their relationship. Dulles knew that the race betweenKennedy and Nixon would be close. He was confident of his continued command ofthe CIA if the Republican candidate, a longtime disciple of the Dulles brothers,won the November election. But Dulles realized that if his job were to survive aDemocratic presidential victory, Kennedy would require more charm and effort onhis part.During JFK’s run for the White House, Dulles received inside reports on theKennedy camp from a number of mutual friends, including Charlie Wrightsman andMary Bancroft. Wrightsman, whose Kennedy ties seemed to trump his Republicanvalues, reported to Dulles on the growing confidence within the Kennedy familycircle as the election neared. Meanwhile, Dulles’s former mistress, who met Johnand Robert Kennedy through her Democratic Party activism in New York Citypolitics, became increasingly smitten with JFK. In July 1959, Bancroft wroteKennedy a gushing letter after meeting him at a New York political gathering,vowing that she would support his ambitions “all of the way—and not just for’60—but forever.”Dulles and Kennedy engaged in a careful minuet during the 1960 campaign. Bothmen knew they belonged to different political worlds, but there was some socialoverlap between their circles, and neither man saw any reason to antagonize theother. Kennedy knew that Dulles ruled a powerful empire that could help or hurthis campaign, and he made an effort to stay in the spymaster’s good graces,going as far as to add his late brother’s name to the “honorable roster” ofpolitical heroes Kennedy wrote about in Profiles in Courage.It was Jackie Kennedy who tipped off Dulles to the pleasures of James Bond,giving him a copy of From Russia with Love, which became one of his favorite spynovels. After he got hooked on Ian Fleming, the CIA director would send copiesof new Bond novels to the senator and his wife as soon as he got his hands onthem.In typical fashion, Dulles played both sides of the 1960 presidential campaign,currying favor with Kennedy as well as Nixon. On July 23, the CIA director metwith the Democratic candidate at the Kennedy family compound in Hyannis Port togive him an intelligence briefing. After the election, Nixon charged that Dulleshad given his opponent an unfair advantage at this meeting by briefing JFK aboutthe CIA’s plans for a paramilitary invasion of Cuba. In his memoir, Six Crises,Nixon accused Kennedy of using this inside information to straitjacket him onthe Cuba issue. When JFK demanded militant action on Cuba on the eve of thefinal presidential debate, Nixon—who could not reveal that the administrationwas indeed secretly planning such a course—was forced to take a cautionaryposture, chiding Kennedy for his “dangerously irresponsible recommendations.”Dulles later strongly denied Nixon’s accusation, insisting that he did not briefKennedy about the Bay of Pigs operation until after the election. But his denialhad a slippery feel to it. “Nixon indicated he thought he’d beendouble-crossed,” Dulles told former CIA colleague Tom Braden in 1964. “I saidthis is all a misunderstanding because as far as I know President Kennedy didnot know about the training—from me anyway [italics added]. . . . He didn’t knowanything about it from me, until after the election took place.” Dulles did notspell out whether any other CIA official might have tipped off Kennedy on theCIA chief’s authorization.If Dulles used his Kennedy briefings to win points with the Democratic nominee,he also used these private sessions to gain inside information for the Nixoncamp. On a Saturday evening in September 1960, Robert Kennedy—his brother’snotoriously aggressive campaign manager—phoned Dulles at home, interrupting adinner he was hosting, to inform the CIA director that Jack wanted anotherintelligence briefing on Monday morning at his Georgetown home. It was the kindof brusque request that CIA officials would grow used to receiving from Bobby,who was not known for his patience or ingratiating manners when his brother’spressing needs were at stake. Dulles was not used to being summoned in soperemptory a fashion, particularly by political operatives like Bobby Kennedy,who was more than three decades his junior. But, still eager to please theKennedys, he showed up at JFK’s town house at the appointed hour.When the presidential candidate, who was meeting with Senator Albert Gore Sr. ofTennessee at the time, kept the CIA director waiting, Dulles did notcomplain—and he even graciously allowed another waiting guest, a minor MiddleEastern prince, to see Kennedy before him. But after Dulles’s half-hour meetingwith the Democratic nominee, the spymaster promptly sent a memo about theirconversation to Andy Goodpaster in the White House, knowing that Eisenhower’sstaff would certainly relay it to the Nixon campaign.The September 21 Dulles memo focused on the U-2 controversy, of which Kennedyhad already made a campaign issue. The CIA director, who was acutely aware ofhis responsibility for the crisis and how it was being exploited by theDemocrats, informed Goodpaster that JFK asked him for his reaction to Countdownfor Decision, a new book by retired Army general J. B. Medaris that was sharplycritical of the Eisenhower administration’s handling of the U-2 affair. “As Imentioned to you,” Dulles wrote the White House aide in a follow-up memo a fewdays later, “I have reason to believe that this book will be cited in thecampaign in view of certain statements which were made to me by Senator Kennedywhen I briefed him last Monday.”Despite Dulles’s efforts to help the vice president by informing on the Kennedycampaign, Nixon continued to hold a grudge about the CIA chief’s duplicity.Until the end of his Washington career, Nixon would harbor suspicions about theCIA and its political treachery. Nixon, who had carried water for the Dullesbrothers ever since the Alger Hiss affair, had expected the spymaster’suncompromising support in his run for the White House. But Dulles was notconcerned with personal or political loyalties. By playing both sides of theclosely contested 1960 race, Dulles ensured that he would be the victor, nomatter who won.On Wednesday evening, November 9, the day after JFK’s breathtakingly closevictory, the president-elect and several members of his inner circle sippedcocktails in the living room at Hyannis Port, recovering from their all-nightordeal and savoring the hard-won moment. At one point, the group of insidersbegan discussing what Kennedy should do first as president. The group was keenlyaware of the historical turning point and of the unique opportunities open toJFK with his generational changing of the guard. The first thing he should do,suggested one insider, is fire J. Edgar Hoover. While he was at it, saidanother, Kennedy should get rid of Allen Dulles. Both men were symbols of areactionary past—and there was something sinister about their interminablereigns. A relaxed Kennedy encouraged the free-flowing conversation, and theguests retired to their rooms at the compound that night under the impressionthat the new president was in step with their recommendations. But the nextmorning, they were unpleasantly surprised to read in the daily papers thatKennedy had already announced that he was retaining both Hoover and Dulles.Kennedy later explained to Arthur Schlesinger that, considering his slim marginof victory, he didn’t feel that he had sufficient political capital to uproottwo Washington pillars like Hoover and Dulles. Jettisoning these “nationalicons,” as Schlesinger described them, would have provoked a sharp backlash fromthe influential network of allies that they had accumulated in the Washingtonbureaucracy and among the Georgetown and Manhattan chattering classes.Schlesinger, ever eager to put Kennedy’s actions in the best possible light,later called JFK’s decision to include prominent Republicans in hisadministration—such as Dulles and C. Douglas Dillon, who was appointed Treasurychief—part of the youthful president-elect’s “strategy of reassurance.” TheHarvard historian played a unique role in Kennedy’s life: special assistant tothe president, political adviser, court chronicler, and liaison to the liberaland intellectual circles with which JFK had a complicated and often pricklyrelationship. “Here’s Arthur,” JFK wryly remarked one evening, as his adviserjoined a casual staff gathering in the Oval Office. “He used to be a liberal.Maybe he can explain why they do these crazy things.” The bow-tied, bespectacledscholar seemed an unlikely member of the New Frontier inner circle, wherehandsome men of action—the kind who could throw a long, tight spiral and skippera sailboat—dominated. But Kennedy had a respectful if sometimes teasingrelationship with Schlesinger, often using him as a sounding board for new ideasand appointments that he was considering, as well as a voice of conscience.When Schlesinger communicated to Kennedy liberals’ growing concerns about hispolitical appointments, the president told him he understood, “but theyshouldn’t worry. What matters is the program.” JFK assured his adviser that hispolicies would be solidly liberal, no matter who held positions in hisadministration. Besides, said Kennedy, he had given men like Dulles only atemporary reprieve—they would be gone soon enough. “We’ll have to go with thisfor a year or so. Then I would like to bring in some new people.” But Kennedywas not naïve about the workings of Washington power. After a thoughtful pause,he added, “I suppose it may be hard to get rid of these people once they arein.”Kennedy already knew the man he wanted to replace Dulles—tall, brainy Richard M.Bissell Jr., the Groton- and Yale-educated chief of clandestine operations forthe CIA. Bissell, a popular member of the Georgetown set, had managed to survivethe political fallout from the U-2 disaster, even though he was in charge of thespy-in-the-sky program. With his impressive academic credentials, which includeda degree from the London School of Economics, and his grasp of the latestsurveillance technology, Bissell struck JFK as a man of the future.In February, soon after Kennedy’s inauguration, Dulles organized awell-lubricated mixer for his top CIA men and Kennedy’s White House team at theAlibi Club, his favorite Washington watering hole. The venerable gentlemen’sclub—located in an old brick town house that had changed little since the daysof its founding, in the muttonchop era of President Chester A. Arthur—catered toan exclusive membership list, including Supreme Court justices, Joint Chiefschairmen, and former presidents. After breaking the ice with “a pleasantthree-cocktail dinner,” as one guest described it, the CIA men got up, one at atime, to explain their mysterious roles to the White House aides. Dulles himselfwas used to dominating these occasions. But on this evening, it was Bissell whotook the spotlight. Dulles’s deputy introduced himself by saying, “I’m yourbasic man-eating shark,” an opening “with just the right mix of bravado andself-mockery to charm the New Frontiersmen,” as historian Evan Thomas observed.The president made no secret of his plan to shake up the CIA and to replaceDulles with his number two man. Kennedy’s father had served on the foreignintelligence advisory board that had urged Eisenhower to overhaul the managementof the spy agency. Joseph P. Kennedy had made his son fully aware of Dulles’sdangerously unsupervised management style. After the November election, a memberof Kennedy’s transition team, aware of his low opinion of the CIA’s leadership,asked him, “There must be someone you really trust within the intelligencecommunity. Who is that?” Kennedy could think of only one man. “Richard Bissell,”he answered.But Allen Dulles had no intention of relinquishing power anytime soon, not evento one of his right-hand men like Bissell. To Dulles, the Kennedy transition wasjust one more seasonal Washington cycle that had to be finessed. In the daysleading up to Kennedy’s inauguration, the press was filled with stories aboutall the fresh new faces in Washington. But many of the Kennedy appointments hadcloser ties to the Dulles old guard than they did to the new president.Among them was McGeorge Bundy, the owlish Harvard dean whom Kennedy appointednational security adviser. The long ties between Dulles and the Boston BrahminBundy family had been fortified when the CIA director rescued Mac Bundy’sbrother, CIA officer Bill Bundy, from Joe McCarthy’s pyre. Mac Bundy regardedDulles as a benevolent uncle, maintaining a warm correspondence with him thatlasted until the end of the elder man’s life. When Bundy became dean ofHarvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences in 1953—at age thirty-four, the youngestin the school’s history—he used his post to identify future prospects for theCIA among the student body’s best and brightest. Dulles could be assured thatwith Mac Bundy in the White House—and with his brother Bill moving to Kennedy’sDefense Department, where the press dubbed him “the Pentagon’s secretary ofstate”—the CIA director had eyes and ears in two of the most important commandposts in the Kennedy administration.Kennedy’s New Frontier was laced throughout with other Dulles loyalists,especially in the foreign service and national security agencies. General LymanLemnitzer, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff whom Kennedy inherited fromEisenhower, had a long partnership with Dulles, going back to their wartimeintrigues in Operation Sunrise. Kennedy’s choice for secretary of state, DeanRusk, was well known to the Dulles brothers from their membership in the Councilon Foreign Relations and the Rockefeller Foundation, where Rusk served aspresident and Foster as a trustee. Rusk’s State Department continued to befilled with Dulles men and women, including Eleanor Dulles herself, who remainedat the German affairs desk. Even Jackie Kennedy’s social secretary, LetitiaBaldrige, had worked for the CIA in the early 1950s, specializing inpsychological warfare. The “doyenne of decorum” had also served as an assistantto Dulles’s close ally, Ambassador Clare Booth Luce, in the U.S. embassy inRome.Dulles was confident enough that the Dulles era would continue under JFK that hemade boasts to that effect on the Washington dinner party circuit, within fullearshot of Kennedy loyalists. Shortly after Kennedy took office, the painterWilliam Walton, a close friend of JFK and Jackie, found himself at a gatheringat Walter Lippmann’s house where Dulles was a fellow guest. “After dinner, themen sat around awhile in an old-fashioned way, and [Dulles] started boastingthat he was still carrying out his brother Foster’s foreign policy. He said, youknow, that’s a much better policy. I’ve chosen to follow that one.” Walton, wholoathed the CIA boss, couldn’t believe Dulles’s audacity. The spymaster knewthat Walton was one of Kennedy’s inner circle, but he felt no need to hold histongue. Dulles was clearly sending the new president a message—and Kennedy’sclose friend duly delivered it. Early the next morning, Walton phoned JFK at theWhite House and reported what Dulles had told Lippmann and his guests. “God damnit!” swore Kennedy. “Did he really say that?”“The torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans,” Kennedy declaredin his inaugural address. But, in fact, the Dulles old guard was deeplyreluctant to give up power to the New Frontier team. In fact, the power strugglebetween the new president and his CIA director started before Kennedy was evensworn in, when Dulles took advantage of the transition period to carry out abrazen act of insubordination.Patrice Lumumba was fleeing for his life. Sworn in less than six months earlieras the Congo’s first democratically elected leader, following the end ofBelgium’s brutal colonial rule, Lumumba was now on the run from the CIA-backedCongolese military forces that had deposed him. Lumumba had broken free fromhouse arrest in the capital, Leopoldville, on the evening of November 27, 1960.He was now making his way through a tropical downpour across the countryside toStanleyville, a bastion of loyal nationalism some 750 miles to the east, wherehe hoped to raise an army and reclaim his office. Lumumba was driven in a newblue Peugeot, with his wife, Pauline Opango, and their two-year-old son, Roland,part of a three-car convoy that included other high officials from his toppledgovernment.The election of Lumumba in June 1960 had electrified the Congo, a nation thathad been enslaved and plundered by its Belgian rulers for over three-quarters ofa century. In the late nineteenth century, King Leopold II had carved an empireout of this benighted African territory through a system of forced labor sovicious that Joseph Conrad modeled the colonial nightmare in his novel Heart ofDarkness on it, calling Leopold’s rape of the Congo “the vilest scramble forloot that ever disfigured the history of human conscience.” The hands choppedfrom the arms of Congolese men who refused to work under their colonial masters’yoke became a world symbol of Belgium’s vile rule. After Leopold, the looting ofCongo continued, with rubber and ivory being replaced by gold, diamonds, copper,and tin as the objects of Western desire. Global mining companies turned themineral-rich African nation into their private jewelry box, with huge fortunesamassed in Brussels, London, and New York.But Patrice Lumumba’s election threatened this long reign of greed. Lumumba, aslender, graceful man with glasses and a trim mustache and goatee, looked morelike the postal clerk he had once been (one of the few civil service jobs opento Africans under Belgian rule) than a fiery nationalist leader. But he spokewith a heartfelt eloquence that dazzled his followers and alarmed his enemies.On June 30, the Congo’s independence was formally celebrated in the flag-drapedNational Palace in Leopoldville. King Baudouin of Belgium, a young monarch whonever fully took to his role, and would become known as “the sad king,”delivered a fatuous speech, praising his royal predecessors for bestowing the“fabric of civilization” on the primitive nation. The handsome king, who wore awhite colonial uniform and round spectacles that gave him the wide-eyed look ofsilent screen comedian Harold Lloyd, seemed oblivious to the country’s shamefulpast. It fell to Lumumba, who followed the king to the microphone, to set himstraight. The Congo’s colonial history, said the new prime minister, was “muchtoo painful to be forgotten.” Lumumba spoke passionately about his people’sstruggle against “the humiliating bondage forced upon us”—years that were“filled with tears, fire and blood.” But he ended on a hopeful note, vowing, “Weshall show the world what the black man can do when working in liberty, and weshall make the Congo the pride of Africa.”Lumumba’s ardent remarks lifted up the Congolese people, who danced in thestreets of the capital to celebrate their freedom. But King Baudouin and theother Western representatives who attended the independence ceremony wereinsulted by the prime minister’s frank remarks. Lumumba had “marred theceremonies,” sniffed the New York Times correspondent.After Lumumba’s Independence Day speech, national security officials inWashington and Brussels—who were already monitoring the rise of the charismaticCongolese leader—began regarding him as a serious threat to Western interests inthe region. More than his defiant rhetoric, it was Lumumba’s refusal to bebought off by the multinational corporations controlling the Congo’s wealth thatundoubtedly sealed his fate. In speeches to his followers, Lumumba opened a dooron the corrupt backroom dealings that continued to dominate African capitals inthe neocolonial era. The United States, he declared, was rubbing its hands overthe Congo’s uranium deposits—the same deposits that supplied the uranium for thebombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Speaking to dinner guests at apolitical event in October 1960, Lumumba said that he could have made millionsof dollars if he had been willing to “mortgage the national sovereignty.”Dulles, Doug Dillon (then serving as a State Department undersecretary), andWilliam Burden, the U.S. ambassador to Belgium, led the charge within theEisenhower administration to first demonize and then dispose of Lumumba. Allthree men had financial interests in the Congo. The Dillon family’s investmentbank handled the Congo’s bond issues. Dulles’s old law firm represented theAmerican Metal Company (later AMAX), a mining giant with holdings in the Congo,and Dulles was friendly with the company’s chairman, Harold Hochschild, and hisbrother and successor, Walter, who served in the OSS during the war. AmbassadorBurden was a company director, and Frank Taylor Ostrander Jr., a former U.S.intelligence official, served the Hochschild brothers as a political adviser.Corporate executives with major stakes in Africa were able to mingle and conferwith U.S. national security officials at prestigious organizations like theManhattan-based Africa-America Institute. The institute, which Harold Hochschildhelped launch in 1953, sponsored the American education of future generations ofAfrican leaders, a goal the CIA found strategically valuable enough to help fundthe group. Years later, after the Africa-America Institute was exposed as a CIAfront, Hochschild appeared chagrinned when the subject came up with his son,Adam. The younger Hochschild cofounded Mother Jones magazine and later authoredKing Leopold’s Ghost, a powerful indictment of the Belgian reign of terror inthe Congo. After the CIA ties to the institute were exposed, Hochschild filslater recalled, “[Father] seemed uncomfortable. He defended the link, sayingthat in its early years there was nowhere else the institute could have gottenenough money for its work. But he was clearly embarrassed that the whole thinghad to be kept secret.”The Eisenhower administration’s increasingly militant policy toward Lumumba tookshape over cocktails in clublike environments such as the Africa-AmericaInstitute and the Council on Foreign Relations. The men driving the policy hadlittle feel for the suffering or longing of the Congolese people. AmbassadorBurden was a Vanderbilt heir—a big, paunchy, high-society boozer who was stuffedfull of the imbecilities and prejudices of his caste; he was not fond of Jews,and he treated his legions of nameless servants as if they were indentured. Notparticularly bright, he represented what his granddaughter, Wendy, would latercall the “dead end gene pool.” Everything was “marvelous,” in Burden’s world. Hesaid it “the way a character in a Fitzgerald novel would,” Wendy Burden recalledin a family memoir. “Mah-velous. He said it about a hundred times a day, as ifit were the only adjective that could aptly describes the talents of a chef, orthe plate of Belon oysters before him, or the Chateau Petrus he was drinking, orhow he felt about the overthrow of the Libyan government.”Burden, who had acquired his ambassadorship by contributing heavily to the 1956Eisenhower campaign, spent his days in Brussels attending diplomatic receptions,where he soaked up the finest Champagnes along with the racial prejudices ofBelgium’s shriveling empire. It was the ambassador who first raised alarms aboutthe rising Patrice Lumumba, whom the Belgians only yesterday were calling “adirty monkey” but now were labeling “Satan.” Burden began sending agitatedcables to Dulles in Washington well before Lumumba’s election, suggesting thatthe growing aspirations of the Congolese people were Soviet-inspired and urgingthat strong measures be used to put down African unrest. “Dear Allan [sic],”Burden wrote in a November 1959 cable, misspelling his chum’s name, “Have yourorganization and [the Department of] Defense done much work recently in studyingthe type of rioting which is occurring and might occur in the various countriesof Africa [and] the degree to which new weapons, such as some of the newergases, might enable such difficulties to be controlled?” By the followingsummer, Burden was cabling Washington “to destroy Lumumba government” as athreat to “our vital interests in Congo.”Dulles quickly embraced the idea that Lumumba was a diabolical agent ofCommunist subversion. In truth, Lumumba had less of a connection to Moscow thanany other emerging African leader. He explicitly tried to keep his strugglingnation out of the superpower vortex, vowing that the Congo would “never be asatellite of Russia or of the United States.”“We want no part of the Cold War,” Lumumba declared. “We want Africa to remainAfrican with a policy of neutralism.” But in the Dulles worldview, there was nosuch thing as neutrality. And anyone who professed such notions belonged to theenemy camp. At a July 22, 1960, National Security Council meeting in theEisenhower White House—just three weeks after Lumumba’s independence dayspeech—Dulles denounced the Congolese leader as “a Castro or worse. . . . It issafe to go on the assumption that Lumumba has been bought by the Communists.”Doug Dillon strongly backed Dulles’s distraught view of Lumumba as a Sovietaccomplice. It was an alarmist view calculated to convince Eisenhower that theAfrican leader had to be terminated. As it turned out, the president requiredlittle persuasion. By the summer of 1960, Ike was sick, tired, and cranky—and hehad little patience or understanding for Third World freedom struggles.Conferring with the British foreign minister Lord Home, Eisenhower quipped thathe hoped “Lumumba would fall into a river full of crocodiles.” At an NSC meetingin August 1960, Eisenhower gave Dulles direct approval to “eliminate” Lumumba.Robert Johnson, the minutes taker at the NSC meeting, later recalled the shockfelt in the room: “There was a stunned silence for about 15 seconds and themeeting continued.” Johnson said there was nothing ambiguous about Eisenhower’slethal order. “I was surprised that I would ever hear a president say anythinglike this in my presence or the presence of a group of people. I was startled.”Over the next several months, the CIA, working with its allies in Belgianintelligence, engineered a military coup led by a cocky, ruthless,twenty-nine-year-old colonel named Joseph Mobutu that forced Lumumba out ofoffice and placed him under house arrest. But that was not enough for the CIA.Lumumba “would remain a grave danger,” Dulles told an NSC meeting on September21, 1960, “as long as he was not yet disposed of.” Three days later, Dulles madeit clear that he wanted Lumumba permanently removed, cabling the CIA’sLeopoldville station, “We wish give [sic] every possible support in eliminatingLumumba from any possibility resuming governmental position.”Washington ascribed a kind of witchcraft-like power to Lumumba. Dulles marveledat the man’s political survival skills, and Dillon was amazed at his powers ofpersuasion. “He had this tremendous ability to stir up a crowd or a group,” saidDillon. “And if he could have gotten out and started to talk to a battalion ofthe Congolese Army, he probably would have had them in the palm of his hand infive minutes.”To prevent that from happening, the CIA recruited two cutthroats from theEuropean criminal underworld, whom they code-named QJ-WIN and WI-ROGUE. TheseTweedledum and Tweedledee assassins were such loathsome mercenaries that eventheir CIA handlers found them “unsavory.” ROGUE was the kind of morally unhingedman “who would try anything once, at least,” said his agency supervisors,untroubled by the “pangs of conscience.” While ROGUE went about trying toorganize an “execution squad” to kill Lumumba, WIN focused on penetrating theprotective ring of UN troops that encircled the house where the Congolese leaderwas in custody. QJ-WIN had been supplied with a tube of poison toothpaste, whichhad been delivered to the CIA station in Leopoldville by Sidney Gottlieb, theagency’s wizard of toxins. Dr. Ewen Cameron, of the notorious Allan Institute,had analyzed Lumumba at the CIA’s request and determined that he must brush histeeth regularly, since they looked gleaming white in photos. Therefore, Ewenassured Dulles, chemically altered dental products were the key to getting ridof Lumumba.In the end, the CIA did not go through with the toothpaste plot, apparentlydeciding that poisoning a popular leader while he was under UN protectivecustody in his own house would be too flagrant a deed—one that, if traced backto the agency, would lead to unpleasant international repercussions. It would bewiser, the agency decided, to deliver Lumumba to his murderous political rivalsin the Congo and let them do the job. And so Lumumba fled house arrest—or wasallowed to escape—miraculously slipping past not only the UN troops that wereguarding him but Mobutu’s hostile forces, and making his dash for Stanleyville.As Lumumba’s convoy made its way along muddy and bumpy roads, he was pursued byCongolese troops, led by Captain Gilbert Pongo, Mobutu’s notorious securitychief. Pongo buzzed after Lumumba’s party in a helicopter that had been providedcourtesy of Clare Timberlake, the dapper, mustachioed U.S. ambassador who workedclosely with the CIA delegation in the Congo. Lumumba’s flight was slowedwhenever his convoy drove through villages, where he was thronged by the localpeople and urged to deliver speeches. When he spoke, he gave voice to theirdreams. “Our program is clear: complete independence, Congo for the Congolese,”he told a group huddled around a fire one night. “Fourteen million Congolesewant work, a better future for their children. They want to be citizens withfull political rights, they want a new life.”When Lumumba’s military pursuers drew too near, villagers delayed their advanceby putting up roadblocks and tearing down bridges. On the evening of December 1,Lumumba’s group reached the small village of Lodi, on the west bank of theSankuru River. This wide, muddy stretch of the river was the last seriousobstacle that lay between the group and sanctuary in Stanleyville. The otherside of the river was a bastion of pro-Lumumba nationalism. There was only onecanoe on the riverbank. Lumumba and a few of his top aides crossed first. Asthey disembarked from the dugout, they heard a commotion on the other side ofthe river. Mobutu’s soldiers had caught up with the group left behind, includingLumumba’s wife and toddler.Lumumba’s compatriots begged him not to return across the river, telling him“the life of the whole nation is at stake.” But he could not stand to hear thecries of his wife. “When one struggles for one’s country,” he said as he gotback into the canoe, “one has to expect a tragic end.” As Lumumba’s canoe glidedback to the other side of the river, the soldiers waded into the water andgrabbed him. Lumumba tried winning over Mobutu’s men. For a while, his wordsseemed to work their magic—the soldiers were ready to join the cause of freedomand march with him to Stanleyville. But then Captain Pongo intervened, remindinghis soldiers of the dire consequences that would befall them and their familiesif they did not do their duty. They turned in an instant and began beatingLumumba and even his little son.Lumumba was hustled onto Pongo’s helicopter and flown back to Leopoldville,where he emerged in the glare of TV news cameras, only to be subjected toanother vicious round of beating by Mobutu’s thugs, while the cameras rolled.Throughout it all, Lumumba maintained the serene dignity of the martyr that hesoon would become. “On Lumumba’s dazed face was the look of a man who did notyet believe that fate could be against justice for his people,” remarked AndréeBlouin, the beautiful “Black Pasionaria” of the Congolese independence struggleand chief of protocol in Lumumba’s government. “His white shirt was now spottedwith blood, but his head was still erect. He personified the best of the racethat would never again be slaves.”Over the next several weeks, Lumumba’s fate became the focus of a tumultuousinternational drama, as the symbol of African freedom languished in a militaryprison south of Leopoldville. World leaders—including Khrushchev, Nasser, andGhana’s Kwame Nkrumah—issued fervent pleas for his release, with the Sovietleader promising that the “colonialists will be thrown out of the Congo once andfor all.” Lumumba’s followers prayed that he could survive until theinauguration of Kennedy, whose election the Congolese leader had praised.But in Leopoldville, U.S. and Belgian agents were feverishly maneuvering toensure that no such release took place. The man at the center of this intriguewas Lawrence R. Devlin, the CIA station chief in the Congo, a Harvard man whohad been handpicked for the spy service by his dean, Mac Bundy. Larry Devlin’saggressive campaign against Lumumba had won him the admiration of the agency’stop command, including Dulles himself. At the end of November, when Mobutu’stroops were in pursuit of Lumumba, Devlin had flown to Rome to meet with DickBissell, whom Dulles had put in charge of the Lumumba assassination. The CIA wasstill determined to carry out Eisenhower’s termination order. But Devlin and hisCIA superiors knew that time was running short.U.S. intelligence officials continued to fret about the Congo situation, evenafter Lumumba’s capture. With Mobutu’s rule still shaky and Congolese politicsin chaos, Devlin realized that Lumumba’s imprisonment could not be ensuredindefinitely. In fact, by the second week of January 1961, when Lumumba’sjailers briefly mutinied and threatened to free him, his captivity seemed lesssecure than ever.Meanwhile, Dulles and his Congo team were acutely aware that the presidentialtransition under way in Washington also put their Lumumba operation in jeopardy.Kennedy, whose inauguration was scheduled for January 20, had already signaledthat he would shift U.S. policy in favor of African nationalists like Lumumba.In late December, after returning from a five-week tour of the Congo and otherAfrican countries, a Democratic fact-finding delegation that included JFK’sbrother Edward M. Kennedy predicted that the new administration would alignitself with the continent’s “movement for freedom and self-determination” andexpressed strong sympathy for Lumumba’s plight. Ted Kennedy later went further,calling for the release of Lumumba and suggesting his brother agreed with thisposition.The raging battle over Lumumba’s future broke into the U.S. press, with theCIA’s media assets predicting drastic consequences if the Congolese leaderreturned to power. As the Congo crisis reached its climax, a new correspondentfor The New York Times showed up in Leopoldville with a distinctly anti-Lumumbabias. Paul Hofmann was a diminutive, sophisticated Austrian with a colorfulpast. During the war, he served in Rome as a top aide to the notorious Nazigeneral Kurt Malzer, who was later convicted of the mass murder of Italianpartisans. At some point, Hofmann became an informer for the Allies, and afterthe war he became closely associated with Jim Angleton. The Angleton familyhelped place Hofmann in the Rome bureau of The New York Times, where hecontinued to be of use to his friends in U.S. intelligence, translating reportsfrom confidential sources inside the Vatican and passing them along to Angleton.Hofmann became one of the Times’s leading foreign correspondents, eventuallytaking over the newspaper’s Rome bureau and parachuting from time to time intointernational hot spots like the Congo.The New York Times coverage of the Congo crisis had always been slanted againstLumumba, with columns and commentaries labeling him “inexperienced andirresponsible” and a “virtual dictator.” But Hofmann’s Congo coverage was sovirulent in its bias that it seemed as if he were acting as a “psywar” conduitfor U.S. intelligence. In article after article, during the critical Congo endgame, Hofmann portrayed Lumumba as a dangerous bogeyman, a “wily” conspirator insome pieces and a mentally unbalanced buffoon in others (“the weirdest characterin a sort of Alice in Tropical Wonderland,” as the Times man wrote). Even behindbars, Lumumba continued to work his dark mischief, Hofmann told his readers,plotting the murders of whites and bringing a flow of Soviet arms into thecountry, all while living the life of luxury in military prison “with threehouseboys at his service.” The message behind Hofmann’s relentless barrage wasclear: despite the “crocodile tears” cried by the Soviet Union over Lumumba’splight, no man as treacherous as this deserved mercy.In its explosive 1975 report on CIA assassination plots against foreign leaders,the Church Committee absolved the agency of responsibility for Lumumba’s murder.“It does not appear from the evidence that the United States was in any wayinvolved in the killing,” concluded the Senate panel. This became a convenientmyth, one that is still routinely repeated in the press. But the truth is farless comforting.As a new wave of historical research has determined, the CIA ensured Lumumba’sviolent end by making certain that he was delivered into the hands of his mortalenemies. Among his tormentors in the final hours of his life were CIA-fundedgoons. Devlin, the CIA’s man in the Congo, later tried to portray himself as ablissfully ignorant player in the Lumumba affair, and indeed as a man who foundassassination morally repugnant. But as former congressional aide and scholarStephen Weissman has observed, “The CIA was not the innocent bystander, and itsCongo operatives not the paragons of morally sensitive professionalism theyclaimed to be. In particular, Devlin was a key participant in the Congogovernment’s decision to approve Lumumba’s fatal rendition.”In fact, Devlin appears to have been more a driver of the action leading toLumumba’s death than a participant. On January 17, 1961—three days beforeKennedy’s inauguration—Lumumba was taken from his jail cell and hustled onto aBelgian chartered plane. Congolese authorities took this action under strongpressure from Devlin, who was the kingmaker behind the Mobutu regime. WithDevlin’s full knowledge, Lumumba was then flown to Katanga, a mineral-richprovince that had broken away from the Congo and was run by violent enemies ofLumumba. The CIA station chief later acknowledged that Lumumba’s transfer toKatanga amounted to a death sentence. “I think there was a general assumption,once we learned that he had been sent to Katanga, that his goose was cooked,”Devlin told the Church Committee years later.Devlin knew of Lumumba’s imminent transfer by January 14, three days ahead oftime. But he did nothing to inform Washington until January 17, when Lumumba wasalready well on the way to his doom. Devlin knew that cabling Washington riskedtipping off Africa policy makers in the incoming Kennedy administration, wholikely would have intervened to save Lumumba. By keeping quiet, Devlin sealedLumumba’s fate.Larry Devlin was no rogue agent—he was an up-and-coming intelligence officerwhose Congo exploits had won glowing marks back at CIA headquarters. The Congostation chief’s decision to keep Lumumba’s fate quiet until it was too late todo anything about it was clearly made in consultation with his supervisors.Devlin suffered no agency reprimands for his actions in the Congo, and, in fact,his intelligence career continued to thrive after Lumumba’s demise. Beforeretiring from the CIA in 1974, to pursue a new career in the Congo’s lucrativediamond industry, Devlin rose to become chief of the CIA’s Africa Division.Patrice Lumumba suffered a terrible martyrdom during his final hours on earth.He was beaten bloody during the flight to Katanga, and clumps of hair were tornfrom his head. When the plane landed, he was seized by armed guards sent byMoise Tshombe, Katanga’s ruler, and subjected to another round of abuse. As hesuffered the rain of blows, Lumumba maintained a resigned silence. He was thendragged to a jeep and driven to a remote farmhouse, where a group of menconnected to U.S. and Belgian intelligence beat him to death, an orgy of sadismthat stretched over several hours. According to one account, even Tshombe andhis ministers appeared at one point to contribute to Lumumba’s suffering,kicking and hitting what remained of his nearly lifeless body.Despite the agency’s evasions, CIA officer John Stockwell, who was stationed inthe Congo in the tumultuous aftermath of the Lumumba assassination, had no doubtwho was responsible for the African leader’s death. “Eventually he was killed,not by our poisons, but beaten to death, apparently by men who had agencycryptonyms and received agency salaries,” Stockwell concluded. Years afterLumumba’s death, Stockwell fell into conversation with one of his more peculiarCIA colleagues, a “glisteningly bald” man whom Stockwell anointed “Goldfinger.”The man regaled Stockwell with a story of the evening when he had driven aroundthe capital of Katanga, with Lumumba’s battered corpse in the trunk, “trying todecide what to do with it.”After Kennedy’s inauguration, the CIA continued to keep Lumumba’s death underwraps. On January 26, Dulles briefed the new president on the Congo. The CIAdirector said nothing about Lumumba’s assassination, though his fate was wellknown by then within the agency. In early February, Devlin and AmbassadorTimberlake were called back to Washington to participate in discussions aboutCongo policy with the new Kennedy team. The old Congo hands were alarmed by theadministration’s new position paper, which envisioned disarming Mobutu andfreeing Lumumba. Devlin considered JFK’s admiration for rising Africannationalism naïve. Timberlake, meeting with Kennedy in the White House, arguedthat the Congolese people were too primitive for a functioning democracy.Neither Timberlake nor Devlin took the opportunity to inform Kennedy or hisstaff that any discussion about Lumumba’s future was a moot point.The Kennedy White House remained in the dark about Lumumba for a full monthafter his murder. When JFK finally heard of the leader’s death, the news camenot from Dulles but from UN ambassador Adlai Stevenson.Jacques Lowe, the young photographer who had been unobtrusively documenting theKennedy story from the earliest days of his presidential run, was in the OvalOffice when JFK received the phone call from Stevenson. Lowe, a German Jew whohad survived the war as a child by making himself unseen, deftly insertedhimself into the ongoing Kennedy family drama, taking black-and-white picturesof John and Robert and their clan that would become iconic in their simpleintimacy. After JFK’s victory, the president-elect asked Lowe to “stick aroundand record my administration. Don’t worry,” he added, “I’ll make it worth yourwhile.”Kennedy made good on his promise. The photos Lowe was allowed to take during theintense rush of JFK’s brief presidency were windows into its troubled soul. Nonewas more powerful than the picture that the young photographer snapped at themoment when Kennedy was told of Lumumba’s fate. The photo is one of the mostsearing documents of the Kennedy presidency. In the close-up shot, JFK looksphysically stricken as he absorbs the news on the phone, with his eyes squeezedshut and his hand clasped to his face. It was an image of such anguish that itseemed to come from some harrowing time deep in his presidency instead of in itsearliest bloom. The picture contains all of the sorrows that were to come.Lowe later recalled the moment: “I was alone with the president; his hand wentto his head in utter despair. ‘Oh, no,’ I heard him groan . . . [Lumumba] wasconsidered a trouble-maker and a leftist by many Americans. But Kennedy’sattitude toward black Africa was that many who were considered leftists were infact nationalists and patriots. . . . He felt that Africa presented anopportunity for the West, and speaking as an American, unhindered by a colonialheritage, he had made friends in Africa. . . . The call therefore left himheartbroken, for he knew that the murder would be a prelude to chaos . . . itwas a poignant moment.”When the killing of Lumumba was finally announced, furious street protests sweptthe world, from New Delhi to Warsaw to Tokyo. Lumumba’s fellow leaders in theThird World—including Egypt’s Nasser and Nkrumah of Ghana, who had been amentor—were particularly outraged by his murder, lashing out at the West and atthe UN for failing to protect him. Brazilian delegates to the UN expressed“horror and repulsion” over Lumumba’s slaying. But, as much of the worldmourned, the Western press continued its snide coverage of Lumumba, exhuming themartyred leader only to subject him to more abuse. Time magazine snickered atthe traditional way his widow, Pauline, chose to mourn her husband, marchingbare-breasted through the streets of Leopoldville in a funeral procession.Meanwhile, The New York Times continued to demean Lumumba, sometimes resortingto the most shopworn neocolonial stereotypes of the era. “Lumumba . . . combinedthe skills of the late Senator McCarthy with the brashness of a ward heeler andthe magic touch of an African witch doctor,” wrote Henry Tanner in The New YorkTimes Magazine. “Then there was [his] name—musical, easily pronounced in alllanguages and yet exotic, African-sounding like the drums in the jungle.”After her husband’s funeral procession, Pauline Lumumba crumpled to the floor inthe dark corner of a friend’s house, too spent to cry anymore. She raised herarms in the air and let them hang there, as if in surrender. Her husband’smurderers did not even have the decency to give her his body, Pauline’s brothertold reporters. As little Roland Lumumba hovered anxiously over his mother, theroom was filled with the wails of women: “Our strong leader is gone—our greatfather is no more.”In his final letter to his wife, Patrice Lumumba vowed, “Neither brutality, norcruelty nor torture will ever bring me to ask for mercy, for I prefer to diewith my head unbowed.” It was an oath that Lumumba had kept throughout hisordeal. Lumumba also told his wife, “History will one day have its say, but itwill not be the history that is taught in Brussels, Paris, Washington or in theUnited Nations. . . . Africa will write its own history, and to the north andsouth of the Sahara, it will be a glorious and dignified history.”This promise did not come true for the Congo. The mourners at Lumumba’s wakeknew how profound a loss it was, and what it meant for their nation. “There isnothing for us to do now,” muttered Lumumba’s brother-in-law. “He is gone. Thereis no one to take his place.”With one of Africa’s brightest lights extinguished, the Congo slid into anendless nightmare of tyranny and corruption. Propped up by the United States,Mobutu began a thirty-two-year dictatorship that looted the country of itswealth and left the nation in ruins. In his rampant thievery, Mobutu modeledhimself on King Leopold. So smug was the dictator in his ironfisted rule that hedeclared Lumumba a national hero, a sick joke that only he could afford toenjoy.The CIA officials responsible for Lumumba’s murder also had a change of heartabout the man who had once haunted their days. In 1962, shortly after Dulles’sdeparture from the CIA, he remarked, “I think we overrated the Soviet danger,let’s say, in the Congo.” And Devlin, for his part, insisted he had neverthought Lumumba’s assassination was essential to U.S. security: “I didn’t regardLumumba as the kind of person who was going to bring on World War III,” he latertold the Church Committee. These expressions of remorse—if they can be calledthat—came far too late for the man who was the hope of the Congo."},{"pageContent":"PART III [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-35]"},{"pageContent":"15 [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-36]CONTEMPT [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-36]On Monday April 17, 1961, as over fourteen hundred CIA-trained anti-Castroexiles waded ashore at Cuba’s Bay of Pigs—an operation that would quickly becomethe biggest debacle of Allen Dulles’s career—the CIA director was sunninghimself about a thousand miles away at a Puerto Rico resort. Dulles, who hadflown down to San Juan that weekend, was the featured speaker at a YoungPresidents’ Organization conference, a global network of chief executives underage forty that had CIA affiliations. The gathering was held at La Concha, a newoceanfront luxury hotel that epitomized the Caribbean cool of the tropicalmodernism movement. The hotel’s signature restaurant was shaped like a giantseashell, with wavy gaps to let in the sunshine and ocean breeze. Dulles spentthe weekend swimming and playing golf with the young executives.On Monday morning, when Dulles strode onstage to deliver his remarks, he lookedlike a man without a worry in the world. The CIA director’s speech—whichfollowed a panel discussion featuring Margaret Mead and Dr. Benjamin Spock onthe subject of “Are We Letting Our Children Down?”—was a plea for globe-trottingAmerican businessmen, like those gathered in the conference hall, to join theclandestine war against Communism. Afterward, there was more time to relax bythe pool. The spymaster had brought Clover with him on the trip, completing thecarefree picture. They seemed to all the world to be just another well-to-doAmerican couple enjoying a long weekend in the Caribbean sun. But by thatevening, as Dulles and his wife flew home, the Bay of Pigs operation was on theverge of collapse, and with it, the spymaster’s long, storied career.Dick Bissell, whom Dulles had put in charge of the invasion, sent one of the topmen in the Cuba task force to pick him up at the airport, thinking that the CIAdirector would want to be briefed immediately on the growing calamity. RichardDrain, chief of operations for the Bay of Pigs expedition, rolled onto therunway at Baltimore’s Friendship Airport in his well-traveled, CIA-issuedChevrolet as Dulles’s small plane taxied to a stop. The CIA chief emerged fromthe plane with his wife and a young aide, wearing a dinner jacket and therelaxed smile of a man of leisure. Drain stepped forward and offered his hand.“I’m Dick Drain. I was sent to brief you, sir.”“Oh yes, Dick, how are you?”Drain drew Dulles away from the others.“Well, how is it going?” asked Dulles.“Not very well, sir.”“Oh, is that so?” Dulles wore an oddly bemused look, as if the unfolding tragedywas too remote to affect him.Back at Quarters Eye, the CIA headquarters in downtown Washington,battle-hardened men were on the verge of hysteria. Bissell, who prided himselfon his cool performance under pressure, seemed frozen. On the brink of failure,the Cuba operation lacked the kind of muscular leadership that could rescue themen pinned down by Castro’s forces. Drain was hoping that Dulles would save theday. But he found the Old Man’s unflappability disturbing.Clover and the young aide were bundled into the Chevrolet, and Dulles and Draindrove back to Washington in the director’s Cadillac. “It’s a fast-breakingsituation,” Drain told him. “We’re hanging on by our fingernails.”Dulles puffed quietly on his pipe as his deputy steered the car onto the highwayheading to the capital.“Today’s air strike was killed,” Drain told him—a stunning piece of news, sinceDulles knew that the operation was damned unless President Kennedy agreed toescalate the action and provide the embattled anti-Castro brigade with U.S. aircover.“Why did they do that?” Dulles asked softly. There was no anger or outrage inhis voice.The emotion all belonged to Drain. “If you’re asking my guess, my guess is thisthing is all going to hell.”By the disastrous end of the operation, when Castro’s forces had killed morethan a hundred of the invaders and taken the rest prisoner, Drain would be sowrung out that he vomited. Like the rest of the CIA planning team, Drain hadworked closely with the exile leaders who were trapped on the desolate stretchof sand and shrubbery, and they took the men’s fate personally. But Dulles’smind seemed elsewhere as he and Drain drove to the director’s Georgetownresidence. They rode in silence for a long time, until Drain let out a finalburst of emotion.“If it isn’t presumptuous of me, sir, I wish your brother was still alive.”Drain had served as the CIA liaison to Foster in the final months of his life.If he thought that invoking the memory of Dulles’s late brother would light afire under the spymaster, Drain was wrong. Dulles simply nodded and stared aheadat the road. By the time they reached the house on Q Street, Drain was deeplyuncomfortable in his boss’s presence and eager to flee back to his CIA commandpost. But Dulles insisted that he come inside for a drink.When the two men settled into armchairs in Dulles’s library with tumblers ofScotch in hand, Drain thought the chief would finally grill him on the detailsof the failing operation. Instead, the evening only became more surreal.“Dick, you served in Greece, didn’t you?” Dulles inquired. “I have to go to theWhite House tomorrow to a reception for [Greek Prime Minister Constantine]Karamanlis. Can you refresh my memory about him?”The stunned CIA officer strung together some kind of reply and made his exitshortly after.For years after the Bay of Pigs, Washington insiders and scholars tried tounravel the mystery of Dulles’s AWOL behavior during the critical CIA operation.Some explained that his absence was part of his modus operandi—he was in thehabit of leaving Washington on the eve of critical missions to make it seem asif nothing significant was about to occur. Dulles himself airily dismissed hisstrangely timed Puerto Rico trip. He had planned the Young Presidents speakingengagement months before, he explained, and if he had canceled at the lastminute, it would have created suspicions. Besides, he added, “I knew I could getback with the speed of aircraft; it was only a question of six or eight hours.”But the CIA’s own official history of the Cuba fiasco, prepared in the late1970s and early ’80s, concluded that Dulles’s absence was “inexcusable.” Dulles,the report added, “was the one man who might have persuaded the president topermit the D-Day [air] strike.”Some of the sharpest criticisms of the Bay of Pigs operation, in fact, came fromwithin the CIA itself. Dick Drain was among those who later aimed fire atDulles, when he spoke with Jack Pfeiffer, the CIA historian who prepared thevoluminous report on the Bay of Pigs. Drain was a gung ho officer who fit theagency profile, right down to membership in Yale’s secretive Skull and Bonessociety (Class of ’43). But years after he picked up Dulles at the Baltimoreairport, Drain vented about the agency’s handling of the doomed Cuba enterprise.He was astounded by the poor quality of the staff assigned to the high-stakesBay of Pigs operation, Drain told Pfeiffer, despite Dulles’s insistence that itwould be run by the agency’s best and brightest. “Allen Dulles, always meaningwhat he said, would say repeatedly, ‘Now I want the very best people assigned tothis project. There is nothing more important that we are doing than this. . . .I want people pulled out of tours overseas if necessary, this thing must bemanned.’”But in truth, said Drain, the Bay of Pigs operation drew agency castoffs. “Wewould tend to get the people that the [CIA] division chiefs found ‘excess’—whichnormally meant found insufficient. With many notable exceptions, we did not getthe very best people available.”Even he himself, Drain admitted, was not qualified to play a leading role in theoperation. “I don’t mean to be unduly immodest [sic], but really I didn’t haveany qualifications for this [job] except I was there and unemployed—had noSpanish language whatsoever, and my entire exposure had been punching cows inArizona in 1940. That doesn’t really bring you up much on Latin America andLatinos, and any of that. I had never been on amphibious operations, and if thatwas characteristic of my qualifications, it really characterized the whole damnoperation—about which, it seemed to me, there was a good deal of well-meaninghypocrisy.”Drain’s criticisms of the enterprise echoed those in an earlier CIA report, thedamning internal investigation carried out by the agency’s inspector general,Lyman Kirkpatrick, in the months immediately following the disaster. TheKirkpatrick Report, one of the most surprisingly honest self-evaluations everproduced within the CIA, found that despite Dulles’s insistence on “high-qualitypersonnel,” the Bay of Pigs operation was staffed largely by the agency’slosers. According to CIA files, seventeen of the forty-two officers assigned tothe operation were ranked in the lowest third of the agency, and nine wereranked in the lowest tenth. The IG’s report concluded that Dulles had allowedhis division chiefs to dump “their disposal cases” on the Cuba project.Robert Amory Jr., the CIA’s highly respected chief of analysis, was one of thosewho was inexplicably kept away from the Bay of Pigs operation, despite hisextensive experience with beach landings as an Army Corps of Engineers officerin the South Pacific during World War II. Amory—who had literally written thebook on the subject, Surf and Sand, a regimental history of his twenty-sixamphibious operations—was stunned by Dulles and Bissell’s decision to keep himon the sidelines. The CIA men sent to Miami to work with the exile leaders andto Guatemala to help train the brigadistas were “a bunch of guys who wereotherwise not needed,” Amory later recalled. “They were a strange bunch ofpeople with German experience, Arabic experience, and other things like that.And most of them had no knowledge of Spanish . . . and absolutely no sense orfeel about the political sensitivities of these [Cuban exiles]. . . . I think wecould have had an A team, instead of being a C-minus team.”The Kirkpatrick Report detailed a number of other glaring errors made by Dulles,Bissell, and their Bay of Pigs team. When plans for the Cuba invasion grew moreambitious and began leaking to the press as early as November 1960, the reportstated, the CIA should have terminated its role in the mission since it hadoutgrown the agency’s covert capability. “When the project became blown to everynewspaper reader,” the report noted acerbically, “the agency should haveinformed higher authority that it was no longer operating in its charter.” Thecriticisms went on and on, each one more devastating than the last. “As theproject grew, the agency reduced the exiled leaders to the status of puppets. .. . The project was badly organized. . . . The agency became so wrapped up inthe military operation that it failed to appraise the chances of successrealistically. Furthermore, it failed to keep [the president and his]policymakers adequately and realistically informed of the conditions essentialfor success.”Kirkpatrick, who prepared his devastating report with the help of threeinvestigators, flatly rejected the main CIA alibi for the failed mission—thatKennedy was to blame by blocking the agency’s last-minute requests for airstrikes. The invasion was “doomed” from the start by the CIA’s poor planning,the inspector general concluded. Even if the air strikes had allowed theinvaders to move inland from the shore, his report stated, the “men wouldeventually have been crushed by Castro’s combined military resourcesstrengthened by Soviet Bloc–supplied military materiel.”Perhaps the most devastating revelation about the CIA operation emerged yearslater, in 2005, when the agency was compelled to release the minutes of ameeting held by its Cuba task force on November 15, 1960, one week afterKennedy’s election. The group, which was deliberating on how to brief thepresident-elect on the pending invasion, came to an eye-opening conclusion. Inthe face of strong security measures that Castro had implemented, the CIA taskforce admitted, their invasion plan was “now seen to be unachievable, except asa joint [CIA/Department of Defense] action.” In other words, the CIA realizedthat its Bay of Pigs expedition was doomed to fail unless its exile brigade wasreinforced by the power of the U.S. military. But the CIA never shared thissobering assessment with the president.Nor did Dulles and Bissell share with Kennedy their other “magic bullet” forsuccess in Cuba—the agency’s ongoing plot with the Mafia to assassinate Castro,which had been authorized by Eisenhower. With Cuba’s revolutionary governmentdecapitated, CIA officials were certain that the regime would soon topple. Butthe Cuban leader had learned from the annals of imperial history and had wiselytaken precautions against such plots. He would thwart his enemies for decades tocome, as he grew from a young firebrand to a gray-bearded legend.Dulles and Bissell knew that Kennedy was deeply torn over the Cuba invasionplan. His denunciations of Western imperialism had raised high hopes throughoutthe hemisphere that the days of heavy-handed Yanqui interference were coming toan end. “Kennedy’s election has given rise to an enormous expectancy throughoutLatin America,” Schlesinger noted in his journal in early February 1961. “Theysee him as another FDR; they expect great things from him.” But Kennedy had alsocampaigned for a strong, though undefined, response to Castro. Eisenhower’sfinal words of advice to him were to take out the Cuban leader—and he leftbehind an invasion plan and assassination plot to do just that. As William Bundyobserved, the old general had handed Kennedy “a grenade with the pin pulled”—ifhe didn’t use it, it could blow up in his face, with serious politicalconsequences.Kennedy agonized over giving final authorization for the Bay of Pigs plan to thevery end. He kept downsizing the operation, to make it as little “noisy” aspossible. “What the president really wanted, it seems, was for the CIA to pulloff the neat trick of invading Cuba without actually invading it; an immaculateinvasion, as it were . . . without all the messy business along the way,”observed historian Jim Rasenberger.Dulles kept accommodating the anxious Kennedy, convinced that once thebrigadistas hit the beaches, JFK would be forced to do anything necessary forsuccess—even if that meant getting very noisy and messy. The wily CIA chief seta trap for Kennedy, allowing the president to believe that his “immaculateinvasion” could succeed, even though Dulles knew that only U.S. soldiers andplanes could ensure that.Years after the Bay of Pigs, historians—including the CIA’s own JackPfeiffer—painted a portrait of Dulles as a spymaster in decline, bumbling anddisengaged and maybe too advanced in years, at age sixty-eight, for the rigorsof his job. Only a spy chief with a shaky grasp on the tiller could haveoverlooked the deep flaws embedded in the Bay of Pigs strategy, it was stated.But, as usual, there was method to Dulles’s seeming carelessness. It is nowclear that the CIA’s Bay of Pigs expedition was not simply doomed to fail, itwas meant to fail. And its failure was designed to trigger the real action—anall-out, U.S. military invasion of the island. Dulles plunged ahead with hishopeless, paramilitary mission—an expedition that he had staffed with “C-minus”officers and expendable Cuban “puppets”—because he was serenely confident that,in the heat of battle, Kennedy would be forced to send the Marines crashingashore. Dulles was banking on the young, untested commander in chief to cave into pressure from the Washington war machine, just as other presidents had bentto the spymaster’s will.It was Dick Bissell, the man in charge of the high-stakes operation, who stoodto lose the most when the motley brigade of Cuban patriots and cutthroatsinevitably bogged down on the beaches. That was perfectly fine with Dulles, whohad been content all along for Bissell to take the lead on the Bay of Pigs—andalso the heat. Bissell supported Dulles’s decision to fly off to Puerto Rico onthe eve of the mission. The ambitious deputy director was eager to run his ownshow. JFK had put out the word that Bissell was going to replace Dulles by July,and the supremely confident Bissell thought it was time to show what he coulddo. “I was prepared to run it as a single-handed operation,” he later said. “Iwas impatient if Dulles raised too many questions.”Dulles was only too pleased to accommodate his rising deputy. As the missionwent to hell, the CIA chief would be far from the Washington inferno. By thetime Dulles returned home from his Puerto Rico retreat, he would look like oneof the grown-ups riding to the rescue. The spymaster and the Pentagon brasswould make the new president see that he had no choice: he had to escalate thefighting in Cuba and march all the way to Havana. Afterward, as the dustsettled, if Bissell suffered an unfortunate career reversal because hisill-conceived escapade had to be salvaged by the big boys, well, so be it. Afterall, he was the face of the Cuba mission, just as Dulles had made him the frontman for the risky U-2 enterprise and the assassination operations againstforeign leaders.Years later, Bob Amory would acknowledge that JFK was indeed “a little bittrapped” by the CIA on the Bay of Pigs, though Amory himself had nothing to dowith it. But if Dulles thought he could force Kennedy to carry out his Cubaplan, he had seriously underestimated the young man in the White House.Around midnight on Tuesday, April 18, in the midst of the unfolding fiasco, someof the principal advocates for a bigger war in Cuba made one final assault onKennedy, gathering with him in the Oval Office after the annual congressionalparty in the East Room. Among those pressing the case for escalation wereBissell and two longtime Pentagon allies of Dulles, Joint Chiefs chairman LymanLemnitzer and Navy chief Arleigh Burke. Dulles was absent, still keeping hisdistance from the mess and hoping that Bissell would take the fall for it. TheCIA director was placing his confidence in Lemnitzer and Burke, hoping that thetwo blunt-spoken, highly decorated warriors could strong-arm Kennedy intounleashing the U.S. military. The president was still in formalwhite-tie-and-black-tails attire from the East Room party, and the military menwere in their full dress uniforms. But there was nothing polite or decorativeabout the intense discussion in the president’s office.Admiral Burke was especially gruff with Kennedy, treating him as if he were aweak-kneed ensign. Without informing the president, Burke had already taken theliberty of positioning two battalions of Marines on Navy destroyers off thecoast of Cuba, “anticipating that U.S. forces might be ordered into Cuba tosalvage a botched invasion.” It was one of many extraordinary acts of Pentagonand CIA insubordination that plagued the Kennedy presidency from the verybeginning. Now the Navy chief was browbeating Kennedy into taking the firststeps toward a full-scale war with Castro.“Let me take two jets and shoot down the enemy aircraft,” growled “31-Knot”Burke, who had become legendary for his speed and daring as a destroyer squadroncommander in the South Pacific during the war, while JFK was a mere PT boatcaptain. But by this point in the unfolding disaster, Kennedy was not inclinedto take any more advice from his national security wise men, even if they wereWorld War II idols. “What if Castro’s forces return fire and hit the destroyer?”Kennedy sensibly asked.“Then we’ll knock the hell out of them!” Burke bellowed.Now Kennedy began to show some of his own icy, if more restrained, temper. Hehad made it clear all along that he did not want the Bay of Pigs to blow up intoan international crisis with the United States in the middle—and here was hisNavy chief urging just such a course of action. “Burke, I don’t want the UnitedStates involved in this,” he firmly repeated one more time.“Hell, Mr. President,” the admiral shot back, “but we are involved!”But Kennedy stood his ground. As he had repeatedly warned them, there would beno air strikes, no Marine landings—and the fate of the Bay of Pigs operation wassealed.“They were sure I’d give in to them,” Kennedy later told Dave Powers. “Theycouldn’t believe that a new president like me wouldn’t panic and try to save hisown face. Well they had me figured all wrong.”JFK was even more vehement when he spoke with another old friend, Paul “Red” FayJr., whom Kennedy installed as undersecretary of the Navy. “Nobody is going toforce me to do anything I don’t think is in the best interests of the country,”he vented. “We’re not going to plunge into irresponsible action just because afanatical fringe in the country puts so-called national pride above nationalreason.”As the last of the brigadistas were rounded up by Castro’s troops in the swampssurrounding the Bay of Pigs, Dulles seemed shell-shocked. He had never suffereda humiliation like this in his career. Seeking consolation, Dulles made aThursday night dinner date with his old protégé, Dick Nixon. The spymaster wasacutely aware that if Nixon had been the one sitting in the White House, theevents in Cuba would have taken a much different course. When he finally arrivedat the Washington residence that Nixon still maintained, over an hour late,Dulles did not seem himself. It looked to Nixon like he was under “greatemotional stress.” The CIA chief shuffled in wearing slippers—a sign that he wasin the midst of another agonizing gout attack, the recurring affliction thatseemed to strike whenever Dulles was entangled in a high-stress operation. Afterasking for a drink, the Old Man collapsed into a chair and exhaled, “This hasbeen the worst day of my life.”If Dulles thought he could escape Kennedy’s wrath by making Bissell thescapegoat, he was deeply mistaken. Both CIA officials would eventually beousted, but JFK placed most of the blame squarely on the top man. The CIA chieflater swore that he never “sold” the president on the Bay of Pigs scheme. “Oneought never to sell anybody a bill of goods,” he told an interviewer for the JFKPresidential Library. But Kennedy knew the truth. Dulles had lied to his face inthe Oval Office about the chances for the operation’s success. “I stood righthere at Ike’s desk,” Dulles told JFK on the eve of the invasion, “and I told himI was certain our Guatemalan operation would succeed—and, Mr. President, theprospects for this plan are even better than they were for that one.”Kennedy and Dulles had not gotten off to a good start with each other during thefirst months of the new presidency. The minor rifts and strains beganaccumulating from the very beginning. Still wedded to the ancien régime, Dullesnever hung an official portrait of President Kennedy in the CIA headquarters.The CIA director immediately created an atmosphere of distrust between hisagency and the White House, telling his deputies to make sure that theyretrieved any sensitive documents they showed to Kennedy’s staff, so they didn’twind up in White House files. Dulles “didn’t really feel comfortable with”Kennedy, observed Bob Amory.The spymaster regarded the young New Frontiersmen Kennedy brought into hisadministration as if they were an alien force. In February 1961, AdamYarmolinksy, one of the young Ivy League–educated “whiz kids” assembled byDefense Secretary Robert McNamara to modernize the management of the Pentagon,scheduled an appointment with Dulles. Before the meeting, the spymasterrequested a report on Yarmolinsky from CIA general counsel Lawrence Houston, asif he were meeting a foreign official. Dulles was briefed about Yarmolinsky’sliberal inclinations by Houston, who then phoned the director’s office withadditional observations about the young Kennedy official. “Mr. Houston says[Yarmolinksy] is an extremely bright fellow,” reported the Dulles aide who tookthe phone call, “although not particularly personally attractive. He is ofRussian-Jewish background.”Dulles insisted on personally handling all of the agency’s briefings at theWhite House, but JFK—who was more widely traveled and sophisticated about globalaffairs than his age would indicate—did not think much of the CIA chief’spresentations. He found Dulles patronizing and uninformative. According to WhiteHouse aide Theodore Sorensen, Kennedy “was not very impressed with Dulles’sbriefings. He did not think they were in much depth or told him anything hecouldn’t read in the newspapers.”But if relations between Kennedy and Dulles were strained before the Bay ofPigs, afterward they were all but nonexistent. Kennedy made it clear that he nolonger wanted to be briefed by Dulles, so the agency began sending him briefingbooklets called the President’s Intelligence Checklist, filled with shortsummaries of world developments. Kennedy clearly preferred this method, firingoff follow-up questions to the agency, along with requests to see sourcematerials, such as the complete text of speeches by foreign leaders and theunabridged versions of CIA reports.In public, the president took full blame for the Cuba fiasco. And Kennedyremained personally courteous in his face-to-face dealings with Dulles. “Therewas never any recrimination on the president’s part,” Dulles later recalled. “Imight well have lost to some extent in the measure of confidence he placed onme—that’s inevitable in things of this kind, I think, but I may say in hispersonal attitude toward me, in the many meetings we had, he never let thatappear.”But behind the scenes, Dulles waged a vigorous battle with Kennedy to controlthe media spin on the Bay of Pigs and to hold on to his command of the CIA. Theintelligence chief took immediate steps to rally his corporate base of support.On May 1, Dulles convened a private meeting of CEOs to discuss “current problemsconfronting business enterprise in Latin America and specific ways of meetingthem.” The gathering at New York’s Metropolitan Club—which Dulles emphasized was“strictly off the record”—gave the spymaster and his corporate clientele anopportunity to reevaluate their strategy in the post–Bay of Pigs climate.Dulles’s corporate circle encouraged his aggressive political tactics by sendinghim supportive messages. Charles Hilles Jr., executive vice president of ITT,was among those who wrote Dulles to buck him up after the Cuban catastrophe. “Ihave the greatest admiration for your calmness and fortitude, and for yourdevotion to the country’s good,” wrote Hilles on May 4, “and I sense that I amone of an overwhelming majority.” The following month, a conservative New Yorkcorporate attorney named Watson “Watty” Washburn, known as a tennis wizard inhis youth and later as the attorney who defended P. G. Wodehouse against theIRS, offered Dulles more militant encouragement. Washburn urged Dulles to sloughoff his earlier failure and organize a new invasion of Cuba to liberate the Bayof Pigs captives from Castro’s prison on the Isle of Pines. “This would be merechild’s play as a military operation,” assured Washburn, “and would qualify asan humanitarian enterprise rather than ‘imperialism.’”If Dulles had lost the battle at the Bay of Pigs, he was determined to win thewar of ideas over the failed operation. He began his psywar campaign by sendingan all-station cable to CIA personnel with his version of the Cuba disaster.According to Ralph McGehee, a twenty-five-year CIA veteran serving in Vietnam atthe time, Dulles’s cable to his troops “implied that had events taken theirplanned course, we would have been victorious in [the] invasion of Cuba.” TheDulles message, which the Old Man continued to promote for the rest of his life,was emphatically clear: the mission had been doomed by Kennedy’s failure ofnerve, or, as he put it more diplomatically in his unpublished article forHarper’s, by the president’s lack of “determination to succeed.”Years after the Bay of Pigs, Dulles was still spinning reporters, scholars, andanyone else who showed an interest in the fading story. In April 1965, when aHarvard Business School student named L. Paul Bremer III—who would find his ownplace in the annals of American disasters as President George W. Bush’sproconsul in Iraq—sent Dulles his dissertation on the Bay of Pigs, the spymastersought to correct the young man’s impression that it was a CIA failure. It wasKennedy’s “final decision to eliminate the air action” that had killed theexpedition, Dulles wrote Bremer. “I can assure you that it would never have beenmounted . . . if it had been even suspected that this vital element of the planwould be eliminated.”Dulles’s spin on the Bay of Pigs began appearing in the press as soon as thesmoke cleared from the invasion. His version received prominent play in aSeptember 1961 Fortune magazine article titled “Cuba: The Record Set Straight.”The article was written by Fortune staff writer Charles Murphy, a journalist soclose to Dulles that the spymaster used him as a ghostwriter. The previous year,Murphy had fawningly agreed to write a Dulles memoir, telling the CIA chief “youhave honored me with your invitation to me to lend a hand with your book, and Iam looking forward to the association.” Much of Murphy’s article in Fortunesounded like it was dictated directly by Dulles, shifting blame from the CIA tothe White House. Murphy later claimed that Admiral Burke had been his source,but the Kennedy brothers suspected that Dulles’s deputy, General Charles Cabell,was also involved.Kennedy was furious about the Fortune article, and he had the White Houseprepare a point-by-point rebuttal for publisher Henry Luce. The media-savvypresident knew that he was confronting a formidable opponent in the war of ideasover Cuba. At his first press conference following the Bay of Pigs, JFK put theWashington press corps on alert, telling reporters, “I wouldn’t be surprised ifinformation wasn’t poured into you” from “interested agencies.”If the president could not match Dulles’s wide network of media assets, hebrought his own impressive skills to the public relations war with the CIA.Kennedy was adept at massaging influential journalists like New York TimesWashington columnist James “Scotty” Reston. While the Bay of Pigs disaster wasstill unfolding, JFK invited Reston to lunch at the White House, confiding tohim, “I probably made a mistake in keeping Allen Dulles on. . . . I have neverworked with him and therefore I can’t estimate his meaning when he tells methings. . . . Dulles is a legendary figure, and it’s hard to operate withlegendary figures. . . . It’s a hell of a way to learn things, but I havelearned one thing from this business—that is, that we will have to deal with theCIA.”Word quickly got back to CIA headquarters that if Kennedy was taking the blamein public for the Bay of Pigs, he was privately stabbing Dulles and the agencywith his sharp invective, vowing to “splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces andscatter it to the winds.”Kennedy deployed two of his most passionately loyal White House aides, Sorensenand Schlesinger, in the war of words with Dulles’s empire. Both men brought acutting eloquence to the political duel. The week after the Bay of Pigs,Schlesinger, who had adamantly opposed the operation, observed, “We not onlylook like imperialists . . . we look like stupid, ineffectual imperialists. . .. Allen Dulles and Dick Bissell brought down in a day what Kennedy had beenlaboring patiently and successfully to build up in three months.”Dulles knew that JFK was maneuvering to dump him, but he made it clear that hewould not go without a fight. On May 23, Schlesinger discussed the CIAdirector’s fate with Dulles’s mole in the White House, Mac Bundy. Bundy, nodoubt channeling his headstrong patron, told Schlesinger that “there would beserious difficulties about procuring the resignation of Allen Dulles.” Accordingto Bundy, Dulles believed that “his only mistake was in not having persuaded thepresident that he must send in the Marines.”As JFK’s national security adviser, Bundy was in a delicate position, trying toearn the confidence of the president whom he had just begun serving, while atthe same time subtly advocating for Dulles. In the midst of the Bay of Pigscrisis, Bundy had tried to turn Bissell into the scapegoat. He told Schlesingerthat Dulles “actually had more misgivings about the project than he had everexpressed to the president, and that he had not done so out of loyalty toBissell.” Bundy added that “he personally would not be able to accept Dick’sestimates of a situation like this again.” Bundy, who had endorsed the Bay ofPigs plan, was clearly acting on Dulles’s behalf when he threw Bissell under thebus. But he failed to halt the White House momentum that was building forDulles’s termination.The battle over Dulles’s future as CIA director came to a head during thepresidential investigation of the Bay of Pigs debacle. A few days after thefailed invasion, Kennedy appointed General Maxwell Taylor to chair the officialinquiry. Taylor, who would later become JFK’s military adviser, was closelyaligned with Dulles. Fletcher Prouty, an astute observer of Dulles’s far-flungWashington network, later called Taylor another key “CIA man at the WhiteHouse.” Dulles, who was appointed to the Taylor Committee along with his allyAdmiral Burke, must have thought he had the Bay of Pigs panel tightly wired—justthe way he had controlled the blue-ribbon CIA oversight committees during theEisenhower era.But Max Taylor also felt a sense of loyalty to Kennedy, who had championed thehandsome, ramrod-straight general when Taylor broke with the Eisenhower-Dullespolicy of massive retaliation in favor of a more nuanced strategy he called“flexible response.” JFK, who was influenced by Taylor’s 1959 book, TheUncertain Trumpet, called the scholarly Taylor “my kind of general.” As chair ofthe investigation, Taylor maintained a delicate balance, striving diplomaticallyto avoid putting too much blame on the CIA or the Pentagon. But Taylor’s“strongest tilts,” in the estimation of CIA historian Jack Pfeiffer, “weretoward deflecting criticism of the White House.”Meanwhile, Bobby Kennedy, whom Pfeiffer archly observed “crossed all lines asthe president’s alter ego,” used his position on the Taylor Committee to makesure his brother would be protected. The young, sharp-elbowed attorney generalproved to be a tougher advocate for the White House than Dulles and ArleighBurke were for their respective institutions. RFK deftly blocked the two Kennedyantagonists from focusing blame on the president. As the committee completed itsreport, Dulles and Burke were reduced to lobbying Taylor to at least insert afootnote stating that if Kennedy had approved air coverage of the landing, “itcould well have caused a chain reaction of success throughout Cuba, withresultant defection of some of [Castro’s] Militia, the uprising of the populaceand eventual success of the operation.” But this hypothetical scenario was apipe dream that only Dulles and Burke were smoking.Nearly two decades later, Pfeiffer’s Bay of Pigs history still reflected agencyresentment at how JFK’s brother outmaneuvered the CIA and Pentagon during theTaylor investigation. “At the conclusion of the testimony of the witnesses,”Pfeiffer wrote, “it was clear that Burke and Dulles . . . were headed for theelephants’ burial ground—thanks to Robert Kennedy’s denigration of them andtheir Agencies and, in no small part in the case of Dulles to his abysmalperformance as a witness.” By the end of the investigation, wrote Pfeiffer, theoutplayed Dulles and Burke “were nattering at each other” over how much of theresponsibility for the disaster the Navy should share with the CIA.If the Taylor Committee, which presented its findings to Kennedy on May 16,badly damaged Dulles, the Kirkpatrick Report sealed his fate. Tall, handsome,athletic, and charming, Lyman Kirkpatrick had been one of the agency’s risingstars. A graduate of Deerfield and Princeton, he served with the OSS and as anintelligence adviser to General Omar Bradley during the war. A streak of daringran through the Kirkpatrick family. His sister, Helen, was an intrepid warcorrespondent, riding with the tanks of the Free French Forces to liberateParis. Photos of the attractive reporter in a combat helmet and tailored uniformgave her dispatches for the Chicago Daily News a glamorous flair. After the war,Lyman Kirkpatrick joined the CIA in its infancy and made his way quickly up theranks, becoming CIA chief Beetle Smith’s right-hand man. Kirkpatrick appeared tobe on a fast track to the top of the agency, as covert action chief and thenperhaps director.But in 1952, he was stricken by polio while on assignment in Asia. After a longhospitalization—including a nightmarish ordeal at Walter Reed Hospital, whereDulles had pulled strings to get him admitted—Kirkpatrick returned to the CIA.He was paralyzed from the waist down and confined to a wheelchair, but he wasdetermined to resume his career. Dulles, who had just taken over the CIA,appointed Kirkpatrick inspector general—an unpopular post since it involvedmonitoring the agency’s internal affairs. By accepting the job, Kirkpatrick wasacknowledging that his hopes for the top office were gone. But he demonstratedintegrity as IG, recommending that the CIA employees who were responsible forthe 1953 death of MKULTRA victim Frank Olson be punished, although they neverwere. Kirkpatrick also went on record within the agency as opposing theassassination of Lumumba.Kirkpatrick, who had worked with Joe Kennedy on Eisenhower’s intelligenceadvisory board, belonged to the pro-Kennedy faction inside the CIA. Kirkpatrickand JFK were on friendly terms. The president, who knew how important swimmingexercises had been for the polio-afflicted Franklin Roosevelt, invitedKirkpatrick to use the White House pool, where Kennedy swam to ease his own backailments. It was Kirkpatrick who noticed that there was no official portrait ofPresident Kennedy on display at CIA headquarters, and after Dulles had left theagency, the inspector general arranged for one finally to be hung.Still, Kirkpatrick was a lifelong CIA man, and he owed his resurrected career toDulles. So the Old Man felt deeply betrayed when Kirkpatrick handed him and hisdeputy, Charles Cabell, copies of the highly critical Bay of Pigs autopsy. Afurious Dulles denounced the report as a “hatchet job.” Dulles and Cabell “wereboth exceedingly shocked and upset, irritated and annoyed and mad and everythingelse,” Kirkpatrick recalled.Agency loyalists like Sam Halpern began spreading the word that Kirkpatrick wasacting out of acrimony. The report was “basically Kirk’s vendetta againstBissell,” said Halpern years later, still promoting the agency line. “He hadbeen a real rising star. Once he had polio, he got sidetracked and became abitter man.” But, in truth, Kirkpatrick was a man of conscience. “When you speakhonestly about what people did wrong, you’re going to step on toes,” saidKirkpatrick’s son, Lyman Jr., a retired Army intelligence colonel. “But that washis job.”Dulles succeeded in suppressing the Kirkpatrick Report; it would remain lockedaway until the CIA was finally compelled to release it in 1998. But as wordspread in Washington circles about the harsh report, it added to theanti-Kennedy passions flaring within the CIA.The Bay of Pigs debacle produced a “stuttering rage” among CIA officers alignedwith Dulles, according to CIA veteran Joseph B. Smith—especially among those onthe Cuba task force. “I had the feeling all those [agents] there felt almostthat the world had ended,” Smith remembered. In August, months after the failedventure, when longtime veteran Ralph McGehee returned from Vietnam to agencyheadquarters, he, too, found the CIA in turmoil. Rumors spread that Kennedy wasgoing to exact his revenge by slashing the CIA workforce through a massive“reduction in force,” code-named the “701 program” by the agency.“It seemed [to us] that the RIF program was aimed more at the CIA than otheragencies,” McGehee observed. “This was a tension-filled, dismal time. . . . Thehalls seemed filled with the strained, anxious looks of the soon-to-beunemployed.”When Kennedy’s ax did fall, McGehee was stunned by the carnage. “About one ofevery five was fired. The tension became too much for some. On severaloccasions, one of my former office mates came to the office howling drunk andworked his way onto the 701 list.”The anti-Kennedy rage inside CIA headquarters also reverberated at the Pentagon.“Pulling out the rug [on the Bay of Pigs invaders],” fumed Joint Chiefs chairmanLemnitzer, was “unbelievable . . . absolutely reprehensible, almost criminal.”Years later, the name Kennedy still made “31-Knot” Burke boil over. “Mr.Kennedy,” the admiral told an oral historian from the U.S. Naval Institute, “wasa very bad president. . . . He permitted himself to jeopardize the nation.” TheKennedy team, he added, “didn’t realize the power of the United States or how touse the power of the United States. It was a game to them. . . . They wereinexperienced people.”If Kennedy’s national security mandarins were filled with contempt for him, thefeeling was clearly mutual. On the heels of the Bay of Pigs, when Lemnitzerurged militant action in other hot spots such as Laos, the president brushed himoff. He disliked even being in the same room with the men who had led him astrayon Cuba. JFK “dismissed [Lemnitzer and the others] as a bunch of old men,”Schlesinger recalled years later. “He thought Lemnitzer was a dope.”Kennedy’s vice president, Lyndon Johnson, was disturbed by JFK’s growingestrangement from the military and the CIA. “Of course, Johnson was a greatadmirer of the military,” recalled Jack Bell, a White House reporter for theAssociated Press. “He didn’t believe that Kennedy was paying enough attention tothe military leaders.”Chatting with Bell one day, LBJ told the reporter, “You don’t hardly ever seethe chiefs of staff around [the White House] anymore.” As Johnson was painfullyaware, he was not part of JFK’s inner circle either—“he just sat around with histhumb in his mouth,” as Bell put it.It was Bobby, the tough kid brother reviled by Johnson, who was the president’sindispensable partner. “Every time they have a conference down there [at theWhite House], don’t kid anybody about who was the top adviser,” Johnson bitterlytold Bell. “It isn’t McNamara, the chiefs of staff, or anybody else like that.Bobby is first in and last out. And Bobby is the boy he listens to.”It was Cuba that created the first fracture between Kennedy and his nationalsecurity chain of command. But while the Bay of Pigs was still dominating thefront pages, the CIA mucked its way into another international crisis thatrequired the president’s urgent attention. The Cuba invasion has all but erasedthis second crisis from history. But the strange events that occurred in Parisin April 1961 reinforced the disturbing feeling that President Kennedy was notin control of his own government.Paris was in turmoil. At dawn on Saturday morning, April 22, a group of retiredFrench generals had seized power in Algiers to block President Charles de Gaullefrom settling the long, bloody war for Algerian independence. Rumors quicklyspread that the coup plotters were coming next for de Gaulle himself, and thatthe skies over Paris would soon be filled with battle-hardened paratroopers andFrench Foreign Legionnaires from Algeria. Gripped by the dying convulsions ofits colonial reign, France braced for a calamitous showdown.The threat to French democracy was actually even more immediate than feared. OnSaturday evening, two units of paratroopers totaling over two thousand menhuddled in the Forest of Orleans and the Forest of Rambouillet, not much morethan an hour outside Paris. The rebellious paratroopers were poised for thefinal command to join up with tank units from Rambouillet and converge on thecapital, with the aim of seizing the Élysée Palace and other key governmentposts. By Sunday, panic was sweeping through Paris. All air traffic was haltedover the area, the Metro was shut down, and cinemas were dark. Only the cafésremained open, where Parisians crowded anxiously to swap the latest gossip.News that the coup was being led by the widely admired Maurice Challe, a formerair force chief and commander of French forces in Algeria, stunned thegovernment in Paris, from de Gaulle down. Challe, a squat, quiet man, was aWorld War II hero and, so it had seemed, a loyal Gaullist. But the savagepassions of the war in Algeria had deeply affected Challe and left himvulnerable to the persuasions of more zealous French officers. He had promisedAlgeria’s French settlers and pro-French Muslims that they would not beabandoned, and he felt a soldierly responsibility to stand by his oath, as wellas by the memory of the French servicemen who had lost their lives in the war.In his radio broadcast to the people of France, the coup leader explained thathe was taking his stand against de Gaulle’s “government of capitulation . . . sothat our dead shall not have died for nothing.”De Gaulle quickly concluded that Challe must be acting with the support of U.S.intelligence, and Élysée officials began spreading this word to the press.Shortly before his resignation from the French military, Challe had served asNATO commander in chief, and he had developed close relations with a number ofhigh-ranking U.S. officers stationed in the military alliance’s Fontainebleauheadquarters. Challe and American security officials shared a deep disaffectionwith de Gaulle. The stubborn, seventy-year-old pillar of French nationalism wasviewed as a growing obstacle to U.S. ambitions for NATO because he refused toincorporate French troops under allied command and insisted on building aseparate nuclear force beyond Washington’s control. De Gaulle’s enemies in Parisand Washington were also convinced that the French president’s awkward stepstoward granting Algerian independence threatened to create a “Soviet base” instrategic, oil-rich North Africa.In panic-gripped Paris, reports of U.S. involvement in the coup fillednewspapers across the political spectrum. Geneviève Tabouis, a columnist forParis-Jour, zeroed in directly on Dulles as the main culprit in an articleheadlined “The Strategy of Allen Dulles.” Other news reports revealed thatJacques Soustelle—a former governor-general of Algeria who joined the SecretArmy Organization (Organisation de l’Armée Secrète, or OAS), a notorious anti–deGaulle terrorist group—had a luncheon meeting with Richard Bissell in Washingtonthe previous December.De Gaulle’s foreign ministry was the source of some of the most provocativecharges in the press, including the allegation that CIA agents sought fundingfor the Challe coup from multinational corporations, such as Belgian miningcompanies operating in the Congo. Ministry officials also alleged that Americanswith ties to extremist groups had surfaced in Paris during the coup drama,including one identified as a “political counselor for the Luce [media] group,”who was heard to say, “An operation is being prepared in Algiers to put a stopto communism, and we will not fail as we did in Cuba.”Stories about the CIA’s French intrigues soon began spreading to the Americanpress. A Paris correspondent for The Washington Post reported that Challe hadlaunched his revolt “because he was convinced he had unqualified Americansupport”—assurances, Challe was led to believe, “emanating from PresidentKennedy himself.” Who gave these assurances, the Post reporter asked his Frenchsources? The Pentagon, the CIA? “It’s the same thing,” he was told.Dulles was forced to issue a strong denial of CIA involvement in the putsch.“Any reports or allegations that the Central Intelligence Agency or any of itspersonnel had anything to do with the generals’ revolt were completely false,”the spymaster declared, blaming Moscow for spreading the charges.C. L. Sulzberger, the CIA-friendly New York Times columnist, took up theagency’s defense, echoing Dulles’s indignant denial. “To set the recordstraight,” Sulzberger wrote, sounding like an agency official, “our Governmentbehaved with discretion, wisdom and propriety during the [French] insurrection.This applies to all branches, [including] the CIA.” Years later, investigativereporter Carl Bernstein exposed the ties between Sulzberger and the CIA. “YoungCy Sulzberger had some uses,” a CIA official told Bernstein. “He was very eager,he loved to cooperate.” (Bernstein conveniently left unexamined the long historyof cooperation between the CIA and his own former employer, The WashingtonPost.)But The New York Times’s Scotty Reston was more aligned with the sentiments ofthe Kennedy White House. Echoing the charges circulating in the French press,Reston reported that the CIA was indeed “involved in an embarrassing liaisonwith the anti-Gaullist officers.” Reston communicated the rising fury in JFK’sinner circle over the CIA’s rogue behavior, in the wake of the Bay of Pigsfiasco and the French escapade: “All this has increased the feeling in the WhiteHouse that the CIA has gone beyond the bounds of an objectiveintelligence-gathering agency and has become the advocate of men and policiesthat have embarrassed the Administration.”Allen Dulles was once again making his own policy, this time in France. Therewas a long history of acrimony between Dulles and de Gaulle, dating back toWorld War II and the complex internal politics of the French Resistance. As OSSchief in Switzerland, Dulles favored a far right faction of the Resistance thatwas opposed to de Gaulle. In his war memoirs, de Gaulle accused Dulles of beingpart of “a scheme” that was determined to “silence or set aside” the Frenchgeneral. Pierre de Bénouville, a right-wing Resistance leader on Dulles’s OSSpayroll, was later accused of betraying Jean Moulin, de Gaulle’s dashingrepresentative in the French underground, to the Gestapo. After he was captured,Moulin was subjected to brutal torture before being beaten to death—by thenotorious war criminal Klaus Barbie, according to some accounts.After de Gaulle was elected president in 1958, he sought to purge the Frenchgovernment of its CIA-connected elements. Dulles had made heavy inroads intoFrance’s political, cultural, and intelligence circles in the postwar years.According to some French reports, during his visits to Paris the spymaster wouldset himself up at a suite in the Ritz Hotel, where he would dispense bags fullof cash to friendly politicians, journalists, and other influential figures.Some were wined and dined and enticed with beautiful Parisian call girls.De Gaulle was particularly determined to shut down the secret “stay-behind army”that Dulles had organized in France—a network of anti-Communist militants withaccess to buried arms caches who were originally recruited to resist a potentialSoviet invasion but were now aligned with the rebellious generals and othergroups plotting to overthrow French democracy. De Gaulle ordered his youngsecurity adviser, Constantin Melnik, to shut down the murky, stay-behind networkof fascists, spooks, and criminals, which Melnik agreed was “very dangerous forthe security of France.” But Melnik, who was trained at the RAND Corporation, aleading think tank for the U.S. national security complex, was another admirerof Dulles, and the stay-behind underground continued to operate in France.Melnik—who was the son of a White Russian general and the grandson of CzarNicolas II’s personal physician, who was executed along with the imperialfamily—was as passionately anti-Soviet as his U.S. security colleagues.In May 1958, when de Gaulle returned to power in Paris after a twelve-yearabsence, Dulles flew to Paris for a face-to-face meeting with the legendaryFrenchman to see if their differences could be resolved. Dulles had greatconfidence in his personal powers of persuasion. But the proud de Gaulle refusedto see the spymaster, handing him off to one of his close associates, MichelDebré. A formal dinner was organized for Dulles and Jim Hunt, the CIA stationchief in Paris, which was also attended by Melnik. Dulles seemed unfazed by deGaulle’s slight. But, as French journalist Frédéric Charpier later commented,“Upon returning to the Ritz Hotel, Dulles drew some lessons from the evening,which confirmed his fears. De Gaulle promised to be a tough and hostile partnerwho was sure to put an end to the laissez-faire attitude which up until then hadcharacterized the [French government].”World leaders defied Allen Dulles at their peril—even leaders like Charles deGaulle, whose nation’s warm, fraternal relations with the United States datedback to the American Revolution. After Dulles flew home to Washington, the CIA’sreports on de Gaulle took a sharper edge. At a National Security Council meetingconvened by Eisenhower in September 1958, gloomy prognostications were madeabout the French leader’s ability to settle the Algerian crisis to America’ssatisfaction. The possibility of overthrowing de Gaulle and replacing him withsomeone more in tune with U.S. interests was openly discussed, but the idea wasdiscarded at that point as too risky.However, by the time Kennedy took office in January 1961, the CIA was primed fora power switch in Paris. On January 26, Dulles sent a report to the newpresident on the French situation that seemed to be preparing Kennedy for deGaulle’s imminent elimination, without giving any hint of the CIA’s owninvolvement in the plot. “A pre-revolutionary atmosphere reigns in France,”Dulles informed JFK. “The Army and the Air Force are staunchly opposed to deGaulle,” the spymaster continued, exaggerating the extent of the militaryopposition, as if to present the demise of the French president as a faitaccompli. “At least 80 percent of the officers are violently against him. Theyhaven’t forgotten that in 1958, he had given his word of honor that he wouldnever abandon Algeria. He is now reneging on his promise, and they hate him forthat. De Gaulle surely won’t last if he tries to let go of Algeria. Everythingwill probably be over for him by the end of the year—he will be either deposedor assassinated.” Dulles clearly knew much more, but he wasn’t sharing it withKennedy.When the coup against de Gaulle began three months later, Kennedy was still inthe dark. It was a tumultuous time for the young administration. As he continuedto wrestle with fallout from the Bay of Pigs crisis, JFK was suddenly besiegedwith howls of outrage from a major ally, accusing his own security services ofseditious activity. It was a stinging embarrassment for the new Americanpresident, who was scheduled to fly to Paris for a state visit the followingmonth. To add to the insult, the coup had been triggered by de Gaulle’s effortsto bring French colonial rule in Algeria to an end—a goal that JFK himself hadardently championed. The CIA’s support for the coup was one more defiant displayof contempt—a back of the hand aimed not only at de Gaulle but at Kennedy.JFK took pains to assure Paris that he strongly supported de Gaulle’spresidency, phoning Hervé Alphand, the French ambassador in Washington, todirectly communicate these assurances. But, according to Alphand, Kennedy’sdisavowal of official U.S. involvement in the coup came with a disturbingaddendum—the American president could not vouch for his own intelligence agency.Kennedy told Alphand that “the CIA is such a vast and poorly controlled machinethat the most unlikely maneuvers might be true.”This admission of presidential impotence, which Alphand reported to Paris, was astartling moment in U.S. foreign relations, though it remains largely unknowntoday. Kennedy then underlined how deeply estranged he was from his own securitymachinery by taking the extraordinary step of asking Alphand for the Frenchgovernment’s help to track down the U.S. officials behind the coup, promising tofully punish them. “[Kennedy] would be quite ready to take all necessarymeasures in the interest of good Franco-American relations, whatever the rank orfunctions of [the] incriminated people,” Alphand cabled French foreign ministerMaurice Couve de Murville.To solidify his support for de Gaulle, Kennedy ordered U.S. ambassador JamesGavin to offer the French leader “any help” he might need—clearly indicatingthat U.S. troops would even fire on rebel forces from Algeria if they tried toland at American military bases in France. De Gaulle proudly declined the offeras “well-intentioned, but inappropriate”—perhaps horrified at the prospect ofAmerican GIs killing French soldiers on his nation’s soil. But Kennedy didarrange for U.S. base commanders to take steps to camouflage landing sites, incase rebel planes attempted to use them.In the wake of the crises in Cuba and France provoked by his own securityofficials, Kennedy began to display a new boldness. JFK’s assertivenesssurprised CIA officials, who had apparently counted on Kennedy to be sidelinedduring the French coup. Agency officials assured coup leaders that the presidentwould be too “absorbed in the Cuban affair” to act decisively against the plot.But JFK did react quickly to the French crisis, putting on high alert AmbassadorGavin, a decorated paratrooper commander in World War II who could be counted onto keep NATO forces in line. The president also dispatched his French-speakingpress spokesman, Pierre Salinger, to Paris to communicate directly with ÉlyséePalace officials.As Paris officials knew, the new American president already had something of aprickly relationship with de Gaulle, but he had strong feelings for France—andthey made sure to absolve JFK of personal responsibility for the coup in theirleaks to the press. French press accounts referred to the CIA as a “reactionarystate-within-a-state” that operated outside of Kennedy’s control.After JFK’s death, Alphand spoke fondly of the bonds between Kennedy and France.“He thought that harmonious relations between the U.S. and France were afundamental element of world equilibrium. He knew France as a boy. He came toFrance for his holidays—the south of France—and he knew France also through hiswife. Jacqueline made many, many trips to Paris. I know that Jacqueline helpedhim very much to understand France. She loves France—she has French blood—shespeaks our language very well and she asked him to read the memoirs of Generalde Gaulle.”Kennedy’s strong show of support for de Gaulle undoubtedly helped fortify Frenchresolve against the rebellious generals. In the midst of the crisis, theAmerican president issued a public message to de Gaulle, telling him, “In thisgrave hour for France, I want you to know of my continuing friendship andsupport as well as that of the American people.” But it was de Gaulle himself,and the French people, who turned the tide against the coup.By Sunday, the second day of the coup, a dark foreboding had settled over Paris.“I am surprised that you are still alive,” the president of France’s NationalAssembly bluntly told de Gaulle that morning. “If I were Challe, I would havealready swooped down on Paris; the army here will move out of the way ratherthan shoot. . . . If I were in the position Challe put himself in, as soon as Iburst in, I would have you executed with a bullet in the back, here in thestairwell, and say you were trying to flee.” De Gaulle himself realized that ifChalle did airlift his troops from Algiers to France, “there was not much tostop them.”But at eight o’clock that evening, a defiant de Gaulle went on the air, asnearly all of France gathered around the TV, and rallied his nation with themost inspiring address of his long public career. He looked exhausted, with darkcircles under his eyes. But he had put on his soldier’s uniform for theoccasion, and his voice was full of passion. De Gaulle began by denouncing therebellious generals. The nation had been betrayed “by men whose duty, honor andraison d’être it was to serve and to obey.” Now it was the duty of every Frenchcitizen to protect the nation from these military traitors. “In the name ofFrance,” de Gaulle shouted, thumping the table in front of him, “I order thatall means—I repeat all means—be employed to block the road everywhere to thosemen!”De Gaulle’s final words were a battle cry. “Françaises, Français! Aidez-moi!”And all over France, millions of people did rush to the aid of their nation. Thefollowing day, a general strike was organized to protest the putsch. Ledprimarily by the left, including labor unions and the Communist Party, the massprotest won broad political support. Over ten million people joined thenationwide demonstrations, with hundreds of thousands marching in the streets ofParis, carrying banners proclaiming “Peace in Algeria” and shouting, “Fascismwill not pass!” Even police officers associations expressed “completesolidarity” with the protests, as did the Roman Catholic Confederation, whichdenounced the “criminal acts” of the coup leaders, warning that they “threatento plunge the country into civil war.”Hundreds of people rushed to the nation’s airfields and prepared to block therunways with their vehicles if Challe’s planes tried to land. Others gatheredoutside government ministries in Paris to guard them against attack. AndréMalraux, the great novelist turned minister of culture, threaded his way throughone such crowd, handing out helmets and uniforms. Meanwhile, at the huge Renaultfactory on the outskirts of Paris, workers took control of the sprawling complexand formed militias, demanding weapons from the government so that they couldfend off rebel assaults.“In many ways, France, and particularly Paris, relived its great revolutionarypast Sunday night and Monday—the past of the revolutionary barricades, ofvigilance committees and of workers’ councils,” reported The New York Times.De Gaulle’s ringing address to the nation and the massive public response had asobering effect on the French military. Challe’s support quickly began meltingaway, even—humiliatingly—within the ranks of his own military branch, the airforce. Pilots flew their planes out of Algeria, and others feigned mechanicaltroubles, depriving Challe’s troops of the air transport they needed to descendon Paris.Meanwhile, de Gaulle moved quickly to arrest military officers in France whowere involved in the coup. Police swooped down on the Paris apartment of an armycaptain who was plotting pro-putsch street riots, and de Gaulle’s minister ofthe interior seized the general in charge of the rebel forces that were gatheredin the forests outside Paris. Deprived of their leader, the insurrectionaryunits sheepishly began to disperse.By Tuesday night, Challe knew that the coup had failed. The next day, hesurrendered and was flown to Paris. Challe emerged from the plane “carrying hisown suitcase, looking crumpled and insignificant in civilian clothes,” accordingto Time. “He stumbled at the foot of the landing steps, [falling] heavily on hishands and knees.” It was an ignominious homecoming for the man who had fullybelieved that, with U.S. support, he was to replace the great de Gaulle. Challeexpected to face a firing squad, but de Gaulle’s military tribunal provedsurprisingly merciful, sentencing the fifty-five-year-old general to fifteenyears in prison.After the failed coup, de Gaulle launched a new purge of his security forces. Heousted General Paul Grossin, the powerful chief of SDECE, the French secretservice, and he shut down its armed unit, the 11th Choc (Shock Battalion), whichhe suspected of being a breeding ground for the coup. Grossin, who was closelyaligned with the CIA, had told Frank Wisner over lunch that the return of deGaulle to power was equivalent to the Communists taking over in Paris.The 11th Choc had grown into a dangerously unhinged killing unit, targetingrepresentatives of the Algerian independence movement and their Europeansupporters, even on the streets of France. Those branded enemies of the Frenchempire were gunned down, blown up, or poisoned by SDECE’s action arm. Aided byex-Nazi agents of Reinhard Gehlen’s organization, the 11th Choc’s assassinationcampaign reached the point where “liquidations [were] an almost daily routine,”according to Philippe Thyraud de Vosjoli, a veteran SDECE agent who served asthe liaison to the CIA.Shortly after pushing out Grossin, de Gaulle also jettisoned his securityadviser, Constantin Melnik, Dulles’s close ally. Late into his life, Melnikcontinued to insist that the CIA was always a friend to de Gaulle—which wouldhave come as a surprise to the French president. Writing in his 1999 memoir,Politically Incorrect, Melnik flatly declared, “I can testify that . . . despitesuspicious yelping by Gaullist camp followers . . . the CIA always was afaithful ally of General de Gaulle, even of his often torturous Algerianpolicies.” After de Gaulle dumped Melnik, Dulles—who by then had also beenfired—immediately offered to hire him for a new private intelligence agency hewas planning in the Third World. But Melnik declined, instead pursuing a careerin French publishing and politics.For the rest of his ten-year presidency, which ended with his retirement frompolitics in 1969, de Gaulle continued to take strong countermeasures againstforces he regarded as seditious threats. In 1962, he expelled CIA station chiefAlfred Ulmer, a gung ho veteran of Dulles’s Cold War battlegrounds. In 1967, deGaulle evicted NATO from France to regain “full sovereignty [over] Frenchterritory” after discovering that the military alliance was encouraging WesternEuropean secret services to interfere in France’s domestic politics.Following the Algiers putsch, de Gaulle remained an assassinationtarget—particularly during the explosive months before and after he finallyrecognized Algerian independence in July 1962. The most dramatic attempt on hislife was staged the next month by the OAS—an ambush made famous in the FrederickForsyth novel and movie The Day of the Jackal. As de Gaulle’s black Citroën spedalong the Avenue de la Libération in Paris, with the president and his wife inthe rear seat, a dozen OAS snipers opened fire on the vehicle. Two of thepresident’s motorcycle bodyguards were killed—and the bullet-riddled Citroënskidded sharply. But de Gaulle was fortunate to have a skilled and loyalsecurity team, and his chauffeur was able to pull the car out of its spin andspeed to safety, despite all four tires’ being shot out. The president and hiswife, who kept their heads down throughout the fusillade, escaped unharmed.The French president demonstrated that he was willing to fight fire with fire.According to de Vosjoli, de Gaulle loyalists in SDECE even recruited their ownsecret assassins—including a particularly violent group of Vietnamese exiles—whoblew up cafés in Algeria frequented by enemies of de Gaulle and kidnapped,tortured, and murdered other OAS combatants deemed a threat to the president.Democracy in France in the early 1960s was sustained as the result of a viciousunderground war that the old French general was willing to fight with equalferocity.Because of the severe security measures he took, Charles de Gaulle survived histumultuous presidency. He died of a heart attack the year after he left office,just short of his eightieth birthday, slumping over quietly in his armchairafter watching the evening news.President Kennedy met only once with de Gaulle, on his state visit to Paris atthe end of May 1961, a month after the failed coup. The president and First Ladywere feted at a banquet in Élysée Palace, where the old general—dazzled byJackie—leaned down closely to hear every breathy word she spoke to him, influent French. During the three-day visit, the two heads of state discussed manypressing issues, from Laos to Berlin to Cuba. But Kennedy and de Gaulle neverbroached the touchy subject of the coup, much less the CIA’s involvement in it.As French journalist Vincent Jauvert later observed, “Why wake up old demons whohad barely fallen asleep?”Kennedy knew that he would have to resume wrestling with those demons as soon ashe returned home. He would have to decide how deeply to purge his own securityagencies, as de Gaulle had already begun to do in France. Kennedy knew therewould be steep political costs involved in taking on the CIA and Pentagon. But,as Walter Lippmann had told Schlesinger, “Kennedy will not begin to be Presidentuntil he starts to break with Eisenhower.” Continuity in Washington was nolonger the new president’s concern. Shaken by the traumatic events in Cuba andFrance, JFK was ready to remake his government.A few weeks after the Bay of Pigs and the foiled French coup, JFK asked Jackieto invite Dulles for drinks or tea at the White House. Charlie Wrightsman andhis wife were also dropping by, and Kennedy wanted to make a point. The Floridatycoon had self-righteously told Kennedy that he was not going to be seeing hisold friend Dulles during his trip to Washington—his way of snubbing thespymaster for bungling the job in Cuba. The president was “disgusted” byWrightsman’s disloyalty to Dulles, according to Jackie, so he went out of hisway to include the disgraced CIA leader in the White House’s get-together. Bynow, enough time had elapsed since the disasters of April, and with Dulles onhis way out, Kennedy was feeling magnanimous toward the Old Man.“[Jack] was so loyal always to people in, you know, trouble,” the First Ladylater recalled. “And he made a special effort to come back from [the OvalOffice] and sit around with Jayne and Charlie Wrightsman, just to show Charliewhat he thought of Allen Dulles. And, I mean, it made all the difference toAllen Dulles. I was with him about five [or ten] minutes before Jack got there.He just looked like, I don’t know, Cardinal Mindszenty on trial,” she said,referring to the Hungarian prelate who was sentenced to life in prison afterbeing found guilty of treason by a Soviet-run show trial. “You know, just ashell of what he was. And Jack came and talked—put his arm around him. . . .Well, wasn’t that nice? It was just to show Charlie Wrightsman. But it showssomething about Jack. I mean, he knew [that] Dulles had obviously botchedeverything up. [But], you know, he had a tenderness for the man.”But “poor Allen Dulles,” as Jackie took to referring to him, was likelyuntouched by the president’s gesture. The CIA director’s resentment of Kennedywas growing by the day, as his fingers slowly lost their grip on power. Feelingthe young man’s arm wrapped paternally around his shoulder would have chilledDulles, not warmed him. The spymaster had served every president since WoodrowWilson. And now, here he was, being comforted by this weak pretty boy who didnot belong in the same company as the great men who preceded him. It wasappalling that he, Allen Dulles, should be consoled by such a man.Though Dulles himself kept his fury carefully concealed, his most loyal aidesand political allies freely vented their feelings against the Kennedy WhiteHouse on the Old Man’s behalf. Howard Hunt, who worked as the CIA’s politicalliaison with the volatile Cuban exile community on the Bay of Pigs, calledDulles and Bissell “scapegoats to expiate administration guilt.” Hunt, whoseanti-Communist passions equaled those of his militant Cuban compadres, wasdeeply moved by the way his boss comported himself during his slow fadeout atthe CIA. “As a member of Dulles’s staff,” Hunt remembered, “I lunched in theDirector’s mess, seeing him return from each [Taylor] Committee session moredrawn and gray. But on taking his place at the head of the table, Mr. Dulles’sdemeanor changed into hearty cheerfulness—a joke here, a baseball bet there,came from this remarkable man whose long career of government service had beendestroyed unjustly by men who were laboring unceasingly to preserve their ownpublic images.”The summer following the Bay of Pigs, Prescott Bush—the CIA’s man in theSenate—and his wife, Dorothy, invited Dulles to dinner at their Washington home.The spymaster showed up with John McCone in tow—the Republican businessman andformer Atomic Energy Commission chairman Kennedy had just privately tapped asDulles’s replacement. Bush, who was still unaware that Dulles had beenofficially deposed, was surprised to see McCone, “whom,” he later recalled in aletter to Clover, “we had not thought of as a particular friend of Allen’s. ButAllen broke the ice promptly, and said that he wanted us to meet his successor.The announcement came the next day.” The dinner conversation around the Bushfamily table that night was awkward. “We tried to make a pleasant evening ofit,” Bush wrote, “but I was rather sick at heart, and angry too, for it was theKennedy’s [sic] that brot [sic] about the fiasco. And here they were makingAllen seem to be the goat, which he wasn’t and did not deserve. I have neverforgiven them.”On November 28, 1961, Dulles was given his formal send-off at the CIA, in aceremony held at the agency’s brand-new headquarters, a vast, modernist complexcarved out of the woods in Langley, Virginia. It was a day of clashing emotionsfor Dulles. The gleaming new puzzle palace, which Dulles had commissioned, wasseen by many as a monument to his long reign—but he would never occupy thedirector’s suite. Now some agency wits were snidely christening the Langleyedifice “The Allen Dulles Memorial Mausoleum.”President Kennedy was gracious in his farewell remarks, as he bestowed theagency’s highest honor—the National Security Medal—on Dulles. “I regard AllenDulles as an almost unique figure in our country,” he told the crowd gathered ina sterile, fluorescent-lit theater, including a somber-faced Clover and EleanorDulles, and an equally stern-looking General Lemnitzer and J. Edgar Hoover, whoalmost certainly were wondering when they would be next to go. “I know of noman,” the president continued, “who brings a greater sense of personalcommitment to his work—who has less pride in office—than he has.”This last piece of flattery was particularly overblown, as Kennedy well knew,because there were few men in his administration brimming with as muchself-admiration as Allen Dulles. The departing CIA director had made sure thatinvitations to his medal ceremony were sent out to a who’s who list of Fortune500 executives, including the chiefs of General Electric, General Motors, Ford,DuPont, Coca-Cola, Chase Manhattan, U.S. Steel, Standard Oil, IBM, CBS, andTime-Life. He kept copies of all the flowery farewells that poured in from thecorporate world, including letters from 20th Century Fox movie mogul SpyrosSkouras, and conglomerate tycoon J. Peter Grace, who wrote, “It is almostunbelievable that one family could produce two men of the caliber of yours andyour late, sorely missed, brother.”But, after the ceremony, Dulles looked a bit lost and forlorn as he waved toKennedy’s departing helicopter from the front steps of the headquarters he wouldnever occupy. The following day was even more melancholy for Dulles as JFK sworein McCone at the old CIA building on E Street. Clover dropped him off at theceremony in the family car, since Dulles was no longer entitled to a CIAlimousine and driver. “Clover, I’ll be home later in a taxi,” the Old Man toldhis wife as he climbed out of the car. He was overheard by Lawrence “Red” White,the agency’s efficient, nuts-and-bolts administrator, who insisted that Dullesbe driven home in an official car. Dulles made a show of protesting but acceptedthe kind gesture—one of the few bright spots in what colleagues described as avery dark day for the espionage legend. “His morale,” White recalled, “waspretty low on his last day as DCI [Director of Central Intelligence].”Retired at home in Georgetown, the old spymaster’s funereal mood did not lift asKennedy proceeded to rid his administration of remnants of the fallen Dullesdynasty. First to go were the Dulles deputies most closely associated with theBay of Pigs, Dick Bissell and Charles Cabell. Then Attorney General BobbyKennedy, his brother’s vigilant watchman, tracked down Eleanor Dulles, who wasstill working quietly on German affairs in Foggy Bottom, and had Secretary ofState Rusk fire her. “I don’t want any more of the Dulles family around,” theattorney general was heard to say. Eleanor took it hard. “It was silly, Isuppose,” she later remarked. “I was 66 years old, and a lot of my friends askedwhy I should want to go on working. Well, I had psychological and financialreasons. My job at State was a valuable thing to cling to. Besides, I had debts.I had put two children through college, and I needed a salary.”Over at the Pentagon, JFK had already begun to purge Dulles Cold Warriors likeArleigh Burke, who was drummed out of the Navy in August. Next to go wasLemnitzer, who was replaced as Joint Chiefs chairman by Maxwell Taylor inNovember, the same month Dulles himself was shown the door.Kennedy took further steps to signal that the Dulles era was over and that theCIA would no longer be allowed to run wild; he placed overseas agents under thecontrol of U.S. ambassadors and shifted responsibility for future paramilitaryoperations like the Bay of Pigs to the Pentagon. It was the Kennedy brothers,not the Dulles brothers, who now ran Washington.Dulles found it hard to adjust to life on the political sidelines. “He had avery difficult time to decompress,” said Jim Angleton, his longtime acolyte. Butit soon became clear that the Dulles dynasty was not entirely dismantled.In truth, the Kennedy purge had left the ranks of Dulles loyalists at the CIAlargely untouched. Top Dulles men like Angleton and Helms remained on the job.And the Old Man’s shadow knights never abandoned their king. They continued tocall on him in Georgetown, with Angleton visiting two or three times a week.They consulted with him on agency affairs, as if he were still DCI, and not JohnMcCone. They collaborated with him on plans for books and film projects. Theycontinued to kneel before Allen Dulles, their banished commander, and kiss hisring. And soon, Dulles began to emerge from his gloomy refuge, ready for action.By mid-January 1962, the “retired” spymaster was writing an old comrade, “As youknow, I am not much of a believer in either retirement or long vacations.” Thehouse on Q Street was already on its way to becoming the seat of a government inexile. Dulles had been deposed, but his reign continued."},{"pageContent":"16 [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-38]ROME ON THE POTOMAC [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-38]By the evening of June 16, 1962, when bow-tied Arthur Schlesinger Jr. wenttumbling fully clothed into the swimming pool at Hickory Hill, Robert and EthelKennedy’s estate in suburban Virginia, the dunking of party guests had become aNew Frontier ritual. Dinner parties at Hickory Hill, where dogs and children ranwild through the house and across the rolling lawns, were already a colorfulpart of Washington society lore. Invitations to Bobby and Ethel’s backyard festssignaled insider status in the youthful Kennedy court. Judy Garland sang; HarryBelafonte did the twist; national heroes like astronaut John Glenn faced bold,new challenges. On this particular evening, Glenn, who had recently become thefirst American to orbit the earth, was dared by the rambunctious Ethel to sitwith her at dinner—on a plank that had been laid precariously across the pool.The astronaut succeeded in staying dry, but Ethel ended up in the pool whenSchlesinger and another guest began mischievously bouncing up and down on thewobbly board. Later, as Schlesinger chivalrously leaned down to help Ethel outof the water, a prankster bumped him and the respected Harvard historian wentheadlong into the pool, taking the attorney general’s wife down with him.The raucous antics of the Kennedy crowd were greeted by much of the Washingtonestablishment as a welcome relief from the fusty Eisenhower regime. The Kennedybrothers and their team brought such relentless vigor to their jobs, they wereallowed to blow off steam in their off-hours. There had been no scolding in thepress, for instance, the year before when Senator Edward M. Kennedy, thepresident’s fun-loving baby brother, had emerged from his own swimming poolbaptism at Hickory Hill, “a huge, dripping mass in a now hopelessly rumpleddinner jacket,” as Schlesinger recalled.But by June 1962, the Kennedy administration was deeply embattled, from withinand without. And the Kennedy circle’s unrestrained merrymaking now was regardedas unseemly in some quarters. Drew Pearson noted in his column that “Southerncongressmen were especially interested in the fact that Ethel Kennedy,sister-in-law of the president, twisted with Harry Belafonte, well-known Negrosinger.” Meanwhile, Schlesinger’s swimming pool high jinks were splashed acrossthe front page of the anti-Kennedy New York Herald Tribune. As JFK’s main linkto the liberal intelligentsia and left wing of the Democratic Party, the WhiteHouse adviser had become an especially tempting political target.Henry J. Taylor, a syndicated newspaper columnist, led the press campaignagainst Schlesinger, taking advantage of the embarrassing publicity over hisHickory Hill water sports to level other charges against Kennedy’s courtphilosopher. Taylor accused Schlesinger of violating the White House code ofethics by moonlighting as a freelance writer, churning out political essays forpublications like The New York Times and The Saturday Evening Post, and doingmovie reviews for a chic new glossy magazine called Show.It turned out that the White House had no such ban against outside freelancingand that Kennedy, an ardent movie lover, thoroughly enjoyed Schlesinger’sreviews. One night, when Roger Vadim’s arty vampire movie Blood and Roses wasbeing screened in the White House projection room, a bored Kennedy got uphalfway through the feature and told Schlesinger he would be content to read hisreview. Before he left, the president shared some of his own rathersophisticated movie opinions with Schlesinger, urging him to do a comparativereview of the Italian film Girl with a Suitcase and A Cold Wind in August, anobscure independent feature. He then declared his disappointment with Breakfastat Tiffany’s and expressed his regret “that Hollywood had no guts any longer andcould not do a sharp or interesting film.”Taylor’s attack on Schlesinger—in which he warned of the liberal historian’spernicious influence on Kennedy policy—spread to other media outlets, includingTime magazine, which poked fun at Schlesinger’s Hickory Hill frivolity and,taking the opposite tack from Taylor, questioned whether he really did much ofanything as “special assistant” to President Kennedy. Thomas “Tommy the Cork”Corcoran, FDR’s legendary adviser and a longtime Washington power broker, didn’tlike the beating that Schlesinger was getting in the press and he phoned hisyoung friend at the White House. “I scent a manhunt,” Corcoran told Schlesinger.“The play they gave to the swimming pool story was the tip-off. They are out toget you.” The Cork warned Schlesinger that he had heard Republicans werespreading a vicious story that they had found someone claiming to be an oldHarvard classmate of Schlesinger, and “he will swear that he knew you then as amember of the Communist Party.”In the midst of the media furor, Schlesinger felt tempted to offer Kennedy hisresignation. Late one afternoon, when Schlesinger went to see the president inthe Oval Office on another matter, JFK asked him how he was holding up. “It’sbeen a bad couple of days,” he told Kennedy. The president responded in a“kindly way,” Schlesinger noted in his journal. “Don’t worry about it,” JFK toldhis downcast adviser. “Everyone knows that Henry Taylor is a jerk. All they aredoing is shooting at me through you.”The media attack on Schlesinger bore the fingerprints of the Dulles group.Though he’d been out of office for half a year, Dulles’s influence remainedstrong in the press—particularly with Luce publications like Time. Henry Taylor,too, had ties to the Dulles brothers, having served in Foster’s diplomatic corpsas ambassador to Switzerland before becoming a syndicated columnist for UnitedFeatures.On first glance, Schlesinger seemed like an unlikely target for the Dullesnetwork, since he, too, had enjoyed a friendly relationship with theintelligence chief, dating back to World War II, when the young historian wasone of many intellectuals recruited by the OSS. As an OSS analyst stationed inLondon and Paris during the war, Schlesinger held strongly anti-Communist views;after the war, Schlesinger became a leading architect of Cold War liberalism,joining the anti-Soviet propaganda campaign that was secretly funded by the CIAand endorsing efforts to root out Communist Party influence in the labormovement, cultural arena, and academic circles.Schlesinger was a passionate believer in New Deal liberalism, which he saw asthe only way to civilize capitalism. And he was an equally ardentanti-Communist, viewing the anti-Red crusade as a way to protect the Americanleft, by ridding it of the Stalinist contamination that had seeped intoDemocratic Party circles during FDR’s necessary wartime alliance with Moscow.Schlesinger believed that it was vital to purge these Communist Partyinfluences, even though the CP’s well-organized shock troops were behind many ofthe political and labor victories of the New Deal period, in order to fend offattacks from the right that sought to label liberalism as a paler version ofMarxist-Leninism.In 1949, Schlesinger endorsed a crude effort by Luce’s Life magazine—which theyoung, Pulitzer Prize–winning historian sometimes wrote for—to develop ablacklist of celebrities that the magazine described as “Dupes and FellowTravelers” of the Communist Party. Along with the predictable stalwarts of theFar Left, Life listed such liberal luminaries as Albert Einstein, Arthur Miller,Norman Mailer, Aaron Copeland, and Leonard Bernstein. Schlesinger gave the Lifemagazine blacklist his stamp of approval, calling it “a convenient way ofchecking the more obvious Communist-controlled groups.”Though Schlesinger was an avid New Dealer, he was also a pampered product of theAmerican elite—the son of esteemed Harvard historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Sr.,a graduate of exclusive Phillips Exeter Academy at fifteen, a summa cum laudegraduate of Harvard at twenty, and, at twenty-seven, winner of the PulitzerPrize for his masterful work The Age of Jackson. Raised in the rarefiedintellectual atmosphere of Cambridge, where the likes of James Thurber, John DosPassos, H. L. Mencken, and Samuel Eliot Morison circulated through his familyhome, young Schlesinger “never stopped seeming like the brightest student in theclass,” as The New York Times observed.Critics like C. Wright Mills and revisionist historian William Appleman Williamscharged that Schlesinger—coddled by the East Coast establishment and subsidizedby CIA front groups—clung to a one-sided view of the Cold War, placing soleresponsibility for the tense, global standoff on Moscow. Russia was not merelyseeking a protective buffer when it took control of Eastern Europe following theepic destruction of World War II, Schlesinger insisted; in his view, the SovietUnion was a “messianic state” whose “ideology compelled a steady expansion ofCommunist power.” Even after the collapse of Stalin’s regime, Schlesinger saw nosignificant modification in this implacable Soviet expansionism.Not surprisingly, Schlesinger maintained friendly, if somewhat remote, relationswith Allen Dulles throughout the 1950s. The Cold War consensus that dominatedDemocratic as well as Republican circles made for unlikely alliances;Schlesinger counted a number of top CIA officials among his friends, includingHelms, Wisner, and Bissell, and he often joined them on the Georgetown cocktailcircuit. Washington Post publisher Philip Graham and columnist Joe Alsop hostedthe parties where the disparate Dulles and Kennedy entourages all intermingled.Schlesinger had his differences with the CIA crowd, going back to his OSS days.He had been offended by “the notion of American spooks” like Dulles and Wisner“cheerfully consorting with people like General Reinhard Gehlen. . . . There wassomething aesthetically displeasing about Americans plotting with Nazis, who hadrecently been killing us, against Russians, whose sacrifices had made the alliedvictory possible.” During the Eisenhower-Dulles years, Schlesinger found muchmore that was “aesthetically displeasing” about the Republican reign. “TheDulles brothers,” sniffed Schlesinger’s first wife, Marian, years later, “wereself-righteous and egomaniacal.” By the time Kennedy took office, MarianSchlesinger, a product of the same Cambridge background as her husband, regardedAllen Dulles as “passé.”But in the name of Cold War fraternity, Schlesinger was willing to make his ownpolitical compromises—even with men like Allen Dulles, whose Wall StreetRepublicanism and bullying foreign interventionism represented everything thehistorian opposed. Schlesinger made an effort to maintain cordial relations withthe CIA chief, keeping up a friendly correspondence with Dulles that lasted lateinto the Old Man’s life. Schlesinger wrote a favorable review of Germany’sUnderground, Dulles’s 1947 book on anti-Hitler wartime intrigues, which eliciteda warm thank-you note from the spook. Over dinner at Phil Graham’s house inMarch 1958, they discussed Doctor Zhivago, Boris Pasternak’s epic lament aboutthe fragility of love and the human spirit in the grinding machinery oftwentieth-century Russian history. CIA officials believed that the novel, whichhad been banned in the USSR, had “great propaganda value,” and they wereplanning to sneak copies into Pasternak’s homeland, though the author himselfcame to regret the political exploitation of his book.On November 29, 1961, as Dulles was ushered out the door at the CIA, Schlesingerwrote to him again, telling the spy chief that it had been a “privilege” to workwith him and urging him to write his memoirs: “You have had a fascinating life,and you owe it to your fellow countrymen to put it down on paper.” Dullesresponded warmly two weeks later, telling the historian that he was mulling overa couple of book ideas “and may seek your wise counsel.”Nobody in Washington was better positioned than Arthur Schlesinger Jr. toobserve the growing split in Kennedy’s government. He had played a leading rolein the formation of the Cold War consensus that had held together Washington’sopposing political camps. But that consensus began to shatter early in theKennedy presidency, and Schlesinger found himself maintaining a delicatebalancing act, with one foot on each side of the divide. In the months followingthe Bay of Pigs crisis, the cracks continued to lace their way through theadministration, as JFK resisted the belligerent advice from his nationalsecurity advisers and tried to maneuver his way around the minefields of Cuba,Laos, Berlin, and Vietnam. Kennedy drew more ire from his warlords—including menlike Lemnitzer and Air Force chief Curtis LeMay, whom JFK considered mentallyunbalanced—when he brusquely dismissed their persistent pleading for a nuclearconfrontation with the Soviet Union and instead pursued a test ban treaty aimedat slowing down the race toward doomsday.Following the Bay of Pigs, Schlesinger found his relations with the CIA crowdstrained, but he still was invited to their dinner parties, and his Langleyfriends—like Helms, Ray Cline, and Cord Meyer—continued to keep him apprised ofthe agency’s mood. Meanwhile, Kennedy, despite his occasional bemusement atSchlesinger’s ivory-tower liberalism, increasingly drew the historian into hisinner sanctum. Schlesinger earned points with JFK, not only by giving him thecorrect advice on the Bay of Pigs—“a great mistake’’—but by resisting thetemptation to crow about his wisdom to the press following the disaster, as someadministration officials had done.Kennedy soon began seeking the historian’s advice on everything from nuclearpolicy to the handling of prickly liberal critics like Alfred Kazin, whomKennedy sought to charm, on Schlesinger’s advice, by inviting him for lunch atthe White House in August 1961. Kennedy was nervous about meeting the formidableNew York intellectual, suggesting that Jackie be invited too—“she knows allthose obscure French writers.” When Kazin arrived at the White House, JFK was athis dazzling best, offering fascinating insights into everyone from Malraux toKhrushchev, but he still fell short with the scholar, who later described thepresident as “slick, cool and devoid of vision.” When Schlesinger reminded himthat left-wing intellectuals said the same thing about FDR, Kazin replied thathe was one of those who did. “And I still believe today that I was absolutelyright!” Kazin declared.Schlesinger, however, was the type of intellectual who saw nothing wrong aboutentering the inner circle of power to serve a Roosevelt or a Kennedy. He deridedthose cloistered academics who remained on the sidelines, speculating about thetwists and turns of history but never actually participating in their times. Inthe beginning of his presidency, Kennedy was a bit nervous about having abestselling historian on his White House staff. Coming across Schlesingerpounding away at his typewriter one day in his remote East Wing office, JFKsmiled, “Now Arthur, cut it out. When the time comes, I’ll write The Age ofKennedy.” But after the Bay of Pigs, feeling increasingly besieged within hisown administration, Kennedy embraced Schlesinger’s role as court chronicler. Thepresident encouraged Schlesinger to begin taking notes at White House meetings.“You can be damn sure that the CIA has its records and the Joint Chiefs theirs,”JFK told him. “We’d better make sure we have a record over here.”Schlesinger’s journal entries, letters, and memos provide a fascinating andinvaluable inside look at the increasingly acrimonious civil war that would tearapart Kennedy’s government. Critics often denounced Schlesinger as a toady topower, and there is no doubt that he fell under the spell of Camelot, sharingintimate weekends with the first couple at Hyannis Port and drinking champagnewith the Kennedys on board their sailboats off Cape Cod and on the Potomac.During the Bay of Pigs debacle, Schlesinger took a particularly strong blastfrom the left, with C. Wright Mills denouncing “Kennedy and company” for“return[ing] us to barbarism,” and singling out JFK’s in-house historian, whomMills charged had “disgraced us intellectually and morally.”But critics like Mills were not privy to the internal battles that raged withinthe Kennedy administration. In reality, Kennedy and trusted advisers likeSchlesinger were determined to check the forces of “barbarism,” not to succumbto them—and their efforts set off a powerful backlash within the president’s ownbureaucracy. The struggle fought between JFK and the national security elite, asKennedy attempted to lead the country out of the Cold War, was largely invisibleto the American people. Nor was it fully understood by observers like Mills, whodied of a heart attack at forty-five in March 1962, before the Kennedy courtdrama reached its violent climax. Schlesinger himself did not entirely grasp theforces at play as he recorded the daily turmoil of the Kennedy presidency. Butthe picture that clearly emerges from reading his insightful journals and memosdecades later is one of a government at war with itself.The relationship between Kennedy and Schlesinger took a back-and-forth course,as the two men began to reevaluate America’s Cold War policies. Sometimes it wasthe president whose thinking was boldest, other times it was his adviser whopushed Kennedy to be more courageous. The president’s subtle grasp ofU.S.-Soviet dynamics had the effect of making Schlesinger’s own Cold Warphilosophy less rigid and more sophisticated. By 1963, Kennedy would come to theconclusion that “the hardliners in the Soviet Union and the United States feedon one another”—an observation that struck Schlesinger as wise. Kennedy liked tosurround himself with intelligent men, but he was usually the most perceptiveman in the room. He had a way of raising the thinking of his “best andbrightest” to a higher level.When it came to domestic politics, JFK was a shrewd strategist, and he thrashedout decisions by reviewing them with longtime political confidants and warhorses, like his brother Bobby and special assistant Kenny O’Donnell. ButKennedy also realized that his political pragmatism could sometimes compromisehis vision. So he often relied on New Frontier true believers like Schlesingerto be his voices of conscience and liberal touchstones. At other times, JFK usedSchlesinger almost as a comic foil.One day, Schlesinger urged Kennedy to replace Dean Rusk, a bland mouthpiece ofCouncil on Foreign Relations conventional wisdom, with a more stimulatingsecretary of state. Kennedy glanced up at his adviser from a paper on his deskthat he was perusing. “That’s a great idea, Arthur,” he said. After Schlesingerleft his office, JFK turned to O’Donnell, who had been quietly taking in thebold pitch for revitalizing the State Department, and laughed. “Arthur has a lotof good ideas,” the president told O’Donnell.Schlesinger himself sometimes questioned his relevance within the Kennedyadministration. “I have the feeling that the president somewhat discounts myviews,” the White House aide wrote in his journal in September 1962, “primarilybecause he regards me as a claimant agency for standardized liberalism, partlyalso because he considers me to be, after all, an intellectual andinsufficiently practical and realistic.”But by 1963, the president himself was telling his brother and Phil Graham thathe was seriously considering replacing Rusk with Robert McNamara, who had provena smart and reliable ally in Kennedy’s battles with the Pentagon’s warlords.Arthur had a lot of good ideas, and though he was careful not to overstep hisbounds, he was unfailingly articulate and often persistent in the way heespoused them. His insights and suggestions had a way of working themselves intothe recesses of Kennedy’s mind. The president had been an avid reader of historysince he was a boy, and here on his staff was someone who could raise the bighistorical questions at the very moment that the administration was makinghistory. No wonder academic colleagues like Richard Rovere got somewhat carriedaway and compared Schlesinger’s role in the Kennedy White House to that ofVoltaire and Aristotle in the courts of Frederick and Alexander the Great. Noprominent intellectual had held such a post of freewheeling influence in U.S.presidential history.Schlesinger’s most intrepid moment in the Kennedy presidency would come afterthe Bay of Pigs, when he boldly schemed to bring the CIA under presidentialcontrol, which neither Truman nor Eisenhower had been able to do. It tookcourage for Schlesinger to confront his old friends at the spy agency, some ofwhom denounced him as a traitor. The battle to take charge of the CIA wouldbecome the most fateful drama of the Kennedy presidency.Schlesinger began lobbying Kennedy to play a big role in reorganizing the CIAeven before the smoke had cleared from the Cuba debacle. He wanted to make surethat the current tempest over the agency did not simply fade away, resultingonce again in a blue-ribbon oversight committee controlled by “Dulles stooges,”as he put it. In an April 21, 1961, memo to the president Schlesinger wrote, “Itis important, in my judgment, to take CIA away from the Club.” Schlesinger wasnot enthusiastic about Kennedy’s choice of General Taylor to oversee the WhiteHouse’s Bay of Pigs postmortem, regarding the general as “very pleasant [but] aman of limited interests and imagination.” Nor was Taylor the sort of crusadingofficial who would follow through on Kennedy’s angry impulse to “splinter theCIA into a thousand pieces.” The general, Schlesinger noted, “is quite cautiousand does not seem disposed toward drastic reorganization of the intelligenceservices.”But it was Schlesinger whom Kennedy tapped to develop an ambitious CIAreorganization plan, while Taylor was limited to the Bay of Pigs inquest. Thehistorian was able to convince JFK of his qualifications for the job, remindinghim, “I served in the OSS during the war, and I have been a CIA consultant for agood deal of the period since; so that, while I am far from a professional inthis field, I am a relatively experienced amateur.”Schlesinger threw himself into the CIA study with scholarly dedication, amassinga thick file that contained detailed critiques of the organization by Washingtonliberals like George McGovern and agency whistle-blowers, one of whom wrote,“The Central Intelligence Agency is sick.” Schlesinger also compiled disparagingessays and investigative features about the Dulles reign from the liberal press,including The Nation and The New Republic. These were not the sources typicallyused when the CIA was subjected to reviews by handpicked friends of Dulles.The White House adviser completed his memo for revamping the CIA on June 30. Heacknowledged that his proposal “implies a fairly drastic rearrangement of ourpresent intelligence set-up.” The basic problem with the CIA, as Schlesinger sawit, was that it was out of control. Under his plan, all future covert operationswould be closely supervised by a Joint Intelligence Board composed ofrepresentatives from the White House and State Department. In addition, the CIAwould be divided into two separate organizations: one for clandestine action,and one for the collection and analysis of intelligence. Furthermore, theagency’s name—a tainted reminder of the Dulles era—would be replaced by “someblameless title,” Schlesinger suggested, like the National Information Service.Kennedy had already made it clear that he was in strong favor of this lastrecommendation. If he couldn’t raze Dulles’s mausoleum to the ground, he wouldat least give it a new name.No stranger to Washington politicking, Schlesinger attempted to rally supportfor his plan before submitting it to the president, sending copies to Washingtonpower attorney Clark Clifford, veteran diplomat Chip Bohlen, and JFK’s trustedaide and speechwriter Ted Sorensen. By the time the final draft was sent toKennedy, it was a more complicated and unwieldy document than Schlesingeroriginally intended. When the Dulles forces, including Taylor himself and theCIA’s congressional allies, immediately mounted a stubborn resistance to the newplan, Kennedy realized that overhauling the U.S. intelligence complex was goingto be a much trickier political process than he had hoped. Taylor arguedforcefully against the Schlesinger plan, telling JFK “this is not the time forsurgery, so far as the CIA is concerned, that it would damage the morale of theemployees too much.” Taylor also opposed changing the agency’s name, for thesame reason.On the morning of July 15, Bobby took Schlesinger aside at the White House andtold him that the CIA reorganization was on hold until a replacement for Dulleswas found. Undismayed, Schlesinger leaped immediately into the hunt for a newdirector. The president had briefly considered Bobby for the job but realizedthat his abrasive younger brother would be too politically charged a selection.Besides, RFK was already beginning each morning by dropping by CIA headquartersin Langley on his way to work in Washington so that he could keep an eye on theagency for the president. JFK even raised the possibility of putting Schlesingerin Dulles’s chair. “I imagine that the president was joking,” Schlesinger notedsimply in his journal.Fowler Hamilton soon emerged as the leading candidate for the CIA post. Hamiltonhad solid credentials as a successful Wall Street lawyer, former prosecutor inFDR’s Justice Department, and a bombing analyst with the Army Air Force duringWorld War II. Schlesinger gave the choice his blessing, telling JFK thatHamilton was a “sober, intelligent, hard-headed lawyer” who “would do the jobwell.” But there was something about Hamilton that set off the Dullescrowd—perhaps it was simply because he was not one of them. Or it might havebeen connected to the fact that Hamilton had run the war frauds unit forPresident Roosevelt and knew too much about the Dulles brothers.In any case, CIA opposition to Hamilton was so strong that Kennedy decided toabandon him, selecting instead an Eisenhower administration fixture—former AECchairman, Republican counselor, and military industrialist John McCone.Now it was Schlesinger’s turn to erupt. Putting an Eisenhower retread in chargeof the CIA would be a disastrous move, he warned Kennedy. It would send thewrong signal at the exact moment when the agency needed to be turned upsidedown. “McCone, for all his administrative qualities, is a man of crude andundiscriminating political views (or to put it more precisely, politicalemotions),” Schlesinger told the president in a memo. “He sees the world interms of a set of emotion-charged stereotypes.” But Schlesinger failed to blockthe announcement of McCone’s appointment in September. Afterward, writing in hisjournal, Schlesinger tried to cheer himself up, but without much success. “Thepossibly consoling thought is that the President has a habit of designating‘liberals’ to do ‘conservative’ things, and vice versa. . . . I am sure JFKknows what he is doing, and possibly my concern here will turn out to be asunwarranted as my concern last December over the appointment of Doug Dillon [asTreasury secretary], but I doubt it.”In October, still puzzling over McCone’s selection, Schlesinger brought up thesubject again with Kennedy in the Oval Office. He asked the president if he knewMcCone well. Kennedy admitted that he was not very familiar with his newappointee, but he seemed undisturbed by the prospect of working with him.Kennedy then began to vent about his outgoing CIA chief. “He was very criticalof Dulles,” Schlesinger later noted, “and implied that, after Dulles, anyonewould do.”If Kennedy thought that he was getting, in McCone, a respectable Republicanfront man who would readily do his bidding at the CIA, he was sorelydisappointed. In May 1962, Schlesinger fell into conversation at a Frenchembassy party with his friend, banker-diplomat W. Averell Harriman, the oldDemocratic Party wise man who had served as FDR’s ambassador to Moscow and wasnow serving JFK as a globe-trotting ambassador at large. Harriman gaveSchlesinger an astringent evaluation of the new McCone regime, which he saw aslittle changed from the Dulles days. This was clear, Harriman confided, fromlooking at the policy maneuvers around Laos, the Southeast Asia sideshow inwhich Kennedy was determined not to get embroiled. JFK’s policy of neutralitywas being “systematically sabotaged by the military and the CIA,” Harrimanwarned. “McCone and the people in the CIA want the president to have a setback.They want to justify the [intervention] position CIA took five years ago. Theywant to prove that a neutral solution is impossible and that the only course isto turn Laos into an American bastion.”Harriman, a veteran of Washington infighting, then advised Schlesinger how theWhite House should handle the CIA and military seditionists in its midst.“General [George] Marshall once told me that, when you change a policy, you mustchange the men too. [The] CIA has the same men—on the desk and in the field—whowere responsible for the disasters of the past, and naturally they do things toprove they were right. Every big thing the CIA has tried in the Far East hasbeen catastrophic . . . and the men responsible for these catastrophes are stillthere.” Kennedy’s purge of the CIA, Harriman made clear, had not been sweepingenough.The president had lopped off the heads of the top three men at the CIA, butDulles’s loyal deputies—like Helms and Angleton—were still running the show atLangley. And McCone, a CIA outsider who largely shared the former regime’sviews, was more or less content to go along with the old Dulles policies.“McCone has no business in the New Frontier,” Harriman told Schlesinger in March1963. Dulles’s successor “doesn’t believe in the administration,” said Harriman,and “was full of mischievous ideas and projects.”Two years into McCone’s tenure as CIA director, syndicated newspaper columnistHenry Taylor published a surprisingly critical piece about the intelligenceagency, calling it a “sick elephant” and urging it to “quit stalking throughforeign political backrooms and . . . building its own empire.” A few dayslater, Dulles wrote his old colleague a letter, letting Taylor know that heviewed his column as a personal betrayal and as “a direct attack on me [since]most of what you say [about the agency] happened while I was Director.” Taylorquickly replied with a long, groveling telegram, pleading that nothing he hadwritten—or ever would write—was critical of the spy agency under Dulles’sleadership. “Certainly you must know that any attack on you by me isinconceivable. . . . No one has served this country with greater distinction,selflessness and success than you.” But Dulles made it clear to Taylor that hewas still running the show at the CIA, so any distinction the columnist tried todraw between his tenure and McCone’s was false. “Since my retirement,” Dullestold Taylor, “there have been few important policy changes, and I am wholly insupport of its new chief and of its recent work.”This is precisely what Schlesinger was afraid of when McCone took over the CIAin November 1961: that the Dulles era would continue undisturbed. That month, asKennedy’s special assistant contemplated the new administration’s progress, hecould not help falling into a glum mood. Recent conversations with liberalfriends and colleagues, he wrote in his journal, “made me face up to the factthat there is no such thing as the New Frontier. We came in last January after acampaign which promised the American people a new beginning [but] we have reallydone damn little in the way of bold, new initiatives. JFK has given marvelousspeeches, but they are almost too marvelous. The words kindle splendid hopes;but the reality remains as dismal as ever.”Schlesinger grew anxious whenever he began to sense that the old“Eisenhower-Dulles continuities” were “beginning to reassert themselves.” Heyearned for Kennedy to break free from the political past, to “ignore the wisdomof the Establishment and accept the implications of his own campaign and his owninstincts.” The liberal counselor’s wishes were soon to become true.By 1962, President Kennedy was challenging the bastions of American power onseveral fronts, including the corporate elite’s control of the economy. Thesteel industry crisis that erupted that spring laid bare the growing tensionsbetween JFK and the Fortune 500 circle. On April 6, after yearlong negotiationsbetween steel companies and unions—which involved the personal participation ofthe president himself—a deal was announced that prevented the rise of steelprices. The steel agreement—which was based on labor concessions that Kennedyadministration officials had helped wring from the unions—was a major victoryfor JFK. The three-way pact hammered out by industry, labor, and governmentensured stability throughout the economy, since rising prices in the coreindustry had been the biggest inflationary factor in the postwar period. “Everytime steel prices jump, your pocketbook jumps—with pain,” Estes Kefauver,chairman of the Senate antitrust and monopoly subcommittee, told Americanconsumers in 1959.But just four days after the Kennedy-engineered steel pact was signed, U.S.Steel chairman Roger Blough scheduled a meeting at the White House and stunnedthe president by informing him that he was going to announce a 3.5 percent priceincrease, effective at midnight—a move that would trigger price jumps at othersteel companies and send inflationary ripples throughout the economy.Kennedy was furious at Blough’s double cross, which he correctly saw as a directchallenge to his ability to manage the economy. “My father always told me thatall businessmen were sons of bitches,” said JFK at the height of the steelindustry crisis, “but I never believed it until now”—a remark that he was happyto have leaked to Newsweek.While the president saw Blough as a backstabber, Luce’s Fortune magazineregarded the steel mogul as a capitalist hero, declaring him a “businessstatesman” who was fighting not just for his own company but on behalf of theentire corporate sector by defying the president’s authority. Blough’s companyoccupied a central position in the country’s corporate pantheon, which wasreflected in the U.S. Steel board of directors. Blough himself was wellconnected within the power elite—including to Dulles, with whom he served inorganizations like the Council on Foreign Relations and the Lafayette FellowshipFoundation (part of the Ford Foundation).Kennedy understood that if Blough and the other colluding steel executivesprevailed, his leadership would be severely undermined, not only at home butabroad. He had staked his reputation with organized labor and American consumerson the deal—and now he was faced with “the most painfully embarrassingpredicament of his career,” in the view of his White House advisers. A steelindustry victory would make it clear to the entire world who ran America.Determined to protect his presidency, over the next three days JFK unleashed thefull powers of the federal government in an all-out effort to crush the steelindustry rebellion. Attorney General Bobby Kennedy announced a grand jury probeof steel price-fixing, which he followed by issuing subpoenas for the personaland corporate records of steel executives and by sending FBI agents to raidtheir offices. “We were going to go for broke: their expense accounts and wherethey’d been and what they were doing,” JFK’s brother and political enforcerlater recalled. “I picked up all their records and I told the FBI to interviewthem all—march into their offices the next day. We weren’t going to go slowly. .. . All of [the steel executives] were hit with meetings the next morning byagents.” Meanwhile, Robert McNamara’s Defense Department announced that it wasreviewing its steel purchasing practices, making it clear that it would favorcompanies that did not follow U.S. Steel’s price hike.Kennedy’s strong-arm tactics produced quick results. On April 12, Inland Steel—asmaller but still significant company—caved under the pressure, announcing thatit would not raise prices. Bethlehem Steel soon followed, and by the next dayU.S. Steel itself waved the white flag.In victory, JFK adopted a genial and magnanimous posture. Over dinner at theWhite House on May 3, Schlesinger asked Kennedy what he had said to Blough whenthe U.S. Steel chairman surrendered. “I told him that his men could keep theirhorses for the summer plowing,” smiled JFK.But the resentment from the steel showdown never faded away. Corporateexecutives continued to snipe at the president, spreading the word that hisadministration had destroyed “business confidence” by bringing the steelindustry to heel. Senator Barry Goldwater, the voice of the rising Republicanright, escalated the rhetoric, calling Kennedy’s bare-knuckled tactics againstthe steel barons “a display of naked political power never seen before in thisnation. . . . We have passed within the shadow of police-state methods.”Chatting with Schlesinger in the Oval Office on June 4, Kennedy said, “Iunderstand better every day why Roosevelt, who started out such a mild fellow,ended up so ferociously anti-business.” JFK vowed that he was not going toappease his big business critics by taking what O’Donnell described as “anass-kissing posture.” To counter the corporate assault on his presidency, saidKennedy, “[w]e have to put out the picture of a small group of men turningagainst the government and the economy because the government would notsurrender to them. That is the real issue.”Schlesinger discovered that some of the corporate sniping against the presidentcame from within his own administration. While dining at Joe Alsop’s in lateJuly, the watering hole where Schlesinger kept in touch with the CIA crowd, theWhite House adviser was disgusted to hear McCone fulminate against Kennedy’seconomic policy, which the former industrialist regarded as too pro-labor. “Ihave rarely seen a man more completely out of sympathy” with theadministration’s economic direction, Schlesinger observed in his journal. TheCIA director’s “formula for economic stimulus,” wrote Schlesinger, “is to kicklabor in the teeth.”As he continued to wrestle with the disgruntled corporate community into thefall, Kennedy longed to make the battle over the economy the centerpiece of hispresidency, telling Schlesinger that he “only wished there were no Cold War sohe could debate the future of America with the businessmen.” This is aremarkable and all but overlooked statement, indicating—once again—Kennedy’svisionary thinking.A year after the April 1962 steel blowup, Kennedy tried to make light of thecontroversy as he addressed a Democratic fund-raising dinner at the WaldorfAstoria hotel. Told that the steel industry was presenting former presidentEisenhower with its annual public service award in another banquet hall at thesame hotel, JFK grinned mischievously. “I was their man of the year last year,”he told the Democratic crowd. “They wanted to come down to the White House togive me their award, but the Secret Service wouldn’t let them do it.”Beset by the rising tensions in his government, Kennedy would bring up theawkward subject of assassination from time to time. In public, as on thisoccasion, he used it as a comedic device. But in private, with old friends likeRed Fay, he mused about it in a more somber vein.The climate of conflict surrounding the Kennedy presidency had a way of evokingthe grim topic. Outraged by the president’s strong stand against the steelindustry, Henry Luce invoked the fate of Julius Caesar in a harsh editorial inFortune, warning JFK that he should “beware the ides of April.” But Kennedynever backed down from his ongoing duel with the steel industry. In October1963, just weeks before his assassination, JFK’s Justice Department filedprice-fixing charges against U.S. Steel and other steel companies, based onBobby’s earlier grand jury probe of the industry. To the end of his life,Kennedy made it clear that there would be no “ass-kissing” for those corporatepowers that tried to undermine his presidency.After Dulles was ousted by JFK in late 1961, the Old Man’s crowd had quicklyclosed ranks around him. The Luces immediately offered Dulles succor, invitingClover and him to spend the New Year holiday at their winter home in Phoenix.Clare Boothe Luce often used the Arizona estate, with its cactus garden andmesmerizing view of Camelback Mountain, to recover from her own bouts ofmelancholy, dropping LSD with eccentric friends like Gerald Heard, a gayAnglo-Irish writer, devotee of Eastern mysticism, and psychedelic pioneer.Clover found the Luces’ desert refuge a soothing respite from the Washingtonvortex, but, as she wrote Mary Bancroft from Phoenix, she knew that Allen didn’tshare her sentiments: “I do feel an immense relief of burden by Shark’s beingout, which he himself doesn’t feel.”Dulles’s growing sense of resentment toward Kennedy was shared by the Luces, whohad known JFK since he was a young Navy ensign. Joe Kennedy had courted HenryLuce’s support for his son during the 1960 presidential race, dropping by themagazine mogul’s Fifth Avenue apartment for a lobster dinner on the final nightof the Democratic Convention, and afterward watching TV together as JFK acceptedhis party’s nomination. “It was a memorable moment in my life,” Luce recalled.“It’s quite a thing to sit with an old friend and watch his son accept thenomination for the president of the United States.”Luce was not the type to let sentiment cloud his political judgment, however,and he remained loyal to the Republican ticket. But Life magazine, hisinfluential flagship publication, gave Nixon a tepid endorsement, leaving thedoor open for Kennedy. Luce admired JFK’s intellect and cultural sophistication.But he questioned whether he would be a sufficiently aggressive foe ofCommunism. After finishing their lobster dinner that night, in fact, Luce hadwarned Joe Kennedy that he would not stand for it if JFK proved too much of acompromiser in the White House. “If he shows any signs of weakness in generaltoward the anti-Communist cause, or to put it more positively, any weakness indefending and advancing the cause of the free world, why then we’ll certainly beagainst him,” Luce told the Kennedy paterfamilias.The Luce honeymoon with the Kennedy administration had been short-lived. Afterthe Bay of Pigs, Luce’s coverage of the presidency turned increasingly negative.By the spring of 1963, JFK was so exasperated with the relentless drumbeat ofcriticism from the Time-Life headquarters in New York that he invited the Lucesto lunch at the White House to see if he could somehow sweeten the powercouple’s disposition. When the press lord launched into a lengthy diatribe onCuba, demanding that Kennedy invade the island, the president suggested thatLuce was a “warmonger” and the afternoon came to an unpleasant conclusion, withthe Luces marching out of the White House before dessert was served. Shortlyafterward, Luce convened a remarkable war council of his top editors atTime-Life, where he declared that if the Kennedy administration was not boldenough to overthrow Castro, his corporation would take on the task. Luce and hiswife were already funding raids on Cuba, with the quiet support of the CIA. NowLuce would escalate his crusade against the Castro regime, in direct defiance ofKennedy.Like the Time-Life building in Manhattan, Dulles’s brick house on Q Street was aboiling center of anti-Kennedy opposition. The actively “retired” spymastermaintained a busy appointments calendar, meeting not only with retired CIA oldboys like Frank Wisner and Charles Cabell, but with a steady stream of top-rank,active-duty agency officials such as Angleton, Helms, Cord Meyer, and DesmondFitzgerald. More surprisingly, Dulles also conferred with midlevel officials andoperational officers such as Howard Hunt, James Hunt (a key deputy of Angleton,and no relation to Howard), and Thomas Karamessines (Helms’s right-hand man).McCone, too, routinely checked in with his predecessor, dining with him andsending him cordial notes.Though Howard Hunt did not occupy the same social strata as Dulles, the two menwere bonded in bitterness: they both felt they had been made scapegoats forKennedy’s failure of nerve at the Bay of Pigs. The retired spymaster sent Hunthis photograph, and Hunt gave him a copy of his angry Cuba memoir. “I wrote thisbook as an antidote to the despondency that seized me in the wake of the Cubaproject,” Hunt explained in an August 1962 letter, “and I hope it may give yousome diversion now.” Serving Dulles, Hunt wrote in an earlier letter, was “anhonor I shall always cherish.”Fearing that his role in the Bay of Pigs fiasco would stall his CIA career underKennedy, Hunt sought Dulles’s help in starting a new career in the privatesecurity field. “It occurs to me that one of your many business contacts mighthave use for me abroad, particularly if something of my background were known,”Hunt wrote Dulles in August.Dulles, who told Helms, “I have always thought well of Hunt,” and that he was“disposed” to help him, agreed to get together with Hunt in September.Afterward, Hunt decided to stay in the CIA, while moonlighting as a ghostwriterfor Dulles. Hunt was a prolific author and had been churning out spy novelsunder various noms de plume since World War II. Dulles—who produced four booksin retirement, including a war memoir, an intelligence handbook, and two volumesof espionage adventures—also worked on his literary projects with a young formerCIA employee named Howard Roman, whose wife, Jane, was employed in Angleton’sdeeply submerged counterintelligence unit.The CIA continued to provide a variety of services large and small for theformer director, in addition to supplying him with ghostwriters and researchmaterials. Shef Edwards, the agency’s internal security chief, even stepped into help Dulles renew his District of Columbia driver’s license in early 1963 sothat he could keep cruising the streets of Washington in his aging 1955 Pontiacsedan. Amassing wealth and luxuries had never been important to Dulles, but hedid expect to be served and pampered, and the CIA continued to oblige him.Dulles also stayed in touch with his extensive network of friends and supportersin the U.S. military, who continued to invite him to speak at defense seminarsand to play golf on military bases. He lunched with his fellow Bay of Pigscasualty, Arleigh Burke, at the Metropolitan Club. After Kennedy forced him outof the Navy, Burke quickly found another perch in Washington’s far-flungnational security complex, becoming chairman of the newly created Center forStrategic Studies at Georgetown University (now the Center for Strategic andInternational Studies) that he cofounded with David Abshire, a platform he usedto publicly air his grievances with the Kennedy administration. Burke made darkallegations about the White House’s “dictatorial” tendencies, charging that hisGeorgetown offices were the target of a suspicious 1963 break-in.Rising Republican politicians also sought out the retired spy chief, including ayoung Illinois congressman named Donald Rumsfeld, who, decades later, wouldachieve notoriety for his own national security reign. Rumsfeld arranged forDulles to speak about the CIA and Cuba to the 88th Congressional Club in March1963, an event the ambitious congressman declared a “tremendous success.”Cuba remained the source of greatest friction within the Kennedy government. InOctober 1962, these tensions came close to exploding during the Cuban MissileCrisis, when virtually the entire national security circle around the presidenturged him to take aggressive actions that would have triggered a nuclearconflagration. JFK’s lonely stand—which was supported only by his brother andMcNamara within his inner council—was a virtuoso act of leadership. As the worldheld its breath, the president painstakingly worked out a face-saving deal withKhrushchev that convinced the Soviet premier to withdraw his nuclear missilesfrom the island.Kennedy achieved the compromise by agreeing to remove U.S. missiles from Turkey,which the Soviet Union found equally menacing. In fact, the president had beentrying to get the obsolete Jupiter missiles demobilized for over a year but hadbeen stymied by State Department foot-dragging—just one more example of theintransigence and insubordination that bedeviled his administration. JFK wasfurious when he learned that his original order to remove the Jupiter rocketsfrom Turkey had been ignored. “The President believed he was President, andthat, his wishes having been made clear, they would be followed and the missilesremoved,” Bobby Kennedy later wrote in Thirteen Days, his memoir about themissile crisis. The President believed he was President . . . it was a strikingturn of phrase, one that captured JFK’s uncertain grasp on the wheel of power.The searing experience of teetering on the nuclear edge had the effect ofcreating a survivors’ bond between Kennedy and Khrushchev. JFK came to respectthe Soviet leader’s earthy wisdom and his surprising eloquence on behalf ofpeace. “At the climax of events around Cuba, there began to be a smell ofburning in the air,” Khrushchev evocatively began a speech he gave a few weeksafter the missile crisis, in which he denounced the “militarists” who had soughta nuclear confrontation. Kennedy read aloud part of the speech to Schlesinger,adding, “Khrushchev certainly has some good writers!”The feelings of respect were mutual. The Soviet leader later said he came togreatly admire JFK during the missile crisis. “He didn’t let himself becomefrightened, nor did he become reckless,” Khrushchev commented. “He showed realwisdom and statesmanship when he turned his back on right-wing forces in theUnited States who were trying to goad him into taking military action in Cuba.”Kennedy’s sincerity in the quest for peace continued to impress Khrushchev thefollowing June, when the U.S. leader gave an electrifying oration at AmericanUniversity, in which he soundly rejected the bellicose assumptions of the ColdWar. The address, which would go down in history as the Peace Speech, carriedechoes of Khrushchev’s own heartfelt pleas to Kennedy at the height of the Cubancrisis, when he had told JFK that the Russian people were neither “barbarians”nor “lunatics” and they loved life as much as the American people. At AmericanUniversity, Kennedy invoked the same sentiments, in the poetic cadence ofspeechwriter Sorensen. “We all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe thesame air. We all cherish our children’s future. And we are all mortal.”JFK reinforced his pathbreaking speech by dispatching Averell Harriman to Moscowthe following month to hammer out a limited nuclear test ban treaty withKhrushchev—the first diplomatic breakthrough in the struggle to control theweapons race. When the triumphant Harriman returned home, his Georgetownneighbors poured into the street outside his brick town house on P Street tocelebrate his achievement. One young woman, who was carrying a baby in her arms,told the old diplomat, “I brought him because what you did in Moscow will makeit possible for him to look ahead to a full and happy life.” The crustymillionaire was touched by the effusive neighborhood welcome. Harriman toldSchlesinger that by picking him for the mission—instead of one of the usual ColdWar envoys—Kennedy had “persuaded Khrushchev that we really wanted an agreement”and were not simply “going through the motions.” Khrushchev had a fondness forHarriman, whom he called “my friend, the imperialist.”JFK once confided to his friend Bill Walton, “I am almost a ‘peace-at-any-price’president.” It was a wry reference to the insult that Barry Goldwater,positioning himself for the 1964 presidential race, had begun flinging atpolitical opponents he deemed insufficiently hawkish. By 1963, the military andespionage officials in Kennedy’s government were all too aware of theircommander in chief’s dedication to peace—a growing commitment to détente withthe Communist world that, in the minds of the national security high command,demonstrated JFK’s naïveté and weakness and put the country at risk. Theleadership ranks in the Pentagon and the CIA were convinced that the CubanMissile Crisis had been the ideal opportunity for Kennedy to finally knock outthe Castro regime by launching a full-scale military invasion or even a nuclearbroadside. The peaceful resolution of the crisis left Kennedy’s warriors in anugly mood. Daniel Ellsberg, who later became famous for leaking the PentagonPapers, observed the seething fury among uniformed officers when he was servingas a young defense analyst: “There was virtually a coup atmosphere in Pentagoncircles. Not that I had the fear there was about to be a coup—I just thought itwas a mood of hatred and rage. The atmosphere was poisonous, poisonous.”The anti-Kennedy feelings were particularly virulent in the Air Force, which wasunder the command of cigar-chomping General Curtis LeMay, who had made hissavage mark on history with the firebombing of Tokyo during World War II. Thepresident and the general regarded each other with barely concealed disgust.Twenty-five years after JFK’s death, LeMay and his top Air Force generals werestill brooding about Kennedy when they sat down to be interviewed for anofficial Air Force oral history project. “The Kennedy administration,” LeMaygrowled, “thought that being as strong as we were was provocative to theRussians and likely to start a war. We in the Air Force, and I personally,believed the exact opposite.”LeMay and his generals continued to angrily replay the “lost opportunity” of theCuban Missile Crisis: it was the moment “we could have gotten the Communists outof Cuba,” LeMay declared. “We walked Khrushchev up to the brink of nuclear war,he looked over the edge, and had no stomach for it,” said General DavidBurchinal, who served as LeMay’s deputy during the crisis. “We would havewritten our own book at that time, but our politicians did not understand whathappens when you have such a degree of superiority as we had, or they simplydidn’t know how to use it. They were busily engaged in saving face for theSoviets and making concessions, giving up the . . . Jupiters deployedoverseas—when all we had to do was write our own ticket.”By spring 1963, after two years of turbulence, it was clear that Kennedy wassearching for a way to defuse Cuba as an international flashpoint. Abiding byhis missile crisis agreement with Khrushchev, the president began to crack downon the anti-Castro raids operating out of Florida and to withdraw funding fromthe militant exile groups. In April, the leader of the Miami-based CubanRevolutionary Council, the umbrella organization that tied together theanti-Castro movement, announced his resignation, accusing the administration ofcutting a deal with Moscow to “coexist” with Castro. It was now clearthat—despite his pronouncements of solidarity with Cuban “freedomfighters”—Kennedy was not serious about overthrowing the Havana regime. Thismarked the fateful turning point when the rabid, CIA-sponsored activity that hadbeen aimed at Castro shifted its focus to Kennedy.As Kennedy de-escalated the U.S. campaign against Havana, the violentanti-Castro network of spooks, political extremists, paramilitary adventurers,and assassins went underground. The scheming in hotbeds of exile activity likeMiami, New Orleans, and Dallas grew more vicious in the spring and early summerof 1963. Mysterious characters with blood in their eyes began to make theirappearance on history’s stage.One day, Dulles called his former lover, Clare Luce, to warn her about theKennedy administration’s crackdown on the maritime raids she was helping tofinance. “He said to get out of that boat business—he was well aware of it, bythe way—because the neutrality act has now been reasserted and it was againstthe law to aid or abet the Cubans in any attempts to free their country.”Dulles’s old friend, Bill Pawley, the right-wing Miami entrepreneur who had longcollaborated on secret CIA missions, was also warned about his involvement inthe exile raids. But he remained defiant, hatching a plot so ambitious that heclaimed it would bring down Kennedy himself. In April, Pawley wrote a longletter to his political comrade, Dick Nixon, declaring, “All of the Cubans andmost Americans in this part of the country believe that to remove Castro, youmust first remove Kennedy, and that is not going to be easy.” Pawley’s plan wasto assemble a rogue’s crew of Mafia hit men and Cuban desperadoes and to setsail on his sixty-five-foot yacht, the Flying Tiger II, for the waters off Cuba,accompanied by a reporter and photographer from Life magazine to document thedaring mission. Once ashore in Cuba, the raiders were to rendezvous with twoSoviet military officers based on the island who wanted to defect, bringing themback to the United States with explosive evidence that Khrushchev haddouble-crossed Kennedy and had never withdrawn his missiles. The mission wentnowhere: there were no missiles or Soviet defectors, and the raiders themselvesdisappeared, presumably into the jaws of Castro’s security forces.Years later, two of the mercenaries who had slithered through Miami’santi-Castro underworld in the early 1960s claimed that the Pawley raid hadreally been a cover for yet another CIA-Mafia assassination attempt on Castro.The plotting against the Cuban leader continued to flourish, even after the CIAassured the Kennedy administration that it had terminated its alliance with theMafia. Two emissaries from the CIA informed Bobby Kennedy of the assassinationplots at a meeting in his Justice Department office in May 1962. The attorneygeneral, who had built his law enforcement reputation as an aggressive mobhunter, listened to the CIA men with barely contained fury. “I trust that if youever do business with organized crime again—with gangsters—you will let theattorney general know,” he said with icy sarcasm. The CIA officials assuredBobby that the Eisenhower-approved plots had been shut down—but, in truth, theywould continue, without the Kennedys’ knowledge, throughout their administrationand for many years after.The displays of disrespect for President Kennedy’s authority grew more glaringin the clubs and suites of Washington’s permanent government. By the spring of1963, JFK was painfully aware of the profound miscalculation he had made byappointing Eisenhower-Dulles holdovers and “designating conservatives to doliberal things”—particularly in the case of John McCone. In March, thepresident’s secret White House recording system picked up a heated conversationbetween the Kennedy brothers about their increasingly disloyal CIA director.McCone, Bobby informed his brother, was going around Washington feedinganti-Kennedy information to the press. “He’s a real bastard, that John McCone,”responded JFK. “Well, he was useful at a time,” observed Bobby. “Yeah,” repliedthe president ruefully, “but, boy, it’s really evaporated.”Meanwhile, Dulles—who had made a show of harmony with the White House early inhis retirement, telling friends he would continue to consult with thepresident—no longer felt a need to keep up the pretense. He became increasinglyoutspoken in his remarks about Kennedy, despite the earlier reticence he haddisplayed “for the good of the country.” In June, after delivering a lecture inCold Spring Harbor, near his Long Island home, Dulles told reporters that he“doubted” he would ever be willing to work again for the Kennedy administration.He also made clear that the president was not serious about ousting Castro. “Idon’t know of anything that can be done about Cuba—short of intervention,” hesaid. “Once a Communist regime gets fastened in a country and the militaryregime is built up, it’s hard to get that [regime] changed.”In October 1963, Dulles went public with his most direct criticism of theKennedy administration in a militant address that he titled “The Art ofPersuasion: America’s Role in the Ideological Struggle.” In it, Dulles ridiculedthe administration’s “yearning to be ‘loved’ by the rest of the world. . . . Nocountry that wishes to be really popular should aspire to or accept the role ofleadership.” The United States was “too rich and too powerful” to be loved,Dulles declared—and that’s the way it must remain.“I should much prefer to have people respect us than to try to make them loveus,” he continued. “They should realize that we propose to remain strongeconomically and militarily, that we have firm principles and a steady foreignpolicy and will not compromise with communism or appease it.” Here it was, atlast, Dulles’s critique of the Kennedy presidency, in stark relief. JFK was anappeaser, a weak leader who wanted to be loved by our friends and enemies, whenthe man in the White House should be feared and respected.Dulles maintained a busy schedule throughout 1963—speaking, traveling, andmeeting with an intriguing mix of intelligence colleagues, high-powered friends,and, at least on one occasion, a member of the anti-Castro demimonde. The pagesfrom Dulles’s crowded 1963 calendar that were later released by the CIA containnumerous gaps and blackouts. But, even with the curious blanks, his appointmentsbook has the look of belonging to an active espionage professional who was stillfully engaged in a subterranean life. Dulles’s calendar pages and otherdeclassified documents give provocative hints about the retired spy chief’slife, including the identities of some of the obscure characters with whom hewas associating. Here was a man, say these pages, to whom people still looked toget things done.In the summer of 1963, Peter Dale Scott, a young English literature professor atthe University of California’s Berkeley campus, found himself in the thick ofanti-Kennedy ferment. Scott, the son of distinguished Canadian poet F. R. Scott,a mentor of Leonard Cohen, had served as a Canadian diplomat to Poland, and muchof his social life when he arrived in Berkeley revolved around passionatelyanti-Soviet Polish émigrés. One day, a former Polish army colonel who hadbefriended Scott invited him to a dinner party at the Palo Alto home of W. GlennCampbell, the intellectual entrepreneur who built Stanford’s Hoover Institutioninto a leading center of the conservative resurgence in America. At Campbell’shome that evening, the conversation among the sixteen or so guests soon grewheated as it turned to the man in the White House. “In those days, I was notvery active politically, but I was amazed, even shocked, at how reactionary theconversation became around the dinner table,” Scott later recalled. “Most of thetalk focused on the danger presented to the nation by its aberrant president,John F. Kennedy. His failure to dispose of Castro, especially during the missilecrisis, may have been one of the chief complaints, but it was by no means theonly one. The complaints threatened to drag on forever, until one man spoke upwith authority. I’m not sure, but he may even have stood up to do so.”The striking figure who commanded the group’s attention was a Russian Orthodoxpriest in a dark cassock with a crucifix around his neck. He spoke quietly, butwith confidence, assuring the group that they had no need to worry. “The Old Manwill take care of it,” he said simply.At the time, Scott assumed the priest was referring to old Joe Kennedy, whopresumably could be counted on to set his son straight. But by 1963, the Kennedypatriarch was confined to a wheelchair after suffering a massive stroke inDecember 1961 that left him severely debilitated. It was not until years laterthat Scott realized the Russian priest was more likely referring to someoneelse. By then, the Berkeley professor was a respected dean of the JFKassassination research community and had devoted years to studying the politicalforces surrounding the president’s murder. In conversation with a fellow Kennedyresearcher one day, Scott was reminded of the nickname by which Allen Dulles wasaffectionately known in intelligence circles: the Old Man.On that summer evening in 1963, the Russian émigré priest spoke with the calmassurance of a man who knew something the other dinner guests did not. The OldMan will take care of it. That was enough to calm the heated discussion aroundthe table. The Old Man will take care of the Kennedy problem.Among the peculiar figures with whom Dulles met in the spring and summer of 1963was a militant anti-Castro exile named Paulino Sierra Martinez, whose backgroundand affiliations were so murky that even the CIA labeled him “a mystery man” ina memo dated November 20. According to an internal CIA document, Sierra arrangedto meet with Dulles and retired Army general Lucius D. Clay in Washington onApril 15, 1963. Dulles and Clay were unusual company for a man who, not longbefore, had been working as a judo instructor in Miami while studying for hislaw examinations.Like Dulles, General Clay occupied positions in the top ranks of the Americanestablishment. After serving as the U.S. military governor in postwar Germany,Clay had worked with Dulles in Cold War propaganda projects like the Crusade forFreedom, returning to Germany in 1961 as an adviser to President Kennedy duringthe Berlin Wall crisis. Clay dangerously escalated the crisis without thepresident’s authorization by threatening to knock down the recently erected wallwith U.S. Army tanks. It took all of the Kennedy brothers’ back-channeldiplomatic skills to defuse the confrontation at Checkpoint Charlie. A disgustedClay later accused Kennedy of losing his “nerve.” By 1963, Clay had given upmilitary service for a corporate career, taking a senior partner position withLehman Brothers, the Wall Street investment firm, as well as board seats atGeneral Motors and other major companies.Paulino Sierra Martinez was not the type of man with whom Dulles or Claynormally dined at the Army and Navy Club or the Metropolitan Club. The son of aCuban police sergeant, Sierra had worked his way up in Havana society, landing ajob in dictator Fulgencio Batista’s foreign ministry. But some of his intimatessuspected that Sierra’s government post was a cover for his true profession, asa Batista assassin. Fleeing Castro’s Cuba, Sierra settled first in Miami, butafter passing his U.S. bar exams, he went to work in the legal department of theChicago-based Union Tank Car Company, a railroad freight company that had beenbuilt by the Rockefeller family. It was in Chicago that Sierra suddenly emergedas a mysterious player in the confusing and conflict-ridden Cuban exilemovement.In May 1963, following his Washington meeting with Dulles and Clay, Sierra—whowas virtually unknown in anti-Castro circles—convened a meeting of Cuban exileleaders at the Royalton Hotel in Miami. The leaders were skeptical about thetall, well-dressed man from Chicago, with the long, homely face that put somepeople in mind of Lincoln. But the anti-Castro movement was in disarrayfollowing Kennedy’s withdrawal of support, and Sierra arrived in Miami with anenticing proposal—and the promise of big money to go along with it.Sierra told the group that he represented an alliance of major U.S. corporationsthat wanted to regain their lost investments in Cuba. He did not name thecompanies, but on other occasions he dropped such Fortune 500 brand names asUnited Fruit, U.S. Steel, DuPont, and Standard Oil. Sierra claimed that thesecorporations were willing to put up as much as $30 million if the fracturedanti-Castro movement could reassemble itself and mount an invasion of theisland. He explained that such an operation would not have Washington’s officialapproval but would be supported by officers within the U.S. military, who wouldhelp provide weapons and training bases.Freely spreading money around, Sierra attracted enough support from within theanti-Castro network to form a coalition he ambitiously titled the Junta of theGovernment of Cuba in Exile. He crisscrossed the country, drumming up supportfor the new organization and going on a weapons-buying spree. The sources ofSierra’s funds, which were passed to him through Union Tank Car, remainedsomething of a mystery, although an article in The Miami News indicated that atleast some of his money was coming from organized crime lords who were intent onwinning back their Havana gambling casinos and prostitution franchises, whichbefore Castro had been a source of enormous underworld profits.Law enforcement agencies began tracking Sierra as he pursued his shady agenda,but in June the FBI terminated its investigation after concluding that he wasinvolved in nothing more than a “con job.” The Chicago office of the SecretService, however, suspected that Sierra was a more sinister figure. By November1963, Chicago—like Miami, New Orleans, and Dallas—had become a nest ofanti-Kennedy intrigue. On November 2, local Secret Service officials foiled awell-organized assassination plot against President Kennedy. After landing atChicago’s O’Hare Airport that day, Kennedy was scheduled to ride in a motorcadeto Soldier Field for the annual Army-Navy football game. But the motorcade wascanceled after the Secret Service exposed a plot to ambush the president from atall warehouse building as his limousine slowed for a hairpin turn. The plot,which involved a sniper team composed of a disgruntled ex-marine who worked inthe building and at least two Cuban marksmen, bore a disturbing resemblance tothe series of events that would claim Kennedy’s life twenty days later inDallas.The Secret Service could not connect Sierra to the Chicago assassination plot,but his name did come up in relation to another troubling report. On November21, the day before JFK’s assassination, a serious threat against the presidentwas made by an outspoken anti-Kennedy Cuban exile leader named Homer Echevarria.While negotiating an illegal arms purchase, Echevarria reportedly said that hehad “plenty of money” and would conclude the deal “as soon as we take care ofKennedy.” Sources told the Secret Service that the Echevarria weapons purchasewas being financed by Sierra with mob money. After the president’sassassination, the Secret Service planned to pursue an investigation intoEchevarria’s threat and the Sierra arms deal, but the agency’s probe was shutdown by the FBI after President Johnson gave the bureau responsibility for thecase.Following Kennedy’s death, Paulino Sierra Martinez faded from the front lines ofthe anti-Castro campaign. Accused by Union Tank Car’s legal counsel of wastingthe Junta’s funds, he was eventually replaced as head of the organization. Butaccording to relatives of Sierra, he continued to pursue his underground waragainst Castro and other left-wing leaders in Latin America. Tough-looking mencarrying concealed rifles showed up from time to time at Sierra’s Chicagoapartment—men whom one of his children described as “father’s banditos.” Sierra,who frequently packed his own gun, even when taking his young granddaughter tothe zoo one day, continued to travel widely well into the 1970s, including toChile, where he briefly relocated during the CIA-orchestrated unrest that led tothe violent overthrow of President Salvador Allende in 1973.Although Sierra never discussed his hidden life with his son, Paul Sierra becameconvinced that his father was involved with U.S. intelligence. “I think thatpersonally, Father’s patriotism and hatred for the Communists made him go alittle overboard,” the younger man concluded.More than a dozen years after the Secret Service’s abortive effort to find outmore about Paulino Sierra Martinez, the House Select Committee onAssassinations—which reopened the JFK case in the 1970s—again raised questionsabout Sierra. The sprawling congressional investigation ultimately concludedthat Kennedy was the victim of a conspiracy, but it was unable to pin down theidentities of those involved or the source of their funds. Committeeinvestigators were intrigued by Sierra’s unsavory connections, including tothree sketchy characters who showed up with Lee Harvey Oswald at the Dallas homeof Silvia Odio, the daughter of a prominent anti-Castro activist, in September1963. But, in the end, lacking the time and resources to fully pursue its leads,the congressional panel was forced to acknowledge that the “relevance to theassassination” of Sierra’s activities “remained undetermined.”At least the House Select Committee on Assassinations tried to shed some lighton Sierra and his auspices. The first official inquest into President Kennedy’sassassination—conducted by the Warren Commission in 1964—made no serious effortto examine anti-Castro militants like Sierra and their connections to the CIAand organized crime. Despite the Secret Service’s suspicions about Sierra, hisname appears nowhere in the Warren Report’s twenty-six volumes. Allen Dulles, aprominent member of the Warren Commission, could have revealed what he knewabout Sierra. But Dulles never brought up Sierra’s name—nor did he ever informfellow commission members that he had met with someone whom the Secret Serviceregarded as a person of interest in the Kennedy assassination.It remains one of the many enduring mysteries of the Kennedy case. Why didDulles meet with Paulino Sierra Martinez in April 1963? What brought togetherthe former CIA director and an obscure, Mafia-connected, anti-Castro conspiratorwith a penchant for violent action? As Dulles was keenly aware, organizing aparamilitary operation against the Cuban government was, by the spring of 1963,a violation of Kennedy administration policy and of federal law. By meeting witha character like Sierra, Dulles made it abundantly clear how little regard hehad for the president’s authority—and perhaps for his life."},{"pageContent":"17 [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-40]THE PARTING GLASS [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-40]In the summer of 1963, President Kennedy flew to Europe for what would be thefinal overseas trip of his life. Although he had left Washington, the forces ofpolitical tumult set loose by his presidency followed him abroad. These forcescame swirling together in Rome during JFK’s official visit to the ancientimperial capital, where tour guides still pointed out the stone steps on whichJulius Caesar’s blood was spilled.On the sultry evening of July 1, Kennedy was feted by Italian president AntonioSegni at the Quirinale Palace, the official residence of popes, kings, andchiefs of state since the sixteenth century. At the formal banquet—watched overby the extravagantly uniformed Corazzieri honor guard, in their torso-huggingwhite tunics and gold helmets with flowing horsetails—Segni paid tribute duringhis toast to Kennedy’s recent Peace Speech at American University. Kennedy’s“dynamic” quest for peace, declared Segni, was a welcome break from the “static”era of nuclear deadlock. After Segni concluded his welcoming remarks, JFK stoodup and reiterated his peace message, telling the assembled dignitaries that “waris not inevitable, and that an effective end to the arms race would offergreater security than its indefinite continuation.” Invoking Italy’s volatilepolitical history, Kennedy then warned of “the siren temptation of those withseemingly swift and easy answers on the far right and the far left.” It was upto those who advocated “social justice and progress and human rights,” saidKennedy, to make the more difficult ideals of democracy a reality for people allover the world.Kennedy’s Italian itinerary, which included an audience with the new pope, PaulVI, at the Vatican and a side trip to Naples, was the finale to a triumphantEuropean tour that was highlighted by a sentimental stopover in Ireland and hisresounding challenge to Soviet tyranny at the Berlin Wall (“Ich bin ein Berliner. . .”). The crowds in Rome that greeted Kennedy’s motorcade were comparativelysparse, as the presidential limousine and its police motorcycle squadron madethe long and winding trip to the Quirinale along the boulevards and narrowstreets of the capital. The Eternal City could be blasé about visitingdignitaries, and the summer heat was sweltering. Yet underneath the city’sunruffled exterior ran a shiver of excitement about the visiting Americanpresident who cut such a bella figura—particularly in contrast to Italy’s aging,white-haired leaders. Even L’Unità, the Italian Communist Party newspaper,appreciatively noted JFK’s tall, tan good looks and his stylish blue-gray suitand purple tie.But as the young American president was taking the spotlight at the Quirinale,the forces aligned against him were converging in Rome. Behind the elaboratefestivities at the palace that night was an intense Italian political drama, onewith international ramifications. Since the mid-1950s, Italy had been hotlydebating l’apertura a sinistra—“the opening to the left”—a political deal thatwould peel away the Socialist Party from its traditional Communist Party alliesand result in a left-center coalition with the ruling Christian Democrats.Pietro Nenni, the wily, seventy-two-year-old political survivor who headed theSocialist Party, had been diligently trying to maneuver his party away from itsalliance with the Italian Communists ever since the Soviet invasion of Hungaryin 1956. Nenni hoped that with a forward-looking new president in the WhiteHouse, the United States—which had quietly dominated Italian politics sinceWorld War II—would finally give its blessing to the apertura.The Eisenhower administration had flatly opposed the opening to the left, seeinga Socialist partnership with the Christian Democrats as a slippery slope thatwould lead to a Communist-dominated government in Rome. Eisenhower officialsworried that if the Socialists were allowed into Italy’s government, they wouldtry to steer Rome on a neutral course between Washington and Moscow. TheCIA—which had a proprietary sensibility about Italy, dating back to itswell-funded, covert campaign to thwart a Communist Party victory in thecountry’s 1948 elections—engaged in its usual schemes, along with its allies inthe Italian intelligence services, to block the apertura. The agency’s anti-leftstrategy in Italy was spearheaded by Jim Angleton who, with his deep personalroots in the country, had turned Rome into a key Cold War battleground. TheEisenhower administration’s resistance to the apertura was further enforced byClare Booth Luce, Ike’s ambassador to Rome.It was Arthur Schlesinger who convinced President Kennedy to break withEisenhower policy and support Italy’s opening to the left. “My impression isthat [Nenni] has honestly broken with the Communists,” the White House aideinformed Kennedy in a March 1962 memo. Schlesinger had his own sentimentalattachment to Italy, dating back to his boyhood when his father offeredsanctuary in Harvard’s history department to anti-Mussolini exile GaetanoSalvemini, an Italian Socialist politician and historian.Angleton was so furious about the new tilt in favor of Nenni’s Socialists thathe began telling people that Schlesinger was a Soviet agent. Meanwhile, formerambassador Luce lobbied frantically against the apertura, dashing off a long,somewhat incoherent letter to JFK in February 1963, filled with randomobservations about the growing threat from the left in Rome. “Italy’s pro-Westgovernment has had one foot on the Moscow banana peel for seventeen years,” sheobserved. If the “pro-Communist Socialists” were brought into power, “theItalian Communist Party will negotiate Italy’s future with the U.S.S.R.” Luceconcluded by warning the president not to fall into a left-wing trap during hisvisit to Rome. “In the present climate, there is a real possibility you may bevery embarrassed by the enthusiastic reception you will get from the Communists!I can see the banners now: ‘Vivo [sic] Kennedy e Khrushchev!’”Frustrated by the stubborn bureaucratic resistance that Kennedy was receivingfrom within his own government to his shifting policy on Italy, Schlesinger sentthe president an angry memo in January 1963. “Lest you think you run the U.S.government, the [Italy] matter is still under debate,” the White House aideacidly remarked.But President Kennedy eventually ignored the political pushback and embracedItaly’s apertura. He became so enamored of the idea of building a strongcenter-left coalition to anchor Italy’s turbulent politics that he arranged forUnited Auto Workers leaders Walter and Victor Reuther, to whom he had strongpolitical ties, to help fund Nenni’s party. JFK’s trip to Rome gave him theopportunity to officially anoint the opening to the left.After dinner at the Quirinale, Kennedy used the rest of the evening to quietlycommunicate his views to the leading Italian political figures gathered at theevent. As the president strolled along the gravel paths of the lush palacegarden, he was approached by various politicians and officials, includingPalmiro Togliatti, the head of Italy’s potent Communist Party, with whom heexchanged a few words. When an Italian news photographer snapped a shot of thetwo men in conversation, Kennedy later asked him for the film, concerned aboutthe impact that the photo might have in Italy’s fraught political climate.Amazingly, the photographer obliged the American president.In a far corner of the garden, a low wooden platform bathed in spotlights hadbeen set up for the president to hold private audiences with Italy’sdignitaries. The longest conversation that Kennedy held that evening was withthe old Socialist warrior, Pietro Nenni. As the two men huddled together on thelittle stage, their faces nearly touching, they were a study in contrasts:Kennedy tall, youthful, and glamorous; Nenni, diminutive, bespectacled, andbalding. But Nenni clearly felt he had found a political soul mate in Kennedy.The previous year, Nenni had tweaked the U.S. foreign policy establishment withan essay in Foreign Affairs, in which he defended his party’s neutralist standin the Cold War and attacked Western imperialism, charging U.S. and Europeangovernments with backing “Fascist-type dictatorships” in the Third World. “Theyhave spent hundreds of millions of dollars in shoring up rotten situationsdoomed in any case to crumble,” wrote the Italian. “They have opened doors toCommunists instead of supporting democratic and socialist forces that would becapable of directing the impulse to freedom of the colonial peoples.” Now, as along line of other Italian politicians waited impatiently to speak with Kennedy,Nenni was engaged in rapt conversation with an American president who had voicedthe same sentiments.When his audience with Kennedy finally came to an end, Nenni was “absolutelyenraptured and happy as he could be,” according to a U.S. embassy official whowas there. Stepping off the platform, the old man wrapped his arms around hiswife and murmured something into her ear. As they walked away, Nenni wiped tearsfrom his eyes. Later, Nenni’s wife told a group of American diplomats attendingthe Quirinale event that her husband had been “enchanted” by JFK. The Socialistleader was convinced that his political dream was about to come true: afteryears of determined U.S. resistance, Italy’s democratic left was at last tobecome part of the government.The president, too, thought his trip to Rome was a “considerable success,”telling Schlesinger on his return to Washington that he had a “good talk” withNenni and adding, “So far as I could see, everyone in Italy is for an opening tothe left.”But Allen Dulles and his old cohorts in the CIA’s Rome station did not share thepresident’s enthusiasm for the Italian political developments, and they boldlycommunicated their dissent to Christian Democratic officials. This is aremarkable and, until now, unreported story, one that sheds new light on thegrowing fissures in the Kennedy administration. Shortly after JFK flew home fromItaly, Dino John Pionzio, the CIA’s leading operator in Italy at the time,huddled with Sereno Freato, the administrative secretary of Aldo Moro—a risingstar in the Christian Democratic Party who would soon become Italy’s primeminister. Pionzio, a Skull and Bones member at Yale (Class of 1950) and zealousCold Warrior, was adamantly opposed to the opening to the left. The CIA manwanted to know what Moro had discussed with Kennedy a few days earlier during anafternoon stroll that JFK and the Italian politician had taken through theQuirinale garden. To his great dismay, Pionzio was told that Moro and Kennedyhad agreed the apertura should go forward.Dulles and the CIA felt they had a proprietary relationship with the ChristianDemocrats, ever since those early Cold War days when the agency began funnelingmoney to the Italian party. Dulles himself had confirmed this arrangement whenhe was CIA director, during a secret meeting with Moro that was held in Freato’sRome office. Following this meeting, the Christian Democratic Party became thebeneficiary of CIA funds that arrived promptly on a monthly schedule. By theearly 1960s, the party was receiving 60 million lire a month (about $100,000)from the spy agency. In the beginning, it was Freato who collected the cash in alarge suitcase, a duty that later fell to other administrative secretaries ofthe party. These monthly CIA payoffs to the party were in addition to theunder-the-table contributions made to the Christian Democrats during variouspolitical campaigns.Pionzio’s meeting with Freato put the Christian Democrats on notice: theirbudding alliance with the Socialists did not enjoy full support in Washington,particularly in national security circles. Afterward, Moro, who had receivedconflicting messages from Kennedy and the CIA within a matter of days, could beforgiven if he was confused about who was actually running the U.S. government.The CIA’s attempt to subvert the apertura was one more flagrant example of howthe agency sought to undermine the Kennedy presidency, as well as Italiandemocracy.In November 1963, Aldo Moro finally formed a coalition government with theSocialists, despite the less-than-enthusiastic reaction from the ChristianDemocrats’ patrons in the CIA. Socialist leaders hoped that the historiccenter-left partnership would lead to a new golden age of social progress forItaly. But their dreams were not fulfilled. Even before JFK’s assassination onNovember 22, the die-hard opponents of the apertura in the CIA and Italianintelligence services were actively conspiring to sabotage the deal. WhenWilliam K. Harvey arrived in Italy in summer 1963 to take over the Rome CIAstation, the offensive against democracy, in Italy and the United States, took adark turn.Bill Harvey was an odd choice for Rome station chief. He spoke no Italian and hehad no affinity for the Italian people or interest in their history and culture.A gruff, bulbous man with a frog-like voice, he was born and raised in a smallIndiana town and had none of the cosmopolitan polish of his Ivy League–bred CIAcolleagues. Harvey began his intelligence career as an FBI gumshoe, but hishard-drinking habits did not go down well in J. Edgar Hoover’s stern nannyculture, and he jumped ship for the newly formed CIA in 1947. The blunt-spoken,pistol-packing Harvey was not a good fit with the CIA either, but the agencywould find ways to put him to use. Dulles and Helms thought he had a “cop”mentality. Harvey, in turn, dismissed the CIA’s upper echelons as “Fifth Avenuecowboys” and “fucking namby-pambies.” He was no hayseed, he felt obliged toremind colleagues—he had been raised by a single mother who became a fullprofessor at Indiana State University, and he had a law degree. He liked torattle the agency’s Ivy League types during meetings by pulling out one of themany guns he owned, spinning the cylinder and checking the load, as if he wereabout to use it.From his days as an FBI Red-hunter, when he tracked down Communists and fellowtravelers in Washington, Harvey became convinced that high society was riddledwith traitors. Harvey’s class resentments no doubt played a role when he becamethe first CIA official to sniff out Kim Philby, the witty, urbane,Cambridge-educated double agent who was stationed in Washington from 1949 to1951. At one of Philby’s liquor-soaked parties, Guy Burgess—the most flamboyantmember of the Cambridge spy ring—drew a lewd, crotch-baring caricature ofHarvey’s wife, Libby, a boozy Indiana gal who never fit into the CIA social set.A drunken Harvey threw himself at Burgess and had to be pulled away by Angleton.It was the Indiana “cop” who saw through Philby, not Angleton, who remainedforever beguiled by his British friend. Angleton and Harvey were the odd coupleof CIA counterintelligence—“the poet and the cop,” as one observer called them.They would alternately clash and connive together throughout their careers.Harvey’s star rose at the agency after he exposed Philby, and he was dispatchedto the Cold War front lines in Germany, where he ran the CIA’s Berlin stationduring the 1950s. His reputation continued to grow as he constantly searched fornew ways to take the battle to the Soviet enemy. While in Germany, Harvey workedclosely with Reinhard Gehlen’s notorious organization, and Gehlen came toconsider him a “very esteemed [and] really reliable friend.”The Berlin spy tunnel—an underground surveillance project that wormed its wayinto the city’s Russian sector, permitting the CIA to eavesdrop on enemycommunications—was Harvey’s most dramatic coup. Dulles, who always had a softspot for espionage theatrics, called Harvey’s tunnel “one of the most daring andvaluable operations ever,” even though the Soviets quickly discovered thesubterranean project and began using it to feed disinformation to the Americans.Despite Harvey’s crude ways and his penchant for intemperate action, Dulles, whoneeded action heroes to boost the agency’s image, helped turn him into a CIAlegend, awarding him the Distinguished Intelligence Medal, the agency’s highestaccolade.Dulles brought Harvey back to Washington in 1959. By then he had a second wife,Clara Grace (“CG”) Harvey, a big, vivacious woman who had enjoyed her ownsuccessful career in the U.S. military and CIA. One of CG Harvey’s secretassignments involved accompanying former Nazi rocket scientists, includingWerner von Braun, and their families on flights to the United States, where theywere put to work on U.S. missile and space projects. When Bill and CG—whom hecalled “Mommy”—returned home, they brought with them their adopted daughter,Sally, whom they had found as an infant when she was left in a cardboard shoebox on the doorstep of their West Berlin home. Back in Washington, Harvey hadhigh ambitions: he wanted to run the agency’s Soviet division, a top post thathe thought he had earned by his aggressive performance in Germany. But the CIAelite, who continued to think of him as a cop, steered him into rougherassignments.Dulles named Harvey chief of the agency’s Division D, the unit in charge ofsignals intelligence—gathering information through various means of electroniceavesdropping, which the CIA shared with the National Security Agency. ButDivision D also seemed to have more mysterious functions. In October 1960,according to one agency document, Harvey made a trip to Europe that was largelyintended for him to recruit criminal underworld figures for secret CIA missions.Among those he sought out were safecrackers and break-in specialists. Harveywould soon be dealing with men whose skills were of a more violent nature.In November 1961, Harvey was put in charge of the top secret CIA operation tokill Castro, code-named ZR/RIFLE. He quickly nudged aside Bob Maheu, theindependent contractor the CIA had originally hired to run its murder racket inthe Caribbean, and began working directly with Mafia ambassador at large, JohnnyRosselli.The dumpy, baggy-panted cop and the dapper, silver-haired gangster with thetailored suits formed a tight, if unlikely, bond. Harvey invited Rosselli todinner at his family’s spacious Chevy Chase home, where little Sally took tocalling him “Uncle Johnny.” The two men had secret, martini-fueled rendezvous inthe Miami area, where the CIA maintained its largest station, JM/WAVE, andoperated a bustling network of paramilitary training bases as well as safehouses in the posh Coral Gables and Key Biscayne neighborhoods. Harvey providedRosselli with vials of poison and stockpiles of guns to pass along to theMafia’s hired killers in Cuba. Nothing ever came of the two men’s Cuba schemes,and Castro continued to thrive. But Harvey never lost faith in his Mafiapartner. Regardless of his criminal background, Rosselli was a man of “integrityas far as I was concerned,” Harvey would tell Senate investigators years later,a man who was always loyal and dependable “in his dealings with me.”“I loved Rosselli,” CG Harvey said during an interview at her Indianapolisretirement home in 1999, the year before she died. “My husband always used tosay that if I had to ride shotgun, that’s the guy I would take with me. Muchbetter than any of the law enforcement people. Rosselli was the kind of guy thatif he gave you his desires and friendship, well he was going to stick by you.And he definitely was Mafia, and he definitely was a crook, and he definitelyhad pulled off all kinds of stunts with the Mafia. But he was a patriot, hebelieved in the United States. And he knew my husband was a patriot, and that’swhat drew him to Bill.”In 1962, Helms—who, along with Angleton, had replaced the “retired” Dulles asHarvey’s main patrons at the agency—promoted the agency tough guy, naming himhead of the CIA’s entire Cuba operation, Task Force W. Helms and Harvey keptmuch of the operation, including their assassination efforts against Castro, asecret from President Kennedy as well as from CIA director McCone. Harvey grewdeeply contemptuous of the Kennedy brothers, whom he regarded as rich boys whowere playing with the nation’s security. He concluded that their subversionprogram aimed at overthrowing Castro’s regime, code-named Operation Mongoose,was all for show. Harvey thought so little of the man JFK put in charge ofMongoose, Air Force officer Edward Lansdale, that he would lift his ass in themiddle of their meetings and let loose a fart or pull out a knife and begin totrim his nails.Harvey came to hate Bobby Kennedy—the CIA overseer who was constantly nipping athis heels—most of all. RFK browbeat Harvey so severely during one White Housemeeting on Cuba that Max Taylor later told the attorney general, “You could sacka town and enjoy it.” Harvey took to calling RFK “that fucker” and begansuggesting that some of the attorney general’s actions bordered on treason.“Bobby Kennedy and my husband were absolute enemies, just pure enemies,”recalled CG Harvey in her retirement home, channeling Bill Harvey’s deepresentments years later. “[Bobby] was an idiot . . . and he had no confidence inhimself, because his brother put him in a job that he really wasn’t capable ofhandling. It made for a lot of stress for the people who were working in lawenforcement.”The tension between the two men finally exploded in October 1962, when Harveyschemed with the Pentagon to send a series of raiding parties into Cuba at theheight of the missile crisis to pave the way for the U.S. military invasion thatadministration hard-liners hoped was imminent. RFK was outraged by Harvey’sreckless behavior in the midst of the hair-trigger nuclear crisis. “You weredealing with people’s lives,” the younger Kennedy brother later exclaimed, “andthen you’re going to go off with a half-assed operation such as this?”Harvey’s protectors acted quickly before Bobby Kennedy could ax him. Helmsrealized that he would have to relieve Harvey of the Cuba command and hustle himout of Washington. Giving him Rome was Angleton’s idea. Angleton thought the CIAstation there had gone soft and was not doing enough to snoop on Sovietskullduggery in the Eternal City and not working hard enough to block theopening to the left. Harvey’s ruthlessness had not played well with the Kennedysin Washington, but it was just what Angleton wanted in Rome.Helms and Angleton did not tell McCone about Harvey’s new assignment until itwas a fait accompli. They knew that McCone was “something of a snob and apuritan,” in the words of an aide—the kind of executive who liked to keep hishands clean—and the down-and-dirty Harvey “just wasn’t his cup of tea.”Many imperial agents of America would have regarded Rome as a dream assignment.But Harvey and his wife never took to Italy; they “were very fond of Germany,and they didn’t like anything about Rome,” according to one CIA officer. Billdespised the Italian people, whom he called “goddam wops.” CG complained aboutbeing constantly cheated by the locals whenever she went to the market, and shecouldn’t get used to navigating through the narrow cobblestone streets in thefamily’s hulking Ford station wagon. Once, when CG was driving Sally and thedaughter of another CIA officer along the ancient Appian Way on their way to thebeach, she snarled, “I just don’t understand why they don’t bulldoze all thisand make it a freeway.” Like her husband, who would sit with his back to thewall whenever he dined out in Rome, his .38 revolver within easy reach, CG alsofelt besieged by enemies. She claimed that people in a “Communist compound” nearthe Harveys’ villa would throw rats over the wall into their garden, forcing CGto chase the scurrying vermin out of the family dining room.According to CG, one of her husband’s less savory tasks was procuringprostitutes for President Kennedy while he was in Rome. “When Jack was in Romevisiting the Embassy, my husband had to assign two men, along with the [Secret]Service men who were protecting him. And these two men were required to getItalian prostitutes into Jack’s bed, two at a time. . . . I mean [the Kennedys]were a lousy group of people, I mean they were really scum.” Despite JFK’sreputation for sexual adventurism, it is highly unlikely that the presidentwould have relied on a notoriously anti-Kennedy CIA officer whom his brotherloathed and distrusted to act as his pimp. Nor had Harvey even taken command ofthe Rome operation by the time of Kennedy’s visit. It was, in fact, Harvey whoseemed to indulge in a reckless sex life in Rome. Rumors about his sexualindiscretions circulated throughout the Rome station, including a story thatHarvey had impregnated his young secretary.While stationed in Rome, the Harveys were quartered in a lovely, fawn-coloredvilla on Janiculum Hill owned by the American Academy. Galileo once stargazed inthe villa’s gardens. But Bill and CG had little interest in ancient history.They spent a lot of time and money redecorating the house—“in poor taste,”observed Harvey’s deputy, F. Mark Wyatt. If the Harveys were the stereotypicalUgly Americans, Wyatt and his wife, Ann, were ideal representatives of theUnited States. The Wyatts, who had fallen in love in Rome after the war whenthey were both young CIA agents, were enchanted by the city and spoke Italianfluently. Ann Wyatt took her three young children on rambling tours of Rome,tracking down works by Caravaggio and other masters in galleries and churchesand stumbling upon one of the sets where Cleopatra was being filmed at the time.One night, the Wyatts bumped into Marcello Mastroianni in a restaurant andbrought home his autograph.Mark Wyatt, who enjoyed good relations with local officials, was supposed to actas a buffer between the brusque Harvey and the CIA’s counterparts in Italianintelligence. But Harvey soon bulled his way into the china shop and beganthrowing his bulk around. Italy’s military intelligence unit, SIFAR (ServizioInformazioni Forze Armate, or Defense Information Service), had a long,subservient relationship with the CIA, providing the Americans with the resultsof their spying on Italian political figures and partnering with the UnitedStates on Operation Gladio, the secret “stay-behind army” program to resistleft-wing advances in Europe.But now Harvey pushed SIFAR officials to take even more aggressive actions. TheCIA station chief urged Colonel Renzo Rocca, a top SIFAR counterespionage chief,to sabotage the center-left partnership that had gained decisive momentum withKennedy’s visit. Harvey pushed Rocca to use his “action squads” to carry outbombings of Christian Democratic Party offices and newspapers—terrorist actsthat were to be blamed on the left.Wyatt was no shrinking violet when it came to covert action. He had served as aCIA bagman during the 1948 elections in Italy, handing over suitcases filledwith cash to Italian officials in the luxurious Hotel Hassler overlooking theSpanish Steps. Later, Wyatt was one of the main liaison agents between the CIAand Operation Gladio, frequently visiting the secret Gladio headquarters on theisland of Sardinia. Nor was Wyatt one of those delicate desk heroes who hadnever risked his life. He had grown up in the farm country around Sacramento,picking fruit after school for his father’s cannery. During the war, whileserving as a young Navy officer in the South Pacific, Wyatt’s ship was attackedby Japanese submarines and kamikaze planes, and he had seen men blown to bloodymist before his eyes.But Wyatt had his limits when it came to carrying out Harvey’s orders. Not onlydid Bill Harvey see nothing wrong with violating Italian sovereignty, but he sawmurder as a legitimate political tool. One day, Wyatt was stunned to hear hisboss propose recruiting Mafia hit men to kill Italian Communist officials. WhenWyatt objected to his extreme suggestions, Harvey would fly into a rage. Duringone angry showdown between the two men, Harvey pulled a gun on Wyatt.Harvey’s secret efforts to subvert Italy’s center-left government reached aclimax in 1964, when General Giovanni de Lorenzo—former SIFAR director and chiefof the carabinieri, Italy’s paramilitary police—threatened to overthrow thegovernment and arrest hundreds of leftist politicians unless Socialist officialsagreed to abandon their reform proposals and accept a weaker role in thecoalition government. The elderly Nenni, who had suffered exile and imprisonmentunder Mussolini’s regime, harbored deep anxieties about a fascist revival inItaly, and he quickly gave in to General de Lorenzo’s demands. Wyatt laterinsisted that he had no involvement in the coup plot. But de Lorenzo was widelyconsidered a stooge of the CIA, and there is little doubt that Harvey played arole in the brusque and successful effort to intimidate Italian democracy. Bythen, Kennedy was dead and could not protect Italy’s fragile politicalexperiment as he had intervened against the French military putsch in 1961. WhenNenni anxiously asked Schlesinger, who visited Rome in the spring of 1964,whether the new American president, Lyndon Johnson, could be counted on tocontinue JFK’s Italy policies, Schlesinger had to give the old man the“chilling” truth.Mark Wyatt was attending a meeting at the Gladio base in Sardinia with BillHarvey when he heard that President Kennedy had been shot at high noon inDallas. When the telex arrived, in the early evening local time, Wyatt foundHarvey collapsed in bed, following a late-afternoon round of martinis. AfterWyatt managed to rouse him, the CIA station chief blurted out some provocativeremarks about the events in Dallas that deeply disturbed Wyatt for the rest ofhis life. According to his three children, Wyatt, who died in 2006, ateighty-six, would always suspect that Harvey had some prior knowledge of theKennedy assassination or was in some way involved.“My dad would sometimes talk about Harvey in the context of the Kennedyassassination,” said Wyatt’s son Tom. “He talked about the connection betweenHarvey and the Mafia—not just his involvement with Johnny Rosselli, but with theMafia in Italy. Those connections in Italy worried my father a lot.” Wyatt’ssuspicions about his Rome boss were so strong that his daughter, Susan,encouraged him to testify before the House Select Committee on Assassinations in1978, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it. “My father really believed inCIA—he really wanted to believe in it, and he was loyal to it, despite all itsflaws,” Susan recalled. “And he really didn’t want to do things that would hurtit.”But Wyatt continued to be haunted by Harvey and the Kennedy assassination lateinto his life. In 1998, when a French investigative journalist named FabrizioCalvi came to interview Wyatt about Operation Gladio at his retirement home onCalifornia’s Lake Tahoe, the former CIA official felt compelled to raise thesubject, out of the blue, as Calvi was leaving. “As he was walking me out to mycar, Wyatt suddenly said, ‘You know, I always wondered what Bill Harvey wasdoing in Dallas in November 1963,’” Calvi recently recalled. “Excuse me?” saidthe stunned French journalist, who realized that Harvey’s presence in Dallasthat month was extremely noteworthy.Wyatt explained that he had bumped into Harvey on a plane to Dallas sometimebefore the assassination, and when he asked his boss why he was going there,Harvey answered vaguely, saying something like, “I’m here to see what’shappening.”When Calvi tried to pursue the conversation, Wyatt cut it off as abruptly as hehad started it and said good-bye. Calvi himself forgot about Wyatt’s remarksuntil years later.“I wouldn’t be surprised to learn that Harvey was in Dallas in November 1963,”House Assassinations Committee investigator Dan Hardway, who was assigned by thepanel to probe possible CIA connections to JFK’s murder, observed years later.“We considered Harvey to be one of our prime suspects from the very start. Hehad all the key connections—to organized crime, to the CIA station in Miamiwhere the plots against Castro were run, to other prime CIA suspects like DavidPhillips. We tried to get Harvey’s travel vouchers and security file from theCIA, but they always blocked us. But we did come across a lot of memos thatsuggested he was traveling a lot in the months leading up to the assassination.”(More recent legal efforts by the author to obtain Harvey’s travel records fromthe CIA also proved fruitless, despite the 1992 JFK Records Act, which requiredall federal agencies to release documents related to the Kennedy assassination.)CIA officials later talked about Harvey’s stint in Rome as a sad exile for aonce-illustrious agent—a drunken last stand before his shameful exit from theagency. But that’s not how Harvey himself—or his deputy—regarded his Romeinterlude. Harvey still saw himself at the center of action, crawling throughthe criminal underworld, stockpiling weapons, conspiring with Italian securityofficials—in short, doing whatever was necessary for the cause of freedom. Asfor Wyatt, he saw his boss as a dangerous character, rather than a figure ofpathos—a man who he would always suspect played a deeply sinister role inAmerican history.If Rome was filled with the greatest amount of political intrigue during JFK’sfinal tour of Europe, then his four-day stopover in Ireland in late June 1963brimmed over with the greatest emotion for Kennedy. There was no compellingpolitical reason for the president to visit the Emerald Isle, as KennyO’Donnell, his fellow Boston Irishman but tough-minded adviser, told him. “Itwould be a waste of time,” O’Donnell said. “You’ve got all the Irish votes inthis country you’ll ever get. If you go to Ireland, people will say it’s just apleasure trip.”But to Kennedy—exhausted from the constant barrage of Cold War crises abroad andthe turmoil within his own administration—that sounded exactly like what hewanted: a pleasure trip to Ireland.For Kennedy—whose eight great-grandparents had all left Ireland for Boston, partof the heartbreaking depopulation of the island under British colonialrule—returning to Ireland was both a homecoming and a farewell. The first U.S.president to visit Ireland—and an Irish American one at that—JFK was embraced bythe Irish people as one of their own as he traveled throughout the island,visiting his ancestral homes and drinking tea and eating cold salmon sandwicheswith his few remaining Irish relatives. The young and old poured into thestreets in Dublin and Galway and Cork and Limerick, cheering and franticallywaving little American flags. Women with tears in their eyes held up rosarybeads and shouted, “God bless you,” as his open presidential limousine creptslowly along the weathered stone streets, with a beaming JFK standing tall inthe back of the vehicle. Schoolchildren sang “Danny Boy” and “The Boys ofWexford,” his favorite Irish songs. On jam-packed O’Connell Street in downtownDublin, a group of nuns broke into a jig for Kennedy.The Secret Service had warned local officials that Kennedy should be kept at asafe distance from the exuberant crowds because the jostling could injure hisfragile back. But Kennedy himself ignored his guards, wading into packs ofpeople, who grabbed at him and embraced him and clapped him on the back. Insteadof exhausting him, the trip clearly rejuvenated Kennedy. When the presidentfirst arrived at the U.S. embassy in Dublin, where he and his entourage werestaying, he looked “very tired . . . and he seemed in a very thoughtful mood,”according to Dorothy Tubridy, a longtime Irish friend of the Kennedy family.“But as each day went on, he became happier and more relaxed.”“From the time he stepped off that plane [at Shannon Airport], it was love atfirst sight,” Dave Powers, Kennedy’s other indispensable Boston Irishman, laterrecalled. “He fell in love with Ireland, more and more after four days. And theIrish people fell in love with him . . . because he was one of theirs. He knewit, and they knew it. . . . He was president of the United States, and he wasone of their own.”Ireland was still poor, still divided by religion and British rule, stillexporting its sons and daughters across the ocean as laborers and hired help.But here was John Fitzgerald Kennedy, a shining symbol of Irish resilience andsuccess, returned to them at last. “Here he was, a good-looking man, marvelousteeth, lots of hair, beautiful wife and children, quick intellect—an Irishmanand a Catholic,” recalled a Dublin journalist who covered JFK’s majestic visit.“He could have been any of our cousins.”The trip brought out Kennedy’s fine, dry wit. He seemed to get looser at eachpublic event. “When my great-grandfather left here to become a cooper in EastBoston, he carried nothing with him except two things—a strong religious faithand a strong desire for liberty,” JFK told a crowd in the port town of New Ross,from where Patrick Kennedy had shipped out one hundred years before, only to dieafter ten years of backbreaking labor in his new homeland, leaving four youngchildren behind. But JFK had the Irish gift for turning sorrow into laughter.“If he hadn’t left, I’d be working over there at the Albatross Company,” hesaid, pointing in the direction of a local fertilizer business, as the crowdbroke into uproarious laughter. “Or,” Kennedy continued, after a practicedpause, “perhaps for John V. Kelley”—a local pub owner, which brought new howlsfrom the audience.In Wexford, Kennedy told the crowd, “There is an impression in Washington thatthere are no Kennedys left in Ireland, that they are all in Washington, so Iwonder if there are any Kennedys in this audience.” A few hands fluttered in theair. “Well,” smiled JFK, “I am glad to see a few cousins who didn’t catch theboat.”But Kennedy was also deeply aware of Ireland’s sense of loss and the sweettragedy of life, and he beguiled crowds with verses of Irish poetry, snippets ofGaelic—the unconquered language—and quotations from the island’s literaryheroes. JFK had done his homework before the trip, reading and memorizing anddipping deeply into Ireland’s cultural heritage. He knew that words were the keyto the nation’s heart. In February, as he was preparing for his Ireland trip,Kennedy had even invited the Clancy Brothers, the popular Irish singers, toperform for him at the White House. The folk group ended all of their concertswith a traditional drinking song called “The Parting Glass”—an achinglybeautiful tune that captured all of the Irish farewells down through the years.As Kennedy toured the green island, he carried within him that unique Irishsensibility, that deep knowingness of the inevitability, and the nobility, ofdefeat—and the implacable will to carry on, in defiance of one’s fate. “He neverwould have been President had he not been Irish,” Jackie Kennedy later wrote toÉamon de Valera, the eighty-year-old Irish president and legendary rebel leaderwho had hosted JFK during his visit. “All the history of your people is a longone of overcoming obstacles. He felt that burden on him as a young Irishman inBoston—and he had so many obstacles in his life—his religion, his health, hisyouth. He fought against each one from the time he was a boy, and by alwaysstriving, he ended as President. He was so conscious of his heritage—and soproud of it.”Reminiscing about his Ireland trip later with O’Donnell and Powers, JFK saidthat the emotional highlight for him had been his visit to Arbour Hill, hallowedground for the Irish people. It was here where the leaders of the 1916 EasterRising, who had been executed by the British at Kilmainham Jail, were laid torest. Kennedy, who placed a wreath on their graves, was the first foreign headof state to honor the martyrs of Irish nationalism. It was a poignant moment, asthe Irish Army Band played Chopin’s “Funeral March” and a sad folk song called“Flowers of the Forest,” with the young Irish American president standingsilently next to frail, half-blind de Valera, who as a young rebel leader hadalso faced the hangman’s noose at Kilmainham Jail.Kennedy was fascinated by the story of little Ireland’s rising against themighty British Empire, and he grilled de Valera during the trip about his rolein the rebellion. How did de Valera escape the fate of his fellow rebel leaders,JFK wanted to know? Only because he was born in New York, explained the Irishpresident, and the British—eager to cajole America into World War I—werereluctant to offend their essential allies. “But there were many times when thekey in my jail cell was turned and I thought my turn had come,” the old man toldKennedy.After laying the wreath at Arbour Hill, JFK delivered a nationally televisedspeech before the Irish parliament. The speech made clear where Kennedy’ssympathies lay in Ireland’s long struggle for independence—a struggle thatcontinued in Northern Ireland, where the British still held sway. Theindomitable people of Ireland had inspired the world, Kennedy told the assembly.“For every nation knows that Ireland was the first of the small countries in thetwentieth century to win its struggle for independence.” By standing up to“foreign domination, Ireland is the example and the inspiration to thoseenduring endless years of oppression.” JFK, fresh from his stirring speech atthe Berlin Wall, certainly had the peoples of Soviet-ruled Eastern Europe inmind. But there were also echoes in Kennedy’s liberationist rhetoric of hisearlier speeches about the anticolonial struggles of Vietnam and Algeria.As Schlesinger noted, Kennedy’s speeches stirred the forces of freedom aroundthe world. In Ireland, his visit electrified a new generation struggling to freeitself from the medieval domination of the Catholic Church and centuries ofcolonial backwardness. Later, working on his 1965 White House memoir, A ThousandDays, Schlesinger banged out a random observation on his typewriter thatcaptured the unique global power of the Kennedy aura: “JFK accomplished anAmericanization of the world far deeper & subtler than anything JFD [John FosterDulles] ever dreamed of—not a world Americanized in the sense of adopting theplatitudes & pomposities of free enterprise—but a world Americanized in theperceptions & rhythms of life. JFK conquered the drm of yth [sic]; he penetratedthe world as jazz penetrated it, as Bogart and Salinger [JD] and Faulknerpenetrated it; not the world of the chancelleries but the underground world offantasy & hope.”But if Kennedy’s presidency gave rise to dreams, it also triggered fear andreaction. To the Cold War establishment and other bastions of the old guard, JFKwas not a charismatic symbol of change, he was a stark threat. It was clear bythis point in his embattled presidency why Kennedy was so enthralled by legendsof the Irish martyrs. Their deaths were his own death foretold. As he preparedfor his trip to Ireland, Kennedy had come under the spell of an Irish poem abouta fallen leader from days of old named Eoghan Ruadh O’Neill, reciting its versesso often in the White House that they stuck in his staff members’ heads. Thepoem, by the early nineteenth-century Irish patriot and poet Thomas Davis, whohimself died young, at age thirty, was a lament for a beloved, assassinatedleader, poisoned by the treacherous agents of British villainy.Soft as woman’s was your voice, O’Neill! Bright your eye,O! why did you leave us, Eoghan? Why did you die?Your troubles are all over, you’re at rest with God on high,But we’re slaves, and we’re orphans, Eoghan!—why did you die?Kennedy’s trip to his ancestral homeland was a celebration, but also a mourning.A melancholy note hovered over the ceremonial events, a sense of past and futureloss, even as Kennedy tried to keep spirits high. On his final day in Ireland,while bidding farewell to a crowd in Limerick, Kennedy promised that he wouldreturn “in the springtime”—the same promise made by millions of other youngIrish men and women as they left their dearest ones for distant shores.Kennedy’s days in Ireland were the happiest of his presidency. “The trip meantmore to him than any other in his life,” Jackie wrote to President de Valeraafter her husband’s death. “I will bring up my children to be as proud of beingIrish as he was. . . . Whenever they see anything beautiful or good, they say,‘That must be Irish.’”Jackie, who was pregnant at the time, had not been able to accompany JFK on thetrip. But she wrote to de Valera as if they were connected by blood, as if shehad known the old Irish leader for years. “I know we were all so blessed to havehim as long as we did,” she ended the letter, “but I will never understand whyGod had to take him now.”"},{"pageContent":"18 [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-42]THE BIG EVENT [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-42]Early in October 1963, Dulles sent Arthur Schlesinger a signed copy of his newbook, The Craft of Intelligence, to give to President Kennedy. Schlesinger foundthe inscription that Dulles had scrawled in the book “a little tepid.” By now,the White House historian clearly saw through what he later described asDulles’s “faux bonhomie.” But still committed to maintaining civil relationswith the CIA crowd, for his own good and that of the president, Schlesingertyped up an “agreeable” thank-you letter for Kennedy to send Dulles, ending withthe vaguely cheery words, “I hope you will stop by and see me before too long.”Looking over the letter before he signed it, JFK told Schlesinger, “That’s agood Rooseveltian line.” It had not occurred to Schlesinger before, but heimmediately realized Kennedy was right. The letter he had written to Dulles, forthe president’s signature, did indeed recall FDR, a master of the politebrush-off.Dulles’s book was published by his friend, Cass Canfield, the legendarypublisher of Harper & Row. Dulles spiced the book with a few colorful espionagetales, but it was essentially an argument for the kind of aggressiveintelligence establishment that he had built. He drew a dire picture of theespionage battlefield in the Cold War, where Soviet agents employed the darkesttools available to achieve victory, while their Western adversaries—hampered byoperating in open, democratic societies—were forced to play by more civilizedrules. The Soviet spy “has been fully indoctrinated” in the Communist principle“that the ends alone count and any means which achieve them are justified,”wrote Dulles. Meanwhile, he observed—taking another swing at the Kennedyphilosophy of peaceful coexistence—U.S. leaders shy from Soviet-styleruthlessness, “because of our desire to be ‘loved.’”There was a strange, looking-glass quality to The Craft of Intelligence. Many ofthe extreme measures he accused the Soviet espionage network of employing were,in fact, standard operating procedure at the CIA, including “secretassassination” as a political weapon. According to Dulles, the KGB (the Sovietspy agency) had built an “executive action” section to murder enemies of thestate. But this is precisely what Dulles himself had done within the CIA.Dulles also denounced another flagrant example of Soviet “cold-bloodedpragmatism”: the “massive recruitment” of Nazi war criminals “for intelligencework.” Coming from the man who salvaged Reinhard Gehlen and untold numbers ofother Hitler henchmen—and, in fact, helped build the West German intelligencesystem out of the poisoned remains of the Third Reich—the utter gall of thisstatement surely provoked howls of derision inside the Kremlin.Dulles was such a master of the “craft of intelligence” that he sometimesappeared to believe his own lies. In 1965, he sat for a remarkable interviewwith John Chancellor of NBC News for a TV special that was titled The Science ofSpying but was actually more concerned with the morality of the CIA. Chancellorspoke with Dulles in his Georgetown study, where the retired spymaster usuallydished out the artful hooey that was sopped up by the journalists whoperiodically sought him out. But Chancellor brought a more skeptical edge to hisconversation with Dulles than other reporters, and the Old Man was compelled tojustify himself more than usual. Did the CIA operate on a higher moral levelthan the KGB, Chancellor asked him? Certainly, Dulles replied. The Soviet spyagency was “one of the most sinister organizations ever organized. . . . As faras I know, we don’t engage in assassinations or kidnappings or things of thatkind. As far as I know, we never have.”So, Chancellor continued, did Dulles himself adhere to “moral standards” when hewas director of the CIA? Dulles paused briefly, and a calculating look came overhis face. Then he leaned confidently into the camera. “Yes, I did—and why?Because I don’t think—given the caliber of the men and women I had working forme—I didn’t want to ask them to do a thing that I wouldn’t do.” As if readingChancellor’s mind, Dulles felt compelled to further defend his personal sense ofmorality. “All I can say,” he went on, “is . . . that . . . ah . . . I was aparson’s son, and I was brought up as a Presbyterian. Maybe as a Calvinist—maybethat made me a fatalist, I don’t know. But I hope I had a reasonable moralstandard.”On occasion, Dulles did give journalists glimpses of the darker truth about theCIA, only to quickly pull the wool over their eyes. When Washington columnistAndrew Tully interviewed Dulles for his 1962 book, which promised the “insidestory” on the CIA, he asked the espionage legend what his organization would doif a foreign agent threatened the security of the United States. “We’d killhim,” Dulles replied matter-of-factly. But then his face resumed its genialexpression, and he assured Tully that his question was hypothetical and that he“could not possibly conceive” of such an unpleasant scenario actually occurring.When Cass Canfield asked Dulles to write a book drawing on his long career as aspook, Dulles was initially noncommittal, telling the publisher, “First of all,I shall have to persuade myself that I have the aptitude and the skills to doeffective writing, as I am not much of a believer in ‘ghosts.’” It was anotherless than truthful statement, for Dulles always relied on others, including CIAemployees and media assets, to write his books, magazine articles, and speeches.Despite Dulles’s retirement status, The Craft of Intelligence was an agencyenterprise, drawing on the writing skills of Howard Hunt, Howard Roman, andfriendly Fortune magazine reporter Charles Murphy, as well as the research andediting skills of top CIA analyst Sherman Kent and Dulles’s former right-handman Frank Wisner, whose career came to an end in 1962 because of deepeningmental problems. Dulles also drew on his extensive academic contacts for help,including W. Glenn Campbell at Stanford’s Hoover Institution, who provided readyaccess to his extensive files on the Communist threat. Kent also suggested thatDulles “use your potent association with Princeton to good effect” and “con”Joseph Strayer, the longtime chair of Princeton’s history department, intodrafting the section of Dulles’s book dealing with the medieval roots ofespionage.Dulles was so deeply connected in the media world that the critical response toThe Craft of Intelligence was all but assured when it was published in the fallof 1963. The Washington Post heralded what amounted to little more than apredictable Cold War screed as “one of the most fascinating books of our time.”The New York Times’s critic found a clever way to celebrate a book that revealedvery little of Dulles’s actual spy craft, praising his “brilliantly selectivecandor.” The Times review provided other blurb-worthy quotes for the book,declaring, “There is material enough here on breathlessly high-level sleutheryto keep Helen MacInnes and Ian Fleming busy writing all kinds of thrillers”—anabsurdly exaggerated comment, considering the book’s calculatedly tame contents.Dulles had enjoyed a warm relationship with New York Times executives andeditors for many years. When Dulles was named CIA director, Times generalmanager Julius Ochs Adler—“Julie,” as Dulles affectionately called him—warmlycongratulated his friend “Allie.” The Times executive told Dulles that hisappointment was “the best news I have read in a long time.”If Dulles needed any assurance that he continued to be a power player after heleft the CIA, the publication of The Craft of Intelligence delivered it. Hailedby the leading publications, the book became an immediate bestseller and won himspeaking invitations before influential audiences up and down the EasternSeaboard, as well as in California. Dulles was also invited to appear in Texas,where, between October 25 and 29, he met with old friends in Houston and Dallasand spoke before the Dallas Council on World Affairs.Dulles often used speaking engagements and vacations as covers for seriousbusiness, and his detour through Texas bears the markings of such a stratagem.His stopover in Texas stood out as an anomaly in a book tour otherwise dominatedby appearances on the two coasts. The spymaster’s date book during his Texastrip typically left out as much as it revealed, with big gaps in his schedulethroughout his stay there. But Dulles was wired into the Texas oil industry—forwhich his law firm, Sullivan and Cromwell, had provided legal counsel for manyyears—as well as into the local political hierarchy, including Dallas mayorEarle Cabell, the younger brother of his former CIA deputy, Charles, a fellowvictim of JFK’s post–Bay of Pigs housecleaning. With Kennedy’s trip to Texasjust weeks away, the president was a hot topic in these local circles.Dulles’s strongly critical views of the Kennedy presidency were ardently sharedby the men in his Texas milieu, where JFK was widely viewed as a dangerouslyweak leader. E. M. (Ted) Dealey, the reactionary publisher of The Dallas MorningNews, thought so little of Kennedy that he once berated him at a White Houseluncheon, in front of a group of visiting Texas publishers. “We can annihilateRussia and should make that clear to the Soviet government,” Dealey lecturedKennedy. “The general opinion of the grassroots thinking in this country is thatyou and your administration are weak sisters. We need a man on a horseback tolead this nation, and many people in Texas and the Southwest think that you areriding [your daughter] Caroline’s tricycle.”The cool-tempered Kennedy did not let his anger flash in public gatherings. Buthe fixed Dealey—the man whose family name was on the plaza where he woulddie—with a hard look. “The difference between you and me, Mr. Dealey,” repliedKennedy in his chilliest Boston staccato, “is that I was elected president ofthis country and you were not. I have the responsibility for the lives of 180million Americans, which you have not. . . . Wars are easier to talk about thanthey are to fight. I’m just as tough as you are—and I didn’t get electedpresident by arriving at soft judgments.”The Texas oil crowd was also furious at Kennedy for moving to close their taxloopholes, particularly the oil depletion allowance, which threatened to costthe oilmen millions—perhaps billions—of dollars a year. This kind of governmentmischief would have been unthinkable during the Eisenhower-Dulles years. As vicepresident, Lyndon Johnson—Texas’s native son—was supposed to make sure that theman in the White House didn’t mess with their wealth. But by the fall of 1963,the once-powerful LBJ—former Senate majority leader and master of the backroomdeal—was a fading figure in Washington, unable to take care of the oil tycoonswho had paved his way to power. “He had promised to protect them,” saidpetroleum industry lawyer Ed Clark, “and he couldn’t deliver. He couldn’tdeliver!”JFK had put Johnson on his 1960 ticket to win votes in the South. But, as the1964 campaign approached, LBJ had lost so much clout below the Mason-DixonLine—largely because of his subservient role in Kennedy’s liberal, pro–civilrights presidency—that he couldn’t even be counted on to deliver his home state.With the South looming like a lost cause for Kennedy, it was becoming more andmore important to lock up states in the North and the West that he had lost toNixon in 1960. Johnson began to seem like less of an attractive running matethan someone like Governor Pat Brown of California. On November 13, 1963, whenKennedy convened his first important strategy meeting for the ’64 race at theWhite House, neither Johnson nor any of his staff were invited. The increasinglypanicked vice president took it as one more sign that the Kennedys weremaneuvering to dump him from the upcoming Democratic ticket.If the Kennedys were indeed looking to get rid of Johnson, they were given theperfect opportunity by a growing Washington scandal that fall involving BobbyBaker, the Senate majority secretary who had long served as LBJ’s influencepeddler, shakedown artist, errand boy, and pimp. In September, lurid storiesabout Baker’s wide network of corruption began appearing in the press—includingthe campaign slush fund and Capitol Hill “party houses,” stocked with buxomyoung call girls who catered to every sexual whim, with which Baker bought theloyalty of Washington politicians. The titillating exposés soon led to Johnson,whom every capital insider knew was Baker’s puppeteer. Baker, who was referredto as Johnson’s “protégé” and “little Lyndon” in the press, resigned from hisSenate office as the scandal intensified, hoping to protect the man he slavishlyadmired as “The Leader.” But the heat under Johnson only grew, and the vicepresident was convinced that it was his longtime tormentor, Bobby Kennedy, whowas stoking the flames by quietly feeding damaging information to the press.Lyndon Johnson had entered the 1960 Democratic presidential sweepstakes withcocky self-assurance. He had run the U.S. Senate like it was his personalfiefdom from the moment he took over as majority leader in 1955. He was hisparty’s mover and shaker, the biggest wolf in the 1960 Democratic pack, and hefelt confident that the nomination was his for the taking. Even as the Kennedycampaign—under Bobby’s wily management—outmaneuvered him at the DemocraticConvention in Los Angeles that July, LBJ vowed not to give in and accept thevice presidential position. “Hand on heart,” Johnson told his friends in LosAngeles, the omnipresent Henry and Clare Boothe Luce, “I wouldn’t be on [JFK’s]team if he got down on his knees.”Months later, on the VIP bus to Kennedy’s Inaugural Ball, Clare found herselfseated next to Johnson, and she teased him about taking the number two spot.“Come clean, Lyndon,” she smiled wickedly. What did it feel like for theswaggering Texan to be in the rear position? The big man leaned close andwhispered, “Clare, I looked it up. One out of every four presidents has died inoffice. I’m a gamblin’ man, darlin’, and this is the only one chance I got.” Itwas another example of LBJ’s coarse humor. But it also revealed something darkerin the man. He undoubtedly was keenly aware of the presidential mortality rate.By 1963, however, it was Johnson who was the ghost, a once commanding figurewhose future grew dimmer by the day—and he knew it. In March, Susan Mary Alsop,Joe’s convenient wife, told Schlesinger that LBJ had unburdened himself to herhusband, while the columnist was dining “a trois with Lyndon and Ladybird.”According to Alsop’s wife, “Lyndon had been very dark and bitter about hisfrustrations and his prospects.” After recounting the confessional dinner in hisjournal, Schlesinger added his own observation about Johnson: “He really hasfaded astonishingly into the background and wanders unhappily around, a spectraland premature elder statesman.” Johnson began to even physically fade as themonths went by, losing so much weight that his suits hung loosely off hisshoulders and his eyes seemed to sink inside their sockets.In January 1963, after listening to Bobby Kennedy deliver an inspiring speech atthe National Archives celebrating the centennial of the EmancipationProclamation, civil rights lawyer Joe Rauh passed Schlesinger a note. “PoorLyndon,” it said. When Schlesinger asked him what he meant, Rauh, a stalwart ofthe Democratic Party’s left wing, said, “Lyndon must know he is through. Bobbyis going to be the next president.”The Kennedys had turned the swaggering Johnson into a useless figure. LBJ usedone of his memorable barnyard metaphors to describe his plight. “Being vicepresident is like being a cut dog,” he told his old mentor, former Speaker ofthe House Sam Rayburn. He knew that he was the odd man out in the glamorous, IvyLeague–groomed world of the New Frontier. “They’re trying to make a hick out ofme,” he complained to The New York Times’s Scotty Reston. And, as usual, hefocused his resentment on Bobby Kennedy, whom he blamed—not without reason—forisolating and diminishing him. “Bobby symbolized everything Johnson hated,”observed Kennedy aide Richard Goodwin, who later worked in the Johnson WhiteHouse. “He became the symbol of all the things Johnson wasn’t . . . with thesecharacteristics of wealth and power and ease and Eastern elegance; with Johnsonalways looking at himself as the guy they thought was illiterate, rude, crude.They laughed at him behind his back. I think he felt all that.”It was a mortifying position for Lyndon Johnson—a pathologically ambitious man,with an ego that was as mountainous as it was fragile—to find himself in. Andyet, it was only to get worse for the vice president as Kennedy prepared tovisit Johnson’s home state in November. On November 14, the day after the WhiteHouse strategy session on the 1964 campaign, the president privately confirmedthat Johnson would not be on the ticket, while conversing with his secretary,Evelyn Lincoln. JFK told her that he was planning major government reformsduring his second term, and to accomplish this ambitious agenda he needed a vicepresident “who believes as I do.” Kennedy told Lincoln that he was leaningtoward Terry Sanford, the young, moderate governor of swing state NorthCarolina. “But it will not be Lyndon,” he said.Dick Nixon, who had weathered his own “dump Nixon” movement as Eisenhower’s 1956reelection campaign drew near, was keenly attuned to Johnson’s growinghumiliation. Nixon was the first major national figure to voice Johnson’sagonizing fear—and with typical cunning, he chose to do it in LBJ’s backyard.Nixon showed up in Dallas on November 21, 1963, the day before JFK’spresidential party was due to arrive in the city. Nixon was there on business—toattend a meeting of the Pepsi-Cola Company, a client of his New York lawfirm—but he was happy to roil the political waters by sharing hisprognostications with the local press. Lyndon Johnson had become a “politicalliability,” Nixon told Texas reporters, and if the upcoming presidential racelooked close, he predicted that Kennedy would not hesitate to drop him.Nixon’s prediction, which was prominently displayed in The Dallas Morning Newson November 22, was another blow to LBJ’s ego. But he had even bigger concerns.Later that morning, a Life investigative team was scheduled to convene in themagazine’s New York offices, to begin work on a deeper probe of Johnson’sinvolvement in the Bobby Baker corruption scandal. William Lambert, theinvestigative unit’s leader, was certain they were sitting on an explosive storythat could bring down the vice president. “This guy looks like a bandit to me,”he told his boss, Life managing editor George Hunt. LBJ, he told Hunt, had usedpublic office to amass a fortune, shaking down political favor-seekers for cashand consumer goods, even putting the squeeze on an insurance executive for anexpensive Magnavox stereo console that Lady Bird coveted. As Bobby Baker latercommented, Johnson was “always on the lookout for the odd nickel or dime.” Infact, that insurance executive—Don Reynolds—was scheduled to testify aboutJohnson’s tawdry influence-peddling practices at another meeting on November 22,in a closed session of the Senate Rules Committee. The two meetings—one in NewYork, one in Washington—would have likely determined the political fate ofLyndon Baines Johnson, had they not been overshadowed by events in Dallas thatday.Lyndon Johnson’s days might have been numbered as vice president, but he was notentirely abandoned in Washington. If LBJ was rapidly losing favor within theKennedy administration, he had managed to retain the support of many key figuresin the national security arena. Johnson had long been the dominant politicalfigure in a state with a booming defense and aerospace industry, and he had longcultivated ties to generals and espionage officials.At the very beginning of Kennedy’s presidency, Johnson made a strange powergrab, trying to get JFK to grant him extraordinary supervisory powers over thecountry’s entire national security apparatus, including the Defense Department,CIA, State Department, and the Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization. Kennedydid not even bother responding to Johnson’s maneuver, simply ignoring theexecutive order and accompanying letter that LBJ sent over to the Oval Officefor his signature. But Johnson’s “executive order” power play was neverforgotten in the White House. Even a friend of LBJ—longtime Democraticpresidential adviser Jim Rowe—was “flabbergasted” after Johnson showed him theproposed order, calling it, “frankly, the most presumptuous document any VicePresident had ever sent to his President.” Despite the White House rebuff, LBJcontinued to enjoy a special bond with national security hard-liners duringKennedy’s reign, often embracing their aggressive positions on Cuba and otherhot spots, as well as leaking inside information about White House policydevelopments to his contacts at the Pentagon and CIA.Dulles was among those who maintained warm relations with the vice president,even as both men’s stars fell within the Kennedy court. In retirement, thespymaster continued to invite Johnson to Washington functions. And, in thesummer of 1963, Johnson hosted Dulles at his ranch in the Texas Hill Country,sixty miles west of Austin. Dulles’s visit to the LBJ Ranch did not appear inhis calendar, but it was briefly noted in a syndicated news photo, whichappeared in the Chicago Tribune on August 15, that showed the vice presidentastride a horse, while a beaming Lady Bird and Dulles looked on. Considering howestranged both men were from Kennedy—and how notoriously conniving they were—thepicture could only have produced a sense of puzzlement in the White House.Those resolute voices in American public life that continue to deny theexistence of a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy argue that “someone wouldhave talked.” This line of reasoning is often used by journalists who have madeno effort themselves to closely inspect the growing body of evidence and havenot undertaken any of their own investigative reporting. The argument betrays atouchingly naïve media bias—a belief that the American press establishmentitself, that great slumbering watchdog, could be counted on to solve such amonumental crime, one that sprung from the very system of governance of whichcorporate media is an essential part. The official version of the Kennedyassassination—despite its myriad improbabilities, which have only grown moreinconceivable with time—remains firmly embedded in the media consciousness, asunquestioned as the law of gravity.In fact, many people have talked during the past half of a century—includingsome directly connected to the plot against Kennedy. But the media simplyrefused to listen. One of the most intriguing examples of someone talkingoccurred in 2003, when an old and ailing Howard Hunt began unburdening himselfto his eldest son, Saint John.“Saint,” as his father called him, was a loyal and loving son, who had sufferedthrough the upheavals of the spy’s life, along with the rest of his family. Lateone night in June 1972, at the family’s Witches Island home in suburbanMaryland, Hunt had frantically woken up his eighteen-year-old son. “I need youto do exactly as I say, and not ask any questions!” said Hunt, who was in asweaty and disheveled state that his son had never before witnessed. He orderedSaint John to fetch window cleaner, rags, and rubber gloves from the kitchen andto help him rub away fingerprints from a pile of espionage equipment, includingcameras, microphones, and walkie-talkies. Later, Saint helped his father stuffthe equipment into two suitcases, which they loaded into the trunk of hisfather’s Pontiac Firebird. Hunt and his son drove through the darkness to theChesapeake and Ohio Canal, where the spook got out and tossed the suitcases intothe murky water. On the way back home, Hunt told Saint that he had been doingsome special work for the White House, and things had gone south.It was the beginning of the Watergate drama, in which Howard Hunt played astarring role as the leader of the “White House plumbers,” the five burglars whowere arrested while breaking into the Democratic Party’s national headquarters.All five of the men had a long history with Hunt, dating back to the earliestdays of the underground war against Castro, and at least two—Frank Sturgis andVirgilio Gonzalez—were rumored to have played roles in the Kennedyassassination.As the Watergate scandal unfolded, Hunt drew Saint and the rest of his familydeeper into his disintegrating life. Saint’s beloved mother, Dorothy—an exoticbeauty with her own espionage background—would die in a plane crash in the midstof the Watergate crisis, while serving as a mysterious courier for her husband.When her United Airlines flight from Washington’s Dulles Airport crashed whilelanding at Chicago’s Midway Airport in December 1972, Dorothy Hunt was carryingover $2 million in cash and money orders, some of which was later traced toPresident Nixon’s reelection campaign.As Nixon frantically tried to cover his tracks in the widening scandal, sketchymoney began flowing back and forth. The president was desperate to keep Huntquiet and during one White House meeting, Nixon—caught on his secret tapingsystem—figured it would cost “a million in cash. We could get our hands on thatkind of money.” Hunt felt that Nixon owed him and his team. “I had five menwhose families needed to be supported,” Hunt later said. “And I had a big house,stalls for six horses, kids in private school—I had needs for contributions thatwere greater than the average person’s. . . . There’s a long tradition that whena warrior is captured, the commanding officer takes care of his family.”Nixon knew that Howard Hunt had played key roles in some of America’s darkestmysteries. On June 23, 1972—while discussing the Watergate break-in with H. R.Haldeman, his devoted political deputy and White House chief of staff—Nixon wastaped saying, “Hunt . . . will uncover a lot of things. You open that scab,there’s a hell of a lot of things. . . . This involves these Cubans, Hunt and alot of hanky-panky that we have nothing to do with ourselves.”Nixon wanted Haldeman to lean on Dick Helms, who was then CIA director, bywarning him that if the spy agency did not help shut down the growing Watergatescandal, “[t]he President’s belief is that this is going to open up that wholeBay of Pigs thing . . . and it’s going to make the CIA look bad, it’s going tomake Hunt look bad, and is likely to blow the whole Bay of Pigs thing . . . andwe think it would be very unfortunate for the CIA and for the country at thistime.”Nixon’s ploy did not work. When Haldeman sat Helms down in his office anddelivered the president’s thinly veiled threat about “the Bay of Pigs thing,”the normally icy-cool Helms exploded. “The Bay of Pigs had nothing to do withthis!” he shouted. Nixon only succeeded in further antagonizing a very powerfulWashington institution, one capable of far more deviousness than even he was.What did Nixon mean by “the whole Bay of Pigs thing”? According to Haldeman, itwas Nixon’s way of referring to the unspeakable—the Kennedy assassination. Otherhistorians have speculated that it was shorthand for the CIA-Mafia plots againstCastro. In any case, “the Bay of Pigs thing” was an apt code name—it conjuredall the swampy intrigue that began leaching through the Kennedy administrationafter Allen Dulles and his agency suffered their humiliation in Cuba, everythingthe CIA wanted to keep deeply hidden. And Howard Hunt was knee-deep in much ofthis muck.Hunt’s adventures in the spy trade eventually tore apart his family and sent himto federal prison for nearly three years. By 2003, the retired spy was living ina modest ranch house in north Miami with his second wife, Laura, who wastwenty-seven years younger. She had fallen for him while watching him give aprison interview on Watergate. “I liked all those men—that must seem strange toyou,” Laura Hunt told a Miami Herald reporter. “Not for what he’d done—I don’tadmire that—but I admired him for serving the government, and I admired hisintellect.”At eighty-four, Hunt seemed to be fading out, suffering from a variety ofmaladies, including hardening of the arteries, which had resulted in theamputation of his left leg and confined him to a wheelchair. He had a newfamily, including the two children he had with Laura. But Saint John Hunt feltit was time for his father to finally come clean for the sake of his firstfamily. Following years of estrangement, Saint began to spend time with hisfather, watching his favorite Fox News shows with him at his Miami house and,when the old man felt up to it, dredging up the past. Laura did not want SaintJohn to reopen this history, but he felt strongly that his father owed him thishonesty.After his family fell apart, Saint John had gone on the road as a rock musicianand drug peddler, a trip that eventually deposited him in the coastal redwoodsof northern California. But by the time he reunited with his father, Saint was asober, middle-aged, law-abiding citizen who was eager to make sense of hisearlier life. He was particularly interested in talking with his father aboutthe Kennedy assassination—which he knew his father had long been linked to inconspiracy literature.Saint’s father had always insisted that he had nothing to do with Kennedy’sdeath, that he was at home in Washington the day of the assassination, not inDallas, as many JFK researchers alleged. Hunt claimed that he was shopping foringredients at a Chinese grocery store in Washington, to cook dinner that nightwith his wife, when the news bulletin about Kennedy came over the car radio. ButSaint, who was in the fifth grade at the time, had no memory of his father beinghome that day when he was let out early from school, or later that evening. Andhe found his father’s cover story about cooking the Chinese meal, which Hunttold under oath at a trial related to the Kennedy assassination, absurd. “I cantell you that’s the biggest load of crap in the world,” Saint John told RollingStone in 2007. “My dad in the kitchen? Chopping vegetables with his wife? I’m sosorry, but that would never happen. Ever.”His mother told Saint John, around the time of the assassination, that hisfather had indeed been in Dallas. The mystery of his father’s whereabouts thatday would prey on Saint for years. He was determined to engage his father on thesubject before it was too late.By 2003, Howard Hunt was ready to finally talk. He feared that his life wascoming to an end, and he was deeply regretful that he had so little to leave hisfamily after all they had endured. For a time, he flirted with the idea oftelling all to actor Kevin Costner, who had starred in Oliver Stone’s film JFK.Costner dangled a big financial reward in front of Hunt if he revealedeverything he knew about Dallas, but when the money never appeared, Hunt finallydismissed the actor as a “numbskull.” Saint John nonetheless urged his father tocontinue down the path of full disclosure while he was still of sound mind. Hemade his plea in a long letter to his father, telling him that it was time tofinally reveal what he knew—he “owed it,” wrote Saint, “to himself, the Nation,and his family to leave a legacy of truth instead of doubt.”Soon afterward, Hunt phoned his son in California and summoned him to Miami. OnDecember 7, 2003, Saint John Hunt flew to Florida—where so much of his father’ssecret life had unfolded—to hear his final testament.When he arrived at his father’s house, at the end of a cul-de-sac in theBiscayne Bay neighborhood, Saint found Hunt in bed, looking frail and washedout. But the old man perked up when he saw his son. He asked Saint to wheel himinto the TV room, where they shared some soup for lunch and watched an agitatedround of Fox News at the high volume required by the hard-of-hearing Hunt.Finally, Saint broached the subject that he had come to discuss. “Papa, can wetalk about my letter?”Hunt suggested that Saint wheel him back to his bedroom, in case his wifereturned. “We don’t want her getting upset by this,” Hunt told his son. “Shebelieves what I told her: that I don’t know anything about JFK’s murder.”“I think Laura’s very naïve about the darker side of politics,” said Saint John.“Well, that’s one of the reasons I love her so much,” his father replied.Then, after making Saint John promise he would never reveal what he was about totell him without his permission, Hunt launched into a remarkable story of theplot to kill John F. Kennedy. It was—even at this late date in Hunt’s life—stilla carefully parsed tale. He clearly was not telling everything he knew—and heseemed to be downplaying his own role in the crime as well as the complicity offormer CIA superiors to whom he remained loyal. He also couched much of hisnarrative in an oddly speculative manner, as if he were not fully certain of theexact configuration of the plot. Nonetheless, what Hunt did tell Saint John thatday was stunning enough. Over the following months, the spy elaborated on hisstory as his health occasionally improved. At one point, Saint brought in anexpert on the Kennedy assassination and Watergate—Eric Hamburg, a Los Angeleswriter-producer and a former aide to Senator John Kerry—to help videotapeinterviews with his father.Laura Hunt ultimately cut short her husband’s extraordinary journey of truthtelling with his son. But before Hunt died in 2007, he left behind videointerviews, audiotapes, and notes in his own hand—as well as a somewhatrevealing memoir called American Spy. Hunt’s confessional trove amounts to atortured effort to reveal what he knew, while still guarding his family’ssensitivities, old professional loyalties, and whatever was left of his goodname. After his father died, Saint John would make a valiant effort to getHunt’s confessions—which should have been headline news—into the hands of themajor media gatekeepers. A 60 Minutes producer spent days poring over SaintJohn’s rich material, but he was finally forced to apologize that the story hadbeen spiked from above. In the end, only Rolling Stone—along with a scatteringof alternative media outlets—covered the story of Howard Hunt’s astonishingfinal statements about the crime of the century. Saint John’s own memoir of hisfather’s escapades and his family’s ordeal, Bond of Secrecy, was released by asmall Oregon publisher and received little promotion or attention.This was the story that Howard Hunt left behind. Sometime in 1963, Hunt said, hewas invited to a meeting at one of the CIA safe houses in Miami by FrankSturgis, a soldier of fortune who had worked under Hunt in the anti-Castrounderground—a man with whom Hunt would be forever linked when they were laterarrested for the Watergate break-in. Also in attendance at the Miami meeting wasDavid Morales, another CIA veteran of the anti-Castro campaign who was wellknown to Hunt. Morales—a big, intimidating man who had grown up in a poorMexican American family in Phoenix—did not fit the polished CIA profile. But theagency found a use for “El Indio”—as Morales, with his strong indigenousfeatures, was known by his colleagues.“Dave Morales did dirty work for the agency,” according to Wayne Smith, adiplomat who worked alongside Morales in the U.S. embassy in Havana beforeCastro took power. “If he were in the mob, he’d be called a hit man.”Thomas Clines, a colleague of Morales’s in the CIA’s Miami station, was morecomplimentary in his description, but it amounted to the same thing: “We alladmired the hell out of the guy. He drank like crazy, but he was bright as hell.He could fool people into thinking he was stupid by acting stupid, but he knewabout cultural things all over the world. People were afraid of him. He was bigand aggressive, and he had this mystique. Stories about him permeated theagency. If the agency needed someone action-oriented, he was at the top of thelist. If the U.S. government as a matter of policy needed someone or somethingneutralized, Dave would do it, including things that were repugnant to a lot ofpeople.”Ruben Carbajal, Morales’s lifelong friend from their boyhood days on the streetsof Phoenix, was even more blunt about “Didi”—the man who was like a brother tohim: “When some asshole needed to be killed, Didi was the man to do it. . . .That was his job.”According to Morales’s daughter, he was the CIA’s “peon.” Her father was utterlydevoted to the agency. “He did whatever he was told. They gave him a lifestylethat he would never have had under any circumstances. . . . He did everythingfor the Company. His family wasn’t his life—the Company was his life.”At the secret Miami meeting, Morales told Hunt that he had been recruited for an“off-the-board” operation by Bill Harvey, with whom El Indio had worked closelyon the ZR/Rifle project to kill Castro. The aim of this “off-the-board”operation, it soon became clear, was to assassinate President Kennedy. Moralesand Sturgis referred to the president’s planned demise as “the big event.”In his account of the meeting, Hunt presented Harvey and Morales as the keyoperational figures in the plot; Harvey did not attend the meeting but seemed toloom over it. Hunt suggested that Harvey was in charge of hiring thesharpshooters to kill Kennedy and transporting the weapons to Dallas. Accordingto Hunt, the gunmen were likely recruited from the Corsican underworld. AsHarvey once indicated, when it came to highly delicate assignments, working withCorsican gangsters was preferable because they were harder to trace back to theCIA than Italian or American Mafia hit men.Hunt found Harvey and Morales to be disturbing characters. The two men “couldhave been manufactured from the same cloth,” Hunt wrote in his memoir. “Bothwere hard-drinking, tough guys, possibly completely amoral. Morales was rumoredto be a cold-blooded killer, the go-to guy in black ops situations where thegovernment needed to have someone neutralized. I tried to cut short any contactwith him, as he wore thin very quickly.”To Morales, Kennedy was “that no good son of a bitch motherfucker” who wasresponsible for the deaths of the men he had trained for the Bay of Pigsmission. “We took care of that son of a bitch, didn’t we?” Morales told hisattorney, Robert Walton, in 1973, after an evening of drinking loosened the CIAhit man’s tongue. It was one more confession that the media ignored, even afterit was reported by one of their own, Gaeton Fonzi, a Philadelphia investigativejournalist who, after going to work for the House Select Committee onAssassinations, unearthed some of the most important information related to theKennedy case.Hunt might have been wary of men like Harvey and Morales, but he shared theirvenomous attitudes toward President Kennedy. Toward the end of the Miamimeeting, Sturgis made the group’s pitch to Hunt: “You’re somebody we all look upto. . . . We know how you feel about the man [Kennedy]. Are you with us?”Hunt told the group his main reservation about joining them. It was a tacticalconcern, not a moral one. “Look,” he told Sturgis, “if Bill Harvey has anythingto do with this, you can count me out. The man is an alcoholic and a psycho.”Sturgis laughed. “You’re right—but that SOB has the balls to do it.”As Hunt related his story to his son, he remained fuzzy about his owninvolvement in the plot. In the end, he said, he played only a peripheral“benchwarmer” role in the killing of Kennedy. It was Bill Harvey who was thequarterback, according to Hunt. Despite Harvey’s reputation for hard drinking,the agency’s assassination chief had the experience and connections to pull offsomething like “the big event.” While assembling his Castro assassination team,Harvey had reached out to a variety of underworld professionals, including (withHelms’s permission) the infamous European assassin code-named QJ-WIN, whom theCIA had recruited to kill Patrice Lumumba. And Harvey was well positioned asRome station chief to once again plumb the European underworld for a Dallaskilling team.In fact, among the strange and murderous characters who converged on Dallas inNovember 1963 was a notorious French OAS commando named Jean Souetre, who wasconnected to the plots against President de Gaulle. Souetre was arrested inDallas after the Kennedy assassination and expelled to Mexico. Souetre’sexpulsion brought an urgent inquiry from French intelligence officials to theCIA about the dangerous outlaw’s likely whereabouts, since de Gaulle was aboutto travel to Mexico for a state visit.Hunt’s speculations about the Kennedy conspiracy were in line with thesuspicions of the House Assassinations Committee. When the congressional inquirygot under way in 1976, the panel’s most energetic investigators zeroed in on theCIA’s anti-Castro operation as the nest from which the JFK plot had sprung—andBill Harvey soon emerged as a prime suspect.“We tried to get Harvey’s travel vouchers and security file from the CIA, but wewere never able to,” recalled Dan Hardway. Hardway was the bright Cornell LawSchool student to whom the congressional committee gave the weighty task ofinvestigating the CIA’s possible links to the assassination. “One CIA officialtold me, ‘So you’re from Congress—what the hell is that to us? You’ll be packedup and gone in a couple years, and we’ll still be here.’“But we did come across documents that suggested Harvey was traveling a lot inthe weeks leading up to the assassination, while he was supposed to be runningthe Rome station. . . . Near the end of our investigation, I typed up a memo,making my case against Harvey as a leading figure in the crime. I typed it up inthe committee’s secure room, on the yellow security paper with a purple bordermarked ‘Top Secret.’ That memo has since disappeared.”While the Miami conspirators made it clear that Bill Harvey was playing acentral role in “the big event,” they assured Hunt that the chain of commandwent much higher than Harvey. Vice President Johnson himself had signed off onthe plot, Morales insisted. Hunt found this plausible. As he observed in hismemoir, “Lyndon Johnson was an opportunist who would not hesitate to get rid ofany obstacles in his way.”Hunt was mindful of Washington’s strict “caste system,” but he was convincedthat “Harvey’s rank and position was such that a vice president could talk tohim.”This is where Hunt began to obfuscate. There is no evidence that Lyndon Johnsonand Bill Harvey were ever in close contact, and, in fact, the two men’s “rankand position” were disparate enough to make such communication unlikely. It issimply not credible that a man in Johnson’s position would have discussedsomething as extraordinarily sensitive as the removal of the president with aman who occupied Harvey’s place in the national security hierarchy.The man Johnson did know best in the intelligence world was Allen Dulles. UnlikeHarvey, Dulles had the stature and the clout to assure a man like LBJ that theplot had the high-level support it needed to be successful.Howard Hunt was fully aware of the seating arrangements at the Washington powertable. He knew, in fact, that Dulles outranked Johnson in this rarefied circle.Hunt undoubtedly realized that the vice president might be a passive accessory,or even an active accomplice, in what would be the crime of the century. ButJohnson was certainly not the mastermind. And yet, loyal to the end, even on hisdeathbed Hunt could not bring himself to name Dulles—that “remarkable man,” asHunt once gushed, whom it had been his “honor” to serve.In his memoir, Hunt engaged in a kind of sleight of hand, hypothesizing aboutthe likely identities of the conspirators, as if he didn’t know for certain. Butin his communications with Saint John, Hunt was more emphatic about theplotters. In addition to Harvey and Morales, the names David Atlee Phillips andCord Meyer figured prominently in Hunt’s “speculations.”Phillips was the CIA counterintelligence specialist who had worked closely withHunt on the Guatemala coup and the Bay of Pigs invasion. Like Harvey andMorales, Phillips did not belong to the Ivy League elite. The Texas-born,roughly handsome, chain-smoking Phillips had been a nose gunner during World WarII, not an OSS gentleman spy. After the war, he rambled around Latin America,trying his hand at acting and publishing before being recruited into the CIA.His covert work won the admiration of Helms, who made him chief of the agency’sCuba operations after Harvey was whisked off to Rome to escape Bobby Kennedy’swrath. In that position, Phillips was free to roam within the “yeasty” world ofanti-Castro and anti-Kennedy ferment, as Senator Gary Hart later described it.Meyer belonged to the agency’s Georgetown set. At Yale, he had dreamed of awriting career and—after returning from the war in the South Pacific, partlyblinded by a Japanese grenade—he devoted himself for a time to the cause ofworld peace. But after he was initiated into the spy fraternity—where he fellunder the spell of Jim Angleton—he became chief of the CIA’s culture war,secretly dispersing cash to the literary types whose ranks he once imaginedjoining. After his beautiful, artistic wife, Mary, left him, Meyer became anincreasingly embittered Cold Warrior—and his disposition grew only gloomier whenshe became a mistress of JFK.Hunt carefully refrained from naming Dulles in his confessions, but nearly everyCIA official whom he implicated led directly to the Old Man. Dulles hadrecruited them or promoted them or given them the agency’s most delicateassignments. Meyer was particularly beholden to Dulles, who had saved his careerin 1953, when Joe McCarthy tried to purge the agency of those agents who hadonce been youthful idealists. In the fall of 1963, during the weeks leading upto the Kennedy assassination, Meyer was a guest at Dulles’s home on more thanone occasion—along with another important member of Angleton’s shop, Jim Hunt(no relation to Howard), and Angleton himself.Howard Hunt might have been wary about joining a JFK plot managed by BillHarvey. But if he knew that Allen Dulles was at the top of the chain of command,that would have instilled in him all the confidence he needed. Despite hiscoyness about his own role, some felt that Hunt had been much more than a“benchwarmer.” At one point, the CIA itself seemed poised to make Hunt the fallguy in the crime. In the 1970s, as congressional investigators incheduncomfortably close to some of the CIA’s most disturbing secrets, Hunt’s owncolleagues seriously considered throwing him to the wolves.In August 1978, as the House Select Committee on Assassinations entered thefinal stage of its probe, a former CIA official named Victor Marchetti publishedan eye-opening article in The Spotlight, a magazine put out by the right-wingLiberty Lobby whose pages often reflected the noxious views of the group’seccentric founder, Willis Carto. Marchetti wrote that CIA officials had decidedthat if the assassinations committee crept too close to the truth, the agencywas prepared to scapegoat Hunt and some of his sidekicks, such as Sturgis.“[Hunt’s] luck has run out, and the CIA has decided to sacrifice him to protectits clandestine services,” Marchetti wrote. “The agency is furious with Hunt forhaving dragged it publicly into the Nixon mess and for having blackmailed itafter he was arrested. Besides, Hunt is vulnerable—an easy target as they say inthe spy business. His reputation and integrity have been destroyed. . . . In thepublic hearings, the CIA will ‘admit’ that Hunt was involved in the conspiracyto kill Kennedy. The CIA may go so far as to ‘admit’ that there were threegunmen shooting at Kennedy.”Marchetti described this CIA plan as a classic “limited hangout” strategy—spyjargon for releasing some of the hidden facts, in order to distract the publicfrom bigger, more explosive information. While The Spotlight was a sketchypublication, Marchetti himself had credibility. A former Soviet militaryspecialist for the CIA, he had risen to become a special assistant to Helmsbefore resigning in 1969 over disagreements with agency policy. In 1973,Marchetti wrote a critique of the agency, The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence,which the agency forced his publisher, Alfred A. Knopf, to heavily censor. ButMarchetti remained a CIA loyalist at heart, and he retained strong ties to theagency.In the ensuing uproar over the Spotlight article, Hunt sued for defamation ofcharacter, insisting that he had nothing to do with the Kennedy assassination,but he ultimately lost his court case. The Liberty Lobby’s attorney, famed JFKresearcher Mark Lane, succeeded in convincing the jury that Hunt might indeedhave been in Dallas, as his own son came to believe.During the trial, Lane uncovered the surprising identities of Marchetti’ssources: Jim Angleton and William Corson, a former Marine officer who had servedwith Dulles’s son in Korea and later worked for the spymaster. Marchetti wasclearly a conduit for the deep rumblings from within Langley. His article was afascinating window into the CIA’s organizational psychology during a period ofthe agency’s greatest distress.Marchetti himself was troubled by the unanswered questions swirling around theKennedy assassination. “This is a thing in my mind that is not 100 percentcertain—there is that two to three percent that remains open,” he said. And muchof Marchetti’s suspicion focused on Hunt. “He might have been down there [inDallas] for some other reason, but . . . who knows?” Some of the evidence aboutHunt that came out during the Liberty Lobby trial, added Marchetti, “was justvery, very strange.”As the CIA prepared its “limited hangout” strategy on the Kennedy assassination,Hunt was not the only officer considered “expendable” by the agency. BillHarvey, too, felt that he was being hung out to dry when he was subpoenaed bythe Church Committee to testify about the CIA’s assassination plots againstforeign leaders. Word circulated in Washington that Harvey had gone “rogue.”Like Kurtz in Heart of Darkness, it was whispered, he had gone off the railsduring his exploits in the espionage wilderness—his thinking had become unsound.Harvey was very familiar with the CIA’s character assassination machinery, andhe now found himself a target of it: he had never been one of the Fifth Avenuecowboys, and now they were turning on him. Long after he was gone, Harvey’sfamily still resented the CIA high command for how they had treated him. They“threw him under the bus,” in the words of his daughter, Sally.Harvey’s widow, CG, was bitterly aware of the CIA class system. “Bill always hadvery good opportunities for travel and learning,” she said, still defending herlate husband against the agency prejudices. “And for these people to turn uptheir noses and say that Bill was from nothing, just because he graduated in lawschool at Indiana University, always made me feel that they were jealous andthat they really couldn’t carry his briefcase when it came to intelligence. . .. Bill gave his life to his country.”All the stories that came spilling out of the agency about Harvey’s wildways—his love of guns, his fondness for birdbath-size martinis, his eruptions ofblack fury at the Kennedys—they were all meant to show that he was the type whocould blow his top and do anything. But Harvey’s consistently glowing CIAfitness reports tell a different story. There was nothing rogue about BillHarvey in these pages—he was portrayed as a dedicated and highly valuedprofessional. Even after Harvey had enraged Bobby Kennedy with his Cuban antics,he continued to win enthusiastic reviews from his superiors. “It is difficult toprepare a fitness report on this outstanding officer, largely because forms donot lend themselves to measuring his many unique characteristics,” beganHarvey’s October 1962 report, which cited his “professional knowledge . . .toughness of mind and firmness of attitude.” Harvey, the report concluded, “isone of the few distinctly outstanding officers” in the CIA’s action arm.Likewise, after the violently inclined Harvey alarmed F. Mark Wyatt, his Romedeputy, so severely that Wyatt asked to be transferred home, Harvey’sperformance continued to be rated “outstanding” by agency officials. Harvey’sMarch 1965 report commended “his determination to accomplish his basicobjectives regardless of the obstacles which he encounters.” The Rome station“must be guided with a strong hand,” the report continued, “which Mr. Harvey iswell able to supply.” Dick Helms had sent Wyatt to Rome to help keep an eye onHarvey. But when Wyatt was recalled to Langley and told Helms about the extrememethods that Harvey was employing in Rome, the CIA did nothing to disciplineHarvey. Instead, it was Wyatt who found his career stalled.Harvey always vehemently denied that he was a reckless maverick. Testifyingbefore the Church Committee, he insisted that he had never done anything thatwas “unauthorized, freewheeling or in any way outside the framework of myresponsibilities and duties as an officer of the agency.” The truly alarmingthing is that Harvey was probably telling the truth. But the men who hadauthorized his extreme actions were quite willing for him to take the blame.Like Hunt, he was “an easy target” for the spymasters.Bill Harvey and Howard Hunt both prided themselves on being part of the CIA’supper tier. But that’s not how these men were viewed at the top of the agency.Hunt liked to brag that he had family connections to Wild Bill Donovan himself,who had admitted him into the OSS, the original roundtable of Americanintelligence. But it turned out that Hunt’s father was a lobbyist in upstate NewYork to whom Donovan owed a favor, not a fellow Wall Street lawyer. Everyoneknew Hunt was a writer, but they also knew he was no Ian Fleming.Hunt didn’t figure out how these men really saw him until it was much too late.“I thought—mistakenly—that I was dealing with honorable men,” he said near theend of his life.To the Georgetown set, there would always be something low-rent about men likeHunt—as well as Harvey and Morales. The CIA was a cold hierarchy. Men like thiswould never be invited for lunch with Dulles at the Alibi Club or to play tenniswith Dick Helms at the Chevy Chase Club. These men were indispensable—until theybecame expendable.Hunt, Harvey, and Morales were among the expendable men sent to Dallas inNovember 1963. But the most expendable of all was a young ex-marine with aperplexing past named Lee Harvey Oswald."},{"pageContent":"19 [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-44]THE FINGERPRINTS OF INTELLIGENCE [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-44]Lee Harvey Oswald was one of those bright, lost, fatherless boys whom societyfinds inventive ways of abusing. He never knew his father, Robert, who died of aheart attack before he was born. His mother, Marguerite, suffered from ahigh-strung disposition and was ill equipped to take care of her three sons.When Lee was three years old, his mother placed him in a New Orleans orphanageknown as the Bethlehem Children’s Home, where his two older brothers alreadyresided. Some of the children there fell prey to predatory members of the staff,and Lee was said to have witnessed scenes of sexual exploitation at a tenderage. Marguerite withdrew Lee from Bethlehem after a year, and his two brotherscame home several months later. But life in the Oswald family continued on aturbulent course, as Marguerite married for a third time and divorced, put herolder sons in a Mississippi military school, and moved with Lee to Forth Worth.When Lee’s older brothers fled the domestic chaos and enlisted in the military,he was left adrift with his permanently unsettled mother.In the summer of 1952, when Lee was nearly thirteen, Marguerite packed up thetwo of them and headed to New York, where they moved in with her oldest son,John, who was now married and living in an apartment on the Upper East Side.Life was no more stable for Lee in New York, and he often cut class, riding thesubways and roaming the streets. Arrested for chronic truancy, Oswald wasconfined for three weeks in the city’s Youth House for psychiatric evaluation.Dr. Renatus Hartogs, a German-trained physician who was chief psychiatrist atYouth House, found the intelligent and free-floating Oswald to be such aninteresting case that he made the thirteen-year-old the subject of one of hisseminars. Hartogs’s psychiatric profile of Oswald—which he would reprise for theWarren Commission a decade later—created the pathological framework by which thealleged assassin would be known for many years to come. Oswald, according toHartogs, was an “emotionally disturbed, mentally constricted youngster” who was“suspicious and defiant in his attitude toward authority.” While a probationofficer had found Lee to be a “small, bright and likable boy” with a reasonableexplanation for his truancy—he thought school was “a waste of time” and “theother children made fun of him because of his Texas drawl and his bluejeans”—Hartogs saw Oswald as a walking time bomb. The only reason he had not“acted upon his hostility in an aggressive or destructive fashion” was that hehad not yet “developed the courage.”Hartogs himself was a curious case, one of those intrepid explorers of the humanmind who—with government encouragement and funding—had been willing to go to thescientific fringes. His résumé included a stint at Montreal’s Allan MemorialInstitute, where Dr. Ewen Cameron conducted his diabolical “Sleep Room”experiments. Hartogs went on to work with Dr. Sidney Malitz of the New YorkState Psychiatric Institute, which received funding from the Army Chemical Corpsand the CIA to conduct drug experiments on unsuspecting patients involving LSDand mescaline. Later, after Hartogs was drummed out of psychiatry by asensational sex scandal, he turned himself into a hypnosis expert.Young Oswald had a searching mind. After the teenager was handed a pamphlet on aNew York street corner about Julius and Ethel Rosenberg—the spies condemned todeath for passing atomic secrets to the Russians—he was moved to learn aboutCommunism, forcing himself to read the heavy Germanic prose of Karl Marx. Oswalddreamed of an exciting world beyond the cramped hysteria of life withMarguerite—where he could make himself into whomever he wanted to be. I LedThree Lives was his favorite TV show—the serial based on the true story ofHerbert Philbrick, the mild-mannered Boston advertising executive who had turnedhimself into an undercover agent for the FBI. The multilayered secrecy ofPhilbrick’s life resonated with the boy who yearned to escape the drabone-dimensionality of his own. But ignored at home, and left to fend forhimself, Lee’s dreams only made him a soft target. As the teenaged Oswaldventured into the world, he was a mooncalf waiting to be exploited.After returning to New Orleans with his mother in 1954, the fifteen-year-oldOswald hooked up with the Civil Air Patrol, a group of young men interested inlearning how to fly. The military auxiliary group, which was founded duringWorld War II to help defend America’s coastlines against German and Japaneseattack, not only trained future pilots, it inculcated the patriotic Cold Warvalues of the time. Among its founders was David Harold Byrd, a right-wing Texasoilman and defense contractor. Byrd also owned the Texas School Book Depository,the Dallas warehouse where Oswald would be hired in the fall of 1963 andallegedly establish a sniper’s lair on the sixth floor of the building. It wasjust one of the many curiosities that marked the life of Lee Harvey Oswald.In New Orleans, young Oswald’s life began to intersect with older men who sawhow he could be of use, including characters who would later have flamboyantwalk-on roles in District Attorney Jim Garrison’s valiant but doomedinvestigation of the Kennedy assassination. David Ferrie—the Eastern Airlinespilot who supervised the local Civil Air Patrol chapter—was a particularlyeccentric personality. Suffering from alopecia, Ferrie took to wearing anill-fitting, reddish wig and filling in his missing eyebrows with theatricalslashes of greasepaint. Catholic-educated and homosexual, he led a secretive andtortured life. He liked to practice hypnosis techniques on the young cadetsunder his command and tried to lure them into a drug research program at TulaneUniversity with which he was connected. A passionate anti-Communist, Ferriethrew himself into New Orleans’s steamy anti-Castro politics. After the Bay ofPigs debacle, he denounced Kennedy with such vicious abandon during a speech toa veterans group that he was asked to step down from the podium. The president“ought to be shot,” Ferrie began telling people.In October 1956, Oswald—barely seventeen and less than a month into his tenthgrade year—followed the same path as his older brothers, throwing offMarguerite’s “yoke of oppression,” as they put it, and joining the Marines. Thefollowing year, he was sent to Atsugi, a naval air base outside of Tokyo, whichserved as a takeoff point for the CIA’s top secret U-2 spy flights over theSoviet Union. The Atsugi base was also one of the centers for the CIA’s LSDexperimentation. A CIA memo titled “‘Truth Drugs’ in Interrogation” revealed theagency practice of dosing agents who were marked for dangerous overseasmissions. An operative who had tripped on acid before, the memo noted, would beless likely to crack up if subjected to hallucinogenic treatments by hiscaptors. Some chroniclers of Oswald’s life have suggested that he was one of theyoung marines on whom the CIA performed its acid tests.Oswald’s overseas tour of duty was a troubled one. He shot himself in the armwith a derringer, apparently by accident. He was court-martialed twice, once forthe illegal possession of a firearm, the second time for pouring a drink over asergeant in a bar brawl. He suffered a nervous breakdown. But he also continuedto be defined by his intelligence and inquisitiveness. He began expressing aninterest in traveling to Russia, to see for himself what it was like. In short,he was the sort of boy-man—unfinished, angry, defiant, and hungry to experiencelife—who stands out from the ranks and gets attention.At some point, Oswald’s growing curiosity about the Soviet Union—the forbiddingland beyond the Iron Curtain that an entire generation of Americans had beentaught to fear and hate—began to receive support and guidance. Transferred to ElToro Air Station in Southern California in December 1958, he applied himself tolearning Russian, a challenging language difficult to master on one’s own. J.Lee Rankin, the chief counsel for the Warren Commission, would later suggestthat Oswald had received training at the Army Language School in Monterey,California, which was known for giving military and intelligence personnel crashcourses in a wide range of languages and dialects.Oswald was now launched on a grand adventure not entirely of his own making. Hequit the Marines, claiming—falsely—that his mother was injured and required hishelp. On September 20, 1959, nine days after receiving his discharge, he set offfor Russia, sailing first to England—where he disembarked at Southampton onOctober 9—and flying to Helsinki shortly thereafter. Oswald later told his wife,Marina, that he had taken a “hop”—a U.S. military transport flight—to get toFinland, which was the easiest point of entry to the Soviet Union.There was a magical element to Oswald’s journey. Despite the fact that he was abroke ex-serviceman who had only $203 in his bank account when he left America,Oswald enjoyed the best accommodations. In Helsinki, he stayed in two of thecity’s finest hotels, the Torni and the Klaus Kurki. After checking out, hestill had enough money to buy a ticket on the overnight train to Moscow.If Oswald was being moved by an unseen hand, his performance at the U.S. embassyin Moscow—where he arrived on a Saturday morning in October to theatricallyannounce his defection—seemed a particularly awkward piece of staging. There wasa scripted quality to the way he renounced his citizenship and declared hisintention to turn over military secrets to the Soviets. Listening to theslightly built young man, American consul Richard Snyder had the distinctfeeling that “this was part of a scene he had rehearsed before coming into theembassy. It was a preplanned speech.”But Oswald never seemed certain of the role he was playing during his two and ahalf years in the Soviet Union. He clearly was not a genuine defector, since theCIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies reacted to his provocative performanceat the U.S. embassy with a studied nonchalance, even though he threatened tohand over classified information from his tour of duty at the top secret U-2base. It took a full year before Angleton’s counterintelligence departmentfinally bothered opening up a standard 201 file on the defector. Oswald did notseem particularly threatening to the Soviets either. While KGB officers foundhim puzzling, they did not regard him as a master CIA spy. He did not snooparound secure areas. And despite his military service, the Russians learned thathe was a bad shot. When Oswald went on expeditions with his factory hunting clubin Minsk, he never could hit anything. A co-worker took pity on him once andshot a rabbit for him.A KGB official described Oswald in one document as “an empty person.” He was thetype who could be used as a “dangle” by a sophisticated puppet master likeAngleton, someone to flush out moles, to find out what the Soviets knew aboutthe U-2 program. In the Kabuki theater of Angleton’s mind, people played partswhose significance only he understood. It was the paper record—the “legend”—thatmattered most to Angleton. Under the covert wizard’s direction, a person’s filesometimes took on a life of its own, full of actions and dialogue that bore norelation to the subject’s real life. To Jim Angleton, the young, pliableAmerican playing the role of defector was a performer who had not yet reachedhis full potential. He was someone to watch over time.If there was a real Oswald, the picture emerged in flickering light, only to beseen by the very few people he allowed to get close to him. Nobody was in abetter position to observe Lee as he went about his new life in Minsk—whereSoviet authorities had given him a sparsely furnished but comfortable apartmentand a job in a radio factory—than Ernst Titovets, the medical student who wouldbecome Oswald’s best friend in Russia. The two young men spent much of theirfree time together, pursuing women, playing records in their apartments, goingto the opera, and debating the positive and negative aspects of life undercapitalism and Communism. Titovets would become Oswald’s Boswell, chroniclingthe young American’s quotidian life in a revealing memoir that would bepublished in Russia a half century later, but remain largely unknown in theUnited States.Titovets was better educated and more culturally sophisticated than his Americanfriend. The Russian had to explain to Oswald who George Gershwin was. But inspite of the high school dropout’s education gaps, Titovets recognized thatOswald was an innately smart young man. “I had ample opportunity to observeduring our debates how quick he was to grasp the essence of an abstractphilosophical idea,” Titovets later wrote in his memoir. “I carried away animpression of him as a very intelligent, quick-witted person.”Oswald, whose childhood hardships had made him sensitive to the exploitation ofthe poor and weak, was drawn to Marxism’s egalitarian promise and seemedgenuinely intrigued by the Soviet system. But, American to the core, he soonbegan to chafe under the regimentation of life in Minsk, making fun of theomnipresent Lenin posters that loomed over his radio factory and grumbling aboutthe compulsory exercise sessions and propaganda meetings in which workers had toparticipate. He once staged a one-man strike to protest what he said were thefactory’s outdated work practices. Work life in the United States was noparadise, Oswald acknowledged to Titovets, and racism was a national disgrace.But all in all, American workers enjoyed a higher standard of living and morefreedom, he said. “You live like slaves!” Oswald once yelled during aparticularly heated discussion with his Russian friend.On the whole, Oswald did not strike Titovets as being the political extremistthat he was widely portrayed to be after the Kennedy assassination. “Oswald didnot produce the impression of a narrow-minded political zealot . . . nor wouldhe push his ideas on others. A good listener, he was ready to learn new thingsand kept his mind open to new ideas.” Titovets saw his American companion as awork in progress, someone trying to bridge the chasm between East and West, anddevelop his own political philosophy. As he prepared to return to America,Oswald began drafting his vision of the ideal society, one that combined thebest features of capitalism and socialism, which he called the “Atheniansystem.” One biographer would later describe Oswald as a “pioneer . . . a lonelyAmerican anti-hero a few years ahead of his time,” working out his socialtheories thousands of miles away from home—ideas that mirrored the grassroots,participatory democracy that would soon be advocated by the New Left.Nothing about the Oswald that Titovets knew conformed to the profile of theangry loner in the Warren Report. He was popular with women and he had an easyway with children. When tense confrontations arose with other men—like the timehe got into an argument with a fellow worker named Max over a shopmachine—Oswald seemed to go limp. Even after Max grabbed a fistful of his shirtand shoved him against a steel pillar, Oswald simply stood quietly contemplatinghis antagonist until the man’s rage spent itself. “Judging by what I learnedabout Oswald,” concluded Titovets, who studied psychiatry in medical school, “itwould have been a psychological impossibility for him to kill a man.”While living in Minsk, Oswald displayed a sharp awareness of Soviet surveillancethat seemed to indicate some prior training. Oswald kept his apartment inspartan condition, as if carefully refraining from giving his living quartersany identifying characteristics. He would painstakingly examine his room for KGBbugs, and play his record player loud during some conversations to frustrate anyeavesdroppers. Visiting his apartment always gave Titovets a vaguely uneasyfeeling. “I wondered what particular feature about the room generated thatuncanny feeling of loneliness mixed with an unreasonable, animal-like feeling ofbeing constantly watched. Nice to discover a sort of creeping paranoia comingover you!”As when he was a boy, Oswald continued to be interested in the make-believeworld of spies. Perusing Titovets’s collection of English-language books oneday, he chose to borrow The Quiet American, Graham Greene’s mordant tale of aU.S. agent in French colonial Vietnam who wreaks havoc through his shinyidealism. Nonetheless, Titovets doubted that Oswald was an American spy. Heseemed to show no interest in intelligence gathering during his years in Russia.And there was no evidence that he was turned by the KGB. “Oswald maintained hisallegiance to his native country throughout his Russian period,” Titovets laterwrote. “His loyalty was evident in small gestures he made rather than in flashybombastic pronouncements. He was proud of his service with the U.S. Marines.Whenever we compared Russia with the United States, he invariably defended theAmerican side. . . . He would defend the American Army, American English,American girls, American food and American ways—you name it.”But if Oswald was not acting as a paid operative, he was being acted upon. Byearly 1961, when Oswald notified the U.S. embassy in Moscow that he wanted toreturn to America, he was the subject of an enormous amount of secret paperworkin the deep recesses of the CIA, FBI, State Department, and Office of NavalIntelligence.Years later, Richard Schweiker—the Republican senator from Pennsylvania who wasone of the first legislators to try to unravel the mystery of Lee Harvey Oswald,while serving with the Church Committee—eloquently summed up the strangemalleability of Oswald’s life. “Everywhere you look with him,” said Schweiker,“there are the fingerprints of intelligence.”Oswald’s reentry into the United States was absurdly easy, considering histreasonous track record. He had tried to renounce his citizenship; he haddeclared his intention to betray his country by handing over some of its mostzealously guarded military secrets; he had lived as if he were a Soviet citizenfor well over two years. And to top it off, he was bringing back with him aRussian wife, Marina, who had been raised by an uncle who was a KGB officer.Titovets had taken an immediate disliking to Marina, whom he regarded as achain-smoking, foulmouthed woman with none of Oswald’s intellectual complexity.But Oswald immediately fell under the spell of the sad-eyed beauty with sensuouslips. “The girl emanated raw sexuality about her, repellent to me, but perhapsprecisely the feature that attracted Lee,” observed Titovets. Lee and Marinawere introduced at a dance at the Trade Union House, one of Minsk’s popularentertainment centers. “The low cut of her dress stressed the size of herbreasts,” Titovets recalled. He immediately suspected she was KGB bait forOswald. When he later asked around about Marina, Titovets was told that she hadbeen run out of Leningrad by local authorities. “Taking into account her pasthistory and her legal problems,” he concluded, “she certainly had given the KGBa sure hold over her.” A month after he met Marina, Oswald proposed to her.It was one more curious episode in Oswald’s life. And yet none of his suspiciouspast, or that of his bride, caused U.S. authorities to block his return, placehim under detention, or subject him to rigorous interrogation. At the height ofthe Cold War—when paranoia about spies, subversives, and “brainwashed” GIs ranrampant throughout America—Oswald and his Soviet wife were allowed to passsmoothly into the country. The State Department even provided a $435 loan tohelp pay for the couple’s travel expenses. When the SS Maasdam, the cruise linerfrom Rotterdam carrying the Oswalds and their infant daughter, docked at aHoboken pier on the rainy afternoon of June 13, 1962, there were no federalagents awaiting the defector.The Oswalds were greeted only by a Travelers Aid Society caseworker named SpasRaikin. Despite persistent rumors, Raikin has always vehemently denied that hewas working for the CIA. But Raikin—a Bulgarian refugee who was active inanti-Communist politics—was politically sophisticated enough to realize thatthere was something strange about Oswald’s uneventful return to the UnitedStates. It was one more instance, in Oswald’s endlessly mystifying life, whenthe dog did not bark. “I wondered why there weren’t any government officials tomeet him,” Raikin recalled late in his life. “In my mind, there was the idea hecould be a spy. . . . I had suspicion, but I did not want to get furtherinvolved into this thing.”The day after arriving in the United States, the Oswalds flew to Fort Worth,where they moved in temporarily with Lee’s brother, Robert. It would take nearlytwo weeks before the FBI got around to interviewing Lee.Oswald was now entering the final act of his abbreviated life. Over the nextyear and a half, the young man seemed to lead an aimless existence, drifting toNew Orleans, returning to Texas, taking a side trip to Mexico City, as he jumpedfrom one job to the next, before finally ending up in the Texas School BookDepository. But on closer examination, there was a method to his movements.While in Texas, Oswald and his family came under the watchful care of people whoin turn were being closely watched. He met quietly with a prominent CIA officerin Dallas. He staged public scenes in New Orleans and Mexico City that calledattention to himself as a hotheaded militant, as he had done at the embassy inMoscow. There were invisible wires attached to Oswald—and some of the moreintriguing ones led to Allen Dulles.Lee Harvey Oswald was given to grand daydreams. He had big ideas about how tochange the world; he wanted to be part of a larger mission than his pettycircumstances allowed. But there were others who had their own plans for him.“[Lee] did not know who he was really serving,” Marina said years later. “He wasmanipulated and he got caught. He tried to play with the big boys.”George de Mohrenschildt dropped into the Oswalds’ threadbare lives in Fort Worthlike a beneficent fairy-tale prince. Tall, well groomed, cosmopolitan, with anetwork of high-placed friends that stretched from Dallas oil society to theEuropean aristocracy, “Baron” de Mohrenschildt—as he enjoyed being called—waseverything Oswald was not. He showed up one afternoon on the doorstep of theOswalds’ humble home—which he later described as “a shack near Sears Roebuck, asfar as I remember . . . very poorly furnished, decrepit, on a dusty road.” Hewas there, he said, on a mission of mercy—a White Russian émigré of noble birthwho had done well for himself in America, lending a hand to an impoverishedyoung couple recently arrived from his native land. De Mohrenschildt, a decadentold-world roué when it came to women, did not think much of Marina when he mether that day, finding her “not particularly pretty” and “a lost soul.” But heimmediately took a liking to Oswald, whom he found “charming.”Over the following months, de Mohrenschildt and his equally sophisticated wife,Jeanne—a fellow high-born Russian whose father had run the Far Eastern Railroadin China—hovered over the Oswalds, finding Lee jobs, installing the family innew living quarters, making sure that Marina’s rotting teeth were fixed andtheir baby got her inoculations, taking the young couple to parties, andintervening in their quarrels when they became violent. Later, when peopleremarked on how unlikely the friendship between the sophisticated baron and thehigh school dropout was, de Mohrenschildt simply shrugged it off. “I believe itis a privilege of an older age not to give a damn what others think of you. Ichoose my friends just because they appeal to me. And Lee did.”De Mohrenschildt explained that he admired his young friend’s rejection of thesegregationist values of his native South, as well as Oswald’s completedisinterest in the rampant materialism of American life—unlike Marina, whom thebaron found crude and moneygrubbing. “I am not a turkey which lives only tobecome fat,” Oswald announced with a smile one day, lifting his shirt to show deMohrenschildt his minimal belly. “Lee, your way of life is so un-American, itscares me to think what may become of you,” the older man responded.There was another reason he was drawn to Oswald, de Mohrenschildt later said.The scrawny young man with the big ideas about life reminded him of his onlyson, Sergei, who had died of cystic fibrosis a year earlier. Sweeping intoOswald’s life when he was still grieving the loss of Sergei, de Mohrenschildtcame to think of Lee as “almost a son.”But there were less sentimental reasons why the baron befriended the waywardyoung American. De Mohrenschildt was minding the Oswalds for the CIA.George de Mohrenschildt came from that lost world of Russian cavalry officersand palace balls that had been vaporized by war and revolution. His father,Sergius, had been a czarist official and a director of Nobel Oil, the petroleumgiant that struck fortune in the abundant Baku fields. When the Bolsheviks tookpower, Sergius was arrested and sentenced to a Siberian work camp, but thefamily fled to Poland. The de Mohrenschildts lost most of their old lives inexodus—including their land and their position, as well as George’s mother, whosuccumbed to typhoid fever. The surviving members of the family—especiallySergius and George’s older brother, Dimitri—developed a burning anti-Communistrage. His father “hated communism,” George later said. “That was his life’shatred.”During World War II, as Poland became a “blood land” in the fighting betweenHitler’s Wehrmacht and Stalin’s Red Army, Sergius fled west again, to NaziGermany, where he was welcomed as a comrade in the war to the finish withAsiatic Bolshevism. Sergius was not a devoted Nazi, but he soon acclimatedhimself to his new fatherland, doing work for the Abwehr, the German militaryintelligence agency. “George,” he told his son, “the Nazis are no good, andGermany is going to lose the war, but I prefer to be in Germany than in SovietRussia. At least I am free and nobody is bothering me.” But history finallycaught up with Sergius—he was killed near the end of the war during an Alliedbombing raid.Meanwhile, Dimitri von Mohrenschildt (George’s brother preferred the Germanversion of the family name) emigrated to America, where he would prosper—one ofthe cultured White Russians who managed to work their way into East Coast highsociety. Dimitri married Winifred “Betty” Hooker, a divorced Park Avenuesocialite, and became a prominent scholar, winning appointment in 1950 as thefirst chairman of Dartmouth’s Russian Civilization Department and launching theRussian Review, an anti-Communist journal. Dimitri moved in those circles wheremillionaires, academics, and spies commingled. He and his wife counted theBouviers—the parents of future First Lady Jackie Kennedy—as well as the dynasticBush family among their friends. Dimitri’s coeditor at the Russian Review—theconservative author William Henry Chamberlin—was a friend of Allen Dulles’s,with whom he worked on the Radio Liberty Committee, one of the Cold Warpropaganda projects launched by Dulles and his associates in the postwar period.Dimitri himself became a CIA asset in April 1950, when, according to an agencymemo, he was approved as a contact for foreign intelligence purposes.Dimitri had brought his younger brother to America in 1938. George—who stayedfor a time with Dimitri and his wife in their Park Avenue apartment and LongIsland estate—envied their good life, but seemed uncertain how to achieve it forhimself. George lacked his brother’s strong political convictions—veeringbetween Nazi and Communist sympathies early in his life, and later between anaristocratic paternalism and a sentimental New Leftism. George was also missingDimitri’s professional discipline and sense of direction. After arriving inAmerica, George tried his hand at selling sports clothes with his girlfriend atthe time, and when that venture flopped, he briefly became a perfume salesman.Later, he gave the insurance business a shot but failed to sell a single policy.Finally, George de Mohrenschildt settled on the oil business, figuring that hewould follow in his father’s footsteps. He eventually wound up in Texas, wherehe got a petroleum geology degree from the University of Texas, after cheatinghis way through the final exams. In typical de Mohrenschildt style, he charmedhis way out of trouble when he got caught, explaining with an aristocratic winkthat everyone in life cheats.De Mohrenschildt—who sported the year-round tan of a yachtsman orskier—continued to rely on his good looks and old-world charm as he pursued hiscareer in the oil business. He had a gift for bedding and wedding wealthywomen—including an eighteen-year-old Palm Beach debutante—and then tapping theirfamilies for funds to launch his various oil ventures. The second of his fourwives, Phyllis, was “a little bit wild—but very attractive and adventurous,” thebaron told the Warren Commission. She was in the habit of walking around therugged oil field in the Colorado Rockies where de Mohrenschildt was working atthe time, wearing only a bikini—a new fashion item in those days that theroughnecks working their drills undoubtedly found intriguing.Albert Jenner Jr., the Warren Commission co-counsel in charge of questioning deMohrenschildt, displayed a keen interest in his active love life. The baronconceded that he was something of a ladies’ man. “I am not a queer, you know,”he testified. “Although some people accuse me of that even.” While he knew howto seduce women, de Mohrenschildt could also be cruel to them. Dorothy, histeenaged bride, later said that he manhandled her, once kicking her in thestomach and striking her on the head with a hammer. He also enjoyed “kissing andpawing other women” right in front of her. The baron’s sexual habits were“abnormal,” declared Dorothy as she fled the marriage.None of de Mohrenschildt’s oil ventures paid off particularly well, and he wouldsoon drift away to try one more roll of the dice with the help of another richrelative or friend. His true skill was cultivating the wealthy and wellconnected. One of his first jobs in the oil business was working for PantepecOil—the petroleum company founded by the father of William F. Buckley Jr., theCIA-connected conservative publisher and pundit.Later, de Mohrenschildt proved adept at working his connections at the DallasPetroleum Club, a hotbed of anti-Kennedy ferment, whose leadingmembers—including oilmen Clint Murchison Sr., H. L. Hunt, and SidRichardson—were tied to Dulles, Lyndon Johnson, and J. Edgar Hoover. ThePetroleum Club also counted D. H. Byrd, the Texas School Book Depository owner,and Mayor Earle Cabell, brother of Dulles’s former CIA deputy, among itsregulars. De Mohrenschildt put Byrd’s wife on the board of the charity that hehad set up to fund cystic fibrosis research. It all came together at thePetroleum Club—the deals, the good works, and the darker stuff—over drinks inthe club’s wood-paneled rooms, located downtown in the elegant Baker Hotel.The international oil business and the U.S. intelligence establishment wereoverlapping worlds, and de Mohrenschildt soon found himself with a foot in eachone. He alluded cryptically to this early in his Warren Commission testimony,when he mentioned that he was involved in “a controversial business . . .international business.” But commission attorney Jenner quickly steered theconversation away from these dangerous shoals. “Also, I gather that you are apretty lively character,” Jenner interjected inanely.De Mohrenschildt was indeed a colorful character, as Jenner observed more thanonce during the hearing. But this was a less relevant aspect of the baron’s lifethan his involvement with American espionage. In the late 1950s, deMohrenschildt stopped drilling dry wells in Texas and Colorado and startedspending more time overseas, as a consultant on petroleum projects in LatinAmerica, Europe, and Africa. His work sometimes took him to Cold War hot spotssuch as Yugoslavia (which ejected him as a suspected spy) and Cuba. When hereturned from his trips abroad, de Mohrenschildt was routinely debriefed by theCIA’s Dallas field agent, J. Walton Moore.The baron always insisted that he was not a CIA agent, though his denials couldsometimes be convoluted. “I cannot say that I never was a CIA agent, I cannotprove it,” he wrote near the end of his life, in an unpublished memoir. “Icannot prove either that I ever was. Nobody can.” While it was probably truethat de Mohrenschildt was not an official agent, he was most certainly an agencyasset, gathering confidential information on his foreign business trips underwhat the CIA called “commercial cover.”De Mohrenschildt was not motivated by ideology or patriotism. He was not likehis brother, whom he described almost bemusedly as “really a ferociousanti-communist.” The baron did “not believe in anything, either religious orpolitical,” said his Dallas neighbor, a fellow White Russian named IgorVoshinin. De Mohrenschildt believed only in himself. He had learned from hisrootless, stateless existence to ingratiate himself with whomever had power ormoney. He was at your service, if he could also serve himself. He wasn’t much ofan oilman, but having friends in the spy world opened doors for him when doingbusiness overseas.So it was not surprising when de Mohrenschildt showed up at the Oswalds’ frontdoor that summer afternoon in the company of a man named Colonel Lawrence Orlov,a CIA informant who was a friend and frequent handball partner of J. WaltonMoore, the agency’s man in Dallas. De Mohrenschildt himself had also becomefriendly with Moore, when the CIA “domestic contacts” agent began debriefing himafter his overseas trips. The baron thought of his CIA handler as a “very nicefellow . . . and we got along well.” Moore, the son of missionary parents, hadbeen born and raised in China, like de Mohrenschildt’s wife, Jeanne. “So Iinvited him and his wife to the house and he got along fabulously well withJeanne,” the baron later recalled. “I used to see Mr. Moore occasionally forlunch. A cosmopolitan character, most attractive.”After the Oswalds arrived in Texas from Russia, it was Moore’s turn to invite deMohrenschildt to lunch. The CIA man had a request for his Russian-born friend.De Mohrenschildt was apparently tasked with keeping an eye on the young couple—ajob he assiduously performed until the following spring, when he and his wifeleft on business for Haiti.Lee was in thrall to de Mohrenschildt, the big, suave man of the world—thefather figure he never had. They swapped political jokes from either side of theIron Curtain. The baron grilled him about his life in Minsk, as if he wereconducting an agency debriefing. But Lee didn’t seem to mind—he glowed under theolder man’s attention. “Oswald would do anything that de Mohrenschildt told himto do,” observed the baron’s son-in-law, Gary Taylor, who lived in Dallas withde Mohrenschildt’s daughter, Alexandra.Marina Oswald later agreed that de Mohrenschildt and her husband had been“fairly good friends” and that the baron was “a good humanitarian who wasinterested in other people.” But in an interview with FBI agents after theassassination, Marina added a provocative remark about the two men’srelationship. Oswald “was somewhat afraid of de Mohrenschildt, who was big instature and talked loudly,” she reported. Her husband clearly knew who, betweenthe two of them, had the power.In the end, no Warren Commission witness betrayed Oswald more deeply than Georgede Mohrenschildt. His testimony before the commission—the lengthiest of thehearings—did more to convict Oswald in the eyes of the press and the public thananyone else. He tied Oswald to the alleged murder weapon, telling the commissionabout the day when an agitated Marina showed him and his wife the rifle that Leehad stashed in a closet. And most important, de Mohrenschildt gave the WarrenCommission the motive for killing Kennedy that the panel had sorely lacked.Oswald, the baron speculated with devastating effect, “was insanely jealous ofan extraordinarily successful man, who was young, attractive, had a beautifulwife, had all the money in the world, and was a world figure. And poor Oswaldwas just the opposite. He had nothing. He had a bitchy wife, had no money, was amiserable failure in everything he did.” Shooting Kennedy, he concluded in oneof the more memorable phrases produced by the official investigation, madeOswald “a hero in his own mind.”De Mohrenschildt had enough of a conscience to feel uneasy about his Judas-likeperformance before the commission, and—as if to make amends—he offeredcontradictory testimony about Oswald. “But what I wanted to underline, that wasalways amazing to me, that as far as I am concerned [Oswald] was an admirer ofPresident Kennedy,” he told the panel. During a conversation they had about JFK,acknowledged de Mohrenschildt, Oswald described him as “an excellent president,young, full of energy, full of good ideas.” Oswald’s own words about Kennedycompletely erased the motive that de Mohrenschildt proposed to the panel. Butthe Warren Commission simply glided over the glaring inconsistencies in deMohrenschildt’s testimony. It was the baron’s unfounded and irresponsibleremarks about the “crazy lunatic” Oswald—a man supposedly driven to kill by theresentments born of his pathetic life—that stuck with the commission. DeMohrenschildt took the young man with whom he had spent hours discussingpolitics and offering advice about love and marriage—the man who hung on hisevery word, whom he thought of as a son—and threw him under the wheels ofinfamy.On the morning of April 22, 1964, when he appeared at the VeteransAdministration building in Washington—where the Warren Commission had set upshop—George de Mohrenschildt was not in possession of his customary smooth,self-composed demeanor. The months after the assassination had been extremelydifficult ones for the baron and his wife. He had been summoned to the U.S.embassy in Port-au-Prince and treated like he was a suspect in the case. Hisbusiness affairs in Haiti began to suffer as rumors spread about the mysteriousRussian who had been Oswald’s closest confidant. It is highly unlikely that deMohrenschildt knew in advance about how Oswald was to be used on November 22,1963. This sort of messy business was not part of the baron’s portfolio. But hewas sharp enough to quickly begin connecting the dots.De Mohrenschildt was not certain how he would come out of the Warren Commissionhearings. Would his career be ruined? Would he be put on trial? Or did he faceeven more dire consequences? America was not Soviet Russia, but the baron hadlearned from his worldwide wanderings that power was capable of anything, nomatter where it operated.De Mohrenschildt was quite anxious when he entered the hearing room thatmorning. His eyes fixed immediately on Allen Dulles. The spymaster “did notinterfere in the proceedings” that day, observed de Mohrenschildt, lettingJenner handle the interrogation. But the baron found Dulles’s silent presence tobe unnerving. “[He] was there as a distant threat,” de Mohrenschildt later wrotein his memoir—a provocative remark that he did not explain further. Was the merepresence of Dulles, looming over the proceedings, a reminder that deMohrenschildt must carefully mind his words?The baron found his entire experience as a star witness for the WarrenCommission—which dragged on for two days—to be a grueling exercise in“intimidation.” As he prepared to begin his testimony, de Mohrenschildt laterclaimed, Jenner put him on stern notice. “We know more about your life than youyourself, so answer all my questions truthful[ly] and sincerely,” Jenner warnedhim. Over the next two days, Jenner switched between chilly aggressiveness andingratiating flattery as he worked over de Mohrenschildt. Afterward, Jeanne deMohrenschildt followed her husband to the witness table, bringing along theirtwo Manchester terriers, Nero and Poppaea, for emotional support. When the deMohrenschildts’ interrogation was all over, the baron told his wife, “It was anunpleasant experience, but in Russia we would have been sent to Siberia forlife.”Jenner raked over the most embarrassing details of de Mohrenschildt’s privatelife, but he stayed resolutely clear of his espionage connections. The baronrealized just how thoroughly the commission had penetrated his personal lifewhen Dulles got his hands on private correspondence that de Mohrenschildt hadexchanged with the First Lady’s mother, Janet, following the Kennedyassassination. After divorcing Jackie’s rakish father, “Black Jack” Bouvier,Janet had married Washington stockbroker Hugh Auchincloss, whose family fortunederived from his grandfather’s Standard Oil partnership with John D.Rockefeller. De Mohrenschildt was forced by the Warren Commission to read outloud from his own letters to Janet Auchincloss, whom he had known from the timethat her daughter Jackie was a girl, romping on the sands of Long Island’s GoldCoast. Jenner put the baron on the spot, asking him to explain why he hadquestioned Oswald’s guilt in one letter he sent Jackie Kennedy’s mother.“Somehow,” he wrote Mrs. Auchincloss three weeks after the assassination, “Istill have a lingering doubt, notwithstanding all the evidence, of Oswald’sguilt.” Since his letter obviously undermined his own testimony about Oswald asthe “crazy lunatic” who killed the president, de Mohrenschildt was put in theawkward position of trying to clarify his contradictory remarks.After the de Mohrenschildts concluded their Warren Commission “ordeal,” theywere invited by Janet Auchincloss and her husband to their home on O Street inGeorgetown. Relaxing with his old friend in the comfortable splendor of herhome, the baron and his wife felt confident enough to voice their true feelingsabout the assassination. By now, it was dawning on the couple that the WarrenCommission was not interested in the real story of the president’s murder. Theysuspected that the true purpose of the investigation was “to waste thetaxpayers’ money and to distract [the] attention of the American people from the[real culprits] involved in the assassination.”Jeanne de Mohrenschildt risked upsetting the civility of the gathering bydirectly challenging Mrs. Auchincloss. “Why don’t you—the relatives of ourbeloved president, you who are so wealthy—why don’t you conduct a realinvestigation as to who was the rat who killed him?”Mrs. Auchincloss regarded Jeanne coldly. “But the rat was your friend Lee HarveyOswald.” She was in no mood to be lectured by friends of Oswald. Upstairs in herattic, Mrs. Auchincloss was still keeping the blood-spattered pink Chanel suitthat her daughter had worn in Dallas.Jackie Kennedy’s mother had no doubt arrived at her conviction about Oswald’sguilt with the help of her neighbor and family friend, Allen Dulles. Herhusband, Hugh—who had served in Navy intelligence before pursuing his investmentbanking career—and Dulles were from the same world. The Auchinclosses, in fact,had more in common politically with Dulles than they did with the latepresident. When de Mohrenschildt had bumped into JFK’s mother-in-law on a planetrip during the 1960 campaign, he was surprised to hear Mrs. Auchincloss tellhim that she was a staunch Nixon supporter and that Jack did not stand a chance.It was a remarkable scene at the Auchincloss mansion that spring evening in1964. Fresh from their cowardly performance before the Warren Commission, the deMohrenschildts were now urging JFK’s in-laws, who had never supported himpolitically, to show some moral courage and use their wealth to solve the crime.Despite how his wife had been rebuffed, de Mohrenschildt continued to argue thepoint with Mrs. Auchincloss. “Janet, you were Jack Kennedy’s mother-in-law, andI am a complete stranger. But I would spend my own money and lots of time tofind out who were the real assassins or the conspirators. Don’t you want anyfurther investigation? You have infinite resources.”But Mrs. Auchincloss was unmoved. “Jack is dead and nothing will bring himback.” Finally, as the discussion reached an emotional crescendo, the twowomen—Janet and Jeanne—fell into each other’s arms and began weeping.As if the evening were not unsettling enough, at some point Dulles himselfshowed up. The spymaster circled in on de Mohrenschildt and began asking himpointed questions about Oswald, as if they were still in the hearing room. Didthe accused assassin have any reason to hate Kennedy? The “astute” Dulles, asthe baron described him, knew that this was the most mixed-up part of deMohrenschildt’s testimony and it was imperative to “fix” it, if the commissionwere to succeed in portraying Oswald as a lone nut. But de Mohrenschildt againfrustrated Dulles, giving him the answer Dulles did not want to hear. No, hesaid, Oswald did not hate Kennedy—in fact, he was “an admirer” of the president.At this point, Dulles would have certainly noted that—despite his accommodatingperformance before the Warren inquiry—George de Mohrenschildt might pose aproblem further down the line.Later that evening, as the de Mohrenschildts took their leave, Janet Auchinclosstook the baron aside. “Incidentally,” she said in a voice now tinged with frost,“my daughter Jacqueline never wants to see you again because you were close toher husband’s assassin.”“It’s her privilege,” was the baron’s courtly reply.It was the beginning of another kind of exile for the rootless cosmopolite, whowould find himself increasingly banished from the high society world that hedepended on for contacts and contracts. It all seemed grossly unfair to thebaron. His only sin had been to believe his CIA friend Moore when Moore told himthat Oswald was merely a “harmless” eccentric who needed some friendlysupervision. De Mohrenschildt prided himself on his worldliness. But in the end,he realized, he had been used—just like Oswald, who, after being taken intopolice custody, had shouted out frantically that he was “a patsy.” DeMohrenschildt, too, had been set up to play a role—to incriminate Oswald. And,like Oswald, he didn’t realize it until it was too late.In the last years of his life, de Mohrenschildt sought atonement for his sins,to make it right with the ghost of Lee Harvey Oswald. In his memoir, I Am aPatsy!—an outpouring from the heart whose raw, Russian-accented syntax deMohrenschildt did not bother to polish—he apologized for the “damage” he hadcaused “to the memory of Lee, my dear friend.” He proclaimed Oswald’s innocenceand took back the damning things he had told the Warren Commission. In truth,“Lee was not jealous of [the] Kennedys’ wealth,” he wrote, “and did not envytheir social positions, of that I was sure. To him wealth and society were bigjokes, but he did not resent them.”De Mohrenschildt had described Oswald to the Warren Commission as a“semi-educated hillbilly”—someone “you can’t take seriously . . . you just laughat.” But now, he wrote of his late friend’s “original mind” and his“nonconformist” thinking. Along with the Titovets chronicle, I Am a Patsy!stands out as the most convincing portrait we have of the true Oswald. DeMohrenschildt’s manuscript, which his wife gave to the House Select Committee onAssassinations after his death, remains unpublished but is available online.Oswald comes across in the baron’s memoir as a budding ’60s radical—a mansensitive enough to identify with the plight of black Americans and NativeAmericans in a white-dominated society, and hardheaded enough to recognize thefundamental flaws of American democracy. “Under dictatorship, people areenslaved but they know it,” he told de Mohrenschildt, recalling his days in theSoviet Union. “Here, the politicians constantly lie to people and they becomeimmune to these lies because they have the privilege of voting. But voting isrigged and democracy here is a gigantic profusion of lies and cleverbrainwashing.” Oswald worried about the FBI’s police-state surveillance tactics.And he believed that America was turning more “militaristic” as it increasinglyinterfered in the internal affairs of other countries. Someday, he predicted,there would be a coup d’état.As de Mohrenschildt contemplated America in the mid-1970s, when he wrote hismanuscript, he began to regard Oswald as a prophetic figure. By then, the UnitedStates was a country debased by war, assassination, government corruption, andconstitutional subversion. “My wife and I spent many an agonizing momentthinking of Lee, ashamed that we did not stand up more decisively in hisdefense,” he wrote. “But who would have listened to us at the time and wouldhave published anything true and favorable [about] him?”De Mohrenschildt’s life took on a frantic quality near the end, as he beganworking on his memoir and trying to make sense of his entangled relationshipwith Oswald. In September 1976, he mailed a distraught, handwritten letter tohis old family friend, George Bush, who was then serving as CIA director in theGerald Ford administration. De Mohrenschildt knew Bush from his prep school daysat Phillips Academy, when Bush was the roommate of Dimitri von Mohrenschildt’sstepson. Now the baron was appealing to the CIA director’s sense of family andclass loyalty to help him. De Mohrenschildt claimed that he and his wife werethe targets of some sort of harassment. “Our phone [is] bugged, and we are beingfollowed everywhere. . . . We are being driven to insanity by the situation.” DeMohrenschildt thought the surveillance campaign began after he suffered thedeath of a second child from cystic fibrosis—his daughter Nadya—a traumaticevent that had made him start “behaving like a damn fool” and delving into hispainful past. He began “to write, stupidly and unsuccessfully, about Lee H.Oswald,” de Mohrenschildt told Bush, “and [I] must have angered a lot of peopleI do not know. But to punish an elderly man like myself and my highly nervousand sick wife is really too much.”The baron ended with a forlorn plea, for old time’s sake. “Could you dosomething to remove the net around us? This will be my last request for help andI will not annoy you any more.”Bush sent back a sympathetic reply, assuring de Mohrenschildt that he was notthe target of federal authorities and blaming his troubles on renewed mediainterest in the Kennedy assassination and overly inquisitive journalists.By the following March, the sixty-five-year-old de Mohrenschildt was separatedfrom his wife, struggling with depression, and living with family friends in awooden bungalow tucked between the more luxurious mansions that stretched southof Palm Beach. His testimony was once again in demand—this time from the HouseSelect Committee on Assassinations, whose investigators were showing a keenerinterest in the truth than the Warren panel had. On the morning of March 29,1977, committee investigator Gaeton Fonzi rolled up outside the dark-shingledbeach house, and when told that de Mohrenschildt was not at home, thecongressional staffer left his card with the baron’s daughter, Alexandra. Earlythat evening, after returning to his Miami motel room, Fonzi got a call fromBill O’Reilly, who was working in those days as a Dallas TV reporter. O’Reillyhad some stunning news. George de Mohrenschildt had been found dead at home, hishead blown apart by the blast from a 20-gauge shotgun. Fonzi’s card was found inthe dead man’s pocket. (In his 2012 book, Killing Kennedy, O’Reilly exaggeratedhis personal involvement in the drama, placing himself on de Mohrenschildt’sdoorstep as the shotgun blast rang out. As subsequent news reports pointed out,O’Reilly was actually in Dallas at the time.)The Palm Beach County coroner ruled de Mohrenschildt’s death a suicide, but hisviolent demise incited heated public speculation for a time. His death came amida flurry of other sudden exits during that season of renewed congressionalinquiry into the Kennedy case. Witnesses succumbed to heart attacks andsuicides, or were dispatched in more dramatic ways—as in the case of Mafia-CIAgo-between Johnny Rosselli, who was garroted, chopped up, stuffed into an oildrum, and dumped in Biscayne Bay. Some investigators felt the rising mortalityrate of Kennedy witnesses was connected to the creeping dread in Washington thatjustice was finally to be done.Was de Mohrenschildt murdered before he could begin talking to the HouseAssassinations Committee? Or did he take his own life, in atonement for what hehad done with it? Either way, he was one more victim of the past.If a “legend” was being woven around Lee Harvey Oswald, there was nobody who didmore to move Oswald’s story along during his days in Dallas, besides George deMohrenschildt, than a young housewife named Ruth Paine. It was Ruth Paine whotook in Marina and her young children as the Oswalds’ marriage started comingapart. It was she who most closely observed the intimate details of Lee’s life.Oswald would plant clues for Ruth—like the draft of a puzzling letter to theSoviet embassy in Washington that he left on her typing desk—that made hersuspect he was some sort of spy. Did he do this sort of thing on purpose? shelater wondered. Was it part of the profile he was supposed to leave behind?Ruth was the curious type—you could say even a busybody, the sort of woman whofelt she could set the world straight, and it was her obligation to do so. Afterher husband, Michael, took an engineering job at Bell Helicopter in Fort Worth,Ruth found herself marooned in Texas—a lonely, liberal arts–educated Quaker fromup north who was stuck in a cowboy culture. Her isolation only grew when she andMichael began drifting apart and he moved out of the family house into his ownapartment in September 1962.So when a friend invited her to a party at his house the following February,Ruth eagerly agreed to come. Among the other guests who would be there, she wastold, was a young couple recently arrived from Russia. Ruth had taken up Russianseveral years before, and here was an opportunity to polish her skills withpeople more fluent than she.It was the de Mohrenschildts who brought the Oswalds to the party and whointroduced them to Ruth. Later, JFK conspiracy researchers made much of this,suggesting that it was not just an introduction but a “hand-off” as the deMohrenschildts prepared to leave Dallas for Haiti. But if Ruth Paine wasassuming de Mohrenschildt’s role as Oswald’s monitor, she was not doing so as awitting agent. Paine would later tell the Warren Commission that she had nevermet Baron de Mohrenschildt before and had not seen him since that fatefulevening.Ruth’s motives for getting tangled up in Lee and Marina’s messy lives hadnothing to do with Cold War stratagems—her reasons were far more human thanthat. While she found Lee somewhat tedious and full of himself, she wasimmediately taken by Marina. “In spite of my faulty Russian, I found Marina easyto talk to and very personable,” she later recalled. Ruth got Marina’s addressand wrote her soon after, asking if she could come visit her sometime. It wasthe beginning of a friendship that would change both women’s lives forever.Decades later, Paine collaborated with author Thomas Mallon on a bestsellingbook intended to prove that there was nothing conspiratorial about the events inDallas, only a kind of terrible serendipity. A generous young mother takes inthe family of the future assassin of President Kennedy, and her life is neverthe same. End of story. Except that it wasn’t—Ruth’s story was far moreinteresting than that.Paine is a woman of stubborn conviction, even in quiet retirement at a pleasantQuaker-run home in Northern California. She continues to dismiss all evidence ofa conspiracy in Dallas as “nonsense” and—in contrast to de Mohrenschildt’slate-life conversion—she still insists on Oswald’s guilt as the sole assassin.She still wears the same sensible, bobbed haircut that she sported as a Dallashousewife, though now it’s snowy white. And, despite her advanced age, she holdsherself erect, with the fierce determination of a woman who refuses to bend totime or to new information about her storied past.During a recent visit to her home, some fifty years after the assassination,there was only a fleeting moment when Ruth acknowledged that Oswald might havebeen a pawn in a historical drama much larger than himself. When her visitorsuggested that dreamy-eyed adventurers like Oswald can become easy prey forthose with cynical intentions, she quickly nodded. “My parents had a name forthat: ‘shut-eyed liberals,’” she said.It’s a term that applies equally to Ruth Paine. In April 1963, she was thirtyyears old, and—like Marina—the mother of two small children and estranged fromher husband, when she invited the Russian woman and her little girls to moveinto her modest, two-bedroom clapboard house in Irving, outside of Dallas. Painewas filled with the generosity of her faith when she took in Marina. She wouldgrow to love Marina, she said later, “as if she were a sister.” (To some, itseemed that Ruth was also romantically infatuated with her exotic houseguest,who exuded a kind of seductive distress.) But despite Ruth’s best intentions,she helped lay waste to the Oswalds’ lives. In the end, Marina would wish shehad never met her rescuer.Ruth Paine has always scoffed at the idea that she played an intelligence rolein the Oswald story. A visitor asked her point-blank if she had any contact withthe CIA. “Not that I’m aware of,” she laughed. This is true, as far as it goes.Ruth and her husband, Michael, were not the cloak-and-dagger type—they were toostarry-eyed and idealistic for that. But they were the sort of people who wouldcome to the attention of security agencies. In fact, Allen Dulles himself knewall about the unusual family backgrounds of the Paines.Ruth Paine’s parents, William and Carol Hyde—who met as Stanford Universitystudents in the 1920s—were dedicated foot soldiers in Norman Thomas’s SocialistParty crusade. Ruth remembered passing out Norman Thomas presidential campaignbuttons at the Socialist Party convention in Washington, D.C., in 1940, when shewas just eight years old. Her parents were also active members of thecooperative movement, and William went to work as an executive for NationwideInsurance, a company that originated as a co-op. The Hydes’ involvement in theSocialist Party and co-op movement brought them into bare-knuckled conflictswith the Communist Party, which was in the habit of trying to muscle in onleft-wing enterprises that had energy and promise.The CIA, which took a strong interest in the anti-Communist left, eventuallytook an interest in Ruth’s father. According to a CIA document, Hyde wasconsidered “for a covert use” in Vietnam in 1957, but for unexplained reasonsthe agency decided not to utilize him. Hyde did work for a year in Peru, settingup co-op credit unions for the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID),an organization whose work was often entwined with that of the CIA. Governmentdocuments suggest that Ruth’s sister, Sylvia, later went to work for the CIA,and Sylvia’s husband, John Hoke, was employed by AID.In short, the young Dallas housewife who took the Oswald family into her carewas not simply a Quaker do-gooder but a woman with a politically complex familyhistory. She grew up in that strongly anti-Communist wing of the American leftthat overlapped with the espionage world. Ruth Paine was not an operativeherself, but there was a constellation of dark stars hovering all around her,even if she chose not to pay attention.But it was the family background of Ruth’s husband, Michael, that most directlyoverlapped with Allen Dulles’s world. Mary Bancroft, Dulles’s mistress, was oneof the oldest friends of Michael Paine’s mother—also named Ruth. Michael’sparents, George Lyman Paine Jr. and Ruth Forbes Paine, were the kind of oddducks that Mary liked collecting—quirky offspring of prominent New Englandheritage with minds as restless as hers. Lyman was an architect and a gentlemanTrotskyite whose political activities earned him a place on the FBI’s watchlist. Ruth Forbes Paine hailed from a Boston blue-blood family that had made itsfortune from the China tea and opium trade, and counted Ralph Waldo Emersonamong its progenitors. She would give herself over to the pursuit of world peaceand the exploration of human consciousness. In the 1920s, Mary was a regular atthe salons presided over by Lyman and Ruth in their spacious studio apartment onthe Upper East Side—gatherings that drew a colorful menagerie, includingartists, trust-fund revolutionaries, truth seekers, and other devotees of theesoteric.Ruth Forbes Paine came from such established Yankee wealth that her family ownedits own island, Naushon Island, off Cape Cod. After she and Lyman divorced, Ruthwould take her sons, Michael and Cameron, to summer on the island. The Forbesfamily often extended invitations to their circle of friends to join them in thecottages on their private paradise. Among those invited to Naushon Island byRuth Forbes Paine were Mary Bancroft and Allen Dulles.As the Warren Commission went about its business, Mary wrote Dulles chattyletters about the Forbes and Paine families, and their horrified reaction to theevents in Dallas, as if she were back in wartime Switzerland and still filingespionage reports. Bancroft reminded Dulles that she had known Michael Paine’smother “extremely well” for over forty years and had spent summers with her onNaushon Island. She enumerated the families’ many lovable oddities and theirsense of grand entitlement. “I was always fascinated by those proper Bostonhomes—and by the Forbes family at Naushon where I spent a lot of time,” wroteMary in a March 1964 letter to Dulles. “In those homes, anyone could sayabsolutely anything—everything was accepted and examined. One met labor leaders,pacifists, Negroes—everything but Catholics! Lyman Paine, Ruth’s first husbandand Michael Paine’s father, came from a similar background—authentic, properBostonians, the kind of people who still believe today that the U.S. is theirinvention on lease to all the rest of us.”In another letter to Dulles, Mary summed up the privileged and politicallyeccentric world of the Paines by making a devastating comparison—one that hadcertainly already occurred to Dulles. “I would only like to point out that thisis the same kind of ‘background’ that one runs into with both Noel Field andAlger Hiss—this Quaker–early American family thing.” Dulles knew this typewell—he had a history of putting such people to good use. They were the blissfuldo-gooders who later wondered how they had stumbled into history’s grinder.It was another striking “coincidence” in the endlessly enigmatic Oswald story.The housewife who took the Oswalds under her wing had married into a familywhose foibles and weaknesses were well known to Dulles and his mistress. RuthPaine was aware of her mother-in-law’s connection to Bancroft and Dulles. Hermother-in-law, in fact, had told her that she invited the couple to enjoy aget-away on the family island. But with typical obstinacy, Ruth refused to seeany particular significance in this Dulles link to her family.Dulles himself acknowledged the flat-out weirdness of these curious facts and,in his own characteristic fashion, simply laughed it off. The conspiracy-mindedwould have a field day, he chuckled, if they knew that he had visited Dallasthree weeks before the assassination and that he had a personal connection tothe woman whom he identified as Marina Oswald’s “landlady.”But Ruth Paine was more than that. She was also the woman who—the month beforeJFK’s arrival in Dallas—informed Lee about the job opening in the Texas SchoolBook Depository, the warehouse building that loomed over the final stretch ofPresident Kennedy’s motorcade route. Ruth had been told about the warehouse jobby a neighbor. The building was owned by yet another intriguing character in theOswald drama, right-wing Texas millionaire, David Harold Byrd.D. H. Byrd received scant attention after the Kennedy assassination, despite hisbuilding’s role in the crime. The Warren Commission never questioned him, andreporters did not profile him—even after the millionaire took the odd step ofremoving the eight-pane window from which Oswald allegedly fired his shots atKennedy’s limousine and hanging it in his Dallas mansion. Byrd said he fearedthat souvenir hunters might steal Oswald’s so-called sniper’s perch from thebook warehouse, but he displayed the infamous window in his own home like atrophy.Byrd’s name was woven through the turbulent politics of the Kennedy era. He wasa crony of Lyndon Johnson and a cousin of Senator Harry Byrd of Virginia, awhite supremacist and a leader of the rising conservative movement. He alsobelonged to the Suite 8F Group, an association of right-wing Texas tycoons thattook its name from the Lamar Hotel room in Houston where they held theirmeetings. The group included George Brown and Herman Brown of Brown & Root—aconstruction giant built on government contracts—and other militaryindustrialists and oil moguls who had financed the rise of LBJ.The owner of the Texas Book Depository was closely associated with a number ofpassionate Kennedy adversaries, including Curtis LeMay, the Air Force chiefwhose relentless quest for a nuclear showdown with the Soviet Union caused thepresident to question the general’s sanity. LeMay bestowed a glowing Air Forcecommendation on Byrd in May 1963 for his role in founding the Civil Air Patrol,the military auxiliary group that counted a teenaged Oswald among its cadets.Did Byrd and his associates in the national security field use Ruth Paine tomaneuver Oswald into the Texas Book Depository by passing word of the jobopening to her through her neighbor? Always looking for ways to help thedistressed couple in her care, Ruth quickly tipped off Lee about the job. Theearnest Quaker might have played a pivotal role in unknowingly sealing his fate.But one way or the other, Oswald seemed doomed to end up in the building and tomeet his date with infamy. By October 1963, when he went to work in thebuilding, there were too many unseen forces at work on the young man—who turnedtwenty-four that month—for him to call his life his own.In the months leading up to the Kennedy assassination, Oswald was moved here andthere with the calculation of a master chess player. In April, he returned tohis hometown, New Orleans, with Marina and the girls, where he called attentionto himself by jumping into the combustible world of Cuban politics. He reachedout to the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, the leading pro-Castro group in theUnited States, which was the target of such heavy FBI and CIA pressure that itstwo founders later succumbed and offered their services as government informers.At the same time he was dallying with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, Oswaldalso made contact with the Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil (DRE)—a groupof young, militant, anti-Castro Cuban exiles overseen by the CIA’s point man onCuba, David Phillips. Playing both sides of the Cuba fence, Oswald began passingout Fair Play leaflets in the streets while working out of the same buildingwhere Guy Banister, a former FBI agent who was involved in anti-Communistoperations, maintained his office.Oswald’s double-dealing was bound to lead to a blowup, and in August it did,when he was angrily confronted by DRE activists while passing out his pro-Castroflyers. A New Orleans police lieutenant who later investigated the tusslereported that Oswald seemed to have staged the whole thing “to create anincident—but when the incident occurred, he remained absolutely peaceful andgentle.” The New Orleans fracas recalled Oswald’s theatrics in the U.S. embassyin Moscow, where he had announced his defection.In early September, Oswald popped up again in Dallas, where he and his familywould move back later that month. This Oswald sighting is an extremelysuggestive one, since he was spotted in the company of none other than DavidAtlee Phillips—one of the more glaring indications that the ex-marine was thefocus of an intelligence operation. Oswald and Phillips were observed talkingtogether in the lobby of a downtown Dallas office building by Antonio Veciana, aprominent Cuban exile leader whose violent group, Alpha 66, had come close tokilling Castro with a bazooka attack. Veciana—who arrived at the Dallas buildingfor his own meeting with Phillips, his CIA supervisor—would later recognize theslight, pale man he had seen with Phillips that afternoon, when Oswald’s facewas splashed across front pages and TV screens. Phillips had trained him well,Veciana later said. “He taught me how to remember faces, how to remembercharacteristics. I am sure it was Oswald.”Veciana told his story to House Assassinations Committee investigator GaetonFonzi in the late 1970s and later repeated it to journalists. But even when theaging exile leader climbed onstage at a Washington conference of JFKassassination researchers in September 2014 to retell his remarkable story, themainstream press still did nothing to spotlight it. “I was trained by the CIA,as was Oswald,” said Veciana, who was the accounting manager for a Havana bankbefore he joined the anti-Castro movement. “Oswald and Fidel Castro were idealscapegoats for the murder of the president. . . . It really was a coup d’etat.”In late September, Oswald took a bus trip to Mexico City and again made aspectacle of himself while trying in vain to obtain travel visas for Cuba at theCuban and Soviet embassies. While Oswald visited Mexico City, someoneimpersonating him made phone calls to the Cuban and Soviet embassies—calls thatwere intercepted on CIA surveillance tapes. The agency later claimed that thesetapes were routinely destroyed. But J. Edgar Hoover himself listened to themimmediately after the assassination and the FBI chief informed Lyndon Johnson,the new president, that the voice on the tapes was not Oswald’s. Both men knewthe stunning significance of this audio fakery by the CIA—it showed thatKennedy’s alleged killer was somehow entangled in espionage business. He was notsimply a deranged loner.In the final weeks of his life, Oswald was the subject of particularly intenseCIA coverage. Much of this scrutiny emanated from the offices of Jim Angletonand David Phillips. After sifting through declassified government documents fromthis period, John Newman—a University of Maryland history professor and formerU.S. military intelligence officer—concluded that the agency had demonstrated “akeen operational interest in Oswald.” Newman’s skilled decryption of theintelligent design behind Oswald’s activities—which he first outlined in his1995 book, Oswald and the CIA—was a historical breakthrough in understanding thealleged assassin’s mysterious life.Oswald was ostensibly being closely tracked by the CIA as well as by the FBIbecause he was a recent defector and a self-proclaimed revolutionary. But, asPresident Kennedy prepared to visit Dallas, something curious occurred withinthis surveillance labyrinth. On October 9, Oswald was suddenly removed from theFBI “FLASHLIST”—the bureau’s index of suspicious individuals to be kept underclose watch. FBI officials took this surprising step despite Oswald’s suspiciousbehavior in Mexico City. The day after the FBI took Oswald off its watch list,the CIA also downgraded him as a security risk. On October 10, four seniorcounterintelligence officials who reported to Angleton and Helms signed off on acurious cable to the CIA station chief in Mexico City, assuring him there was noreason to be concerned about Oswald because his stay in the Soviet Union had a“maturing effect” on him.These signals about Oswald circulating in the intelligence community had afateful effect. By being downplayed as a security risk, Oswald became anunchecked pawn, free to be moved wherever he was useful.Appearing before the Warren Commission, Ruth and Michael Paine seemed confusedand tentative when it came to assigning guilt to Oswald. They both agreed thatwhile he was a man of headstrong convictions, he did not impress them as adangerous sort, and, like George de Mohrenschildt, they said Oswald rather likedKennedy. “I had never thought of him as a violent man,” Ruth testified. “He hadnever said anything against President Kennedy. . . . There was nothing that Ihad seen about him that indicated a man with that kind of grudge or hostility.”Michael—a lean man with sensitive eyes and a soft, watery demeanor—seemedparticularly at sea when he tried to make sense of Oswald. When Dulles asked himif he was convinced that Oswald was the assassin, Michael launched upon arambling, only somewhat coherent reply, winding up with this less-than-decisiveconclusion: “I never did discover—and it didn’t quite make sense, but for themost part, I accept it, the common view that he did it.”In truth, Michael never knew Oswald very well. They only talked at length onabout four occasions, he told the Warren Commission. They would run into eachother some weekends when they visited their wives and kids at the Paine familyhouse in Irving. One evening, Michael took Oswald to a meeting of the localchapter of the ACLU, which the Paines belonged to. Afterward, Lee told Michaelthat he could never join a civil libertarian group like that because it wasn’tsufficiently militant.Neither of the Paines was fond of Oswald. To Ruth, he was an opaque,self-involved, and ill-tempered man who could be cruel to Marina. He was justpart of the equation that she had to put up with in order to have Marina in herlife. “I would have been happy had he never come out, indeed happier had he notcome out on the weekends,” she would testify.Michael and Lee seemed to have more in common—two men who had grown up, for themost part, without fathers, and were now struggling to hold on to their ownfamilies. There was something lost about both young men, a searching qualitythat left them too open to new experience. But they never really hit it off witheach other. Lee was too “dogmatic” for Michael, too set in his Marxist ways. Hereminded him of his distant Trotskyite father, too wrapped up in his adamantpolitical theories to connect with other people.Apart from providing a few suspicious, circumstantial details, this was thePaines’ main contribution to establishing Oswald’s guilt. Guided primarily byWarren Commission lawyers Albert Jenner and Wesley Liebeler—as well as byDulles—the couple painted a portrait of Oswald as a grim subversive.But the Paines also confirmed Oswald’s guilt by just being themselves. Here weretwo left-wing oddballs—their appearance before the panel seemed to signify—a manand woman with peculiar and vaguely seditious family pedigrees. They were justthe type whom you would expect to unwittingly harbor a dangerous man likeOswald. In their immaculate innocence, the Paines played right into the hands ofthose who were manipulating Oswald.The Paines reunited for a time after the assassination but later divorced. Inold age, they now live in the same Quaker retirement compound north of SanFrancisco, connected by the bonds of time. Not long ago, Michael sat down for aninterview at the nearby commune where their middle-aged son, Christopher, andtwo dozen or so others live—a ramshackle collection of cottages in a green gulchnear the Russian River that Ruth calls “a latter-day hippie ranch.” Sitting on alumpy couch in one of the cottages, the retired engineer came across as boyishlycharming and given to whimsical ideas—an “innocent,” as Ruth described him.While serving with the Army in the Korean War, Michael mentioned at one pointduring the afternoon, “I thought of going over to the other side and saying tothe Chinese, ‘We don’t have to fight like this.’ But I thought I’d be blown upif I did. I also thought it would be unlikely I could find someone I could talkto, and they’d put me in a concentration camp. I prefer democracy, but I thoughtcommunism for China was an appropriate thing—they needed to all go in the samedirection.” This is the sort of idiosyncratic thinking that might well have madeMichael Paine stand out to someone like Dulles.The Paines seemed to grow more convinced of Oswald’s guilt over time. Butnowadays Michael is not as cocksure as Ruth. As he talked about those ancient,catastrophic days, he seemed bewildered, like someone trying to explain acollision he had survived long ago. He still wavered back and forth, just as hedid with the Warren Commission. “Oswald wanted to overthrow something, theenemies, capitalists, the oppressors . . . he wanted action, and you had to betough, brutal.” But then again . . . he liked Kennedy. “Oh, he did! He said,‘JFK is my favorite president.’”Michael Paine still does not know what to think. But perhaps, like the rest ofthe country, he has found a kind of comfort in his confusion.As November 22, 1963, dawned—the day John F. Kennedy would die—Allen Dulles wasaway from Washington, as he typically was at the outset of major operations. InSeptember and October, Dulles had maintained the busy schedule of a man still inthe thick of clandestine affairs, meeting with key officials from the CIA’scovert action side such as Desmond Fitzgerald, who—along with DavidPhillips—oversaw the violent intrigue swirling around Cuba; Angleton and hisdeputy, Cord Meyer; and a top Helms aide, Thomas Karamessines. All of these menwould later be connected by investigators, in one way or another, to the Kennedyassassination.But as Friday, November 22, drew near, Dulles spent much of his time away fromhis Georgetown home base. His book tour for The Craft of Intelligence providedthe spymaster with a good excuse to get away from home. In the days leading upto the assassination, he made bookstore and media appearances in Boston and NewYork. Early on the morning of November 22, Dulles caught a Piedmont Airlinesflight back to Washington, landing at National Airport around 8:30 a.m. He wasthen driven to a hotel in Williamsburg, Virginia, where he addressed a BrookingsInstitution breakfast meeting. After receiving the news from Dallas, around 1:30that afternoon, Dulles took a car back to Washington with John Warner, a CIAattorney.But, according to Dulles’s date book, he did not spend the evening at home inWashington. He headed back to the northern Virginia countryside, where he wouldspend the entire weekend at a top secret CIA facility known officially as CampPeary, but within the agency as “the Farm.”At the time of the Kennedy assassination, Dulles had no formal role ingovernment. As far as the public knew, he was a figure of the legendary past, agraying gentleman who supplemented his civil service pension by recyclingcolorful espionage tales of yesteryear and by delivering sobering Cold Warspeeches. But the Farm was not a club for CIA retirees. It was a bustlingclandestine center that Dulles himself had inaugurated soon after taking over asCIA chief, and it served a variety of tightly guarded functions.Before the CIA took over Camp Peary—a sprawling compound in the densely woodedtidelands near Williamsburg—it was used as a Navy Seabees base and then as astockade for captured German sailors. Dulles turned it into a spy training basefor recruits who were headed overseas. According to former CIA agents PhilipAgee and Victor Marchetti, among the well-trained professionals turned out bythe Farm were skilled assassins. The facility was also what would later betermed a “black site”—a secure location where enemy captives and suspiciousdefectors were subjected to extreme interrogation methods.As CIA director, Dulles had built himself a comfortable home at the Farm. Yearslater, consultants like Chalmers Johnson—an Asian affairs expert who became ascorching critic of U.S. empire—would be housed there during agency conferences.Johnson recalled the retired spymaster’s well-stocked library, which—as late as1967—still contained the latest CIA reports, intelligence estimates, andclassified journals.“The Farm was basically an alternative CIA headquarters, from where Dulles coulddirect ops,” said former congressional investigator Dan Hardway.This is the CIA command post where the “retired” Dulles situated himself fromFriday, November 22, through Sunday, November 24—a highly eventful weekendduring which Oswald was arrested and questioned by Dallas police, Kennedy’s bodywas flown back to Washington and subjected to an autopsy riddled withirregularities, and Oswald was gunned down in the basement of the Dallas policestation by a shady nightclub owner.A year after the assassination, Dulles was interviewed by an old CIA colleague,Tom Braden, for the oral history project at the JFK Library in Boston. Bradenasked Dulles what he had thought of Kennedy “as a man.” Dulles put on his maskof mourning and sympathy, as he could do in an instant. “Oh, I rated him high. .. . I shall never forget when I first heard the news of the Dallas tragedy. Ifelt that here is a man who hadn’t had the chance really to show his fullcapabilities, that he was just reaching a point where his grasp of all theintricacies of the presidency were such that now he could move forward.”While serving on the Warren Commission, Dulles told Braden, he had theopportunity to examine the assassination in exquisite detail. He talked aboutthe events of that day as if he were inspecting the inner mechanism of a finewatch. He seemed in awe of the intricate meshing of synchronicities that had tooccur in order for Kennedy to die that day. His description made it sound likethe operation of a lifetime.“If the employees of the Book Depository had eaten their lunch in a littledifferent place,” said Dulles, “if somebody had been at one place where he mighteasily have been instead of another at one particular time—the ‘ifs’ just standout all over it. And if any one of these ‘ifs’ had been changed, it might havebeen prevented. . . . It was so tantalizing to go over that record [of events],as we did, trying to find out every fact connected with the assassination, andthen to say if any one of the chess pieces that were entered into the game hadbeen moved differently, at any one time, the whole thing might have beendifferent.”"},{"pageContent":"20 [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-46]FOR THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-46]In his calendar for October 2, 1963, Dulles penciled in an interestingappointment. “Dillon,” he wrote—by which he meant C. Douglas Dillon, theTreasury secretary and former Wall Street financier. After Dillon’s name, Dullesscrawled “Bank Reps.” There was no further explanation for the scheduledappointment. But the proximity of the meeting to the Kennedy assassinationraises compelling questions, particularly since Dillon, as Treasury chief, wasin charge of President Kennedy’s Secret Service protection. And the bankingindustry was locked in a long-running battle with the president over hiseconomic policies.When it came to undertaking secret missions, Allen Dulles was a bold anddecisive actor. But he acted only after he felt that a consensus had beenreached within his influential network. One of the principal arenas where thisconsensus took shape was the Council on Foreign Relations. The Dulles brothersand their Wall Street circle had dominated this private bastion for shapingpublic policy ever since the 1920s. Over the years, CFR meetings, study groups,and publications provided forums in which the organization’s leadingmembers—including Wall Street bankers and lawyers, prominent politicians, mediaexecutives, and academic dignitaries—hammered out major U.S. policy directions,including the decision to drop atomic bombs on Japan and the Cold War strategyof “containment” aimed at the Soviet Union. The CIA-engineered coup thatoverthrew Guatemala’s democratic government was put in motion by Dulles after aCFR study group urged tough action against Arbenz’s left-wing administration. IfCFR was the power elite’s brain, the CIA was its black-gloved fist.As the global reach of American industry and finance grew during the postwarera, so did the U.S. national security complex. America’s vast system ofmilitary and covert power was aimed not just at checking the Soviet threat butat protecting U.S. corporate interests abroad. Behind the rapid internationalgrowth of multinational giants like Chase Manhattan, Coca-Cola, Standard Oil,and GM lay a global network of U.S. military bases, spy stations, and allianceswith despotic regimes. The twin exigencies of the Cold War and U.S. empire gavethe national security establishment unprecedented free rein to operate. The CIAwas empowered not only to engage in the deadly “spy versus spy” antics againstthe KGB that became the stuff of Cold War legend but to subvert democraticgovernments that were deemed insufficiently pro-American and to terminate thesegovernments’ elected leaders.Dedicated to the dark necessities of expanding American power, this securitycomplex began to take on a hidden life of its own, untethered from the checksand balances of democracy. Sometimes CIA officials kept the White House andCongress informed; often they did not. When John Chancellor of NBC News askedDulles if the CIA made its own policy, the spymaster insisted that during histenure he had regularly briefed congressional committees about the agency’sbudget and operations. But, he added, Congress generally preferred to remainblissfully ignorant of the distasteful things done in the government’s name.“When I appeared before them,” said Dulles, “again and again I’ve been stoppedby members of the Congress, who said, ‘We don’t want to hear about that, wemight talk in our sleep. Don’t tell us this!’”This head-in-the-sand attitude gave men like Dulles enormous leverage to takedrastic action when they felt so inclined. But Dulles was not someout-of-control freebooter within the system of American power. Though hisactions often revealed the knife-cold psyche of a murderer, in many ways heremained a sober-minded corporate lawyer. When he took extreme action—or“executive action” in the CIA’s euphemistic parlance for political murder—he didso with the confidence that he was implementing the will of his circle—not thewill of the people, but of his people.Doug Dillon was the kind of affluent Washington power player Allen Dulleslistened to. Over the years, the Dulles brothers and Dillon grew quite close. Itwas in Dillon’s comfortable Florida retreat, at Hobe Sound, where the dyingFoster spent some of his final days. And Allen was invited to enjoy himself atthe palatial château overlooking the legendary vineyards that the Dillon familyowned in southern France. The week he once spent at the Dillons’ ChâteauHaut-Brion “renewing my acquaintance with my favorite wines from the Bordeauxcountry” was among the most “delightful” memories of his life, Dulles laterwrote Dillon’s wife, Phyllis.When it came to taking executive action, Dulles might have been chairman of theboard, but he answered to a group of men with far more wealth and, in some ways,more power than he had—men like Doug Dillon. Dulles controlled the country’ssecret machinery of violence throughout much of the Cold War, but the spychief’s power came from the fact that—even after his departure from the CIA—hiswealthy sponsors continued to invest him with it. In retirement, Dulles wasstill asked to take prestigious positions with the Princeton Board of Trustees,the Council on Foreign Relations, and various defense advisory and blue-ribboncommittees.Dulles was invited to play leadership roles in these organizations because themen who funded them knew that he shared their aggressive views about maintainingAmerica’s wealth and prestige in the world. The men who sat on Dulles’s board ofdirectors, as it were—the men with whom he discussed major decisions, exchangedcorrespondence, and shared sunny getaways—occupied the very center of Americanpower. Threats to these men’s wealth and stature brought out their lethalimpulses. This is when they turned to Dulles, the gentlemanly enforcer with theice-blue eyes.Nobody occupied a more central position in the Dulles brothers’ power circlethan the Rockefeller brothers. Nelson and David were the most public of the fivegrandsons of John D. Rockefeller—the founder of the Standard Oil behemoth, anunprecedented empire of wealth that would grow to include global banks, miningcompanies, sprawling ranches, and even supermarkets. The glad-handing,irrepressible Nelson would become the cheery face of centrist Republicanpolitics in mid-century America, working as an adviser to President Eisenhoweron Cold War strategy and later becoming a popular governor of New York andperennial factor in Republican presidential equations. His less gregarious andmore analytical younger brother, David, would rise to become chief executive ofthe family’s bank, Chase Manhattan, as well as a leading spokesman forinternational finance. Less well known, both brothers were militant advocates ofU.S. imperial interests, particularly in Latin America, where the Rockefellerfamily had extensive holdings. And they both had backgrounds in U.S.intelligence.During World War II, Nelson did not follow other sons of East Coast high societyinto the OSS. Instead the elder Rockefeller brother, who had a strainedrelationship with top spy Wild Bill Donovan, ran his own private intelligencenetwork in Latin America, as FDR’s south-of-the-border point man. Nelson resumedhis espionage duties under President Eisenhower, who put him in charge of aspecial advisory group that oversaw the CIA. In the press, Rockefeller wasdescribed as Ike’s “Cold War general”—a title that probably said more about thesway that the Rockefeller name had with the media than about Nelson’s actualclout within the administration.Meanwhile, David Rockefeller served with a special Army intelligence unit inAlgeria during World War II, where he was assigned to spy not on Nazis but onthe country’s nascent anticolonial movement. After being transferred to Paris,he was asked to snoop on the Communist Party elements that had played a key rolein the French resistance and were emerging as a strong political force inpostwar France. Rockefeller also set up a spy ring inside the provisionalgovernment of General de Gaulle and soon came to dislike the “arrogance,inflexibility and single-mindedness” of the French war hero.The Dulleses identified the Rockefeller brothers, who were a generation younger,as up-and-coming players, and they sought to bring them into the inner circle ofthe Cold War establishment. Over the years, the two sets of brothers becameclose partners in the country’s game of thrones, helping advance one another’sambitions. The Dulleses ushered David Rockefeller into the Council on ForeignRelations, where he soon became a major force, and Foster would become chairmanof the family-controlled Rockefeller Foundation. The Rockefellers contributedcampaign funds to Dulles-favored Republican candidates, including Foster himselfwhen he ran unsuccessfully for the Senate from New York in 1950. In January1953, while Allen nervously waited to see whether newly inaugurated presidentEisenhower would appoint him CIA director, David took him to lunch in Manhattanand assured him that if things didn’t work out in Washington, he could return toNew York and take over the Ford Foundation, which—like the RockefellerFoundation—Dulles had already used to secretly finance CIA activities. AfterAllen did win control of the spy agency, he again turned to the Rockefellers tohelp finance CIA projects like MKULTRA mind control research.The Rockefeller brothers served as private bankers for Dulles’s intelligenceempire. David, who oversaw the donations committee of the Chase Manhattan BankFoundation, was a particularly important source of off-the-books cash for theCIA. Tom Braden, one of Dulles’s top propaganda men, later recalled David’slargesse. “I often briefed David, semi-officially and with Allen’s permission,”Braden said. “[David] was of the same mind as us, and very approving ofeverything we were doing. He had the same sense as I did that the way to win theCold War was our way. Sometimes David would give me money to do things whichweren’t in our budget. He gave me a lot of money for causes in France. Iremember he gave me $50,000 for someone who was active in promoting an[anti-Communist] united Europe [campaign] amongst European youth groups. Thisguy came to me with his project, and I told David, and David just gave me thecheck for $50,000.”When the ambitious Nelson overreached as Eisenhower’s Cold War adviser and beganto infringe on the Dulles brothers’ territory, Foster became exasperated withhim and succeeded in having him jettisoned from the administration. But Allenmanaged to stay on genial terms with Nelson, and with David, too. As he left theEisenhower White House in December 1955, Nelson sent the CIA chief a gushingletter. “I can’t begin to tell you how much my association with you over thispast year has meant to me,” Nelson told Allen. “I have admired tremendously yourstrength and courage, your understanding, and your penetrating insight into themany problems which confront us. You give yourself quietly and unselfishly, butyour qualities of human understanding have shone forth to give courage to usall. Only a few will ever know how great your contributions have been to thesecurity of our country.”Even Dulles, who had a robust self-regard, seemed stunned by Rockefeller’seffusive praise. “Dear Nelson,” he replied. “To say that I appreciate your kindremarks is an understatement—overwhelmed would be a little more accurate.”Dulles and the Rockefellers continued their mutual courtship over the years,with both sides keenly recognizing the value in the relationship. After his 1958election in New York, Nelson invited Allen to speak at the 1959 conference ofstate governors, which was held in Puerto Rico that year. While there, Dullesstayed at the exclusive Dorado Beach Club, a palm-shaded luxury resort createdby Nelson’s brother, Laurance, on prime coastal real estate owned by theRockefeller family. When he got home, the CIA director wrote Laurance, askinghim to pull strings so that a friend and his wife could become club members, “asthey are both devotees of golf and swimming.” Meanwhile, Dulles supplied theRockefellers with CIA information about global hot zones like Iran, Cuba, andVenezuela, where the family had petroleum interests.Although Jack Kennedy, as a young congressman and senator, often used thelanguage of the Cold War that was the lingua franca of American politics, he wasnever fully accepted within this inner sanctum of power. Members of the Americanelite were uneasy about Kennedy’s presidential bid from the very beginning.Their skepticism started with old Joe Kennedy, the candidate’s father, who wasremembered as an ardent New Dealer—despite his prickly relationship with FDR—andas a banking maverick (or some would say traitor) who had agreed to serve asRoosevelt’s Wall Street watchdog. Nor did the young senator’s provocativecriticisms of Western imperialism inspire confidence in corporate circles, whereaggressive overseas expansion was viewed as American capital’s next greatfrontier. John McCloy, the diplomat and banker known as “the chairman of theestablishment,” could not bring himself to support JFK in 1960, despite the twomen’s shared Irish ancestry. Kennedy’s standoffish attitude toward the Councilon Foreign Relations crowd put off McCloy, who was the organization’s chairmanat the time. While McCloy found Nixon hard to warm up to, he dismissed Kennedyas a lightweight who had not been properly indoctrinated in the ways of theAmerican establishment.If the establishment harbored suspicions about the Kennedy family, the feelingswere mutual. Despite his privileged upbringing, JFK had imbibed his father’sbitter feelings as an Irish Catholic outsider. After he narrowly won thepresidency, Kennedy told his aide Theodore Sorensen that he suspected that WallStreet bankers had tried to sabotage his election by spreading word that hiselection would set off a financial panic.In public, President Kennedy tried to defuse Wall Street hostility against himwith his dry wit. During a June 1962 press conference, Kennedy was asked about anews report that big business was using the current stock market slump “as ameans of forcing you to come to terms with business. . . . [Their] attitude isnow they have you where they want you.” After a well-timed pause, Kennedyreplied, “I can’t believe I’m where business—big business—wants me,” to gales oflaughter from the press auditorium. But, as usual, there was a point—an edge—toJFK’s humor. After the laughter died down, he drove home his message, making itclear that he would regard any such corporate sabotage of the economy as beyondthe pale of acceptable politics.The growing gulf between Kennedy and the corporate class was epitomized by theincreasingly fractious relationship between JFK and the Rockefeller brothers.Kennedy’s domestic and foreign policies posed a direct threat to the Rockefellerdynasty on multiple fronts, and, considering the central role in U.S. financeand industry played by the network of Rockefeller interests, any such threatswere viewed by the business community as challenges to American capitalismitself.Kennedy’s tax reform policies, which sought to place a heavier burden on thesuperrich, were a primary source of friction. When the president—who wasconcerned about the flight of capital in the emerging era of the globalmarket—tried to crack down on overseas tax shelters, international bankers likeDavid Rockefeller cried foul. Wall Street financiers saw the Kennedy move as anassault on their ability to transfer wealth to any corner of the globe as theysaw fit.Walter Wriston—the rising young leader of First National City Bank, and DavidRockefeller’s chief competitor in the global finance arena—frankly expressedWall Street’s frustration with Kennedy. “Who is this upstart presidentinterfering with the free flow of capital?” he demanded to know. “You can’t damcapital.”While many Wall Street executives complained bitterly about JFK in private,David Rockefeller took it upon himself to challenge the president’s economicpolicies in public. Henry Luce helped elevate Rockefeller as a Kennedyantagonist by giving the two men a debate forum in Life, the picture magazine ofthe American masses. The magazine’s introduction to the piece touted the youngbanker as “an eloquent and logical articulator for the sophisticated businesscommunity.” In the open “businessman’s letter” to Kennedy that followed,Rockefeller took issue with the president’s tax policies, which he insisted puttoo much burden on the investor class, and demanded “a material reduction in thecorporate income tax rate.” The banker also took the president to task for hissocial spending, urging him to cut expenditures and make a “vigorous effort tobalance the budget.”The Rockefellers were perhaps even more alarmed by Kennedy’s foreignpolicies—particularly in Latin America, which was not only home to the family’soil and real estate holdings but also the primary target for Chase Manhattan’soverseas expansion. It seemed like an affront to the Rockefellers’ southerndominion when Kennedy announced the Alliance for Progress in March 1961, amassive foreign aid program for Latin America designed to stimulate economicgrowth, redistribute wealth, and promote democratic governments in the region.The alliance was spearheaded by Richard Goodwin, one of JFK’s youngest and mostardent New Frontiersmen. And White House officials made no secret that theprogram was designed not only to counter Castro’s revolutionary appeal in thearea but also to sideline the corporate interests that had long been exploitingthe impoverished hemisphere.Goodwin began pushing a variety of measures, which, by the standards of thepro-business Eisenhower era, were decidedly radical, including providingequipment for nationalized mines in Bolivia and offering U.S. governmentfinancing to state-run oil companies—“even if Standard Oil and David Rockefellerobjected,” added Kennedy’s young Turk. Soon enough, the corporate pushback—alongwith the inevitable Republican Party and media fireworks—did come. “Neither U.S.nor Latin American businessmen took kindly to indications by Richard Goodwin,the president’s chief Latin American adviser, that he thought private enterprisehad a bad connotation in Latin America because it is associated with U.S.imperialism,” harrumphed a business newsletter specializing in coverage ofsouth-of-the-border investments.Under increasing political pressure, JFK finally caved on Goodwin, transferringhim from the Alliance for Progress to the Peace Corps. But Kennedy continued toresist efforts to privatize the alliance led by David Rockefeller. America’sreputation in Latin America as an imperial bully mortified Kennedy. He was sickof the U.S. government being seen “as the representative of private business,”he told Goodwin. He was tired of Washington propping up “tinhorn dictators” andcorrupt regimes in countries like Chile where “American copper companies controlabout 80 percent of all the foreign exchange. We wouldn’t stand for that here.And there’s no reason they should stand for it. . . . There’s a revolution goingon down there, and I want to be on the right side of it.”Kennedy’s Latin American policies continued to be a point of contention betweenthe Rockefeller brothers and him for the rest of his presidency. Even afterJFK’s death, his brother continued to fight the battle. During a 1965 tour ofLatin America, Robert Kennedy—by then a senator from New York—found himself in aheated discussion about Rockefeller influence in Latin America, during anevening at the home of a Peruvian artist that had been arranged by Goodwin. WhenBobby brashly suggested to the gathering that Peru should “assert [its]nationhood” and nationalize its oil industry, the group was stunned. “Why, DavidRockefeller has just been down here,” one guest said. “And he told us therewouldn’t be any aid if anyone acted against International Petroleum [a localStandard Oil subsidiary].”“Oh come on, David Rockefeller isn’t the government,” Bobby shot back, stillplaying the role of Kennedy family tough guy. “We Kennedys eat Rockefellers forbreakfast.”The Kennedys were indeed more successful at the rough-and-tumble of politicsthan the Rockefellers. But, as JFK had understood, that was not the full storywhen it came to evaluating a family’s power. He fully appreciated that theRockefellers held a unique place in the pantheon of American power, one rootednot so much within the democratic system as within what scholars would laterrefer to as “the deep state”—that subterranean network of financial,intelligence, and military interests that guided national policy no matter whooccupied the White House. The Kennedys had risen from saloonkeepers and wardheelers to the top of American politics. But they were still overshadowed by theimperial power of the Rockefellers.JFK always displayed a sharp curiosity about the much wealthier family, pumpingmutual friends—like presidential adviser Adolf Berle—for inside informationabout the Rockefellers. Jack and David had been contemporaries at Harvard, butas David was quick to point out, “we moved in very different circles.” AsKennedy pursued his own career, he always kept one wary eye on the politicallyambitious Nelson, who had openly proclaimed his desire to occupy the WhiteHouse. It was an ambition he nursed “ever since I was a kid,” he once said.“After all, when you think of what I had, what else was there to aspire to?”Nelson let slip his cheery facade only when contemplating looming threats to hisfamily’s wealth. He had long fretted about “losing our property” to nationalistmovements overseas. When Castro gave a bearded face to these fears,expropriating the Standard Oil refinery and other Rockefeller properties inCuba, Nelson was outraged. He grew increasingly frustrated with Kennedy as hesidestepped opportunities to invade Cuba, becoming convinced that the presidenthad cut a deal with the Russians to leave Castro alone.It was Nelson’s growing sense of Kennedy as a Cold War “appeaser” that drove himto begin mounting a presidential challenge for 1964. In his final politicalspeeches before the Kennedy assassination, Rockefeller lashed into the presidentfor his “indecision, vacillation and weakness” in foreign policy. The Kennedyadministration’s dynamic image was a public relations myth, Rockefellerinsisted. In truth, he charged, JFK’s unassertive leadership had encouraged ourenemies and demoralized our allies, and had made the world more dangerous.These views of Kennedy were widely echoed in the pages of the business press,where JFK was portrayed as a soft-spined commander in chief who was putting thecountry at risk and, in the estimation of The Wall Street Journal, anincompetent economic manager with a pronounced hostility to “the philosophy offreedom.” Like the Luce press, the Journal became increasingly vitriolic in itsdescriptions of the president, describing him as an enemy of big business and asa hopeless left-wing romantic “living in a dream world” and laboring under thespell of “deep and damaging delusion.” In short, Kennedy was seen as an aberrantpresident in elite circles—an unqualified man who, it was broadly hinted, hadbarely squeezed into office thanks to the underhanded dealings of hisMafia-connected father.The attitudes toward Kennedy were even more rabid in national security chambers,where men like Angleton and LeMay regarded the president as a degenerate, andvery likely a traitor. If the Soviets launched a sneak nuclear attack onAmerica, Angleton brooded, the Kennedys would be safely cocooned “in theirluxury bunker, presumably watching World War III on television, [while] the restof us . . . burned in hell.”Angleton seemed obsessed with Kennedy’s sex life. He reportedly bugged JFK’sWhite House trysts with Mary Meyer, the ex-wife of his deputy, Cord Meyer—anartistic blond beauty with whom Angleton himself was enamored. He told friendsand family that Kennedy’s rule was marked by sexual decadence, as well ascriminality—a particularly ironic twist, since Angleton himself was laterrevealed to have been connected to the Mafia ever since his wartime days inRome.Over the final months of JFK’s presidency, a clear consensus took shape withinAmerica’s deep state: Kennedy was a national security threat. For the good ofthe country, he must be removed. And Dulles was the only man with the stature,connections, and decisive will to make something of this enormity happen. He hadalready assembled a killing machine to operate overseas. Now he prepared tobring it home to Dallas. All that his establishment colleagues had to do was tolook the other way—as they always did when Dulles took executive action.In the case of Doug Dillon—who oversaw Kennedy’s Secret Service apparatus—itsimply meant making sure that he was out of town. At the end of October, Dillonnotified the president that he planned to take a “deferred summer vacation” inNovember, abandoning his Washington post for Hobe Sound until the eighteenth ofthe month. After that, Dillon informed Kennedy, he planned to fly to Tokyo withother cabinet members on an official visit that would keep him out of thecountry from November 21 to November 27. If he was later asked to account forhimself, Dillon would have a ready explanation. The tragic events in Dallas hadnot occurred on his watch; he was airborne over the Pacific at the time.There is no evidence that reigning corporate figures like David Rockefeller werepart of the plot against President Kennedy or had foreknowledge of the crime.But there is ample evidence of the overwhelming hostility to Kennedy in thesecorporate circles—a surging antagonism that certainly emboldened Dulles andother national security enemies of the president. And if the assassination ofPresident Kennedy was indeed an “establishment crime,” as University ofPittsburgh sociology professor Donald Gibson has suggested, there is even morereason to see the official investigation as an establishment cover-up.Oswald was still alive, and that was a problem. He was supposed to be killed ashe left the Texas School Book Depository. That’s what G. Robert Blakey, theformer Kennedy Justice Department attorney who served as chief counsel for theHouse Select Committee on Assassinations, later concluded about the manauthorities rushed to designate the lone assassin. But Oswald escaped, and afterbeing taken alive by Dallas police in a movie theater, he became a majorconundrum for those trying to pin the crime on him.To begin with, Oswald did not act like most assassins. Those who decapitatedheads of state generally crowed about their history-making deeds (Sic sempertyrannis! ). In contrast, Oswald repeatedly denied his guilt while in custody,emphatically telling reporters as he was hustled from one room to the next inthe Dallas police station, “I don’t know what this is all about. . . . I’m justa patsy!” And the accused assassin seemed strangely cool and collected,according to the police detectives who questioned him. “He was real calm,”recalled one detective. “He was extra calm. He wasn’t a bit excited or nervousor anything.” In fact, Dallas police chief Jesse Curry and district attorneyWilliam Alexander thought Oswald was so composed that he seemed trained tohandle a stressful interrogation. “I was amazed that a person so young wouldhave had the self-control he had,” Alexander later told Irish investigativejournalist Anthony Summers. “It was almost as if he had been rehearsed orprogrammed to meet the situation he found himself in.”Oswald further signaled that he was part of an intelligence operation by tryingto make an intriguing phone call shortly before midnight East Coast time onSaturday, November 23. The police switchboard operator, who was being closelymonitored by two unidentified officials, told Oswald there was no answer, thoughshe actually did not put through the call. It was not until years later thatindependent researchers traced the phone number that Oswald tried to call to aformer U.S. Army intelligence officer in Raleigh, North Carolina. CIA veteranVictor Marchetti, who analyzed the Raleigh call in his book, The CIA and theCult of Intelligence, surmised that Oswald was likely following his trainingguidelines and reaching out to his intelligence handler. “[He] was probablycalling his cut-out. He was calling somebody who could put him in touch with hiscase officer.”The Raleigh call probably sealed Oswald’s fate, according to Marchetti. Byrefusing to play the role of the “patsy” and instead following his intelligenceprotocol, Oswald made clear that he was trouble. What would be the CIA procedureat this point, Marchetti was asked by North Carolina historian Grover Proctor,who has closely studied this episode near the end of Oswald’s life? “I’d killhim,” Marchetti replied. “Was this his death warrant?” Proctor continued. “Youbetcha,” Marchetti said. “This time, [Oswald] went over the dam, whether he knewit or not. . . . He was over the dam. At this point it was executive action.”Oswald was not just alive on the afternoon of November 22, 1963; he was likelyinnocent. This was another major problem for the organizers of theassassination. Even close legal observers of the case who continue to believe inOswald’s guilt—such as Bob Blakey who, after serving on the House AssassinationsCommittee, became a law professor at Notre Dame University—acknowledge that a“credible” case could have been made for Oswald’s innocence based on theevidence. (The 1979 congressional report found that Kennedy was the victim of aconspiracy involving Oswald and other unknown parties.) Other legal experts,like San Francisco attorney and Kennedy researcher Bill Simpich, have gonefurther, arguing that the case against Oswald was riddled with such glaringinconsistencies that it would have quickly unraveled in court.As Simpich has detailed, the ballistics evidence alone was a mess. The bulletsand shells from the crime scene did not match the murder weapon and were poorlymarked by law enforcement officers. The so-called magic bullet that deliveredthe fatal blow to Kennedy’s skull before proceeding on its improbable courselater turned up just as magically, in nearly pristine condition, on a stretcherat Parkland Memorial Hospital where the fatally wounded president was rushed.Then there was the alleged murder weapon—a $19.95 Italian military surplus riflefrom World War II with a faulty sight. Using such a clumsy tool to pull off thecrime of the century with rapid-fire precision—especially in the hands of amarksman who had a hard time shooting rabbits—simply defied the imagination.There was also the fact that FBI technicians who tested the Mannlicher-Carcanorifle could find none of Oswald’s prints on the weapon, and the Dallas policefailed to detect any trace of gunpowder on the arrested man’s cheek, whichindicated that he had not fired a rifle that day.In addition, Buell Wesley Frazier, the young Texas School Book Depositoryemployee who drove Oswald to work that morning, insisted that the package thealleged assassin carried into the building that day was not big enough tocontain a rifle. The nineteen-year-old Frazier refused to change his story,despite being arrested and subjected to a withering interrogation by Dallaspolice, including threats to charge him as a co-conspirator. “I was interrogatedfor many, many hours—interrogators would rotate,” Frazier recalled years later.“The way they treated me that day, I have a hard time understanding that. I wasjust a rural boy; I had never been in trouble with the law. I was doing my bestto answer their questions.” He could never figure out in his own mind whetherOswald was guilty or not. But there was one thing he knew for certain, he told anewspaper reporter fifty years later: the brown paper package that Oswald put onthe backseat of his car on the morning of November 22, 1963, did not hold arifle. “There is no way it would fit in that package.”And then there was the inconvenient home movie taken by dress manufacturerAbraham Zapruder, as Kennedy’s limousine passed by him in Dealey Plaza. The filmcaptured the moments JFK was struck by gunfire in gruesome detail and—along withthe testimony of dozens of eyewitnesses—graphically demonstrated that bulletswere fired from the front, as well as the rear, of the presidential motorcade.As many as twenty-one law enforcement officers stationed in the plaza—mentrained in the use of firearms—said their immediate reaction to the sound of thegunfire was to go search the area looming in front of Kennedy’s advancinglimousine, the tree-topped rise that would become famously known as “the grassyknoll.” Even if Oswald did shoot at the president, this meant that there was atleast one other gunman and Kennedy was the victim of a conspiracy. The CIA’s ownstate-of-the-art photography analysis unit came to this conclusion afteranalyzing the Zapruder film. (FBI analysts would later concur.) But the CIAtechnicians’ report was quickly suppressed.The surgeons who labored futilely over the mortally wounded president atParkland Hospital also saw clear evidence that Kennedy had been struck bygunfire from the front as well as the rear. But the doctors came under severepressure to remain silent and it would take nearly three decades before two ofthem mustered the courage to speak out.Fortunately for the conspirators, the deeply flawed case against Lee HarveyOswald never made it to court. The Oswald problem was abruptly eliminated on themorning of Sunday, November 24, when the accused assassin was shot in thestomach in the basement of the Dallas police station while in the process ofbeing transferred to the county jail. He died two hours later in the sameemergency room where President Kennedy was pronounced dead.Oswald’s shocking murder—broadcast live into America’s homes—solved one dilemmafor Dulles, as he monitored the Dallas events that weekend from the Farm, hissecure CIA facility in Virginia. But it soon became apparent that Oswald’smurder created another problem—a wave of public suspicion that swept over thenation and beyond. Jack Ruby, Oswald’s killer—a stocky, fedora-wearing nightcluboperator—looked like a triggerman right out of a B-movie. Ruby even sounded likea Hollywood gangster as he gunned down Oswald, snarling, “You killed mypresident, you rat!” To many people who watched the horrifying spectacle on TV,the shooting smacked of a gangland hit aimed at silencing Oswald before he couldtalk.In fact, this is precisely what Attorney General Robert Kennedy concluded afterhis investigators began digging into Ruby’s background. Bobby, who had made hispolitical reputation as a Senate investigator of organized crime, pored overRuby’s phone records from the days leading up to the Dallas violence. “The list[of names] was almost a duplicate of the people I called before the RacketsCommittee,” RFK later remarked. The attorney general’s suspicions about thedeath of his brother immediately fell not just on the Mafia, but on the CIA—theagency that, as Bobby knew, had been using the mob to do some of its dirtiestwork.Robert Kennedy was not the only one in Washington who immediately sensed aconspiracy behind the killing of his brother. The nation’s capital was filledwith edgy chatter about the assassination. Talking on the phone with Kennedyfamily confidant Bill Walton, Agnes Meyer, the outspoken mother of WashingtonPost publisher Katharine Graham, snapped, “What is this—some kind of goddambanana republic?” Eisenhower, retired on his Gettysburg farm, had the samereaction. He remarked that the bloodshed in Dallas reminded him of his tour ofduty in Haiti as a young Army major; when he visited the national palace inPort-au-Prince, he was shocked to realize that two-thirds of the former heads ofstate whose marble busts were on display had been slain in office.Meanwhile, down in Independence, Missouri, another retired president, HarryTruman, was fuming about the CIA. On December 22, 1963, while the country wasstill reeling from the gunfire in Dallas, Truman published a highly provocativeop-ed article in The Washington Post, charging that the CIA had grown alarminglyout of control since he established it. His original purpose, wrote Truman, wasto create an agency that simply coordinated the various streams of sensitiveinformation flowing into the White House. “I have never had any thought thatwhen I set up the CIA that it would be injected into peacetime cloak and daggeroperations,” he continued. But “for some time, I have been disturbed by the wayCIA has been diverted from its original assignment. It has become an operationaland at times a policy-making arm of Government.” The CIA had grown “so removedfrom its intended role that it is being interpreted as a symbol of sinister andmysterious foreign intrigue.” But the increasingly powerful agency did not justmenace foreign governments, Truman warned—it now threatened democracy at home.“There is something about the way the CIA has been functioning that is casting ashadow over our historic position [as a] free and open society,” he concludedominously, “and I feel that we need to correct it.”The timing of Truman’s opinion piece was striking. Appearing in the capital’sleading newspaper exactly one month after the assassination, the article causedshock waves in political circles. There was a disturbing undertone to thestraight-talking midwesterner’s warning about the CIA. Was Truman implying thatthere was “sinister and mysterious intrigue” behind Kennedy’s death? Could thathave been what he meant when he suggested that the agency represented a growingdanger to our own democracy?Overseas, the speculation about Kennedy’s murder—and the suspicious shooting ofhis alleged assassin—was even more rampant. The foreign press was filled withcommentary suggesting that there were powerful forces involved in theassassination and naming Cold War militarists, big business, and Texas oilmen aspossible culprits. Some of this coverage, unsurprisingly, came from Soviet blocnewspapers, eager to dispel the rumors that Oswald was part of a Communistplot—rumors that were often traceable to CIA propaganda shops. But much of theconjecture about Dallas came from publications in the Western European alliance.In Hamburg, the daily Die Welt editorialized that the official handling of theKennedy and Oswald cases left a “forest of question marks.” In London, the DailyMail spoke of “whispers” that Oswald was a fall guy who was rubbed out, and theDaily Telegraph derided Police Chief Curry’s announcement that Oswald’s deathput a close to the Kennedy case as a “monumental absurdity.” And in Italy, wherethe limitations of the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle were well known to a generationof World War II veterans, the newspaper Corriere Lombardo observed that therewas no way Oswald could have used the bolt-action weapon to squeeze off threeshots in six seconds, as official reports from Dallas were claiming.Suspicions of a conspiracy were particularly strong in France, where Presidentde Gaulle himself had been the target of CIA machinations and had survived abarrage of gunfire on his own limousine. After returning from Kennedy’s November24 funeral in Washington, de Gaulle gave a remarkably candid assessment of theassassination to his information minister, Alain Peyrefitte. “What happened toKennedy is what nearly happened to me,” confided the French president. “Hisstory is the same as mine. . . . It looks like a cowboy story, but it’s only anOAS [Secret Army Organization] story. The security forces were in cahoots withthe extremists.”As a matter of survival, de Gaulle and his loyal deputies had been compelled toinvestigate the underworld where intelligence forces, political zealots, andgangsters all converged. More than any other Western leader, he was well awareof how security services—in the name of combating Communism—joined hands withsome of the most extreme and vicious allies to win their goals. De Gaulle wasconvinced that Kennedy had fallen victim to the same forces that had triedrepeatedly to kill him.“Do you think Oswald was a front?” Peyrefitte asked de Gaulle.“Everything leads me to believe it,” he replied. “They got their hands on thiscommunist who wasn’t one, while still being one. He had a sub par intellect andwas an exalted fanatic—just the man they needed, the perfect one to be accused.. . . The guy ran away, because he probably became suspicious. They wanted tokill him on the spot before he could be grabbed by the judicial system.Unfortunately, it didn’t happen exactly the way they had probably planned itwould. . . . But a trial, you realize, is just terrible. People would havetalked. They would have dug up so much! They would have unearthed everything.Then the security forces went looking for [a clean-up man] they totallycontrolled, and who couldn’t refuse their offer, and that guy sacrificed himselfto kill the fake assassin—supposedly in defense of Kennedy’s memory!“Baloney! Security forces all over the world are the same when they do this kindof dirty work. As soon as they succeed in wiping out the false assassin, theydeclare that the justice system no longer need be concerned, that no furtherpublic action was needed now that the guilty perpetrator was dead. Better toassassinate an innocent man than to let a civil war break out. Better aninjustice than disorder.“America is in danger of upheavals. But you’ll see. All of them together willobserve the law of silence. They will close ranks. They’ll do everything tostifle any scandal. They will throw Noah’s cloak over these shameful deeds. Inorder to not lose face in front of the whole world. In order to not riskunleashing riots in the United States. In order to preserve the union and toavoid a new civil war. In order to not ask themselves questions. They don’t wantto know. They don’t want to find out. They won’t allow themselves to find out.”These astonishing observations about Dallas were captured in Peyrefitte’smemoir, C’était de Gaulle (It Was de Gaulle), which was published in France in2002, three years after the author’s death. Snippets of the conversationappeared in the U.S. press, but the book was not translated and published inAmerica, and de Gaulle’s remarks about the Kennedy assassination were neverfully reported outside of France.A half century later, this extraordinary commentary by the French leader—apolitical colossus of the twentieth century—remains one of the most disturbingand insightful perspectives on this traumatic American event. They don’t want tofind out. They won’t allow themselves to find out.Allen Dulles knew the danger of words, the wrong kind of words. As CIA director,he had spent an untold fortune each year on countering the Soviet propagandamachine and controlling the world’s conversation, including the political andmedia dialogue in his own country. Within minutes of the Kennedy assassination,the CIA tried to steer news reporting and commentary about Dallas, plantingstories that suggested—falsely—that Oswald was a Soviet agent or that Castro wasbehind JFK’s murder. In actuality, both Khrushchev—who broke down weeping in theKremlin when he heard the news—and Castro were deeply distressed by Kennedy’sdeath. Both men had been greatly encouraged by Kennedy’s peace initiatives inthe final year of his presidency, and they feared that his assassination meantthat military hard-liners would take control in Washington. “This is bad news,”Castro muttered to a visiting French journalist, who was carrying an olivebranch from Kennedy when the Cuban leader was informed of the gunfire in Texas.“Everything is changed.”Castro immediately predicted that the agency would try to pin the murder on him.And sure enough, as the Cuban leader and French journalist listened to U.S.radio, a broadcaster suddenly connected Oswald to the Fair Play for CubaCommittee.But despite the CIA’s strenuous efforts, press coverage of the Kennedyassassination began spinning out of its control. Dulles knew that immediatesteps must be taken to contain the conversation. One of his first concerns wasthe Washington echo chamber itself. He quickly realized the danger posed byTruman’s explosive piece in The Washington Post, which instantly caught fire andinspired similar anti-CIA editorials in newspapers from Charlotte, NorthCarolina, to Sacramento, California. Syndicated columnist Richard Starnes, abête noire of the spy agency, used the Truman op-ed to launch a broadsideagainst the CIA, calling it “a cloudy organism of uncertain purpose andappalling power.” Meanwhile, Senator Eugene McCarthy, another agency critic,weighed in with an essay for The Saturday Evening Post—the popularmiddle-American magazine that featured the homespun art of NormanRockwell—bluntly titled, “The CIA Is Getting Out of Hand.”There was no telling how far the media whirlwind would go and what it would stirup. The frenzy of criticism that was suddenly directed at the CIA’scloak-and-dagger operations seemed to be connected, if only subliminally, to thebillowing anxiety that the public felt about the unsolved mysteries in Dallas.If Harry Truman—the man who created the CIA—was worried that it had become aFrankenstein, it might be only a matter of time before prominent Europeanfigures, and even some stray voices in America, began to question whether theagency was behind JFK’s murder.It was Dulles himself who jumped in to put out the Truman fire. Soon after thePost published Truman’s diatribe, Dulles began a campaign to get the retiredpresident to disavow his opinion piece. The spymaster began by enlisting thehelp of Washington power attorney Clark Clifford, the former Truman counselorwho chaired President Johnson’s intelligence advisory board. The CIA “was reallyHST’s baby or at least his adopted child,” Dulles pointed out in a letter toClifford. Perhaps the attorney could talk some sense into the tough old bird andget him to retract his harsh criticisms of the agency.Dulles also appealed directly to Truman in a strongly worded letter, telling theformer president that he was “deeply disturbed” by his article. In theeight-page letter that he mailed on January 7, 1964, Dulles tried to implicateTruman himself. Calling Truman the “father of our modern intelligence system,”Dulles reminded him that it was “you, through National Security Council action,[who] approved the organization in CIA of a new office to carry out covertoperations.” So, Dulles continued, Truman’s ill-advised rant in the Postamounted to “a repudiation of a policy” that the former president himself “hadthe great courage and wisdom to initiate.”To an extent, Dulles had a point. As the spymaster pointed out, the TrumanDoctrine had indeed authorized an aggressive strategy aimed at thwartingCommunist advances in Western Europe, including CIA intervention in the 1948Italian elections. But Truman was correct in charging that, under Eisenhower,Dulles had led the CIA much deeper into skulduggery than he ever envisioned.Unmoved by Dulles’s letter, Truman stood by his article. Realizing the threatthat Truman posed, Dulles continued his crusade to discredit the Post essay wellinto the following year. Confident of his powers of persuasion, the spymastermade a personal trek to Independence, Missouri, in April, arranging to meetface-to-face with Truman at his presidential library. After exchanging a fewminutes of small talk about the old days, Dulles mounted his assault on Truman,employing his usual mix of sweet talk and arm-twisting. But Truman—even on thebrink of turning eighty—was no pushover, and Dulles’s efforts proved fruitless.Still, Dulles would not accept defeat. Unable to alter reality, he simplyaltered the record, like any good spy. On April 21, 1964, upon returning toWashington, Dulles wrote a letter about his half-hour meeting with Truman to CIAgeneral counsel Lawrence Houston. During their conversation at the TrumanLibrary, Dulles claimed in his letter, the elderly ex-president seemed “quiteastounded” by his own attack on the CIA when the spymaster showed him a copy ofthe Post article. As he looked it over, Truman reacted as if he were reading itfor the first time, according to Dulles. “He said that [the article] was allwrong. He then said that he felt it had made a very unfortunate impression.”The Truman portrayed in Dulles’s letter seemed to be suffering from senility andeither could not remember what he had written or had been taken advantage of byan aide, who perhaps wrote the piece under the former president’s name. In fact,CIA officials later did try to blame a Truman assistant for writing theprovocative opinion piece. Truman “obviously was highly disturbed at theWashington Post article,” concluded Dulles in his letter, “. . . and severaltimes said he would see what he could do about it.”The Dulles letter to Houston—which was clearly intended for the CIA files, to beretrieved whenever expedient—was an outrageous piece of disinformation. Truman,who would live for eight more years, was still of sound mind in April 1964. Andhe could not have been shocked by the contents of his own article, since he hadbeen expressing the same views about the CIA—even more strongly—to friends andjournalists for some time.After the Bay of Pigs, Truman had confided in writer Merle Miller that heregretted ever establishing the CIA. “I think it was a mistake,” he said. “Andif I’d known what was going to happen, I never would have done it. . . .[Eisenhower] never paid any attention to it, and it got out of hand. . . . It’sbecome a government all of its own and all secret. . . . That’s a very dangerousthing in a democratic society.” Likewise, after the Washington Post essay ran,Truman’s original CIA director, Admiral Sidney Souers—who shared his formerboss’s limited concept of the agency—congratulated him for writing the piece. “Iam happy as I can be that my article on the Central Intelligence Agency rang abell with you because you know why the organization was set up,” Truman wroteback to Souers.In a letter that Truman wrote to Look magazine managing editor William Arthur inJune 1964—two months after his meeting with Dulles—the ex-president againarticulated his concerns about the direction taken by the CIA after he left theWhite House. “The CIA was set up by me for the sole purpose of getting all theavailable information to the President,” wrote Truman. “It was not intended tooperate as an international agency engaged in strange activities.”Dulles’s relentless effort to manipulate Truman—and failing that, the Trumanrecord—is yet one more example of the spymaster’s “strange activities.” ButDulles’s greatest success at reconstructing reality was still to come. With theWarren Report, Dulles would literally rewrite history. The inquest into thedeath of John F. Kennedy was another astounding sleight of hand on Dulles’spart. The man who should have been in the witness chair wound up instead incontrol of the inquiry.How did Allen Dulles—a man fired by President Kennedy under bittercircumstances—come to oversee the investigation into his murder? This crucialhistorical question has been the subject of misguided speculation for manyyears. The story apparently began with Lyndon Johnson, a man not known for hisdevotion to the truth. It has been repeated over time by various historians,including Johnson biographer Robert Caro, who one would think would be moreskeptical, considering the exhaustive detail with which he documented LBJ’shabitual deceit in his multivolume work.In his 1971 memoir, Johnson wrote that he appointed Dulles and John McCloy tothe Warren Commission because they were “the two men Bobby Kennedy asked me toput on it.” With Bobby safely dead by 1971, LBJ clearly felt that he could getaway with this one. But the idea that LBJ would huddle with the man heconsidered his rival and tormentor, in order to discuss the politicallysensitive composition of the commission, is ludicrous.The Warren Commission’s inquiry had the ability to shake the new Johnsonpresidency—and the U.S. government itself—to their very core. In making hischoices for the commission, Johnson later wrote, he sought “men who were knownto be beyond pressure and above suspicion.” What LBJ really wanted was men whocould be trusted to close the case and put the public’s suspicions to rest. TheWarren Commission was not established to find the truth but to “lay the dust”that had been stirred up in Dallas, as McCloy stated—“dust not only in theUnited States, but all over the world.”Equally preposterous is the notion that Bobby Kennedy would nominate Dulles andMcCloy—two men who had fallen out with President Kennedy while serving on hisnational security team—to investigate his brother’s murder. Like Dulles, whoseformer agency Bobby immediately suspected of a role in the assassination, McCloywas a Cold War hard-liner. McCloy had resigned as JFK’s chief arms negotiator atthe end of 1962, in frustration with what he felt was Soviet intransigence. Butit was McCloy himself who was the obstacle. Several months after Kennedyreplaced him with Averell Harriman—a man the Russians trusted—the twosuperpowers reached a historic agreement to limit nuclear arms testing.McCloy, who had served as chairman of Chase Manhattan before David Rockefellermoved into the bank’s leadership role, was closely aligned with Rockefellerinterests. After leaving the Kennedy administration, McCloy joined a Wall Streetlaw firm where he represented anti-Kennedy oilmen Clint Murchison and SidRichardson, with whom he had done business since his days at Chase Manhattan.It was the national security establishment, not Bobby Kennedy, that advised thenew president to put Dulles and McCloy on the Warren Commission. AndJohnson—finely tuned to the desires of the men who had put him in the OvalOffice—wisely obliged them.The Dulles camp itself made no bones about the fact that the Old Managgressively lobbied to get appointed to the commission. Dick Helms later toldhistorian Michael Kurtz that he “personally persuaded” Johnson to appointDulles. According to Kurtz, Dulles and Helms “wanted to make sure no agencysecrets came out during the investigation. . . . And, of course, if Dulles wason the commission, that would ensure the agency would be safe. Johnson felt thesame way—he didn’t want the investigation to dig up anything strange.”William Corson, a former Marine Corps officer and Navy intelligence agent whowas close to Dulles, confirmed that the spymaster pulled strings to get on theWarren Commission. He “lobbied hard for the job,” recalled Corson, who hadcommanded young Allen Jr. in the Korean War. After he took his place on thecommission, Dulles recruited Corson to explore the Jack Ruby angle. Afterspending months pursuing various leads, Corson eventually concluded that he hadbeen sent on a wild-goose chase. “It is entirely possible I was sent on anassignment which would go nowhere. . . . Allen Dulles had a lot to hide.”Among those urging Johnson to give Dulles the Warren Commission job wereestablishment allies like Secretary of State Dean Rusk, former president of theRockefeller Foundation. These same voices were raised on behalf of McCloy. Infact, the commission was, from the very beginning, an establishment creation. Itwas sold to an initially reluctant LBJ by the most influential voices of theWashington power structure, including Joe Alsop—the CIA’s ever-dependablemouthpiece—and the editorial czars of The Washington Post and The New YorkTimes. Johnson wanted the investigation handled by officials in Texas, where hefelt more in control, instead of by a “bunch of carpetbaggers.” But in a phonecall to the White House on the morning of November 25, Alsop deftly maneuveredJohnson into accepting the idea of a presidential commission made up ofnationally renowned figures “beyond any possible suspicion.”When Johnson clung to his idea of a Texas investigation, the sophisticated Alsopset him straight, as if lecturing a country simpleton. “My lawyers, though, Joe,tell me that the White House—the president—must not inject himself into localkillings,” LBJ said, almost pleadingly. “I agree with that,” Alsop said as hesmoothly cut him off, “but in this case it does happen to be the killing of thepresident.”Dulles immediately accepted Johnson’s request to join the commission when thepresident phoned him on the evening of November 29. “I would like to be of anyhelp,” Dulles told Johnson, though he did feel compelled to at least raise thepropriety of appointing a former CIA director who was known to have a troubledrelationship with the deceased president: “And you’ve considered the work of myprevious work and my previous job?” Dulles asked inelegantly.“I sure have,” LBJ replied, “and we want you to do it. That’s that. . . . Youalways do what is best for your country. I found that out about you a long timeago.”In the end, it all worked out just as the Washington establishment wanted—and asde Gaulle had predicted. The commission to investigate Kennedy’s murder was madeup of pliable senators and congressmen who were close to the CIA, FBI, andJohnson—and it was dominated by the two craftiest men in the hearing room,Dulles and McCloy. After months of investigative wheel spinning, the panel wouldreach its foregone conclusion. Lee Harvey Oswald had acted alone in the killingof the president. Case closed.When President Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana—one of the new African leaders who hadconsidered Kennedy a vital ally—was handed a copy of the Warren Report by U.S.ambassador William Mahoney, he opened it up, pointed at the name Allen Dulles inthe list of commissioners, and handed it back to Mahoney.“Whitewash,” Nkrumah said simply. It summed up the entire charade.The Warren Commission was named after Supreme Court chief justice Earl Warren,the distinguished jurist President Johnson strong-armed into chairing the JFKinquest. But as attorney Mark Lane—one of the first critics of the lone-gunmantheory—later observed, it should have been called the “Dulles Commission,”considering the spymaster’s dominant role in the investigation. In fact, Dulleswas Johnson’s first choice to chair the commission, but LBJ decided that heneeded Warren at the helm to deflect liberal criticism of the official inquiry.Although the chief justice was a former Republican governor of California and anEisenhower appointee to the bench, he had a sterling reputation among liberalsfor his court’s strong record on civil rights.“I don’t think Allen Dulles ever missed a meeting,” Warren remembered yearslater. Behind the scenes, Dulles was even more active than the commissionchairman. Warren was forced to juggle his commission duties with his ongoingresponsibilities on the high court. But Dulles was the only member of the panelwithout a day job. He was free to devote himself to commission work, and hepromptly began assembling his own informal staff, drawing on the services of hisformer CIA colleagues and his wide network of political and media contacts.The other two principal players in the inquest were Dulles’s longtime friend andfellow Cold War heavyweight, McCloy, and future president Gerald Ford, who wasthen an ambitious Republican congressman from Michigan with close ties to theFBI. While the rest of the commission—Congressman Hale Boggs of Louisiana andSenators Richard Russell of Georgia and John Sherman Cooper of Kentucky—shuttledback and forth between the Capitol building and the National Archives, where thepanel’s legal team had set up shop, the Dulles-McCloy-Ford triumvirate tookcontrol of the investigation.The three men demonstrated their dominance at the commission’s first executivesession, held on December 5, 1963, when they joined forces to block Warren’sstrong personal favorite for the chief counsel position, Warren Olney, alongtime political disciple of the chief justice. As an assistant attorneygeneral in the Eisenhower Justice Department, Olney had earned the wrath of theFBI’s Hoover for his aggressive prosecution of civil rights cases and wassuspected of being “hostile” to the bureau. Instead of Earl Warren’s man, thetrio installed their own veteran of the Eisenhower Justice Department—aRepublican Party stalwart named J. Lee Rankin. In 1958, Dulles had “heartily”recommended Rankin for membership in the Century Association, the exclusivemidtown Manhattan social club. As the Warren Commission’s lead counsel, Rankinworked closely with the Dulles trio to set the parameters of the investigation,keeping the focus tightly on Oswald and assiduously avoiding any areas thatcarried the faintest tinge of conspiracy.Dulles tried to establish the framework for the inquiry early on by handing theother commission members copies of a book titled The Assassins by Robert J.Donovan, a Washington journalist. Donovan’s history of presidential assassinsargued that these dramatic acts of violence were the work of solitary fanatics,not “organized attempts to shift political power from one group to another.” Itwas quickly pointed out to Dulles that John Wilkes Booth, who shot Lincoln aspart of a broader Confederate plot to decapitate the federal government, ratherfamously contradicted Donovan’s theory. But, undeterred, Dulles continued topush the commission to keep a tight frame on Oswald.Dulles was a whirlwind of activity, especially outside the hearing room, wherehe deftly maneuvered to keep the investigation on what he considered the propertrack. He showered Rankin with memos, passing along investigative tips andoffering guidance on commission strategy. There was no detail too small forDulles to bring to the chief counsel’s attention. “A great deal of thedescription of the motorcade and the shooting will be unclear unless we have astreet map and, if possible, a photo taken from the sixth floor window,” Dulleswrote Rankin in a July 1964 memo. “Is this possible?” Dulles was particularlyeager to explore any leads suggesting Oswald might be a Soviet spy—a soondiscredited idea that Angleton would nonetheless keep promoting for the rest ofhis life.Despite Dulles’s efforts to keep the commission away from any hints of adomestic conspiracy, from time to time uncomfortable questions along these linescropped up. During an executive session convened by the panel on December 16,1963, Warren raised an especially sensitive matter—the mysterious failure of thecountry’s security agencies to keep close watch on someone with Oswald’sbackground. How, for instance, did a defector simply stroll into the U.S.immigration office in New Orleans—as he did the previous summer—and obtain apassport to return to Russia? “That seems strange to me,” Warren remarked.Actually, passports were rather easy to obtain, Dulles observed. When thediscussion turned to the puzzling ease with which Oswald got permission toreturn to the United States with his Russian wife, Dulles offered that he wouldlike to get these aspects of the inquiry “into the hands of the CIA as soon aspossible to explain the Russian parts.”Senator Russell, long used to dealing with the intelligence community, reactedskeptically. “I think you’ve got more faith in them than I have. I think they’lldoctor anything they hand to us.”Russell was edging painfully close to the fundamental problem at the core of theWarren panel’s impossible mission. How could the board run a credible inquestwhen it had limited investigative capability of its own and was largelydependent on the FBI and the other security agencies for its evidence—agenciesthat were clearly implicated in the failure to protect the president?The Warren Commission was, in fact, so thoroughly infiltrated and guided by thesecurity services that there was no possibility of the panel pursuing anindependent course. Dulles was at the center of this subversion. During thecommission’s ten-month-long investigation, he acted as a double agent, huddlingregularly with his former CIA associates to discuss the panel’s internaloperations.Despite the chronic tensions between the CIA and FBI, Hoover proved a usefulpartner of the spy agency during the JFK inquiry. The FBI chief knew that hisorganization had its own secrets to hide related to the assassination, includingits contacts with Oswald. Furthermore, taking its cues from the CIA, the bureauhad dropped Oswald from its watch list just weeks before the assassination. Anangry Hoover would later mete out punishment for errors such as this, quietlydisciplining seventeen of his agents. But the FBI director was desperate toavoid public censure, and he fully supported the commission’s lone-gunman storyline. Angleton, who had a good back-channel relationship with the FBI, made surethat the two agencies stayed on the same page throughout the Warren inquest,meeting regularly with bureau contacts such as William Sullivan and Sam Papich.Angleton and his team also provided ongoing support and advice to Dulles. On aSaturday afternoon in March 1964, Ray Rocca—Angleton’s right-hand man ever sincetheir days together in Rome—met with Dulles at his home to mull over aparticularly dicey issue with which the commission was grappling. How could thepanel dispel persistent rumors that the CIA was somehow a “sponsor” of Oswald’sactions? The story had broken in the press the previous month, when MargueriteOswald declared that her son was a secret agent for the CIA who was “set up totake the blame” for the Kennedy assassination. Rankin had obligingly suggestedthat Dulles be given the job of clearing the CIA by reviewing all of therelevant agency documents that were provided to the commission. But even Dullesthought this smacked too much of an inside job. Instead, after conferring withRocca, Dulles proposed that he simply provide a statement to the commissionswearing—as Rocca put it in his report back to Dick Helms—“that as far as hecould remember he had never had any knowledge of Oswald at any time prior to thedate of the assassination.”But Senator Cooper thought the allegations that Oswald was some kind ofgovernment agent were too serious to simply be dispelled by written statements.During a Warren Commission executive session in April, he proposed that theheads of the CIA and FBI be put under oath and questioned by the panel. It was ahighly awkward suggestion, as Dulles pointed out. “I might have a little problemon that—having been [CIA] director until November 1961.” There was a simplesolution, however: put his successor, John McCone, on the witness stand. Thatwas fine with Dulles, because—as he knew—McCone remained an agency outsider,despite his title, and was not privy to its deepest secrets.When McCone appeared before the Warren Commission, he brought along Helms, hischief of clandestine operations. As McCone was well aware, Helms was the man whoknew where all the bodies were buried, and he deferred to his number two manmore than once during his testimony. Conveniently ignorant of the CIA’sinvolvement with Oswald, McCone was able to emphatically deny any agencyconnection to the accused assassin. “The agency never contacted him, interviewedhim, talked with him, or received or solicited any reports or information fromhim,” McCone assured the commission.It was trickier when Helms was asked the same questions. He knew about theextensive documentary record that Angleton’s department had amassed on Oswald.He was aware of how the agency had monitored the defector during his exploits inDallas, New Orleans, and Mexico City. David Phillips—a man whose career wasnurtured by Helms—had been spotted meeting with Oswald in Dallas. But when Helmswas sworn in, he simply lied. There was no evidence of agency contact withOswald, he testified. Had the agency provided the commission with all theinformation it had on Oswald, Rankin asked him. “We have—all,” Helms replied,though he knew the files that he had handed over were thoroughly purged.Helms was “the man who kept the secrets,” in the words of his biographer, ThomasPowers. Commission staff attorney Howard Willens politely called him “one of themost fluent and self-confident government officials I ever met.” Helms was thesort of man who could tell lies with consummate ease. It would eventually winhim a felony conviction, and he wore it like a badge of courage. When one wasdefending the nation, Helms would lecture the senators who pestered him late inhis career, one must be granted a certain latitude.It was David Slawson, a thirty-two-year-old attorney on leave from a Denvercorporate law firm, who was given the unenviable job of dealing with the CIA aspart of the Warren Commission’s conspiracy research team. Rankin had toldSlawson to rule out no one—“not even the CIA.” If he did discover evidence ofagency involvement, the young lawyer nervously joked, he would be found dead ofa premature heart attack. But Rocca, the veteran counterintelligence agentassigned to babysit the commission, made sure nothing turned up. “I came to likeand trust [Rocca],” said the young staff attorney, who found himself dazzled byhis first exposure to a spy world he had only seen in movies. “He was veryintelligent and tried in every way to be honest and helpful.” Slawson wasequally gullible when evaluating Dulles, whom he dismissed as old andfeeble—precisely the aging schoolmaster act that the spymaster liked to put overon people.Years later, as the Church Committee began to reveal the darker side of the CIA,Slawson came to suspect that Rocca had not been so “honest” with him after all.In a frank interview with The New York Times in February 1975, Slawson suggestedthat the CIA had withheld important information from the Warren Commission, andhe endorsed the growing campaign to reopen the Kennedy investigation. Slawsonwas the first Warren Commission attorney to publicly question whether the panelhad been misled by the CIA and FBI (he would later be joined by Rankinhimself)—and the news story caused a stir in Washington. Several days after thearticle ran, Slawson—who by then was teaching law at the University of SouthernCalifornia—got a disturbing phone call from James Angleton. After some initialpleasantries, the spook got around to business. He wanted Slawson to know thathe was friendly with the president of USC, and he wanted to make sure thatSlawson was going to “remain a friend” of the CIA.Far from shuffling through the Warren Commission proceedings, the septuagenarianDulles seemed to spring back to life for the inquiry. In fact, the entiredenouement to the Kennedy presidency gave new meaning to his career. While EarlWarren, who turned seventy-three during the investigation, seemed exhausted anddemoralized by the experience, Dulles was energized. When a friend congratulatedDulles on his seventy-first birthday in April 1964, he responded, “There havebeen many, too many, of them. At least I can say that I don’t feel any older,despite the passage of time; and with the work of the President’s Commission, Ifind myself busier than ever.”Dulles went about the grave business of probing Kennedy’s death with an oddlysprightly attitude. When it came time for the commission to examine JFK’sgore-soaked clothing, Dulles stunned his fellow investigators with aninappropriate quip. “By George,” he exclaimed, as he inspected Kennedy’s tie,which had been clipped off with surgical scissors by the Parkland doctors, “thepresident wore a clip-on tie.” By contrast, when Warren had to view Kennedy’sautopsy photos, he later remarked, “[They] were so horrible that I could notsleep well for nights.”His new job on the commission gave Dulles an opportunity to connect with oldfriends, such as Mary Bancroft and actor Douglas Fairbanks Jr.—who passed alongtips and bits of gossip related to the case—as well as British novelist RebeccaWest. In March, Dulles wrote West, beseeching her to draw on her fertileimagination to come up with possible motives for Oswald’s crime. The commissionwas so baffled by the question that Warren even suggested leaving that part ofthe report blank. “I wish sometime you would sit down and write me a line as towhy you think Lee Oswald did the dastardly deed,” Dulles wrote the novelist inMarch, as if discussing the plot of a whodunit. “All I can tell you is thatthere is not one iota of evidence that he had any personal vindictivenessagainst the man Kennedy.”Meanwhile, the following month, Mary relayed a news report about Mark Lane toDulles, informing her old lover in high dudgeon that Lane had apparently told aconference of lawyers in Budapest “that the killers—plural—of JFK were still atlarge . . . even I am amazed that Lane has the temerity to go to Budapest andshoot off his mouth in that fashion. I regard him as insane—but nevertheless Ido hope the FBI has its eye on him.”Dulles and McCloy, in fact, were very concerned about European public opinionregarding the Kennedy assassination, and they urged the commission to closelymonitor both Lane and Thomas G. Buchanan, a Paris-based American journalist whohad written the first JFK conspiracy book, Who Killed Kennedy?—an advance copyof which was airmailed to Dulles from the CIA station in London, where it waspublished. During an executive session in April, Dulles even proposed thatBuchanan be subpoenaed to appear before the commission.Earl Warren was obsessed with press coverage of the inquiry and agonized overpress leaks, including a May report by Anthony Lewis in The New YorkTimes—midway through the panel’s work—that the inquiry was set to “unequivocallyreject theories that the assassination was the work of some kind of conspiracy.”Warren was very upset by the premature news report, which suggested that thecommission had rushed to judgment before hearing all the evidence. The leak wasclearly intended to counter the publicity being generated by authors like Laneand Buchanan.While the commission frantically attempted to determine the source of suchleaks, the answer was sitting in their midst. The two most active leakers wereFord and Dulles. It was Ford who kept the FBI constantly informed, enablingHoover to feed the press with bureau-friendly stories about the inquest. AndDulles used the CIA’s own network of media assets to spin Warren Commissioncoverage.The New York Times was a favorite Dulles receptacle. In February, the Times hadrun another leaked story—also bylined by Lewis—that clearly led back to Dulles.Lewis reported that Robert Oswald, the accused assassin’s brother, had testifiedthat he suspected Lee was a Soviet agent. As the commission hunted the source ofthe leak, a staff attorney suggested that the Times reporter might haveoverheard a dinner table conversation that he and Dulles had with Robert Oswaldat a Washington restaurant—a highly unlikely scenario that nonetheless providedDulles with the fig leaf of a cover story.There was a smug coziness to the entire Warren investigation. It was a clubbyaffair. When Treasury secretary Dillon finally appeared before the commission inearly September—less than three weeks before its final report was delivered tothe president—he was warmly greeted by Dulles as “Doug.” Dillon was treated to akid-gloves examination by the commission, even though there were troublingquestions left unanswered about the Secret Service’s behavior in Dallas, whereKennedy’s protection had mysteriously melted away.Led by Willens, the commission staff had tried for months before Dillon’sappearance to obtain Secret Service records related to the assassination.Willens believed that “the Secret Service appeared to be neither alert norcareful in protecting the president.” This was a delicate way of characterizingwhat was a criminally negligent performance by the service entrusted with thepresident’s safety. The buildings surrounding Dealey Plaza and its shadowycorners were not swept and secured by the Secret Service in advance of Kennedy’smotorcade. There were no agents riding on the flanks of his limousine. And whensniper fire erupted, only one agent—Clint Hill—performed his duty by sprintingtoward the president’s vehicle and leaping onto the rear. It was an outrageousdisplay of professional incompetence, one that made Robert Kennedy immediatelysuspect that the presidential guard was involved in the plot against hisbrother.But Dillon stonewalled Willens’s efforts to pry loose Secret Service records,and when the commission staff persisted, the Treasury secretary huddled with hisold friend, Jack McCloy, and then appealed to President Johnson himself. “Dillonwas a very shrewd guy,” Willens marveled late in his life. “I still can’tbelieve he involved President Johnson in this.”Instead of being grilled by the commission about why he had withheld records andwhy his agency was missing in action in Dallas, Dillon was allowed to make acase for why his budget should be beefed up. If the Secret Service was givenmore money, staff, and authority, Senator Cooper helpfully asked, would it bepossible to offer the president better protection in the future? “Yes, I think[we] could,” Dillon replied brightly.If any blame was assigned in the death of the president during Dillon’s gentleinterrogation, it was placed on the victim himself. Soon after theassassination, Dillon and others began circulating the false story that Kennedypreferred his Secret Service guards to ride behind him in motorcades, instead ofon the side rails of his limousine, and that Kennedy had also requested theDallas police motorcycle squadron to hang back—so the crowds in Dallas couldenjoy an unobstructed view of the glamorous first couple. This clever piece ofdisinformation had the insidious effect of absolving the Secret Service andindicting Kennedy, implying that his vanity was his downfall. And with Dulles’shelp, Dillon was able to slip this spurious story into the commission record.When the Warren Commission delivered its 912-page report and twenty-six volumesof appendices to President Johnson in the White House on September 24, 1964, thetowering stack seemed designed to crush all dissenting opinions with its sheerweight. But the bulk of the Warren Report was filler. Only about 10 percent ofthe report dealt with the facts of the case. On Dulles’s insistence, most of itwas taken up with a biography of Oswald that, despite its exhaustive detail,managed to avoid any mention of his contacts with U.S. intelligence. The CIA, infact, was given a clean bill of health by the report, which reserved its modestcriticisms for other arms of government.Predictably, The New York Times and The Washington Post set the euphoric tone ofthe press coverage, with Robert Donovan—the same journalist whose book onassassinations had already proved so useful for Dulles—trumpeting the officialreport in the Post as a “masterpiece of its kind.” Newsweek national affairseditor, John Jay Iselin, sent Dulles a complimentary copy of the issue with theWarren Report on its cover, along with a fawning note. “Without exception, everyone of our editors who was involved in our too-hasty assimilation exercise foundhimself deeply impressed with the judiciousness and thoroughness of theCommission’s findings. I think we can all be proud of your labor.” Iselinthanked Dulles for helping to guide the magazine’s coverage of the report,telling him that the editorial staff’s efforts to absorb the massive report on atight deadline “was made easier through your kindness in giving us some idea ofwhat to be on the watch for.” Meanwhile, just as he had put Dulles in charge ofinvestigating himself, LBJ put Dillon in charge of implementing the WarrenReport’s recommendations.This pattern continued into the next decade when now president Ford appointedDillon to another panel that examined a possible CIA connection to the Kennedyassassination. The 1975 commission was chaired by a lifelong friend ofDillon—none other than Vice President Nelson Rockefeller. After pondering thematter, the Rockefeller Commission—which also included another old Kennedyantagonist and Dulles ally, retired general Lyman Lemnitzer—surprised no one byconcluding that any allegations of a CIA conspiracy in the JFK case were“far-fetched speculation.”Following the release of the Warren Report, there were still a few murmurs ofdoubt, including some within the commission itself. Senator Russell, whostrongly suspected that Oswald had been backed by others, seemed eager todistance himself from the report as soon as it was released. He fled home toGeorgia, refusing to make himself available to sign ceremonial copies of thereport or to autograph the official group photo of the commission.Some tendrils of suspicion even fluttered here and there in Dulles’s own socialcircle. Bill Bundy over in Foggy Bottom was among those who did not find theWarren Report completely convincing. “I think he accepted the Warren Report, butdid he believe it? That’s another matter,” recalled Bundy’s daughter, Carol,after his death. “I think he thought it was for the good of the country—this iswhat we put together and now we need to move forward.”Even those establishment personalities who were nagged by doubts about theofficial story convinced themselves that the national shame had to be laid torest. But the nightmare of Dallas kept afflicting the nation’s slumber. Itstelltale heart kept beating beneath the floorboards where it had been buried.And it would not leave Dulles alone."},{"pageContent":"21 [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-48]“I CAN’T LOOK AND WON’T LOOK” [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-48]In December 1965, a year after the Warren Commission wrapped up its business,Allen Dulles agreed to spend a few days on the Los Angeles campus of theUniversity of California, as a well-paid Regents Scholar lecturer. All he had todo, for what was described as “a princely sum,” was to give a few talks and rubelbows with students in casual settings. Dulles—looking forward to a relaxingwinter respite in the California sun—brought Clover with him.By this point, however, a wide network of Warren Report critics had begun toflourish—men and women from all walks of life, none of them famous (except forMark Lane, whose CIA-inspired bad press and bullish personality had rendered himnotorious). Among these critics of the official story were a poultry farmer,sign salesman, small-town newspaper editor, philosophy professor, legalsecretary, civil liberties lawyer, United Nations research analyst, and forensicpathologist. They spent untold hours poring over the most arcane details of theWarren Report, analyzing photos taken during the fateful moments in DealeyPlaza, and tracking down eyewitnesses. Their zeal for the truth would make themthe target of unrelenting media mockery, but they were doing the work that theAmerican press had shamefully failed to do—and in many cases, they went abouttheir unsung labors with great skill and discipline.Among this band of loosely connected independent researchers was atwenty-six-year-old UCLA graduate student in engineering and physics named DavidLifton. Lifton had not given the Kennedy investigation much thought—assuming,like most Americans, that the distinguished Warren Commission would get itright—until he happened to attend a Mark Lane lecture one evening in September1964, around the time the report was released. The grad student went to thelecture on a lark. “For similar reasons I might have listened to an eccentriclecturer that the earth was flat,” he later recalled. But as he took in Lane’slawyerly presentation that night at the Jan Hus Theater—inside a hulking, old,red-brick church on New York’s Upper East Side—Lifton found it so disturbingthat it changed his life forever. Soon afterward, he threw himself into theKennedy case with an engineer’s passion for detail and precision.Back in Los Angeles, Lifton plunked down $76 at a local bookstore to buy theentire, twenty-six-volume set of the Warren Report and spent a full yearmethodically working his way through its contents. He added another dimension tohis understanding of the case by reading the best of the conspiracy literaturethat was starting to emerge, primarily in left-wing publications like The Nationand Liberation, and in more obscure sources like The Minority of One, a cerebralmonthly published by a brilliant Auschwitz survivor named Menachem [M.S.] Arnonithat boasted such luminaries as Albert Schweitzer, Bertrand Russell, and LinusPauling on its editorial board. Lifton further honed his analysis of theassassination by intellectually sparring with Wesley Liebeler—one of the fewmembers of the Warren Commission legal staff to at least consider thepossibility that their report was flawed—whom he found teaching law at UCLA.By the time Allen Dulles arrived at UCLA, David Lifton was ready to do battle.Contacting the student who was acting as Dulles’s host, Lifton passed word thathe would like to sit down with the spymaster for a private fifteen-minuteinterview to discuss the Warren Report. Dulles refused to meet with Lifton alonebut did agree to answer his questions in public at a student chat sessionscheduled for that evening in a dormitory lounge. The student host warned Liftonnot to “badger” Dulles. Another Warren Report critic had tried to get the bestof Dulles the previous night, the host told Lifton, and the wily old spook hadmade “mincemeat” of him.That evening, when Lifton showed up at the Sierra Lounge in Hedrick Hall, he waswracked with anxiety. “I have never been more frightened in my life, inconnection with speaking to anyone,” he later wrote Vincent Salandria, aPhiladelphia lawyer who had established himself as one of the foremost criticsof the Warren Report. Dulles entered the lounge with Clover and the evening’smoderator. He lit up his trademark pipe and leaned back in his chair. Stillalert at seventy-two, Dulles scanned the group of forty or so students sittingin chairs arranged in semicircles in front of him, quickly picking out the youngman positioned front-row center who had obviously come to duel with him. Liftonhad brought along an arsenal of evidence, including two hefty volumes of theWarren Report, a file box filled with documents, and photo exhibits of DealeyPlaza, including copies of the “kill-shot” frames from the Zapruder film. Theengineering student had made a point of wearing his best suit, and his friendswho accompanied him for moral support were similarly attired. “It was obvious,”he told Salandria, “we were not beatniks of any kind.”After Dulles wittily deflected a question from a student about the CIA budget,the spymaster suddenly found himself confronted by the earnest, bespectacledstudent sitting directly in front of him. Lifton, not knowing how long he wouldbe given the floor, leaped right to the heart of the matter, directlychallenging the foundation of the Warren Report. “Mr. Dulles,” he began, “one ofthe most important conclusions of the Warren Commission goes something likethis: ‘There was no evidence of a conspiracy—’”“Wasn’t it, ‘We have found no evidence of conspiracy?’” interrupted Dulles.There was a twinkling charm to his manner, but he made clear that he wasprepared to counter Lifton every step of the way.Undeterred, Lifton plunged forward. Contrary to the commission’s conclusion, heasserted, there was ample evidence to suggest a conspiracy, not least of whichwas the Zapruder film, which graphically demonstrated that Kennedy’s head was“thrust violently back and to the left by [the fatal] shot.” Lifton knew his lawof physics, and the conclusion was unavoidable to him. “This must imply someonewas firing from the front.”Dulles would have none of it. He calmly informed the gathering that he had“examined the film a thousand times” and that what Lifton was saying was simplynot true.At this point Lifton walked over to the evening’s honored guest and beganshowing him grisly blowups from the Zapruder film. “I know these are not thebest reproductions,” said Lifton, but the images were clear enough. Nobody hadever directly confronted Dulles like this before, and the Old Man grew agitatedas he glanced at the photos that Lifton had thrust onto his lap.“Now what are you saying . . . just what are you saying?” Dulles sputtered.“I’m saying there must be someone up front firing at Kennedy,” Lifton responded.“Look,” Dulles said, in lecture mode, “there isn’t a single iota of evidenceindicating conspiracy. No one says anything like that. . . .”But now it was Lifton’s turn to school Dulles. Actually, the engineering studentinformed Dulles, of the 121 witnesses in Dealey Plaza, dozens of them reportedhearing or seeing evidence of gunfire from the grassy knoll. “People even sawand smelled smoke.”“Look, what are you talking about?” fumed the now visibly angry Dulles. “Who sawsmoke?”Lifton began giving the names of witnesses, citing the research done by HaroldFeldman, a freelance writer for scientific journals.“Just who is Harold Feldman?” Dulles scornfully demanded. Lifton informed himthat he frequently wrote for The Nation.This elicited an explosion of derision from Dulles. “The Nation! Ha, ha, ha, ha,ha.” If Dulles assumed the group of students would join in his mocking laughter,he quickly discovered that he was alone. “It is to the everlasting credit of thestudents,” Lifton later remarked, “that even if they did not understand the fullmeaning of the dialogue that was taking place, they did sense the obscenity ofthat laugh, that it was an attempt to intellectually smear, in disguise, and notone student laughed. Allen Dulles laughed all alone.”Dulles tried to retrieve the upper hand by making his antagonist look like anobsessive “time hog,” as Lifton put it. “Look,” the distinguished guest said tothe group, “I don’t know if you’re really all interested in this, and if you’renot, we’d just as well . . .” But the students emphatically assured him thatthey were very interested. “No, no,” they insisted, “keep going.”So with a shrug, Dulles was forced back into the ring. But having failed toknock out Lifton with his display of contempt, he seemed at a loss how tocontinue the battle. “I can’t see a blasted thing here,” the old spy angrilymuttered, taking another look at the hideous photos in his lap. “You can’t saythe head goes back. . . . I can’t see it going back . . . it does not go back .. . you can’t say that . . . you haven’t shown it.”But—after passing the photos around the room—Lifton had the final word. “Eachstudent can look and see for himself,” he told Dulles.After the heated exchange between Lifton and Dulles, the evening began to winddown. Dulles was given the opportunity to restore some of his dignity when astarstruck student asked a question that allowed him to discourse at length onCold War spycraft. Then Dulles bade good night to the students, and he andClover retired to their campus quarters. As Dulles withdrew, dozens of studentsgathered around Lifton, peppering him with questions about the assassination,and for the next two hours he gave a presentation based on the pile of evidencethat he had brought with him. “It was really a neat night,” he reported toSalandria. “I really felt tonight as if I’d won.”But talking about that evening nearly fifty years later, Lifton conveyed adarker feeling about his encounter with Dulles. He had the sense he was in thepresence of “evil” that night, recalled Lifton—who by then was a man in hisseventies, like Dulles at the time of their UCLA duel. “It was the way helooked, his eyes. He just emoted guile, and it was very, very scary.”David Lifton was the only person who ever gave Allen Dulles a taste of what itwould have been like for him to be put on the witness stand. No doubt Dulleswould have reacted the same way if he had ever been cross-examined. First, hewould have tried charm to disarm his prosecutor, then scorn, and finally aneruption of fury—perhaps accompanied by vague threats, as he did with Lifton,when he suggested that the grad student should submit to an FBI interrogation,if he had anything new to report.Dulles’s performance at UCLA offered a glimpse of how vulnerable the spymasterwas underneath all his bluster, and how quickly he might have cracked if he hadbeen subjected to a rigorous examination. But with the failure of Congress andthe legal system, as well as the media, to investigate the assassination moreclosely, it was up to freelance crusaders like Lifton to hold Dulles and hisaccomplices accountable.Dulles would be forced to spend the rest of his life grappling with the chargesleveled by these headstrong men and women, trying to discredit their books,sabotage their public appearances, and—in some cases—to destroy theirreputations. He had written Jerry Ford in February 1965, telling him he was“happy to note” that attacks on the Warren Report “have dwindled to a whimper.”But it was wishful thinking. The whimper of criticism was about to become aroar.Sometime in the winter of 1965–66, after Dulles’s showdown at UCLA, he suffereda mild stroke. But he soon rebounded and Clover despaired that she would everpersuade him to slow down. In February 1966, she wrote Mary Bancroft, asking heradvice for how to convince “Allen to take some care.” He insisted on keeping uphis busy social schedule, Clover complained, even when he wasn’t feeling well.“He quite often gets a chill and as I give him electric pads, hot water bottles,etc., he says he will be getting up in a minute. This morning he said he didn’tfeel well, he had done too much (two dinners in the same evening, one from 5:30to 7:30 where he spoke, the other purely social) and that he wouldn’t go out tolunch at the Club. But of course he went and the chill came next. I try to washmy hands of it all when I see I do no good, but when I think of how awful forhim and for everybody if his next stroke was worse, then I start once again,thinking of how to present the prospect of taking some care of himself.”The two women knew that Dulles would not scale back until his health failed him.He was “The Shark,” propelling himself relentlessly forward. If he slowed down,it would mean the end of him. He dined with old CIA friends like the Angletonsand hosted overseas guests like Dame Rebecca West and her husband, HenryAndrews, when they visited Washington. He hopped up to New York for meetings atthe Council on Foreign Relations with longtime associates like Bill Bundy andHamilton Armstrong. And in November 1966, he even sat for Heinz Warneke, aGerman-born sculptor best known for his depictions of animals, who produced abas-relief of Dulles for the lobby of CIA headquarters.That same year, Dulles published a rose-colored memoir of his World War II spydays, The Secret Surrender, and with the help of former CIA comrade TracyBarnes, he tried to turn the book into a Hollywood movie. But the project neverwent beyond the Tinseltown wheel-spinning stage, demonstrating that when it cameto dealing with the movie industry labyrinth, even espionage wizards weresometimes at a loss. Or perhaps trying to turn SS General Wolff into a screenhero proved too much even for Hollywood’s imagination.Much of Dulles’s time during his golden years was absorbed by the growingcontroversy surrounding the Warren Report. He knew that his legacy was tied tothe credibility of the investigation and he took the lead in defending thereport, while encouraging other commission pillars to also engage in thepropaganda battle. By 1966, Dulles and his commission colleagues foundthemselves besieged by skeptical reporters and filmmakers, as bestselling bookslike Mark Lane’s Rush to Judgment, Edward Jay Epstein’s Inquest, and HaroldWeisberg’s Whitewash ripped holes in the Warren Report, soon to be followed byJosiah Thompson’s Six Seconds in Dallas, which was excerpted in the deeplymiddle-American Saturday Evening Post. Thompson’s book would even land theHaverford philosophy professor-turned-private-eye an editorial consultancy withLuce’s Life magazine, which had earlier played a key role in the assassinationcover-up by buying the Zapruder film and locking it away in the company vault.Dulles was particularly disturbed by Inquest, a methodical dissection of thereport’s weaknesses that had begun as Epstein’s master’s thesis at Cornell. Totheir later regret, some commission staff members had cooperated with Epstein’sresearch, which gave the book more credibility than other attacks on the WarrenReport. In July 1966, Dick Goodwin lauded the book in The Washington Post andused his review to call for a reopening of the investigation—a bombshell thatmarked the first time a member of Kennedy’s inner circle had issued such a call.Alarmed by the steady erosion of support for the Warren Report, Dulles anxiouslyconferred with Lee Rankin and Arlen Specter, the future senator fromPennsylvania who had been one of the commission’s more ambitious youngattorneys, concocting the infamous “magic bullet” theory to reinforce thelone-gunman story line. As the groundswell for a new investigation grew, Dullesrealized that a major counteroffensive needed to be mounted. Once again, herallied his media allies, like U.S. News & World Report founder DavidLawrence—whom Dulles described to Rankin as “an old and close friend ofmine”—who published a ringing defense of the Warren Report by Specter inOctober.The propaganda campaign on behalf of the Warren Report was primarily run out ofthe CIA by Dulles stalwarts like Angleton and Ray Rocca. A 1967 CIA document,later released under the Freedom of Information Act, stated that growingcriticism of the report was “a matter of concern to the U.S. government,including our organization.” In response, the agency sought to provide friendlyjournalists with “material for countering and discrediting the claims of theconspiracy theorists.” One way that its media assets could impugn conspiracytheorists, the CIA suggested, was to portray them as Soviet dupes. “Communistsand other extremists always attempt to prove a political conspiracy behindviolence,” declared another agency document.As part of the campaign to smear Warren Report critics, Dulles compiled dirt onMark Lane, whom he considered a particularly “terrible nuisance” because of hisgrowing media visibility and his influence overseas, where he was often invitedto speak. Dulles received one report from an unidentified source that amountedto a sludge pile of salacious unsubstantiated rumors about Lane. “I have beentold that his wife was—even is—a member of the Communist Party and I have alsobeen told that Lane is not divorced from his wife as some people claim.” Adistrict attorney in Queens “has in his possession pictures,” the reportcontinued, “showing Lane engaged in ‘obscene acts’ with minors (girls—notboys—groups of girls). I have not seen these pictures personally but know thosewho have. Lane has the most unsavoury possible reputation.”Dulles’s informer also offered some crude observations about the lawyer’s race,ethnicity, and mental status. “He is supposedly Jewish—but there are those whoclaim he is half Negro or at least has Negro blood. He is very darkcomplexioned, wears horn-rimmed glasses and he’s always in a hurry. My ownpersonal opinion is that he is deranged.”According to Lane, the CIA went beyond spreading ugly gossip about him,subjecting him to relentless surveillance and harassment. As his public profilestarted to grow, the agency pressured TV and radio programs to cancel interviewswith him. When he traveled to foreign countries to speak about the Kennedyassassination, the agency sent bulletins to the U.S. embassies there announcingthat Lane’s local appearances had been canceled.Dulles assiduously avoided direct confrontations with his articulate nemesis. InAugust 1966, when he was asked to debate Lane by the producer of a TV publicaffairs program in New York City called The Open Mind, Dulles declined. Perhapsthe Old Man figured that if a UCLA student could rattle him in a casual campusforum, he would be seriously outmatched in a televised duel with an aggressivelegal warrior like Lane. Dulles also rejected an invitation to be interviewedfor a British documentary in which Lane was involved. The spymaster preferredmore nimble surrogates like the Warren Commission staff attorneys to do hisfighting for him.As time went by, even friends of Dulles began to air their doubts to him aboutthe Warren Report. His European friends grew particularly skeptical, but some ofhis intimates closer to home—including Mary Bancroft—also started challengingDulles’s explanation of the assassination. After feeding Dulles with tattletalereports about “the quite fiendish” Lane throughout the Warren Commissioninquiry, Bancroft—a weather vane of shifting opinion in her Upper East Sidecircle—started to consider whether the outspoken critic might be right afterall. “After listening to him, even I begin to wonder!” Mary wrote Dulles in July1964. By 1966, Dulles’s longtime confidante had gone over to the other side,much to his chagrin. That November, after Mary sent Clover a letter about thecommission’s many failings, Allen wrote back, telling her, “I imagine that wewill have to agree to disagree about the Warren Report. . . . I respect yourviews and I doubt whether I can have any great influence on them, but I may makea try when we next get together.”By 1967, polls showed that two-thirds of the American public did not accept theWarren Report’s conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone assassin. Thatsame year, against the backdrop of growing public skepticism, New Orleansdistrict attorney Jim Garrison launched the first (and what will likely be theonly) criminal investigation related to the Kennedy assassination. “At thebeginning of the investigation,” Garrison later wrote, “I had only a hunch thatthe federal intelligence community had somehow been involved in theassassination, but I did not know which branch or branches. As time passed andmore leads turned up, however, the evidence began pointing more and more to theCIA.”In February 1968, Garrison subpoenaed Dulles to testify before an Orleans Parishgrand jury—which undoubtedly came as a cold slap for a man long accustomed tobeing invited to speak before gatherings of the Brookings Institution, Princetonalumni association, Council on Foreign Relations, Carnegie Endowment, and otheraugust forums. As Garrison and his investigators examined the work of the WarrenCommission, they discovered that “leads pointing to the CIA had been covered upneatly by [the panel’s] point man for intelligence issues, former CIA directorAllen Dulles. Everything kept coming back to Cuba and the Bay of Pigs and theCIA.” The New Orleans district attorney wanted to question Dulles under oathabout the CIA’s connections to Oswald and to local figures in the Kennedy case,like David Ferrie and Guy Banister, whose paths had crisscrossed intriguinglywith that of the accused assassin.The Garrison investigation set off alarm bells in CIA headquarters. It soonbecame clear, however, that the authority of a crusading district attorney wasno match for the U.S. intelligence establishment. Days after Garrison sent offthe Dulles subpoena to the nation’s capital, he received a letter from theUnited States attorney in Washington, D.C., who tersely informed the DA that he“declined” to serve the subpoena on Dulles. Meanwhile, the CIA—which, by then,was led by Helms—mounted an aggressive counterattack on the district attorney.Subpoenas like the one sent to Dulles were simply ignored, government recordswere destroyed, Garrison’s office was infiltrated by spies, and agency assets inthe media worked to turn the DA into a crackpot in the public eye. Even theprivate investigator Garrison hired to sweep his office for electronic bugsturned out to be a CIA operative. After Dulles was subpoenaed by Garrison, thesecurity specialist—Gordon Novel—phoned the spymaster to slip him insideinformation about the DA’s strategy.In the end, Garrison’s powerful enemies managed to turn the tables on him, andthe New Orleans prosecutor himself became the target of an investigation, ontrumped-up federal corruption charges. “This is what happens to you,” heobserved years later, “when you do not go along with the new government’sratification of the coup.”Despite the public’s overwhelming rejection of the Warren Report, Dulles couldcount on the unwavering support of the Washington establishment and thecorporate media. An exchange of letters between CBS news director William Smalland Dulles in July 1967 summed up the media’s lockstep allegiance to theofficial story, no matter how many holes were punched in it by new research. “Ihope you had a chance to view the four-part series on the Warren Commission,”wrote Small, referring to his TV network’s massive apologia for the WarrenReport. “We are very proud of them and I hope you found them a proper display ofwhat television journalism can do.” Dulles commended Small for a job well done,although he noted that he had missed the third installment. After reviewingtranscripts of the entire series that Small had obligingly provided him, Dullesassured the CBS news executive, “If I have any nitpicking to pass on to you, Ishall do so as soon as I have read them.” The spymaster was always happy tooffer guidance to his media friends, down to the smallest details.Even the prominent group of men who had served President Kennedy were loath tobreak ranks with the establishment on the Warren Report. Dark talk of conspiracyhad begun circulating within the Kennedy ranks immediately after Dallas, butwith the exception of Dick Goodwin, no one dared to voice these suspicions inpublic.Arthur Schlesinger was cast adrift by Kennedy’s murder. The scholar had thrivedin Kennedy’s court, where his intellectual and political aspirationsintersected. Working in the Kennedy White House not only gave Schlesinger avoice in global affairs, it offered the decidedly unglamorous intellectual achance to rub elbows with everyone from French novelist and cultural ministerAndré Malraux to Hollywood siren Angie Dickinson. He gossiped over lunch withthe sultry actress about Frank Sinatra, who had been deeply wounded when he wasjettisoned from the Kennedy circle because of his association with the mob.Schlesinger was sipping midday cocktails with publishing queen Kay Graham andher Newsweek editors, who had flown him to New York to advise them on a magazinemakeover, when the devastating news from Dallas was announced.Schlesinger soon realized that he was odd man out in the anti-intellectualJohnson administration. More than a month after the assassination, Schlesingerconfided woefully in his journal, he still had not received “a singlecommunication from the [new] president—not a request to do anything, or aninvitation to a meeting, or an instruction, or a suggestion, not even thephotographs or swimming or cocktail invitations which have gone to other membersof the Kennedy staff.”The entire mood of the White House suddenly shifted under Schlesinger’s feet.“LBJ differs from JFK in a number of ways—most notably, perhaps, in his absenceof intellectual curiosity,” Schlesinger observed. “He has the senatorial habitof knowing only what is necessary to know for the moment and then forgetting itas soon as the moment has passed. . . . LBJ lacks the supreme FDR-JFK gift ofkeeping a great many things in his mind at the same time, remembering them all,and demanding always to know new things.” On January 27, 1964, two months intoJohnson’s presidency, Schlesinger submitted his resignation. “It was acceptedwith alacrity,” he drily noted.Schlesinger’s early resignation from the Johnson administration—which came sevenmonths before Bobby Kennedy’s own departure, to run for the Senate—solidifiedhis position of trust within the Kennedy enclave. The historian was therecipient of murmured confidences, from Bobby, Jackie, and members of theirentourage. Schlesinger heard disturbing reports about the events in Dallas. RFKtold him that he was wracked with suspicions about what had happened to hisbrother. Even CIA director McCone thought “there were two people involved in theshooting,” Kennedy confided to Schlesinger. Meanwhile, Air Force general GodfreyMcHugh, who had served as JFK’s military aide in Dallas, gave Schlesinger aharrowing account of “that ghastly afternoon” when they bumped into each otherat a French embassy party in June. McHugh had found LBJ huddled in the bathroomof his private quarters on Air Force One before the plane took off from Dallas.The panic-stricken Johnson was “convinced that there was a conspiracy and thathe would be the next to go.”Schlesinger took an interest in the first wave of Kennedy conspiracy articlesthat began appearing in the press, sending RFK a piece titled “Seeds of Doubt”from the December 21, 1963, issue of The New Republic. Nobody was more awarethan Schlesinger of the explosive tensions that had surged within the Kennedypresidency. “Certainly we did not control the Joint Chiefs of Staff,” thehistorian would acknowledge late in his life. And, as he knew from his futileefforts to reform the CIA, the Kennedy White House perhaps had even less controlover the spy agency. But despite Schlesinger’s inside knowledge of theWashington power struggle during the Kennedy years—and his ability to seethrough such shoddy work as the Warren Report—the historian did nothing toexplore the truth about Dallas.In the years after the assassination, Schlesinger secured his reputation as theofficial historian of Kennedy’s Camelot with his epic, Pulitzer Prize–winningbook on the abbreviated presidency, A Thousand Days. The 1965 bestseller—whichcarefully avoided the dark, unanswered questions about Kennedy’smurder—burnished the historian’s intellectual celebrity and opened new doors forhim on the cocktail party circuit. His bold-faced name popped up in New Yorkgossip columns, including a sighting at a raucous Norman Mailer party in January1967, highlighted by a trapeze apparatus that the more daring guests used to goflying through the air. “Any party with Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. and me in itcan’t be a failure,” chirped Monique van Vooren, a Belgian-born actress who wasonce the va-va-voom girl of the moment.Schlesinger was frequently invited to appear on talk shows, and that year hefound himself at a Los Angeles TV station where he was the guest of local newspersonality Stan Bohrman. After the show, Bohrman asked Schlesinger whether hewould be willing to meet backstage with Ray Marcus, a respected Warren Reportcritic. Marcus, who had concluded that the official report was “the mostmassively fraudulent document ever foisted on a free society,” thought it wasurgent that former Kennedy officials like Schlesinger examine his photographicevidence. He was certain that it would convince the New Frontiersmen that therehad been a conspiracy. But when Schlesinger set eyes on Marcus’s display—whichincluded the Zapruder film’s infamous Frame 313 kill shot—he visibly paled. “Ican’t look and won’t look,” Schlesinger said, turning his head and walkingbriskly away from Marcus. This was a perfect summation of the prevalent attitudeamong the Kennedy crowd. It was best not to linger on the horrors of Dallas.Despite the bad blood between Kennedy and the CIA, Schlesinger managed tomaintain affable relations with the spy set after Dallas. As he had throughouthis career, Schlesinger kept up a friendly, chatty correspondence with Dulles.In December 1964, Schlesinger even commiserated with the spymaster over HughTrevor-Roper’s “disgraceful piece” in the London Sunday Times, in which theeminent Oxford historian denounced the Warren Report as “suspect” and“slovenly.” After Dulles thanked him for the letter, Schlesinger wrote again inJanuary, informing Dulles that British political scientist (and dependable ColdWar pundit) Denis Brogan was working on a “detailed dissection of Trevor-Roper”for the CIA-funded Encounter magazine. “Perhaps if you are feeling up to it,”Schlesinger warmly signed off, “I could come by and see you one of theseafternoons.” Schlesinger’s courtship of Dulles in the midst of the Trevor-Ropercontroversy was oddly sycophantic, especially considering the fact thatSchlesinger himself shared some of the British historian’s doubts about theWarren Report.The cordial relationship between Schlesinger and Dulles suffered a bit of strainin the summer of 1965 when Life magazine ran an account of the Bay of Pigs thatwas excerpted from A Thousand Days. In his book, Schlesinger put the onus forthe disaster on the CIA, which—he accurately wrote—had maneuvered Kennedy intothe sand trap. Dulles found the Life article—along with a similar one that Lookmagazine excerpted from Ted Sorensen’s memoir, Kennedy—“deeply disturbing andhighly misleading.” The Schlesinger and Sorensen broadsides on the Bay of Pigsspurred Dulles into action, but after wrestling with a long, belabored—andunbecomingly bitter—response for Harper’s, he decided it was best to take thehigh road. President Kennedy had done the honorable thing and takenresponsibility for the fiasco, he told journalists calling for comment, and hewould leave it at that. By November, Dulles had resumed amiable relations withSchlesinger, sending him condolences on the death of his father.In October 1966, Schlesinger again rushed to Dulles’s defense when The SecretSurrender was harshly reviewed in The New York Review of Books by revisionisthistorian Gar Alperovitz, who suggested that the spymaster had helped kick offthe Cold War by going around Stalin’s back to cut a deal with Nazi commanders inItaly. “I was so irritated by the wild Alperovitz review that I sent [themagazine] a letter,” Schlesinger wrote Dulles. In his letter to the Review,Schlesinger ridiculed the attempt to blame the Cold War “on poor old AllenDulles. . . . Nothing the United States could have done in 1945 would havedispelled Stalin’s mistrust—short of the conversion of the United States into aStalinist despotism.” When it came to fighting the cultural Cold War,Schlesinger and Dulles were still brothers in arms.It was not until many years later, long after Dulles was dead, that Schlesingerbegan to question his cozy relations with the Georgetown CIA crowd. By then,some of the skeletons in the CIA closet had come rattling out the door, when itwas opened just a crack by post-Watergate congressional investigations. In 1978,seated at an awards banquet next to Jimmy Carter’s CIA director, AdmiralStansfield Turner—who was trying to at least straighten up thecloset—Schlesinger listened wide-eyed as Turner regaled him with CIA horrorstories. Many of the CIA director’s astonishing tales related to Jim Angleton,who—though deposed three years earlier—still cast a shadow over the agency.“Turner obviously regards Angleton as a madman and cannot understand a systemunder which he gained so much power,” Schlesinger later wrote in his journal.In September 1991, Schlesinger found himself at the Sun Valley estate of PamelaHarriman—Averell’s widow—with fellow guest Dick Helms, with whom he had beenfriends ever since their days together in the OSS. Schlesinger characterizedtheir relationship as a “rather wary friendship, since we both know that thereare matters on which we deeply disagree but about which, for the sake of ourfriendship, we do not speak.” Still, he had socialized regularly with Helms overthe years, sipping cocktails with him at the Wisners, swapping information withhim over lunch during the Kennedy years, and later, during the 1970s, playingtennis and enjoying barbecues in the backyard of Dick and Cynthia Helms’scomfortable home near Washington’s Battery Kemble Park. One evening,Schlesinger’s son Andrew accompanied him to a Helms barbecue. “I rememberfeeling kind of weird about [being there] . . . but my father thought he was themost honorable of the CIA people.”By 1991, however, Schlesinger had begun to question his assessment of Helms. Hehad recently read a series of articles about the CIA’s brainwashing experimentson Canadian medical patients, in which Helms had played a central role. “It is aterrible story of CIA recklessness and arrogance, compounded by an unwillingnessto assume responsibility that went to the point of destroying incriminatingdocuments,” Schlesinger wrote in his journal. “Helms was a central figure bothin recommending the experiments and in getting rid of the evidence.”Now Schlesinger found himself relaxing in Idaho’s alpine splendor with the manwho had been convicted of one felony—lying to Congress—and undeniably shouldhave been prosecuted for more. But the historian held his tongue. “In view of mylong truce with Dick Helms and my liking for him, I certainly did not bring upthe [CIA medical experiments]. But I did wonder a bit at one’s capacity tocontinue liking people who have been involved in wicked things. Bill Casey[Reagan’s CIA director and another old OSS comrade] is another example, thoughmy friendship with Helms is considerably closer; [Henry] Kissinger, I guess,still another. Is this deplorable weakness? Or commendable tolerance?”It’s a measure of Schlesinger’s decency that he could raise these painful,introspective questions. And it’s a sign of his weakness that he could neverbreak with these “wicked” men.In the 1990s, Schlesinger found himself dragged back into the Kennedyassassination swamp, with the release of Oliver Stone’s explosive 1991 movie,JFK, a fictional retelling of Garrison’s ill-fated investigation that proposedKennedy was the victim of reactionary forces in his own government. On Halloweenevening that year, Stone himself showed up at the door of Schlesinger’s New Yorkapartment. The filmmaker had ignited a media uproar (stoked, in part, by theCIA’s reliable press allies), and Stone—looking for support in the Kennedycamp—was reaching out for Schlesinger’s support. The historian found thedirector “a charming, earnest man, but, I surmise, scarred into paranoia by hisexperience [as a soldier] in Vietnam and dangerously susceptible to conspiracytheories.”In truth, Schlesinger had long been racked by his own doubts about the WarrenReport. His second wife, Alexandra, firmly believed that JFK was the victim of aconspiracy, but to her endless frustration, Schlesinger evaded the toughquestion by declaring himself an “agnostic” on the subject. As his son Andrewlater observed, the historian simply didn’t have the “emotional resources” toconfront the sordid facts surrounding the assassination.Near the end of his life, when Schlesinger was weakened by Parkinson’s diseaseand withering away, Andrew asked him if there was one book he never wrote butwished that he had. His father got “a little agitated,” recalled Andrew. “Hesaid he wished he’d written a book about the CIA. He felt the CIA was terriblycorrupting our democracy. He emotionally was saying [this]. He believed untilthe end that the CIA was undermining our democracy.”"},{"pageContent":"22 [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-50]END GAME [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-50]It was always difficult for Angelina Cabrera, the woman who managed SenatorRobert F. Kennedy’s New York office, to grab a few minutes of his time. As thefreshman senator from New York during the volcanic ’60s and the inheritor of hisbrother’s heavy legacy, Bobby was always in demand, always on the move, alwaysin the middle of the growing debate over the Vietnam War and the fight forsocial justice. Cabrera was respectful of the time that the senator needed tohimself behind his closed office door. And she was keenly aware of the shadowthat always seemed to loom over him. “He was sad most of the time,” she recalledyears later. “He was preoccupied most of the time about something—probably hisbrother. I had the thought that he would not make it. I was praying for him.”The grief that clung to Bobby did not make him a remote figure in his New Yorkoffice. He had a gentler aura after his brother’s death, and he created a senseof warm camaraderie among his staff. Aides felt they could challenge him, jokewith him, and he responded in kind, with his dry and lightly teasing sense ofhumor. “The senator dearly loved Angie Cabrera and [his New York staff],”remembered RFK aide Peter Edelman. “He loved them very dearly; he just enjoyedbeing around them. . . . It was kind of a one big happy family thing.”Cabrera would accompany Bobby to political rallies in Spanish Harlem andBedford-Stuyvesant, where Kennedy’s commitment to community development andempowerment made him an increasingly popular figure. Cabrera, whose parents hademigrated from Puerto Rico to Brooklyn Heights and who had worked as anexecutive secretary for the governor of Puerto Rico, helped connect RFK to hisHispanic constituents. In 1967, Bobby and Ethel invited her to fly with them tothe island, where he was scheduled to speak in the old Spanish colonial city ofSan Germán. Kennedy was stunned by the size and exuberance of the crowds thatgreeted him in Puerto Rico. Everywhere he went, people celebrated him as if hewere their best and brightest hope. He was the second coming of his brother.One day, that same year, while working in the New York office, Cabrera bargedthrough Bobby’s door with a timely item of business. She caught him as he wasfinishing what seemed like an intense phone call. “As I walked in, he thought Imight have heard,” Cabrera later recounted. “Actually I didn’t hear what he saidand I had no idea who he was talking to. But he thought that I did, and hetrusted me. After he hung up the phone, he turned to me and said, ‘There’ssomething more to this. I’ve got to pursue who really killed my brother.’”In the hours and days immediately following his brother’s assassination, Bobbyhad frenetically chased every lead he could think of, quickly concluding thatJFK was the victim of a plot that had spun out of the CIA’s anti-Castrooperation. But after this initial burst of clarity, Bobby soon sank into a fogof despair, unable to develop a clear plan of action. His depression came, ofcourse, from the devastating loss of his beloved brother—the northern star onwhom he had fixed his life’s course. But Bobby was also filled with despairbecause there was no clear way to respond to his brother’s murder. His mortalenemy Lyndon Johnson was in charge of the government and his own power asattorney general was dwindling so quickly that J. Edgar Hoover—another bitteropponent—no longer bothered responding to his phone calls. Meanwhile, Kennedyantagonists such as Hoover and Dulles were in control of the official murderinvestigation. If RFK tried to circumvent the system and take his suspicionsdirectly to the American people, he risked sparking an explosive civil crisis.The astute writer and political activist M. S. Arnoni, in fact, drew such achilling scenario in a December 1963 article he published in The Minority ofOne, a publication to which Kennedy’s Senate office subscribed: “To move againstsuch formidable conspirators might start a disastrous chain of events. It couldlead to American troops shooting at other American troops. It could lead to adirect take-over by a military clique. To avert such catastrophes, it might wellbe considered prudent to pretend utter ignorance, in the hope that theconspirators might be removed from power discreetly, at a later date, one byone.”And so, for the most part, Bobby Kennedy maintained a pained silence on thesubject of his brother’s assassination. In private, he dismissed the WarrenReport as a public relations exercise. But he knew that if he attacked thereport in public, it would set off a political uproar that he was in no positionto exploit. When the report was released in late September 1964, Bobby was onthe Senate campaign trail in New York. He tried to avoid commenting at length onthe report by canceling his campaign appearances that morning. He was obliged toissue a brief statement, giving the inquiry his perfunctory blessing, butadding, “I have not read the report, nor do I intend to.” It was an impossiblebalancing act that Bobby would strain to make work for the rest of his life.The CIA used Kennedy’s silence to bolster the Warren Report. “Note that RobertKennedy . . . would be the last man to overlook or conceal any conspiracy,” theCIA instructed friendly journalists in its 1967 memo on how to rebut critics ofthe report.But by 1967, emboldened by the growing campaign to reopen the JFK case and JimGarrison’s investigation, Bobby began to refocus on Dallas. Before, he haddeflected friends’ efforts to discuss their suspicions about the case, but nowhe tentatively began probing the agonizing wound. After seeing Garrison’s faceon a magazine cover at an airport newsstand, the senator turned to his pressaide, Frank Mankiewicz, and asked him to begin reading all of the assassinationliterature he could find—“so if it gets to a point where I can do somethingabout this, you can tell me what I need to know.” Meanwhile, Kennedy sent histrusted friend and longtime investigator, former FBI agent Walter Sheridan, toNew Orleans to size up Garrison’s operation. The buttoned-down ex-G-man took animmediate disliking to the flamboyant DA and reported back to Bobby thatGarrison was a fraud. Sheridan’s take on Garrison—which was reflected in theharsh NBC News special that Sheridan helped produce in June—foiled Garrison’sefforts to build an investigative alliance with RFK.The Garrison camp implored Kennedy to speak out about the conspiracy, arguingthat such a public stand might even protect his own life by putting theconspirators on notice. But RFK preferred to play such deeply crucial mattersclose to the chest. He would reopen the case on his own terms, Kennedy confidedto his closest aides—suggesting that day would come only if he won the executivepowers of the White House.“One of the things you learned when you were around Kennedy, you learned what itwas to be serious,” said RFK’s Senate aide, Adam Walinsky. “Serious people, whenfaced with something like that—you don’t speculate out loud about it. . . . Hehad an acute understanding of how difficult that kind of investigation is, evenif you had all the power of the presidency.”On March 16, 1968, Robert F. Kennedy announced his candidacy for the presidencyof the United States. He was motivated, he said, by his desire to “end thebloodshed in Vietnam and in our cities” and to “close the gaps that now existbetween black and white, between rich and poor, between young and old, in thiscountry.” Kennedy left unstated another reason for his White House run—tofinally close the case that still tormented his family and the nation.RFK launched his presidential campaign in the same chandeliered room in the OldSenate Office Building where his brother had declared his bid for the WhiteHouse eight years earlier. But a more somber mood hung over Bobby’sannouncement. Not only was the country—and RFK’s own party—more torn by war andracial divisions than in 1960, but there was an acute sense that his own lifemight be at stake. After Richard Nixon and several aides sat watching Kennedyannounce his presidential run on a hotel room television, the TV was turned off,and Nixon sat silently looking at the blank screen for a long time. Finally heshook his head and said, “Something bad is going to come of this.” He pointed atthe dark screen. “God knows where this is going to lead.” A few days after RFK’sannouncement, Jackie Kennedy—who had begged him not to run—fell into a bleakconversation with Schlesinger at a New York party. “Do you know what I thinkwill happen to Bobby?” she said. “The same thing that happened to Jack.”Robert Kennedy—the father of ten children, with an eleventh on the way—wasterribly aware of the risk he was taking. But, notwithstanding the youthfuleuphoria around Senator Eugene McCarthy’s “children’s crusade” for president,there was no political figure in America besides Bobby who had the ability towin the White House and heal the country. Kennedy spent many days—and long,anguished nights—wrestling with his decision. At one point, he sought the adviceof Walter Lippmann, one of the last of his breed of Washington wise men. “Well,if you believe that Johnson’s reelection would be a catastrophe for thecountry—and I entirely agree with you on this,” said the sage, “then, if thiscomes about, the question you must live with is whether you did everything youcould do to avert this catastrophe.”Kennedy’s mere entry into the race was enough to panic LBJ into abandoning hisreelection bid. But there still was Johnson’s surrogate—Vice President HubertHumphrey—to contend with, as well as the specter of Nixon, rising from theashes. Entering the campaign late, Kennedy threw himself into the primary racewith raw determination, knowing that he was fighting an uphill battle againstthe Democratic Party establishment as well as competing with McCarthy for theantiwar vote. Bobby waded, virtually unprotected, into frenzied crowds on everystop of his campaign; his presidential race was perhaps the bravest, and mostreckless, in American history. “Living every day is like Russian roulette,” hetold political reporter Jack Newfield. RFK was so moved by something Ralph WaldoEmerson had written that he copied it down and carried it with him: “Always dowhat you are afraid to do.”Bobby’s courage gave strength to those around him, to those ambitious,idealistic men who had served his brother and were now following RFK on hisperilous path. His heroism inspired their own. Men like Schlesinger, who couldnot bring himself to break from the establishment without a Kennedy leading theway; and Kenny O’Donnell, who had begun drinking himself to death, instead oftelling the world what he had seen that day in Dealey Plaza with his own eyes;and even Robert McNamara, who had allowed himself to be debased by hisallegiance to Johnson and the folly of his war. They now rallied around this newKennedy crusade, and they were better men for doing so. They joined the battlefor America’s soul, as if it were their own.JFK’s assassins knew that Robert Kennedy was the only man who could bring themto justice. They had sought to keep him close after Dallas, with Dullesshowering his condolences on the Kennedy family. “You have been much in mythoughts and Jackie, Ethel and you have my deep respect and admiration,” thespymaster wrote RFK in January 1964. He made sure that Bobby—as well as hisparents and siblings—received complete, bound sets of the Warren Report. He fellall over himself, with unctuous eagerness, to respond to queries from RFK,including Bobby’s request that he sit for an interview with the Kennedy Library.In his oral history for the library, Dulles further disgraced himself and thememory of John F. Kennedy by singing false praises of the slain president.But when Robert Kennedy announced his run for the presidency, he became a wildcard, an uncontrollable threat. The danger grew as Kennedy got closer to hisgoal of winning the Democratic nomination. The June 4 California primary wouldbe the make-or-break moment of his campaign. If he won the Golden State, thepundits declared, his momentum would be unstoppable.Oh, God, not again.” That was the collective moan that erupted from deep withinthe crowd at Los Angeles’s Ambassador Hotel on the night of Kennedy’s victory,as he lay mortally wounded on the grimy floor of the hotel pantry. As in Dallas,official reports immediately pinned sole responsibility for the shooting on atroubled loner, a twenty-four-year-old Palestinian immigrant named SirhanSirhan. The accused assassin was undeniably involved in the assault on Kennedyas the senator and his entourage made their way through the crowded, dimly lithotel pantry on the way to a press briefing room. But numerouseyewitnesses—including one of the men who subdued Sirhan—insisted that thealleged assassin could not have fired the shot that killed Kennedy. Sirhan wasseveral feet in front of Kennedy when he began firing with his revolver. But thefatal shot—which struck RFK at point-blank range behind the right ear,penetrating his brain—was fired from behind. Furthermore, evidence indicatedthat thirteen shots were fired in the pantry that night—five more than thenumber of bullets that Sirhan’s gun could hold. Dr. Thomas Noguchi, the LosAngeles coroner who conducted the autopsy on Kennedy, thought that all of theevidence pointed to a second gunman. “Thus I have never said that Sirhan Sirhankilled Robert Kennedy,” Noguchi would flatly state in his 1983 memoir.Then there was Sirhan himself. Like Oswald, he did not claim credit for theassassination. In fact, from the moment he was taken into custody, he seemedutterly perplexed by the tragedy in which he found himself playing the starringrole. The dazed Sirhan had no memory of attacking Kennedy. He struck manyobservers, including hypnosis experts who interviewed him, as a “Manchuriancandidate”—an individual highly susceptible to mind control programming.A security guard named Thane Eugene Cesar who guided Kennedy into the pantrylater fell under suspicion. He was seen pulling his gun as the chaos eruptedthat night in the cramped passageway. But investigators quickly cleared Cesar,and his gun was never tested. Over the years, Cesar’s possible role in theassassination of Robert Kennedy has been debated by researchers and lawyersassociated with the case. Some—like Sirhan’s current legal team—declare thatCesar, if not the actual assassin, played a role in the plot, perhaps helpingset up Kennedy as a target.Others, like investigative journalist Dan Moldea—author of a book on the RFKassassination—insist on the innocence of Cesar, who is still alive. “Gene Cesaris an innocent man who has been wrongly accused in the Robert Kennedy murdercase, and any claim to the contrary is simply not true,” Moldea e-mailed theauthor in 2015, adding that he now acts as the reclusive Cesar’s spokesman andhas his power of attorney.John Meier—a former executive in Howard Hughes’s Las Vegas organization—has tiedCesar to CIA contractor Bob Maheu, who was hired by Hughes to run his Vegasoperation in the 1960s. Meier claims he was introduced to Cesar in Las Vegasbefore the RFK assassination by Jack Hooper, Maheu’s security chief. Meier alsostated that after Kennedy’s murder, he was warned by Maheu and Hooper never tomention Cesar’s name or his connection to Maheu.But Maheu strongly denied the accusations. “Everything about [Meier] was a lie,”he snarled during an interview at his Las Vegas home before his death in 2008.“He was a 14-carat phony.” Cesar, too, has rejected Meier’s accusations, withMoldea—speaking on behalf of the former security guard—dismissing them as “justmore garbage being peddled by Meier.”Maheu pointed out that Meier was accused of evading taxes on money he allegedlyskimmed from Hughes mining deals and was convicted on a related charge offorgery. But it was Maheu himself who was the biggest crook in his Nevadaorganization, Hughes told the press after fleeing Las Vegas in 1970. Maheu was“a no-good, dishonest son of a bitch [who] stole me blind,” fumed the eccentricbillionaire. While running Hughes’s gambling casinos, Maheu had made sweetheartdeals with mobsters and allowed the CIA to pay off politicians with Hughes cashand to exploit Hughes’s corporate empire as a front for spy activities. WhileMaheu was being paid over $500,000 a year by Hughes as his Las Vegas overseer,he still treated the CIA like his top client.Maheu never concealed his hatred for the Kennedys. He even accused JFK ofhomicide during his testimony before the Church Committee, for withholding airsupport from the Bay of Pigs invaders. “As far as I’m concerned,” he said,“those volunteers who got off the boats that day were murdered.” But Maheudenied playing a role in the Kennedy assassinations.As with his brother’s death, the investigation into Robert Kennedy’s murderwould become clouded with murky agendas. There were hints of CIA involvement,Mafia corruption—and once again glaring displays of official negligence. SirhanSirhan’s prosecution was a streamlined process, with the defendant often seeminglike a confused bystander at his own trial. Just like the JFK inquest, theoutcome was never in doubt. Sirhan has spent the bulk of his life in prison,with his periodic requests for a retrial routinely denied.Allen Dulles, who turned seventy-five in April 1968, kept up a busy schedule allthat year, despite Clover and Mary’s concerns about his health. Dulles continuedattending meetings of the Council on Foreign Relations intelligence study groupand the Princeton Board of Trustees; there were luncheons at the Alibi Club,embassy parties and regular get-togethers with old CIA comrades like Angleton,Jim Hunt, and Howard Roman. And he continued to appear as a special guest onradio and TV shows.Not even the civil unrest in Washington ignited by the assassination of MartinLuther King Jr. that April seemed to faze Dulles. After King’s assassination,his followers took their fallen leader’s Poor People’s Campaign to the nation’scapital, erecting a protest encampment on the National Mall that they christenedResurrection City. On June 24—after more than one thousand police officers sweptinto the camp, dispersing the protesters—riots again broke out in the streets ofthe capital, prompting officials to call out the National Guard and declare acurfew. But Dulles did not let the disturbances affect his social life. “Lestyou worry at the news of a curfew in Washington,” Dulles wrote the following dayto Clover, who was visiting Allen Jr. and Joan in Switzerland at the time, “youcan rest assured that everything remains quiet here.” Dulles had invited theirold friend, Helen Magruder—the widow of OSS deputy director, Brigadier GeneralJohn Magruder—for dinner at Q Street. After supper, he wrote, “We were able toget a taxi shortly, and Helen returned home in safety.”That afternoon, Dulles continued, he planned to go to a CIA social gatheringwith Jim Hunt and his wife. “I am afraid I will have to pass up [family friend]Marion Glover’s afternoon affair, as I cannot get to both,” he told Clover.There was always too much for Dulles to do in his leisure years.That same month, Dulles found time to sit down and write a condolence letter tothe brother of another murdered Kennedy. “Dear Ted,” he wrote the last Kennedybrother, “I join with a multitude of others in expressing to you my deep sorrow.I had the opportunity of working with Bobby on many occasions and had greatrespect for his dynamic approach to our national problems and for his vigor andforthrightness in dealing with them. His death is a great loss to the countryand especially to those like yourself who were so close to him. I send you myprofound sympathy.” Once again, Dulles’s flawless civility is chilling tobehold.Ted Kennedy responded warmly to Dulles’s letter, in a way that the spymastermust have found reassuring. “Joan and I want you to know how grateful we are foryour message,” the senator wrote on his personal stationery. “At a time ofsadness, nothing is more helpful than hearing from a friend. . . . I hope wewill see each other soon.” It was clear that there would be no trouble from theyoungest Kennedy brother.On July 8, according to his day calendar, Dulles made time to meet with Dr.Stephen Chowe, an American University professor who was an expert in Chinese andRussian brainwashing techniques. Dulles had known Chowe, a former CIAresearcher, for some time. The mind control expert had reached out to Dulles inJune, arranging a time to discuss his latest work on “political psychology.”Then, on July 13, 1968—a few days after his meeting with Chowe—Dulles met withDr. Sidney Gottlieb, the CIA’s pharmaceutical wizard, who was involved in theagency’s assassination and MKULTRA mind control programs. These meetings on theDulles calendar are particularly intriguing, coming just weeks after theassassination of Robert Kennedy and the arrest of Sirhan Sirhan—a man whoappeared to be in a hypnotic or narcotic state when he was taken into custodyand, to some mind control experts, seemed to fit the mold of an MKULTRA subject.That summer, Dulles also continued to keep a close watch on Jim Garrison’sinvestigation. In July, Angleton deputy Ray Rocca phoned Dulles to discuss anarticle about the New Orleans prosecutor by Edward Jay Epstein in The NewYorker. In September, CIA mole Gordon Novel called Dulles to give him anotherinside report on the Garrison probe.The Old Man’s main social event of the fall season was the Washington fête inhonor of Reinhard Gehlen, the West German spy chief Dulles had resurrected fromthe poison ashes of the Third Reich. On September 12, Gehlen’s U.S. sponsorsthrew a luncheon for him, and that night there was a dinner for Hitler’s old spychief at the Maryland home of Heinz Herre—Gehlen’s former staff officer on theeastern front, who had become West Germany’s top intelligence liaison inWashington.That fall, Dulles eagerly anticipated the long-delayed presidential election ofRichard Nixon, the Dulles brothers’ former disciple. He got involved in theNixon campaign, joining fund-raising committees and contributing his own money.On Halloween, Nixon sent Dulles a telegram, thanking him for his support andappointing him vice chairman of the “Eisenhower Team” for the Nixon-Agnewticket. The Old Man had visions of returning to the center of officialWashington, perhaps with a prominent appointment in the new Nixonadministration.But Clover and others close to him knew the truth—he was slowly fading away. Attimes, in the midst of his frenetic schedule, Dulles would suddenly seem lost.“Uncle Allen would go off to lunch at the Metropolitan Club or Alibi Club andforget how to get home,” said his cousin, Eleanor Elliott. “Sometimes he wouldjust get lost in the neighborhood, and people who recognized him would bring himback. Clover was so worried.”In December—working with Howard Roman, his longtime collaborator—Dulles finishedediting a collection of espionage yarns, Great Spy Stories, featuring selectionsby masters of the genre such as Eric Ambler, Graham Greene, Ian Fleming, andJohn le Carré. In the book’s foreword, Dulles offered his final observations onthe stealthy profession to which he had dedicated himself. In the past, hewrote, “the spy was generally thought of as a rather sneaky and sociallyunacceptable figure.” But World War II and the Cold War, he observed, had turnedspies into dashing heroes. “The spy has the muscle and the daring to take theplace of the discarded hero of yore. He is the new-model musketeer.” None of theblood and sorrow that had flowed all around him had left a mark on Dulles. Hecontinued to have the highest esteem for himself and his “craft.” As he nearedthe end of his life, there was no self-reflection, only more tale spinning for apublic that could not get enough of the cool romance of 007.Soon after finishing the book, Dulles came down with a bad case of the flu,which confined him to bed. By Christmas Eve, the infection had settled in hischest and turned to pneumonia, and Dulles was admitted to Georgetown UniversityHospital. Over the following month, he struggled to recover, rallying at onepoint to write a congratulatory note to Nixon on his inauguration. But onJanuary 29, 1969, Dulles died of complications from his illness.Even after his death, the secret organism that Dulles had created continued topulse. A team led by Angleton swept into the Old Man’s home office, while Cloverlay in bed upstairs, and rifled through his files. CIA technicians installedsecure phone lines to handle the flood of condolence calls. An effusive eulogywas crafted for his memorial service at Georgetown Presbyterian Church. Thesoft-spoken church minister, who was used to writing his own funeral orations,balked at reading the bombastic address that had been written by longtime Dullesghostwriter Charles Murphy, with input from Angleton and Jim Hunt. But theDulles team quickly set the cleric straight. “This is a special occasion,” theminister was informed by an official-sounding caller the night before thefuneral. “The address has been written by the CIA.”The next day, the minister stood up in his church—whose pews were filled withthe solemn ranks of CIA spooks and political dignitaries—and recited the eulogyas instructed. “It is as a splendid watchman that many of us saw him,” hedeclared, “a famous and trusted figure in clear outline on the Americanramparts, seeing that the nation could not be surprised in its sleep or beovercome in the night.“It fell to Allen Dulles to perfect a new kind of protection,” continued thepreacher, not knowing how ironic the words he spoke were. “[F]or us, as for him,patriotism sets no bounds on . . . the defense of freedom and liberty.”Dulles’s funeral oration was a celebration of the lawless era that he hadinaugurated. Under Dulles, America’s intelligence system had become a dark andinvasive force—at home and abroad—violating citizens’ privacy, kidnapping,torturing, and killing at will. His legacy would be carried far into the futureby men and women who shared his philosophy about the boundless authority of thenational security system’s “splendid watchmen.” Dulles had personally shaped andinspired some of these watchmen, including Helms and Angleton—as well as thepower players of future administrations, like William Casey, President Reagan’sdefiantly lawbreaking CIA director, and Donald Rumsfeld, President George W.Bush’s smugly confident conqueror of desert sands. And though they never met,Dulles also provided a template for Bush regent Dick Cheney’s executiveabsolutism and extreme security measures in the name of national defense. Thesemen, too, firmly believed that “patriotism set no bounds” on their power.Today, other faceless security bureaucrats continue to carry on Dulles’swork—playing God with drone strikes from above and utilizing Orwelliansurveillance technology that Dulles could only have dreamed about—with littleunderstanding of the debt they owe to the founding father of modern Americanintelligence. Dead for nearly half a century, Dulles’s shadow still darkens theland.Those who enter the lobby of CIA headquarters are greeted by the stone likenessof Allen Welsh Dulles. “His Monument Is Around Us,” reads the inscriptionunderneath the bas-relief sculpture. The words sound like a curse on the men andwomen who work in the citadel of national security, and on all those they serve."},{"pageContent":"EPILOGUE [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-52]After Dulles, James Angleton soldiered on for several more years in the CIA’scounterintelligence department until his gloomy paranoia seemed to threaten thegleaming efficiency of a new espionage era and, in 1975, he was forced toretire. Angleton remained a loyal sentry of the Dulles legacy for many years. Hehad carried the master’s ashes in a wooden urn at Dulles’s funeral. Theirstories had been long entwined, from the days of the Nazi ratlines in Romethrough the assassinations of the 1960s. Dulles was Angleton’s revered monarch,and he was Dulles’s ghostly knight.When Angleton’s successors cracked open his legendary safes and vaults, outspilled the sordid secrets of a lifetime of service to Allen Dulles. Among thetrove of classified documents and exotic souvenirs were two Bushmen bows andsome arrows—which the CIA safecrackers wisely tested right away for poison,knowing Angleton’s reputation. The safecracking team was also horrified to findfiles relating to both Kennedy assassinations and stomach-turning photos takenof Robert Kennedy’s autopsy, which were promptly burned. These, too, weremementoes of Angleton’s years of faithful service to Dulles.But as he crept toward death in 1987, Angleton was less bound by the loyaltyoaths of the past, and he began to talk about his career with a surprisingly rawclarity. By then, his lungs were cancer-ridden from a lifetime of incessantsmoking, and his sunken cheeks and receding eyes gave him the look of a fallensaint. The Catholic Angleton had always needed to believe in the holiness of hismission. And now, as he faced the final judgment, he felt compelled to makeconfessions, of sorts, to visiting journalists, including Joseph Trento. What heconfessed was this. He had not been serving God, after all, when he followedAllen Dulles. He had been on a satanic quest.These were some of James Jesus Angleton’s dying words. He delivered them betweenfits of calamitous coughing—lung-scraping seizures that still failed to breakhim of his cigarette habit—and soothing sips of tea. “Fundamentally, thefounding fathers of U.S. intelligence were liars,” Angleton told Trento in anemotionless voice. “The better you lied and the more you betrayed, the morelikely you would be promoted. . . . Outside of their duplicity, the only thingthey had in common was a desire for absolute power. I did things that, inlooking back on my life, I regret. But I was part of it and loved being in it.”He invoked the names of the high eminences who had run the CIA in hisday—Dulles, Helms, Wisner. These men were “the grand masters,” he said. “If youwere in a room with them, you were in a room full of people that you had tobelieve would deservedly end up in hell.”Angleton took another slow sip from his steaming cup. “I guess I will see themthere soon.”"},{"pageContent":"NOTES [part0003_split_000.html#r_idParaDest-53]The pagination of this electronic edition does not match the edition from whichit was made.
