Or, in other words, this power, when exerted, is able to prevent public ation of facts inimical to Jewry, and is an adept at the pre sentation of counterfeit news on its behalf; so tha t the public is either no clearer in its mind on a given subject or is made a complete dupe. Treating Zionism on these lines brings a somewhat d ifferent aspect to bear on the subject, as the main object is to prove neither that the Arabs have a strong case nor that the Jews have a right to Palestine, but th at Jewry by its power can, firstly, dominate the British Govern ment, secondly, the British Press, and other means of publicity, and thus the mind of the mass. At the sa me time British Union will not shirk its responsibi lity towards the Jewish question as a whole, and will be prepared, when it comes to power, to nominate, in conjunction with other colonial powers, some area i n which the Jews will be able to establish themselv es and create a National Home. To give two examples of Zionist power, first, the n umber of letters, articles, etc., which have appear ed in the National Press extolling the Zionist cause, depreca ting the abilities of the Arabs, while on the behal f of the latter little has been produced in the same Press, and the writer has had personal experience of the b oycott which meets certain views, fully documented, which have been presented on behalf of the Arabs. There is thus seen clearly the dictatorial power to insert propaganda, and the power to restrain the a ppearance of facts which would injure this propaganda. For the second example, the Royal Commission's Repo rt, 1937, page 111, states: \"The inequality of oppo rtunity enjoyed by the Arabs and Jews respectively in putti ng their case before Your Majesty's Government, Parliament, and public opinion in this country, and the Arab belief that the Jews can always get their way by means denied to the Arabs. Based in general on the status of the Jewish Agency, both in Jerusalem and in London, this belief was greatly strengthened by the publication of Mr. MacDonald's letter to Dr. Weizm ann, in 1931 and by the debates in Parliament on the propos als for a Legislative Council last year.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Mr. Toynbee, in his \"Survey of International Affair s, 1932,\" page 302, writes of this letter, \"and in its replacement of the phraseology which had given offe nce to, the Jews by a phraseology which was courteo us and considerate in its tone towards them almost to the point of being ingratiating.\" A confirmation of this view is given in the \"Jewish Chronicle\" of May 6th, 1938 :- \"Professor Brodetsky sees Mr. Ormsby-Gore.\" \"Professor S. Brodetsky and Mr. Arthur Lourie, Poli tical Secretary of the Jewish Agency, saw Mr. Ormsb y- Gore and Sir John Shuckburgh on Tuesday, and discus sed various current problems connected with Palesti ne.\" Professor Brodetsky was asked to meet the writer in 1930 in order to convince him of the necessity for Zionism in Palestine. In reply to a direct question at the end of the conversation, as to Professor Brodetsky' s views with regard to the present inhabitants in Palestine, an unequivocal reply was given: \"The ultimate aim is t o push back every Arab from the borders of Palestine into Trans -Jordania.\" Thus, there was no question of co-opera tion with the Arabs, but of their extinction from Palest ine, which has been their home for 1,300 years or m ore. Yet to the British public Jewry proclaims its readiness to live at peace and on terms of good will with th e Arabs. WAR MEASURES, 1915-1918. Do not these examples at once demonstrate the undue and unholy Hebrew influence upon British Governments? Zionism has, over several centuries, e xercised a fascination for certain Jews, but it was not until the days of Herzl that the idea became an organised movement. In 1915, an agreement was made between t he British Government and the Sherif Hussein by which, in return for Arab participation in favour of the Allies, Great Britain recognised a future independent Arab Kingdom of territory then under Turkish suzerainty. Dr. Shiels, Under Secretary of State for the Colonies, 1929/31, refused in Parliament a request for the pu blication of the correspondence in connection with the negotiati ons which took place between Sherif Hussein and Sir Henry McMahon. (See Hansard, April 9th, 1930.) In 1916, the Sykes-Picot agreement was made which l imited the scope of the 1915 agreement, in order to recognise certain French claims. In the autumn of 1 917, the Allied cause, after a heavy expenditure in blood and money on a series of offensive battles, was in a parlous condition; during these months of battle, while British soldiers were perishing in their tens of th ousands, the Jews in Britain were holding\" a series of mass meetings on behalf of Zionism and, according to Mr. N. Bentwich, \"there was constant communication bet ween London, New York and Washington, either by telegrap h or by personal visit.\" Then, on November 2nd, 191 7, Balfour's letter to Lord Rothschild was published: ...\" We view with favour the establishment in Pales tine of a National Home for the Jewish people, and will use o ur best endeavours to facilitate this object, it be ing clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may pre judice the civil and religious rites of existing no n-Jewish communities in Palestine.\" Certain Jewish financiers, citizens of the British Empire, or loyal subjects to our ally, the United S tates, had made themselves into a state within each of two sta tes, and said in effect to the Allied Governments : \" Yes, we will help you, but we will make a bargain; Palestin e shall be allotted as an area for a Jewish Nationa l State, in return for which we will advance you certain millio ns.\" This is confirmed in the Royal Commission's Re port, 1937, page 23, in which Lloyd-George, Prime Ministe r in 1917, is quoted: \" that while the Zionist caus e had been widely supported in Britain and America before November 1917, the launching of the Balfour Declar ation at that time was due to propagandist reasons,\" and Lloyd-George has also stated: \" The Zionist leaders gave us a definite promise that, if the Allies committed them selves to giving facilities for the establishment o f a National Home for the Jews in Palestine, they would do their best to rally Jewish sentiment and support through out the world to the Allied cause. They kept their word.\" Thus, even as long ago as 1917 the Jewish power to exert pressure on a British Government is apparent, and by its money power, for what else could Jewish sentime nt and support mean, to bargain with the greatest E mpire in history. The Jews imposed their will on the British Government, and forced the latter to violate its p rior treaty of 1915 with the Sherif Hussein. These Jews being, they tell us, patriotic British and American citize ns."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Let us leave 1917, and come to 1930, and the days o f Ramsay MacDonald as Prime Minister. The Labour Government drew up a declaration of policy in Octob er 1930 as a result of the reports following up the disturbances of August, 1929. This White Paper arou sed the fury of the Zionists in London, and Doctor Weizmann, the leader of the Zionist organisation, r etired in anger, to address a letter of protest to the Prime Minister (see \"The Times,\" February 14th, 1931). On February 18th, 1931 the latter wrote a personal le tter to Weizmann explaining the position taken up by his Go vernment towards the Zionist question. As the resul t of this volte-face by MacDonald, Weizmann, and his Jew ish agency, agreed to co-operate again with His Majesty's Government. The whole force of British Jewry (with few exceptio ns) led by Lord Melchett and Dr. Weizmann declaimed against the British Government at Westminster, and accused it of treachery towards world Jewry. Britis h Jews can thus accuse British Governments of treachery wh en these latter do not interpret the Mandate and Ba lfour Declaration according to Zionist wishes. Once more, before this brazen onslaught British politicians y ielded. But with MacDonald, equally to blame were Baldwin, Austen Chamberlain, Amery, Lloyd-George, and Smuts, who likewise protested that the 1930 Declaration of Policy was \"a retreat from the Balfour Declaration .\" This Declaration of Balfour was in reality always o f doubtful value with its proviso, but Article 6 of the Mandate, approved by the League in July, 1922, pron ounced the limitations to which this Declaration mu st be bound, and, except under Jewish pressure, made the establishment of a National State an impossibility. Yet in spite of this article, in spite of Balfour d escribing his Declaration as \"an experiment,\" in sp ite of Leon Simon's doubt as to whether Balfour \" had in mind a Jewish State,\" in spite of all official reports ag ainst political Zionism, Jewry has been able to exert so much pressure upon British Governments that immigra tion of Eastern European Jews has not diminished, but incre ased, and political Zionism still rampant.

The name of Dr. Stephen S. Wise should be particula rly noticed as the man who has uttered threats agai nst the British Empire and who has claimed that Jews cannot be British, American, etc., Jews, and at the same time fulfil their loyalty to Jewry. Certain provisions of the constitution of this Agen cy are of doubtful legality, such as that land acqu ired shall be held as the inalienable property of the Jewish peop le, and only Jewish labour shall be employed on thi s land. According to Article IV of the Palestine Mandate, t he Jewish Agency was established to advise and co-o perate with the Administration in economic and social matt ers According to the White Paper of 1922 : \"It is neces sary to point out that the Zionist Executive has no t desired to possess, and does not possess, any share in the gen eral administration of the country. . . . That spec ial position relates to the measures affecting the Jewish popula tion, and contemplates that the organisation may as sist in the general development of the country, but does not en title it to share in any degfee in its Government.\" Paragraph 8 of 1930 White Paper reaffirms this principle. The se, then, are the aims of this Agency, and for whic h it should work, according to the League Mandate, and to the B ritish Government. Are these the aims of the Jewish Agency itself? The late Lord Melchett, in New York on the 2oth of October, 1928, referring to the Jewi sh Agency, about to be formed, said :- ...\" it is a great diplomatic machine which the Lea gue of Nations has entrusted to Jewry.\" Doctor Weiz mann, leader of this Agency, resigned his position as a r esult of the 1930 White Paper, because according to his interpretation of the Mandate the final aim was to make the Jews \" predominant \" (his own word) in Pal estine. Professor Brodetsky, another leading member of this Agency, stated to the writer in 1930 that the aim of the Zionists was to create a Jewish majority in Palesti ne, and ultimately to force the Arabs back into the desert in order to make room for this Jewish majority.10 Anot her leading member of this Agency has stated that Palestine must be made as Jewish as England is Engl ish or Canada Canadian. Mr. Ettinger, at the Zionis t Federation Conference in Sydney, May, 1929, said : ...\" The Zionist Representative with the League of Nations has an officially recognised standing. Through him we have a certain influence with the Mandates' Commission. Pro-Palestine Committees, composed of t he leading statesmen of each country have been form ed in France, Germany, Italy and South Africa.\" —\" Adv ent Herald \" (15/12/29). Is it not fair to ask here : \"Are the Jews working with loyalty towards the Mandatory Power?\" Let the Government Commissioners reply: Page 143 of the Sha w Report, 1930: ...\" that there exists among the Ar abs in Palestine, a strong feeling of resentment at the pr esent position in which, while they, a preponderati ng element in the population, have no means of direct access t o His Majesty's Government, the present Jewish Agen cy, through its head office in London, can, and is freq uently known to make representations to the Secreta ry of State for the Colonies, without first submitting th ese through the High Commissioner, again :- ...\" are, in our view, incontestable evidence that in the matter of immigration there has been a serio us departure"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"by the Jewish authorities from the doctrine accepte d by the Zionist Organisation in 1922, that immigra tion should be regulated by the economic capacity of Pal estine to absorb new arrivals.\" (Page 141, Shaw, 19 30.) Doctor Elder, once Chairman of the Zionist Executiv e, before the Court of Enquiry held after the Jaffa disturbances, May, 1921, said: ...\" There can be on ly one National Home in Palestine, and that a Jewis h one, and no equality in partnership between Jews and Ara bs, but a Jewish preponderance as soon as the numbe rs of that race are sufficiently increased.\" Referring to the General Federation of Jewish Labour, an offsho ot of the Jewish Agency, the Shaw report (pages 104 and 105) remarks : . . . \" it is the practice of that body t o have regard to the political creed of the several possib le immigrants rather than to their particular quali fications for admission to Palestine.\" In May, 1938, Malcolm MacDonald was appointed Secre tary of State for the Colonies. The Jews heralded t his appointment with glee; for as far back as 1930 he h ad declared his great sympathy with the Zionist Mov ement, and has been a member of the Palestine Mandate Comm ittee which seems to work—unofficially—to propagate the public mind in favour of Zionism. He has said : \" I have no doubt of the ultimate victory of Zioni sm.\" THE QUESTION OF CONCESSIONS. It is not surprising, perhaps, that when one turns to the question of concessions one finds equally st riking examples of Jewish power in the Central Government at home. Three outstanding examples are: (a) The Kabbara Concession; (b) The Rutenburg Concession; (c) The Dead Sea Concession. (a) The Palestine Government in 1920 alienated secr etly to the Palestine Jewish Colonisation Associati on an nrea of 3,000 hectares, at a nominal yearly rent, w hereon Arab families had been settled for 200 years . This land is situated on the Haifa-Egypt railway line, a nd possesses (b) Mr. Pinhas Rutenburg, a Russian Jew, received i n 1921 a concession for 70 years to harness the wat ers of the River Jordan, and all its affluents, for the pu rpose of generating electric power to be used for a ll economic purposes in Palestine, and in addition to this was granted the right to produce for sale electric powe r by any means other than water. At the time of grant the co ncessionnaire was not a Palestinian citizen. This concession was granted in September, 1921, no public tenders having been previously invited. In 1 920 an Arab of Bethlehem had asked for a concession to gen erate electricity from water-power but was refused, because the Government could not consider this appl ication before the ratification of the Mandate. The Mandate was only ratified in July, 1922. The value of this concession can be recognised at o nce when the importance of Government control of wa ter has been stressed by every expert called in to stud y the economic conditions of Palestine. Sir Herbert Samuel was High Commissioner between the years 1920 and 19 25. Rutenburg, in an interview with the \"Manchester Guardian,\" on the 26th June, 1922, said that he wou ld like to have Arabs on the governing body. There are none. The Palestine Electric Corporation, Ltd., was registered in Palestine in 1926. Extract from the report of this company for the year ending 3ist December, 193 3 : ...\" the profits were sufficient to meet the Pr eference dividend nearly FOUR TIMES, and on estimated profit s for 1934 this dividend covered OVER 6.5 TIMES.\" This Russian Jew was similarly successful in obtain ing a concession for the waters of the Auja River n ear Jaffa, again without public tender. But for once the Inter national Court of the Hague blocked his way, in rec ognising that the Turkish concession for the lighting of Jer usalem held by Mavromati was valid. The British Gov ernment received a strong rebuke for its methods of partial ity displayed in this case. (c) The Dead Sea. There is no space here to go into the details of the intrigues which took place befo re the final grant of this concession, and which even public deb ate in Parliament was unable to elicit a true reaso n for the final adjudication. Mr. Amery was in charge of the Colonial Office between the years 1924 and 1929, an d Mr. Ormsby Gore, now Lord Harlech, was for some conside rable time Under-Secretary of State for the Colonie s."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Mr. Novomesky, with whom, in conjunction with Major Tulloch, the agreement was made on the 1st of January, 1930, is a Russian Jew, born in Eastern Si beria, and has always been an ardent Zionist, and i n close touch with the Soviet Government. The concession wa s put to public tender, but the reasons for the cho ice of Mr. Novomesky have never been made public, and Parl iament was never given a really adequate opportunit y of discussing it. The possible value of Dead Sea salts may be £240,00 0,000,000. Potash is of vital necessity, during the War it reached £80 per ton. Today it is in the neighbourho od of £10, and a British group contracted to delive r potash from the Dead Sea at British seaports from £4 10s. 0d. per ton. The Colonial Office exerted considerab le pressure on Mr. Edwards, the late holder of the Tur kish Concession, and recognised as valid by Interna tional Jurists, to come to an agreement with Novomesky. Th e latter always demanded full control. In Parliamen t it was invariably stated that the financial syndicate behind Novomesky was British. It is interesting to note the list of the chief shareholders and directors. British na mes are remarkable for their absence or for their s mall holdings. Lord Templeton, in the House of Lords on the 20th March, 1929, asked :— \"Who is exerting pressure on His Majesty's Governme nt to prevent their action in this most important m atter according to the dictates of common justice and fai r dealing ? With the Rutenburg and Novomesky concessions in the ir hands, the Zionists, or world Jewry, control the economic future of Palestine, and the world control of potash. How much more correct would be \"The Tim es\" of June, 1932, saying to-day : ...\" that British po licy has been dangerously and incalculably influenc ed by political Zionism\" But \"The Times\" of to-day would not dare to publish such a statement, or to publish as it did at that date :- ...\" it is impossible to speak of t he impartiality of British administration in Palest ine in the face of the economic- monopoly accorded to Zionists in conc essions.\" The history of these concessions is the record of B ritish \" Democratic \" Government as the agent for J ewish finance. Further, one of the reasons for the £4,000 ,000 loan to Palestine was the £1,500,000 spent on the building of the new Haifa Harbour. The people of Pa lestine pay the interest on this loan. Certainly th e harbour is of great use for the development of Palestine, b ut it was also built to be of use to the British Na vy in the Eastern Mediterranean, and it is, therefore, a ques tion of whether the British Treasury should not its elf have paid a considerable sum towards the construction of this harbour. HISTORICAL ASPECTS. Proceeding now to the ability of Jewry to present s pecious arguments in support of false facts, it wil l be found that the means of propaganda controlled by Jewry ar e so wide as to ensure the success of these argumen ts There are several important points in the Zionist case wh ere this success is essential for the carrying out of their policy: (a) the historical claim to Palestine, (b) the territorial wording of the Sykes-Picot and Huss ein- MacMahon agreements, (c) the Balfour Declaration an d the Mandate, (d) the cry of persecution, universa l and local, (e) the claim that they alone can develop Pa lestine and bring prosperity to the Arab fellah. (a) The right of Jewry to claim Palestine has been built up upon a medley of imaginative facts, such a s the existence of Jewish monuments in Jerusalem and else where, the great autonomous kingdom of Jews in anci ent history established in Palestine, the cruel persecu tion suffered by the Jewish race. What are the facts? That the Jews emerged from a no madic existence, occupied Palestine after a defeat and massacre of the Canaanites and, after about 600 yea rs of ups and downs in the fight for existence with Philistines, Assyrians and Egyptians, were finally expelled by Titus in 71 A.D. In the words of a rece nt author :- ...\" they failed to effect unity, they were cont inually fighting among themselves, and they never, even at the greatest peak of prosperity, possessed Palestine as an autonomous self-governing country.\" As for the monuments, there remain a few blocks of the foundation stonework and nothing more. The wall s of Jerusalem were constructed entirely by the Arabs. A s for the persecution, one has only to read their o wn prophets to understand their misfortunes through th e ages, brought upon them by their \" stiff-necked \" attitude. This is confirmed by the historical sketch at the o pening of the Royal Commission's Report, 1937, unde r \" the Jews in Palestine,\" page 2."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"(b) According to the MacMahon-Hussein Agreement the geographical frontiers of the Arab Kingdom were to be bounded \" in the west by the Red Sea, and the Me diterranean up to Mersina.\" In the final agreement, October, 1915, the following area was excluded: \"th e districts of Mersina and Alexandria and portions of Syria, lying to the west of the district of Damascus, Homs , Hama, and Aleppo.\" The Zionists, trading on the geographical vagueness of the general public, attempt to include Palestin e in the latter area as West of Damascus, whereas it is only about twenty degrees west of due south. So, firstl y ignoring the agreement with the Sherif Hussein, and secondly , falsely interpreting a geographical term \" West,\" they make the public believe that the Zionist claim is j ust. (c) As for the words \" National Home \" in the Balfo ur Declaration, these have been argued as signifyin g a Jewish State, and the Declaration as a promise whic h must be executed. Neither assumption is correct, first, because a Jewish State would mean political dominat ion of \" the existing communities,\" and secondly, b ecause Balfour explicitly qualified his Declaration by cal ling it \" an experiment.\" These facts are, of cours e, never mentioned by Zionists and their Gentile supporters, seldom do these same people quote the latter half of Article 2 of the Mandate. The British public is made to hea r a great deal of \" to place the country under such economic conditions as will secure the establishment of a \" Jewish National Home,\" but little of \" to safeguard the civil . . . rights \" of the other communities. (d) The August disturbance in 1929 over the \"Wailin g Wall\" dispute was an exceptionally good example o f Jewish propaganda, and the arousing of world sympat hy for persecuted Jewry. What are the facts? The Zi onists spoke of the Wall as their property, although early in 1929, before a Court of Inquiry, they were unab le to produce any documentary evidence, and Rabbi Koch ev en said that documentary evidence would weaken thei r undoubted rights. The Arabs produced documentary ev idence dating from the Turkish regime, and which wa s accepted by the Shaw Commission, giving them undisp uted possession of this Wall. Yet, because the Brit ish Government accepted this Arab right and the status quo for worship, world Jewry started an agitation a gainst the British Government, and demanded the restoratio n of the Wall. Here is the supreme specious argumen t:— ...\"If we demand 'restoration' the public will be l ed to believe that we once possessed this Wall, and we own the rights, the Arabs will be the villains!\" Was not th is supposition correct? On the I2th September, 1929 , the Arab Executive Committee sent a long telegram to London, which began :- \" Zionists have, through vast means of propaganda i n Europe and America, undeservedly polluted Arab na me, and hold them responsible for present disturbances. \" The Government's report, published in March, 1930 , vindicated the Arabs, but how many of the public re ad this ? The harm had been done. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS. \"The myth of Arab prosperity.\" Here the Jewish propagandists, at meetings, public and private, and in the Press, proclaim : (a) that the Arab is too backward to produce the best result from the so il available for cultivation, and the Jewish urban immigrant will be able to teach him \" progress \" ! (b) that, as a whole, the Arab fellah in particular and the A rabs in general have profited by the arrival of the eastern European ghetto populations. Again the facts are hidden with a veneer of truth. Sir John Hope-Simpson reported: ...\"that the Arab f ellah is neither lazy nor unintelligent. He is a competent a nd capable agriculturalist, and there is little dou bt that were he to be given the chance of learning better method s, and the capital which is a necessary preliminary to their employment, he would rapidly improve his position.\" On the other hand the Zionist colonies are neavily subsidised, and for many years have been unable to payback either interest or capital. Again, the Arab, by his past indebtedness and by inflated prices of land, has been forced to sell his best soil. How can the Jewish immigrant make a good farmer, co ming, as he does, generally from Eastern European ghettos? Until the recent German immigration the pe rcentage of these immigrants was over 70%. What has really happened? In 1919 there were 13,000 Jews out of 56,000 settled on the land in Palestine.

Imports £17,853,000; Exports £4,215,000. Yet the Jewish Age ncy shrieks prosperity at the High Commissioner and Colonial Office, and demands ever more immigrants. The Agency bases its prosperity claim on the revenu e, which more than doubled between 1931 and 1935, due to the expansion in custom receipts, and on 1st Oct ober, 1936, the Government held a surplus of £6,200,000.

Extracts from the \"Palestine and Transjordan,\" 21st May, 1938: \" To every person in the foreign world who happens to be impressed with the Jewish propagandis ts' claim that Jewish immigration into Palestine ha s brought blessings and prosperity with it, we publis h the following items of news for their enlightenme nt:- \" For five consecutive days, between May 12th and M ay 16th, a party of about 3,000 unemployed Jewish labourers occupied the Municipality building of Tel -Aviv and asked for bread and employment. They threatened, and actually executed their threat, tha t they would not leave the place unless they were g iven assurances that the Municipality would immediately inaugurate new construction programmes and give the m employment. The Municipal Council first hesitated t o accede to their demand; and the Mayor's argument was that more than L.P.2,000,000 have been spent so far on unnecessary schemes by the Municipality and tha t the latter is in no position now to start further usele ss relief projects. Finally, at the conclusion of t he fifth day, the Mayor was forced to promise the demonstrators that public works providing employment for between 800 a nd 900 persons would be undertaken within the next few weeks, and that grants of L.P.500 a month shall be made to the Unemployed Assistance Fund in May and June.\" . . . \"Conscious of their colleagues' success, a party of 300 unemployed Jewish labourers entered the office s of the Hedera Local Council on the 16th instant, and deman ded immediate work for the unemployed.\" . . .

This, after ten years of shrieking publicity about the Jewish Eldo rado in Palestine ! THE CITRUS TRADE. This accounts for 75% of Palestine's exports. The t otal output for 1937-38 was 13.5 million cases, of which 11.5 million were exported. Oranges make up about 8 5% and grape fruit 15% of growth. The Arab proporti on of this trade is 50%—55%. The average wage for Arab labour in the citrus industry in September, 1937, was 100-180 mils per day, and for Jewish Labour 200-300 mils per day. It would seem, therefore, that the \"prosperity\" of Palestine depends on the finding of markets for an ever- greater development of the citrus trade and in the continual flow of imported capital. At any rate, th e rural areas, which account for 60% of the total populatio n and, of course, nearly 80% of the Arabs have not felt this prosperity. (Information Dept., Papers No. 20, Inst itute of International Affairs, page 75): \"The pros perity of the country was not reflected in the rural population.\" \" In 1935, circumstances took a definite turn for the better, but in 1936 agricultural taxes were again remitted in Southern Palestine.\" This same paper remarks on page 76, \"one thing which prevents the Arabs from appreciati ng the advantages derived from the country's greate r prosperity is Zionist exclusiveness, both economic and cultural. Nor can prosperity alone be expected to appeal to Arabs as a final argument in favour of Jewish im migration.\" THE ARAB FELLAH. The Jewish leaders cry out that the Arab antagonism against Zionism is artificially inspired by the \"e ffendi \" and foreign propaganda, and that the fellah on the other hand is not hostile and has profited from the importation of Jewish capital. Some further facts o n this point will not be out of place. Sir John Hop e Simpson has said in his report of 1930 that 30% of the Fell aheen have become landless and that the Fellah Fami ly needed a lot viable of 130 dunums and he had at tha t time only 90. So much land has been sold since th at report which has, therefore, made more landless Arabs who have migrated to the towns. In 1935 in Haifa alone, 11,160 Arab workers were li ving in 2,473 petrol-tin huts. Early in 1938 there were 21,000 Arabs unemployed in seven selected towns and 12,000 Jews out of work. Yet 1,000 labour immigran t certificates were issued for the months, April to S eptember, and to this number, under pressure, a fur ther 150 were added. The Palestine administration has itself admitted th at Arab educational services had hardly kept pace w ith the expansion of the school age population. The Royal C ommission (1937) reports : \" It is most regrettable that after seventeen years of mandatory rule, the Govern ment system is able to satisfy no more than half th e Arab demand for education . . . this is more deplorable in that many Arab villages are willing, if only the Government will do its share, to contribute towards the erecti on of school buildings.\" Under Jewish Agency pressure, which was able to voi ce protests in the British Press and Parliament, Ha uran labour which had been imported from Syria because i t was cheaper, was displaced by Jewish labour in th e port of Haifa in 1937. Arab labour benefited to the exte nt of 200 for which 1,200 applicants arrived. In the question of Health Services the fellah has r eceived no benefits from Jewish money. Mr. G. Mansu r, a working baker and a schoolmaster by profession, has compiled evidence in his \" Arab Worker under the Palestine Mandate,\" which blows sky-high the preten tions of Zionists and their claim to have benefited the fellah. The Government's report for Palestine, 1937 (issued June, 1938), states on pages 30-31 certain signifi cant facts: \"Expenditure on defence £697,000 out of a budget of about £6 millions. On December 31st 1937, the curr ency in circulation was £4,829,134 compared to £5,741,13 4 the previous year. Customs receipts had fallen fr om an average of £240,200 per month to £177,000. Receivin g orders were issued for 57 companies as compared w ith six in 1936, and the number of declared bankruptcie s was 57 to 33 in 1936. Assets about £40 million, l iabilities over £104 million.\""},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"1936-1938 Strikes - Rebellion - Commissions - Partition? According to the Jewish propaganda Arab strikers an d \"terrorists \" were driven into these uncongenial occupations by the evil machinations of the Mufti H aj Amin el-Husseini and by the advent of foreign mo ney (Italian?). The truth, as usual, was widely separated from the Jewish account. As a result of a united Arab appeal for the establishment of democratic government, of prohibit ion of transfer of land to Jews, of cessation of Je wish immigration, the British Government on February ist , 1937, reasserted its offer of December, 1935, for a new constitution and the establishment of a Legislative Council. Jews, according to the Information Depart ment, Paper No. 20 of the Institute of International Affa irs, \"were unanimous in condemning the proposed constitution and the Government's reply to the Arab s. An influential delegation protested in London, a nd the Jewish Agency issued a memorandum on the subject.\" This Jewish pressure, exerted both in the House of Lords and in the Commons, as well as at Geneva in t he Mandates Commission's meeting of June, 1936, gave t he Arabs \"fresh evidence of Jewish influence in London.\" In consequence, the disorders in Palestine , which have continued to this day, with the except ion of the Royal Commission's stay in Palestine, broke out on April 26th, 1936. The Royal Commission came, and we nt, issued a report in which the findings were again pa rticularly favourable to the Arabs and a demolition of many Jewish arguments; but fearful of offending Jewry wi th a definite statement that Zionism was a failure, the most pitiable of all solutions was suggested, that of Pa rtition, an act of historical ill-omen and cursed b y all parties, Arab and Jew. Between December 1st, 1937, and March 31st, 1938, a bout 30,000 troops have been occupying Palestine. T here have been 381 people killed and wounded,24 and anot her Commission, this time one on the technical poin ts of Partition, sent to Palestine. And yet, the Jews cry that the British Government has not even attempted to fulfil the Balfour Declaration. Both the dictatorship and aggressive tendencies of Jewry are exemplified to t he full in this question of Palestine. Alone, the subjugation, or worse, the extermination, of the Arabs, will sa tisfy the Jews. In Europe they cry persecution, in the Middle East they practice persecution. On occasion after occasion we read of the Jewish Agency, the Board of Deputies for British Jews, visiting the Colonial Office to protest against the establishment of the Legislative Counci l in Palestine or the pro-Arab policy of the Britis h Government; the pressure never relaxes. Brodetsky t ells the British public through the medium of the D aily Herald: ...\" that Jews throughout the world are una nimous in their opposition to the Council, it would frustrate the purpose of the Mandate, the Jews being in the m inority.\" Not a word about the self-Government clauses in the Mandates, not a word about the civil rights of the existing communities, not a word about \" Democracy \" ! The power of Jewish propaganda has been fully exemp lified, both over the Government and in the Press. The newspapers particularly sensible to-day to the Jewi sh claims are The Times, Daily Herald, News Chronic le, Manchester Guardian, and Daily Telegraph. The power of Jewry to restrain news hostile to Zionism has n ot been so clearly manifested. Here are some examples of Jewish opinion which are unknown to the British public: (1) Ochs, the late owner of the New York Times, was never a supporter of political Zionism, believing that this was not a solution of the Jewish problem. (2) Doctor Magnus, the Chancellor of the Hebrew Uni versity at Jerusalem, stated in his address to the students in 1930:— ...\" If Zionism rests for support upon British bayo nets our movement is bankrupt from the start.\" (3) Sir Victor Harari, head of a leading Jewish fam ily in Cairo, Egypt, was responsible for certain ne gotiations between the Arab leaders and the British Government during 1918-19. He resigned his position as an off icial leader of the Zionist movement because, as he state d to the writer, personally, the Jews in high place s had not kept the promises they had made to the Arabs of Pal estine and to King Feisal. These Jews had brought p ressure to bear on the British politicians whereby Arabs' r ights originally safeguarded were not only jeopardi sed, but disregarded. Such facts never appear in our Nationa l Press. There have been eight Commissions in Pales tine, and a ninth is at work, and six British statements of policy. But what has been done, what action take n? Nothing constructive, only the use of force for the imposit ion of a policy which is bound to terminate in disa ster."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"As for the Partition suggested by the Peel Commissi on, no solution could be less likely to bring a per manent easing of this problem. For not only were 250,000 A rabs to be incorporated in the Jewish State, but la ter they were to be transferred from the land on which they have lived for 1,300 years. Further the Arab State was to receive a subsidy from the Jewish State and, of cou rse, the Jews were to have the rich areas while the Arabs were to be fenced in upon the stony hillsides of Pa lestine. It is thus on the evidence not out of place to sugg est that political Zionism is inspired by no sense of the ideal, but it is essentially materialistic and based upon the desire of Jewish financiers to control what the more far- seeing bankers among them recognised would become a very important link in the Imperial chain of communications. To achieve this they employ the poo r Jew to do the rough work and to face the risk of death by riot, while they sit in the comfortable offices of London, New York and Paris. To support this cont ention let us terminate this brief review of Zionism with a fe w quotations from leading members of world Jewry, a nd a few Gentile sympathisers. EMPIRE STRATEGY The latter believe that half a million Eastern Euro pean Jews, polluted with Communistic doctrines, all ied to every European Bolshevist leader, planted in Palest ine, astride our Empire communications are a greate r safeguard than a unified, contented Arab Kingdom. T he world is certainly awry, and reason is at a disc ount in Great Britain. The Arabs, and the Muslims in India, our most staunch sup-porters, are the followers of Islam. There are nearly 250,000,000 Muslims in the world, and 16,000,000 Jews. To establish an Arab kingdom i n close alliance with the British Empire must be sure ly rather the aim of British foreign policy than th at of facilitating a Jewish-Communistic and Jew-financed controlled state astride our Empire's oriental communications, composed of Jews who are generally the riff-raff of Central Europe (nearly 70% of immigrants). The supposition that a Jewish State in Palestine will strengthen the Empire would be ludi crous were it not so pregnant with tragedy for the Britis h Empire. Colonel Wedgewood: \"A great deal of the f uture of the British Empire depends upon our having in that corner of the Medi terranean a friendly people, dep ending upon us and, therefore, reliable. It is of the utmost importance to the future of the British Empire that we should have the co-operatio n of the Jews in the further extension of our Empire.\" The l ate Lord Melchett, October 26th, 1928. \"Palestine has always been a highway of the world, it is the Belgium of the East.\" Herd (from Bentwich in \"Palestine,\" page 69). ...\" Herzl sought later to get in touch with Lord S alisbury, the English Prime Minister, arguing that an autonomous Jewish community in Palestine under the suzerainty of the Sultan would be a valuable link i n the Imperial chain.\" Doctor Weizmann (at a dinner in Ne w York). \" The Key to the doors of Palestine is not in the p ocket of the High Commissioner for Palestine, but i n the pocket of the Jews of America!\" Second Lord Melchet t. \" From a strategic point of view, such a developmen t (referring to extension of Jewish State to Trans- Jordania) is of tremendous importance to the British Empire. Palestine stands as a vital link in the chain of Im perial communications between the East and the West. It ho lds the key position for all air routes, and, in vi ew of the Egyptian situation, must always be a vital factor i n the development of air routes to East and South A frica.\" Once again we ask are these vital links of the Brit ish Empire, between India, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and other lands to be placed at the mercy of the Jew, Polish, American, Russian, or internation al? Are British soldiers to be shot on behalf of Zionism? I s justice to be denied forever to the Arabs? It is not for the caucus of .political parties, it is not for the Jew ish financiers, to decide, but it is for the Britis h people. Mr. E. T. Richmond in an article in the \"XIX Centur y and After\" for February, 1938, writes of the Government's policy in Palestine as \". . .The aggre ssion was planned, initiated, and is being carried out under the direction and control, not of British democracy , but of a special, ad hoc, conjunction of interest s and influences. From this conjunction proceeds a voice. That voice dictates action. It is the voice of a h idden"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"dictatorship; dictatorship, because it dictates; hi dden, because it cannot be related to any definite body. Two things at least are clear : first, the fruits produ ced by it are not of a character that is English; s econd, it stands for the coercion of the Arabs.\" Mr. Richmond occupied h igh official positions in Palestine, and was later Director of the Department of Antiquities in Palestine. To sum up. The British Union pities the Jew for the universal dislike he inspires throughout his histo ry, but the cry of \"persecution\" comes too glibly from the mout hs of those who by their money power have long persecuted Christendom. The Jewish problem cannot b e settled in Palestine; it will be but another outb reak of the universal disease. However, as by the Balfour D eclaration, Great Britain is responsible for the 40 0,000 Jews now settled in Palestine, this country must be prep ared in consequence to guarantee the minority right s and economic existence of the Jews, so long as this min ority group does not break, or contravene, in any w ay the laws of Palestine. The Balkanisation of the Middle East, undertaken in the postwar settlement and then exaggerated to a w orse degree by the French division of Syria into Syria p roper, Lebanon, Latakia, and now the Sanjak of Alexandretta, is the most provocative method to cre ate eternal dispute, as was the Balkanisation of So uth- eastern Europe before, and that of Central Europe a fter the war by the Treaty of Versailles. The prest ige of the great Powers rests not only on force but on conduct ; and there can be no question that the conduct of the allied Powers after the Great War has not been such as to bring prestige, especially in the Arab countries. Early in 1917 British aeroplanes dropped leaflets a ddressed \" To the Arab officers and soldiers in the Turkish Army in Palestine,\" which were signed \" The British Army in Palestine \" : \" To all Arabs and other off icers and men in the Ottoman Army. \" We have with much regret heard that you are right ing against us, who are working for the sake of pre serving the edicts of the Holy Moslem Religion from being a ltered and for liberating all Arabs from the Turkis h rule. \" We believe that the real truth has not reached yo u. We have therefore sent you this proclamation sea led by our seal to assure you that we are fighting for two nob le aims, the preservation of the religion and the f reedom of Arabs generally. \" We have sent strict orders to all the heads and m en of our tribes that if our army happens to captur e any one of you they should treat you well and send you to my s ons, who will welcome and well treat you. \" The Arab Kingdom has been for a long time in bond age to the Turks, who have killed your brethren, an d crucified your men and deported your women and fami lies and have altered your religion. How then can y ou stand this and bear the bitterness of continuing wi th them and agree to assist them? \"Come and join us who are labouring for the sake of religion and the freedom of the Arabs, so that the Arab Kingdom may again be come what it was during the time of your fathers, if God wills. God is the leader to the right path.\" Further the allied declaration of November 7th, 191 8, which is printed on page i of this brochure prom ising that administrations shall be created \" which shall draw their authority from the initiative and free choic e of indigenous populations \" is impossible to overlook without dishonour. The future of Palestine must lie in an incorporatio n with Trans-Jordania and with the Arab literal sta te of Syria, including the Maronite and Jewish minorities which will be given an Anglo-French guarantee. In the \" Contemporary Review \" of August, 1929, the writer outlined a method for the creation of the A rab Confederated States. This still holds good and cert ain steps towards this have already been taken. It remains, therefore, for the question of Palestine, Syria, an d the various subdivisions to be treated with the s ame boldness, and then peace and stability will come to the Middl e East. But the problem of the Jew remains and it must be s olved. British Union will do its best, in conjuncti on with the other great Powers, to place an area of the world i n the hands of the Jews which would be capable of r eceiving at least 10,000,000 and of sustaining this 10,000,0 00. British Union is not antagonistic to the creation o f a Jewish State, only not in Palestine, and would do its utmost towards the attainment of this ideal. The way of Na tional Socialism is neither to shirk responsibility nor to imagine a palliative is a cure, and thus to leave a disease more deeply rooted than ever for its child ren to solve or, more probably, from which to perish."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Speech delivered by Mrs. Mogannoum, one of the lead ing Arab feminists and wife of one of the Arab Leaders now in exile, in Bethlehem, November 10th, 1929. It is with reluctance that I dared accept the great honour conferred upon me, to be, as I believe, the first Arab lady to make a public address in this energetic Clu b in the ancient City of Bethlehem, the birth-place of one of the great messengers of peace to the world; before a mixed audience of men and women, including renown ed persons, as our friend Captain Gordon Canning, know n as the friend of the Arabs. Owing to the grave conditions in the country and th e imminent peril lying at our door, we feel that th e time has come for the Arab women to enter the public and pol itical arena and work side by side to support their men in their national struggle for life, liberty and indep endence. The Arab woman, Captain Canning, is not, and has no t been, as dormant as the Western world believed in the past. I believe, hitherto, she has been the inspira tion which pushed the men forward in their national struggle. Events of late have so stirred the country that we Arab women felt that it was our sacred duty to emer ge from behind the screen and step forward in the limelight to dispel any propaganda or notion that the Arab w omen are ignorant and backward. It is for this that the Arab women (Moslem and Christian), although I should no t make the distinction, as we are all one for home and cou ntry, have emerged from our homes to public life, c ontrary to the traditions of old. It might interest you to know, Captain Canning, tha t the Arab women who had an interview with His Excellency the High Commissioner and Lady Chancello r, told him that, not only will they appear before him for the first time in history, but they will, if ne ed be, sacrifice their very lives for their distres sed nation ! I cannot explain it to you better than the statemen t made to us ladies by His Eminence the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, when he said : \"The Arab National Moveme nt has so far been standing on one leg, but since t he Arab women have entered to work shoulder to shoulde r with their men, the National Movement is supporte d by two legs,\" and he was sure it cannot but succeed. Our sole aim is to insure and guarantee permanent p eace and harmony in this land of peace, the Holy La nd, the land of religion and revelation, the land which is dear and sacred to the three great religions in the world. We believe the policy followed Hitherto is not the kind of policy which will insure everlasting peace. How can you insure peace in a country where one small minor ity is aiming and striving to oust the great majori ty out of their home and country by means of their influence, propaganda and money ? Would you, Captain Canning, stand with folded arms when someone, by means of fo rce, and contrary to all laws, try to drive you out of your home and allow a stranger to take possession thereo f? Would you not, resist with all your might, in se lf-defence of home, hearth and property ? On behalf of the Arab women of Palestine, we want y ou to convey to the British public that we definite ly refuse and strongly resist a Jewish national home in our c ountry, as our country is far too small to contain two homes for two people widely differing from one another in culture and aspirations. Do convey to the British public that we refuse to h ave Palestine become the place of refuge for all th e discontented people of Southern and Eastern Europe, who have been flooding the country with Bolshevist ic and Communistic ideas. Impress upon them that such policy does not and wil l never guarantee the permanent peace which all Ara bs crave for. Bloodshed we abhor. Disturbances we abst ain from, for it is we women who pay after all, and pay dearest when such troubles occur. Allow us to live in peace ; allow us to develop our country in our o wn way, and let us take our time at it!

We are here this afternoon to greet Captain Canning heartily. He is our distinguished guest, and a sin cere friend to our people. We immensely thank him for his effor ts he has been unceasingly exerting in support of o ur cause. In view of this, we receive him as an apostl e of peace seeking for renewing friendly relations and means of amity between the two nations - British and Arab s. Every true Arab desires very much to see that these friendly relations are based on durably foundation s supported by the mutual interests which are very es sential to both nations. Geographical significance adds, much, in fact, to those interests being so reciproc al. The only way to preserve them as good and sound , and to secure development thereof, is to have them built'u p on sincere mutual co-operation. But to have them built upon force and bayonets, the result will be fruitle ss and no less than destructive. The Arabs, before the Great War, were sharing the T urks the administration of the whole State. They ha d seats in Parliament (in both houses), in Cabinet, in the Army and in every Department of the State. But, in due time, the spirit of independence and nationalism awoke in their hearts. Having their history before them, th ey started their way of restoring their glorious past. They di d not feel satisfied any longer to continue in comb ination with the Moslem Turks. The Arabs wanted freedom, togethe r with a separate national organism, so that they c ould rebuild their history and be able once more to cont ribute to world civilisation as an independent nati on. When the Arabs were in struggle for their independe nce, the Great War broke out. During that War, and at a very critical stage of its days, the British Govern ment gave the Arabs, through H.M. King Hussein, in 1915, solemn pledges as to the independence of the Arab c ountries, with which Palestine was included. The Arabs put their confidence in Great Britain's h onour and pledges ; and so they threw in all their lot with the Allies, and fought with them shoulder to shoulder t ill the end of the War. The substantial assistance rendered by the Arabs during the Great War, was very valuable, giving good results, passive and active. Lord Allenby, and many others as well, acknowledged the part played by the Arabs, which, indeed, was m ore or less, an important element of definite victory. The people of this country, being during the War co nfident that Great Britain would never make any departure f rom her pledges, received the British Army out ther e as an Allied Army. Shortly after that, however, the Arabs were alarmed by the saddening news of the BALFOUR DECLARATION, 1917, the object of which was to creat e in Palestine a national home for the JEWS. That declaration was, of course, in contradiction w ith those pledges given to the Arabs two years prev iously, and confirmed by proclamation of Lord Allenby when having entered the country. At any rate, the Arabs in general and the people of Palestine in particular, were exceedingly disappointed, and thus felt as tho ugh they were thunderstruck. Many British friends of ours be gan to say that the Balfour Declaration was only gi ven under certain compelling circumstances during the W ar, for reasons of financial and political consider ation, and that Great Britain would not break her word with us . But unfortunately we are very sorry to say now, t hat since then, up to this very day, we have seen nothing of the kind of fulfilling pledges given to the Arabs. What we have been seeing, pratically, is continuous adherence to the policy of Balfour Declaration - t hat policy, unjust and unnatural, which had been a sour ce of misfortunes and calamities Befalling us and b ringing us to a state of humiliation and servitude in our c ountry. That policy, called by Lord Balfour \"the po licy of dangerous experiment,\" and by Mr. Churchill \"the po licy of adventure,\" and described just recently by Mr. Merriman, the Council for the Jews before the Commi ssion of Enquiry, \"as a policy acknowledged to be o ne of experiment without any precedent in history,\" is th e source of all evils. It means, in theory and practice, to put this count ry, inhabited by about eight hundred thousand Arabs for more than thirteen centuries, from three directions surr ounded by Arab countries, and bejng holy in the eye s of half the people of the world, as you said to me yesterda y, under conditions politically, economically and administratively, favourable as to create a nationa l home for the Jews, who come over here from all pa rts of the world, describe this policy of Balfour Declaration just in one word, it suffices to say that it aims a t effecting an operation of gradual annihilation of bring with the m different languages, habits, customs and principl es. To an"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"already settled people in order to enable another p eople to install themselves in this place. Conseque ntly, the Arabs have been seeing many fatal results. They hav e been deprived from any amount of independence and national being. They have been taxed in a way many times heavier than the taxation levied on their bre thren in Syria, Iraq, and Trans-jordan. This taxation, need not say, is without justification. The greatest par t of the budget is an expenditure to safeguard the interests of the project of the national home. The Arabs wer e never consulted in any of the legislation. The country has been open for the Jews to come in. Obstacles were put in the way of Arab immigrants in America, so that they should not be able to return home. Thousands of dunums of land were transferred from the Arabs to the Jews as a result of the economic c risis and of non-support rendered to the Arab farme rs by the Government. It is very strange to say that the more the Jews are favourably treated, the more ambitiou s they become, and at last they made it open that they do let their ambitions reach the Arab holy places and Wakfs (Pious Foundations). Now, generally speaking, we fi nd that this policy, taken as a whole, was the reas on for the recent unfortunate disturbances, and for the blood that was shed in this country, which must be the ho me of peace. The Arabs in this country request all their British friends, and our distinguished guest, Captain Cann ing, is of the best of them, to be so good enough as to let th e noble British people know the real facts in this country. Furthermore, you are kindly requested to say, on ou r behalf, that the Arab nation, backed both by the Moslem world and the Christian world, demand persistently that Great Britain should bring this dangerous expe riment to an end, especially when it being proved by ten year s' experience, that that policy is bankrupt and fru itless. At the same time the Arabs demand that this dangerous policy, being radically and totally changed, anothe r one of justice and impartiality be substituted for the for mer. We demand that Great Britain sincerely fulfil her p ledges which she gave us, so that we are enabled as to achieve our independence. The Arabs, who had a bril liant past and history, and are now of a great numb er of millions, inhabiting countries of the best geograph ical positions, enjoying a fine language and a mode rn revival, wish very much, that friendship between the two nat ions be founded on purely amity and mutual interest s, and not on force and subordination. The Arabs cannot tolerate any longer the policy of annihilation. They foresee that if this policy cont inued, they should have in future, as a result of it, as fatal a destiny as could be imagined—it would be a destin y like that foreseen by a man to whose body germs of tuberculos is nature are introduced. He keeps lying in bed, no fresh air to come in, no nourishing food available, waiti ng his last moment! He feels that any kind of death other than this would be easier for him and less terrible. Lastly, we request you to say to your noble people that the Arabs (whose history you are well versed i n) are quite justified in demanding to see justice done to them, and that the Arabs were and still are a peop le who love justice. Gustav Loubon has said that history never saw a conquering people a more merciful nation and more just than the Arabs. The Arabs, you may be assured, when they are independent, will let the world see again that they are the same Arabs who showed that justic e in the past. My last word is that all of us wish you a good time among us in this country. "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Detailed account of a 'British Concentration Camp. This report deals with the actual conditions of \"El Mazraah\" concentration camp situated opposite the Labour Farm Co., about two kilometres from Acra, on the se ashore, and which is the place where Arabs are bein g interned. (a) General Description. This concentration camp is divided into three block s, two of which consist of eight huts each and the third of four huts. Each block is separated from the others by wire and the occupants of the one block do not m ix with those of the others. Each hut measures 20 x 5 metre s and has twenty windows and two doors. The windows have no glass panes but only shutters (blinds). The huts are opened at 5 a.m. and closed at 4.30 p.m. in winter, and with sunset in summer. The internees are allowe d out in the camp during this time, but there is ne ither shelter nor trees, and all they can do is to lie in the shade of their huts. (b) Accommodation. The internees are accommodated 35-40 in each hut. T hey are allowed each a straw mattress for bedding, with four blankets in winter and two in summer. They sle ep on these mattresses on the floor, and are allowe d neither cushions under the head nor sheets. They sleep clos e to each other as there is no distance between the mattresses on the floor. They have neither chairs n or tables; in fact not a single piece of furniture, and for the purpose of eating they sit on the board of the matt ress. Only shelves exist where clothing is packed. The place is cold in winter, and humidity is felt from the concr ete floor, which is wet under the mattress. Upon co mplaints straw mats were allowed in winter under the mattres ses and celotex sheets put on the walls for the col d. In summer the place is alive with bugs. (c) Sanitation. Each internee does his own washing of clothing and underwear, but regular prisoners do the cleaning up of the camp. Since 1938 or end of 1937 the sanitary conditions h ave been greatly improved; washing facilities are n ow provided with running water, and hot water is suppl ied three times a week. Shaving is not allowed; onl y hair cut with a machine and between the internees themselves , but no hairdresser is allowed to enter. Before 19 38 buckets were supplied inside the huts and exposed u ncovered for night use, but since then a sort of ca bin has been made in each hut with a closing door where two buckets are in use for the night. (d) Food. The food supply is very poor. Those who have means can arrange for food to be supplied from outside. T he less fortunate have to subsist on the ration. Food is su pplied twice a day, and the first meal is not serve d before 11 o'clock in the morning, consisting of bread with a piece of cheese or halaweh (locally made sweet) or olives or leban (sour milk) with a raw onion. The second meal is served at 4 p.m., and consists of bread, lentil s or rice soup. Meat is supplied twice a week, but in a very small portion, and beans are sometimes served in li eu of soup, and one orange once a week. A primus is allow ed in day-time inside the huts if internees wish to make a cup of coffee or tea on their own, but everything i s made and served on the floor. (e) Visitors. Visitors for Moslem internees are allowed on Friday s and for Christians on Sundays, between the hours of 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., and for the period of 15 minutes. U nless with special permission and in the presence o f a police constable, the visits are public, and about fifty v isitors are allowed at a time to stand behind a lar ge wire netting fence; and, on the opposite side, stand the interne es behind a similar fence with a distance of about 4 metres, filled with barbed wire, between the two parties. (f) Medical Attendance."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" There is a permanent clinic with one male attendant . A Doctor visits the camp daily; serious cases are transferred to Hospital in Acre prison. (g) Newspapers and books are allowed and cigarettes up to four packets per w eek (each packet from 20-27 cigarettes). No matches are allowed, but a cigarett e lighter is permitted. No money is allowed, and there is nothing that the internee could buy. No ice may be brought in. There is no library, nor any kind of distraction. The light is put out at 8 p.m. in all the huts, and one hurrican e lamp is allowed for each hut after that time. Administration. An English Police Superintendent is in charge of t he camp.
